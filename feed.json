      "The jokesters' custom has been around for hundreds of years, although its exact birth is difficult to pinpoint. These days, depending on your location, it could be marked with a fish secretly pinned to someone's back or a whoopee cushion or even news reports of flying penguins (yes, that actually happened ).",
      "In the U.S., the pranks are typically followed by screams of \u201cApril Fools!\u201d to make sure all are aware that they were the unsuspecting recipient of a practical joke.",
      "Here are some thing to know about April Fools\u2019 Day and its history:",
      "There are plenty of theories about where this day of pranks and hoaxes came from. It's not clear exactly which one might be true. But what is clear is that April Fools\u2019 Day has roots stretching back hundreds of years.",
      "One idea is that it dates back to France in 1564, when King Charles IX moved the New Year celebration from its weeklong observance beginning March 25 to a celebration on Jan. 1, according to the Library of Congress. Those who forgot or were never told about the change were mocked. Although the library notes that the true history of the New Year is more complicated, as different parts of the country observed it on different days.",
      "A similar theory ties April Fools\u2019 Day to the 1582 change from the Julian to the Gregorian calendar, according to the library. But it explains that this type of origin story has been used to explain several holidays and may be more of a \u201cmigratory legend.\u201d",
      "And then there's the theory that it could be connected to the March 21 vernal equinox, which is known as a day when people are tricked by unexpected weather changes, according to Encyclopedia Britannica.",
      "Whatever its origin, the first time there was clear documented reference to the day was in 1561 when the Flemish writer Eduard De Dene wrote in his poem about a nobleman sending his servant on pointless tasks, according to the Library of Congress. The servant soon realizes that he has been \u201csent on \u2018fool\u2019s errands\u2019 because it\u2019s April 1,\u201d the library states.",
      "In 2021, then-first lady Jill Biden pretended to be a flight attendant on an airplane traveling from California to Washington. She wore a \u201cJasmine\u201d nametag and passed out Dove ice cream bars while wearing a black mask, black pantsuit and wig. A few minutes later, \u201cJasmine\u201d reemerged without the wig \u2014 revealing herself to be Jill Biden, laughing and proclaiming, \u201cApril Fools!\u201d",
      "Google co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin became known for announcing outlandish ideas every April Fools\u2019 Day soon after starting their company more than a quarter century ago. One year, Google posted a job opening for a Copernicus research center on the moon. Another year, the company said it planned to roll out a \u201cscratch and sniff\u201d feature on its search engine.",
      "In 1992, NPR 's \u201cTalk of the Nation\u201d program announced that former-President Richard Nixon, who resigned in 1974, would be running for president, according to the Museum of Hoaxes. A comedian had impersonated Nixon to say, \u201cI never did anything wrong, and I won\u2019t do it again.\u201d",
      "Outside of the U.S., one of the most notable pranks involved the BBC World Service in 1980 declaring that Big Ben would become a digital clock and renamed Digital Dave, according to the UK Parliament.",
      "From Scotland to Iceland to the U.S., the day is honored in a wide array of ways.",
      "In France, the day is known as poisson d\u2019avril, or \u201cApril Fish,\u201d and has long had a fish-themed pranking tradition. In modern times, it\u2019s become more of a day for children to relish in attaching paper fish to their friends\u2019 backs, Atlas Obscura says.",
      "In Scotland, April Fools' has a history of being a two-day event. April 1 is known as \u201cGowkie Day\u201d or \u201cHunt the Gowk,\u201d explained Encyclopedia Britannica. Gowk is a term used to describe a fool. On April 2, the celebration may become more physical, with children attaching \u201ckick me\u201d signs to people\u2019s backs.",
      "The day is also celebrated in Iceland, with the aim being to get people to \u201chlaupa apr\u00edl,\u201d or \u201cmake an April run.\u201d In other words, to trick someone in a way that makes them travel to a different location. News agencies have also been known to participate in pranking people. In 2014, for example, Iceland Review ran a story with the headline, \u201cGoogle Signs Deal with Iceland,\u201d saying the fake news was part of \u201ca long-standing tradition of the Icelandic media.\u201d",

      "The ruling from a New Mexico judge allows the possible release of redacted police body camera video and other investigative materials, including images of the couple's dead dog. All photos, video and documents from the investigation had been restricted from release by an earlier, temporary court order.",
      "\u201cThere shall be no depiction of either body in any video production\u201d or photographic image of the bodies, Santa Fe-based Judge Matthew Wilson said in response to questions from attorneys on his ruling.",

      "The partially mummified remains of Hackman and Arakawa were found in their Santa Fe home on Feb. 26, when maintenance and security workers showed up at the home and alerted police.",
      "Authorities have said Hackman, 95, died of heart disease with complications from Alzheimer\u2019s disease about a week after his wife died of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, which is a rare, rodent-borne disease. Hackman may have been unaware Arakawa, 65, was dead.",
      "One of the couple\u2019s three dogs, a kelpie mix named Zinna, also was found dead in a crate in a bathroom closet near Arakawa, while two other dogs were found alive. A state veterinary lab tied the dog's death to dehydration and starvation.",
      "Authorities unraveled the mysterious circumstances of the couple\u2019s deaths and described their conclusions at a March 7 news conference without releasing most related written and photographic records.",
      "New Mexico\u2019s open records law blocks public access to sensitive images, including depictions of dead bodies. Experts also say some medical information is not considered public record under the state Inspection of Public Records Act.",
      "In seeking to block the release of records, estate representative Julia Peters had emphasized the possibly shocking nature of photographs and video in the investigation and potential for their dissemination by media. The Hackman family estate also sought to block the eventual release of autopsy reports by the Office of the Medical Investigator and death investigation reports by the Santa Fe County Sheriff\u2019s Office.",
      "An attorney for the estate, Kurt Sommer, argued during Monday's hearing that the couple took great pains to stay out of the public light during their lifetimes and that the right to control the use of their names and likenesses should extend to their estate in death.",
      "The bulk of death investigations by law enforcement and autopsy reports by medical investigators are typically considered public records under state law in the spirit of ensuring government transparency and accountability.",
      "The Associated Press, CBS News and CBS Studios intervened in the matter. Gregory P. Williams, an attorney for the news outlets, told the judge that they had previously said in court filings that they would not disseminate images of the couple's bodies and would blur images to obscure them from other records.",
      "\u201cThere is certainly a public interest in knowing how their deaths were investigated and knowing how that was handled,\u201d Williams said.",
      "Susan Madore, a publicist who had worked with the Hackmans for years, testified that the couple relished living in Santa Fe because it afforded them anonymity. Hackman retired in the early 2000s.",
      "Arakawa had no children, while Hackman is survived by three children from a previous marriage.",
      "At Monday's hearing, an attorney for Hackman's son and daughters highlighted the possible traumatic effects of releasing conversations about the deaths within police body camera videos.",
      "Scot Sauder, an attorney for the state medical investigator, told the judge that autopsy reports for Hackman and his wife do not yet exist and won\u2019t include past health care information once completed. It can take months for autopsy reports to be completed.",
      "Privacy likely also will play a role as the couple\u2019s estate is settled. According to probate court documents, Hackman signed an updated will in 2005 leaving his estate to his wife while the will she signed that year directed her estate to him. With both dying, management of the estate is in Peters' hands.",

      "At the same time, Amazon MGM Studios\u2019 \u201cA Working Man,\u201d directed by David Ayer, beat expectations with a $15.2 million debut. Co-written by Sylvester Stallone, \u201cA Working Man\u201d reteams Statham and Ayer following last year\u2019s successful \u201cThe Beekeeper\u201d ($162 million worldwide). This time around, Statham plays a construction worker with an elite military past.",
      "While reviews have been mixed and audiences only gave \u201cA Working Man\u201d a \u201cB\u201d CinemaScore, showing Statham has carved out something rare in the movie industry today: bankability. \u201cA Working Man\u201d opened similarly to \u201cThe Beekeeper,\u201d which launched with $16.5 million.",
      "The bigger headline, though, might have been the fast erosion of ticket buyers' appetite for \u201cSnow White.\u201d The film, directed by Marc Webb and starring Rachel Zegler, had been hoped to lift movie theaters after a painful start to 2025. Produced for more $250 million, the film has turned into a poisoned apple, with a two-week global haul of $143.1 million.",
      "Next weekend, Warner Bros.\u2019 \u201cA Minecraft Movie,\u201d is expected to win the weekend and will, like \u201cSnow White,\u201d target family audiences.",
      "A trio of newcomers \u2013 A24\u2019s \u201cDeath of a Unicorn,\u201d Universal and Blumhouse\u2019s \u201cThe Woman in the Yard,\u201d and the Fathom\u2019s \u201cChosen: The Last Supper\u201d \u2013 also opened over the weekend, though none made a big impact.",
      "\u201cThe Chosen: The Last Supper,\u201d fared the best, with $11.5 million in 2,235 theaters. The Christian TV series, now in its fifth season, has regularly driven ticket sales before streaming. More episodes will roll out in theaters through April.",
      "\u201cDeath of a Unicorn,\u201d a horror comedy starring Jenna Ortega and Paul Rudd, portrays a father and daughter who hit a unicorn on the road while they're driving. The movie collected a modest $5.8 million from 3,050 theaters.",
      "The weekend\u2019s more straightforward horror contender, Blumhouse\u2019s \u201cThe Woman in the Yard,\u201d starring Danielle Deadwyler, debuted with $9.4 million from 2,842 cinemas. In \u201cBlack Adam\u201d director Jaume Collet-Serra\u2019s film, a mysterious woman keeps appearing in a family\u2019s front yard. Though it cost little to make, with a production budget of $12 million, it has been slammed by critics.",
      "One of the weekend\u2019s biggest successes was the 1997 Studio Ghibli classic \u201cPrincess Mononoke.\" The Hayo Miyazaki film grossed $4 million across just 347 IMAX screens. Distributor GKids touted that result as a victory for humanity over technology. Earlier in the week, a new version of ChatGPT allowed users to render images in Studio Ghibli-like animation.",
      "Sony Pictures Classic\u2019s \u201cThe Penguin Lesson,\u201d starring Steve Coogan and Jonathan Pryce, opened with $1.2 million at 1,017 theaters. Coogan plays an Englishman teaching in Argentina in 1976 who rescues a penguin from an oil spill.",
      "With flagging ticket sales overall, Hollywood marked the first quarter of 2025 with a sizeable box-office deficit. Sales are down 11% from the same point in 2024, and nearly 40% from 2019, according to Comscore.",
      "\u201cHopefully \u2018Minecraft\u2019 can help the marketplace level up since after some underwhelming weekends at the box office we need to get some momentum back at the multiplex,\u201d said Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst for Comscore.",
      "With final domestic figures due Monday, the following list factors in estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to Comscore:",
      "1. \u201cA Working Man,\u201d $15.2 million",

      "LOS ANGELES -- Richard Chamberlain, the handsome hero of the 1960s television series \"Dr. Kildare\" who found a second career as an award-winning \"king of the miniseries,\" has died. He was 90.",
      "Chamberlain died Saturday night in Waimanalo, Hawaii, of complications following a stroke, according to his publicist, Harlan Boll.",
      "\u201cOur beloved Richard is with the angels now. He is free and soaring to those loved ones before us,\" Martin Rabbett, his lifelong partner, said in a statement. \"How blessed were we to have known such an amazing and loving soul. Love never dies. And our love is under his wings lifting him to his next great adventure.\u201d",
      "Tall, with classic good looks and romantic style, Chamberlain became an instant favorite with teenage girls as the compassionate physician on the TV series that aired from 1961 to 1966. Photoplay magazine named him most popular male star for three years in a row, from 1963-65.",
      "Not until 2003 did he acknowledge publicly what Hollywood insiders had long known, that he was gay. He made the revelation in his autobiography, \"Shattered Love.\"",
      "The actor became known as \"king of the TV miniseries\" in 1978 when he landed the starring role in \"Centennial,\" an epic production 24 hours long and based on James Michener's sprawling novel. He followed that in 1980 with \"Shogun,\" another costly, epic miniseries based on James Clavell's period piece about an American visitor to Japan.",
      "He scored his greatest miniseries success in 1983 with another long-form drama, \"The Thorn Birds,\" based on Colleen McCullough's best-seller. He played Father Ralph de Bricassart, a Roman Catholic priest in Australia who falls in love with beautiful Meggie Cleary (Rachel Ward). The ABC production, which also starred Barbara Stanwyck, reportedly attracted 100 million viewers.",
      "Chamberlain won Golden Globes for his work in \u201cShogun\" and \u201cThe Thorn Birds.\u201d Years earlier, he received one for \u201cDr. Kildare.\u201d",
      "When the public began to lose interest in miniseries, Chamberlain turned to the theater, where he displayed a fine singing voice. He appeared as Henry Higgins in a 1994 Broadway revival of \"My Fair Lady\" and as Captain von Trapp in a 1999 revival of \"The Sound of Music.\"",
      "He reprised his role of de Bricassart in the 1996 TV movie \"The Thorn Birds: The Missing Years.\"",
      "He also appeared in numerous films, including \"The Music Lovers\" (as Tchaikovsky), \"The Madwoman of Chaillot,\" \"The Towering Inferno\" and \"The Three Musketeers\" and its sequels.",
      "The \"Kildare\" series was based on a string of successful 1930s and '40s films that had starred Lew Ayres in the title role.",
      "Chamberlain's hunky, all-American appearance made him an overnight star. Another medical show that debuted the same season, \"Ben Casey,\" also was a smash and made its leading man, the darkly handsome Vince Edwards, a star, too.",
      "The \"Ben Casey shirt\" became a fashion item, both shows' theme songs made the pop Top 40 (the Kildare song performed by Chamberlain himself) and there was even a pop song called \"Dr. Kildare! Dr. Casey! You Are Wanted for Consultation.\"",
      "But in his book, Chamberlain recounted how he was forced to hide his sexuality. He would escort glamorous actresses to movie premieres and other public events at the request of studio executives and dodge reporters' questions about why he had never married with a stock reply: \"Getting married would be great, but I'm awfully busy now.\"",
      "\"When I grew up, being gay, being a sissy or anything like that was verboten,\" he said in an NBC interview. \"I disliked myself intensely and feared this part of myself intensely and had to hide it.\"",
      "The book also described a troubled childhood and an alcoholic father, and Chamberlain said that writing it finally lifted a heavy emotional burden. He also expressed relief that he was no longer hiding his sexuality.",
      "\"I played a cat-and-mouse game with the press. Game over,\" said Chamberlain.",
      "Born George Richard Chamberlain in Beverly Hills on March 31, 1934, the actor originally studied at Pomona College to be a painter. But after returning from the Army, where he had served as an infantry clerk in the Korean War, Chamberlain decided to try acting.",
      "He studied voice and drama, and after appearing in guest roles in a handful of TV shows and in the 1960 film \"The Secret of the Purple Reef,\" he won the Dr. Kildare role.",
      "When \u201cDr. Kildare\u201d was canceled he initially found it difficult to shake the image of the handsome young physician.",
      "He moved to England for a time to find work and hone his acting skills. While there, he appeared in three of director Richard Lester\u2019s films, \u201cPetulia\u201d (1968), \u201cThe Three Musketeers\u201d (1973) and \u201cThe Four Musketeers\u201d (1974). He reunited with Lester in 1989 for \u201cThe Return of the Musketeers,\u201d once more playing Aramis.",
      "In 1969, Chamberlain played the title role in \u201cHamlet\u201d at England\u2019s Birmingham Repertory Company and repeated it in a TV adaptation that appeared on NBC in the United States. He also appeared as Octavius in a film version of \u201cJulius Caesar,\u201d which co-starred Charlton Heston and Jason Robards.",
      "He continued to act well into the 21st century, appearing on such television shows as \u201cWill & Grace,\u201d \u201cThe Drew Carey Show\u201d and \u201cTouched by an Angel.\u201d",

      "NEW YORK -- After mounting criticism following its initial response to the violent attack on Oscar-winning \u201cNo Other Land\u201d co-director Hamdan Ballal, the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences apologized Friday for not acknowledging Ballal by name.",
      "In a letter to academy members, academy CEO Bill Kramer and its president, Janet Yang, said they regretted not issuing a direct statement on Ballal. The director on Monday, witnesses said, was beaten by Israeli settlers in the West Bank and then detained by the Israeli military.",
      "The attack, just weeks after Ballal and his fellow directors won best documentary at the Academy Awards, was widely condemned by numerous film organizations, among others. The academy on Wednesday released a statement condemning \u201charming or suppressing artists for their work or their viewpoints.\"",
      "Yuval Abraham, a journalist and co-director of \u201cNo Other Land,\u201d was highly critical of that response, comparing it to \u201csilence on Hamdan's assault.\"",
      "On Friday, more than 600 of the academy's 11,000 members issued an open letter saying the academy's statement \"fell far short of the sentiments this moment calls for.\u201d Among the signatories were Joaquin Phoenix, Olivia Colman, Riz Ahmed, Emma Thompson, Javier Bardem, Pen\u00e9lope Cruz and \u201cThe Zone of Interest\u201d filmmaker Jonathan Glazer.",
      "After a meeting Friday by the academy's board of governors, Kramer and Yang responded with a new statement.",
      "\u201cWe sincerely apologize to Mr. Ballal and all artists who felt unsupported by our previous statement and want to make it clear that the academy condemns violence of this kind anywhere in the world,\u201d they wrote to members. \"We abhor the suppression of free speech under any circumstances.\u201d",
      "After being detained for more than 20 hours, Ballal was released by Israeli soldiers. Ballal and two other Palestinians were accused of throwing stones at a settler, allegations they deny. After being released, Ballal told The Associated Press a settler kicked his head \u201clike a football\u201d during an attack on his village.",
      "\u201cI realized they were attacking me specifically,\u201d Ballal said at a West Bank hospital after his release Tuesday. \u201cWhen they say \u2018Oscar\u2019, you understand. When they say your name, you understand.\u201d",
      "\u201cNo Other Land,\u201d a joint Israeli-Palestinian production, chronicles the situation in Masafer Yatta, which the Israeli military designated as a live-fire training zone in the 1980s and ordered the expulsion of the residents, mostly Arab Bedouin. Around 1,000 residents have largely remained in place, but soldiers regularly come in to demolish homes, tents, water tanks and olive orchards.",
      "After not finding a U.S. distributor despite wide acclaim, \u201cNo Other Land\u201d was self-released in theaters. It still managed to surpass $2 million in North American theaters.",

Nearly 50 years ago, the Sex Pistols \u2014 then made up of vocalist Johnny Rotten, guitarist Steve Jones, drummer Paul Cook and bassist Glen Matlock \u2014 performed at the 100 Club Punk Special in London, a 140-capacity club, alongside Subway Sect, Siouxsie and the Banshees and The Clash.",
      "The event marked a shift for the subcultural movement; the bands here would soon bring their underground culture to reach mainstream heights.",
      "Now, the 2025 iteration of the Pistols \u2014 Jones, Cooke and Matlock joined by frontman Frank Carter (of Gallows, Pure Love and Frank Carter and the Rattlesnakes) \u2014 sit in the same venue to discuss their forthcoming North American tour. \u201cThis is where it all kicked off, really, all the punk,\u201d says Cook.",
      "This fall, the legendary punk band will embark on their first tour of North America since 2003, when they were joined by John Lydon (formerly Rotten.) The 2025 run with Carter begins Sept. 16 at the Longhorn Ballroom in Dallas, Texas \u2014 the site of a particularly hostile show for the band when it first toured the U.S. in 1978.",
      "Jones recalls having \u201cpigs' hooves and bottles and what not slung at us by cowboys.\u201d",
      "It is one of a few dates featured in three \u201cLive in the U.S.A.\u201d albums, documenting the band's '78 run: Atlanta, Dallas and San Francisco. The latter will release April 25 and captures the show where the band originally called it quits.",
      "\"We were thinking of breaking up in San Francisco again,\" Jones jokes.",
      "The 2025 tour is currently scheduled to conclude Oct. 16 at the Hollywood Palladium in Los Angeles. The band will hit Washington; Philadelphia; Brooklyn, New York; Montreal; Toronto; Cleveland; Detroit; Minneapolis; Denver; Seattle and San Francisco. Additional tour dates will be announced later.",
      "Pre-sale opens April 2 and 3. Tickets go on sale April 4 at 10 a.m. local time.",
      "They will perform the band's sole album, 1977\u2019s \u201cNever Mind the Bollocks, Here\u2019s the Sex Pistols Album\u201d live in its entirety as well as other material.",
      "So, why tour the U.S. and Canada now?",
      "\u201cWhy not?\u201d says Jones.",
      "\u201cI think everybody needs this band right now. I think the world needs this band right now,\u201d says Carter. \u201cAnd I think definitely America is screaming out for a band like the Sex Pistols.\u201d",
      "\u201cAt the end of the day, we\u2019re living in a really, really difficult time. So not only do people want to come and just be entertained, they want to enjoy themselves,\u201d he continued. \u201cPunk is an energetic music. It\u2019s one where you can go and vent and let your hair down, hopefully in a safe manner. Fingers crossed, no bottles or pigs' hooves.\u201d",
      "Carter fronted the Sex Pistols last year for a few U.K. dates. The band says they did not reach out to Lydon to see if he wanted to participate in this reunion tour.",
      "\u201cThe last thing he wants to do is have anything to do with us right now,\u201d says Jones, referring to a previous lawsuit between the singer and the band over music use in their TV series \u201cPistol.\u201d The judge ruled against Lydon's opposition.",
      "\u201cWe wish him the best,\" Jones said.",
      "\u201cGood luck to him,\u201d adds Matlock. \u201cI wish he thinks, maybe, \u2018good luck\u2019 to us. Probably doesn't. But over the years, John (has had) all our phone numbers, and I can't see many missed calls from him.\u201d",
      "As for the 2025 tour: Fans shouldn't expect the violence of their 1978 run, but they should anticipate a tighter performance.",
      "\u201cWe're a bit older but we play just as well, if not better,\u201d says Matlock. \u201cAnd I think that\u2019s something that\u2019s got a great deal of aplomb that we\u2019re going to bring to the public over there.\u201d",
      "Does this mean there could be new Sex Pistols music in the future? \u201cIt's early days,\u201d says Jones. \u201cLet's see what happens.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "At Hong Kong\u2019s Art Basel, painter Chow Chun-fai\u2019s new works transport viewers back to the night in 1997 when the former British colony returned to Chinese rule, displayed in the very exhibition center where one era ended and another began",
      "HONG KONG -- At Hong Kong\u2019s Art Basel, painter Chow Chun-fai\u2019s new works transport viewers back to the night in 1997 when the former British colony returned to Chinese rule, displayed in the very exhibition center where one era ended and another began.",
      "That transformation in the city's post-colonial era has taken a drastic turn since 2020, when China imposed a national security law that virtually wiped out dissent. The law drove many middle-class families and young professionals, including artists, to emigrate to democracies like Britain, Canada, Taiwan and the U.S. from what was once a haven for free expression in Asia.",
      "But others, like Chow, chose to stay and continue to document their home city despite unclear red lines. His works at Art Basel, which opens to the public on Friday, revisit Hong Kongers\u2019 collective memories of the late 1990s and early 2000s, a time many were proud of the Chinese financial hub\u2019s vibrancy and openness.",
      "\u201cWhile studying art, we\u2019ve learned many artists faced momentous times. Since we are living through such a momentous time ourselves now, I will continue to learn from it,\" he said in an interview ahead of the exhibition.",
      "Chow is perhaps best known to those outside art circles for his witty recreations of classic movie scenes with bilingual subtitles that lead audiences to reflect on Hong Kong's history and identity. He was also in the news when he ran against pro-establishment candidates in the 2012 legislative election and the 2016 election committee race, though he ultimately lost both contests.",
      "At Art Basel, Chow's paintings revisit significant news events, from the 1997 handover and overseas trips made by former top Chinese leaders to the celebration of China becoming the host of the 2008 Olympic Games.",
      "His works center on some of the biggest news stories covered by Sharon Cheung, a former journalist and now local gallery director.",
      "In 2000, late former Chinese President Jiang Zemin berated Cheung for asking what he called \u201ctoo simple, sometimes naive\u201d questions. She'd asked Jiang if his support for then-Hong Kong leader Tung Chee-hwa gave the impression of an imperial-style appointment. One of Chow\u2019s paintings illustrates that scene.",
      "Another set of Chow's paintings that will be shown, titled \u201cPanda,\u201d captures Jiang\u2019s personality from another side, documenting his light-hearted response to a question about pandas during a 2002 U.S. trip. He replied in English with a laugh: \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I am an electrical power engineer.\" Zhang said he was not a panda expert and quoted a Confucian saying about the virtue of acknowledging what one doesn\u2019t know.",
      "Chow said he included the work in the exhibition because pandas have become a trending topic in Hong Kong, where twins born last year sparked a bear craze. Jiang's response shows the characteristics of Chinese leaders back then, he said.",
      "Some 20 years later, Chinese leaders no longer have such open exchanges with Hong Kong journalists. Last year, China\u2019s government even eliminated an annual news conference by the premier, one of the rare times a top Chinese leader took questions from journalists.",
      "In Hong Kong, Beijing has doubled down on its control following 2019 anti-government protests. Many leading pro-democracy activists were prosecuted and jailed under the security law. Apple Daily and Stand News, news outlets known for their critical reports of the government, were shut down in 2021 after their top editors were arrested.",
      "The cultural sector has felt the chilling effect.",
      "In 2021, the government introduced amendments to its film censorship law on national security grounds. Some filmmakers have stopped screening their work in the city. Cultural works that diverge from government positions have lost funding. Booksellers practice self-censorship at the city's book fair, and local libraries in 2023 pulled titles related to the 1989 Tiananmen Square crackdown in Beijing and some political figures.",
      "Cheung, director of SC Gallery, said people have become more cautious about expressing their thoughts, but that she and Chow will not let fear stop them. Art\u2019s sense of distance allows room for interpretation, Cheung said.",
      "\u201cWe're not trying to tell people something. It's more about what people take away when they look at these images,\u201d she said.",
      "Chow said he never planned to leave Hong Kong despite the city's drastic changes, noting that artists who lived through major changes in the past produced great work.",
      "\u201cToday, finding ourselves in this moment of transformation, how could I, as a creative professional, not be here to witness it personally?\u201d he said.",

      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump on Thursday revealed his intention to force changes at the Smithsonian Institution with an executive order that targets funding for programs that advance \u201cdivisive narratives\u201d and \u201cimproper ideology,\" the latest step in a broadside against culture he deems too liberal.",
      "Trump claimed there has been a \u201cconcerted and widespread\u201d effort over the past decade to rewrite American history by replacing \u201cobjective facts\u201d with a \u201cdistorted narrative driven by ideology rather than truth,\" adding that it casts the \u201cfounding principles\u201d of the United States in a \u201cnegative light.\u201d",
      "The order he signed behind closed doors puts Vice President JD Vance, who serves on the Smithsonian Institution's Board of Regents, in charge of overseeing efforts to \u201cremove improper ideology\u201d from all areas of the institution, including its museums, education and research centers, and the National Zoo.",
      "It marks the Republican president's latest salvo against cultural pillars of society, such as universities and art, that he considers out of step with conservative sensibilities. Trump recently had himself installed as chairman of the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts with the aim of overhauling programming, including the annual Kennedy Center Honors awards show. The administration also recently forced Columbia University to make a series of policy changes by threatening the Ivy League school with the loss of several hundred million dollars in federal funding.",
      "The executive order also hints at the return of statues and monuments of Confederate figures, many of which were taken down or replaced around the country after the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis in 2020 and the rise of the Black Lives Matter movement, which is detested by Trump and other conservatives.",
      "The order also calls for improvements to Independence Hall in Philadelphia by July 4, 2026, in time for the 250th anniversary of the signing of the Declaration of Independence.",
      "Trump singled out the National Museum of African American History and Culture, which opened in 2016 near the White House, the Women's History Museum, which is in development, and the American Art Museum for criticism.",
      "\u201cMuseums in our Nation's capital should be places where individuals go to learn \u2014 not to be subjected to ideological indoctrination or divisive narratives that distort our shared history,\u201d he said.",
      "Linda St. Thomas, the Smithsonian Institution\u2019s chief spokesperson, said in an email late Thursday, \u201cWe have no comment for now.\u201d",
      "Under Trump\u2019s order, Vance will also work with the White House budget office to make sure future funding for the Smithsonian Institution isn\u2019t spent on programs that \u201cdegrade shared American values, divide Americans based on race, or promote programs or ideologies inconsistent with federal law and policy.\u201d Trump also wants to ensure that the women\u2019s history museum celebrates women and not \u201crecognize men as women in any respect.\u201d",
      "It also requires the interior secretary to reinstate monuments, memorials, statues and similar properties that have been removed or changed since Jan. 1, 2020, to \u201cperpetuate a false reconstruction of American history, inappropriately minimize the value of certain historical events or figures, or include any other improper partisan ideology.\u201d",
      "The Smithsonian Institution is the world\u2019s largest museum, education and research complex. It consists of 21 museums and the National Zoo. Eleven museums are located along the National Mall in Washington.",
      "The institution was established by Congress with money from James Smithson, a British scientist who left his estate to the United States to found \u201cat Washington, under the name of the Smithsonian Institution, an establishment for the increase and diffusion of knowledge.\u201d",

      "Yolanda Sald\u00edvar, 64, was up for parole for the first time since the killing of the singer, known to fans as simply Selena.",
      "One of the first Mexican American artists to break into the mainstream music scene, Selena shattered barriers for women in Latin music. She was 23 years old and on the verge of crossing over into English-language pop superstardom when she was killed.",
      "The singer's family and Chris P\u00e9rez, her widower, expressed gratitude to the Texas Board of Pardon and Paroles.",
      "\u201cWhile nothing can bring Selena back, this decision reaffirms that justice continues to stand for the beautiful life that was taken from us and from millions of fans around the world far too soon,\u201d they said in a statement posted on social media.",
      "In explaining the decision to deny parole, the board said in a statement that the panel found that Sald\u00edvar continues to pose a threat to public safety. It also said the nature of the crime indicated \u201ca conscious disregard for the lives, safety, or property of others.\u201d",
      "Sald\u00edvar, who is serving her sentence in a Gatesville prison, will be eligible to be reviewed again for parole in 2030.",
      "Sald\u00edvar founded Selena\u2019s fan club and was the manager of the singer\u2019s clothing boutiques, Selena Etc., until she was fired in early March 1995 after money was discovered missing.",
      "Selena, a Corpus Christi native, was shot in the back with a .38-caliber revolver at a Days Inn motel in Corpus Christi on March 31, 1995. She was able to run to the motel lobby, where she collapsed, and she was pronounced dead at a hospital an hour later.",

      "More than 50,000 people lined up to view Selena\u2019s body the day before she was laid to rest in Seaside Memorial Park on April 3, 1995, just 13 days before her 24th birthday.",
      "Sald\u00edvar\u2019s trial was moved to Houston because of the publicity surrounding the case. Sald\u00edvar testified that she had intended to kill herself during the confrontation with Selena but the gun misfired.",
      "On Oct. 23, 1995, a jury convicted Sald\u00edvar of first-degree murder. She was sentenced to life in prison with the possibility of parole after 30 years.",
      "While in prison, Sald\u00edvar, a former nurse, obtained her paralegal and associate degree in criminal justice. She has filed several civil rights complaints alleging mistreatment by the state\u2019s prison system, according to court records, and she also helped other inmates file petitions.",
      "In court documents from 2016, Sald\u00edvar said she was being held in protective custody \u2014 meaning she was segregated from other inmates \u2014 because prison officials were concerned for her safety due to the \u201chigh profile\u201d nature of her case. She filed several appeals of her conviction, but all were rejected.",
      "Known as \u201cthe Queen of Tejano,\u201d Selena rose to stardom and won a Grammy during a Tejano music boom in the early 1990s. Her hits included \u201cBidi Bidi Bom Bom,\u201d \u201cComo la Flor,\u201d \u201cAmor Prohibido,\u201d \u201cNo Me Queda Mas\u201d and \u201cTu Solo Tu.\u201d",

      "\u201cASCO: Without Permission\u201d is director Travis Guti\u00e9rrez Senger's latest documentary and executive produced by Gael Garcia Bernal and Diego Luna",
      "LOS ANGELES -- When filmmaker Travis Guti\u00e9rrez Senger reflects on ASCO\u2019s legacy, he quickly notes they were more than an art group; they created a movement, one with remarkable influence on Chicano art history.",
      "\u201cThat movement continues today, and it\u2019s very expansive,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of books, films and things that will be written about ASCO over a period of time. And this was our contribution in some ways.\u201d",
      "He's referring to \u201cASCO: Without Permission,\u201d a documentary that chronicles the story of the 1970s art group founded by multidisciplinary artist Patssi Valdez, muralist Willie Herr\u00f3n III, painter and performance artist Gronk and writer and photographer Harry Gamboa Jr. They met as teens, formed as young adults, and called their group \u201casco\u201d \u2014 \u201cnausea\u201d or \u201cdisgust\u201d in Spanish \u2014 after one of their early DIY exhibits. Their conceptual work and performance art spoke to the exclusion of Chicanos from the mainstream art world and the systemic police brutality endured by the Mexican American community in East Los Angeles.",
      "All four founding members of ASCO became some of the most notable Chicano artists, later exhibiting works in revered museums around the United States. But in their early days, the group was denied access to the notable galleries and museums. They created their own avenues in the form of public performances, murals and more to exhibit their work, their way.",
      "\u201cTo behave badly is the most ethical thing you can do,\u201d said executive producer Gael Garc\u00eda Bernal at the film\u2019s South by Southwest film festival premiere earlier this month. \u201cYou\u2019re building identity and questioning and unmasking the facade and the farce that exists.\u201d",
      "Bernal and Diego Luna executive produced the film under their production company El Corriente del Golfo. The film has yet to find distribution.",
      "Speaking with The Associated Press, Gamboa and Valdez praised Guti\u00e9rrez Senger\u2019s approach to their history. Both members, who appear in the documentary, saw the film for the first time with a crowd of fans and a group of young Chicano artists whose art was inspired by ASCO\u2019s early rebellion.",
      "\u201cI felt the film really kind of captured the essence of all of us working together,\u201d said Gamboa.",
      "Valdez says it was a special moment for her, as the only woman in the founding group, to be given equal time and understanding.",
      "\u201cFor the first time, I was given an equal voice in the group that hadn\u2019t happened before,\u201d she said, citing how previous stories of the group only highlighted her male collaborators.",
      "ASCO emerged at the height of the Chicano civil rights movement in the 1960s and 1970s. It was a time of heightened political and racial tension amid the East LA walkouts, protesting education inequality, and the Chicano Moratorium, an anti-Vietnam War movement during which many Mexican Americans were victims of police brutality.",
      "Muralists and collectives popped up as Latino artists sought to process the systemic injustice taking place in their communities.",
      "\u201cThe response to such violence was to create art,\u201d said Gamboa Jr. He wanted to alter the mainstream perception of Chicanos and present the possibilities and avenues someone can create despite societal constraints.",
      "For Valdez, being the only woman meant she was no stranger to a double dose of both racism in society and the sexism weaved within conservative Latino households, where young women were expected to keep quiet.",
      "\u201cI couldn\u2019t stand it. So, I was able to act out these forms of censorship through the performance work in ASCO,\u201d said Valdez who once taped herself to a public wall in a piece titled \u201cInstant Mural,\u201d a metaphor on feeling captive.",
      "One of ASCO's most known works is \u201cSpray Paint LACMA.\u201d Gamboa, Gronk and Herr\u00f3n spray painted their names on the side of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art after Gamboa says he was told by a curator, \u201cChicanos are in gangs, they don\u2019t make art.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere was another era when people said, \u2018Latinx art, you know, doesn\u2019t exist. It\u2019s not a thing. It doesn\u2019t belong. It\u2019s not part of American art,\u2019\u201d said Pilar Tompkins-Rivas, the chief curator and deputy director of the Lucas Museum of Narrative Art.",
      "ASCO\u2019s neighborhood performance art would often draw stares, and even crowds. In \u201cStation of the Cross,\u201d the group carried a large cross to the local military recruiting office to protest the Vietnam War.",
      "In 1974, Gamboa took a photo of Gronk posed as the victim of gang violence to bring attention to the media\u2019s sensationalist coverage of crime in East Los Angeles. In the documentary, Gamboa claims that a local news station ran the piece as an actual story.",
      "ASCO\u2019s work as a group remained in obscurity from the mainstream. It was not until 2011 when LACMA mounted \u201cASCO: Elite of the Obscure, A Retrospective, 1972-1887,\u201d the first retrospective to present the group\u2019s performance and conceptual art. On display was an image of Valdez, taken by Gamboa, standing above the graffiti art. Life had presented ASCO with its full-circle moment.",
      "\u201cLatino history has always been erased,\u201d said Guti\u00e9rrez Senger. \u201c\u2018ASCO: Without Permission\u2019 is a story of winning a battle, not a war.\u201d",
      "A 1974 photograph of Valdez shows the artist glammed up in a gold top, holding a golden statue of a cobra. She had won best actress at the Aztlan No Movie Awards \u2014 a fictional award show ASCO created as commentary on the lack of Latino representation in Hollywood.",
      "The group was inspired by Hollywood cinema and popular culture, but knew the likelihood of starring in studio films was limited, unless they wanted to play a maid, cartel leader or gang member.",
      "\u201cHollywood movies, rock \u2019n\u2019 roll. That\u2019s what I was about,\u201d said Valdez. \u201cAnd that\u2019s why I responded in the way I did with my artmaking.\u201d",
      "Gamboa photographed Herr\u00f3n, Gronk and Valdez using cinema stock to capture the essence of their favorite films. The series was called \u201cNo Movies\u201d and later inspired their satirical award show.",
      "Guti\u00e9rrez Senger was drawn to it and pays homage throughout the documentary by featuring a group of young Chicano artists \u2014 including local Los Angeles artists like Fabi Reyna and San Cha \u2014 in short films inspired by ASCO\u2019s signature DIY style.",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s a necessary obligation as a Latino if you\u2019re making films to fight very, very hard to put brown people on screen and behind the camera and to try to create films about our history,\u201d said Guti\u00e9rrez Senger. \u201cWe have rich stories, and we have a rich history.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "The Supreme Court will hear arguments in a South Carolina case over whether states can cut off Medicaid funding to Planned Parenthood",
      "WASHINGTON -- There are just two Planned Parenthood clinics in South Carolina, but every year they take hundreds of low-income patients who need things like contraception, cancer screenings and pregnancy testing.",
      "The organization has long been at the center of the debate over abortion, but its clinics across the U.S. also provide a range of other services. In South Carolina, Medicaid patients often seek out Planned Parenthood because they often have difficulty finding a doctor who accepts the publicly funded insurance.",
      "A case coming before the Supreme Court from South Carolina on Wednesday could upend that option. That's because the state's Republican governor, Henry McMaster, is pushing to block any public health care dollars from going to Planned Parenthood.",
      "Federal law already prohibits Medicaid money from going to pay for abortions, with very limited exceptions, and South Carolina now bans almost all abortions around six weeks after conception.",
      "\u201cThis case is not about abortion. This case is about general health care,\u201d said Katherine Farris, chief medical officer at Planned Parenthood South Atlantic.",
      "Still, Republican leaders in conservative-led states have long said that no public health care dollars should go to an organization that provides abortions, and states should instead be able to direct that money as they choose. A few states already have cut Medicaid funding to Planned Parenthood and more could follow if South Carolina prevails.",
      "\u201cThe people in this state do not want their tax money to go to that organization,\u201d McMaster said.",
      "The Trump administration is joining South Carolina for the arguments on Wednesday, which are playing out against the backdrop of a wider push by abortion opponents to defund Planned Parenthood.",
      "Health care advocates, meanwhile, say the effects of the case transcend abortion. The legal question at its center is whether Medicaid patients can sue over their legal right to choose their own qualified provider.",
      "The American Cancer Society and other public-health groups say in court papers that lawsuits are the only real way that patients can assert those rights. Losing the ability to go to court would hurt their access to care, especially in rural areas.",
      "\u201cIf no one is able to enforce the statute or no one\u2019s willing to enforce the statute at the federal level, then it\u2019s a right on paper only,\u201d said Julian Polaris, a lawyer who regularly advises state Medicaid programs and health care providers. States could also move to restrict access to treatments like gender-affirming care if the court sides with South Carolina, he said.",
      "One in five American women of reproductive age is now enrolled in the Medicaid program, said Heidi Allen, an associate professor at Columbia University. This means that finding providers who can offer quality family planning services \u2014 a requirement for Medicaid \u2014 is crucial for meeting the needs of those patients.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s concerning that states would eliminate a site of care for politically motivated reasons, \u201cAllen said.",
      "The case stretches back to 2018, before the Supreme Court overturned the nationwide right to abortion, when McMaster first moved to cut Planned Parenthood funding in a fulfillment of a campaign promise. He signed an executive order removing Planned Parenthood from a list of providers for things like birth control, and sexually transmitted disease testing.",
      "\u201cThere are plenty of good organizations that provide maternal health advice, counseling and care and we need more of those,\u201d McMaster said last week.",
      "His order was blocked in court, but since then judges have ruled in favor of similar moves in Texas and Missouri, said John Bursch, an attorney for the conservative group Alliance Defending Freedom.",
      "\u201cAt the highest level, this case is about whether states have the flexibility to direct Medicaid moneys to best benefit low-income women and families,\u201d he said.",
      "He acknowledged that a win for South Carolina could curtail other Medicaid lawsuits, but suggested that could be good for the program overall because it would mean less money going to legal fees. There is also an administrative appeals process available, he said.",
      "\u201cNo one is losing their access to health care clinics,\u201d Busch said. If the state is allowed to cut off Planned Parenthood, Medicaid patients could go to one of 200 other publicly funded health care clinics in the state, he said.",
      "In South Carolina, $90,000 in Medicaid funding goes to Planned Parenthood every year \u2014 a tiny fraction of a percentage point of the state\u2019s total Medicaid spending.",
      "Most counties in the state have already been federally designated as having too few primary care providers, said Amalia Luxardo, CEO of the South Carolina-based Women\u2019s Rights and Empowerment Network. Fourteen of the state\u2019s counties have no practicing OB-GYN physicians and five other counties have just one, she said, meaning many women already have to travel longer distances to find the right provider.",
      "Planned Parenthood has flexible hours and can get appointments scheduled quickly, factors that bring in patients from around the state, she said.",
      "\u201cWe are already in a health care crisis,\u201d said Luxardo, whose group has filed court briefs supporting Planned Parenthood. \u201cAnd when decisions like these negatively impact our constituents, the crisis is going to only increase.\u201d",

      "Two lines with hundreds of employees wrapped around the HHS headquarters building Tuesday morning. Workers waited in the chilly spring weather to be individually scanned in for access to the building. Some said they were waiting to find out if they still had jobs. Others gathered at local coffee shops and lunch spots after being turned away, finding out they had been eliminated after decades of service.",

      "MEXICO CITY -- A government-sponsored junk food ban in schools across Mexico took effect on Saturday, officials said, as the country tries to tackle one of the world\u2019s worst obesity and diabetes epidemics.",
      "The health guidelines, first published last fall, take a direct shot at salty and sweet processed products that have become a staple for generations of Mexican schoolchildren, such as sugary fruit drinks, packaged chips, artificial pork rinds and soy-encased, chili-flavored peanuts.",
      "Announcing that the ban had become law, Mexico's Education Ministry posted on X: \u201cFarewell, junk food!\u201d It encouraged parents to support the government's crusade by cooking healthy meals for their kids.",
      "\u201cOne of the core principles of the new Mexican school system is healthy living,\" said Mario Delgado, the public health secretary. \u201cThere's a high level of acceptance of this policy among parents.\u201d",

      "Under Mexico's new order, schools must phase out any food and beverage displaying even one black warning logo marking it as high in salt, sugar, calories and fat. Mexico implemented that compulsory front-of-package labeling system in 2020.",
      "Enforced from Monday morning, the start of the school week, the junk food ban also requires schools to serve more nutritious alternatives to junk food, like bean tacos, and offer plain drinking water.",
      "\u201cIt is much better to eat a bean taco than a bag of potato chips,\u201d said Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum, who has championed the ban.",
      "Mexico\u2019s children consume more junk food than anywhere else in Latin America, according to UNICEF, which classifies the nation\u2019s childhood obesity epidemic as an emergency. Sugary drinks and highly processed foods account for 40% of the total calories that children consume in a day, the agency reports.",

      "One-third of Mexican children are already considered overweight or obese, according to government statistics.",
      "School administrators found in violation of the order face stiff fines, ranging from $545 to $5,450.",
      "But enforcement poses a challenge in a country where previous junk food bans have struggled to gain traction and monitoring has been lax across Mexico\u2019s 255,000 schools, many of which lack water fountains \u2014 even reliable internet and electricity.",
      "It also wasn't immediately clear how the government would forbid the sale of junk food on sidewalks outside school campuses, where street vendors typically hawk candy, chips, nachos and ice cream to kids during recess and after the school day ends.",

      "A groundbreaking initiative could soon be bringing surgeons closer to patients in Africa's remote corners where the doctor-to-patients ratio is among the lowest in the world",
      "KOFORIDUA, Ghana -- Charles Owusu Aseku has traveled across Ghana and beyond in search of care for the large growth of tissue called a keloid on his neck since 2002. The 46-year-old was growing increasingly frustrated after two unsuccessful surgeries and a trip to South Africa that ended with just a consultation.",
      "Aseku was preparing for yet another medical trip until late February when he joined others in the first trial of 3D telemedicine technology in Ghana powered through computer screens in the back of a van.",
      "Those behind the initiative, developed by Microsoft\u2019s research team in partnership with local doctors and researchers, say the remote assessment will help provide medical consultations for patients awaiting surgery or after an operation, in a region where the doctor-to-patient ratio is among the lowest in the world.",
      "The project builds on earlier trials in Scotland and now works as a portable system with enhanced lighting and camera upgrades.",
      "Once inside the van, cameras will capture a 3D model of each patient and the image is then projected onto a large computer screen. Multiple doctors can join the consultation session online and manipulate the 3D model to assess the patient.",
      "\u201cThe idea behind the van is to allow it to travel to those remote villages that don\u2019t have specialized care ... to perform a pre or post-surgical consult,\u201d said Spencer Fowers, principal software developer and 3D-telemedicine project lead at Microsoft Research.",
      "The initiative also gives patients the opportunity to have multiple opinions. Aseku\u2019s session had doctors from Rwanda, Scotland and Brazil, an experience that he said gave him hope.",
      "\"I see a lot of doctors here and I am very happy because experience will come from each of them and maybe they will find a solution to my problem,\u201d the 46-year-old said.",
      "Researchers hope the trial at the Koforidua Regional Hospital, in Ghana\u2019s eastern region, is the start of a wider project that could expand the service and explore new use cases.",
      "Recent years have seen growing use of telemedicine, especially since the COVID-19 pandemic. Experts say such digital tools can benefit patients in Africa the most because there are so few specialist doctors for the continent's 1.4 billion people.",
      "George Opoku, 68, was referred to the Korle-Bu Teaching Hospital in the capital Accra \u2014 nearly 100 kilometers away from the Koforidua hospital, which is much closer to his home \u2014 where he had first gone to seek care for sarcoma, a rare form of cancer that develops in the bones and soft tissues.",
      "Upon hearing about the 3D telemedicine trial, his doctor decided to register him for the process, saving him the extra expenses and stress of long-distance travel.",
      "\u201cThis time I had to sit in a van and to introduce myself and condition to not only one doctor but several of them. I was able to answer all their questions and I am hopeful that they will discuss and cure me of my condition,\u201d Opku said. \u201cI feel well already and I am hopeful.\"",
      "A key challenge for the project is the lack of stable internet access, a common problem in remote parts of Africa.",
      "At the Korle-Bu Teaching Hospital, the technology is helping patients in need of plastic surgery. An inadequate number of plastic surgeons means that patients often have to consult with different doctors during each visit.",
      "Dr. Kwame Darko, consultant plastic surgeon at the hospital and one of the principal investigators on the project, said that 3D telemedicine could give patients the chance to be seen by multiple doctors during one session.",
      "The 3D technology could make a difference if replicated in Ghana and elsewhere, according to Dr. Ahensan Dasebre, chief resident doctor at the National Reconstructive Plastic Surgery and Burns Centre at Korle-Bu, who was not part of the project.",

      "Britain and Mauritius are finalizing a deal to transfer sovereignty over the Chagos Islands, a U.K. territory that is home to a major U.S. military base",
      "LONDON -- Britain and Mauritius are finalizing a deal to transfer sovereignty over the Chagos Islands, a disputed U.K. territory that is home to a major U.S. military base, the U.K. government said Tuesday.",
      "The government signaled that President Donald Trump\u2019s administration, which was consulted on the deal, has given its approval and no further action is needed from the U.S.",
      "\u201cWe are working with the Mauritian government to finalize and sign the treaty,\u201d said Tom Wells, a spokesman for Prime Minister Keir Starmer. \u201cOnce signed it will be laid before both houses of Parliament for scrutiny and for ratification.\u201d",
      "Britain and Mauritius have been negotiating a deal for the U.K. to hand over the Indian Ocean archipelago, which is home to a strategically important naval and bomber base on the largest of the islands, Diego Garcia. The U.K. would then lease back the base for at least 99 years.",
      "But the deal has faced criticism from the opposition Conservative Party and from some allies of Trump. Last year the now-Secretary of State Marco Rubio said it posed \u201ca serious threat\u201d to U.S. national security.",
      "Trump indicated during a visit to Washington by Starmer in February that he would support the deal, saying: \u201cI have a feeling it\u2019s going to work out very well.\u201d",
      "Britain split the islands away from Mauritius, a former British colony, in 1965, three years before Mauritius gained independence, and called the Chagos archipelago the British Indian Ocean Territory.",
      "In the 1960s and 1970s Britain evicted up to 2,000 people from the islands so the U.S. military could build the Diego Garcia base.",
      "Mauritius has long contested Britain\u2019s claim to the archipelago and in recent years the United Nations and its top court have urged Britain to return the Chagos to Mauritius.",
      "Britain agreed to do so in a draft deal in October, but that has been delayed by a change of government in Mauritius and reported quarrels over how much the U.K. should pay for the lease of the Diego Garcia air base.",
      "The Chagos islanders, many of whom relocated to Britain, say they were not consulted over the agreement. Under the draft deal, a resettlement fund would be created to help displaced islanders move back to the islands, apart from Diego Garcia. Details of any such measures remain unclear.",
      "Two Chagossian women  are seeking to take the U.K. government to court over the issue. Bernadette Dugasse and Bertrice Pompe, both British citizens, fear it will become even harder to go back to live where they were born once Mauritius takes control of the islands.",

      "He wears his suits like armor, smiles like a pop star and has more than 2 million followers on TikTok",
      "PARIS -- He wears his suits like armor, smiles like a pop star and boasts more than 2 million followers on TikTok. At just 29, Jordan Bardella has become the fresh-faced figurehead of France\u2019s National Rally party and is now poised to inherit one of the most electorally successful far-right machines in Europe.",
      "But behind the image of youthful confidence lies a question increasingly whispered by allies and adversaries alike: Can Bardella, who has no experience in government, really lead?",
      "The presidential ambitions of Bardella's mentor, Marine Le Pen, are likely over after a French court convicted her of embezzling European Union funds and barred her from holding office for five years. That means Bardella finds himself the last man standing atop the largest party in the French National Assembly. But having the spotlight doesn\u2019t mean he commands the stage.",
      "Critics call him Le Pen\u2019s puppet. Le Pen calls him her asset.",
      "On Monday night, she seemed to suggest the moment of reckoning might be approaching sooner than expected.",
      "\u201cI hope we won\u2019t have to use that asset sooner than necessary,\u201d she told the TF1 television network.",
      "Bardella was born in 1995 in the gritty suburb of Seine-Saint-Denis \u2014 a place more often in headlines for gang violence and poverty than political promise. He grew up in public housing, the son of Italian and Algerian heritage. His father ran a vending machine business. His family scraped together enough to send him to a semi-private Catholic school. He never finished university.",
      "But ambition moved faster than education. At 17, he joined the National Rally \u2014 then still known as the National Front, a party shunned by polite society and defined by the legacy of Jean-Marie Le Pen. For most, it was a dead end. For Bardella, it was a launchpad.",
      "By 23, he was a member of the European Parliament. By 26, Marine Le Pen had made him party president \u2014 the first person outside the Le Pen family to lead the far-right movement in its half-century history. It was a symbolic handover, but also a calculated move to modernize a brand long stained by racism and antisemitism.",
      "\u201cJordan Bardella is the creation of Marine Le Pen,\u201d said C\u00e9cile Alduy, a Stanford University professor and expert on the French far right. \u201cHe has been made by her and is extremely loyal.\u201d",
      "He quickly became the party\u2019s face: camera-ready, uncontroversial and fluent in the aesthetics of modern politics. While Le Pen kept hold of the ideological reins, Bardella toured the country as the youthful ambassador of a rebranded movement.",
      "Their alliance was once pitched as a kind of American-style ticket \u2014 she for president, he for prime minister. But that balance no longer holds. With Le Pen sidelined, Bardella is no longer the backup.",
      "The problem is, he was never meant to lead.",
      "Bardella has never held national office. He\u2019s never run a ministry. But he has built a following. With an outsized social media presence and a slick, stage-managed image, he has become a star among young voters, offering a set of politics that looks fresh, even when the message is familiar.",
      "His content is clean, curated and relentlessly on message. Campaign videos feature sharp suits, barbed quips at President Emmanuel Macron and selfie lines at rally stops. He doesn\u2019t improvise. He doesn\u2019t deviate.",
      "That discipline has helped broaden the National Rally\u2019s appeal, especially in the aftermath of Macron\u2019s defeat in the 2024 European elections. Bardella was the one who demanded Macron dissolve Parliament. When Macron agreed, Bardella\u2019s status shifted from party mascot to potential prime minister.",
      "Yet the more visible he becomes, the more his limitations show.",
      "Last week, Bardella traveled to Israel in a bid to bolster his image on the world stage. It backfired. Major Jewish organizations boycotted the event he attended. Israeli President Isaac Herzog stayed away. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu offered only a brief, formal handshake.",
      "The French press called the visit a reputational flop \u2014 a trip meant to signal international stature that ended up highlighting its absence. Bardella may wear the suit, but many say he hasn\u2019t yet grown into it.",
      "At home, his platform is standard fare for the far right: stricter immigration laws, fewer social benefits for noncitizens and limits on dual nationals holding sensitive public jobs. He\u2019s pledged lower energy taxes, a reversal of Macron\u2019s pension reform and a ban on mobile phones in high schools.",
      "Abroad, he\u2019s attempted to sound more statesmanlike, voicing support for arming Ukraine, labeling Russia a \u201cmultidimensional threat\u201d and calling for France to eventually exit NATO\u2019s integrated command, though not while war rages in Europe.",
      "It\u2019s a program designed to reassure nervous voters while keeping the movement\u2019s nationalist core intact.",
      "\u201cHe has a clean slate and comes with no baggage of the past,\u201d Alduy said.",
      "But the real question isn\u2019t about his past. It\u2019s whether he\u2019s ready for what comes next.",
      "For now, Bardella walks a fine line as the prot\u00e9g\u00e9 who was suddenly promoted, the frontman who's trying to become the act.",
      "His strength lies in presentation. The suit, the smile, the soundbites \u2014 they\u2019re all in place. His weakness is what lies behind that performance. That\u2019s still in question.",
      "The French press has criticized Bardella for failing to prepare his party for real power. National Rally figures have said his leadership has focused more on personal promotion than on collective progress, more about boosting his own image than caring about the party or building a serious governing force.",
      "Others have linked him to a lack of structure and professionalism inside the party. Projects he once promised \u2014 from recruiting outside talent to strengthening local networks \u2014 have stalled. Key voices say the party is too centralized, too top-down and too afraid to challenge its young leader.",
      "Whether Bardella becomes the future of French politics or just its most polished understudy will depend not on Marine Le Pen but on whether he can become more than her invention.",

      "The renewed investigation of a ranch in western Mexico where authorities say the Jalisco New Generation Cartel trained recruits has revealed some details about how one of the country\u2019s most powerful drug cartels operates",
      "MEXICO CITY -- The renewed investigation of a ranch in western Mexico, where authorities say the Jalisco New Generation Cartel trained recruits, has revealed some details about how one of the country\u2019s most powerful drug cartels operates.",
      "The cartel, which the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration says has some 19,000 in its ranks, developed rapidly into an extremely violent and capable force after it split from the Sinaloa cartel following the 2010 killing of Sinaloa cartel capo Ignacio \u201cNacho\u201d Coronel Villarreal by the military.",
      "The Jalisco cartel is led by Nemesio Rub\u00e9n \u201cel Mencho\u201d Oseguera Cervantes, for whom the U.S. government has offered a $15 million reward for information leading to his capture. Oseguera drew renewed attention this week after his image was projected as a band played at a music festival in Jalisco over the weekend.",
      "The Jalisco and Sinaloa cartels have battled for control of various parts of Mexico, including Mexico\u2019s southern border with Guatemala. Both are among six Mexican organized crime groups recently designated as Foreign Terrorist Organizations by the U.S. government.",
      "One of authorities\u2019 recent advances against Jalisco was the arrest of Jos\u00e9 Gregorio Lastra, allegedly in charge of the cartel\u2019s recruitment.",
      "The Jalisco cartel employs three recruiting methods: there are volunteers drawn by the pay and imagined lifestyle, which experts say make up the bulk of their number; there\u2019s targeted recruitment of ex-military and police forces, who because of their professional training enter the cartel as trainers and leaders of squads of gunmen. Finally, there's the kind of forced recruitment that investigators say happened at the Jalisco ranch.",
      "For that last category, authorities say the cartel uses social platforms \u2014 they\u2019ve identified at least 60 pages \u2014 to offer fake job opportunities, especially as security guards, with weekly salaries of $600, well above the average for such positions. Once they have the applicants, they force them to join the cartel.",
      "One recruit who reportedly survived the ranch has said that the cartel picked up recruits at bus stations under false pretenses and took them to the ranch where they were trained for a month in the use of weapons in addition to fitness training, Mexico\u2019s Public Security Secretary Omar Garc\u00eda Harfuch said. Those who refused or tried to escape were beaten, tortured and killed.",
      "Security analyst David Saucedo said Jalisco\u2019s structure is vertical, with Oseguera at the top.",
      "Last weekend, pictures of Oseguera were projected as a band started playing at a regional music festival in Jalisco. Some in the crowd cheered and on Monday President Claudia Sheinbaum, as well as Jalisco's governor, condemned the act. The Jalisco State Prosecutor's Office said it was opening an investigation. Such displays of respect for cartel leaders are not uncommon.",
      "Below Oseguera are regional commands, as well as areas responsible for drug production and sales, Saucedo said.",
      "The DEA says the cartel has a presence in 21 of Mexico\u2019s 32 states, exceeding the Sinaloa cartel\u2019s 19. Some analysts believe Jalisco is actually in as many as 25 states, including its home base in the state of the same name. It also maintains a presence in some 100 countries, according to the DEA.",
      "In less than two decades, Jalisco became one of Mexico\u2019s most powerful criminal organizations and even managed to take control of some traditional strongholds of the Sinaloa cartel. Sinaloa has been weakened more recently by infighting among its factions following arrests of key leaders, including Joaqu\u00edn \u201cEl Chapo\u201d Guzm\u00e1n, who is serving a life sentence in the U.S., and Ismael \u201cEl Mayo\u201d Zambada, who was arrested last July along with one of Guzm\u00e1n\u2019s sons and is awaiting trial in the U.S.",
      "Center for Research and Higher Studies in Social Anthropology researcher Carlos Flores said Jalisco\u2019s \u201ccapacity for violent action\u201d and style of \u201cirregular warfare\u201d aided its speedy rise, which coincided with the emergence of fentanyl as a highly profitable revenue stream.",
      "Saucedo says that Jalisco has also successfully allied itself with other criminal groups, allowing it to penetrate some territories with a sort of \u201cfranchise\u201d model as in the central state of Aguascalientes and the key border city of Tijuana.",
      "The case of the ranch also serves as an example of how the Jalisco cartel is able to operate with impunity in territory it controls thanks to the complicity of local authorities, Flores said.",
      "Despite being discovered in September 2024 and 10 people being arrested, the ranch\u2019s investigation stalled until family members searching for their relatives went there themselves in March and raised the alarm about hundreds of clothing items they found, as well as apparent bone fragments. Since then, authorities have detained three local police officers who were allegedly tied to disappearances at the ranch.",
      "\u201cThere are signs that show publicly how those kinds of deals have allowed the Jalisco cartel to establish itself in certain states, while they go about eliminating their rivals, sometimes with the help of public safety forces,\u201d Flores said.",

      "Maloyan was among an estimated 1.5 million people killed in the events, which are widely viewed by scholars at the first genocide of the 20th century.

      "A Jesuit priest says he will rather go to prison than pay a fine of 500 euros or $541 for participating in a climate activists\u2019 street blockade in the southern German city of Nuremberg",
      "BERLIN -- BERLIN (AP) \u2014 A Jesuit priest says he prefers going to prison than paying a 500-euro ($541) fine for participating in a climate activists' street blockade in the southern German city of Nuremberg.",
      "The Rev. J\u00f6rg Alt started serving his nearly monthlong prison sentence on Tuesday in Nuremberg.",
      "\u201cToday, I am starting my 25-day alternative custodial sentence in Nuremberg prison,\u201d he said before entering the prison. \u201cI don\u2019t like doing this, especially as my health is no longer the best at the age of 63. But I see no alternative, because it\u2019s the last form of protest I have left in this specific case to draw attention to important issues\u201d such as climate change.",
      "In November, Alt said that \"as a priest, I have no income and no bank account due to my vow of poverty and that I do not want to harm the order and my fellow brothers by paying my fine,\u201d German news agency dpa reported.",
      "His remarks came after a Bavarian Higher Regional Court rejected his appeal to a lower court's decision and confirmed Alt's conviction for coercion for participating in a sit-in blockade.",
      "After the court's decision, authorities repeatedly asked Alt to pay the 500 euros, before the fine was eventually commuted to the 25-day prison sentence.",
      "The court ruling in November was in connection with a street blockade in August 2022, when the Jesuit priest and about 40 other activists blocked traffic in Nuremberg by gluing their hands to a street in front of the city's train station to draw attention to climate change.",
      "Numerous similar protests have taken place across Germany and other countries in recent years, as activists try to draw attention to the urgency of tackling climate change. The public and political response to such road blockades has been mixed.",
      "While some Germans have said they support the protesters\u2019 cause, if not their means, activists have also faced violence from enraged motorists and calls for tough punishment from conservative politicians.",
      "German Chancellor Olaf Scholz has sharply criticized climate activists as \u201c nutty\u201d for drastic protests such as blocking streets or gluing themselves to famous paintings in museums.",
      "Last year, activists belonging to one of the main protest groups, the Last Generation, announced that they would abandon the tactic and move on to holding what they call \u201cdisobedient assemblies.\u201d",
      "Alt has said that he had also decided to serve the prison sentence instead of paying the fine \"in solidarity with those climate activists who are treated similarly by the administration and the judiciary \u2014 it may all be lawful, but it is unjust.\u201d",
      "It's not the first time, that Alt was convicted for his activism. In May 2023, a court also convicted him of coercion after he participated in a road blockade in Munich and ordered him to pay a small fine.",

      "Scientists at the world\u2019s largest atom smasher have released a blueprint for a much bigger successor that could help solve enigmas of physics, starting in the mid-2040s at a cost of about $16 billion",
      "GENEVA -- Scientists at the world's largest atom smasher have released a blueprint for a much bigger successor that could help solve remaining enigmas of physics.",
      "The plans for the Future Circular Collider \u2014 a nearly 91-kilometer (56.5-mile) loop along the French-Swiss border and even below Lake Geneva \u2014 published late on Monday put the finishing details on a project roughly a decade in the making at CERN, the European Organization for Nuclear Research.",
      "The study lays out features like the proposed path, environmental impact, scientific ambitions and cost of the project. Independent experts will take a look before CERN's two-dozen member countries \u2014 all European except for Israel \u2014 decide in 2028 whether to go forward, starting in the mid-2040s at a cost of some 14 billion Swiss francs (about $16 billion).",
      "CERN officials have touted the promise of scientific discoveries that could drive innovation in areas like cryogenics, superconducting magnets and vacuum technologies that could benefit humankind. Outside experts pointed to the promise of learning more about the Higgs boson, the elusive particle that helped explain how matter formed after the Big Bang",
      "\u201cThis set of reports represents an important milestone in the process, but a full sense of the likelihood of it being brought to fruition will only be known through careful studies by scientists, engineers and others, including politicians who must make difficult decisions at time when uncertainty rules the day,\u201d said Dave Toback, a professor of physics and astronomy at Texas A&M University, in an e-mail.",
      "The new collider \u201cprovides and exciting opportunity for the particle physics community, and indeed all of physics, on the world stage,\u201d said Toback, who was not affiliated with the study, and who worked for years at the Fermilab Tevatron collider in the United States that was shut down in 2011.",
      "For roughly a decade, top minds at CERN have been cooking up plans for a successor to the Large Hadron Collider, a network of magnets that accelerate particles through a 27-kilometer (17-mile) underground tunnel and slams them together at velocities approaching the speed of light.",
      "Work at the particle collider confirmed in 2013 the existence of the Higgs boson \u2014 the central piece in a puzzle known as the standard model that helps explains some fundamental forces in the universe.",
      "CERN scientists, engineers and partners behind the study considered at least 100 different scenarios for the new collider before coming up with the proposed 91-kilometer circumference at an average depth of 200 meters (656 feet). The tunnel would be about 5 meters (16 feet) in diameter, CERN said.",
      "\u201cUltimately what we would like to do is a collider which will come up with ten times more energy than what we have today,\" said Arnaud Marsollier, a CERN spokesman. \u201cWhen you have more energy, then you can create particles that are heavier.\u201d",
      "A bigger collider would also offer greater precision to help plumb particularities of the Higgs boson, which \u201cwe have kind of a blurry image of\u201d now, he added.",

But after his impeachment, pro-Yoon rallies have grown sharply, with many conservatives fed up with what they call the Democratic Party\u2019s excessive offensive on the already embattled Yoon administration.",
      "Yoon was released from prison March 8, after a Seoul district court cancelled his arrest and allowed him to stand his criminal trial without being detained. Ten top military and police officials have also been arrested and indicted over their roles in the martial law enactment.",

      "As a young woman, she studied law, became a defense attorney and learned how to argue her way through hostile rooms. In politics, she didn\u2019t wait her turn. In 2011, she wrested control of the party from her father. In 2015, she expelled him after one of his Holocaust-denying tirades.",
      "She renamed the party the National Rally. She replaced leather-jacketed radicals with tailored blazers and talking points. She talked less about race, more about the French way of life. She warned of \u201ccivilizational threats,\u201d called for bans on headscarves and promised to put French families first.",
      "Her tone changed. Her message didn\u2019t.",
      "In one of her sharpest political maneuvers, she sought out a group long despised by her father: the LGBTQ community. Le Pen filled her inner circle with openly gay aides, skipped public protests against same-sex marriage and framed herself as a protector of sexual minorities against \u201cIslamist danger.\u201d",
      "Critics called it \u201cpinkwashing\u201d \u2014 a cosmetic tolerance masking deeper hostility. But it worked. A surprising number of gay voters, especially younger ones, started backing her. Many saw strength, clarity and the promise of order in a world spinning too fast.",
      "She ran for president three times: 2012, 2017 and 2022. Each time, she climbed higher. In her final campaign, she was confident, calm and media savvy. She leaned into her role as a single mother, posed with her cats and repeated her calls for \u201cnational priority.\u201d She no longer shocked. She convinced.",
      "Behind her stood a constellation of far-right leaders cheering her on: Hungary\u2019s Viktor Orb\u00e1n, Matteo Salvini and Giorgia Meloni in Italy, the Netherlands\u2019 Geert Wilders. They saw in her not only an ally, but a leader. Her mix of cultural nationalism, social media fluency and calculated restraint became a blueprint.",
      "\u201cMarine Le Pen posts pictures of her cat, talks about being a mother. But when it comes to policy, there\u2019s no softening,\u201d said Pierre Lefevre, a Paris-based consultant. \u201cIt makes extreme positions seem more palatable, even to people who might otherwise be put off.\u201d",
      "When Le Pen lost in 2022, she didn\u2019t vanish. She regrouped, stayed present in parliament and prepared for 2027. Polls had her leading. Macron cannot run again.",
      "Then came Monday's verdict.",
      "The court found that Le Pen had siphoned off millions of euros in public funds while serving in the European Parliament, paying party staff with money intended for EU assistants. Prosecutors described it as deliberate and organized. The court agreed.",
      "She was sentenced to two years of house arrest, fined \u20ac100,000 ($108,200) and banned from holding public office for five years. She said she would appeal. The house arrest sentence will be suspended during the appeal, but the ban on holding office takes effect immediately.",
      "Her allies erupted in outrage. Orb\u00e1n declared, \u201cJe suis Marine\u201d \u2014 I am Marine. Salvini called the ruling \u201ca declaration of war by Brussels.\u201d Meloni lamented it was \u201cdepriving millions of citizens of their representation.\u201d U.S. President Donald Trump decried it as \"a very big deal... it sounds like this country.\u201d In Paris, her supporters called it political persecution. Her opponents fist-pumped in the streets.",
      "Even in disgrace, Le Pen remains one of the most consequential political figures of her time. She took a name that once evoked hatred and transformed it into a serious vehicle for national leadership. She made the far right electable. She blurred the line between fringe and power.",
      "Her party, the National Rally, became the largest last year in France\u2019s lower house of parliament. Her handpicked successor, 29-year-old Jordan Bardella, now leads it. He is polished and popular, but he lacks broad political experience and name recognition.",
      "Whether Le Pen returns after her ban, fades into silence or reinvents herself again, her mark is permanent. She forced mainstream rivals to adapt to her language. She turned fear into votes and redefined what was politically possible in a republic once seen as immune to extremism.",
      "She never became president, but she changed the race and the rules.",

      "BEIRUT -- A 12-year-old boy was among four people killed on Monday in Syria \u2019s Tartous province, a coastal region home to a majority Alawite population, provincial officials said in a statement.",
      "The attackers, who remain unidentified and at large, opened fire in Haref Nemra, a village in the Baniyas countryside in Tartous. The Tartous province\u2019s general security forces are pursuing those involved \u201cto bring them to justice,\u201d said Amer al-Madani, Baniyas\u2019 head of security, who spoke in a video posted on the province\u2019s official Facebook page.",
      "Kamal, a resident of a nearby village and a relative of three victims who asked to be identified only by his first name out of fear of reprisals, said the masked gunmen, whom he believed to be government security forces, arrived at the village seeking the mukhtar, a local leader who represents the community in administrative matters, before opening fire, killing at least four people, including a 12-year-old and an 80-year-old from the same family.",
      "Kamal said he was citing accounts from three other witnesses. The sequence of events has not been independently verified, and there is no official statement on the details of the attack.",
      "Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) is the Islamist group whose leader, Ahmad al-Sharaa, played a key role in the overthrow of former President Bashar al-Assad and is now Syria\u2019s de facto president.",
      "The attack forced dozens of families to flee from the Baniyas area, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a British-based war monitor. Kamal also said many in Baniyas escaped to nearby mountains. \u201cNo one here feels safe,\u201d he said. \u201cAll main roads are empty most times because people are scared to go outside.\u201d",
      "Separately on Monday, two unidentified gunmen killed six people in Homs, a city in western Syria known for its religious diversity, with a majority of Sunni Muslims and a significant Alawite minority, a sect of Shia Islam primarily based in Syria.",
      "The attack took place in the Karm al-Zeitoun neighborhood, claiming the lives of three children and their mother, who all belonged to the Alawite sect, as well as two house guests from the Sunni community. The attack also left the father seriously wounded. There has been no official comment on the incident from the government or relevant authorities.",
      "Syria\u2019s Alawite community in Syria has faced escalating violence, with reports of massacres and targeted attacks.",
      "In early March, Islamist-led forces killed over 1,000 Alawites in coordinated assaults on coastal areas including Latakia and Baniyas, carrying out executions and burning homes, leading to mass displacements.",
      "The attacks, among the deadliest in Syria\u2019s modern history, saw militants rampage through Alawite-populated coastal provinces and nearby Hama and Homs, killing civilians\u2014including entire families\u2014in homes and on the streets. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported nearly 200 deaths in Baniyas alone.",
      "Witnesses identified the attackers as hardline Sunni Islamists, including Syria-based jihadi foreign fighters and former members of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, the disbanded insurgent group that led the December Assad ousting. However, many were also local Sunnis, seeking revenge for past atrocities blamed on Alawites loyal to Assad.",
      "While some Sunnis hold the Alawite community responsible for Assad\u2019s brutal crackdowns, Alawites themselves say they also suffered under his rule. The international community has urged Syria\u2019s new government to protect minorities and prevent further violence.",

      "Lehder became the first Colombian drug trafficker extradited to the United States after he was arrested during a party at his ranch.",
      "The former drug trafficker was extradited to the U.S. in 1987, where he served more than 30 years in prison. In 2020, Lehder was released after serving two-thirds of his U.S. sentence. He was deported to Germany, where he is also a citizen.",

      "TOKYO -- An independent investigation of a sexual assault case linked to one of Japan\u2019s top celebrities said Monday that Fuji Television Network failed to support its female employee, adding that management lacked human rights awareness.",
      "The report centers on Masahiro Nakai, a former leader of Japan\u2019s once-popular boy band SMAP, and how Fuji Television handled the 2023 case in which Nakai allegedly sexually assaulted a Fuji announcer at a dinner at his home. He later reached a settlement with the woman.",
      "The allegations surfaced in December and triggered claims of systematic cover-ups by Fuji TV executives. Public outrage led to advertising losses at Fuji, one of the networks where Nakai worked. Top management of the company have resigned. Nakai in January announced his retirement.",
      "The report by a lawyer-led panel is the first outside investigation into the case, and concluded that Nakai sexually assaulted the woman.",
      "Fuji TV\u2019s initial internal investigation denied any wrongdoing at the company. Former Fuji TV president Koichi Minato in January apologized but said he prioritized the woman\u2019s confidentiality and her mental condition.",
      "The new report said Fuji TV's neglect of the case resulted from its culture of routinely having young female employees entertain male clients and celebrities.",
      "Fuji TV failed to provide necessary care for the woman and did not report to a compliance office despite her consultations with supervisors and two doctors who examined her, the report said, noting the network management's \u201clow levels of understanding of sexual violence and human rights awareness.\"",
      "Executives who handled the case were all men and viewed it as trouble in a private relationship and continued to allow Nakai to appear on Fuji TV shows. They recommended a corporate lawyer for Nakai to consult on the case, the report said.",
      "\u201cIt was a wrong and inconsiderate move that only added to her suffering,\u201d said Akira Takeuchi, a main lawyer with the investigation team.",
      "Takeuchi also said surveys of employees indicated \u201crampant\u201d sexual harassment at the company.",
      "The woman, in a statement released through her lawyer to Japanese media, said she felt \u201crelieved\u201d by the findings of the report after seeing \u201cgroundless accusations and criticism\u201d against her on social media. Women who speak out about sexual abuse in Japan often draw criticism rather than sympathy.",
      "\u201cThe damages I suffered will never fade for the rest of my life and what I lost will never come back,\u201d she wrote. \u201cI sincerely hope cases like this will be eliminated not only from the media and entertainment industry, but from all of society.\u201d",
      "Fuji TV President Kenji Shimizu later Monday offered an apology to the woman, saying that \u201cwe are so sorry to have caused tremendous pain to the victim because of the company's inadequate relief measures.\u201d",
      "He said he is now aware of the company's \u201cheavy responsibility.\" He said he hoped to contact the victim's lawyer to discuss ways to directly offer redress to the woman.",

      "The Food and Drug Administration\u2019s chief tobacco regulator has been forced out",
      "WASHINGTON -- The Food and Drug Administration\u2019s chief tobacco regulator has been removed from his post amid sweeping cuts at the agency and across the federal health workforce handed down Tuesday, according to people familiar with the matter.",
      "In an email to staff, FDA tobacco director Brian King said: \u201cIt is with a heavy heart and profound disappointment that I share I have been placed on administrative leave.\u201d",
      "King was removed from his position and offered reassignment to the Indian Health Service, according to a person familiar with the matter who did not have permission to discuss the matter publicly and spoke on the condition of anonymity.",
      "Dozens of staffers in FDA\u2019s tobacco center also received notices of dismissal Tuesday morning, including the entire office responsible for enforcing tobacco regulations.",
      "King, who joined the agency in 2022, has been vigorously criticized by vaping lobbyists for ordering thousands of companies to remove their fruit and candy-flavored e-cigarettes from the market. During his time at FDA, teen vaping has fallen to a 10-year low.",
      "His removal comes just days after FDA vaccine chief Dr. Peter Marks was forced out, citing health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s support for vaccine \u201cmisinformation and lies\u201d in his resignation letter.",
      "The latest changes mean that nearly all of FDA\u2019s top leaders overseeing drugs, food, vaccines, medical devices and now tobacco products have resigned or retired in recent months.",
      "The leadership vacuum comes as Kennedy moves to fire 3,500 FDA staffers and pushes ahead with plans to scrutinize ultra-processed foods, childhood vaccines, antidepressants and other long-established products.",
      "The wave of departures means incoming FDA commissioner Marty Makary \u2014 who was confirmed last week\u2014 will inherit an agency without many of its top experts and a beleaguered workforce that has been rocked by weeks of layoffs and a chaotic return-to-office process. Only a handful of FDA employees are political appointees, with nearly all of the agency's scientific reviews and decisions overseen by career officials.",
      "Neither Makary nor Kennedy have said much about how tobacco policy fits into their plan to \u201cMake America Healthy Again.\u201d Despite historically low rates of smoking, tobacco-related diseases remain the nation\u2019s leading preventable cause of death, blamed for more than 490,000 annually.",

      "Politicians, parents and anti-tobacco groups want the FDA to do more to stamp out unauthorized vaping products that can appeal to teens, many of which are imported from China. Tobacco and vaping companies say the FDA has been too slow to approve newer products for adult smokers \u2014 including e-cigarettes \u2014 that generally carry much lower risks than traditional cigarettes.",
      "Under King, the FDA rejected applications for millions of flavored e-cigarettes, citing insufficient data that the products would help adult smokers while not becoming popular with underage kids. Those rejections have resulted in multiple lawsuits against FDA from vape makers, including one that was argued before the Supreme Court in December.",
      "The Vapor Technology Association, an industry group, has been running ads urging Trump to follow through on a campaign pledge he made to \u201csave the flavored vaping industry.\u201d",

      "A federal judge has declined to block the use of Georgia\u2019s electronic voting system in a long-running lawsuit that alleged that the system is vulnerable to attack and has operational issues that could deprive voters of their constitutional rights",
      "ATLANTA -- A federal judge has declined to block the use of Georgia's electronic voting system in a long-running lawsuit that alleged that the system is vulnerable to attack and has operational issues that could deprive voters of their constitutional rights.",
      "U.S. District Judge Amy Totenberg found that the activists and individual voters who challenged the state's voting system did not prove that the problems they identified prevented them from voting, diluted their votes or kept their votes from being counted. She wrote in a ruling Monday that they lack standing to sue and she is unable to consider the merits of their claims.",
      "Georgia election officials have consistently said the system is secure and reliable and that it is up to the state to decide how it conducts elections.",
      "The ruling follows several years of intense focus on Georgia's elections in the aftermath of President Donald Trump's narrow loss in the state to Democrat Joe Biden in the 2020 presidential election. Trump claimed without evidence that election fraud cost him victory, and his allies spread wild conspiracy theories about the Dominion Voting Systems machines used in Georgia.",
      "But the lawsuit at issue long precedes those claims. It was originally filed in 2017 by several individual voters and the Coalition for Good Governance, which advocates for election integrity, and targeted the outdated, paperless voting system used at the time. After Georgia purchased a new voting system in 2019, the suit was amended to target that system.",
      "The election system used statewide by nearly all in-person voters includes touch screen voting machines that print ballots with a human-readable summary of voters\u2019 selections and a QR code that a scanner reads to count the votes. The human-readable summary only lists the voter's choice, not the names of other candidates or the details of a ballot question.",
      "The activists and voters who filed the lawsuit argued that since people can't read a QR code, they are unable to ensure that what the scanners are reading accurately reflects their selections. They also asserted that it is burdensome for voters to have to check their selections twice \u2014 once on the voting machine screen and again using the limited information on the printed ballot.",
      "They asked Totenberg to stop the state from using the touch screen voting machine system as the standard method for in-person voting.",
      "\u201cAlthough Plaintiffs have not ultimately prevailed on their legal claims, their work has identified substantial concerns about the administration, maintenance, and security of Georgia\u2019s electronic in-person voting system,\u201d Totenberg wrote. \u201cThese investigative and educational efforts have prompted meaningful legislative action to bolster the transparency and accountability of Georgia's voting systems.\u201d",
      "In addition to other changes, a law passed by Georgia lawmakers last year requires QR codes to be removed from ballots by July 2026, though she noted that funding and government action would be required to implement that change.",
      "The judge outlined the evidence presented at trial in early 2024, including the findings of University of Michigan computer scientist and professor J. Alex Halderman. He testified that an attacker could potentially alter the QR codes to change voter selections, install malware on the voting machines and obtain county-wide passwords, among other issues, she wrote.",
      "A report Halderman wrote in 2021 as part of this lawsuit prompted the federal Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency in 2022 to put out advisory recommending steps that should be taken by election officials in places that use the voting machines that Georgia uses. Georgia election officials in 2023 said they planned to wait until after the 2024 election to install a software update to address some of the security flaws, saying they had taken other measures to protect the state's voting system.",
      "Totenberg's ruling puts an end to a long and twisting path. Throughout the process she has repeatedly raised concerns about the state's voting system and practices and, early on, accused state officials of ignoring problems. In an August 2019 ruling, she prohibited the state from using its antiquated paperless voting machines beyond that year. The state had agreed to purchase new voting machines from Dominion a few weeks earlier and scrambled to deploy them ahead of the 2020 election cycle.",
      "Conspiracy theorists and people looking to give credence to Trump's claims of a stolen election have seized on Totenberg's intermediate rulings in the case, as well as on Halderman's findings. But Halderman has always made clear that his mission was to identify vulnerabilities in the system, that he was not tasked with looking for and had not found any evidence that those weaknesses had been exploited.",

      "Ishiba told reporters he is willing to fly to Washington to negotiate directly with Trump. The U.S. will begin collecting 25% tariffs on auto imports on Thursday, with taxes on fully-imported cars kicking in at midnight, U.S. time. The tariffs are set to expand to applicable auto parts in weeks to come.",

      "Rusting pipes in a barren field and unpaid workers are what remain after a U.S. company promised to turn a huge piece of land in Senegal \u2014 about twice the size of Paris \u2014 into an agricultural project and create thousands of jobs",
      "DAKAR, Senegal -- Rusting pipes in a barren field and unpaid workers are what remain after a U.S. company promised to turn a huge piece of land in Senegal \u2014 about twice the size of Paris \u2014 into an agricultural project and create thousands of jobs.",
      "In interviews with company officials and residents, The Associated Press explored one of the growing number of foreign investment projects targeting Africa, home to about 60% of the world\u2019s remaining uncultivated arable land. Like this one, many fail, often far from public notice.",
      "Internal company documents seen by the AP show how the plans, endorsed by the Senegalese government, for exporting animal feed to wealthy Gulf nations fell apart.",
      "At first glance, the landscape of stark acacia trees on the edge of the Sahara Desert doesn\u2019t hold much agricultural promise. But in an age of climate change, foreign investors are looking at this and other African landscapes.",
      "The continent has seen a third of the world's large-scale land acquisitions between 2000 and 2020, mostly for agriculture, according to researchers from the International Institute of Social Studies in the Netherlands.",
      "But 23% of those deals have failed, after sometimes ambitious plans to feed the world.",
      "In 2021, the Senegalese village of Ni\u00e9ti Yone welcomed investors Frank Timis and Gora Seck from a U.S.-registered company, African Agriculture. Over cups of sweet green tea, the visitors promised to employ hundreds of locals and, one day, thousands.",
      "Timis, originally from Romania, was the majority stakeholder. His companies have mined for gold, minerals and fossil fuels across West Africa.",
      "Seck, a Senegalese mining investor, chaired an Italian company whose biofuel plans for the land parcel had failed. It sold the 50-year lease for 20,000 hectares to Timis for $7.9 million. Seck came on as president of African Agriculture's Senegalese subsidiary and holds 4.8% of its shares.",
      "Now the company wanted the community's approval.",
      "The land was next to Senegal\u2019s largest freshwater lake, for which the company obtained water rights. African Agriculture planned to grow alfalfa and export it to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. Both traditionally buy alfalfa from the U.S., but the amount of land in alfalfa production there has dropped by 38% in the last 20 years, largely due to drought caused by climate change, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.",
      "The proposal divided the community of subsistence farmers. Herders who had raised livestock on the land for generations opposed it. Others, like Doudou Ndiaye Mboup, thought it could help ease Senegal's unemployment crisis.",
      "\u201cI bought their dream. I saw thousands of young Africans with jobs and prosperity,\u201d said Mboup, who was later employed as an electrician and now leads a union of employees.",
      "Despite the formation of an opposition group called the Ndiael Collective, African Agriculture moved ahead, hiring about 70 of the community\u2019s 10,000 residents.",
      "After planting a 300-hectare (740-acre) pilot plot of alfalfa, the company announced in November 2022 it would go public to raise funds.",
      "African Agriculture valued the company at $450 million. The Oakland Institute, an environmental think tank in the U.S., questioned that amount and called the deal bad for food security as well as greenhouse gas emissions.",
      "The company went public in December 2023, with shares trading at $8 on the NASDAQ exchange. It raised $22.6 million during the offering but had to pay $19 million to the listed but inactive company it had merged with.",
      "That payment signaled trouble to investors. It showed that the other company, 0X Capital Venture Acquisition Corp. II, didn't want to hold its 98% of stock. And it highlighted the way African Agriculture had used the merger to bypass the vetting process needed for listing.",
      "One year later, shares in African Agriculture were worth almost nothing.",
      "Now, security guards patrol the land's barbed-wire perimeter, blocking herders and farmers from using it. The company has been delisted.",
      "Mboup said he and others haven\u2019t been paid for six months. The workers took the company to employment court in Senegal to claim about $180,000 in unpaid wages. In February, they burned tires outside the company's office. Mboup later said an agreement was reached for back wages to be paid in June.",
      "\u201cI took out loans to build a house and now I can\u2019t pay it back,\u201d said Mboup, who had been making $200 a month, just above average for Senegal. \u201cI\u2019ve sold my motorbike and sheep to feed my children and send them to school, but many are not so lucky.\u201d",
      "Timis didn't respond to questions. Seck told the AP he was no longer affiliated with African Agriculture. Current CEO Mike Rhodes said he had been advised to not comment.",
      "Herders and farmers are furious and have urged Senegal's government to let them use the land. But that rarely happens. In a study of 63 such foreign deals, the International Institute of Social Studies found only 11% of land was returned to the community. In most cases, the land is offered to other investors.",
      "\u201cWe want to work with the government to rectify this situation. If not, we will fight,\" warned Bayal Sow, the area\u2019s deputy mayor.",
      "The Senegalese minister of agriculture, food sovereignty and herding, Mabouba Diagne, did not respond to questions. The African Agriculture deal occurred under the previous administration.",
      "The failed project has undermined community trust, said herder Adama Sow, 74: \u201cBefore, we lived in peace, but now there\u2019s conflict for those of us who supported them.\"",
      "Meanwhile, African Agriculture's former CEO has moved on to a bigger land deal elsewhere on the continent \u2014 with experts raising questions again.",
      "In August, South African Alan Kessler announced his new company, African Food Security, partnering with a Cameroonian, Baba Danpullo. It has announced a project roughly 30 times the size of the one in Senegal, with 635,000 hectares in Congo and Cameroon.",
      "The new company seeks $875 million in investment. The company\u2019s investor prospectus, obtained by the AP, says it plans to register in Abu Dhabi.",
      "In an interview with the AP in January, Kessler blamed the failure of the Senegal project on the way African Agriculture's public offering was structured. He said there were no plans for a public offering this time.",
      "He claimed his new company's project would double corn production in these countries, and described African Food Security as the \u201cmost incredibly important development company on the planet.\u201d He said they have started to grow corn on 200 hectares in Cameroon.",
      "Experts who looked over the prospectus raised concerns about its claims, including an unusually high projection for corn yields. Kessler rejected those concerns.",
      "\u201cWhen he was CEO of African Agriculture, Kessler also made lofty claims about food production, job creation, exports and investment returns that did not pan out,\u201d said Ren\u00e9e Vellv\u00e9, co-founder of GRAIN, a Spain-based nonprofit for land rights.",
      "Hype without proof was a key strategy for African Agriculture, said its former chief operating officer, Javier Orellana, who said he is owed 165,000 euros ($178,000) in unpaid salary after leaving the company in 2023.",
      "He told the AP he had been suspicious of the company\u2019s $450 million valuation.",
      "\u201cI know the agriculture industry well and ($450 million) didn\u2019t add up,\u201d Orellana said, adding he stayed on because the company gave him what he called a very attractive offer.",
      "In the end, a share in African Agriculture is now worth less than a penny.",
      "\u201cWe are looking forward to going back to Senegal,\u201d Kessler said. \"We were appreciated there. We\u2019ve been welcomed back there.\u201d",

      "HONG KONG -- The United States sanctioned six Chinese and Hong Kong officials who it alleged were involved in \u201ctransnational repression\u201d and acts that threaten to further erode the city's autonomy, with China threatening to take countermeasures.",
      "The six officials included Justice Secretary Paul Lam, security office director Dong Jingwei and police commissioner Raymond Siu.",
      "The sanctions are expected to further escalate tensions between Washington and Beijing, who are already locked in friction over trade tariffs and other issues like Taiwan.",
      "\u201cBeijing and Hong Kong officials have used Hong Kong national security laws extraterritorially to intimidate, silence, and harass 19 pro-democracy activists who were forced to flee overseas, including a U.S. citizen and four other U.S. residents,\u201d the U.S. State Department said.",
      "The statement dated Monday said the six officials sanctioned were linked to entities or actions that engaged in coercing, arresting, detaining or imprisoning individuals under the authority of the city's security law, or implementing the law.",
      "The other three affected officials were Sonny Au, the secretary-general for the city's committee for safeguarding national security, and Dick Wong and Margaret Chiu, both assistant commissioners of the police.",
      "Since Beijing imposed a national security law in 2020 to quell the 2019 massive anti-government protests, Hong Kong authorities have prosecuted many leading activists in the former British colony, which returned to Chinese rule in 1997.",
      "The crackdown has drawn criticism from foreign governments, especially because the city was promised that its Western-style civil liberties and semi-autonomy would be kept intact for at least 50 years during the 1997 handover. Beijing and Hong Kong governments insist the law is necessary for the city\u2019s stability.",
      "Over the past two years, Hong Kong authorities have issued arrest warrants for 19 activists based overseas, with bounties of $1 million Hong Kong dollars ($128,536) for information leading to each of their arrests. The affected activists included former pro-democracy lawmakers Nathan Law and Ted Hui. They also canceled the passports of some of the overseas-based activists under a new security law introduced to the city last year.",
      "The Hong Kong office of China's foreign ministry condemned the sanctions, saying they again exposed the ill-intention of the U.S. to undermine the city's prosperity and contain China's development. It urged Washington to stop interfering in the city's affairs.",
      "\u201cChina will surely take effective countermeasures against these despicable acts by the U.S.!\u201d it said in a statement.",
      "In Beijing, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun said China would take resolute countermeasures for any wrong actions by the U.S. He argued the actions taken by Hong Kong police against \u201canti-China elements\u201d who fled abroad were carried out according to the law and that the U.S. has no right to interfere with the city's national security cases.",
      "The Hong Kong government strongly condemned the U.S. for the sanctions, saying it despises them and is not intimidated by them.",
      "\u201cIt, once again, clearly exposed the U.S.\u2019 barbarity under its hegemony, which is exactly the same as its recent tactics in bullying and coercing various countries and regions,\u201d it said in a statement.",
      "It said the \u201cabsconders\u201d mentioned by the U.S. government are wanted for arrest because they continued to blatantly engage in activities endangering national security overseas. It said the U.S. has given cover for those \u201cwho have committed these evil deeds,\" and therefore it was necessary for the city to take lawful measures to combat the acts.",
      "\u201cThe imposition of the so-called \u2018sanctions\u2019 in the guise of defending human rights and democracy indeed constitute a demonstration of shameless hypocrisy with double standards on the part of the U.S.,\u201d it said.",
      "Lam, the justice secretary, said the sanctions do not affect him. \u201cThey do not affect my work; they do not affect my life.\u201d",
      "He said the sanctions represented \u201cblatant tyrannical bullying intended to deter people from participating in safeguarding national security\" in a statement.",
      "But Frances Hui, one of the overseas-based activists targeted by the authorities, wrote on X that it was a critical step in addressing the city's worsening crackdown. She said they hoped it marked the beginning of a sustained effort to hold perpetrators accountable.",
      "The latest U.S. sanctions were not the first related to the city. During Donald Trump's first presidential term, his government also imposed sanctions on Hong Kong and Chinese officials for undermining Hong Kong\u2019s autonomy.",
      "In 2021, the U.S. slapped more sanctions on officials over Beijing\u2019s crackdown on political freedoms in the semi-autonomous city under former U.S. President Joe Biden administration.",

      "The Tennessee Valley Authority has promoted one of its top executives to CEO as President Donald Trump has begun turning his attention back to the nation's largest public utility",
      "NASHVILLE, Tenn. -- The nation's largest public utility on Monday promoted one of its top executives to CEO, putting Don Moul in charge of the Tennessee Valley Authority as President Donald Trump has cast renewed attention on the federal entity.",
      "The utility announced that its board picked Moul as president and chief executive to replace Jeff Lyash, who said in January that he would retire no later than September. The move comes less than a week after Trump removed one of the utility's board members without indicating why. With the firing of Michelle Moore, an appointee of former President Joe Biden, the board currently has five members and four vacancies.",
      "The board firing and CEO hiring come after Tennessee's two Republican U.S. senators urged officials to opt for \u201can interim CEO trusted by the president\u201d before hiring someone long-term.",
      "Moul has served as TVA's executive vice president and chief operating officer since June 2021. In a news release announcing his selection, TVA focused in part on Moul's leadership in the advancement of nuclear energy technologies and his experience as a licensed senior reactor operator. He starts in the new role on April 9.",
      "\u201cTVA needs a steady hand right now,\" Moul said in the news release. \"I will build on the momentum that Jeff and our team have created -\u2013 making sure we continue to invest in new generation, strengthen our grid and enhance system reliability.\u201d",
      "Earlier this month, U.S. Sens. Marsha Blackburn and Bill Hagerty wrote a guest column arguing that the TVA board was bogging down a project that seeks to build a small modular reactor with studies and hurdles.",
      "Blackburn and Hagerty also said that hiring a CEO from within would forgo the chance to recruit a \u201ctop-quality leader\u201d from outside the utility, which provides power to 10 million people across seven Southern states.",
      "In part, advocates for nuclear energy have called for its expansion to help meet the demand from companies to power their artificial intelligence technologies, and do so without carbon emissions that speed up climate change.",
      "Stephen Smith, executive director of the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy, called the op-ed by Blackburn and Hagerty \u201creckless interference.\u201d He said they don't understand the \u201crisk of rushing nuclear technology before it\u2019s ready for prime time both economically and safety-wise.\u201d",
      "Clean energy advocates have also criticized TVA's decision to replace several of its aging coal plants with another fossil fuel, natural gas.",
      "Trump put TVA and the outgoing CEO Lyash on the hot seat in his first term.",
      "In 2020, Trump fired the former TVA board chairman and another board member and drove TVA to reverse course on the hiring of foreign labor for information technology jobs.",
      "He also called for Lyash\u2019s replacement and the position\u2019s pay to be capped at $500,000.",
      "In response, TVA has noted that the CEO pay ranks in the bottom quartile of the power industry. Lyash\u2019s total compensation topped $10.5 million in the 2024 budget year, including various pension and performance incentives worth millions of dollars. Additionally, the utility has stressed that it doesn\u2019t receive federal taxpayer money and instead is funded by electricity customers.",
      "A TVA spokesperson has said Lyash's retirement was not related to the administration or current politics and that Lyash had begun talking to TVA board members last fall about considering retirement.",

      "Real estate, high-yield bonds, and cryptocurrency don\u2019t always live up to their reputation as portfolio diversifiers",
      "Diversification is a core principle of sound investing: A portfolio that includes assets with different performance characteristics often leads to better risk-adjusted returns than one that relies on a single asset class.",
      "But building a diversified portfolio can be easier in theory than practice, as many asset classes often touted as good portfolio diversifiers may not live up to their reputation.",
      "In some past periods, real estate investment trusts didn\u2019t move closely in tandem with the broader US equity market.",
      "Rolling three-year correlations have dropped as low as 0.10 during some periods, such as the early 2000s. And being untethered to the overall equity market can lead to better risk-adjusted returns when real estate is added to a diversified portfolio.",
      "In recent years, however, real estate has generally moved more in line with stocks overall. This has also made it a less valuable cushion against bear-market declines.",
      "Real estate had previously held up better than the overall market during some market corrections, such as the tech-stock correction that started in early 2000. But during the three most recent bear markets, real estate suffered heavier-than-average losses.",
      "High-yield bonds (also known as junk bonds) are issued by corporations with below-average credit ratings, generally defined as BB+ or lower from a major credit rating agency.",
      "As a result, they tend to trade more in line with broad credit markets, overall economic trends, and company-specific factors than they do with Treasuries. As a result, they\u2019re less sensitive to interest-rate movements than investment-grade bonds, which means they can provide diversification benefits within the bond portion of a portfolio.",
      "At the same time, though, high-yield bonds have a relatively high correlation with stocks. They typically suffer during periods of weaker economic growth, which are also negative for stocks.",
      "Granted, high-yield bonds have historically provided some protection from market drawdowns. However, Treasuries have done a much better job of cushioning downside risk.",
      "As an asset that exists purely in digital form, cryptocurrency is fundamentally different from other major asset classes.",
      "Bitcoin still accounts for most of the investor interest and assets, but numerous digital currencies have also attracted more attention from both retail and institutional investors over the past couple of years.",
      "As a nontraditional asset, cryptocurrency has had an extremely low correlation with most other major asset classes.But there are two reasons crypto may not make the best portfolio diversifier.",
      "First, as digital assets have attracted more interest from mainstream investors, correlations have steadily trended up in recent years.",
      "Second, crypto\u2019s potential diversification value has been overshadowed by its extreme performance swings. Instead of acting like a noncorrelated asset, digital assets are mainly defined by their extreme volatility. Over the past three years, bitcoin has been nearly 4 times as volatile as stocks. Much of this volatility has been on the upside, but bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have also been subject to extreme drawdown risk.",
      "The three examples discussed above underscore two of the limitations of correlation metrics. First, correlations can change over time, meaning that assets that were once great diversifiers may no longer be so. And second, even assets that still have a relatively low correlation coefficient may still be subject to above-average downside risk.",

      "President Donald Trump is taking a blowtorch to the rules that have governed world trade for decades",
      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump is taking a blowtorch to the rules that have governed world trade for decades. The \u201creciprocal\u2019\u2019 tariffs that he is expected to announce Wednesday are likely to create chaos for global businesses and conflict with America\u2019s allies and adversaries alike.",
      "Since the 1960s, tariffs \u2014 or import taxes \u2014 have emerged from negotiations between dozens of countries. Trump wants to seize the process.",
      "\u201cObviously, it disrupts the way that things have been done for a very long time,\u2019\u2019 said Richard Mojica, a trade attorney at Miller & Chevalier. \u201cTrump is throwing that out the window ... Clearly this is ripping up trade. There are going to have to be adjustments all over the place.\u2019\u2019",
      "Pointing to America\u2019s massive and persistent trade deficits \u2013 not since 1975 has the U.S. sold the rest of the world more than it\u2019s bought -- Trump charges that the playing field is tilted against U.S. companies. A big reason for that, he and his advisers say, is because other countries usually tax American exports at a higher rate than America taxes theirs.",
      "Trump has a fix: He\u2019s raising U.S. tariffs to match what other countries charge.",
      "And he's expected to roll out his reciprocal tariffs \u2014 possibly along with unknown details about other import taxes \u2014 on Wednesday April 2. He's taken to calling the date \"Liberation Day'' because his protectionist policies aim to free the U.S. economy from dependence on foreign goods.",
      "The president is an unabashed tariff supporter. He used them liberally in his first term and is deploying them even more aggressively in his second. Since returning to the White House, he has slapped 20% tariffs on China, unveiled a 25% tax on imported cars and trucks set to take effect Thursday, effectively raised U.S. taxes on foreign steel and aluminum and imposed levies on some goods from Canada and Mexico, which he may expand this week.",
      "Economists don't share Trump's enthusiasm for tariffs. They're a tax on importers that usually get passed on to consumers. But it's possible that Trump's reciprocal tariff threat could bring other countries to the table and get them to lower their own import taxes.",
      "\u201cIt could be win-win,\u201d said Christine McDaniel, a former U.S. trade official now at George Mason University\u2019s Mercatus Center. \u201cIt\u2019s in other countries\u2019 interests to reduce those tariffs.\u201d",
      "She noted that India has already cut tariffs on items from motorcycles to luxury cars and agreed to ramp up purchases of U.S. energy.",
      "They sound simple: The United States would raise its tariff on foreign goods to match what other countries impose on U.S. products.",
      "\u201cIf they charge us, we charge them,\u2019\u2019 the president said in February. \u201cIf they\u2019re at 25, we\u2019re at 25. If they\u2019re at 10, we\u2019re at 10. And if they\u2019re much higher than 25, that\u2019s what we are too.\u2019\u2019",
      "But the White House didn\u2019t reveal many details. It has directed Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick to deliver a report this week about how the new tariffs would actually work.",
      "Among the outstanding questions, noted Antonio Rivera, a partner at ArentFox Schiff and a former attorney with U.S. Customs and Border Protection, is whether the U.S. is going to look at the thousands of items in the tariff code \u2013 from motorcycles to mangos -- and try to level the tariff rates out one by one, country by country. Or whether it will look more broadly at each country\u2019s average tariff and how it compares to America. Or something else entirely.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s just a very, very chaotic environment,\u201d said Stephen Lamar, president and CEO of the American Apparel & Footwear Association. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to plan in any sort of long-term, sustainable way.\u2019\u2019",
      "America\u2019s tariffs are generally lower than those of its trading partners. After World War II, the United States pushed for other countries to lower trade barriers and tariffs, seeing free trade as a way to promote peace, prosperity and American exports around the world. And it mostly practiced what it preached, generally keeping its own tariffs low and giving American consumers access to inexpensive foreign goods.",
      "Trump has broken with the old free trade consensus, saying unfair foreign competition has hurt American manufacturers and devastated factory towns in the American heartland. During his first term, he slapped tariffs on foreign steel, aluminum, washing machines, solar panels and almost everything from China. Democratic President Joe Biden largely continued Trump\u2019s protectionist policies.",
      "The White House has cited several examples of especially lopsided tariffs: Brazil taxes ethanol imports, including America\u2019s, at 18%, but the U.S. tariff on ethanol is just 2.5%. Likewise, India taxes foreign motorcycles at 100%, America just 2.4%.",
      "The higher foreign tariffs that Trump complains about weren\u2019t sneakily adopted by foreign countries. The United States agreed to them after years of complex negotiations known as the Uruguay Round, which ended in a trade pact involving 123 countries.",
      "As part of the deal, the countries could set their own tariffs on different products \u2013 but under the \u201cmost favored nation\u2019\u2019 approach, they couldn\u2019t charge one country more than they charged another. So the high tariffs Trump complains about aren\u2019t aimed at the United States alone. They hit everybody.",
      "Trump\u2019s grievances against U.S. trading partners also come at an odd time. The United States, running on strong consumer spending and healthy improvements in productivity, is outperforming the world\u2019s other advanced economies. The U.S. economy grew nearly 9% from just before COVID-19 hit through the middle of last year \u2014 compared with just 5.5% for Canada and just 1.9% for the European Union. Germany's economy shrank 2% during that time.",
      "Not satisfied with scrambling the tariff code, Trump is also going after other foreign practices he sees as unfair barriers to American exports. These include subsidies that give homegrown producers an advantage over U.S. exports; ostensible health rules that are used to keep out foreign products; and loose regulations that encourage the theft of trade secrets and other intellectual property.",
      "Figuring out an import tax that offsets the damage from those practices will add another level of complexity to Trump\u2019s reciprocal tariff scheme.",
      "The Trump team is also picking a fight with the European Union and other trading partners over so-called value-added taxes. Known as VATs, these levies are essentially a sales tax on products that are consumed within a country\u2019s borders. Trump and his advisers consider VATs a tariff because they apply to U.S. exports.",
      "Yet most economists disagree, for a simple reason: VATs are applied to domestic and imported products alike, so they don't specifically target foreign goods and haven't traditionally been seen as a trade barrier.",
      "And there\u2019s a bigger problem: VATs are huge revenue raisers for European governments. \u201cThere is no way most countries can negotiate over their VAT ... as it is a critical part of their revenue base,\u2019\u2019 Brad Setser, senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, posted on X.",
      "Paul Ashworth, chief North America economist for Capital Economics, says that the top 15 countries that export to the U.S. have average VATs topping 14%, as well as duties of 6%. That would mean U.S. retaliatory tariffs could reach 20% \u2014 much higher than Trump's campaign proposal of universal 10% duties.",
      "Trump and some of his advisers argue that steeper tariffs would help reverse the United States' long-standing trade deficits.",
      "But tariffs haven't proven successful at narrowing the trade gap: Despite the Trump-Biden import taxes, the deficit rose last year to $918 billion, second-highest on record.",
      "The deficit, economists say, is a result of the unique features of the U.S. economy. Because the federal government runs a huge deficit, and American consumers like to spend so much, U.S. consumption and investment far outpaces savings. As a result, a chunk of that demand goes to overseas goods and services.",
      "The U.S. covers the cost of the trade gap by essentially borrowing from overseas, in part by selling treasury securities and other assets.",
      "\u201cThe trade deficit is really a macroeconomic imbalance,\" said Kimberly Clausing, a UCLA economist and former Treasury official. \u201cIt comes from this lack of desire to save and this lack of desire to tax. Until you fix those things, we\u2019ll run a trade imbalance.\u201d",

      "The latest season of \u201cLove Is Blind\u201d featured a ton of popular music in its soundtrack",
      "NEW YORK -- When a couple decided to take their relationship further on the most recent season of \u201cLove Is Blind,\u201d the moment was soundtracked with a familiar song: Billie Eilish\u2019s \u201cBirds of a Feather.\u201d",
      "It wasn\u2019t a flash-in-the-pan musical surprise. The season was stacked with familiar needle drops \u2014 Miley Cyrus\u2019 \u201cWrecking Ball,\u201d Justin Bieber\u2019s \u201cHoly,\u201d Ariana Grande\u2019s \u201cInto You,\u201d Selena Gomez\u2019s \u201cLose You to Love Me\u201d \u2014 a gesture away from the little-known, sometimes generic pop songs that used to meet the show's most emotional moments.",
      "Show creator and Kinetic Content CEO Chris Coelen attributed the pivot to the show's anniversary.",
      "\u201cWe decided, in this Season 8, to coincide with our fifth anniversary, to really embrace popular music in a big way,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd so, we ended up using \u2014 throughout the entire season and in every episode \u2014 we used popular music cues.\u201d",
      "\u201cLove Is Blind\u201d isn\u2019t the only reality show that walks the line between what viewers have labeled \u201creal songs\u201d and unfamiliar music.",
      "It\u2019s not artificial intelligence, where \u201cnobody controls the copyright,\u201d says \u201cThe Bachelor\u201d music supervisor Jody Friedman. \u201cThere\u2019s too much risk involved with using AI music in these projects.\u201d",
      "Excluding big-time pop records, the music used on television comes from a number of sources. It can be custom, original music by the show\u2019s composers. It can be licensed directly from artists, or from sync agents, production music libraries or a \u201cone stop,\u201d what supervisors call a company that has the rights to license both the master recording and the composition rights.",
      "Music supervisors might also turn to covers of well-known songs. On the most recent season of \u201cThe Bachelor,\u201d Friedman used a cover of Phil Phillips\u2019 \u201cSea of Love,\u201d a classic \u201950s tune. It\u2019s more affordable to pay to license a cover than the original recording \u2014 \u201cand creatively, it\u2019s a modern take on an old song,\u201d he says.",
      "\u201cLove Island USA\u201d music supervisor Sara Torres also uses covers.",
      "\u201cThat can bring in other listeners that may not necessarily be into pop, but if they hear the song in a different genre, it might pull them in, to go back and listen to the original version,\u201d she says.",
      "Music libraries \u2014 companies that represent music catalogs for licensing purposes \u2014 are key, too, because if a song is too expensive to license, a supervisor can instead find a song that evokes the feeling of BTS\u2019 \u201cButter\u201d without having to pay for it.",
      "\u201cThe indie libraries, let\u2019s say, for TV, could be anywhere from $1,000-1,500 per needle drop use,\u201d says Friedman. For TV shows in general, bigger commercial songs can range from $20,000 to upward of $100,000, with high-profile songs earning more depending on the use, he says.",
      "The use of instantly recognizable pop music differs from program to program.",
      "\u201cLove Is Blind\u201d has used popular music in the past, but sparingly. Coelen points out the use of Lee Ann Womack\u2019s \u201cI Hope You Dance\u201d in Bliss Poureetezadi and Zack Goytowski\u2019s story in Season 4. But the frequency of Top 40 hits in the most recent season is new.",
      "He says the benefit of using these songs, creatively, is that it \u201celevates the experience,\u201d for the viewer: \u201cEmotions are so connected to certain pieces of music, and they can conjure up feelings that we relate to.\u201d",
      "Kinetic Content declined The Associated Press\u2019 request to speak with the show\u2019s music supervisor, Jon Ernst.",
      "\u201cLove Island USA\u201d featured songs like Chappell Roan\u2019s \u201cKaleidoscope\u201d and Sabrina Carpenter\u2019s \u201cPlease Please Please\u201d in its most recent season. Executive producer James Barker points out that the original U.K. show has always used commercial music, and therefore the U.S. version has endeavored to do the same.",
      "\u201cThe show is meant to feel like you\u2019re on vacation with your best friends. Of course, when you\u2019re on vacation, you\u2019re sharing music,\u201d he says. \u201cI think that translates into how we create the show.\u201d",
      "Torres agrees. She adds that the show typically uses more commercial music in the beginning of the season, and then again in the finale \u2014 \u201cyou want that big impact.\u201d",
      "Because the show has a quick turnaround time, with six episodes a week \u2014 \u201cwhatever happens in Fiji on Monday airs Tuesday in America,\u201d as Barker describes it \u2014 the show team \u201cpre-clears\u201d over a thousand songs, just in case they work for a particular narrative moment. That means requests are sent out to publishers and labels ahead of time, but they're not paid for until the tracks are selected.",
      "A show with more lead time, \u201cThe Bachelor\u201d has long used commercial songs in its programming. This year's season, the show's 29th, had several memorable musical moments, including a Cardi B, Bad Bunny and J Balvin needle drop when \u201cI Like It\u201d played as the cast made their way to Madrid.",
      "\u201cThis is my first season with \u2018The Bachelor,\u2019 but historically they\u2019ve used Colbie Caillat, Boyz II Men, Backstreet Boys,\u201d lists Friedman. \u201cThey used Billie Eilish last season. This season we used a David Guetta track, Dropkick Murphys for the episode in Boston. There\u2019s a Karol G track.\u201d",
      "He adds \u201cThe Bachelor\u201d does use a lot of recognizable pop songs, typically one or two per episode.",
      "\u201cEach episode does have a budget. So, while they may splurge on a pop song, the rest of the budget\u201d is spent on other music that comes at a lower cost, he says.",
      "For \u201cLove Is Blind,\u201d Coelen says simply: \u201cThe answer is yes.\u201d",
      "Barker from \u201cLove Island USA\u201d agrees.",
      "\u201cNot only are you engaged with the characters, but the songs and artists that you care about listening to at home are being represented on television,\u201d he adds. \u201cIt\u2019s just a bridge between us all.\u201d",

      "BANGKOK -- Thai authorities said Monday they are investigating why a single office tower under construction in Bangkok collapsed during an earthquake Friday that otherwise caused limited damage in the capital.",

      "But in the longer run it's important to ensure building safety in the city, which has millions of people living and working in thousands of high-rise buildings. The magnitude 7.7 quake centered more than 800 miles (1,200 kilometers) away killed more than 1,700 people in Myanmar and at least 18 in Thailand, most at the Bangkok construction site near the popular Chatuchak Market.",
      "\u201cWhat's important in the long-term and medium-term, I think we need to find the root cause so at least we can learn some lessons and improve building regulations,\" he said. \u201cIn the end, we will have some results that will improve safety in Bangkok.\u201d",
      "Shares in the property developer handling the project, Italian Thai Development, sank 27% on Monday as questions were raised about the high-rise's design, enforcement of construction safety codes, and the state-run Chinese contractor building the structure, the State Audit Office building.",

      "Although it does not sit near a geologic fault, Bangkok is built on relatively unstable alluvial soil, on the banks of the Chao Phraya River. The city has long been sinking under the weight of its many tall buildings, leading authorities to restrict the use of groundwater to help reduce subsidence.",
      "The Myanmar quake Friday gave the city an unusually long and strong jolt, causing water from rooftop pools to cascade down skyscrapers, light-rail trains to rock on their tracks, and millions of people to flee homes and apartment buildings. Many people waited for hours to see if their homes and offices were safe.",
      "Most other damage in the city appeared to be superficial, such as fallen ceiling panels and fittings and cracked plaster.",

      "There is plenty of nostalgia at Black Mountain, New Hampshire's oldest ski area",
      "JACKSON, N.H. -- A skier since age 4, Thomas Brennick now enjoys regular trips to New Hampshire\u2019s Black Mountain with his two grandchildren.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s back to the old days,\u201d he said from the Summit Double chairlift on a recent sunny Friday. \u201cIt's just good, old-time skiing at its best.\u201d",
      "Behind the scenes, the experience is now propelled by a high-tech system designed to increase efficiency at the state\u2019s oldest ski area. And while small, independent resorts can\u2019t compete on infrastructure or buying power with conglomerates like Vail, which owns nearby Attitash Mountain Resort and seven others in the Northeast alone, at least one entrepreneur is betting technology will be \u201ca really great equalizer.\u201d",
      "That businessman is Erik Mogensen, who bought Black Mountain last year and turned it into a lab for his ski mountain consultancy, Entabeni Systems. The company builds systems that put lift tickets sales, lesson reservations and equipment rentals online while collecting detailed data to inform decisions such as where to make more snow and how much.",
      "\u201cA lot of general managers will go out and look at how many rows of cars are parked, and that\u2019s kind of how they tell how busy they are,\u201d Mogensen said. \u201cWe really want to look at that transactional data down to the deepest level.\u201d",
      "That includes analyzing everything from the most popular time to sell hot dogs in the lodge to how many runs a season pass holder makes per visit.",
      "\u201cThe large operators, they can do a lot of things at scale that we can\u2019t. They can buy 20 snow cats at a time, 10 chairlifts, those types of things. We can\u2019t do that, but we\u2019re really nimble,\u201d Mogensen said. \u201cWe can decide to change the way we groom very quickly, or change the way we open trails, or change our (food and beverage) menu in the middle of a day.\u201d",
      "Mogensen, who says his happiest moments are tied to skiing, started Entabeni Systems in 2015, driven by the desire to keep the sport accessible. In 2023, he bought the company Indy Pass, which allows buyers to ski for two days each at 230 independent ski areas, including Black Mountain. It's an alternative to the Epic and Ikon multi-resort passes offered by the Vail and Alterra conglomerates.",
      "Black Mountain was an early participant in Indy Pass. When Mogensen learned it was in danger of closing, he was reminded of his hometown's long-gone ski area. He bought Black Mountain aiming to ultimately transform it into a cooperative.",
      "Many Indy Pass resorts also are clients of Entabeni Systems, including Utah's Beaver Mountain, which bills itself as the longest continuously-run family owned mountain resort in the U.S.",
      "Kristy Seeholzer, whose husband\u2019s grandfather founded Beaver Mountain, said Entabeni streamlined its ticketing and season pass system. That led to new, lower-priced passes for those willing to forgo skiing during holiday weeks or weekends, she said.",
      "\u201cA lot of our season pass holders were self-limiting anyway. They only want to ski weekdays because they don\u2019t want to deal with weekends,\u201d she said. \u201cWe could never have kept track of that manually.\"",
      "Though she is pleased overall, Seeholzer said the software can be challenging and slow.",
      "\u201cThere are some really great programs out there, like on the retail side of things or the sales side of things. And one of the things that was a little frustrating was it felt like we were reinventing the wheel,\u201d she said.",
      "Sam Shirley, 25, grew up skiing in New Hampshire and worked as a ski instructor and ski school director in Maine while attending college. But he said increasing technology has drastically changed the way he skis, pushing him to switch mostly to cross-country.",
      "\u201cAs a customer, it\u2019s made things more complicated,\u201d he said. \"It just becomes an extra hassle.\u201d",
      "Shirley used to enjoy spur-of-the-moment trips around New England, but has been put off by ski areas reserving lower rates for those who buy tickets ahead. He doesn\u2019t like having to provide detailed contact information, sometimes even a photograph, just to get a lift ticket.",
      "It's not just independent ski areas that are focused on technology and data. Many others are using lift tickets and passes embedded with radio frequency identification chips that track skiers' movements.",
      "Vail resorts pings cell phones to better understand how lift lines are forming, which informs staffing decisions, said John Plack, director of communications. Lift wait times have decreased each year for the past three years, with 97% under 10 minutes this year, he said.",
      "\u201cOur company is a wildly data-driven company. We know a lot about our guest set. We know their tastes. We know what they like to ski, we know when they like to ski. And we\u2019re able to use that data to really improve the guest experience,\u201d he said.",
      "That improvement comes at a cost. A one-day lift ticket at Vail's Keystone Resort in Colorado sold for $292 last week. A season pass cost $418, a potentially good deal for diehard skiers, but also a reliable revenue stream guaranteeing Vail a certain amount of income even as ski areas face less snow and shorter winters.",
      "The revenue from such passes, especially the multi-resort Epic Pass, allowed the company to invest $100 million in snowmaking, Plack said.",
      "\u201cBy committing to the season ahead of time, that gives us certainty and allows us to reinvest in our resorts,\" he said.",
      "Mogensen insists bigger isn\u2019t always better, however. Lift tickets at Black Mountain cost $59 to $99 per day and a season's pass is about $450.",
      "\u201cYou don\u2019t just come skiing to turn left and right. You come skiing because of the way the hot chocolate tastes and the way the fire pit smells and what spring skiing is and what the beer tastes like and who you\u2019re around,\u201d he said. \u201cSkiing doesn\u2019t have to be a luxury good. It can be a community center.\u201d",
      "Brennick, the Black Mountain lift rider who was skiing with his grandchildren, said he has noticed a difference since the ski area was sold.",
      "\u201cI can see the change,\u201d he said. \u201cThey're making a lot of snow and it shows.\u201d",

      "NEW YORK -- Detroit's Isaiah Stewart was suspended for two games and four other players from the Pistons and Minnesota Timberwolves drew one-game suspensions for their roles in an on-court altercation between the teams earlier this week, the NBA said Tuesday.",
      "Stewart got two games \u201cbased in part on his repeated history of unsportsmanlike acts,\u201d the league said.",
      "The NBA handed the one-game bans to Detroit's Ron Holland II and Marcus Sasser along with Minnesota's Naz Reid and Donte DiVincenzo. All five of those players were ejected from Sunday's game, as were Detroit coach J.B. Bickerstaff and Minnesota assistant Pablo Prigioni.",
      "\u201cObviously things went too far,\u201d Bickerstaff said after that game. \u201cBut what you see is guys looking out for one another, guys trying to protect one another, guys trying to have each other\u2019s backs. ... Those are nonnegotiables in our locker room.\u201d",
      "The incident began when Holland fouled Reid with 8:36 left in the second quarter of the Timberwolves\u2019 123-104 victory over the Pistons in Minneapolis. Reid confronted Holland, who then pushed DiVincenzo, who then shoved Holland \u2014 and they wound up falling into spectators seated along the baseline.",
      "Stewart and Sasser then entered the altercation, \u201cwhich resulted in a continued escalation of the situation,\u201d the league said.",
      "Reid and DiVincenzo will serve their one-game suspensions Tuesday when the Timberwolves visit Denver. Stewart will begin serving his suspension Wednesday when the Pistons visit Oklahoma City, and Holland and Sasser also will serve their suspensions in that game.",

      "The future of the \u201ctush push\u201d should be decided on Tuesday following debates about the safety of a play that\u2019s helped the Philadelphia Eagles win one Super Bowl and reach another",
      "PALM BEACH, Fla. -- The future of the \u201ctush push\u201d should be decided on Tuesday following debates about the safety of a play that\u2019s helped the Philadelphia Eagles win one Super Bowl and reach another.",
      "NFL owners are set to vote on Green Bay\u2019s proposal to ban the play along with other potential rules changes, including playoff seeding and kickoffs.",
      "Even though the league has said there haven\u2019t been any injuries reported as a result of the \u201ctush push,\u201d the potential risk involved in Philadelphia\u2019s version of the quarterback sneak has sparked intense discussions.",
      "The Packers, who lost to the Eagles in a wild-card playoff game, also cited pace of a play as a reason to consider eliminating the play. Rams coach Sean McVay is against it. Los Angeles also lost to Philadelphia in the playoffs. Bills coach Sean McDermott is leading the push to get rid of it even though Buffalo used it more than any team other than the Eagles.",
      "It\u2019ll take 24 of 32 votes to approve the ban.",
      "\u201cI feel where I\u2019m most concerned is, even though there is not significant data out there to this point, my biggest concern is the health and safety of the players, first and foremost,\u201d McDermott said at the league meetings on Monday. \u201cIt\u2019s two things. It\u2019s force, added force, No. 1, and then the posture of the players, being asked to execute that type of play, that\u2019s where my concern comes in. ... I\u2019m not a doctor. I\u2019m not going to get too deep into that situation there, in terms of how much data, how much sample. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s really always the best way to go. There is other data out there that suggests when you\u2019re in a posture like we\u2019re talking about, that can lead to serious injury. I think being responsible and proactive in that regard is the right way to go.\u201d",
      "The Eagles began using the play in short-yardage situations in 2022. Two or three players line up behind quarterback Jalen Hurts and push him forward. Several other teams, including the Bills, began using it but no team has matched Philadelphia\u2019s success rate.",
      "\u201cTough play to stop but then you\u2019re listening to that and the medical side and you probably could go either way with it,\u201d said Chiefs coach Andy Reid, whose team lost 40-22 to the Eagles in the Super Bowl. \u201cBut I would say if it\u2019s putting a player in a bad position, then you probably have to do something about it. But if it\u2019s not, it\u2019s a heck of a play.\u201d",
      "Other changes include making the dynamic kickoff rule permanent and overhauling the playoff format.",
      "The NFL competition committee has recommended sticking with the kickoff rule that was redesigned last year and tweaking it to move touchbacks to the 35-yard line in hopes of generating even more returns.",
      "The Detroit Lions proposed that playoff seeding should be based on record instead of automatically placing division winners in the top four spots.",
      "The committee also proposed an expansion of instant replay to allow replay assist to consult on-field officials to overrule objective calls such as facemask penalties, whether there was forcible contact to the head or neck area, horse-collar tackles or tripping if there was \u201cclear and obvious\u201d evidence that a foul didn\u2019t occur. Replay would also be able to overturn a roughing the kicker or running into the kicker penalty if video replay showed the defender made contact with the ball.",

      "It's coming. It's inevitable.",
      "This year's Celtics \u2014 the defending NBA champions \u2014 will go into the playoffs having set league records for 3-pointers made and 3-pointers attempted in a season.",
      "Everybody knows the Celtics shoot a ton of 3-pointers; they have taken at least 50 3s in a game 36 times this season \u2014 and they're a whopping 29-7 in those games after trying 62 of them in a win over Memphis on Monday night.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s just a matter of taking what the defense gives you,\u201d Celtics coach Joe Mazzulla said.",
      "Boston is now the first team in NBA history to take 60 3s in a game five times in the same season. They're up to 1,344 made 3s this season, now just 19 away from matching the record Golden State set two seasons ago \u2014 so that's within realistic reach against the Heat on Wednesday. They've tried 3,636 3s this season, 85 away from the record Houston set in 2018-19.",
      "This has been a talking point in the league for years. How many 3s are too many 3s?",
      "The Celtics don\u2019t care. Evidently, neither do about half of the other teams in the NBA.",
      "Boston is one of 15 clubs poised this season to break franchise records in either 3-pointers made, 3-pointers attempted, or both. Some teams \u2014 Chicago, Cleveland, Portland and San Antonio \u2014 have already set one or both of those club records with two weeks left in the season.",
      "Let's take a look inside the numbers:",
      "Now past 30,000 made 3s for the fourth consecutive season \u2014 James Harden made the 30,000th on Sunday \u2014 the NBA is on pace to smash the current total records for 3-pointers made and attempted in a season.",
      "The league record of 31,579 made 3s was set last season and the record of 86,535 attempted was set in the 2021-22 season. At the current pace, 33,000 made 3s is within reach and 92,000 of them getting attempted isn't impossible either.",
      "It'll be the 17th time in the last 22 seasons that the NBA has seen more 3s than ever before.",
      "Teams are trying 6.8% more 3-pointers, on average, than they did last season. This would be the biggest year-over-year jump in the last six seasons.",
      "Translation: The 3-point craze is not ending anytime soon.",
      "If you've paid any attention this season, you know this isn't just the Celtics going wild from deep. Almost every team is shooting 3s at a dizzying rate \u2014 with Chicago simply obliterating its team record.",
      "The Bulls had never made more than 941 3s in a season; they're at 1,171 already this season. They're on pace for massive increases over last season \u2014 up 36% increase in 3s made, up 32% in 3s attempted over a year ago.",
      "Also currently on pace to break club records for 3s made, attempted or both in a season: Boston, Brooklyn, Charlotte, Cleveland, Detroit, the Los Angeles Lakers, Memphis, Miami, Minnesota, Oklahoma City, Philadelphia, Phoenix, San Antonio and Washington.",
      "It's not for everyone. Houston is on pace for the eighth-most 3s made and attempted in a season; to be fair, the Rockets of a few years ago were of the go-go-go, shoot-shoot-shoot mold, and this team is not. Dallas and Milwaukee are both on pace for only the seventh-most 3s attempted in any of their seasons.",
      "The record number of players making 100 3-pointers in a season is 125, set last season. It could be topped; entering Monday, 118 players had at least 100 3s this season.",
      "Let's put this into more perspective: A decade ago \u2014 2014-15 \u2014 there were only 57 players to make 100 3-pointers.",
      "That number has more than doubled since.",
      "Making 10 3s doesn't guarantee winning \u2014 but not making at least 10 3s in a game puts teams in serious trouble.",
      "Entering Monday, teams that don't make at least 10 3-pointers lose 72% of the time this season. Teams that don't make at least 15 3-pointers lose 59% of the time.",
      "Teams that make 15 or more 3s in a game win 65% of the time. Here's a weird quirk, though: Making 20 or more 3s in a game has led to victory 74% of the time this season \u2014 which is actually down from 83% last season, 82% in 2022-23 and 91% in 2021-22.",
      "Not everyone is part of the 3-point craze.",
      "There are four players \u2014 the Los Angeles Clippers\u2019 Ivica Zubac, Detroit\u2019s Jalen Duren, Minnesota\u2019s Rudy Gobert and Dallas\u2019 Daniel Gafford \u2014 who have at least 500 points this season and have yet to try a 3-point shot.",
      "Cleveland\u2019s Jarrett Allen (0 for 4 on 3-pointers), Charlotte\u2019s Mark Williams (0 for 1), New Orleans\u2019 Yves Missi (0 for 1) and Phoenix\u2019s Nick Richards (0 for 2) were close to being on that list.",
      "Oklahoma City\u2019s Isaiah Hartenstein is over the 500-point threshold \u2014 but is 0 for 18 on 3s this season. Only three players have ever tried more 3s in a season without a make; Gene Banks was 0 for 19 in 1985-86, Magic Johnson was 0 for 21 in 1982-83 and Tom Garrick was 0 for 22 in 1990-91.",

    "story": [
      "In Wayne Gretzky's hometown of Brantford, Ontario, and across Canada, the Great One's loyalty and legacy are being questioned at a time the nation's independence is being threatened by U.S. President Donald Trump",
      "BRANTFORD, Ontario -- John Davidson has difficulty remembering the last time Wayne Gretzky visited his childhood home across the street in this small city a couple hours' drive southwest of Toronto.",
      "The modestly plain house with a one-car garage in a quiet residential neighborhood remains in the family, but the Great One\u2019s visits have been fewer and farther between, especially since his beloved father Walter died in 2021. The backyard ice rink where Gretzky developed his generational talent has since been replaced by a pool.",
      "Now 85, Davidson still chases away the occasional curiosity seeker, a far cry from the days when busloads of children would pull up, or the time Wayne and his wife Janet showed up with an entourage, three limousines strong. The retired steelworker then lowered his hand to his knee to indicate how long he's known Gretzky, before saying: \u201cWayne\u2019s changed a lot since he went down to the States.\u201d",
      "Like many in this city of 105,000 and across a nation of 39 million, Davidson has difficulty squaring the child he once knew, the player who won four Stanley Cups in Edmonton and re-wrote the NHL\u2019s scoring records, and the person he sees now.",
      "At 64, Gretzky is now the subject of a once-unimaginable debate over his loyalty to his native Canada due to his ties to President Donald Trump, whose brazen comments about the nation's sovereignty have angered Canadians.",
      "Pictures of Gretzky celebrating Trump\u2019s election night victory at Mar-a-Lago and attending his inauguration don\u2019t sit well at a time Canadians face an existential crisis in the wake of rising tariffs and the president\u2019s comments about turning its northern neighbor into a 51st state. Many find it unsettling that Gretzky is silent on the topic, even with Trump suggesting Gretzky run for office for the eventuality of becoming the nation\u2019s governor once it joins the U.S.",
      "\u201cI always thought the hell out of him,\" Davidson said of Gretzky. \"Hate is a terrible word. Dislike is a better word.",
      "\u201cIt disappoints the hell out of me. And I don\u2019t think his father would appreciate it either,\u201d he added. \u201cA lot of people are pissed off with him right now because he went and kissed the ring.\u201d",
      "Gretzky did not respond to messages seeking comment from The Associated Press for this story.",
      "Gretzky's on-ice exploits remain legendary and they begin at an early age. When he was 11, he scored 378 goals and 517 points in 85 games for the atom division Brantford Nadrofsky Steelers. By 13, he had already scored 1,000 goals, and was essentially chased out of Brantford by adults \u2014 even parents of his teammates \u2014 booing Gretzky for the attention he was generating.",
      "His parents relocated him to play in Toronto, before Gretzky made the jump to the Ontario Hockey League, where in his only full season in 1977-78 he scored 70 goals and piled up 182 points, which still ranks second on the league's list.",
      "Though he played on four NHL teams, ending his career with the New York Rangers in 1999, befitting his No. 99, Gretzky is best known for his 10 seasons in Edmonton, including his first when the Oilers played in the World Hockey Association. Gretzky became an icon in Alberta's capital for the championships and attention; his marriage to American actor Janet Jones in July 1988 was called \u201cThe Royal Wedding\u201d and broadcast live across Canada.",
      "Brantford is dubbed \u201cThe Telephone City\u201d for once being home to Alexander Graham Bell, but Gretzky\u2019s influence abounds. His charitable foundation provides for numerous local causes, including Special Olympics and distributing free hockey sticks to children.",
      "Inside the four-rink, two-swimming pool Wayne Gretzky Sports Centre is the region\u2019s sports hall of fame, featuring a large collection of the Great One\u2019s memorabilia. Outside is a statue of Gretzky raising the Stanley Cup with three smaller statues looking on, representing his parents and a young Gretzky wearing a Red Wings' Gordie Howe jersey.",
      "All this in honor of a person who has been gone for a majority of his life, and makes his home in the U.S. Of his five children, daughter Paulina is best known for her marriage to top golfer Dustin Johnson. And while the Gretzkys are a far cry from the Kardashians, there is a Hollywood shine to the family that previously served as a mild curiosity to most Canadians.",
      "It's unclear when Gretzky and Trump became friends, though it likely revolves around golf.",
      "In the 1980s, Oilers players enjoyed occasional rounds of golf with Trump through his friendship with then-franchise owner Peter Pocklington. The relationship between Gretzky and the president likely grew stronger through Johnson, who has often golfed with Trump.",
      "Gretzky's ties with Trump might have raised a few curious head turns in the past, but never approached the turmoil it has reached today.",
      "Recently, CTV reported, the face of Gretzky's statue outside of the Edmonton Oilers arena had been smeared with feces, part of a polarizing debate that's raised ire among his detractors and eye-rolls from his defenders.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s done so many good things in both of these countries, he doesn\u2019t need to explain himself to anybody,\u201d said Brantford councilor Dan McCreary, whose ward includes Gretzky sports complex. He referred to Gretzky's critics as being part of a \u201ccancel culture\u201d movement.",
      "Though no fan of the president, McCreary called it \u201ca deficit of leadership\u201d in equally blaming Trump and former Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau for the fallout.",
      "Not lost on McCreary is how Brantford sits in the crosshairs of the cross-border dispute. The city serves as a transportation hub \u2014 a two-and-a-half-hour drive from three border crossings \u2014 and with a manufacturing base linked to the auto industry, now facing potential fallout from U.S. tariffs.",
      "\u201cYou might suggest that to him,\u201d McCreary said when asked if Gretzky could put in a good word to Trump about his hometown.",
      "The effects of the trade dispute and surge in patriotism are apparent in Brantford. Grocery stores highlight Canadian-made products \u2014 from soup to nuts and maple syrup \u2014 and provincially controlled liquor stores have removed all U.S. wines and whiskeys from their shelves.",
      "Meantime, the Gretzky name is everywhere. Bars feature signed posters. There's a Gretzky party room in a chain restaurant around the corner from his childhood home. There's the Wayne Gretzky Parkway, a winding five-mile, four-lane thoroughfare that's suddenly become a sticking point.",
      "A sense of national pride led to Kat Philp launching a petition to rename the road after Walter, who held the honorary title of Brantford's Lord Mayor for his extensive community work.",
      "The issue is not whose Wayne Gretzky's friends are \u2014 \u201cYou do you,\u201d Philp said. Instead, she feels betrayed by his failure to voice support for Canada.",
      "\u201cWe always felt he was still Canadian. We don\u2019t feel that way anymore,\" said Philp, 50, who grew up playing hockey, attended Gretzky\u2019s celebrity slow-pitch tournaments as a teenager and was proud in telling people she was from Gretzky's hometown.",
      "Pocklington, the former Oilers owner, is stunned by the backlash directed at someone he's known since purchasing the 17-year-old player\u2019s rights in 1978 and bringing him to Edmonton to usher in the franchise's heyday before trading him to Los Angeles.",
      "\"Wayne is not a politician. He\u2019s a hockey player. Period. And his heart has always been in Canada, with Canada,\u201d Pocklington said from his home in Desert Palm, California. \u201cI\u2019m not sure he\u2019d stand up in his own defense but I think he probably feels sorry for them more than anything.\u201d",
      "For all those defending Gretzky, including his wife Janet and Ontario Premier Doug Ford, what\u2019s notable, too, are those who haven\u2019t.",
      "Hockey Hall of Fame goalie Ken Dryden declined an interview request, writing \u201cThis is something Wayne Gretzky needs to think through,\u201d in an email to the AP. Canada-Russia 1972 Summit Series star Paul Henderson laughed, saying he stays out of politics. And there's not been a peep from Mark Messier, Gretzky's former teammate and current TV analyst.",
      "Hall of Fame goalie Dominik Hasek was among the exceptions as the debate over Gretzky\u2019s legacy lingers with Alex Ovechkin closing in on the Great One\u2019s NHL goal-scoring title.",
      "\u201cThe whole world saw Wayne at a party at the American President\u2019s home,\u201d Hasek wrote in a text to the AP from his home in the Czech Republic.",
      "\u201cIt is not surprising to me that Canadian people are asking about the attitude of a man who is a Canadian icon,\u201d Hasek added. \"To be honest, I am also interested in his attitude. He must know best why he does not express himself on this. Be sure to ask him.\u201d",

      "CHICAGO -- Illinois state Rep. Travis Weaver remembers how surreal it felt having Heisman Trophy winner Mark Ingram sit a few rows behind him in a political science class. He will never forget the pure joy in Alabama every time the Crimson Tide rolled to the national championship, either.",
      "Weaver was there for two title runs as a student from 2010 to 2015. The way he sees it, coach Nick Saban and his players weren't the only winners.",
      "\u201cThe city of Tuscaloosa, the state of Alabama, the employers who recruited the University of Alabama because there\u2019s higher-caliber students there -- they all benefited massively because of the success of the football team,\" Weaver said. \"Coach Saban made that a different school than when he got there. Obviously, the football team was better. But what I saw as a student was an entire community become much stronger because of that success.\u201d",
      "His college experience is driving the push he's now making.",
      "Weaver wants to give an assist to Illinois schools and entice more recruits to stay home by exempting up to $100,000 in name, image and likeness earnings from the state income tax. In Georgia and Alabama, lawmakers are looking to eliminate income tax on NIL earnings altogether. There's a similar push in Louisiana.",
      "Lawmakers see the legislation they are proposing as a way to level the hyper-competitive recruiting field if not gain an advantage. Their universities are going against schools from Florida, Tennessee and Texas, states where income is not taxed.",
      "The measures could face pushback from other students who make money off their name, image and likeness such as social media influencers, actors and musicians. They might wonder why the quarterback and point guard are getting an exemption but not them.",
      "There is precedent. In 2016, President Barack Obama signed a bill that eliminated the so-called federal \u201cvictory tax\u201d on Olympic medalists, preventing the IRS from collecting on medals and prize money up to $1 million. Then again, state lawmakers have to decide if the proposed measures are worth the potential challenges even if they're on solid legal footing.",
      "\u201cThe optics of it probably aren\u2019t great for people that are YouTubers, and some college kids are paying in-state tax and some aren\u2019t,\u201d said Daniel Ryan, a former IRS attorney now at Sullivan and Worcester in Boston. \u201cBut I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s a constitutional issue that would prevent it from happening.\u201d",
      "Attorney Michael Rueda of Withers Worldwide has worked with athletes and schools on NIL matters. He said states would \u201chave to make the argument that there\u2019s a legitimate rationale to distinguish between taxpayers.\u201d",
      "There are nine with no income tax: Alaska, Florida, Nevada, New Hampshire, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Washington and Wyoming. Though the idea of saving money might be attractive, accountants and attorneys who work with athletes and colleges say tax rates generally aren't at the top of their clients\u2019 priority lists. They look more at their role, the team's competitiveness and their marketing opportunities.",
      "In that sense, they're just like the pros.",
      "\u201cWhat seems to be the number one choice for them after you get past the money?\" said Richard Koenigsberg, an accountant at Eisner Advisory Group in New York who has worked with college and professional athletes. \"Because we have seen athletes turn down the highest-priced contract.\u201d",
      "As for a potential exemption on NIL income?",
      "\u201cCarson Beck -- did he go to (Miami) just to avoid Georgia income tax?\" said Michael Guariglia, an attorney with McCarter & English in New Jersey who has worked with colleges on NIL. \"I think it was more important to him to get the assurances that he was going to be their starting quarterback. Could it be a factor? Yeah, maybe. It plays into a lot of different things.\u201d",
      "Recruits from New Jersey, for example, who go to school in Florida still have to pay income tax in their state unless they change residence. And income for someone from Florida who goes to school in Jersey might still be exempt.",
      "Athletes in Georgia, Alabama, Louisiana and, maybe to a lesser extent, Illinois who choose to stay home would be in for a break if the legislation passes.",
      "In Georgia, where there's a flat rate of 5.39%, a recruit who stays in state would figure to save about $5,400 on $100,000 in NIL money. In Alabama \u2014 where it ranges from 2% to 5% for a single earner making more than $3,000 \u2014 the savings on $100,000 would be about $5,000. In Louisiana \u2014 which just implemented a flat 3% rate \u2014 that translates to $3,000.",
      "The savings for athletes making seven figures in NIL money would obviously be much more significant; in Illinois, not as much since Weaver's plan would exempt only the first $100,000.",
      "In that scenario, basketball or football players with their eyes on the NBA or NFL might still wind up paying state tax on at least a portion of their NIL earnings. Athletes with less lucrative deals might be completely covered and a little more inclined to stay in state as a result.",
      "To Weaver, it's more about helping the mid-major schools in the state such as Bradley, Illinois State, Western Illinois and Loyola Chicago than the Big Ten's Illinois and Northwestern.",
      "\u201cIf those schools are just a little bit more successful and you get that extra 10% bump in applications more periodically, they can help Peoria, Ill., Bloomington, Ill., Macomb, Ill.,\" said Weaver, a Republican from Peoria.",
      "Though Weaver said the state would lose about $750,000 in income tax revenue, he considers it a worthwhile investment. He envisions increases in enrollment, attendance at games, merchandise sales, hotel bookings and more that come with success on the court and field.",
      "Exhibit A: Loyola.",
      "The Jesuit school on Chicago's North Side saw big jumps in applications and merchandise sales following runs to the Final Four in 2018 and Sweet 16 in 2021. Sister Jean bobbleheads and maroon-and-gold scarves became popular items.",
      "\u201cIf we can help -- you pick the mid-major -- make the NCAA Tournament once every three years instead of once every five years, and that means twice as often they\u2019re getting that 10% boost in applications, that could be something that really is a difference maker in keeping one of those smaller schools afloat for the long term,\u201d Weaver said.",

      "Since the plane crash that killed his parents, figure skater Maxim Naumov has become in many ways the face of the tragedy",
      "BOSTON -- Maxim Naumov came to a stop in the middle of the ice, looked up at the sky and patted his heart. Then he mouthed a few words, in Russian, to his parents:",
      "\u201cThis is for you guys. You guys are with me. I love you both.\u201d",
      "Former world pairs champions Vadim Naumov and Evgenia Shishkova died in January when their plane crashed into a military helicopter on approach to Washington, D.C., and fell into the icy Potomac River. A total of 67 people were killed, including more than two dozen who were returning from a development camp following the U.S. figure skating championships in Wichita, Kansas.",
      "Maxim Naumov, who finished fourth at nationals, already had returned home. Since the crash, he has become in many ways the face of the tragedy \u2014 or at least its effect on the skating community.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve walked through a hallway and haven\u2019t given a hug since. And I feel that support and love,\u201d he said Sunday. \u201cIt\u2019s been beyond anything that I could have ever even imagined. And it helps so much to get through this day.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s overwhelming,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it makes my heart so full.\u201d",
      "Naumov, 23, skated in a benefit in Washington earlier this month that raised more than $1.2 million for the victims\u2019 families. Speaking to reporters Sunday after performing at the world championships gala, Naumov said the time that he is on the ice gives his mind a chance to escape the tragedy.",
      "\u201cAs soon as I hit the ice, my brain just \u2014 I don\u2019t know whether it\u2019s focus or just calmness or stillness or what, but it feels like I tune everything out,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m just talking with them, and they\u2019re helping me.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t hear the crowd. I don\u2019t hear the announcers, I don\u2019t hear anything. I just have this internal dialogue and I\u2019m just able to almost be calm and just be in my heart,\u201d Naumov said. \u201cAnd they\u2019re always there, too. And every time I think of them, especially when I\u2019m on the ice, it really, really helps me get through.\u201d",
      "The world championships, which had previously been scheduled at the home of Boston's Celtics and Bruins, brought renewed attention to the plane crash and the century-old Skating Club of Boston that has been a home for Olympians and recreational skaters alike.",
      "There was a tribute on Wednesday, sandwiched between the day's two sessions, and frequent reminders of the tragedy.",
      "Alisa Efimova and Misha Mitrofanov, who finished sixth in pairs this weekend, held up pictures of the Boston club members who died in the crash: two young skaters, their mothers and the two coaches. Reigning U.S. champion Amber Glenn wore a T-shirt honoring the memory of all the young skaters who were lost.",
      "Ilia Malinin, the \u201cQuad God\u201d who won his second straight world championship on Saturday night, finished the show on Sunday with a performance that he said was dedicated to the plane crash victims. He came to the end, red-eyed and choking back tears.",
      "Naumov\u2019s introduction on Sunday identified him as a member of the Boston club and included his three fourth-place finishes at nationals. It didn\u2019t mention the crash, but many in the crowd surely knew his connection: He received not only the polite applause that greeted most of the other skaters, but a second wave, with individuals standing to cheer him on.",
      "Wearing unadorned black pants and a sparkly black top, a gold chain flopping around his neck as he glided across the ice, Naumov gave a gala performance aimed more at emotion than proof of athletic prowess.",
      "The choice of music, Mac Miller\u2019s posthumous 2020 release \u201cThat\u2019s on Me,\u201d was intentional. Miller died of an accidental drug overdose in 2018.",
      "\u201cLately, for some reason \u2014 well, not for some reason \u2014 but lately I\u2019ve just been listening to Mac Miller\u2019s album \u2018Circles.\u2019 Like just over and over and over,\u201d Naumov said. \u201cAnd knowing the unfortunate story about him as an artist, it\u2019s been very relatable.",
      "\u201cI relate to it, and I feel really deeply and emotionally what he\u2019s talking about in those songs. And it\u2019s also been really helpful for me to almost get my emotions out in that way personally.\u201d",
      "When his skate was over, Naumov took a deep breath, patted his heart again and waved in each direction. His bows were deep and poignant. Leaving the ice after a one-minute standing ovation, he made the sign of the cross.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of emotions just right now, and it\u2019s hard to even put a name to what I\u2019m feeling currently,\" he said. \"I just feel so much support, and it\u2019s very overwhelming.",
      "\u201cI have so much gratitude,\" Naumov said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m thankful for each and every single one of those fans.\u201d",

      "Marcus Rashford scored his first goals for Aston Villa to help his new team beat second-tier Preston 3-0 on Sunday and reach the FA Cup semifinals for the first time since 2015.",
      "Rashford has reignited his career at Villa since joining on loan from Manchester United on Feb. 2 and has just got back in the England squad, starting the recent World Cup qualifiers against Albania and Latvia.",
      "The striker tapped home Lucas Digne\u2019s cross for the opener at Deepdale in the 58th minute and then converted a penalty in the 63rd after Morgan Rogers was fouled. Jacob Ramsey wrapped up a comfortable victory for Villa in the 71st.",
      "Villa hasn\u2019t won a trophy since capturing the English League Cup in 1996 but has a great chance in the FA Cup this season, with many of the country\u2019s top teams already eliminated.",
      "Crystal Palace and Nottingham Forest advanced on Saturday, while Manchester City plays away against Bournemouth in the remaining quarterfinal match later Sunday.",
      "In the draw for the semifinals, Palace was paired with Villa while Forest takes on the winner of the Bournemouth-Man City match.",
      "If City loses, Villa will likely be the favorite given the team is back in the big time under Spanish manager Unai Emery, even reaching the Champions League quarterfinals this season.",
      "Villa has won the FA Cup seven times, but not since 1957. It lost 4-0 to Arsenal in the 2015 final.",
      "Preston, the only non-Premier League team in the last eight, was playing its first FA Cup quarterfinal match since the 1965-66 season.",
      "The semifinals will be played at Wembley Stadium.",

      "LONDON -- A volcano began erupting in southwestern Iceland on Tuesday, just hours after authorities evacuated a nearby community and a geothermal spa, one of Iceland\u2019s biggest tourist attractions.",
      "Flames and smoke shot through the air as the volcanic fissure opened near the town of Grindavik, where some 40 homes have been evacuated, national broadcaster RUV reported. The community, located on the Reykjanes Peninsula, was largely evacuated a year ago when the volcano came to life after lying dormant for 800 years.",

      "\u201cThe total length of the eruptive fissure is now about 1,200 meters (3,937 feet) and continues to extend southward,'' Iceland's Met Office said in a statement, adding that it had received a report that a hot water pipeline had broken in the northern part of Grindav\u00edk.",

      "NASHVILLE, Tenn. -- The nation's largest public utility on Monday promoted one of its top executives to CEO, putting Don Moul in charge of the Tennessee Valley Authority as President Donald Trump has cast renewed attention on the federal entity.",
      "The utility announced that its board picked Moul as president and chief executive to replace Jeff Lyash, who said in January that he would retire no later than September. The move comes less than a week after Trump removed one of the utility's board members without indicating why. With the firing of Michelle Moore, an appointee of former President Joe Biden, the board currently has five members and four vacancies.",
      "The board firing and CEO hiring come after Tennessee's two Republican U.S. senators urged officials to opt for \u201can interim CEO trusted by the president\u201d before hiring someone long-term.",
      "Moul has served as TVA's executive vice president and chief operating officer since June 2021. In a news release announcing his selection, TVA focused in part on Moul's leadership in the advancement of nuclear energy technologies and his experience as a licensed senior reactor operator. He starts in the new role on April 9.",
      "\u201cTVA needs a steady hand right now,\" Moul said in the news release. \"I will build on the momentum that Jeff and our team have created -\u2013 making sure we continue to invest in new generation, strengthen our grid and enhance system reliability.\u201d",
      "Earlier this month, U.S. Sens. Marsha Blackburn and Bill Hagerty wrote a guest column arguing that the TVA board was bogging down a project that seeks to build a small modular reactor with studies and hurdles.",
      "Blackburn and Hagerty also said that hiring a CEO from within would forgo the chance to recruit a \u201ctop-quality leader\u201d from outside the utility, which provides power to 10 million people across seven Southern states.",
      "In part, advocates for nuclear energy have called for its expansion to help meet the demand from companies to power their artificial intelligence technologies, and do so without carbon emissions that speed up climate change.",
      "Stephen Smith, executive director of the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy, called the op-ed by Blackburn and Hagerty \u201creckless interference.\u201d He said they don't understand the \u201crisk of rushing nuclear technology before it\u2019s ready for prime time both economically and safety-wise.\u201d",
      "Clean energy advocates have also criticized TVA's decision to replace several of its aging coal plants with another fossil fuel, natural gas.",
      "Trump put TVA and the outgoing CEO Lyash on the hot seat in his first term.",
      "In 2020, Trump fired the former TVA board chairman and another board member and drove TVA to reverse course on the hiring of foreign labor for information technology jobs.",
      "He also called for Lyash\u2019s replacement and the position\u2019s pay to be capped at $500,000.",
      "In response, TVA has noted that the CEO pay ranks in the bottom quartile of the power industry. Lyash\u2019s total compensation topped $10.5 million in the 2024 budget year, including various pension and performance incentives worth millions of dollars. Additionally, the utility has stressed that it doesn\u2019t receive federal taxpayer money and instead is funded by electricity customers.",
      "A TVA spokesperson has said Lyash's retirement was not related to the administration or current politics and that Lyash had begun talking to TVA board members last fall about considering retirement.",

      "Rescue teams in Myanmar and Thailand are searching for survivors after Friday's 7.7 magnitude quake that toppled buildings and damaged roads. The disaster has killed more than 2,000 people in Myanmar and at least 18 in Thailand, mainly at a Bangkok office tower construction site.",
      "Most rescues happen in the 24 hours after a disaster. The chances of survival drop with each day after that, experts say. Most victims are badly injured or buried by falling stones or other debris.",
      "Trapped victims are more likely to survive if they are in a debris-free pocket that prevents major injury while they await rescue, like under a sturdy desk, said geophysicist Victor Tsai from Brown University in an email. Experts call this a survivable void space.",
      "If fire, smoke or hazardous chemicals were released as a result of the building collapse, they may decrease a person's survival odds, said emergency response expert Dr. Joseph Barbera, an associate professor at George Washington University.",
      "Beyond that, having air to breathe and water to drink are crucial as the days go on.",
      "\u201cYou could survive a while without food,\u201d Barbera said. \u201cYou could survive less without water.\u201d",
      "Temperatures where someone is trapped may affect survival, and temperatures outside the rubble can affect rescue missions.",
      "Power outages and spotty communications have slowed relief operations in Myanmar, where many are searching for survivors by hand in daily temperatures above 40 degrees Celsius (104 Fahrenheit). A lack of heavy machinery has slowed search-and-rescue efforts.",
      "It can be important for survivors to receive vital medical care before they are removed from the rubble, Barbera said. If not, the buildup of toxins from crushed muscles could make them go into shock after they are rescued.",
      "After the 2011 earthquake and tsunami in Japan, a teenager and his 80-year-old grandmother were found alive after nine days trapped in their flattened home. And the year before, a 16-year-old Haitian girl was rescued from earthquake rubble in Port-Au-Prince after 15 days.",
      "The best practices for survival during an earthquake depend on where you are in the world. Building codes in regions with active fault lines are often designed to withstand earthquakes, but that doesn't hold true everywhere.",
      "In many countries, including the United States, the best practices are to drop, seek cover and hang on unless you are close to a building exit. Seek shelter under a heavy table or near sturdy furniture that may yield a survivable pocket if the roof collapses. Cover your face with cloth or a mask to protect from dust and debris.",
      "If you are trapped in the rubble after and earthquake, save your energy and don't overexert. Ration food and water, listen for rescue calls and search for something near you to make noise. If you have a phone with you, conserve its battery and try for help in short spurts each day.",

      "The clouds eventually moved and it took a few more hours for another satellite from San Francisco-based Planet Labs to capture the aerial pictures and send them to Microsoft's philanthropic AI for Good Lab. By then it was already about 11 p.m. Friday at Microsoft headquarters in Redmond, Washington. A group of Microsoft workers was ready and waiting for the data.",
      "The AI for Good lab has done this kind of AI-assisted damage assessment before, tracking the flooding that devastated Libya in 2023 or this year's wildfires in Los Angeles. But rather than rely on a standard AI computer vision model that could run any visual data, they had to build a customized version specific to Mandalay.",
      "\u201cThe Earth is too different, the natural disasters are too different and the imagery we get from satellites is just too different to work in every situation,\u201d Lavista Ferres said. For instance, he said, while fires spread in fairly predictable ways, \u201can earthquake touches the whole city\u201d and it can be harder to know in the immediate aftermath where help is needed.",
      "Once the AI analysis was complete, it showed 515 buildings in Mandalay with 80% to 100% damage and another 1,524 with between 20% and 80% damage. That showed the widespread gravity of the disaster, but, just as important, it helps pinpoint specific locations of damage.",
      "\u201cThis is critical information for teams on the ground,\u201d Lavista Ferres said.",
      "Microsoft cautioned that it \"should serve as a preliminary guide and will require on-the-ground verification for a complete understanding.\" But in the meantime, the tech company has shared the analysis with aid groups such as the Red Cross.",

      "Dubbed the wooly devil, the flower with furry leaves, purplish-striped petals and pops of yellow is a new genus and species in the same family as sunflowers and daisies: Asteraceae. It was discovered last year in Big Bend National Park, known for its rugged terrain of desert, canyons and mountains, on the border with Mexico.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a lot to learn with this species so they\u2019re really just getting started,\u201d said Carolyn Whiting, a Big Bend botanist.",
      "Scientists are hopeful the flowers will bloom again after rain fell on the drought-stricken park last week, giving them the opportunity to learn more including when the plants germinate, Whiting said.",
      "The flower was discovered in March 2024. Park volunteer Deb Manley and a park ranger were hiking in a remote area when they saw a patch of flowers that were smaller than a quarter and close to the ground.",
      "\u201cWe stopped and took some photos and neither one of us had any idea,\u201d Manley said. \u201cI could get it to family but I couldn\u2019t figure out any more than that. So we took photos and moved on, not realizing we had found a new genus.\u201d",
      "When Manley got back from the hike, she started researching what the flower could be. She soon found that not only was she stumped, but others were too. Her post about the flower on iNaturalist, an online platform for nature enthusiasts \u201ccaused a stir,\u201d said Isaac Lichter Marck, a researcher at the California Academy of Sciences in San Francisco.",
      "A. Michael Powell, curator and director of the herbarium at Sul Russ State University in Alpine, said when Manley contacted him about the flower, he immediately thought it was something new.",
      "\u201cIt wasn\u2019t anything I\u2019d seen before,\u201d said Powell, who has extensively studied the region.",
      "By the time a team went to collect samples of the flower a few weeks after the discovery, they had already begun to wither away.",
      "\u201cWe really got out there just in the nick of time before the specimens would have been completely dried up,\u201d Whiting said.",
      "The discovery of the flower was announced last month.",
      "Lichter Marck said they were able to extract DNA from the flower but that there's still a lot to learn. He said they don\u2019t know yet how it reproduces, or what potential uses it might have. They also need to determine if it\u2019s endangered.",
      "The wooly devil's official name \u2014 Ovicula biradiata \u2014 takes inspiration from its appearance: Ovicula, which means tiny sheep, is a nod to the hairs that cover its leaves; while biradiata, or bi-radial, refers to its two striped petals.",
      "Kelsey Wogan, environmental lab manager at Sul Ross State University, said she\u2019s excited to see if the wooly devil can be found in other places as well and what its range is.",
      "Whiting said the park is so well-studied that finding a new species was a surprise.",
      "\u201cThe fact that there\u2019s still species out there that had slipped under the radar is pretty remarkable,\u201d she said.",
      "Wogan said part of the excitement about the flower's discovery is that it shows \u201cthere\u2019s still new and undescribed things out there.\u201d",

      "Although it\u2019s still experimental, they hope the brain-computer interface could someday help give voice to those unable to speak.",
      "A new study described testing the device on a 47-year-old woman with quadriplegia who couldn\u2019t speak for 18 years after a stroke. Doctors implanted it in her brain during surgery as part of a clinical trial.",
      "It \u201cconverts her intent to speak into fluent sentences,\u201d said Gopala Anumanchipalli, a co-author of the study published Monday in the journal Nature Neuroscience.",
      "Other brain-computer interfaces, or BCIs, for speech typically have a slight delay between thoughts of sentences and computerized verbalization. Such delays can disrupt the natural flow of conversation, potentially leading to miscommunication and frustration, researchers said.",
      "This is \"a pretty big advance in our field,\u201d said Jonathan Brumberg of the Speech and Applied Neuroscience Lab at the University of Kansas, who was not part of the study.",
      "A team in California recorded the woman\u2019s brain activity using electrodes while she spoke sentences silently in her brain. The scientists used a synthesizer they built using her voice before her injury to create a speech sound that she would have spoken. They trained an AI model that translates neural activity into units of sound.",
      "It works similar to existing systems used to transcribe meetings or phone calls in real time, said Anumanchipalli, of the University of California, Berkeley.",
      "The implant itself sits on the speech center of the brain so that it\u2019s listening in, and those signals are translated to pieces of speech that make up sentences. It\u2019s a \u201cstreaming approach,\u201d Anumanchipalli said, with each 80-millisecond chunk of speech \u2013 about half a syllable \u2013 sent into a recorder.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not waiting for a sentence to finish,\u201d Anumanchipalli said. \u201cIt\u2019s processing it on the fly.\u201d",
      "Decoding speech that quickly has the potential to keep up with the fast pace of natural speech, said Brumberg. The use of voice samples, he added, \u201cwould be a significant advance in the naturalness of speech.\"",
      "Though the work was partially funded by the National Institutes of Health, Anumanchipalli said it wasn't affected by recent NIH research cuts. More research is needed before the technology is ready for wide use, but with \u201csustained investments,\" it could be available to patients within a decade, he said.",

      "BANGKOK -- Chinese telecoms gear giant Huawei said Monday its net profit fell 28% in 2024 while its revenue surged, as the company invested heavily in advanced technologies.",
      "Huawei Technologies reported 62.6 billion yuan ($8.6 billion) in net profit last year, down from 87 billion yuan the year before. Its revenue jumped 22% to $118.2 billion, with the strongest growth in its consumer goods and automotive-related sales.",
      "The company, based in the southern city of Shenzhen, said the decline in profit was mainly due to two factors, \u201cWe continued to increase our future-oriented investment and there were no gains from the sale of businesses.\u201d",
      "One of China's first global tech brands, Huawei said its spending on research and development amounted to more than a fifth of its revenues, and more than half its workforce, or 113,000 people, are employed in R&D.",
      "Spending on R&D was 179.7 billion yuan (nearly $25 billion).",
      "Constrained by mounting trade tensions, Huawei and other Chinese tech companies are working hard to make up for shrinking access to U.S. and other foreign advanced technology.",
      "Citing national security concerns, the U.S. has banned American companies from doing business with Huawei, cutting off its access to advanced computer chips and software such as Google services for its smartphones. It is not allowed to sell its telecommunications gear to U.S. customers.",
      "The U.S. has also pushed its European allies including Britain and Sweden to ban or restrict Huawei equipment in their phone networks over fears Beijing could use it for cybersnooping or sabotaging critical communications infrastructure \u2014 allegations Huawei has denied repeatedly. Japan, Australia, New Zealand and Canada have taken similar actions.",
      "Huawei denies that it poses any threat to its customers' national security.",
      "Its consumer unit, which sells smartphones and other devices, reported a 38.3% jump in revenue last year. Automotive services-related sales more than quadrupled. Revenues from Huawei's cloud computing business climbed 8.5% and its digital power unit logged a 24.4% increase in sales.",

      "PARIS -- France\u2019s antitrust watchdog fined Apple 150 million euros ($162 million) on Monday over a privacy feature protecting users from apps snooping on them because its introduction resulted in abuse of competition law.",
      "The French Competition Authority said the aim of Apple\u2019s App Tracking Transparency (ATT) requiring iPhone and iPad apps to ask users for permission before tracking them was not in itself open to criticism.",
      "But it ruled that the \u201cway in which it was implemented was neither necessary nor proportionate to Apple\u2019s stated objective of protecting personal data.\u201d",
      "Apple rolled out ATT starting in April 2021 as part of an update to the operating system powering the iPhone and iPad. The feature forces apps to obtain permission before collecting data to target users with personalized ads. While the feature was designed to tighten up privacy, it faced criticism from Big Tech rivals that it would make it harder for smaller apps to survive without charging consumers.",
      "The fine, punishing Apple for abuse of its dominant position in mobile app distribution, covers the period from April 2021 to July 2023. But the amount is a pittance for the iPhone maker, which earned $124 billion in revenue in the final three months of last year.",
      "The watchdog said the feature's rollout resulted in users being barraged by pop-ups from third-party apps requesting their consent. It bemoaned how the proliferation of these consent windows made it \"excessively complex\" for app users to navigate the iOS environment.",
      "It also questioned the system\u2019s neutrality, saying it penalized the smallest publishers, which depend to a large extent on the collection of third-party data to finance their activity.",
      "Apple said in a statement that ATT gives users more privacy control \u201cthrough a required, clear, and easy-to-understand prompt about one thing: tracking.\u201d",
      "\u201cThat prompt is consistent for all developers, including Apple, and we have received strong support for this feature from consumers, privacy advocates, and data protection authorities around the world,\u201d the company said. \"While we are disappointed with today\u2019s decision, the French Competition Authority (FCA) has not required any specific changes to ATT.\u201d",

      "There is plenty of nostalgia at Black Mountain, New Hampshire's oldest ski area",
      "Jackson, N.H. -- A skier since age 4, Thomas Brennick now enjoys regular trips to New Hampshire\u2019s Black Mountain with his two grandchildren.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s back to the old days,\u201d he said from the Summit Double chairlift on a recent sunny Friday. \u201cIt's just good, old-time skiing at its best.\u201d",
      "Behind the scenes, the experience is now propelled by a high-tech system designed to increase efficiency at the state\u2019s oldest ski area. And while small, independent resorts can\u2019t compete on infrastructure or buying power with conglomerates like Vail, which owns nearby Attitash Mountain Resort and seven others in the Northeast alone, at least one entrepreneur is betting technology will be \u201ca really great equalizer.\u201d",
      "That businessman is Erik Mogensen, who bought Black Mountain last year and turned it into a lab for his ski mountain consultancy, Entabeni Systems. The company builds systems that put lift tickets sales, lesson reservations and equipment rentals online while collecting detailed data to inform decisions such as where to make more snow and how much.",
      "\u201cA lot of general managers will go out and look at how many rows of cars are parked, and that\u2019s kind of how they tell how busy they are,\u201d Mogensen said. \u201cWe really want to look at that transactional data down to the deepest level.\u201d",
      "That includes analyzing everything from the most popular time to sell hot dogs in the lodge to how many runs a season pass holder makes per visit.",
      "\u201cThe large operators, they can do a lot of things at scale that we can\u2019t. They can buy 20 snow cats at a time, 10 chairlifts, those types of things. We can\u2019t do that, but we\u2019re really nimble,\u201d Mogensen said. \u201cWe can decide to change the way we groom very quickly, or change the way we open trails, or change our (food and beverage) menu in the middle of a day.\u201d",
      "Mogensen, who says his happiest moments are tied to skiing, started Entabeni Systems in 2015, driven by the desire to keep the sport accessible. In 2023, he bought the company Indy Pass, which allows buyers to ski for two days each at 230 independent ski areas, including Black Mountain. It's an alternative to the Epic and Ikon multi-resort passes offered by the Vail and Alterra conglomerates.",
      "Black Mountain was an early participant in Indy Pass. When Mogensen learned it was in danger of closing, he was reminded of his hometown's long-gone ski area. He bought Black Mountain aiming to ultimately transform it into a cooperative.",
      "Many Indy Pass resorts also are clients of Entabeni Systems, including Utah's Beaver Mountain, which bills itself as the longest continuously-run family owned mountain resort in the U.S.",
      "Kristy Seeholzer, whose husband\u2019s grandfather founded Beaver Mountain, said Entabeni streamlined its ticketing and season pass system. That led to new, lower-priced passes for those willing to forgo skiing during holiday weeks or weekends, she said.",
      "\u201cA lot of our season pass holders were self-limiting anyway. They only want to ski weekdays because they don\u2019t want to deal with weekends,\u201d she said. \u201cWe could never have kept track of that manually.\"",
      "Though she is pleased overall, Seeholzer said the software can be challenging and slow.",
      "\u201cThere are some really great programs out there, like on the retail side of things or the sales side of things. And one of the things that was a little frustrating was it felt like we were reinventing the wheel,\u201d she said.",
      "Sam Shirley, 25, grew up skiing in New Hampshire and worked as a ski instructor and ski school director in Maine while attending college. But he said increasing technology has drastically changed the way he skis, pushing him to switch mostly to cross-country.",
      "\u201cAs a customer, it\u2019s made things more complicated,\u201d he said. \"It just becomes an extra hassle.\u201d",
      "Shirley used to enjoy spur-of-the-moment trips around New England, but has been put off by ski areas reserving lower rates for those who buy tickets ahead. He doesn\u2019t like having to provide detailed contact information, sometimes even a photograph, just to get a lift ticket.",
      "It's not just independent ski areas that are focused on technology and data. Many others are using lift tickets and passes embedded with radio frequency identification chips that track skiers' movements.",
      "Vail resorts pings cell phones to better understand how lift lines are forming, which informs staffing decisions, said John Plack, director of communications. Lift wait times have decreased each year for the past three years, with 97% under 10 minutes this year, he said.",
      "\u201cOur company is a wildly data-driven company. We know a lot about our guest set. We know their tastes. We know what they like to ski, we know when they like to ski. And we\u2019re able to use that data to really improve the guest experience,\u201d he said.",
      "That improvement comes at a cost. A one-day lift ticket at Vail's Keystone Resort in Colorado sold for $292 last week. A season pass cost $418, a potentially good deal for diehard skiers, but also a reliable revenue stream guaranteeing Vail a certain amount of income even as ski areas face less snow and shorter winters.",
      "The revenue from such passes, especially the multi-resort Epic Pass, allowed the company to invest $100 million in snowmaking, Plack said.",
      "\u201cBy committing to the season ahead of time, that gives us certainty and allows us to reinvest in our resorts,\" he said.",
      "Mogensen insists bigger isn\u2019t always better, however. Lift tickets at Black Mountain cost $59 to $99 per day and a season's pass is about $450.",
      "\u201cYou don\u2019t just come skiing to turn left and right. You come skiing because of the way the hot chocolate tastes and the way the fire pit smells and what spring skiing is and what the beer tastes like and who you\u2019re around,\u201d he said. \u201cSkiing doesn\u2019t have to be a luxury good. It can be a community center.\u201d",
      "Brennick, the Black Mountain lift rider who was skiing with his grandchildren, said he has noticed a difference since the ski area was sold.",
      "\u201cI can see the change,\u201d he said. \u201cThey're making a lot of snow and it shows.\u201d",

      "Marks oversaw the agency\u2019s rapid review and approval of COVID-19 vaccines and treatments during the pandemic.",
      "Marks is credited with coining the name and concept for \u201cOperation Warp Speed,\u201d the effort under President Donald Trump to rapidly manufacture vaccines while they were still being tested for safety and efficacy. The initiative cut years off the normal development process.",
      "Despite the project\u2019s success, Trump repeatedly lashed out at the FDA for not approving the first COVID shots even sooner. Trump told confidants after his 2020 loss that he would have been re-elected if the vaccine had been available before Election Day.",

      "\u201cRFK Jr.\u2019s firing of Peter Marks because he wouldn\u2019t bend a knee to his misinformation campaign now allows the fox to guard the hen house,\" Offit said. \u201cIt\u2019s a sad day for America\u2019s children.\u201d",
      "Former FDA Commissioner Dr. Robert Califf said the issues raised in Marks' resignation letter \u201cshould be frightening to anyone committed to the importance of evidence to guide policies and patient decisions.\u201d",
      "\u201cI hope this will intensify the communication across academia, industry and government to bolster the importance of science and evidence,\u201d he wrote.",
      "The resignation follows news Friday that HHS plans to lay off 10,000 workers and shut down entire agencies, including ones that oversee billions of dollars in funds for addiction services and community health centers across the country.",
      "In a post on social media Thursday, Kennedy criticized the department he oversees as an inefficient \u201csprawling bureaucracy.\" He also faulted the department\u2019s 82,000 workers for a decline in Americans\u2019 health.",
      "The resignation is the latest blow to the beleaguered health agency, which has been rocked for weeks by layoffs, retirements and a chaotic return-to-office process that left many staffers without permanent offices, desks or other supplies. Last month, Jim Jones, the FDA\u2019s deputy commissioner for foods, resigned, citing \u201cthe indiscriminate firing\u201d of nearly 90 staffers in his division, according to a copy of his resignation letter obtained by the AP.",

      "A major 7.7 magnitude earthquake that originated near Mandalay, Myanmar shook the Earth as far as Bangkok",
      "Early Friday, a major 7.7 magnitude earthquake that originated near Mandalay, Myanmar, shook the Earth as far as Bangkok, about 800 miles (1,300 kilometers) away.",
      "Two hard-hit cities in Myanmar suffered extensive damage, with images from the capital, Naypyidaw, showing rescue crews pulling victims from the rubble of collapsed buildings. Authorities in Bangkok said deaths had occurred at three construction sites, including a high-rise that collapsed.",
      "Experts say the earthquake, which occurred along the Sagaing Fault, was close to the Earth's surface, generating intense seismic forces. Preliminary estimates by the U.S. Geological Survey show that nearly 800,000 people in Myanmar may have been within the zone of the most violent shaking and that death tolls exceeding 1,000 people, and perhaps much higher, are probable.",
      "The Earth's crust is broken up into several pieces called tectonic plates, which fit together like a jigsaw puzzle.",
      "This formation is \u201cmostly stable, but along the edges they are moving,\u201d Columbia University geophysicist Michael Steckler said.",
      "Pressure builds up when sliding plates get stuck, increasing \u201cvery slowly for decades or for hundreds of years, and then all of a sudden the rock plates will jump,\" triggering shaking that causes an earthquake, Steckler said.",
      "Earthquakes typically occur along edges of tectonic plates. But their impacts may be felt in a broader region.",
      "Earthquakes that occur in the ocean don't always attract attention, but those that occur close to where people live can cause deaths and injuries, most often from collapsed buildings.",
      "Scientists have a good idea of where earthquakes are likely to occur, \"but we can't predict when they'll occur,\u201d USGS seismologist Will Yeck said.",
      "However, after the initial big earthquake, researchers are able to project that other smaller earthquakes nearby, called aftershocks, are likely.",
      "Aftershocks are triggered \u201cbecause of changes to stress in the Earth from the main shock,\u201d Yeck said.",
      "Given the magnitude of the quake in Myanmar, \u201cyou will probably see aftershocks for the next several months,\u201d Steckler said.",

      "\u201cIf you feel shaking, the guidance depends on where you are in the world,\u201d Yeck said.",
      "In many countries, including the United States, if you're inside when an earthquake occurs, it's advisable to drop to the ground, cover your head \u2014 for example, by crawling under a desk or other sturdy structure \u2014 and hold onto that structure, he said. Try to avoid areas near glass windows and don't use building elevators.",

      "\u2014 The Criterion Channel is adding a batch of Vietnam War films around the 50th anniversary of the fall of Saigon. Filmmaker Tony Bui (\u201cThree Seasons\u201d) curated a slate that goes beyond the obvious to give multiple perspectives on the war, including both famous Hollywood entries like \u201cPlatoon\u201d and \u201cFull Metal Jacket,\u201d but also Vietnamese films like \u201cThe Little Girl of Hanoi\u201d and \u201cWhen the Tenth Month Comes.\u201d Documentaries like \u201cThe Fog of War\u201d and \u201cHearts and Minds\u201d will also be available to watch.

On their latest album, \u201cAre We All Angels,\u201d the band pulls from a surprising assortment of influences: Billie Eilish,Radiohead, Car Seat Headrest and boygenius\u2019 Julien Baker among them.

      "LOS ANGELES -- Fans of Studio Ghibli, the famed Japanese animation studio behind \u201cSpirited Away\u201d and other beloved movies, were delighted this week when a new version of ChatGPT let them transform popular internet memes or personal photos into the distinct style of Ghibli founder Hayao Miyazaki.",
      "But the trend also highlighted ethical concerns about artificial intelligence tools trained on copyrighted creative works and what that means for the future livelihoods of human artists. Miyazaki, 84, known for his hand-drawn approach and whimsical storytelling, has expressed skepticism about AI's role in animation.",
      "Janu Lingeswaran wasn't thinking much about that when he uploaded a photo of his 3-year-old ragdoll cat, Mali, into ChatGPT's new image generator tool on Wednesday. He then asked ChatGPT to convert it to the Ghibli style, instantly making an anime image that looked like Mali but also one of the painstakingly drawn feline characters that populate Miyazaki movies such as \u201cMy Neighbor Totoro\u201d or \u201cKiki's Delivery Service.\u201d",
      "\u201cI really fell in love with the result,\u201d said Lingeswaran, an entrepreneur who lives near Aachen, Germany. \u201cWe're thinking of printing it out and hanging it on the wall.\u201d",
      "Similar results gave the Ghibli style to iconic images, such as the casual look of Turkish pistol shooter Yusuf Dikec in a T-shirt and one hand in his pocket on his way to winning a silver medal at the 2024 Olympics. Or the famed \u201cDisaster Girl\u201d meme of a 4-year-old turning to the camera with a slight smile as a house fire rages in the background.",
      "ChatGPT maker OpenAI, which is fighting copyright lawsuits over its flagship chatbot, has largely encouraged the \u201cGhiblification\u201d experiments and its CEO Sam Altman changed his profile on social media platform X into a Ghibli-style portrait. In a technical paper posted Tuesday, the company had said the new tool would be taking a \u201cconservative approach\u201d in the way it mimics the aesthetics of individual artists.",
      "\u201cWe added a refusal which triggers when a user attempts to generate an image in the style of a living artist,\u201d it said. But the company added in a statement that it \u201cpermits broader studio styles \u2014 which people have used to generate and share some truly delightful and inspired original fan creations.\u201d",
      "Studio Ghibli in Japan declined to comment Friday.",
      "As users posted their Ghibli-style images on social media, Miyazaki\u2019s previous comments on AI animation also began to resurface. When Miyazaki was shown an AI demo in 2016, he said he was \u201cutterly disgusted\u201d by the display, according to documentary footage of the interaction. The person demonstrating the animation, which showed a writhing body dragging itself by its head, explained that AI could \u201cpresent us grotesque movements that we humans can\u2019t imagine.\u201d It could be used for zombie movements, the person said.",
      "That prompted Miyazaki to tell a story.",
      "\u201cEvery morning, not in recent days, I see my friend who has a disability,\u201d Miyazaki said. \u201cIt\u2019s so hard for him just to do a high five; his arm with stiff muscle can\u2019t reach out to my hand. Now, thinking of him, I can\u2019t watch this stuff and find it interesting. Whoever creates this stuff has no idea what pain is.\u201d",
      "He said he would \u201cnever wish to incorporate this technology into my work at all.\u201d",
      "\u201cI strongly feel that this is an insult to life itself,\u201d he added.",
      "Josh Weigensberg, a partner at the law firm Pryor Cashman, said that one question the Ghibli-style AI art raises is whether the AI model was trained on Miyazaki or Studio Ghibli\u2019s work. That in turn \u201craises the question of, \u2018Well, do they have a license or permission to do that training or not?\u2019\u201d he said.",
      "OpenAI didn\u2019t respond to a question Thursday about whether it had a license.",
      "Weigensberg added that if a work was licensed for training, it might make sense for a company to permit this type of use. But if this type of use is happening without consent and compensation, he said, it could be \u201cproblematic.\u201d",
      "Weigensberg said that there is a general principle \u201cat the 30,000-foot view\u201d that \u201cstyle\u201d is not copyrightable. But sometimes, he said, what people are actually thinking of when they say \u201cstyle\u201d could be \"more specific, discernible, discrete elements of a work of art,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cA \u2018Howl\u2019s Moving Castle' or \u2018Spirited Away,\u2019 you could freeze a frame in any of those films and point to specific things, and then look at the output of generative AI and see identical elements or substantially similar elements in that output,\u201d he said. \u201cJust stopping at, \u2018Oh, well, style isn\u2019t protectable under copyright law.\u2019 That's not necessarily the end of the inquiry.\u201d",
      "Artist Karla Ortiz, who grew up watching Miyazaki\u2019s movies and is suing other AI image generators for copyright infringement in a case that\u2019s still pending, called it \u201canother clear example of how companies like OpenAI just do not care about the work of artists and the livelihoods of artists.\u201d",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s using Ghibli\u2019s branding, their name, their work, their reputation, to promote (OpenAI) products,\u201d Ortiz said. \u201cIt\u2019s an insult. It\u2019s exploitation.\u201d",
      "Ortiz was further enraged when President Donald Trump\u2019s administration jumped into the meme trend Thursday, using the White House\u2019s official X account to post a Ghibli-style image of a weeping woman from the Dominican Republic recently arrested by U.S. immigration agents. The White House and OpenAI didn\u2019t immediately respond to requests for comment on how the image was made.",
      "\u201cTo see something so brilliant, as wonderful as Miyazaki\u2019s work be butchered to generate something so foul,\u201d Ortiz wrote on social media, adding that she hoped Studio Ghibli sues \u201cthe hell out of\u201d OpenAI for this.",

      "The governing body of figure skating has embarked on an ambitious plan called \u201cVision 2030,\u201d and the idea is simple: Make the sport cool again",
      "BOSTON -- Ashley Wagner and Ben Agosto know what it's like to step off the ice at the figure skating world championships and feel as though they've conquered the sport. And what it feels like when the notoriously fickle sport bites back.",
      "So when the International Skating Union put in motion its ambitious \u201cVision 2030\u201d plan, which is designed to grow and expand the sport through improved fan engagement, it made sense that they would call Wagner, a three-time U.S. champion and former world silver medalist, and Agosto, who won an Olympic silver medal with ice dance partner Tanith Belbin.",
      "If anyone was going to interview athletes at this week's world championships at such an emotionally raw moment, the minute after their programs have concluded, it ought to be someone who has been through it themselves.",
      "\u201cI would have loved this when I was an athlete, to have the post-skate interviews right in the kiss-and-cry, when the emotions are so fresh,\u201d Wagner said. \u201cThat's something being brought into this production. We've never seen anything like it.\u201d",
      "Look closely, and you might notice a lot of things never seen before at this week's worlds: cutting-edge LED dasher boards surrounding the rink, grand entrances for the athletes, and more energetic music \u2014 like the rocked-out version of \u201cI'm Shipping Up to Boston\u201d by the Celtic punk band Dropkick Murphys that keeps blaring inside TD Garden.",
      "The idea is simple: The ISU wants to make figure skating feel cool again.",
      "Or at least, cool to more people.",
      "Those who love the intricate, nuanced sport \u2014 the spins and jumps, the brilliant landings and bitter falls \u2014 tend to follow it year-round. But there are just as many fans that tune in once every four years, during the Winter Olympics, when like a shooting star the athletes spring onto the public consciousness and then fizzle as soon as it ends.",
      "\"Skaters are the reason why this sport exits,\" explained ISU president Jae Youl Kim, who granted The Associated Press a behind-the-scenes tour of the world championship setup Thursday, shortly before the start of the men's short program.",
      "\u201cWe are so proud of our athletes and we want to make sure we shine a brighter, stronger spotlight on our skaters.\u201d",
      "That is why those brilliant LED dasher boards are showcasing each athlete's social media tag, and why each is being introduced individually for the first time, something track and field and other Olympic sports have embraced over the years.",
      "The ISU wants to create a spectacle for the 14,000-plus fans in the arena, along with the millions watching around the world.",
      "\u201cThere's much more to come. I mean, we can brainstorm here a lot about potential marketing and sponsorship activations as well,\u201d said Wieland L\u00fcders, who manages the world championships for the ISU. \u201cEach skater has their own partners, potentially, so there are many more thoughts. But for now, we are just at the beginning. This is the basic concept.\u201d",
      "In the future, the Vision 2030 plan hopes to improve the TV presentation, simplify the sport\u2019s complex rules, increase sponsorship and expand revenue streams. It will also promote skating through grassroots initiatives, reimagine the season-long calendar, and explore new technology that could help to usher the sport into the modern era.",
      "The athletes aren't just benefiting from increased exposure, and the potential boon for their pocketbooks, but also from back-of-the-house upgrades that are a part of Vision 2030. In Boston, an expansive lounge is off limits to everyone but competitors, and back at their hotel, there is a calming room complete with a rotating cast of therapy dogs.",
      "Kim visited it this week. Nobody paid any attention to the ISU president because everybody wanted to see Penny, the dog.",
      "If the calming room is meant to destress, the new hot seat in the arena will probably do the exact opposite.",
      "Much like the time trial in Olympic cycling, where the leader sits uncomfortably on a throne until someone else takes the lead, the ISU has created the same thing at the world championships. But rather than some roped-off backstage area, where leaders have waited for decades, the hot seat is right next to the kiss-and-cry area in the heart of the arena.",
      "The athletes who are coming off the ice after their performance can't help but stare down whomever is in the lead.",
      "\u201cWe want the fans to see how that person is reacting when he or she climbs over to take the throne, or how they are reacting when they cannot make it,\u201d L\u00fcders said. \u201cThey could have interactions with each other, some hugging or high-fives, something like this. So we hope we get more engagement between the two skaters.\u201d",
      "Ultimately, more engagement with the fans, too.",

      "Qatar's government did not immediately respond to a request for comment Thursday. Qatar is the second-largest purchaser of U.S. military equipment after Saudi Arabia, spending over $26 billion for F-15 fighter jets, Apache attack helicopters, missile defense systems and other gear.",
      "The proposed sale now goes to the U.S. Congress. Lawmakers typically weigh in on such sales and, in some cases, can block them.",
      "Under terms of the sale, Qatar would purchase eight of the drones, as well as hundreds of bombs and missiles to arm the pilotless aircraft with and the equipment necessary to fly them by satellite.",
      "General Atomics Reapers, which cost around $30 million apiece, can fly at altitudes over 40,000 feet (12,100 meters) and have an endurance of more than 30 hours before needing to land. The aircraft have been flown by both the U.S. military and the CIA over the Middle East for years, in Afghanistan, Iraq and now over Yemen during the American bombing campaign there. The drone has a land and sea version.",
      "The initial approval for Qatar, however, comes after the nearby United Arab Emirates has been waiting since 2020 to purchase up to 18 MQ-9 drones as part of a $23 billion deal also including advanced F-35 fighter jets. Trump has a particularly close relationship with the UAE, which reached a diplomatic recognition deal with Israel under his administration in 2020.",

    "summary": "New Jersey Democratic Sen. Cory Booker broke a record Tuesday evening, speaking for more than 24 hours in a marathon speech.",
    "story": [
      "The New Jersey Democrat began his speech Monday.",
      "New Jersey Democratic Sen. Cory Booker broke a record Tuesday evening, speaking for more than 24 hours in a marathon speech protesting the national \"crisis\" he said President Donald Trump and Elon Musk had created.",
      "Booker's speech, which began Monday evening, continued for a total of 25 hours and 4 minutes, surpassing the previous record set by Sen. Strom Thurmond, who filibustered the Civil Rights Act of 1957 for 24 hours and 18 minutes.",
      "Shortly before he broke Thurmond's record, as the Senate gallery above the chamber began filling with onlookers and staffers who had gathered to witness the historic event, Booker spoke about his relationship with Georgia Rep. John Lewis, the longtime lawmaker and icon of the civil rights movement who died in 2020.",
      "\"John Lewis would say something; he would do something,\" Booker said in an impassioned voice that was beginning to show signs of strain. \"He wouldn't treat this moral moment as if it were normal.\"",
      "He added, \"This is our moral moment. This is when the most precious ideas of our country are being tested.\"",
      "At approximately 7:20 p.m. Tuesday, Democratic Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer briefly interrupted Booker to inform him he had broken the record.",
      "\"Do you know how proud this caucus is of you? Do you know how proud America is of you?\" Schumer asked.",
      "The chamber erupted in applause. Booker did not immediately end his speech, but continued speaking.",
      "\"From all Americans, this is a moral moment. It's not left or right -- it's right or wrong,\" Booker said, wrapping up his speech at 8:05 p.m. ET.",
      "At the beginning of the marathon speech on Monday evening, Booker said he rose \"with the intention of disrupting the normal business\" of the chamber because he said he believes the country is in \"crisis\" due to the actions of the White House since Trump started his second term.",
      "\"I rise tonight because I believe sincerely that our country is in crisis, and I believe that not in a partisan sense, because so many of the people that have been reaching out to my office in pain, in fear, having their lives upended -- so many of them identify themselves as Republicans,\" Booker said.",
      "\"In just 71 days, the president of the United States has inflicted so much harm on Americans' safety, financial stability, the core foundations of our democracy and even our aspirations as a people [for] our highest offices, a sense of common decency,\" Booker said. \"These are not normal times in America. And they should not be treated as such.\"",
      "Over 24 hours hour, Booker's comments addressed a wide range of topics, including the Russia-Ukraine war, USAID relief in foreign countries, concerns about cuts to Medicaid and slashes to Social Security offices, among other issues.",
      "In addition to Thurmond's civil rights era filibuster, Booker's also bested two more recent marathon Senate floor talks. In 2013, Republican Sen. Ted Cruz spoke for 21 hours advocating for the defunding of Obamacare and, in 2016, Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy spoke for 15 hours pressing for action on gun violence.",
      "For the entirety of his marathon talk-a-thon, Booker occupied the small square of space surrounding his desk.",
      "Once the speech began, he did not sit down. He did not eat. On his desk, two glasses of water had been refilled at various points. On occasion, he leaned on the lectern, wiped his face with a handkerchief. But by the time the record was broken, Booker, who was wearing a black suit, had still not loosened his tie.",
      "\"I've got fuel in the tank man,\" Booker said during the 15-hour mark on Tuesday morning.",
      "He also read aloud letters that he said were from constituents and quoted speeches from figures such as the late Sen. John Lewis, who famously advocated for \"good trouble\" in the fight for justice and equality.",
      "As long Booker held the floor, the Senate has not been able to conduct other business unless he temporarily yields.",
      "He has been joined by Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and Democratic Sens. Lisa Blunt Rochester of Delaware, Chris Murphy of Connecticut, Andy Kim of New Jersey, Peter Welch of Vermont, Dick Durbin of Illinois, Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, Chris Coons of Delaware, Mark Warner of Virginia, Ed Markey of Massachusetts, Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and some others.",
      "Booker has entertained questions from the lawmakers, allowing him short breaks in speaking, but he's been careful to note that he's \"retaining the floor\" so as not to break his continuous hold according to Senate procedural rules. He's had to remain standing during these \"question\" periods.",

      "The affected voyage was a luxury Cunard Line ship traveling from Southampton, England, through New York and the Caribbean before returning to the United Kingdom, according to CruiseMapper.",
      "The ship, Cunard's Queen Mary 2, is scheduled to travel on this route for nearly a month, having departed on March 8 and set to return on April 6.",
      "The sweeping norovirus outbreak was reported to the CDC on March 18, according to the agency.",
      "In response to the outbreak, the ship and crew increased cleaning and disinfection procedures, collected stool specimens for testing and isolated people who had fallen ill, the CDC said.",
      "Norovirus is a very contagious virus that causes vomiting and diarrhea and is commonly referred to as the \"stomach flu\" or the \"stomach bug,\" according to the CDC.",
      "It is the leading cause of foodborne illness in the United States. Other symptoms may include stomach pain, fever, headache, body aches or dehydration, according to the CDC.",
      "The virus is also quite common, especially on ships. There have been 12 GI outbreaks on cruise ships in 2025, so far, according to the CDC.",
      "According to the federal health agency, every year the norovirus causes between 19 and 21 million illnesses, 109,000 hospitalizations and 900 deaths.",
      "A person can become infected by having direct contact with someone who is infected and sharing food or utensils with them; touching surfaces or objects contaminated with norovirus and then touching their face or mouth; or consuming contaminated foods or liquids.",
      "Typically, an infected person will develop symptoms between 12 to 48 hours after being infected. However, norovirus typically resolves quickly and, in most healthy adults, lasts one to three days, according to the CDC.",
      "There is no specific medication or antiviral for norovirus, meaning the only treatment available is managing symptoms.",
      "The CDC recommends staying hydrated and drinking liquids that replenish electrolytes, which can be depleted through diarrhea and vomiting.",
      "Washing hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds is one of the best ways to prevent spread. To prevent contamination from food, make sure fruits and vegetables are washed, and that shellfish is cooked to at least an internal temperature of 145 F.",

      "The election could set the ideological balance of Wisconsin's highest court.",
      "Voters in Wisconsin are having their say in a hot-button race that could offer a barometer on how Americans are feeling at this point in President Donald Trump's second term.",
      "Republican-backed Waukesha County Judge Brad Schimel and Democratic-backed Dane County Judge Susan Crawford are the candidates in Tuesday's marquee state Supreme Court race, which is technically nonpartisan -- but it has become the center of a political firestorm, as well as the target of millions spent by groups linked to tech billionaire and key Trump adviser Elon Musk.",
      "Schimel said he was feeling confident after voting in Genesee on Tuesday morning.",
      "\u201cI think we're going to be successful. I can't believe the energy we've seen on the campaign trail. I've never seen it like this. Every rally, every event we go, the people are so excited. They're turning out in droves\u2026 We're going to win this, and, looking forward to restoring objectivity to the Wisconsin Supreme Court, like I've promised all along.\u201d",
      "After voting in Madison, Crawford told reporters she feels the sheer attention on the race was a sign of its importance, and that Musk\u2019s involvement has been \u201cundemocratic\u201d.",
      "\"I think that the interest in the race is just a sign of how important our courts are right now,\u201d she said.",
      "Asked what it would mean if Musk\u2019s efforts worked, Crawford said, \u201cWell, I think it'll be a sad day for democracy\u2026 but I'm pretty confident that voters are going to see through those tactics, and that we will have a successful day.\u201d",
      "The election will determine which of the candidates, vying to replace retiring Justice Ann Walsh Bradley, will help determine the ideological bent of the court, which currently leans liberal.",
      "\"This is playing out like a presidential-style election. You turn on your TV, any local broadcast station here across the state of Wisconsin, you are inundated with political-type ads for what is technically a nonpartisan judicial race, but this is a full-on political race \u2026 this is becoming a true litmus test for the first 100 days of the Trump administration,\" Matt Smith, political director at Milwaukee's ABC affiliate WISN-TV, told ABC News Live anchor Diane Macedo last week.",
      "Independent voter Eric Sams voted for Trump in November but said he voted for Crawford.",
      "\"I believe that women's rights are issues. Even Trump says it's a state issue. If you're going to make it a state issue, then our state needs to have access for women to be able to have access to reproductive rights,\" Sams said.",
      "Dwayne Heulse also voted for Trump, but said the president's endorsement of Schimel didn't matter.",
      "\"I don't care who Trump supports,\" he said. \"I will go after the guy who I think is the best, and that's what I look at first. He can support the man on the moon, but I'm not going to vote for him unless I feel that this is a person who is going to meet the qualities I want, especially as a judge.\"",
      "Asked Tuesday about the national attention on the race, Schimel said, \u201cIf you told me six months ago that this was what was going to be happening, I I would not have believed it. But here we are, and you know, you just have to keep your head down. I've been running for Wisconsin voters, it's been a -- I've run a 72-county race.\u201d",
      "The winner of this race will join the bench as the court potentially grapples with key voter issues such as abortion access and redistricting. For example, there is a Wisconsin Supreme Court case regarding if the Wisconsin Constitution protects the right to an abortion, which the court might consider after the new justice is seated.",
      "The race could also preview how voters in the battleground state feel a few months into Trump's second term -- especially as Musk and his work with the federal government through the Department of Government Efficiency becomes a key issue given his groups' investments in the race.",
      "Musk continued to push the idea that the Wisconsin election matters because of how potential redistricting cases could impact the balance of power in the House of Representatives. He claimed to Fox News without offering proof that if the conservative candidate loses, Republicans could lose their majority in the House because Wisconsin's congressional districts would be redrawn.",
      "\"Well, the reason tonight's elections are so important is that the judge race will decide whether the Wisconsin district, districts get redrawn. They're kind of trying to gerrymander Wisconsin to remove two Republican seats. And as you know, the -- the House is currently Republican by a razor thin margin, which means that losing this judge race has good chance of causing Republicans to lose control of the House,\" Musk said.",
      "The justice elected won\u2019t take office and order districts to be redrawn, however. The court could revisit congressional districts if the issue comes before the court in a case.",
      "\"That is why it is so significant, and whichever party controls the House, to a significant degree, controls the country which then steers the course of Western civilization,\" Musk said at a high-profile town hall on Sunday in Green Bay.",
      "On Sunday, the tech billionaire also controversially gave away two $1 million checks to attendees at a rally in his latest effort to support Schimel.",
      "Schimel, the candidate backed by Republicans, is a former state attorney general and a circuit court judge in Waukesha County. He has received almost $20 million in support (such as spending for TV ads) as of Monday from groups linked to Musk, per a tally by the Brennan Center for Justice.",
      "Schimel has also received endorsements from Trump, Musk, Donald Trump Jr., and other key conservative figures.",
      "Schimel has welcomed the conservative support, yet said at a rally last week that he would treat any case fairly, including if it was a case brought by Trump.",
      "However, Crawford and her allies have alleged he would not treat cases involving Trump or Musk fairly, and she has made Musk a main target of her campaign.",
      "Schimel, asked on Thursday by ABC affiliate WISN to share his closing argument ahead of the final days in the race, said, \"My closing argument is that people need to take this race seriously. So much is at stake. We have to restore objectivity to this court right now ... We have to put the court back in its proper role where it's not making the law. It's not going through a political agenda. It is applying the law the way the legislature writes it, to the facts of the case.\"",
      "Crawford, backed by Democrats, is a Dane County circuit court judge and a former private attorney. At points, she represented Democratic-aligned groups such as Planned Parenthood, an organization supporting abortion access.",
      "Major liberal donors such as Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker and Democratic donor George Soros have given money to the Wisconsin Democratic Party, and the state party has donated $2 million to Crawford. The national Democratic Party has also invested in the race. She also has the endorsements of former President Barack Obama and former Vice President Kamala Harris.",
      "Crawford told WISN that her closing argument was about an impartial court: \"It's about making sure that we have a Supreme Court that is fair and impartial in interpreting our laws to protect the rights of Wisconsinites. The other choice is an extreme partisan, someone who is selling out to special interests, has a long history of doing that, and has now tied himself to Elon Musk.\"",
      "According to the Brennan Center for Justice, as of Monday, more than $90 million has been spent in the race -- making it the most expensive judicial election in the nation's history. That amount includes more than $49 million spent by Schimel or groups supporting him, and more than $40 million spent by Crawford or groups supporting her.",
      "The nonprofit says that the previous record for spending in a state supreme court race was in Wisconsin's 2023 state supreme court election, when $56 million was spent.",
      "Voters have taken notice. One Wisconsinite who voted early told WISN, \"There's a lot of outside money coming in, in our state. And I wanted to make sure that my voice is being represented and not other people.\"",
      "As of Monday, around 644,000 people in Wisconsin have voted early in person or by mail, according to the Wisconsin Elections Commission.",
      "Wisconsin will also vote on a ballot initiative over whether to enshrine requiring a photo ID to vote into the state constitution. Voter ID is already required by state law; enshrining it into the state constitution would not establish new requirements, but would likely make it harder to ever undo the law.",
      "Democratic groups and voting rights organizations have criticized the ballot initiative as potentially disenfranchising voters. Supporters of the initiative argue it will strengthen election security in Wisconsin and is cementing a requirement that has already been in place.",
      "A Marquette University Law School poll taken in late February also found that a majority of registered voters in Wisconsin support photo ID for voting, and separately, a majority of registered voters in Wisconsin said they would support the ballot initiative.",

      "The filing is part of a new lawsuit filed by Abrego Garcia's attorneys who are requesting that the government of El Salvador return him to the U.S. after being sent there \"because of an administrative error.\"",
      "Abrego Garcia's attorneys said that he \"is not a member of or has no affiliation with Tren de Aragua, MS-13, or any other criminal or street gang\" and said that the U.S. government \"has never produced an iota of evidence to support this unfounded accusation.\"",
      "In response to the error, the government has acknowledged the error but said in a filing that because Abrego Garcia is no longer in U.S. custody, the court cannot order him to be returned to the U.S. nor can the court order El Salvador to return him.",
      "According to Abrego Garcia's attorneys, in 2019, a confidential informant \"had advised that Abrego Garcia was an active member\" of the gang MS-13. He later filed an I-589 application for asylum and although Abrego Garcia was found removable, an immigration judge \"granted him withholding of removal to El Salvador.\"",
      "But earlier this month, Abrego Garcia was stopped by ICE officers who \"informed him that his immigration status had changed.\" After being detained over gang affiliations, he was transferred to a detention center in Texas. He was then sent to El Salvador on March 15.",
      "\"Abrego Garcia, a native and citizen of El Salvador, was on the third flight and thus had his removal order to El Salvador executed,\" said Robert L. Cerna, acting field office director for ICE in a sworn declaration. \"This removal was an error.\"",
      "In response, the government said Abrego Garcia had the opportunity to present evidence to show he was not a part of MS-13. \"Abrego Garcia had a full and fair opportunity to litigate the issue,\" the government said. \"He had the opportunity to give evidence tending to show he was not part of MS-13, which he did not proffer.\"",
      "Vice President JD Vance said in a statement on X that Abrego Garcia was a \"convicted MS-13 gang member with no legal right\" to be in the U.S. Vance added that \"it's gross to get fired up about gang members getting deported while ignoring citizens they victimize.\"",
      "In the filing, Yaakov M. Roth Acting Assistant Attorney General Civil Division for the Department of Justice said the court lacks jurisdiction to review the removal of Abrego Garcia and said that the plaintiffs are seeking his release from Salvadoran custody by \"financial pressure and diplomacy.\"",
      "Roth also added in the filing that there is no clear showing that \"Abrego Garcia himself is likely to be tortured or killed in CECOT.\"",
      "\"While there may be allegations of abuses in other Salvadoran prisons -- very few in relation to the large number of detainees -- there is no clear showing that Abrego Garcia himself is likely to be tortured or killed in CECOT,\" Roth said. \"More fundamentally, this Court should defer to the government's determination that Abrego Garcia will not likely be tortured or killed in El Salvador.\"",
      "In the sworn declaration, Cerna said the removal was \"carried out in good faith.\"",
      "\"This was an oversight, and the removal was carried out in good faith based on the existence of a final order of removal and Abrego Garcia's purported membership in MS-13,\" Cerna said.",

      "Trump is urging Republican senators to keep Canadian tariffs in place.",
      "President Donald Trump on Tuesday called on the Senate to keep the United States' tariffs on Canada in place -- hours before Democrats in the upper chamber could potentially force a vote aimed at blocking the president from imposing tariffs on the ally country.",
      "Democratic Sens. Tim Kaine, Amy Klobuchar and Mark Warner are leading the effort to end the international emergency -- which Kaine has called a \"made-up emergency\" -- that Trump has declared against Canada, thereby shunting his administration's authority to unilaterally impose tariffs. Trump has derived his authority to impose tariffs by declaring a national emergency caused by the flow of fentanyl and undocumented migration from Canada, Mexico and China. But Democrats are now challenging that emergency status.",
      "\"President Trump is saying that there is an emergency with Canada. Canada is a friend not an adversary. Canada is a sovereign nation not a 51st state,\" Kaine said on Tuesday.",
      "It comes just one day before Trump's tariffs on Canada are expected to go into effect as part of \"Liberation Day\" -- the president's plans to roll out sweeping tariffs that he has said will impact \"all countries.\"",
      "On Tuesday, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney vowed to respond with retaliatory tariffs if Trump slaps additional levies on Canadian goods as part of Wednesday's expected tariff announcement.",
      "Trump said in a social media post that the U.S. is \"making progress to end this terrible Fentanyl Crisis\" that he claims is coming from Canada, and said that \"Republicans in the Senate MUST vote to keep the National Emergency in place, so we can finish the job, and end the scourge.\"",
      "During a press conference on Tuesday, Democrats argued that Trump is falsely imposing an emergency in order to give cover for the tariffs with hopes of raising revenue to pay for his tax cut plan. That's why they say this vote is so important.",
      "Trump criticized Kaine for his role in the effort to block tariffs.",
      "\"Don't let the Democrats have a Victory. It would be devastating for the Republican Party and, far more importantly, for the United States,\" Trump wrote.",
      "Unlike most legislation in the Senate, this resolution will only need a simple majority of votes to pass, and it very likely may. Only a handful of Republicans would be needed to hit that threshold.",
      "But there is nothing compelling the House, controlled by Republicans, to take up the legislation, and it's almost certain that House Speaker Mike Johnson would stay far away from the resolution.",
      "The Senate vote could get pushed to Wednesday as Sen. Cory Booker continues a filibuster he started at 7 p.m. Monday night. Booker is protesting against the national \"crisis\" he said Trump and Elon Musk created.",
      "A number of Republicans have expressed skepticism about Canadian tariffs and now find themselves in a difficult place of having to choose whether to block Trump's authority or cast a vote to try to forestall the tariffs.",
      "Majority Leader John Thune said Monday that he's unsure whether they'll be able to defeat the resolution.",
      "\"We'll see,\" he said. \"Obviously, as you know, and I'm among these, there is concerns about tariffs on Canada and, you know, what the ultimate objective is. If it's about fentanyl and stopping the drug trade, drug war, that's an issue obviously that there is a lot of interest. Obviously we want to give the president as much latitude as possible to deal with specific problems like that, but as you know, I'm in a very different place when it comes to across-the-board tariffs and Canada.\"",
      "Thune said on Tuesday that he hopes \"we'll have the votes.\"",
      "\"The president declared the emergency to deal with the issue of fentanyl -- flow of fentanyl into this country, not only from our southern border, but also from our north. That's what the emergency declaration is about. And what this would do is undo that,\" he said. \"I think the president needs to have tools at his disposal to deal with what I think are national emergencies. And certainly, you know, the tens of thousands of people that are killed in this country every year, because fentanyl represents that. So I hope we'll have the votes.\"",

      "\"We are making progress to end this terrible Fentanyl Crisis, but Republicans in the Senate MUST vote to keep the National Emergency in place,\" Trump said in a post on Truth Social.",
      "Since September, nearly all fentanyl seized by the U.S. came through the Southern border with Mexico, according to U.S. Customs and Border Patrol, or CBP. Less than 1% of fentanyl was seized at the Northern border with Canada, CBP found.",
      "The Trump administration last month imposed 25% tariffs on some goods from Canada. Initially, the tariffs applied to all Canadian goods, but a day later Trump issued a carve-out for goods compliant with the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, or USMCA, a free trade agreement.",
      "In response to U.S. tariffs, Canada slapped a 25% retaliatory duty on $30 billion worth of goods and pledged additional measures.",

      "Whatever the tariffs might be, the Trump administration believes they will have an overall positive effect on the U.S. economy, including preventing other countries from \"ripping off\" the U.S. The administration has also insisted that tariffs will boost domestic industries and jobs, by convincing companies to manufacture in the U.S. rather than importing goods from overseas.",

    "summary": "\"Trump may not want to rule out a third term but the 22nd Amendment to the Constitution does,\" one expert told ABC News.",
    "story": [
      "One told ABC \"there is no constitutional basis\" for what Trump is proposing.",
      "President Donald Trump has often mused, even joked, about seeking a third term, but over the weekend he made his strongest and most serious comments yet on a move that constitutional scholars ABC News spoke with call virtually impossible.",
      "\"I'm not joking,\" he told NBC News \"Meet the Press\" moderator Kristen Welker in a phone interview on Sunday, before adding it was \"far too early to think about it.\"",
      "\"There are methods which you could do it,\" Trump said, including a scenario in which Vice President JD Vance ran at the top of the 2028 ticket with Trump as his running mate, only for Trump to assume the Oval Office after the election.",
      "Legal and election experts told ABC News any attempt to win another four years as president would be an unprecedented breach of the Constitution.",
      "\"Trump may not want to rule out a third term but the 22nd Amendment to the Constitution does,\" said David Schultz, a professor at Hamline University and an expert in constitutional law.",
      "The amendment states, in part: \"No person shall be elected to the office of the president more than twice.\"",
      "It was ratified in 1951, years after President Franklin D. Roosevelt broke with the two-term tradition set by George Washington and secured a third term as World War II was breaking out.",
      "\"It would be completely unprecedented for a president to openly defy the dictates of the 22nd Amendment and, even more so, to attempt to run or serve again as president,\" said Michael Gerhardt, a constitutional expert at the University of North Carolina.",
      "\"The threats and insinuations no doubt thrill his base, but there is no constitutional basis for the current president to try to serve as president after two elected terms,\" Gerhardt said.",
      "The only way legal way for Trump to be able to run for a third term, experts said, would be to amend the Constitution -- an incredibly unlikely outcome as it would take two-thirds of both the House and Senate, or two-thirds of the states agreeing to call a constitutional convention. Then, any change would require three-fourths of the states to sign on for ratification.",
      "\"This statement by Trump was brilliant in terms of capturing and diverting attention,\" said Schultz. \"His supporters love it and his detractors will rage over it. In the process, no one will talk about the price of eggs, tariffs and a shaky stock market.\"",
      "Experts break down 'methods' floated by Trump and his allies",
      "As for Trump's claim that one of the \"methods\" could be to run as Vance's vice president and then be passed the baton, experts point to the 12th Amendment from 1804 as a barrier.",
      "\"The 12th Amendment states that anyone who is ineligible to be president is also deemed to be illegible to serve as vice president,\" said Barry Burden, the director of the Elections Research Center at University of Wisconsin-Madison. \"This means that Trump could not serve as vice president, which is the post he would need for the Vance scheme to be executed.\"",
      "Steve Bannon, a fierce Trump ally, has also floated what he's called alternatives to allow Trump to run in 2028.",
      "Bannon, in remarks at the New York Young Republican Club gala in December, has argued that he could run again as Trump's two terms in office were not consecutive.",
      "\"Since it doesn't actually say consecutive, I don't know, maybe we do it again in '28? Are you guys down for that? Trump '28?\" Bannon said.",
      "Schultz said that argument doesn't have a sound legal basis.",
      "\"The overall limit of serving as president for ten years is both textual proof on the bar to run for a third term and an indication of the intent of the congressional drafters that they did not want anyone serving for more than two terms,\" Schultz said.",
      "Section 1 of the 22nd Amendment states: \"no person who has held the office of President, or acted as President, for more than two years of a term to which some other person was elected President shall be elected to the office of the President more than once.\"",
      "Schultz added that measure \"was put into place to allow for a situation where a president dies more than halfway into a term and the vice president succeeds that person. The Constitution thereby allows for the vice president to serve out the remaining term and then serve two more terms, for a total of ten years.\"",
      "What happens if Trump tries anyway?",
      "Trump has already tested the bounds of the Constitution governing presidential power several times in the first months of his second term.",
      "Several Democrats viewed his comments on Sunday as another escalation against the rule of law. Democratic National Committee Chair Ken Martin wrote on X: \"This is what dictators do.\"",
      "In the past, Republicans have largely played off Trump's musings about a third term as a joke intended to rile his opposition. But just days after his inauguration, Republican hardliner Rep. Andy Ogles introduced a resolution calling for the extension of presidential term limits to allow Trump to seek another four years in the White House.",
      "\"A crisis could arise if Trump runs for president or vice president in 2028,\" Burden said. \"The Constitution prohibits serving in office but not running for office. If Republicans nominated him, they would be betting that they can violate the Constitution and somehow allow him to serve if he wins.\"",
      "If Trump attempted to run, it would be up to election officials and then ultimately the courts to decide. In the 2024 campaign, several states challenged Trump's eligibility to seek the Republican presidential nomination under Section 3 of the 14th Amendment due to his actions around the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol. The legal battle went to the Supreme Court, which ruled in Trump's favor.",
      "\"If an ineligible person such as Trump is permitted to run knowing that he is not eligible to serve, it is a dangerous collision course in which the U.S. Constitution and the rule of law would be seriously tested,\" Burden said.",
      "James Sample, a constitutional law expert at Hofstra University, said Trump would lose in court should he attempt to run again.",
      "\"Most of the Constitution is written in broad, textured, difficult to define terms. What is a speedy trial? What is cruel and unusual punishment? What is equal protection? How much process is due process? The 22nd Amendment, however, is black and white,\" Sample said.",
      "\"But if you can succeed in turning questions that are that clear-cut into debates, then the overall goal of undermining the Constitution and undermining the rule of law and maximizing executive power is served even if you lose the particular battle,\" he continued. \"This particular battle is not a winnable battle. He is not going to serve a third term, but merely by framing this as a debate, he will succeed in further eroding respect for the Constitution.\"",

That vested this Court with jurisdiction. The Court's jurisdiction is not defeated by the Petitioner having been moved to Louisiana,\" Judge Michael Fabiarz wrote in a 67-page opinion on Tuesday.",
      "The opinion, unless appealed by the government, would clear the way for Fabiarz to decide the more substantive issues of Khalil's continued confinement.",
      "Khalil, a leader of the encampment protests at Columbia last spring, was detained on March 8 at his student apartment building in New York. He was taken to 26 Federal Plaza in lower Manhattan, then to an immigration detention facility in Elizabeth, New Jersey, before ending up in a Louisiana detention center, his attorneys said.",
      "After his lawyers filed a petition for Khalil's immediate release, a federal judge in New York last month moved the case to New Jersey.",
      "Lawyers for Khalil urged a federal judge to keep his habeas case in New Jersey to prevent the government from a \"Kafka-esque\" moving of Khalil from one detention facility to another.",
      "\"We are grateful the court wisely understood that the government cannot try to manipulate the jurisdiction of the United States courts in a transparent attempt to shield their unconstitutional -- and frankly chilling -- behavior,\" Baher Azmy, an attorney for Khalil, said in a statement on Tuesday. \"We look forward to the next phase of this case, which is to get Mahmoud out of detention and into the arms of his family, and then to prove the Trump administration's attempted deportation of Mahmoud and others is nothing but unconstitutional retaliation for protected speech.\"",
      "New Jersey is also closer to Khalil's wife, who is about to give birth.",
      "\"I am relieved at the court's decision today to keep my husband's ongoing case in New Jersey,\" his wife, Noor Abdalla, said in a statement Tuesday. \"This is an important step towards securing Mahmoud's freedom, but there is still a lot more to be done. As the countdown to our son's birth begins and I inch closer and closer to my due date, I will continue to strongly advocate for Mahmoud's freedom and for his safe return home so he can be by my side to welcome our first child.\"",
      "During a hearing on Friday over whether the case should remain in New Jersey, Azmy told the judge there is a \"prohibition on forum shopping\" to find a court that might be most sympathetic to the government's position.",
      "Outside court, Azmy said the government is simply trying to delay the adjudication of the actual legality of Khalil's detention.",
      "An attorney for the government, August Flentje, argued that \"for jurisdictional certainty, the case belongs in Louisiana\" because that is where Khalil is being held.",
      "\"The clearest route is to have the case heard in Louisiana,\" Flentje said during Friday's hearing.",
      "After deciding on the jurisdictional question, the judge can now consider the substantive question of whether the detention of Khalil, a green card holder, was lawful.",
      "Khalil is due to appear before an immigration judge for a removal proceeding on April 8.",
      "He is among a half-dozen international students who have supported Palestinians to be detained by the administration in recent weeks. No charges have been filed against any of them.",
      "The administration has argued the students' continued presence in the country undermines American foreign policy and revoked their status. Attorneys for the students have argued the administration is punishing them for lawful activity.",

      "LOS ANGELES -- As the deadline to strike a deal over TikTok approaches this week, President Donald Trump has signaled that he is confident his administration can broker an agreement with ByteDance, the social media app's China-based parent company.",
      "Speaking with reporters on Air Force One late Sunday, Trump said that \u201cthere\u2019s tremendous interest in Tiktok.\" He added that he would \u201clike to see TikTok remain alive.\u201d The president's comments came less than one week before an April deadline requiring ByteDance to divest or face a ban in the United States.",
      "\u201cWe have a lot of potential buyers,\u201d Trump said.",
      "Trump also said that the administration is \u201cdealing with China\u201d who \u201calso want it because they may have something to do with it.\u201d Last week, Trump said he would consider a reduction in tariffs on China if that country\u2019s government approves a sale of TikTok\u2019s operations in the U.S.",
      "Questions about the fate of the popular video sharing app have continued to linger since a law requiring ByteDance\u2019s divestment took effect on Jan. 19. After taking office, Trump gave TikTok a 75-day reprieve by signing an executive order that delayed enforcement of the statute until April 5.",
      "During his first term, Trump tried to ban TikTok on national security grounds, which was halted by the courts before his administration negotiated a sale of the platform that eventually failed to materialize. He changed his position on the popular app during last year\u2019s presidential election and has credited the platform with helping him win more young voters.",
      "\u201cI won the young vote by 36 points. Republicans generally don't do very well with the young vote,\u201d he said Sunday. \u201cI think a lot of it could have been TikTok.\u201d",
      "Trump has said that the deadline on a TikTok deal could be extended further if needed. He previously proposed terms in which the U.S. would have a 50% stake in a joint venture. The administration hasn\u2019t provided details on what that type of deal would entail.",
      "TikTok and ByteDance have not publicly commented on the talks. It\u2019s also unclear if ByteDance has changed its position on selling TikTok, which it said early last year it does not plan to do.",
      "If TikTok is not sold to an approved buyer by April 5, the original law that bans it nationwide would once again go into effect. However, the deadline for the executive order doesn\u2019t appear to be set in stone and the president has reiterated it could be extended further if needed.",
      "Trump\u2019s order came a few days after the Supreme Court unanimously upheld a federal law that required ByteDance to divest or be banned in January. The day after the ruling, TikTok went dark for U.S. users and came back online after Trump vowed to stall the ban.",
      "During his first term, Trump tried to ban TikTok on national security grounds, which was halted by the courts before his administration negotiated a sale of the platform that eventually failed to materialize. He changed his position on the popular app during last year\u2019s presidential election and has credited the platform with helping him win more young voters.",
      "The decision to keep TikTok alive through an executive order has received some scrutiny, but it has not faced a legal challenge in court.",
      "Although it\u2019s unclear if ByteDance plans to sell TikTok, several potential bidders have come forward in the past few months.",
      "Aides for Vice President JD Vance, who was tapped to oversee a potential deal, have reached out to some parties, such as the artificial intelligence startup Perplexity AI, to get additional details about their bids, according to a person familiar with the matter. In January, Perplexity AI presented ByteDance with a merger proposal that would combine Perplexity\u2019s business with TikTok\u2019s U.S. operation.",
      "Other potential bidders include a consortium organized by billionaire businessman Frank McCourt, which recently recruited Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian as a strategic adviser. Investors in the consortium say they\u2019ve offered ByteDance $20 billion in cash for TikTok\u2019s U.S. platform. And if successful, they plan to redesign the popular app with blockchain technology they say will provide users with more control over their online data.",
      "Jesse Tinsley, the founder of the payroll firm Employer.com, says he too has organized a consortium, which includes the CEO of the video game platform Roblox, and is offering ByteDance more than $30 billion for TikTok.",
      "Trump said in January that Microsoft was also eyeing the popular app. Other interested parties include Trump\u2019s former Treasury secretary Steve Mnuchin and Rumble, the video site popular with some conservatives and far-right groups. In a post on X last March, Rumble said it was ready to join a consortium of parties interested in purchasing TikTok and serving as a tech partner for the company.",

      "NEW YORK -- Gadgets sold without batteries. Toys sold in slimmed-down boxes or no packaging at all. More household goods that shoppers need to assemble themselves.",
      "These are some of the ways consumer product companies are retooling their wares to reduce costs and avoid raising prices as President Donald Trump levies new import taxes on key trading partners as well as some materials used by American manufacturers.",
      "The economic environment in which the president has imposed, threatened and occasionally postponed repeated rounds of tariffs is more precarious than during his first term. U.S. consumers are feeling tapped out after several years of inflation. Businesses say tariffs add to their expenses and eat into their profits, but they are wary of losing sales if they try to pass all of the increase on to customers.",
      "Instead, some companies are exploring cost-cutting options, both ones that consumers likely would notice in time \u2014 remember \u201cshrinkflation?\u201d \u2014 and ones that exist too far down the supply chain for them to see. The changes may help minimize price increases yet won't be enough in every case to offset them completely.",
      "These are some of the strategies retailers and brands have in mind:",
      "After putting an extra 20% tariff on all goods from China, as well as a 25% tariff on imported steel, aluminum and automobiles, Trump said he would announce on Wednesday the targets of \u201creciprocal tariffs\u201d that mirror the taxes all other nations apply to certain U.S. exports.",
      "He argues the tariffs will spur domestic manufacturing, among other goals.",
      "Also on the horizon: twice-delayed tariffs on most goods from Canada and Mexico, and duties on copper, lumber and pharmaceutical drugs.",
      "Kimberly Kirkendall, president of supply-chain consulting firm International Resource Development, has told clients \u2014 U.S. makers of shelving, home goods and food products \u2014 that given all the uncertainty, this is not the time for long-term moves like seeking factories outside of China.",
      "She encouraged them to focus on the short term, particularly the need to scrutinize product lines from every angle for possible savings.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019ve got to collaborate and work together with your suppliers in this situation to be able to bring costs down,\" Kirkendall said.",
      "Sourcing concerns are not only a worry for big companies that rely on Chinese manufacturers. Sasha Iglehart, founder of a small online clothing company called Shirt Story, has a collection of upcycled men\u2019s shirts that sell for around $235. She said she typically gets her vintage buttons from an Austrian supplier and knows Trump has talked about taxing goods from the European Union.",
      "\u201cI will continue to look for local vendors and collectors here in the States as back up,\u201d said Iglehart, whose company is based in Connecticut.",
      "For many companies, evaluating which components or details they can remove from their products or replace with less expensive ones is the go-to move for absorbing the potential financial hit from tariffs.",
      "Los Angeles-based toy company Abacus Brands Inc., which designs science kits and other educational toys, has most of its products made in China. By using slightly thinner paper in an 80-page project book that comes with two of its kits, the company expects to avert a $10 retail price increase, President Steve Rad said.",
      "\u201cThree or 4 cents here,\u201d Rad said. \u201cSeven or 6 cents there. Two more pennies over there. All of a sudden, you've made up the difference.\u201d",
      "Aurora World Inc., known for its plush pets and toy vehicles, is looking at using fewer paint colors as a way to counteract tariff costs, according to Gabe Higa, managing director of the California company's toy division. All of Aurora World's toys come from factories in China.",
      "\u201cThis is something that makes it a little bit simpler so that there\u2019s less manual labor involved or less material cost,\u201d Higa said. \u201c(It) doesn't have a lot of incremental value so it's easy to take away.\u201d",
      "The company still may have to raise prices as long as the new tariffs are in effect, he said.",
      "Tweaking or reducing product packaging is another area where importers may cut back and carries the advantage of possibly appealing to eco-conscious customers.",
      "Basic Fun CEO Jay Foreman, whose company markets classic toys like Tonka trucks, Lincoln Logs and Care Bears, said he is presenting retailers with three different packaging options and asking them to decide which ones they prefer for the trucks and some other products that will be in stores next spring.",
      "The first is the current packaging, which consists of a box with a big open window that lets customers see what's inside. The second option: no box, just a tray attached to the bottom of toys to hold them in place on shelves. The third: unwrapped but affixed with a simple paper price tag that features brand information.",
      "The second-tier packaging would reduce the toy company's cost per item by $1.25, and the package-free version would yield savings of $1.75, Foreman said. Both would diminish the appeal of the products and would not come close to canceling out the tariff on goods made in China, Foreman said.",
      "He said he would make pricing decisions later this week after Trump provides details about his planned reciprocal tariffs.",
      "To further reduce its production costs, Abacus Brands is thinking of switching from plastic to cardboard for the package inserts that keep toy parts in place. Cardboard trays cost 7 cents per unit compared to 30 cents for the plastic version, according to Rad.",
      "The change requires finding a new factory to make the inserts, a move that did not make financial sense before now, he said. The various tariff-related modifications should be effective for fall and holiday deliveries to stores, Rad said.",
      "\u201cThe compromises we\u2019re making are things that do not matter to the consumer,\u201d he said.",
      "Shoppers will likely have to assemble more of their products at home as companies look to reduce shipping costs, according to Kirkendall of International Resource Development.",
      "One of her clients manufactures self-watering planters that are made in China. The product is undergoing a redesign so it can be shipped as separate nesting components instead of fully assembled.",
      "Companies also are reevaluating the pieces of their products that are essential or extra. Chris Bajda, managing partner at online wedding gift retailer Groomsday, said accessories like batteries and decorative gift boxes may end up in the latter category.",
      "\u201cWe now carefully assess what\u2019s truly necessary and avoid including items that don\u2019t serve a functional purpose for the customer,\u201d Bajda said.",
      "Reducing the size or weight of products without lowering prices proliferated as a business practice from 2021 through 2024 as companies grappled with rising costs for ingredients, packaging, labor and transportation.",
      "Edgar Dworsky, a consumer advocate and former assistant attorney general in Massachusetts, suspects the makers of consumer goods will embrace shrinkflation again to hide costs given the blast of new tariffs. The additional import tax on Canadian soft lumber, for example, might show up in smaller toilet paper rolls, he said.",
      "\u201cShrinkflation has been a little quiet\u201d in the last few months, Dworksy said. \u201cBut I would expect to see both price increases and product shrinkage.\"",

      "The Supreme Court will hear arguments in a South Carolina case over whether states can cut off Medicaid funding to Planned Parenthood",
      "WASHINGTON -- There are just two Planned Parenthood clinics in South Carolina, but every year they take hundreds of low-income patients who need things like contraception, cancer screenings and pregnancy testing.",
      "The organization has long been at the center of the debate over abortion, but its clinics across the U.S. also provide a range of other services. In South Carolina, Medicaid patients often seek out Planned Parenthood because they often have difficulty finding a doctor who accepts the publicly funded insurance.",
      "A case coming before the Supreme Court from South Carolina on Wednesday could upend that option. That's because the state's Republican governor, Henry McMaster, is pushing to block any public health care dollars from going to Planned Parenthood.",
      "Federal law already prohibits Medicaid money from going to pay for abortions, with very limited exceptions, and South Carolina now bans almost all abortions around six weeks after conception.",
      "\u201cThis case is not about abortion. This case is about general health care,\u201d said Katherine Farris, chief medical officer at Planned Parenthood South Atlantic.",
      "Still, Republican leaders in conservative-led states have long said that no public health care dollars should go to an organization that provides abortions, and states should instead be able to direct that money as they choose. A few states already have cut Medicaid funding to Planned Parenthood and more could follow if South Carolina prevails.",
      "\u201cThe people in this state do not want their tax money to go to that organization,\u201d McMaster said.",
      "The Trump administration is joining South Carolina for the arguments on Wednesday, which are playing out against the backdrop of a wider push by abortion opponents to defund Planned Parenthood.",
      "Health care advocates, meanwhile, say the effects of the case transcend abortion. The legal question at its center is whether Medicaid patients can sue over their legal right to choose their own qualified provider.",
      "The American Cancer Society and other public-health groups say in court papers that lawsuits are the only real way that patients can assert those rights. Losing the ability to go to court would hurt their access to care, especially in rural areas.",
      "\u201cIf no one is able to enforce the statute or no one\u2019s willing to enforce the statute at the federal level, then it\u2019s a right on paper only,\u201d said Julian Polaris, a lawyer who regularly advises state Medicaid programs and health care providers. States could also move to restrict access to treatments like gender-affirming care if the court sides with South Carolina, he said.",
      "One in five American women of reproductive age is now enrolled in the Medicaid program, said Heidi Allen, an associate professor at Columbia University. This means that finding providers who can offer quality family planning services \u2014 a requirement for Medicaid \u2014 is crucial for meeting the needs of those patients.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s concerning that states would eliminate a site of care for politically motivated reasons, \u201cAllen said.",
      "The case stretches back to 2018, before the Supreme Court overturned the nationwide right to abortion, when McMaster first moved to cut Planned Parenthood funding in a fulfillment of a campaign promise. He signed an executive order removing Planned Parenthood from a list of providers for things like birth control, and sexually transmitted disease testing.",
      "\u201cThere are plenty of good organizations that provide maternal health advice, counseling and care and we need more of those,\u201d McMaster said last week.",
      "His order was blocked in court, but since then judges have ruled in favor of similar moves in Texas and Missouri, said John Bursch, an attorney for the conservative group Alliance Defending Freedom.",
      "\u201cAt the highest level, this case is about whether states have the flexibility to direct Medicaid moneys to best benefit low-income women and families,\u201d he said.",
      "He acknowledged that a win for South Carolina could curtail other Medicaid lawsuits, but suggested that could be good for the program overall because it would mean less money going to legal fees. There is also an administrative appeals process available, he said.",
      "\u201cNo one is losing their access to health care clinics,\u201d Busch said. If the state is allowed to cut off Planned Parenthood, Medicaid patients could go to one of 200 other publicly funded health care clinics in the state, he said.",
      "In South Carolina, $90,000 in Medicaid funding goes to Planned Parenthood every year \u2014 a tiny fraction of a percentage point of the state\u2019s total Medicaid spending.",
      "Most counties in the state have already been federally designated as having too few primary care providers, said Amalia Luxardo, CEO of the South Carolina-based Women\u2019s Rights and Empowerment Network. Fourteen of the state\u2019s counties have no practicing OB-GYN physicians and five other counties have just one, she said, meaning many women already have to travel longer distances to find the right provider.",
      "Planned Parenthood has flexible hours and can get appointments scheduled quickly, factors that bring in patients from around the state, she said.",
      "\u201cWe are already in a health care crisis,\u201d said Luxardo, whose group has filed court briefs supporting Planned Parenthood. \u201cAnd when decisions like these negatively impact our constituents, the crisis is going to only increase.\u201d",

      "\u201cHaiti is getting worse. We don\u2019t have a home to go back to,\u201d Jean said. \u201cWhen you pray, when you come to Mass, it helps you to keep moving.\u201d",
      "Notre Dame d'Haiti was founded nearly 50 years ago as a mission of the Catholic Church in Little Haiti, a neighborhood near downtown Miami that grew as people fled waves of turmoil. About half a million Haitians live in Florida, making greater Miami by far their largest home away from home.",
      "\u201cNotre Dame d'Haiti is the point of rallying of this community,\u201d said the Rev. Reginald Jean-Mary, who has led the parish since 2004. \u201cWe accompany Haitian migrants to integrate in U.S. life.\u201d",
      "Today, their greatest need is a sense of peace.",
      "\u201cPeople are very desperate, broken, hopeless and at the same time, they continue to believe,\" Jean-Mary said.",
      "The gangs that control the vast majority of Haiti\u2019s capital, Port-au-Prince, have stepped up the attacks that have killed thousands of people across the country and left more than one million homeless. Sixty thousand were displaced in a single month \u2014 a record \u2014 according to a late March United Nations report.",
      "So growing numbers of Haitians have fled to the United States. More than 200,000 came under a \u201chumanitarian parole\u201d program created in late 2022 that the Department of Homeland Security said it would revoke in late April.",
      "Earlier this year, the U.S. government also announced that in August it would end \u201ctemporary protected status\u201d for about half a million Haitians. Their status had been renewed by the Biden administration, which had widely expanded that type of humanitarian visa.",
      "Some Notre Dame congregants felt that these new arrivals strained available resources \u2014 and voted for President Donald Trump, whose immigration policies have found support among many in Miami\u2019s long-established Latino communities, too.",
      "But most congregants are still stepping up to help their compatriots who often sold what little they had in Haiti to take advantage of legal protections in the United States, Jean Suffrant said. He leads the Pierre Toussaint Leadership and Learning Center, Notre Dame\u2019s social services hub, which offers free day care, job training, and language and tech classes.",
      "Last week, one immigration session \u2014 held by Catholic Legal Services on church grounds \u2014 lasted until 1 a.m. because so many people lined up, desperate for advice, Suffrant said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s never been this bad\u201d for Haitians in the U.S. and on the island, he said. \u201cWhat a heavy burden, being told you\u2019re no longer allowed in a country that welcomed you.\u201d",
      "Octavius Aime said the new arrivals\u2019 difficulties affect the entire community, which he\u2019s seen grow over 40 years at Notre Dame. Many are terrified to lose their work permits, which came with humanitarian protections, since their U.S. salaries are lifelines for families in Haiti.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re hurting,\u201d Aime said. \"We are so worried, we don\u2019t know what to do.\u201d",
      "The uncertainty makes it especially important to gather and uplift all Haitians at events like the revival, at which Aime volunteered. It centered on the biblical story of the Jewish people\u2019s miraculous escape from slavery in Egypt after Moses parted the Red Sea.",
      "The event\u2019s motto was that nobody can close a door opened by God \u2014 or \u201cBondye\u201d in Creole, which is derived from the French for \u201cgood God.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe all need it at this moment,\u201d Savio Magloire said of the biblical message as he and his fiancee watched Mass projected on a screen outside the packed church. A few folding chairs were set up under the palms.",
      "In normal times, the grounds would be full with the overflow crowd, but now many are too afraid because of their immigration status to be seen in public, said Sandra Monestime, who was sitting near Magloire.",
      "She\u2019s been coming to Notre Dame for more than 40 years, since she was a teen, and trusts that the intergenerational congregation with more than three dozen ministry groups will survive this latest period of turmoil because it\u2019s \u201clike family.\u201d",
      "Dressed in bright white with soft pink flourishes, a youth group called \u201cmimers\u201d \u2014 a Haitian tradition, they mime some of the liturgy through dance \u2014 led the Mass entrance processional. The children are both U.S.-born and new arrivals, coordinator Asencia Selmon said.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s what the church brings,\u201d Selmon said, of youth participation. \u201cWe help them to be involved in church, not only spiritually but socially. When the priests preach, they show people not to despair.\u201d",
      "That\u2019s the message that Helene Auguste, a parishioner for the past 40 years, tries to convey to her brother, a teacher in Haiti. Every time the phone rings, she fears it\u2019s with news he was killed in the escalating violence.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no life for the people of Haiti,\u201d Auguste said, adding only the power of prayer remains. \u201cNow you can\u2019t talk to any people, you speak to God.\u201d",
      "And speak \u2014 and sing, and dance \u2014 to God is just what the congregants of Notre Dame do.",
      "At the closing revival event, the faithful had lined up before 5 p.m. to enter the church \u2014 to get splashed, one by one, with holy water by a visiting Haitian priest. Eucharistic adoration followed, then a more than four-hour-long Mass and a reenactment of the ancient Israelites crossing the Red Sea to the promised land.",
      "That's when music surged, and the faithful jumped to their feet, singing, as the celebrating priests pumped fists, clapped and swung to the rhythm.",
      "Even the ushers, demurely dressed in white shirts, started rocking to the beat.",
      "\u201cIf you want a stronger faith, an energizer, you come here,\u201d Suzie Aristide, an usher, said. \u201cThen you get out and you\u2019re ready \u2014 your soul, your body, your mind. That\u2019s what we are: our faith.\u201d",

      "Oscar-winning filmmaker Oliver Stone is set to testify to Congress about thousands of newly released government documents surrounding the assassination of President John F. Kennedy",
      "Oscar-winning director Oliver Stone, whose 1991 film \u201cJFK\u201d portrayed President John F. Kennedy's assassination as the work of a shadowy government conspiracy, is set to testify to Congress on Tuesday about thousands of newly released government documents surrounding the killing.",
      "Scholars say the files that President Donald Trump ordered to be released showed nothing undercutting the conclusion that a lone gunman killed Kennedy. Many documents were previously released but contained newly removed redactions, including Social Security numbers, angering people whose personal information was disclosed.",
      "The first hearing of the House Task Force on the Declassification of Federal Secrets comes five decades after the Warren Commission investigation concluded that Lee Harvey Oswald, a 24-year-old former Marine, acted alone in fatally shooting Kennedy as his motorcade finished a parade route in downtown Dallas on Nov. 22, 1963.",
      "Republican Rep. Anna Paulina Luna of Florida, who chairs the task force, said last month that she wants to work with writers and researchers to help solve \u201cone of the biggest cold case files in U.S. history.\u201d Scholars and historians haven't viewed the assassination as a cold case, viewing the evidence for Oswald as a lone gunman as strong.",
      "Stone's \u201cJFK\u201d was nominated for eight Oscars, including best picture, and won two. It grossed more than $200 million but was also dogged by questions about its factuality.",
      "The last formal congressional investigation of Kennedy's assassination ended in 1978, when a House committee issued a report concluding that the Soviet Union, Cuba, organized crime, the CIA and the FBI weren't involved, but Kennedy \u201cprobably was assassinated as a result of a conspiracy.\u201d In 1976, a Senate committee said it had not uncovered enough evidence \u201cto justify a conclusion that there was a conspiracy.\u201d",
      "The Warren Commission, appointed by Kennedy's successor, President Lyndon B. Johnson, concluded that Oswald fired on Kennedy's motorcade from a sniper's perch on the sixth floor of the Texas School Book Depository, where Oswald worked. Police arrested Oswald within 90 minutes, and two days later, Jack Ruby, a nightclub owner, shot Oswald during a jail transfer broadcast on live television.",
      "For Tuesday's hearing, the task force also invited Jefferson Morley and James DiEugenio, who both have written books arguing for conspiracies behind the assassination. Morley is editor of the JFK Facts blog and vice president of the Mary Ferrell Foundation, a repository for files related to the assassination. He has praised Luna as being open to new information surrounding the killing.",

      "A handful of elections in Florida and Wisconsin have become key tests of President Donald Trump\u2019s political standing just over two months into his second term in the White House",
      "WASHINGTON -- Elections in Florida and Wisconsin have become key tests of President Donald Trump's political standing two months into his second White House term.",
      "The marquee race Tuesday is for a swing seat on the Wisconsin Supreme Court, a technically nonpartisan election that has drawn at least $90 million in spending. Trump and billionaire adviser Elon Musk are backing conservative judge Brad Schimel while progressive billionaires and Democrats support liberal Susan Crawford.",
      "Two Republican-friendly Florida congressional seats could give the GOP some breathing room in the narrowly divided chamber. But Democrats in both districts have far outraised their GOP counterparts, and national Republicans have been publicly concerned in particular about the race to replace Mike Waltz, now Trump's national security adviser.",
      "Here are the places to watch as the vote results are reported on election night:",
      "In any statewide election in Wisconsin, Democrats tend to win by large margins in the populous counties of Milwaukee and Dane (home of Madison). But the size of that win is usually a big factor in who wins statewide, especially in a close contest.",
      "In 2024, Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris carried Milwaukee with 68% of the vote and Dane with 75% while narrowly losing statewide. That same night, Democratic U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin ran about 2 percentage points ahead of Harris in both counties and narrowly won reelection.",
      "In 2023, the Democratic Party-backed Supreme Court candidate Janet Protasiewicz received 73% of the vote in Milwaukee and 82% of the vote in Dane and went on to win statewide by an 11-percentage-point margin.",
      "Republicans tend to do well in the suburban Milwaukee counties of Washington, Ozaukee and Waukesha \u2014 the so-called \u201cWOW\u201d counties. A strong Republican showing in these counties can help counter the Democratic advantage in urban areas. Republican candidates have carried all three counties in every major statewide election going back to at least 2016.",
      "Republican candidates tend to win Brown County, which is home to Green Bay, but not by huge blowouts. Trump carried the county in all three of his presidential campaigns with between 52% and 53% of the vote.",
      "But since the 2016 election, there have been two Democrats who carried Brown County and went on to win statewide: Tony Evers in his bid for governor in 2018 and more recently Protasiewicz in her 2023 state Supreme Court race.",
      "A Democrat can still win statewide without winning Brown (such as Democrat Joe Biden in 2020, Evers\u2019 reelection in 2022 and all three of Baldwin\u2019s U.S. Senate runs). But if they do carry Brown, it\u2019s probably going to be a rough night for Republicans.",
      "Sauk County, northwest of Madison, is a competitive area in statewide elections that usually ends up supporting the Democratic candidate, albeit by slim margins. It falls somewhere in the middle of Wisconsin\u2019s 72 counties in terms of population, and the margins are usually so small that statewide elections aren\u2019t typically won or lost in Sauk.",
      "Democrats or Democratic-backed candidates had a long winning streak in Sauk, having carried the county in eight of the last 10 major statewide elections. But the two exceptions are notable: Trump carried Sauk in 2016 and 2024, when he won Wisconsin and the White House.",
      "While Sauk won\u2019t likely place a decisive role in Tuesday\u2019s elections, a victory there by a Republican-backed candidate may be a good sign for the party statewide.",
      "Democrats are encouraged by the strong fundraising performances of their nominees to replace Waltz and former Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz, but the special elections take place in two congressional districts that have long been safe Republican territory.",
      "Trump received about 68% of the vote in 2024 in the Florida Panhandle\u2019s 1st Congressional District, slightly outperforming the 66% Gaetz received in his reelection bid. In the 6th Congressional District on the Atlantic coast, Trump received roughly 65% of the vote, just behind the 67% Waltz received in his final House reelection bid.",
      "The four counties that make up the 1st District have voted for Republican presidential candidates almost continually for the past 60 years. Only Walton County went for a Democrat on one occasion since 1960, although all four voted for Democrat-turned-independent candidate George Wallace in 1968. Today, the part of Walton County that falls within the 1st District is the most reliably Republican of the four counties.",
      "Republican presidential candidates have carried all six counties in the 6th District for the last four presidential elections. The Republican winning streak in some of the counties stretches back for decades before that. Lake County, for instance, hasn\u2019t supported a Democrat for president since Franklin Roosevelt in 1944. Trump and Waltz performed best in Putnam County, where they both received about 74% of the vote.",
      "If Democrats manage to pull off upsets in either the 1st or 6th districts, the first indications may be in their best performing counties.",
      "Given the Republican advantage in both districts, the Democrats' best areas are still places where Republicans performed well. In the 1st District, Trump and Gaetz did comparatively the worst in Escambia County, although they still received 59% and 57% of the county vote, respectively.",
      "In the 6th District, Democrats may do best in Volusia County, where Trump received 58% and Waltz received about 60%. Republican presidential candidates have carried Volusia in the last four elections, but the area used to be more friendly territory for Democrats, who won the county for six consecutive elections from 1992 through 2008.",

      "A committee in the California legislature plans to vote on bills Tuesday that would restrict transgender athletes from participating in girls sports",
      "SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- The battle over transgender athletes' participation in youth sports will come to California on Tuesday as state lawmakers debate two bills aimed at keeping trans kids and teens off sports teams consistent with their gender identity.",
      "One of the proposals would reverse a 2013 law allowing students to participate on a sex-segregated sports team that aligns with their gender identity, regardless of the gender listed on their records. The other would require the California Interscholastic Federation, the governing body for high school sports, to adopt rules banning students whose sex was assigned male at birth from participating on a girls school sports team.",
      "The Republican-backed bills are expected to draw a crowd to the state Assembly\u2019s Committee on Arts, Entertainment, Sports and Tourism hearing, where lawmakers in the Democrat-controlled legislature will decide whether to advance them. Conservative political commentator Matt Walsh and a student-athlete who says a trans runner took her spot on her high school's varsity cross country team are scheduled to testify in support of a ban.",
      "The hearing comes a day after Transgender Day of Visibility. It also comes weeks after Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom made waves and angered party allies when, speaking on his podcast, he questioned the fairness of transgender athletes participating in girls sports. Newsom hasn't directly called for a reversal of state law and generally does not comment on pending legislation.",
      "Democratic Assemblymember Chris Ward, the committee chair who leads the legislative LGBTQ+ caucus, said he hopes the hearing will \u201cprovide a balanced setting where both sides can present their arguments and engage in rational deliberation.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhether these bills advance or not, my hope is that after Tuesday\u2019s hearing, we can shift our focus back to real-life, pressing issues impacting Californians every day\u2014such as making the cost of living more affordable\u2014instead of furthering divisive culture wars,\u201d he said in a statement.",
      "At least 24 states have laws on the books barring transgender women and girls from participating in certain women\u2019s or girls sports competitions. Judges have temporarily blocked bans in Arizona, Idaho and Utah. In New Hampshire and West Virginia, students who sued those states over bans were allowed to compete.",
      "At the federal level, President Donald Trump signed an executive order last month aimed at barring transgender athletes from participating in girls and women's sports.",
      "The bans are part of a nationwide battle over transgender rights, with some states also imposing bans on gender-affirming care and requiring schools to share students\u2019 gender identity with parents without the students\u2019 consent.",
      "Education Secretary Linda McMahon weighed in on California's proposed ban. She sent Newsom a letter last week, saying his remarks on his podcast caught her attention and requesting he clarify his stance and support the bill that would reverse the 2013 law.",
      "\u201cTake a stand on your convictions,\u201d she wrote. \"Be clear about the harms of gender confusion. Protect female spaces. Do not encourage children to seek permanent medical interventions to their sex. Inform parents.\"",
      "The U.S. Department of Education also announced an investigation last week into the state education department over a law banning school districts from requiring teachers and staff to notify parents if a student changes their gender identity at school.",

      "The sanctions are expected to further escalate tensions between Washington and Beijing, who are already locked in friction over trade tariffs and other issues like Taiwan.",
      "\u201cBeijing and Hong Kong officials have used Hong Kong national security laws extraterritorially to intimidate, silence, and harass 19 pro-democracy activists who were forced to flee overseas, including a U.S. citizen and four other U.S. residents,\u201d the U.S. State Department said.",
      "The statement dated Monday said the six officials sanctioned were linked to entities or actions that engaged in coercing, arresting, detaining or imprisoning individuals under the authority of the city's security law, or implementing the law.",
      "The other three affected officials were Sonny Au, the secretary-general for the city's committee for safeguarding national security, and Dick Wong and Margaret Chiu, both assistant commissioners of the police.",
      "Since Beijing imposed a national security law in 2020 to quell the 2019 massive anti-government protests, Hong Kong authorities have prosecuted many leading activists in the former British colony, which returned to Chinese rule in 1997.",
      "The crackdown has drawn criticism from foreign governments, especially because the city was promised that its Western-style civil liberties and semi-autonomy would be kept intact for at least 50 years during the 1997 handover. Beijing and Hong Kong governments insist the law is necessary for the city\u2019s stability.",
      "Over the past two years, Hong Kong authorities have issued arrest warrants for 19 activists based overseas, with bounties of $1 million Hong Kong dollars ($128,536) for information leading to each of their arrests. The affected activists included former pro-democracy lawmakers Nathan Law and Ted Hui. They also canceled the passports of some of the overseas-based activists under a new security law introduced to the city last year.",
      "The Hong Kong office of China's foreign ministry condemned the sanctions, saying they again exposed the ill-intention of the U.S. to undermine the city's prosperity and contain China's development. It urged Washington to stop interfering in the city's affairs.",
      "\u201cChina will surely take effective countermeasures against these despicable acts by the U.S.!\u201d it said in a statement.",

      "The Hong Kong government strongly condemned the U.S. for the sanctions, saying it despises them and is not intimidated by them.",
      "\u201cIt, once again, clearly exposed the U.S.\u2019 barbarity under its hegemony, which is exactly the same as its recent tactics in bullying and coercing various countries and regions,\u201d it said in a statement.",
      "It said the \u201cabsconders\u201d mentioned by the U.S. government are wanted for arrest because they continued to blatantly engage in activities endangering national security overseas. It said the U.S. has given cover for those \u201cwho have committed these evil deeds,\" and therefore it was necessary for the city to take lawful measures to combat the acts.",
      "\u201cThe imposition of the so-called \u2018sanctions\u2019 in the guise of defending human rights and democracy indeed constitute a demonstration of shameless hypocrisy with double standards on the part of the U.S.,\u201d it said.",
      "Lam, the justice secretary, said the sanctions do not affect him. \u201cThey do not affect my work; they do not affect my life.\u201d",

      "Federal officials say a University of Minnesota student was detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement because of drunken driving, not student protests",
      "MINNEAPOLIS -- A University of Minnesota graduate student who was detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement was taken into custody because of a drunken driving infraction, not for being involved in protests, federal officials said Monday.",
      "\u201cThis is not related to student protests,\" Tricia McLaughlin, assistant secretary at the Department of Homeland Security, said in a statement. \"The individual in question was arrested after a visa revocation by the State Dept. related to a prior criminal history for a DUI.\u201d",
      "News of the student's detention \u2014 and the lack of an official explanation \u2014 sparked student protests and expressions of concern from university and political leaders. Gov. Tim Walz told reporters Monday that he spoke with Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem about it Friday and was still waiting for further details.",
      "Meanwhile, officials at Minnesota State University Mankato said Monday that one of their students had been detained by ICE as well.",
      "President Edward Inch said in a letter to the campus community that the student was detained Friday at an off-campus residence.",
      "\u201cNo reason was given. The University has received no information from ICE, and they have not requested any information from us,\u201d Inch wrote. \u201cI have contacted our elected officials to share my concerns and ask for their help in stopping this activity within our community of learners.\u201d",
      "The Mankato school did not name the student, nor give the student's nationality or field of study. ICE did not immediately respond to a request for details on that case.",
      "\u201cThis is becoming a deeply concerning pattern, where ICE detains students with little to no explanation ... and ignores their rights to due process,\u201d U.S. Sen. Tina Smith said in a statement. \u201cI will keep pressing the administration for answers about these arrests and work to get answers from federal immigration authorities about this case.\u201d",
      "The University of Minnesota has not named its student either.",
      "That student, who was detained at an off-campus residence on Thursday, was enrolled in the business school on the Minneapolis campus. University spokesperson Andria Waclawski said the school had no further updates Monday. She said earlier that they were following the lead of the student and respecting their request for privacy, while providing the student with legal aid and other supports.",
      "The governor said Monday that, \u201cA deep concern is, here, that no matter what the situation was, in this country, everyone has due process rights and our concern is whether those due process rights are being followed.\"",
      "President Donald Trump's administration has cited a seldom-invoked statute authorizing the secretary of state to revoke visas of noncitizens who could be considered a threat to foreign policy interests. More than half a dozen people with ties to universities are known to have been taken into custody or deported in recent weeks. Most of those detainees have shown support for Palestinian causes during campus protests over Israel's war in Gaza.",

      "NEW YORK -- Two New York City police officers have been suspended after being charged with burglary and forcibly touching a sex worker while responding to a complaint about an illegal brothel, prosecutors said Monday.",
      "Officers Justin McMillan and Justin Colon intentionally turned off their body cameras as they broke into a residential building, stole money and forcibly touched a woman while on duty last July, according to Queens District Attorney Melinda Katz.",
      "The patrol officers, who were still on probationary status after entering the police academy in 2023, had been responding to a report of prostitution inside the building.",
      "Prosecutors say the two shut off their bodycams before approaching a woman leaving the building and taking a key to the residence from her.",
      "They returned eight hours later, unlocked the door and found a woman having sex with a man, who immediately fled, according to Katz's office.",
      "McMillan then stole money from the woman's purse and groped her.",
      "The woman ran away and eventually called 911 with the help of others, prosecutors said. The officers, meanwhile, returned to their stationhouse without reporting the incidents.",
      "McMillan, 27, of Long Island, and Colon, 24, of Queens, pleaded not guilty during their arraignment hearings Monday in Queens. They were released and are due back in court April 28, according to Katz's office.",
      "They each face one count of forcible touching and petit larceny, two counts of burglary, and four counts of official misconduct.",
      "Lawyers for the two didn't immediately respond to messages seeking comment.",
      "The officers have been suspended without pay. They were placed on modified duty last August as the NYPD's internal affairs bureau and Katz's office investigated, according to police.",
      "\u201cWe hold our officers to the highest standard of professionalism and integrity, and failing to meet that standard is disqualifying,\" Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch said in a statement. \"Let me be perfectly clear: Any officer who violates their oath will be investigated, exposed, and held fully accountable. That standard will never change.\u201d",

      "Thomas Caldwell, a retired Navy intelligence officer, was tried alongside Oath Keepers founder Stewart Rhodes but acquitted of seditious conspiracy \u2014 the most serious charge brought in the Jan. 6 attack.",
      "Caldwell's pardon is dated March 20. Defense attorney David Fischer said he informed Caldwell of the pardon on Monday after learning about it from news reports.",
      "\u201cAnd he's elated,\u201d Fischer added.",
      "A jury convicted Caldwell of obstructing Congress and of obstructing justice for tampering with documents after the riot. One of those convictions was dismissed in light of a U.S. Supreme Court ruling last year.",
      "On Jan. 10, U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta sentenced Caldwell to time served with no supervised release. Prosecutors had recommended four years in prison for Caldwell.",
      "Ten days later, on his first day back in the White House, Trump issued a sweeping grant of clemency to all 1,500-plus people charged in the Capitol riot. Trump commuted the sentences of several defendants who were leaders and members of the Oath Keepers or Proud Boys extremist groups.",
      "More than a dozen defendants were convicted of seditious conspiracy for what prosecutors said were violent plots to keep Trump in power.",
      "Prosecutors had alleged at trial that Caldwell helped coordinate \u201cquick reaction force\u201d teams prosecutors said the Oath Keepers stationed outside the capital city to get weapons into the hands of extremists if they were needed. The weapons were never deployed, and lawyers for the Oath Keepers said they were only there for defensive purposes in case of attacks from left-wing activists.",
      "But Caldwell, who didn\u2019t enter the Capitol, took the witness stand and down played messages he sent leading up to Jan. 6, including one floating the idea about getting a boat to ferry \u201cheavy weapons\u201d across the Potomac River. Caldwell said he was never serious about it, calling it \u201ccreative writing.\u201d",
      "Fischer said his client was \u201cfirst among equals for a pardon.\u201d",

      "Two board members of the Institute of Peace have authorized replacing its temporary president with Nate Cavanaugh, the filing says.

      "The court filing asks U.S. District Judge Beryl Howell in Washington to stop the action or schedule a status conference to address the issues as soon as \u201cpracticable.\u201d",
      "The White House didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.",

      "Two former employees, who spoke to The Associated Press on the condition of anonymity for fear of retribution, said they were reached by private emails because they have been locked out of the institute's system and were not able to return to work since a tense standoff earlier this month in which DOGE members were accompanied by law enforcement. They were given until April 7 to clear out their personal effects.",
      "An executive order from the Republican president in February listed the institute, which seeks to prevent and resolve conflicts, and three other agencies for closure. Board members, who are nominated by the president and confirmed by the Senate, and the institute\u2019s president were fired. Later, there was a standoff between employees who blocked DOGE members from entering the institute\u2019s headquarters near the State Department. DOGE staff gained access in part with the help of the Washington police.",
      "Howell chastised DOGE representatives for their behavior but did not reinstate the board members or allow employees to return to the workspace.",
      "The court filing by plaintiffs acknowledges Howell's previous actions denying a temporary restraining order. \u201cThey seek relief now simply to preserve the status quo with regard to the Court's jurisdiction to grant relief if it determines that the removal of a vast majority of the Institute's directors was unlawful,\u201d it says.",

      "The women want to rebuild the diner loved by neighbors for its shrimp and grits, catfish, and Shay\u2019s secret house coffee blend. They knew they'd need help, but were surprised when Paris Hilton called to offer it to them.",
      "The Little Red Hen Coffee Shop is one of 50 women-owned businesses impacted by the Eaton Fire receiving a recovery grant of up to $25,000 from Hilton \u2019s nonprofit 11:11 Media Impact and GoFundMe.org.",
      "\u201cThese women are the backbone of their communities,\u201d the reality TV star said in a statement. \u201cThrough this powerful partnership, we\u2019re not just helping them rebuild \u2014 we\u2019re investing in their futures, their families, and their neighborhoods.\u201d",
      "Faquir said the significant grant and the ease of the process was helpful, especially compared to tougher questioning for smaller grants from other donors who asked \u201cfor an arm and a leg.\u201d \u201cThey saw us,\u201d she said. \u201cThey heard our story.\u201d",
      "More than 1,800 businesses were located in the Eaton and Palisades fire zones, according to Los Angeles County\u2019s Economic Development Corporation. They employed 9,600 workers and generated $1.4 billion in annual sales. The county estimates subsequent losses in economic output, income reductions, and tax revenue will be in the billions.",
      "\u201cMaking sure they stay afloat now is supercritical so that we can even talk to them about longterm recovery,\u201d Kelly LoBianco, director of L.A. County\u2019s Department of Economic Opportunity, said of those businesses.",
      "Businesses generally struggle to reopen after catastrophes. In 2023, three-quarters of small businesses were underinsured, according to the insurer Hiscox, and less than half had property insurance.",
      "In the L.A. fires, many business owners also lost their homes. Some are still repaying loans from the COVID-19 pandemic. The county is distributing about $20 million in emergency grants, but LoBianco said much more will be needed.",
      "After applications flooded in for its own program, 11:11 Media Impact and GoFundMe.org expanded it from 11 to 50 grants. The recipients include childcare centers, bakeries, bookshops, dance studios, and salons.",
      "\u201cSeeing the overwhelming response from women entrepreneurs in need of support showed us how important and urgent the need is to help this community rebuild,\u201d said Hilton.",
      "The money will boost entrepreneurs who worried the Eaton Fire had destroyed their futures, said Lizzy Okoro Davidson, director of the Pasadena Women\u2019s Business Center, which is partnering on the grant program. The money can help pay back-rent after long closures, secure new spaces, and replace equipment. \u201cIn some cases the $25,000 will be the bridge to get them to 100% of what they need,\u201d said Okoro Davidson.",
      "Renata Ortega, owner of Orla Floral Studio, used to run her floral design company out of a converted garage next to the home she shared with her husband and three dogs in the Altadena foothills.",
      "Since the Eaton fire destroyed their property, Ortega has been working from a shared workshop in downtown LA lent to her by a fellow floral designer. It was a kindness Ortega deeply appreciates, but she knows she'll eventually need her own space.",
      "\u201cI really didn\u2019t know if we were going to make it or how long we were going to make it, having to start from scratch, so this grant is really giving me hope right now at a time of uncertainty,\u201d she said.",
      "Ortega will use the money for a deposit and rent on a studio while she and her husband rebuild their property. She also needs to replace all the vases, shelving, and tools she lost.",
      "\u201cI can continue a business that was once just a dream for me,\u201d said Ortega, adding that she will be forever grateful to Hilton. \u201cNow we\u2019re going to make it.\u201d",
      "The Pasadena Women\u2019s Business Center will also receive $25,000 to provide no-cost advising to local business owners. Okoro Davidson said entrepreneurs will need lots of encouragement to keep going.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re really at the beginning of the beginning of the rebuild process,\u201d she said, adding that \u201creimagining\u201d businesses will come next. Companies that never even had websites might now sell their products online, she said, or restaurants could convert to food trucks while they \u2014 and their customers \u2014 rebuild.",
      "The grants came largely from GoFundMe.org\u2019s Wildfire Relief Fund, which has raised $7.7 million from 43,000 donors so far. Hilton, whose Malibu home burned in the Palisades Fire, donated $150,000 to the Wildfire Relief Fund.",
      "Her nonprofit, which normally focuses on protecting children and amplifying female voices, raised $1.2 million in the first week after the fires.",

      "The ruling from a New Mexico judge allows the possible release of redacted police body camera video and other investigative materials, including images of the couple's dead dog. All photos, video and documents from the investigation had been restricted from release by an earlier, temporary court order.",
      "\u201cThere shall be no depiction of either body in any video production\u201d or photographic image of the bodies, Santa Fe-based Judge Matthew Wilson said in response to questions from attorneys on his ruling.",
      "A representative for the Hackman family estate had urged a New Mexico judge to keep the records sealed to protect the family\u2019s constitutional right to privacy.",
      "The partially mummified remains of Hackman and Arakawa were found in their Santa Fe home on Feb. 26, when maintenance and security workers showed up at the home and alerted police.",
      "Authorities have said Hackman, 95, died of heart disease with complications from Alzheimer\u2019s disease about a week after his wife died of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, which is a rare, rodent-borne disease. Hackman may have been unaware Arakawa, 65, was dead.",
      "One of the couple\u2019s three dogs, a kelpie mix named Zinna, also was found dead in a crate in a bathroom closet near Arakawa, while two other dogs were found alive. A state veterinary lab tied the dog's death to dehydration and starvation.",
      "Authorities unraveled the mysterious circumstances of the couple\u2019s deaths and described their conclusions at a March 7 news conference without releasing most related written and photographic records.",
      "New Mexico\u2019s open records law blocks public access to sensitive images, including depictions of dead bodies. Experts also say some medical information is not considered public record under the state Inspection of Public Records Act.",
      "In seeking to block the release of records, estate representative Julia Peters had emphasized the possibly shocking nature of photographs and video in the investigation and potential for their dissemination by media. The Hackman family estate also sought to block the eventual release of autopsy reports by the Office of the Medical Investigator and death investigation reports by the Santa Fe County Sheriff\u2019s Office.",
      "An attorney for the estate, Kurt Sommer, argued during Monday's hearing that the couple took great pains to stay out of the public light during their lifetimes and that the right to control the use of their names and likenesses should extend to their estate in death.",
      "The bulk of death investigations by law enforcement and autopsy reports by medical investigators are typically considered public records under state law in the spirit of ensuring government transparency and accountability.",
      "The Associated Press, CBS News and CBS Studios intervened in the matter. Gregory P. Williams, an attorney for the news outlets, told the judge that they had previously said in court filings that they would not disseminate images of the couple's bodies and would blur images to obscure them from other records.",
      "\u201cThere is certainly a public interest in knowing how their deaths were investigated and knowing how that was handled,\u201d Williams said.",
      "Susan Madore, a publicist who had worked with the Hackmans for years, testified that the couple relished living in Santa Fe because it afforded them anonymity. Hackman retired in the early 2000s.",
      "Arakawa had no children, while Hackman is survived by three children from a previous marriage.",
      "At Monday's hearing, an attorney for Hackman's son and daughters highlighted the possible traumatic effects of releasing conversations about the deaths within police body camera videos.",
      "Scot Sauder, an attorney for the state medical investigator, told the judge that autopsy reports for Hackman and his wife do not yet exist and won\u2019t include past health care information once completed. It can take months for autopsy reports to be completed.",
      "Privacy likely also will play a role as the couple\u2019s estate is settled. According to probate court documents, Hackman signed an updated will in 2005 leaving his estate to his wife while the will she signed that year directed her estate to him. With both dying, management of the estate is in Peters' hands.",
      "Without trust documents being made public, it\u2019s unclear who the beneficiaries are and how the assets will be divided.",

      "\u201cI will call it like it is. This was a horrific tragedy caused by someone who shouldn\u2019t have been on the road,\u201d Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch told reporters at crash scene. \u201cA mother and two young children killed. Another child fighting for his life. A family and a neighborhood devastated.\u201d",
      "A phone number for Yarimi could not be found. Calls to the Kings County courts were not answered and there was no information in the court system about who might be representing her.",
      "Tisch said Yarimi's Audi rear-ended a Toyota around 1 p.m. Both drivers had minor injuries, as did another adult and three children in the Toyota. Yarimi had to be extracted from the wreck from her vehicle after it flipped over.",
      "The collision sent the Audi into the pedestrians, who were in the crosswalk before the vehicle overturned, authorities said. The 35-year-old woman and her 6- and 8-year-old daughters were pronounced dead at the scene, and the 4-year-old boy was hospitalized in critical condition.",
      "\u201cThis is extremely concerning and painful, not only to the City of New York in general, but specifically to a very close knit community,\u201d Adams said. \u201cA mother gone for a simple stroll on a sunny day was struck and killed. As we pray for their families and this entire community, the city mourns this loss.\u201d",

      "MADISON, Wis. -- Wisconsin's attorney general on Sunday asked the liberal-controlled state Supreme Court to stop billionaire Elon Musk from handing over $1 million checks to two voters, an appeal that came hours before President Donald Trump's ally planned the giveaway at an evening rally.",
      "An appeals court on Saturday rejected the legal challenge by Democrat Josh Kaul, who argues that Musk's offer violates a state law prohibiting giving anything of value in exchange for a vote.",
      "Wisconsin's tightly contested Supreme Court election, where ideological control of the court is at stake, is on Tuesday. Liberals currently hold a 4-3 majority.",
      "At Musk's rally scheduled in Green Bay at 7:30 p.m. EST, he promised to hand over a pair of $1 million checks to voters who signed an online petition against \u201cactivist\u201d judges.",
      "Trump and Musk are backing Waukesha County Judge Brad Schimel in the Supreme Court race, while Democrats are behind Dane County Judge Susan Crawford. Trump and groups he supports have spent more than $20 million to help Schimel get elected.",
      "Crawford's campaign declined to comment Sunday on the appeal.",
      "The justices who are being asked to decide the matter include the liberal incumbent whose retirement this year set up the race for an open seat and control of the court. The contest has shattered national spending records for a judicial election, with more than $81 million in spending.",
      "Musk\u2019s political action committee used a nearly identical tactic before the presidential election last year, offering to pay $1 million a day to voters in Wisconsin and six other battleground states who signed a petition supporting the First and Second Amendments. A judge in Pennsylvania said prosecutors failed to show the effort was an illegal lottery and allowed it to continue through Election Day.",
      "The appeals court said Saturday that the attorney general, in a \u201cminimally developed legal argument,\u201d failed to show that he was entitled to an order blocking Musk. The court also noted that Kaul alleged that the Columbia County Circuit Court had refused to hear his lawsuit, but he provided no details about the court\u2019s action.",
      "There is no entry for the county court's decision in the state\u2019s online court database and neither Kaul\u2019s office nor the state court office has provided any documentation to The Associated Press of the court\u2019s actions which came after business hours on Friday night.",
      "\u201cWe are not permitted to be the first court to decide whether the respondents are engaged in the conduct that is alleged, or to decide the legal status of that conduct,\u201d the appeals court said.",
      "Musk on Friday initially said in a post on his social media platform, X, that he planned to \u201cpersonally hand over\u201d $2 million to a pair of voters who have already cast their ballots in the race.",
      "Musk later posted a clarification, saying the money would go to people who will be \u201cspokesmen\u201d for an online petition against \u201cactivist\u201d judges. After first saying the event would only be open to people who had voted in the Supreme Court race, he said attendance would be limited to those who have signed the petition.",
      "Also on Friday, Musk\u2019s political action committee identified the recipient of its first $1 million giveaway \u2014 a Green Bay man who had donated to the Wisconsin GOP and the conservative candidate in the court race, and who has a history of posting support for Trump and his agenda.",
      "The judicial election comes as Wisconsin's highest court is expected to rule on abortion rights, congressional redistricting, union power and voting rules that could affect the 2026 midterms and the 2028 presidential election in the state.",

      "Every time Donald Trump has mentioned his plan to levy massive tariffs on imports into the US, there has been a widespread assumption that they will be delayed, watered down or rowed back.",
      "Today, he will reveal in the White House Rose Garden not just how serious he is about \"the most beautiful word in the dictionary\", but effectively call time on decades of economic globalisation.",
      "And it is still possible that he will do this by launching the equivalent of a salvo of ballistic missiles into the global trading system, with a universal tariff on all imports into the USA.",
      "The option of a 20% universal tariff is the only way to get to some of the massive revenues of trillions of dollars claimed by some of his advisers.",
      "In recent days, President Trump has been adamant that the tariffs will be \"reciprocal\" and the US will be \"nicer\" to its trade partners.",
      "That doesn't rule out wide-scale imposition of tariffs at 10 or 20%, if, for example, the US deems that Value Added Taxes are tariffs.",
      "It is possible that countries could be very broadly bracketed into different levels of a basically universal tariff. As one G7 negotiator told me at the weekend, \"it all comes down to President Trump\".",
      "A system such as this, with equivalent global retaliation, would see the UK economy shrinking by 1%, enough to wipe out growth and lead to pressure for tax rises or spending cuts.",
      "The total cost around the world could, according to an Aston University Business School study, be $1.4 trillion (\u00a31.1tn), as trade is diverted, and prices rise.",
      "In industry, there is some expectation that the European Union will target US tech companies. There could be quite the contrast should the UK choose not just to hold back on retaliation, but offer a significant tax cut to US big tech.",
      "Trade wars are hard to win, and easy for everyone to lose.",
      "A universal tariff of 20%, or its equivalent, would be a historic hit to the global trading system, on a par with the infamous Smoot-Hawley tariffs nearly a century ago.",
      "There is something bigger here, however. As the Vice President JD Vance said in a speech last month, globalisation has failed in the eyes of this administration because the idea was that \"rich countries would move further up the value chain, while the poor countries made the simpler things\".",
      "As that has not panned out, especially in the case of China, the US is moving away from this world.",
      "If the US overplays its hand in alienating its allies today, China will be waiting. The hit to US business in Europe, for example, could be offset by cheaper electronics, clothes, and toys from the East arriving in the UK and lowering prices, diverted from the US market.",
      "What starts later today is designed not just to reshape America, and trade, but the way the world itself has been run."

      "Why are bills going up?",
      "Tashi and Chris asked why bills are going up.",
      "This is a very simple question, but I'm afraid the answer isn't straightforward. There are a host of reasons why bills are rising.",
      "On energy, it's the consequence of an increase in wholesale prices paid by suppliers, often owing to global events.",

      "Consumer groups are urging people to shop around, claim everything they are entitled to, and cut back where possible.",
      "We have a guide to help you here.",
      "Is cash a better way to budget?",

      "Although cash use was hit during the pandemic, it has made a bit of a comeback, with many people taking the same view as James.",
      "However, there are areas in which this doesn't work.",
      "Shopping around for a better deal on essential bills is often something done online, and may require signing up to a direct debit payment. Rewards, or money off, are often also available to those who pay by card.",

      "Will my wage rise be eaten away by tax?",
      "Richard Kendall asked about frozen tax thresholds, which mean pay rises can see people drawn into paying higher rates of income tax.",

      "There have been rumours that the freeze could be extended, but there are no concrete plans for that as yet.",
      "So, more people are being dragged into paying higher rates of tax, or simply having a greater proportion of their income taxed.",
      "Taking a closer look at your pay slip is worthwhile, and it needs to be considered when looking at your personal budget. Experts say studying exactly how much post-tax income is coming in, and looking at it alongside your spending, is never a waste of time.",
      "And it may require you to trim some of your spending. Shopping around, or cancelling unused subscriptions are a good start, experts say.",
      "Do we just have to accept water bill increases?",
      "Colin Smith: Do we simply have to accept water bill increases because we can't shop around?",
      "Water services are different, because the 'switch for a better deal' advice simply doesn't, ahem, hold water.",

      "Experts say getting a water meter fitted can reduce bills if you have relatively low usage. Water-saving shower heads, or similar, are available free from some companies.",
      "Then, there is the WaterSure scheme, which means the bill is capped for people on certain benefits, who have a medical condition, or who have a certain number of school-age children at home. You do need to apply for this help though.",

      "Sam Halkyard, 32, from Rotherham: How does the government expect the economy to grow with all these bill increases?",

      "There is a delicate balancing act here. The government wants people's living standards to rise, and it wants them to spend to encourage investment by businesses.",
      "Remember, all of this comes with a background of wage rises outpacing prices, an uptick in the housing market, and some signs of hope for the wider economy.",
      "But ministers won't want to see a return of runaway inflation - the annual rise of prices - because that would inevitably lead to a rise in interest rates, and higher borrowing costs for businesses and individuals.",

      "What's happening with energy standing charge?",
      "David Bosworth and Jeff Rumble asked how the energy standing charge applies to bills.",
      "This is a household cost which many people feel is unfair - not least because there is nothing you can do about it.",
      "Standing charges are the fees charged to all billpayers to cover the cost of being connected to a gas and electricity supply. They are unaffected by the amount of energy that a household uses.",
      "After rising sharply in recent years, the average electricity standing charge actually fell from today - although it rose slightly for gas. More significantly, it varies considerably depending on where you live.",
      "The energy regulator, Ofgem, is considering reform that would allow people a choice of ways to pay - but stresses that these costs will still need to be covered.",
      "Council tax: What do I get for it?",
      "Ian Griffiths, from Flintshire, on council tax: Other than having my bin emptied once a fortnight, I don't actually have anything for the money I pay.",
      "In Wales, local authorities are increasing 2025-2026 council tax bills by between 5% and more than 9%.",
      "Ian may be stretching his point a little - local authorities provide a range of services such as street lighting, parks and care services.",
      "However, at its heart, his question highlights a common debate.",
      "Should these bill increases stay at the bare minimum because people are struggling financially, or are our local services in such desperate need of investment that council tax needs to go up above inflation?",
      "Are pensioners facing a harder hit?",

      "One important point to stress here is that different people, in different areas of the country, will be affected in different ways.",
      "Water and energy bills vary depending on where you live, and the different nations of the UK have different rules on council tax and more.",
      "But the state pension is UK-wide, and the good news is that it will be going up by more than the rate of price rises from next week. The triple lock means it will increase by 4.1%.",
      "Does everyone get the full state pension? No.",
      "Does the increase mean pensioners' finances won't be stretched? Of course not.",
      "But when asked about how people will cope, ministers are inevitably pointing to this increase as evidence of how the government is helping out.",
      "What about the minimum wage increase?",
      "David and Steve pointed out that incomes are rising, including via an increase of the minimum wage.",
      "Yes, it is not all doom and gloom today.",
      "There is an increase in the minimum wage - up to \u00a312.21 an hour for over 21s - and there are increases too for younger workers and apprentices.",
      "Official figures show that average wages have been rising faster than prices. The state pension and benefits will also go up from next week.",

      "But they combine synthetic artificial content with views of real-world environments.",

      "Mr Toikkanen says that before the war technologies that could be used by military forces used to be \"kind of a red flag\" for investors concerned about social and environmental responsibilities, and Varjo's executives would \"tiptoe around\" that side of the business when seeking funding.",

      "However, there's a lot of variation depending on your supplier.",
      "For example, the annual Southern Water bill is jumping 47% to \u00a3703, while Anglian Water customers are paying 19% more, or \u00a3626.",
      "The increases are being front-loaded for the next five years, meaning the biggest rise is coming this year.",

      "Regulator Ofgem increased the energy price cap because of higher wholesale costs and inflation.",

      "It covers 22 million homes in England, Wales and Scotland.",

      "Read more: Fixed-price deals are not affected by the energy price cap and offer certainty for a set period. But if energy prices drop when you are on the deal, you could be stuck at a higher price.",
      "3. Council tax",

      "The Scottish government says it is offering local authorities an extra \u00a31bn in 2025-26 to help reduce the scale of any rise.",
      "In Wales, council tax rates are jumping by as much 15% in some areas. Local authorities were given \u00a3253m by the Welsh government in its draft budget, but council leaders say more money needed.",
      "Northern Ireland uses a domestic rates system instead of council tax. All of Northern Ireland's councils have reported district rate increases for the next year.",

      "First-time buyers currently had paid no stamp duty on homes up to \u00a3425,000, but this is dropping to \u00a3300,000.",

      "For instance, under the new rules, someone with a mobile sim-only contract with EE will see their bill go up by \u00a31.50 a month, or \u00a318 a year.",
      "But the majority of EE customers who took their contract out before 10 April 2024, will face an increase of 6.4%, which is based on the December 2024 inflation rate plus an additional charge.",
      "Similarly, most Virgin Media broadband customers will face a 7.5% rise in bills, but anyone who took out a contract after 9 January 2025 will see their monthly bill go up by \u00a33.50.",
      "The cost of a TV licence is also going up by \u00a35 to \u00a3174.50. The cost for a black and white TV is going up by \u00a31.50 to \u00a358.50.",
      "6. Car tax",
      "The standard rate of tax for cars registered after April 2017 is rising \u00a35 to \u00a3195 a year. According to the RAC, you may pay less or more if your car was first used before 2017.",
      "The exact amount for your vehicle excise duty will depend on the year your car was registered and the type of fuel it uses.",
      "One big change is that electric vehicles (EVs) will no longer be tax exempt.",
      "EVs registered from April 2025 will pay the lowest rate of \u00a310 in the first year, then move to the standard rate. The standard rate will also apply to EVs first registered after April 2017.",
      "7. Hidden tax rises",
      "The government has kept in place the freeze on tax thresholds on income tax and National Insurance until 2028, a policy brought in by the previous government.",
      "This is often dubbed a stealth tax because of a process called \"fiscal drag\", which sees more people \"dragged\" into paying higher rates of tax as wages rise.",
      "The new tax year begins on 6 April.",
      "According to the government's financial watchdog, the frozen thresholds mean that by 2028-29, nearly four million additional people will be expected to pay income tax - and three million more will have moved to the higher rate.",

    "summary": "Economists say the president's import taxes could result in higher prices for a range of products in the US.",
    "story": [
      "US President Donald Trump has announced and imposed a range of tariffs - or import taxes - on billions of dollars worth of goods coming into the US from some of its top trading partners.",
      "In March, tariffs on steel and aluminium imported to the US came into effect, as well as tariffs on other products from Mexico, Canada, and China specifically.",
      "In addition, Trump has promised to announce a raft of new tariffs on Wednesday which will hit \"all countries\" and he is expected to enact some previously delayed tariffs on Mexico and Canada.",
      "Then, on Thursday, tariffs on cars coming into the US will come into effect. Tariffs on certain car parts are set to start in May or later.",
      "Economists have warned these tariffs - and those introduced in response by other countries - could put prices up for American consumers.",
      "That's because the tax is paid by the domestic company importing the goods, which may choose to pass the cost on to customers, or to reduce imports, meaning fewer products are available.",
      "So which things could become more expensive?",
      "Cars",
      "The US imported about eight million cars last year - accounting for about $240bn (\u00a3186bn) in trade.",
      "Many US car companies also have operations in Mexico and Canada, set up under the terms of the longstanding free trade agreement between them.",
      "Component parts typically cross the US, Mexican and Canadian borders multiple times before a vehicle is completely assembled.",
      "The new tariffs on car parts from Canada and Mexico are exempt for now while US customs and border patrol set up a system to assess the duties.",
      "Anderson Economic Group has estimated that tariffs on parts just from Canada and Mexico could lead to costs rising by roughly $4,000-$10,000 depending on the vehicle.",
      "Experts say these costs are likely to be passed on to customers, though Trump himself has said he \"couldn't care less\" if that happens as he believes it will encourage Americans to buy American-made cars instead.",
      "What are tariffs and why is Trump using them?",
      "What are tariffs and why is Trump using them?",
      "Beer, whisky and tequila",
      "Popular Mexican beers Modelo and Corona could get more expensive for US customers if the American companies importing them pass on the increased import taxes.",
      "Meanwhile, representatives from the American, Canadian, and Mexican spirit industries argued in a joint statement that drinks like bourbon, Tennessee whiskey, tequila, and Canadian whisky \"can only be produced in their designated countries\".",
      "So, given they have to be made in those locations, supplies might be affected, leading to price rises.",
      "Trump has also threatened a 200% tariff on alcohol from the EU, which could make Spanish wine, French champagne, or German beer more expensive for Americans, though it is not clear if this will be carried out.",
      "Houses",
      "The US imports about a third of its softwood lumber from Canada each year, and that key building material could be hit by Trump's tariffs.",
      "Trump has said the US has \"more lumber than we ever use\".",
      "However, the National Association of Home Builders (NAHB) has \"serious concerns\" that the tariffs on lumber could increase the cost of building homes - which are mostly made out of wood in the US - and also put off developers building new homes.",
      "\"Consumers end up paying for the tariffs in the form of higher home prices,\" the NAHB said.",
      "Imports from the rest of the world could also be affected.",
      "On 1 March, Trump ordered an investigation into whether the US should place additional tariffs on most lumber and timber imports, regardless of their country of origin, or create incentives to boost domestic production.",
      "Findings are due towards the end of 2025.",
      "Maple syrup",
      "Canada's billion-dollar maple syrup industry accounts for 75% of global production.",
      "The majority of the sweet staple - around 90% - is produced in the province of Quebec, where the world's sole strategic reserve of maple syrup was set up 24 years ago.",
      "\"That maple syrup is going to become more expensive. And that's a direct price increase that households will face,\" said Thomas Sampson from the London School of Economics.",
      "\"If I buy goods that are domestically produced in the US, but [which use] inputs from Canada, the price of those goods is also going to go up,\" he added.",
      "Fuel prices",
      "Canada is America's largest foreign supplier of crude oil.",
      "According to the most recent official trade figures, 61% of oil imported into the US between January and November 2024 came from Canada.",
      "While the US has introduced a 25% tariff on most goods imported from Canada, Canadian energy faces a lower rate of 10%.",
      "The US doesn't have a shortage of oil, but its refineries are designed to process so-called \"heavier\" - or thicker - crude oil, which mostly comes from Canada, with some from Mexico.",
      "\"Many refineries need heavier crude oil to maximize flexibility of gasoline, diesel and jet fuel production,\" according to the American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers.",
      "That means if Canada decided to reduce crude oil exports in retaliation against US tariffs, it could push up fuel prices.",
      "Avocados",
      "Avocados thrive in the Mexican climate.",
      "Nearly 90% of the avocados consumed in the US come from Mexico.",
      "The US Agriculture Department has warned that tariffs on Mexican fruit and vegetables could increase the cost of avocados.",
      "Related dishes like guacamole could also become more expensive.",

      "Read more on the April bill rises",
      "Three ways to cushion the blow of bill risesWill I have have to pay more for water?How much is council tax going up?Why are gas and electricity bills rising and can I fix? Car tax to broadband - seven bills going up in AprilHow much is the minimum wage increasing by?",

      "\"Our research shows that switching providers if you're out of contract can slash broadband, pay TV and mobile bills by up to \u00a3235,\" says Emily Seymour, from consumer group Which?",
      "Gas and electricity are often the biggest bills people face and the price cap set by the regulator is rising by 6%, so it is worth finding the best deal for you.",
      "That may include choosing a fixed rate deal, says Ms Seymour. If you charge an electric vehicle or use appliances overnight, look for a deal with a cheaper night tariff.",
      "\"We'd also recommend taking a meter reading as close to 31 March as possible to ensure you're billed the correct amount for your energy usage,\" she says.",
      "2. Cut back",
      "One surefire way to keep your bills down is to reduce what you use.",
      "Taking shorter showers and putting in a showerhead with a slower flow will save money on your water and energy bills.",
      "\"You have to treat water as an expensive resource,\" Ms Haine says.",
      "Getting a water meter fitted may save you money, she adds.",
      "Smart meters for electricity and gas can also help you keep tabs on what is pushing up your energy bills most, the Energy Saving Trust says.",
      "The trust advises draught-proofing your home, including round floorboards, pipework and old extractor fans, and setting the thermostat to the lowest comfortable temperature. For most people, it says, that is between 18\u00b0C and 21\u00b0C.",
      "MoneySavingExpert says you can save money by using the principle: \"heat the human, not the home\". Using hot water bottles and electric blankets should work out cheaper than turning up the radiators.",
      "You can also change the settings on combi or conventional boilers to save money, says Martin Lewis at MoneySavingExpert.",
      "When it comes to transport bills, you can't avoid the vehicle tax rise unless you ditch the car altogether.",
      "But if you are taking the train it is also worth checking whether a railcard will help, points out Ms Seymour.",
      "\"To cut costs on rail fares, we'd recommend booking tickets in advance and splitting fares where possible,\" she says.",
      "3. Get help",
      "If you are struggling to pay your household bills, don't panic, says Richard Lane, chief client officer at the StepChange Debt Charity. He suggests creating a detailed budget that captures all your income and expenditure.",
      "\"This will allow you to get a clear picture of your finances and see how much you have leftover to pay toward any debts or make savings,\" he says.",
      "Then check what support you are entitled to.",
      "Water companies offer lower \"social\" and hardship tariffs for people on very low incomes, so it is worth calling your provider. People claiming benefits can often also get lower tariffs for broadband.",
      "\"These organisations have a regulatory responsibility to treat customers fairly and will be able to offer you tailored support,\" Mr Lane added.",
      "There is the government's Warm Home Discount, for people with high energy costs on a very low income, including Pension Credit. And people on low incomes are also eligible for a reduction in council tax.",
      "Check if you qualify for a free TV licence. If you are over 75 and on Pension Credit or live with someone who is, then you will.",
      "You may also be able to boost your income. Check which benefits you are entitled to on the independent MoneyHelper website, backed by the government, or using benefits calculators run by Policy in Practice and charities Entitledto and Turn2us.",
      "If you are struggling with debt here are some other organisations that may be able to help."

      "The forecaster has warned that a trade war could cut the size of the British economy by 1% in the worst-case scenario.",
      "Trump has already announced a series of tariffs on steel, aluminium and vehicles coming into the US - and unlike other countries, the UK has decided not to set out plans to retaliate with tariffs of its own.",
      "But ahead of the latest round of expected tariffs, ministers are facing calls to hit back and protect UK business from the impact of Trump's taxes.",
      "Sector worries",
      "The UK pharmaceuticals industry \u2013 which exported \u00a36.6bn of medicine and related products to the US in 2024 - admitted it is \"worried\" about US tariffs.",

      "The impact of a US tariff on all British goods is very uncertain. It depends on not just on the scale of any tariffs applied on British products, but how the government, businesses and consumers react.",
      "As the car industry knows already, tariffs are extremely worrying for the industries affected - as an exporter you hope that either some of it can be soaked up in the supply chain or your American customers will be happy to pay higher prices - or you take a hit to your own profits by lowering prices.",
      "Or you may lose sales, tariffs are undeniably bad news for exporters in the firing line.",
      "But their impact on prices in the UK is uncertain. If the UK government retaliates with tariffs on American products, households here could face rises. But countries such as China, if disadvantaged by American tariffs, could try to send their goods here instead, pushing down prices.",
      "Broadly, US tariffs would be detrimental to UK growth. Without retaliatory tariffs, the UK's official forecasters reckon that 0.6% could be knocked off UK growth next year - unhelpful but not disastrous. Underpinning that scenario is a number of assumptions.",
      "But, as it cautions, there are so many uncertainties about not just the policy, but how it would filter through."

    "summary": "Paul Marchant leaves after an allegation about his behaviour towards a woman \"in a social environment\".",
    "story": [
      "Primark boss Paul Marchant has resigned following an allegation by a woman about \"his behaviour towards her in a social environment\".",
      "Associated British Foods (ABF), which owns Primark, said following an investigation by external lawyers, Mr Marchant \"acknowledged his error of judgement and accepts that his actions fell below the standards expected\" by the business.",
      "Mr Marchant co-operated with the investigation and apologised to the individual, said ABF.",
      "The Primark boss had also been involved in a previous incident involving \"inappropriate communication\", ABF later confirmed.",
      "The company said that incident had been investigated \"some time ago\" and that \"proportionate action\" had been taken.",
      "ABF declined to provide any further details, including whether the incidents involved colleagues or individuals from outside the company. A spokesperson told the BBC this was to protect their identities as much as possible.",
      "'Immensely disappointed'",
      "Mr Marchant became chief executive of Primark in 2009, taking over from the firm's founder Arthur Ryan.",
      "In announcing Mr Marchant's resignation, George Weston, chief executive of ABF, said: \"I am immensely disappointed. Colleagues and others must be treated with respect and dignity. Our culture has to be, and is, bigger than any one individual.\"",
      "He added: \"At ABF, we believe that high standards of integrity are essential. Acting responsibly is the only way to build and manage a business over the long term.\"",
      "The company said it remains in contact with the individual \"who rightly raised her concerns and have offered her our support\".",
      "While Primark - or Penneys as it is known in Ireland - has been around since 1969 when Mr Ryan opened the first shop in Dublin, it began ramping up its overseas expansion under Mr Marchant's leadership.",
      "Its low-price clothing and rapidly changing stock won over cash-strapped but fashion-conscious younger customers. Although, according to Catherine Shuttleworth, retail analyst at the consultancy Savvy, it has got \"ubiquitous appeal\".",
      "She said: \"It has allowed access to affordable clothing for everybody and that has tied into a period of time where global supply chains have significantly changed, so that means you can access products and materials better and more easily.\"",
      "Prior to Primark, Mr Marchant worked for a number of retailers such as Debenhams, Topman and New Look. But, like his predecessor Mr Ryan, he has remained out of the spotlight.",
      "Ms Shuttleworth said Primark's leadership \"flies under the radar a bit because - it sounds a bit cheesy - they let their shops and their products do the talking\".",
      "Unlike many of its rivals, Primark resisted selling its products online before finally relenting in 2022 after Covid restrictions drove people to internet shopping. Even then, Primark only launched a click-and-collect service as opposed to offering deliveries.",
      "Like other low-cost fashion chains, Primark has been criticised for producing cheap, throwaway clothing.",
      "In a rare interview, Mr Marchant told the BBC in 2022: \"We have worked so hard and continue to work hard on ensuring that we're improving the quality and the durability of our clothing.",
      "\"We don't want customers to buy something and then discard it. We want them to buy, love and keep it in their wardrobe [and] hand it down to their friends.\"",
      "'Unsettling'",
      "Primark is a key part of the wider ABF business, contributing nearly half of the group's overall sales of \u00a320bn.",
      "However, in its most recent trading update covering the Christmas period, Primark reported a fall in sales for the UK and Ireland, which accounts for 45% of the retailer's revenues.",
      "ABF's share price fell by nearly 4% to \u00a318.64 after Monday's announcement.",
      "Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown, said Mr Marchant's departure came at a trying time for Primark.",
      "''The change at the top will be unsettling particularly given that Primark delivered a very mixed bag of results at the last count,\" she said.",
      "\"This leadership upset comes amid weaker consumer sentiment which has meant footfall at its stores has fallen - and the chain has been losing market share in the UK.\"",
      "She said that internationally the company has performed well, but added: \"There could be uncertainty ahead about the speed of expansion given the change of boss.\"",
      "Following Mr Marchant's \"immediate\" departure, ABF's finance director Eoin Tonge will become Primark's interim chief executive.",
      "The firm's financial controller, Joana Edwards, will step into Mr Tonge's role. The company said: \"Both executives have the experience to perform these roles well.\"",
      "ABF is majority-owned by the billionaire Weston family who, until 2021, owned  the department store Selfridges."

      "But she has been served a no-fault eviction notice, which her landlord says is unrelated to Sizewell C.",
      "He says he simply plans to retire, and reduce his outgoings by selling the property.",
      "Nevertheless, it has left Ms Ashford, a single mother who works in holiday lettings and cares for an elderly couple, looking for a new home and worried about what she can afford.",
      "Ms Ashford says: \"My whole life depends on me being here, but the greedy prices and extortionate rents are affecting the rest of the market.",
      "\"I feel very angry and I think what is happening in Leiston is criminal. Landlords are cashing in and the good days are way behind us.\"",
      "According to the ONS, 79.1% of people in East Suffolk aged between 16 and 64 are in paid work.",

      "Tim Day, director of Suffolk Coastal Estate Agents and Sizewell Lettings, says much of the current demand is for \"a service solution\" \u2013 a short-term option including bills and cleaning, \"not dissimilar to a holiday letting\".",
      "Although quoted prices may state, for example, \u00a33,000 a month, the tenant may not actually have to stay that long, says Mr Day, 55.",
      "\"There's not much difference between offering a service solution to Sizewell workers and doing Airbnb.",
      "\"We're in the accommodation business and we are responding to demand. But when one looks at that headline rate, it might not tell the true story.\"",
      "Mr Day believes the demand for accommodation will soon spread far beyond Leiston as workers begin to travel in on park-and-ride buses from Wickham Market or Darsham.",

      "A spokesperson for the National Residential Landlords Association says \"fluctuations\" in rental prices reflect the increasing costs of providing quality accommodation and the scarcity of available homes.",
      "\"Landlords' costs have increased significantly, which has unfortunately meant that many landlords have been forced to increase rents to ensure their businesses remain viable,\" they say.",

      "But try looking for American-made jelly in Europe, and you're likely to come up short.",
      "The US exports less than $300,000 (\u00a3231,000) in jam each year to the bloc.",
      "It's an imbalance that US company JM Smucker, one of the biggest sellers of such products in the US, blames on a 24%-plus import tax its fruit spreads face in the EU.",
      "\"The miniscule value of US exports to the European Union is entirely attributable to the high EU tariff,\" the company wrote in a letter to the White House this month, asking the Trump administration to address the issue as it prepares to levy \"reciprocal\" tariffs on America's biggest trading partners.",
      "\"Reciprocal US tariffs on EU jams and jellies would serve to level the playing field,\" the company said, noting that the highest US jam tariff is currently just 4.5%.",
      "Globally, Trump's push to deploy tariffs against close trading partners - many of which have average tariff levels similar to America's - has generated anger and bafflement, while drawing warnings from economists about higher prices and other potential economic pain.",
      "Some businesses in the US have echoed those concerns, but Trump's calls for tariffs are also channelling longstanding frustrations many firms have about foreign competition and policies they face abroad.",
      "Smucker's letter was one of hundreds submitted to the White House, seeking to influence the next set of tariffs, expected to be unveiled on 2 April.",
      "Apple farmers raised the big disparity in import duties their fruit faces in countries such as India (50%), Thailand (40%) and Brazil (10%), as well as sanitary rules in countries such as Australia they said unfairly block their exports.",
      "Streaming businesses flagged digital taxes in Canada and Turkey that they said \"unfairly target and discriminate\" against US companies.",
      "The oil and natural gas lobby criticised regulations in Mexico that require partnership with the state-owned oil company and other policies.",
      "The White House itself spotlighted uneven ethanol tariffs in Brazil (18%, compared with 2.5% in the US), car tariffs in Europe (10%, compared with 2.5% in the US) and motorcycles in India (until a few years ago, 100% vs 2.4% in the US).",
      "Trump has suggested that his plan for reciprocal tariffs will help remedy such grievances, pumping up his announcement as \"Liberation Day\".",
      "But even the businesses seeking action on their own issues have expressed hesitation about the president's tariff-first, ask-questions-later strategy, which risks retaliation and a wider trade war.",
      "With 2 April looming, there remains widespread uncertainty about the goals and scope of White House plans, especially as Trump launches more duties.",
      "\"We're going to be nice,\" he said this week, at the same time as he announced potentially devastating tariffs on foreign cars and car parts. \"I think people will be pleasantly surprised.\"",

      "But analysts warned that those hoping that Trump plans to use his reciprocal tariffs to negotiate changes elsewhere may be disappointed, as the president has also indicated he could be satisfied by simply hitting back.",

      "\"He's used them all at different times - there's not a single thread here that you can rely on.\"",
      "The mismatch between the blunt tool of tariffs and the more niche issues firms want the White House to champion has led to a delicate dance, as businesses suggest tariffs in their own interest, while also hoping to avoid the repercussions of the kind of sweeping duties that Trump has suggested might be on the table.",
      "For example, steel manufacturer NorthStar BlueScope Steel, which employs 700 people in the US melting steel from recycled metal, urged Trump to expand tariffs on steel and aluminium to parts.",
      "At the same time, however, it asked for an exemption for the raw materials it needs, such as scrap metal.",
      "Likewise, the lobby group for JM Smucker and other big food manufacturers, the Consumer Brands Association, warned against \"overly broad and sweeping tariffs\" that might end up making it more expensive for its members to import ingredients like cocoa, which are not made in the US.",
      "\"I don't necessarily want the current administration to say, well, we'll impose a tariff,\" Tom Madrecki, the group's vice president of supply chain resiliency, said at a recent forum about tariffs, hosted by Farmers for Free Trade.",
      "\"It's this careful balance between yes, I want you to take an America First trade policy and action to counter unfair trade policies abroad... but maybe not quite in that way.\"",
      "Wilbur Ross, who served as Trump's commerce secretary in his first term, said he thought business worries would dissipate as Trump's plans become clear, calling 2 April a \"big step\".",
      "But he noted that the president saw little downside to using tariffs, viewing them as either a source of new revenue, or a way to reduce imports and encourage more manufacturing.",
      "\"He's very committed,\" Ross said. \"People should have known that something like this was coming because he's been talking about it for many, many years.\"",

      "At a recent hearing on trade, Representative Jodey Arrington, a Republican who represents Texas, acknowledged that there might be \"some pain associated on the front end\", but maintained Trump's focus on the issue would create opportunities for his constituents in the end.",
      "\"It just seems to me that it's un-American to not fight for our American manufacturers, producers and workers to simply have an even playing field,\" he said.",
      "\"We're simply attempting... to reset those relationships such that we're playing by the same set of rules,\" he added. \"Then everyone wins.\""

      "This is a form of financing pegged to a set of annual environmental and social improvements agreed between a borrower and its banks.",
      "Gothenburg's four target areas are efforts to make renewable energy the sole source of the city's heat production, making the council's own vehicle fleet electric, reducing energy usage in municipality-owned buildings, such as hospitals and schools, and improving the city's poorest neighbourhoods.",
      "Meet agreed annual improvement levels in these sectors and, for each, Gothenburg gets a discount on the yearly fee it pays for the loan of 0.1% or around 100,000 kronor ($10,500; \u00a38,000). But miss one of the targets by a certain amount and it has to pay a fine of the same amount.",
      "In 2022 and 2023 Gothenburg managed to avoid a financial penalty, but the newly released figures for 2024 show that it missed its target for switching to renewable energy. And so it is about to be fined 150,000 kroner.",
      "However, this is offset by the discounts it is getting for continuing to hit improvement levels for energy usage and social improvement. For electrifying the council's vehicles, while it missed its improvement goal, it didn't do so by enough to be fined.",
      "Fredrik Block, portfolio manager at the City of Gothenburg, says that the local authority deliberately set \"ambitious\" targets.",
      "\"You aim high, and you get the whole organisation to strive towards that target. We are not proceeding as fast as we expected, but we are taking one step at a time. The goal is still to be close to carbon-free by 2030.",

      "The improvements to the city's poorest areas \u2013 and whether the council has hit its targets - are measured by yearly resident surveys. People are asked about their feelings towards an area's safety and cleanliness.",
      "Key initiatives have included making housing more secure, introducing more surveillance cameras and increasing police presence as a crime prevention measure in areas of the city like Hjallbo and Biskopsgarden. Located in the north of the city, they have high levels of crime and unemployment, and large immigrant populations.",
      "Public housing agency Framtiden, which is ultimately owned by the City of Gothenburg, says it takes the improvement work very seriously.",
      "\"For some of these vulnerable areas, we actually own the majority of the housing,\" says its research and development manager, Lars Bankvall.",
      "\"We are more or less the only official body in these areas. There's no one else there, only us.",

      "\"What will you tell them? You are showing them there is a difference between them and native Swedes.\"",
      "Ms Awil is also not convinced the resident surveys are effective or accurate. And she feels the city is placing a disproportionate amount of effort into its environmental goals, at the expense of improving conditions in underprivileged areas.",
      "\"People in these areas don't care about the environment. They need to go to school. They need to work. They need to eat,\" says Ms Awil, who migrated from Somalia to Sweden in 1987 as a child.",
      "Negotiating an SLL is a rigorous, complex process - one that took the City of Gothenburg a year to do, with no fewer than six major Nordic banks involved.",
      "Such is the difficulty of acquiring an SLL that the number issued globally fell by 56% in 2023, according to data from financial news provider Bloomberg.",
      "Mats Olausson is senior sustainability advisor at Swedish bank SEB, which is the lead lender of Gothenburg's SLL.",
      "He says SEB has turned down potential SLL borrowers as the client's proposed targets weren't ambitious enough. Yet he adds that SLLs are challenging for companies or local authorities that successfully get one.",
      "\"It's sad if a company puts a lot of resources into designing an SLL, and then it turns out that the only publicity they get is negative,\" he says. \"You run the risk of being pulled into the dirt for having not done a good enough job.",
      "\"It's in no one's interest to have targets that are overly ambitious and basically impossible to achieve, or for companies who don't have the right governance in place to implement the actions that will be the building blocks of the actual strategy.\"",
      "One company that is happy with its SLL is Danish management consultancy Emagine. It borrowed \u00a310m in 2021, funds that helped it to acquire six other firms around the world.",
      "Its binding goals include increasing the number of female leaders in the organisation by 16%, and reducing overall employee turnover by 6% over the seven-year long period. It is doing this through leadership and mentoring programs.",
      "By meeting the targets, Emagine is benefiting from reduced interest rates, says Lars Bloch, the company's chief financial officer.",

      "The team, based near Banbury in Oxfordshire, has taken five years to fine tune the design.",
      "\"Compared to a conventional aircraft it's got eight motors which is very strange,\" says Dr Bill Brooks, Skyfly's chief technical engineer.",
      "\"And it's a tail-first layout called a canard so it's got the tail at the front.  The all up weight is 750kg but 240kg of that are batteries so all the structure is carbon fibre to keep it as light as possible,\" Dr Brooks says.",
      "Safety is an important part of the design too.",
      "'Environmental benefits'",
      "The large wings help it to glide in the event of power failure and there are two motors at the end of each wing so that if one fails the other can compensate.",
      "It is also equipped with an emergency ballistic parachute to bring the aircraft and passengers down safely.",
      "As well as being safer and cleaner than conventional aircraft, Michael Thompson, Skyfly's chief executive, says electric models are significantly quieter too.",
      "\"When you're taking off, you're no longer annoying everyone around you from a noise perspective, so I do think electric propulsion brings not only environmental benefits but from a noise pollution point of view, it's a huge benefit as well,\" he says.",
      "Who is it marketed at?",
      "Other eVTOLs under development include those looking to provide an electric flying-taxi service like Bristol-based Vertical Aerospace (VA) .",
      "VA, as well as Archer and Joby in the US, are designing electric powered aircraft to carry up to four passengers.",
      "Skyfly's Axe, by comparison, is more compact and aimed at the private market.",
      "The do-it-youself kit-plane comes with a price tag of \u00a3250,000.",
      "It is aimed at existing pilots who want to transition away from diesel piston engines.",
      "Jason Pritchard, executive editor of eVTOL Insights, says it is also likely to appeal to flying clubs in order to train new members:",
      "\"The eVTOL aircraft industry is still in its infancy with initial operations a few years away, but it also needs to train large numbers of pilots in the coming years,\" he says.",
      "\"Additionally, the Axe's design can also train pilots with the skills and controls necessary to land an aircraft without power, which is a necessary tool.\"",
      "What about charging infrastructure?",
      "While the Axe can be charged up overnight with a conventional three-pin plug, just like EV cars, electric aircraft will need the charging infrastructure to be scaled up.",
      "Aerovolt, based in West Sussex, has installed rapid chargers at seven UK airports with 40 more in the pipeline.",
      "Its founder, Philip Kingsley-Dobson, says demand is growing.",
      "\"A lot of piston aircraft can't use leaded fuel in the future so they're looking for alternatives and ways we can decarbonise the lower end of aviation,\" he says.",
      "'Cutting edge'",
      "There are no eVTOL aircraft currently permitted to fly in the UK.",
      "Skyfly's Axe has successfully completed manned test flights in both hover and forward flight modes but still needs to be certified by the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA).",
      "With 40 pre-orders from buyers all over the world, the company hopes to deliver the new model to customers early next year.",
      "A CAA spokesperson said: \"We are working with innovators to test and fly brand new forms of aviation that keeps the UK at the cutting edge of flight technology and supports the sector to grow.",

      "It's Friday lunchtime at a Morrisons in Queensbury, north-west London, and the in-store cafe is busy.",
      "At one table, a teenager tucks into a ham sandwich while on the phone with a friend. She stays for well over half an hour.",
      "At another, an elderly couple chat over a hot meal, while a queue of customers steadily forms at the till.",
      "But this is one of 52 cafes set to close - including others in London, Leeds, Portsmouth and Glasgow - announced this week in a cost-cutting drive that the supermarket chain says is designed to \"renew and reinvigorate Morrisons\" and focus \"investment into the areas that customers really value\".",
      "That came two months after Sainsbury's said it was closing all 61 of its supermarket cafes.",
      "While some see the decline of supermarket cafes as inevitable, shoppers around the country have told BBC News that these cafes give them a cheap, convenient and welcoming place to get a warm meal while catching up with friends.",
      "'Share a meal without the stress of cooking'",
      "Regulars at the Morrisons cafe in Queensbury say they're surprised - and saddened - to hear it's closing.",
      "Philomena Hughes, 76, is having a meal with two friends, having just been shopping. The trio have bumped into a couple they know at the cafe, who move over to the table next to them and join in their conversation.",
      "Philomena says she's \"furious\" about the closure. \"Morrisons was really the only place I would come,\" she says. \"We meet people we know in here.\"",
      "Other regulars at the cafe tell the BBC that the quality is good, prices are low, and it's convenient to grab groceries beforehand. They point to offers such as a free kids meal with an adult's one, free parking, and fish and chips with mushy peas for \u00a38.50.",
      "Morrisons says 344 of its cafes will remain open despite the planned closures but, according to its chief executive Rami Baiti\u00e9h, \"a minority have specific local challenges and in those locations, regrettably, closure and re-allocation of the space is the only sensible option\".",
      "Elsewhere in the country, Ben Hopkins, 32, feels his local Morrisons cafe in Meltham, West Yorkshire, is bustling every time he goes because \"the food is typical of that you'd get in a traditional greasy spoon\".",
      "Such outlets can come in handy for parents, too. Lisa Clavering, from St Albans, says she relied on Asda and Morrisons cafes for a \"quick and cheap hot lunch\" when her two sons were younger.",
      "\"As they grew, it was somewhere we could go together and share a meal without the stress of cooking it and cleaning up, where I didn't feel judged by other customers if they made a noise,\" the 42-year-old says.",
      "Lisa says part of the appeal of supermarket cafes is that they feel accessible - a \"warm and welcoming place with no fuss and no surprises\".",
      "\"I do worry that once they go, there's not really a like-for-like to replace them, and other alternatives are typically much more expensive,\" Lisa says.",
      "'Should come as no surprise'",
      "But other people question the need for supermarket cafes, pointing to changes in people's shopping habits and the growing competition from high-street coffee chains.",
      "The closure of Morrisons cafes \"should come as no surprise,\" retail analyst Natalie Berg tells the BBC.",
      "\"The grocers are desperately trying to navigate significant cost headwinds, while simultaneously competing with discounters like Aldi and Lidl.",
      "\"This is a low-margin industry, so supermarkets need to be utterly ruthless when it comes to cost-cutting.\"",
      "When shoppers come into larger supermarkets, they \"want low prices and they want a frictionless experience. In-store cafes work in certain locations, but they're simply not essential for most stores,\" Ms Berg says.",
      "It largely echoes the reasoning Sainsbury's has given for its closures - that \"the majority of [its] most loyal shoppers do not use the cafes regularly\".",
      "Ben Tinca, 19, a student living near the Morrisons store in Queensbury, says he usually meets his friends at fast-food chains like Nando's, KFC and McDonald's.",
      "He's only ever been to a Morrisons cafe once. \"You usually only see older people eating there,\" he says.",
      "And back at the Queensbury store, Snehal Khimani doesn't think people care too much about supermarket cafes closing, saying there has been no \"outrage\".",
      "\"If it was popular, you'd hear about it,\" like when Pret A Manger changed its subscription service, he says.",
      "And besides, rival supermarket chains Tesco and Marks & Spencer - which have more than 300 cafes each - haven't said anything about closing their cafes.",
      "M&S tells the BBC that it's continuing to invest in its cafes and plans to have coffee shops in the majority of its bigger stores. Last year, it announced it would try offering more takeaway food and drink to attract younger customers.",
      "At an M&S Cafe in central London that the BBC visited, Matthew Wilsher has just got a cappuccino to go.",
      "For the 62-year-old, the numbers don't lie. His coffee cost \u00a33.40, and would have been less if he'd remembered his reusable cup. For him, \"that's cheaper than a Pret or a Starbucks,\" he says.",

      "A car that would sell for $13,000 (\u00a310,000) might rise to $14,500 (\u00a311,200) because of the tariffs, Mr Husseini said. He predicted that consumers will see prices increase in the next three to six weeks.",

    "story": [
      "We have all heard of carmaker Ford, but what about its one-time rivals Abbot-Detroit, Acme, Adams and Aerocar?",
      "No? Well that is hardly surprising because unlike Ford they all went bust very early on. And they are just some of the failed car companies starting with the letter \"A\".",
      "We only remember the winners who went on to dominate the world's motor industry, and the current high-tech sector is much the same.",
      "A great many investors backed the wrong horseless carriages around a century ago and lost their money. Only a few picked Ford or Chrysler, which is almost exactly what is happening now, only to the tech sector.",
      "Tech shares have been hugely volatile over the past year, as has been widely reported, with share price graphs often looking like rollercoaster rides, even before President Trump's tariffs have caused wider stocks falls.",
      "Nvidia shares sink as Chinese AI app spooks markets",
      "Tesla's challenges run deeper than 'toxic' controversy around Elon Musk",
      "US tech firms feel pinch from China tariffs",
      "A principle reason for this tech sector volatility, according to Elroy Dimson, professor of finance at the University of Cambridge, is that like the once nascent car industry we don't know which tech firms will win in the long run.",
      "\"If you go back to the beginning of the last century there were an awful lot of motor companies, and it was clear that automobiles were going to make a huge difference,\" says Prof Dimson. \"But almost every company went bankrupt, you didn't know which company you should be buying.\"",
      "Then, of course, not all high-tech businesses are making money. The measure of the return on an investment in shares uses two factors, the growth in profits or dividends, and the growth in the value of the shares.",
      "Boring companies might pay reliable dividends and see their shares gradually increase in value. But many high-tech companies are not paying out much if anything in dividends. Instead, they are investing in future growth, and so their share prices fluctuate based on hopes of future profits.",
      "As Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at UK financial services firm Hargreaves Lansdown, puts it: \"Tech shares are more volatile, they have high valuations and their price-earnings ratios are very high, and growth stocks are more sensitive to interest rate movements.\"",
      "But also, investors in such shares are, as Ms Streeter puts it, gambling on \"not jam today but jam tomorrow\". They are all trying to pick the next future big winner, not the one paying out profits now, but the one that will eventually pay huge dividends sometime in the future.",
      "So, any news or even suggestion that future growth is not going to be as good as previously expected means share values can collapse.",
      "On the other hand, any good news boosts share prices even if current profits, or even losses, don't change at all, as investors pile into what they think is the future winner. The shares are more volatile because they are not underwritten by current profits or dividends.",
      "That means as Prof Dimson puts it, \"that small changes in growth expectation can lead to large changes in share value\", which can effect a large number of companies at the same time.",
      "\"You have companies that are reasonably similar, so when growth rates change it is effecting quite a few companies in a similar way,\" he says.",
      "\"This is not different from the dotcom boom at the beginning of the 2000s. There were companies with huge growth prospects. And when the growth prospects disappeared, these were the companies that disappeared.\"",
      "Also, even today there are not that many really large high-tech companies. In America they are colloquially known as the \"magnificent seven\" - Nvidia, a chipmaker, Alphabet, which owns Google, Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, Meta, the parent of Facebook, and Tesla.",
      "So, it does not take much to spook the market, especially since several of these firms are really quite young, and are dominant in sectors where previous leaders have crashed and burned. Anyone remember Ericsson, Boo or Compaq?",
      "Technology, unlike say steel production or food manufacturing, is changing at a very rapid rate, and there is obviously the chance that a new high-tech company will come along and destroy the business model of its most established rivals.",
      "There is simply no guarantee that today's \"magnificent seven\" will remain magnificent or even stay as the same seven firms.",
      "Take Tesla for example, its sales have recently fallen in response to two widely-reported factors. Firstly, some potential customers are opposed to Tesla owner Elon Musk's involvement in President Trump's government.

    "summary": "Bills, bins, and benefits - the BBC's cost of living correspondent Kevin Peachy answers your questions on bill rises.",
    "story": [
      "A range of household bills, including council tax, water, gas and electricity have risen today.",
      "The BBC's cost of living correspondent, Kevin Peachey, has been answering your most asked questions on the price rises.",
      "Why are bills going up?",
      "Tashi and Chris asked why bills are going up.",
      "This is a very simple question, but I'm afraid the answer isn't straightforward. There are a host of reasons why bills are rising.",
      "On energy, it's the consequence of an increase in wholesale prices paid by suppliers, often owing to global events.",
      "Councils and water companies, meanwhile, say there's a desperate need to raise bills to pay for investment in services.",
      "Some bill increases are always scheduled for this time of year, to match the rate of rising prices - inflation.",
      "So another question is: what can you do about it?",
      "Consumer groups are urging people to shop around, claim everything they are entitled to, and cut back where possible.",
      "We have a guide to help you here.",
      "Is cash a better way to budget?",
      "James: I get \u00a3150 in cash out every week. It's amazing how it helps you budget things. Why don't more people try it?",
      "There is evidence of people turning to notes and coins to help them budget.",
      "Although cash use was hit during the pandemic, it has made a bit of a comeback, with many people taking the same view as James.",
      "However, there are areas in which this doesn't work.",
      "Shopping around for a better deal on essential bills is often something done online, and may require signing up to a direct debit payment. Rewards, or money off, are often also available to those who pay by card.",
      "So, it may well be that using a mix of ways to pay works best - but questions remain about access to cash and internet services among the vulnerable.",
      "Will my wage rise be eaten away by tax?",
      "Richard Kendall asked about frozen tax thresholds, which mean pay rises can see people drawn into paying higher rates of income tax.",
      "This is what is known as fiscal drag - not a phrase you'll hear talked about much, but it is important.",
      "It means that while income tax rates haven't risen, the income levels at which they are paid have been frozen, and will continue to be so until 2028.",
      "There have been rumours that the freeze could be extended, but there are no concrete plans for that as yet.",
      "So, more people are being dragged into paying higher rates of tax, or simply having a greater proportion of their income taxed.",
      "Taking a closer look at your pay slip is worthwhile, and it needs to be considered when looking at your personal budget. Experts say studying exactly how much post-tax income is coming in, and looking at it alongside your spending, is never a waste of time.",
      "And it may require you to trim some of your spending. Shopping around, or cancelling unused subscriptions are a good start, experts say.",
      "Do we just have to accept water bill increases?",
      "Colin Smith: Do we simply have to accept water bill increases because we can't shop around?",
      "Water services are different, because the 'switch for a better deal' advice simply doesn't, ahem, hold water.",
      "There is plenty of debate over why water bills are going up so much (remember some suppliers wanted bigger increases).",
      "But there are things you can do to keep your costs down, even though you can't shop around.",
      "Experts say getting a water meter fitted can reduce bills if you have relatively low usage. Water-saving shower heads, or similar, are available free from some companies.",
      "Then, there is the WaterSure scheme, which means the bill is capped for people on certain benefits, who have a medical condition, or who have a certain number of school-age children at home. You do need to apply for this help though.",
      "Does this hit the government's plans for growth?",
      "Sam Halkyard, 32, from Rotherham: How does the government expect the economy to grow with all these bill increases?",
      "Ministers are pushing their \"agenda for growth\" at every opportunity, calling for red tape to be cut to pave the way for investment.",
      "There is a delicate balancing act here. The government wants people's living standards to rise, and it wants them to spend to encourage investment by businesses.",
      "Remember, all of this comes with a background of wage rises outpacing prices, an uptick in the housing market, and some signs of hope for the wider economy.",
      "But ministers won't want to see a return of runaway inflation - the annual rise of prices - because that would inevitably lead to a rise in interest rates, and higher borrowing costs for businesses and individuals.",
      "So, outside of this, you are seeing the government push ahead with some big, long-term investment projects, like road tunnels and runways.",
      "I'm single, where's help for me?",
      "Jules, 57: I'm single. My wages don't go up in April. Where's the help for us?",
      "Charities have raised the alarm specifically about people like you, Jules.",
      "Citizens Advice says that single households, including single parents, tend to spend a greater proportion of their income on household bills.",
      "As a result, there is far less wriggle room financially when bills rise.",
      "One solution is to investigate all the options that are open to you. For example, as I'm sure you already know if it includes you, there is a 25% discount on council tax, for those who live on their own.",
      "But there is, without doubt, a single person premium on the cost of living because there's only one income coming in, so it may be harder to deal with the money going out.",

      "What's happening with energy standing charge?",
      "David Bosworth and Jeff Rumble asked how the energy standing charge applies to bills.",
      "This is a household cost which many people feel is unfair - not least because there is nothing you can do about it.",
      "Standing charges are the fees charged to all billpayers to cover the cost of being connected to a gas and electricity supply. They are unaffected by the amount of energy that a household uses.",
      "After rising sharply in recent years, the average electricity standing charge actually fell from today - although it rose slightly for gas. More significantly, it varies considerably depending on where you live.",
      "The energy regulator, Ofgem, is considering reform that would allow people a choice of ways to pay - but stresses that these costs will still need to be covered.",
      "Council tax: What do I get for it?",
      "Ian Griffiths, from Flintshire, on council tax: Other than having my bin emptied once a fortnight, I don't actually have anything for the money I pay.",
      "In Wales, local authorities are increasing 2025-2026 council tax bills by between 5% and more than 9%.",
      "Ian may be stretching his point a little - local authorities provide a range of services such as street lighting, parks and care services.",
      "However, at its heart, his question highlights a common debate.",
      "Should these bill increases stay at the bare minimum because people are struggling financially, or are our local services in such desperate need of investment that council tax needs to go up above inflation?",
      "Are pensioners facing a harder hit?",
      "Lyn Nailer: Will pensioners suffer the most from these bill rises?",
      "One important point to stress here is that different people, in different areas of the country, will be affected in different ways.",
      "Water and energy bills vary depending on where you live, and the different nations of the UK have different rules on council tax and more.",
      "But the state pension is UK-wide, and the good news is that it will be going up by more than the rate of price rises from next week. The triple lock means it will increase by 4.1%.",
      "Does everyone get the full state pension? No.",
      "Does the increase mean pensioners' finances won't be stretched? Of course not.",
      "But when asked about how people will cope, ministers are inevitably pointing to this increase as evidence of how the government is helping out.",
      "What about the minimum wage increase?",
      "David and Steve pointed out that incomes are rising, including via an increase of the minimum wage.",
      "Yes, it is not all doom and gloom today.",
      "There is an increase in the minimum wage - up to \u00a312.21 an hour for over 21s - and there are increases too for younger workers and apprentices.",
      "Official figures show that average wages have been rising faster than prices. The state pension and benefits will also go up from next week.",
      "This will certainly help pay some of those bills, and you won't see the impact directly until you look at your bank balance in the coming weeks.",
      "The Treasury is also pointing to moves to freeze fuel duty and ensure the main rates of tax - income tax, VAT and employees' National Insurance - do not go up during this Parliament, as evidence of the support billpayers are receiving.",
      "Is there a silver lining?",
      "Bills may be rising - but for some people, incomes are going up too.",
      "Benefits and the state pension are going up in a week's time. Wages have also been rising at a faster pace than the rate of inflation, and the start of April also brings an increase in the minimum wage. It means:",
      "The minimum wage for over 21s, known officially as the National Living Wage, has risen by 6.7%, from \u00a311.44 to \u00a312.21 an hour.

    "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2gey6pvddo",
    "published": "Fri, 28 Mar 2025 00:00:13 GMT",
    "summary": "Why the reign of the free market is facing its biggest ever challenge",
    "story": [
      "I remember 1974 well. With inflation on the rise, the government had been locked in battle with trade unions over worker pay. The government appeared paralysed: stand up to the miners and strikes could shut down the power system, but give in and pay them more money and inflation would rocket.",
      "And then the global oil crisis came out of nowhere. It threw economies, including Britain's, into chaos. The government introduced a three-day week. Power cuts were common - we would be plunged into darkness without warning. And seemingly, the government just expected us to deal with it.",
      "This was also the year I began presenting the BBC's current affairs programme Panorama. We spent a lot of time debating these issues. People came on with all kinds of different ideas of what to do.",
      "There were even suggestions that what the country really needed to take back control from the unions was a military takeover - a coup.",
      "There was another idea out there too. It was proposed by the Conservative politician Keith Joseph and was entirely radical - so removed from the mainstream, in fact, that during filming of Panorama, Joseph turned to the production team and asked exasperatedly if they understood what he meant.",
      "That idea was the free market.",
      "This meant Britain departing from the post World War Two consensus that government should control the economy and that instead if you left the markets alone, they would deliver the country greater prosperity and security.",
      "If, in 2025, the idea sounds anything but radical, that's exactly the point.",
      "What we saw in the UK in the 1980s under Margaret Thatcher's government was just how quickly the free market transitioned from a radical idea into the new reality. Then before long it became what many assumed was the system that would last forever.",
      "US President Donald Trump is a billionaire businessman who has clearly done well financially out of capitalism. But suddenly, thanks in part to him, the free market system finds itself under assault like never before.",
      "It might yet weather the storm. However others are asking, is the free market system fatally flawed and doomed to failure?",
      "The fantasy world of Thatcher's Britain",
      "So much of what Thatcher did in the wake of her 1983 general election victory seems so obvious now. We take it for granted that private companies play a pivotal role in providing our water, electricity, gas, railways, ports and freight.",
      "But at the time few believed it possible to do what she had done - it seemed like a fantasy world, completely detached from how things had been done post war.",
      "I was six when the war ended. There was rationing \u2013 coupons that allowed you to buy meat or clothes, or of course, sweets. But out of these hard times and on the heels of victory, a new vision of society was emerging in Britain.",
      "With Clement Attlee's landslide election victory in July 1945, for the first time in Britain's political history a majority cast their votes for a party ostensibly dedicated to socialism.",
      "But more than that, a new consensus on how the country should run emerged, with those leading the Labour and Conservative parties singing from a broadly similar sheet.",
      "\"We have built our defences against want and sickness, and we're proud of it,\" was uttered not by a Labour prime minister but by Harold Macmillan, Conservative prime minister from 1957 to 1963. This had been how things were done.",
      "However not everyone bought into the consensus. Antony Fisher, who was a chicken farmer, was exasperated by what he saw as the meddling of the Egg Marketing Board. He set up the Institute of Economic Affairs think tank, inspired Keith Joseph and he in turn got Thatcher's ear.",
      "Trump's admiration of Thatcher",
      "That the current assault on the free market is coming, in part, from a Republican US president seems all the more ironic given how popular Thatcher's reforms were with the American right.",
      "Thatcher and President Ronald Reagan shared a similar world view, and Trump has spoken of his admiration for the two, albeit with the caveat that he didn't agree with some of Reagan's trade policies.",
      "Thatcher was convinced that the country would be much better off if gas and water and electricity were taken out of the hands of the state. And sold on the open market. The free market. Just like buying a loaf of bread.",
      "The Thatcher government's big idea was that they weren't just going to sell the shares in state-owned utilities to big businesses or investors. They were going to offer them to the British people.",
      "In December 1984 shares in British Telecom (BT) went on sale. The next morning, the numbers were staggering: more than two million Britons were now BT shareholders.",
      "And Thatcher began to realise that selling off these companies wasn't just about breaking the shackles of government control. It could be something bigger - turning every person in Britain into a capitalist and in doing so making capitalism popular.",
      "In Britain, by the end of the 1980s, the scale of transformation was staggering. The sum of \u00a360bn was raised by selling off state run companies. Up to 15 million Britons were now shareholders.",
      "Britain was embracing the free market. This wasn't just an economic shift. It was a cultural revolution. A redefinition of Britain's relationship with money, with government, and with itself.",
      "And if Thatcher's privatisation had given ordinary people the chance to buy shares, her reforms to Britain's financial services sector in 1986, known as the Big Bang, gave ordinary people the chance to sell them too, to get a job in the previously closed world of the City.",
      "There were many on the left for whom the principle alone of these reforms was something to object to. The assault on the free market from some on the right is not about the principles of the reforms, but the consequences.",
      "Offshore business and collapsing communities",
      "At the core of Thatcher's thinking was a belief that free market capitalism could work only if many people had a direct stake in it. And with share ownership of previously state run utilities, many people did. But before long, alarm bells were starting to be rung. And their chime has only gotten louder.",
      "James Goldsmith was a businessman who had made a fortune by buying struggling companies cheaply, reshaping them to maximise efficiency and then selling them at a profit. The 1980s reforms were like manna from heaven for him.",
      "But then he seemed to change his mind about things. In 1994 he told a committee of US senators that its premise contained a fatal flaw - that the system demanded maximum profit but to achieve maximum profit that meant severing the umbilical link with many of your own electorate.",
      "\"You get to a system whereby, to get the best corporate profits, you have to leave your own country. You have to say to your own sales force 'Goodbye, we can't use you anymore - you're too expensive'.",
      "\"You've got unions. You want holidays. You want protection. So we're going offshore.\"",
      "Goldsmith was predicting that companies would take their business wherever they would make the most money. If you are a CEO answerable to shareholders that's literally your job description. And the result, he said, would be job losses in the West, with communities collapsing.",
      "And to make things worse, he argued that Britain had ceded sovereignty to the likes of the European Union and the World Trade Organization, with Britain binding itself to an economic system run by unelected bureaucrats in Brussels, only adding to the sense of alienation felt in collapsing communities. And with global markets dictating policy. If an industry wasn't profitable, it was left to die.",
      "Today, the UK may be a global leader in science and financial services but is that of much consolation to communities where we once made things that are now made offshore?",
      "Based on what I often heard in my many years touring the country presenting Question Time, I'm not sure it is.",
      "Goldsmith would end up trying to go into politics. His Referendum Party was trounced in the 1997 general election but he had planted a seed. He had argued that the global free market path that Britain and the rest of the world was going down was dangerous. That it would spread division around the world.",
      "Fast-forward nearly 20 years to 2016 and his warning came to pass. Britain voted to leave the European Union and the verdict could not be clearer: the Leave vote was highest in those left-behind communities, seemingly fuelled by those who felt globalisation was not working for them.",
      "The dream of a nation of shareholders has soured too.",
      "In 1989 Thames Water was privatised. We were promised lower bills, better infrastructure, less red tape and investment in a system fraying at the edges. It was investment that the global capitalist system was supposedly best placed to provide.",
      "What followed was something else entirely. Debt ballooned and dividends flowed to shareholders. The company extracted profit while pipes leaked and sewage poured into rivers. And our bills now pay for interest on that debt - it feels like we've come a long way from Thatcher's nation of shareholders.",
      "Trump's tariffs 'defy easy explanation'",
      "Back in 1994, James Goldsmith had posited that the problem with the free market dream was that it didn't protect the home base.",
      "Now, there is someone else much more powerful who takes that view.",
      "President Trump's methods are so erratic that with him it's hard to tell what is going on. His readiness to slap hugely consequential tariffs on countries that are both traditional foes and supposed friends at times defies easy explanation.",
      "But what we can say is that he is trying to return to ideas that preceded the free market. He is trying to make America strong through protectionism, making it harder for anyone to simply sell anywhere.",
      "There is an argument that if you take the long view then perhaps the free market period is the outlier. Britain itself had a long, long period of protectionism before it embraced free trade.",
      "Tariffs are nothing new in world economic history and in a sense Trump is just trying to return the US to how things were, albeit in quite a chaotic way.",
      "The reign of the free market is facing its biggest ever challenge. But that challenge is coming not from supporters of socialism who ideologically back a big role for the state. Instead, the challenge is coming from Trump, a man who is broadly speaking of the right and has no qualms with capitalism allowing people to become very rich.",
      "That the challenge is coming from within is what makes it so potent.",

      "Simone Collins is sitting in her 18th century cottage in Pennsylvania, dressed in a black pilgrim pinafore with a wide collar, bouncing one of her four children on her lap. It is 8.30am and she looks a little tired \u2013 she runs several businesses, a foundation and is currently pregnant with her fifth child, though she and her husband Malcolm plan to have more.",
      "\"At least seven,\" she declares, \"and as many as I can physically carry - 12 would be even more brilliant.\"",
      "The US couple, aged 37 and 38, ardently believe that the world needs to have more babies or risk civilisational collapse. They have become the poster children for pronatalism, a movement that believes falling birth rates are a big problem for society. And that big families are the answer.",
      "For the last five years, they have spread the word about their goal by opening up their home for interviews and photoshoots. They claim to have used special technology, during the IVF process, to screen their embryos for traits such as intelligence.",
      "\"The studies let us know what our genetic predilection for IQ is,\" they told an undercover reporter in 2023. \"We will never choose a child who is less privileged in IQ than either of us.\"",
      "Speaking today, however, Malcolm admits, \"The easiest way to [spread the word about pronatalism] was to turn ourselves into a meme... If we take a reasonable approach to things and say things are nuanced, nobody engages. And then we go and say something outrageous and offensive and everyone's into it.\"",
      "But since Donald Trump was sworn in as US President for the second time earlier this year, they have taken their evangelising to a new level. The Collinses now see certain people in the White House as potential allies - and they fully intend to capitalise on that.",
      "Elon Musk, who is said to have fathered 14 children, has called fertility decline \"the biggest danger civilisation faces, by far\". He has donated $10m (\u00a37.75m) to the Population Wellbeing Initiative in Texas, which conducts research into fertility, parenting, and the future of population growth.",
      "The US Vice President JD Vance has also spoken openly about his views on procreation. At an anti-abortion rally in January he declared: \"I want more babies in the United States of America.\"",
      "There are early indications that the Trump administration is prioritising family too. On 18 February, Trump signed an executive order to improve access for IVF that recognised \"the importance of family formation and that our nation's public policy must make it easier for loving and longing mothers and fathers to have children\".",
      "Pronatalists are buoyed by this and many hope it is a sign of things to come.",
      "The facts of fertility decline are clear. The US is at a record low of 1.62 children per woman, and by the end of the century the UN projects a majority of countries will have a shrinking population. That will have a profound effect on society and our economies. Some people believe we can adapt over time to this new reality, but pronatalists are less sanguine.",
      "But there is a political element to the movement too. Pronatalists are almost exclusively from the political right. Malcolm and Simone Collins, for example, describe themselves as former liberals who became disillusioned with progressive, \"woke\" politics.",
      "They see themselves as pragmatic and profoundly anti-bureaucratic.",
      "\"We are a coalition of people who are incredibly different in our philosophies, our theological beliefs, our family structures,\" says Malcolm. \"But the one thing we agree on is that our core enemy is the urban monoculture; the leftist unifying culture.\"",
      "So, could this fringe group really gain the ear of some of the most powerful people in the US government? And if so, just how much soft power could they have to influence policy not only around population decline but about wider issues too?",
      "Vance, Musk and the 'Fertilisation President'",
      "Last weekend, a group of roughly 200 pronatalists congregated in Texas for the second Natal Conference, an annual weekend-long event that cost around $1,000 (\u00a3775) to attend.",
      "The conference brings together two strands in pronatalism that come from very different branches of the American right: both conservative Christians and members of the so-called 'tech right,' an ascendant wing that came out of the libertarian, start-up culture of Silicon Valley.",
      "Some are connected to the current US government. Michael Anton was appointed by Trump as the Director of Policy Planning at the State Department. He spoke at last year's conference.",
      "Other speakers at this year's conference included Carl Benjamin, who has links to far-right activist Tommy Robinson, and Charles Cornish-Dale, an influencer who goes by the name Raw Egg Nationalist.",
      "\"It's like an unholy alliance,\" says Catherine Pakaluk, an economist, mother of eight and stepmother of six. She too spoke at the conference but is reluctant to call herself a pronatalist. \"It's a complicated movement and includes people with very different positions,\" she says.",
      "One thing they have in common, however, is that they all want their message to be heard at the highest levels of government.",
      "Some believe they already are being heard. \"[If you ask me] do we have pronatalists in the White House right now who are pushing policy,\" says Malcolm, \"my response to this would be, 'I mean, duh, like Elon and JD Vance'.\"",
      "In President Trump's executive orders to date, there has been little apart from the order on IVF that could be seen as directly pro-family. But pronatalist thinking may be starting to influence policy that is less explicitly about fertility.",
      "In January, the US transportation secretary Sean Duffy circulated a memo instructing his department to \"give preference to communities with marriage and birth rates higher than the national average\" when awarding grants.",
      "Roger Severino, Vice-President of Domestic Policy at right-wing think tank the Heritage Foundation, sees the influence of JD Vance in that policy. \"Vance comes at it from a long history of pro-family thinking and policymaking,\" he says.",
      "Vance has often spoken about the need to fix a \"broken culture\" that is tearing the US family apart, by undermining men.",
      "In a recent interview, he said: \"We actually think God made male and female for a purpose and we want you guys to thrive as young men and young women and we're going to help with our public policy to make it possible to do that.\"",
      "This idea has been echoed in pronatalist circles.",
      "\"Vance is a vocal pronatalist,\" says Rachel Cohen, policy correspondent at Vox. \"Trump himself campaigned on implementing a new \"baby boom\" and last week he declared himself the 'fertilisation president'.\"",
      "The pronatalists drafting DIY executive orders",
      "Malcolm says he has already made attempts to influence the White House. He claims to have engaged in \"backroom channelling of influential people, making sure that pronatalism became normal to talk about within the centres of power, and that ended up dripping its way up to administration and core tech culture\".",
      "They are in discussions on pronatalist policy with the Heritage Foundation. Then there is a rather more direct approach they claim to have taken. \"We have submitted draft executive orders to the Trump administration,\" says Simone.",
      "Their proposals include suggestions for how to remove layers of regulation from childcare providers and expanding car seat choice so cars can fit more children.",
      "The couple aren't sure if those are going to translate into anything concrete just yet \u2013 but they believe they have a receptive audience.",
      "Their connection to power is thanks to the so-called tech right, a reactionary movement against liberalism led by some of the most powerful people in Silicon Valley. Those in the tech right include Paypal co-founder Peter Thiel \u2013 who sponsored Vance's Senate race and has invested in fertility technology \u2013 and venture capitalists David Sacks and Marc Andreessen.",
      "Simone Collins was formerly the managing director of an exclusive members' club run by Mr Thiel, and the couple say they ran two other invite-only networking groups for business elites. Their Pronatalist Foundation, founded in 2021, received just under $500,000 (\u00a3387,000) through a fund of the Skype co-founder, Estonian billionaire Jann Tallinn.",
      "\"The tech right bring a lot of energy to the discussion,\" says Roger Severino, Vice-President of Domestic Policy at the Heritage Foundation. \"We've been discussing how we could blend these various strains on the right. We're trying to cohere the movement.\"",
      "Cracks in the pronatalist alliance",
      "There are, however, cracks in the alliance which add to the challenge of trying to make the movement \u201ccoherent\u201d.",
      "Many on the traditional religious right have misgivings about the use of IVF and disagree with embryo screening, while some also oppose gay marriage and parenthood.",
      "\"It's just an odd alliance of people who seem to agree on this one point: that the birth rate is too low. But there are wildly different prescriptions and ideas about what might be done to fix it,\" says Ms Pakaluk.",
      "\"There's a renewed interest in pronatalism and family promotion among American conservatives,\" says Timothy Carney, author of Family Unfriendly, How our Culture Made Raising Kids Much Harder than it Needs to Be. But he adds: \"There will definitely be tensions.\"",
      "One of those most divisive issues in pronatalism are the mention of certain aspects related to genetics among some of its tech right proponents. It's something that has prompted concern, in particular around the ethics of this, on all sides of the political spectrum.",
      "Patrick T Brown, a fellow at the right-leaning American Ethics and Public Policy Centre working on pro-family policy, suggests that the executive order to improve access to IVF could show the influence of the tech-right on policy. But he has his concerns about that influence, particularly around embryo screening. \"Turning children into consumer products is something that I really worry about,\" he says. \"That leads to a troublesome place.\"",
      "Some of those attending the recent conference describe themselves as \"race realists\", and one has published offensive views alleging a link between intelligence and race that, according to many scientists, are plain wrong.",
      "Geneticist Adam Rutherford describes the data used as \"fraudulent and racist, drawn from hopeless sample sizes that wouldn't constitute valid scientific evidence to anyone vaguely interested in truth.",
      "\"These assertions are recapitulations of historical ideas of scientific racism.\"",
      "The associations with extreme views in the movement is one of the reasons some people don't like to call themselves pronatalists. Catherine Pakaluk is one of them. \"I think there probably are some people who are just pure eugenicists or white supremacists,\" she says.",
      "\"I find it disgusting and reprehensible and I have no interest in ever being aligned with people like that.\"",
      "Could controversy translate into soft power?",
      "The question that remains is, where does all of this leave pronatalists - and just how much power do they wield?",
      "According to some onlookers, their impact is already being felt. \"There's definitely strong influence from pronatalists in the Trump White House,\" claims Ms Cohen. \"I think an outstanding question is how this will all overlap with efforts to restrict birth control and contraception, and how this will affect debates around spending like on childcare funding.\"",
      "Mr Carney is more circumspect: \"Vance is very pro-family and very pronatalist, and he wants the government to promote families and to help drive up the birth rate - but JD Vance is not the president. I don't think Donald Trump has firm conviction on this.\"",
      "He also believes there might be resistance to some pro-family policies, pointing out that at least some of the Republicans in control of Congress don't like the idea of family support. \"They think that it's welfare to the undeserving.\"",
      "The attention gleaned by the Collinses, and by the recent conference, is undoubtable. But one expert suggests they are doing little more than stirring up controversy.",
      "\"If you go to Capitol Hill, and talk to members of Congress or governors in states across America, they don't necessarily even recognise the problem,\" argues Mr Brown.",
      "As he puts it, \"the incentives of the internet\" aren't always the incentives of a successful mass movement. \"And what gets attention is provocation and being edgy and crossing the line. That gets clicks, that gets followers.",
      "\"[But] that to me is not how you end up changing the political dynamics.\"",

      "In front of a packed court room, with headteachers and students in school uniforms listening from the public gallery, Lord David Pannick KC, argued the policy is discriminatory.",

      "Lord Pannick, one of the country's leading barristers in cases relating to government decisions, said the families he is representing \"are not wealthy\".",
      "Two of the claimants have no alternative schools in their area to meet the needs of their children who have SEND, the court heard.",
      "Another family sent their child to a single sex independent primary school after they experienced \"harassment\" in their previous co-educational school.",
      "Lord Pannick argued that adding VAT to their fees impedes their right to access education and the policy is \"unprecedented\" in all other Council of Europe states.",
      "Around a quarter of families affected by the VAT changes fall below the average wealth level, and the policy has been brought in \"irrespective of the needs of the child\" or of the ability of the family to pay, he told the court.",
      "Lord Pannick is leading the challenge for the Independent Schools Council (ISC) which represents more than 1,400 private schools. There are two further claims also being heard by a group of faith schools and the parent-led group Education not Discrimination.",
      "They are seeking a declaration of incompatibility with Article 2 of the First Protocol of the European Convention on Human Rights, which is the right to education, and that the policy is also discriminatory.",
      "It is \"not good enough\" for the government to say \"it has been debated in Parliament\" and will \"raise revenue\", Lord Pannick argued, stating that the policy needed stricter scrutiny.",
      "Barristers representing Chancellor Rachel Reeves, along with HMRC and the Department for Education (DfE), are due to give their side of the case on Wednesday.",
      "In his written submission, Sir James Eadie KC, representing the government, said parents wishing to opt out of \"universally accessible state-funded education\" are free to choose \"any private education for their child that they can afford\", or they can \"educate their child at home\".",
      "Sir James will argue that taxes, minimum wage laws and national insurance, which all affect the cost of private school fees, do not interfere with \"with freedom to offer or receive private education.\"",
      "SEND pupils who have an education, health and care plan which names a private school have their fees paid for by their local council.",
      "Sophie Kemp from the law firm Kingsley Napley is representing the ISC families and told the BBC: \"It's particularly difficult for those who may have SEND and/or religious convictions where the state can't meet those needs.\"",
      "She added: \"For example children with very complex needs have had many failed placements, including in the state sector, and then that leaves them in a difficult position because their educational needs cannot necessarily be met by going to the state sector, and that's how the policy has a discriminatory impact on children with those types of needs.\"",
      "Speaking outside court, Caroline Santer, headteacher at the King's School in Hampshire, said she was hopeful the review would change things as they had a \"strong argument\".",
      "Ms Santer said the primary school, where fees start at \u00a37,258, charges less than it costs the government to put a child in state school \"saving the government a lot of money\".",

      "If you are struggling to pay your household bills, don't panic, says Richard Lane, chief client officer at the StepChange Debt Charity. He suggests creating a detailed budget that captures all your income and expenditure.",

      "Normal People and Gladiator II actor Mescal will portray Sir Paul McCartney, while Saltburn star Keoghan will step into Ringo Starr's shoes.",
      "The acting supergroup will also feature Harris Dickinson, who was most recently seen opposite Nicole Kidman in Babygirl, as John Lennon.",
      "And Joseph Quinn will go from Marvel's Fantastic Four to the Fab Four, playing George Harrison in the big-screen quadrilogy, which will be directed by Sir Sam Mendes.",
      "The Oscar-winning director was joined by the four actors for the announcement at the CinemaCon convention in Las Vegas on Monday.",
      "Each film will focus on a different member of the legendary group.",
      "\"Each one is told from the particular perspective of just one of the guys,\" Sir Sam told the event. \"They intersect in different ways - sometimes overlapping, sometimes not.",
      "\"They're four very different human beings. Perhaps this is a chance to understand them a little more deeply. But together, all four films will tell the story of the greatest band in history.\"",
      "The films will be released \"in proximity\" to each other in April 2028.",
      "The director explained: \"I just felt the story of the band was too huge to fit into a single movie, and that turning it into a TV mini-series just somehow didn't feel right.\"",
      "Meet the Beatles",
      "Paul Mescal, 29, shot to fame in the BBC's Normal People in 2020. He went on to star in acclaimed films Aftersun, for which he was Oscar-nominated, and All of Us Strangers,  and he played the lead in the Gladiator sequel. As well as portraying Sir Paul McCartney, the Irish star is about to be seen as another British creative genius, William Shakespeare, in the film adaptation of award-winning novel Hamnet.",
      "Harris Dickinson has become a star thanks to Maleficent, The King's Man, Triangle of Sadness and Where the Crawdads Sing, before playing Kidman's love interest in Babygirl. The 28-year-old Brit also received a Bafta TV Award nomination for A Murder at the End of the World, and is among the bookmakers' favourites to be the next James Bond.",
      "Barry Keoghan bears perhaps the closest resemblance to his Beatle - drummer Ringo. The Irish actor is the oldest of the acting quartet at 32, and is one of the hottest stars in Hollywood, having been nominated for an Oscar for The Banshees of Inisherin before leading the cast of cult hit Saltburn.",
      "Joseph Quinn played Eddie Munson in the fourth season of Netflix's Stranger Things, was in A Quiet Place: Day One, and appeared alongside Mescal in Gladiator II. Before appearing as guitarist Harrison, the 31-year-old Londoner will be seen as Johnny Storm/Human Torch in The Fantastic Four: First Steps and two Avengers films.",
      "Although several previous movies like Backbeat, Nowhere Boy and I Wanna Hold Your Hand have depicted The Beatles, this is the first time that all four band members and their estates have granted full life story and music rights for a scripted film.",
      "Sir Sam called the films the \"first bingeable theatrical experience\", adding: \"Frankly, we need big cinematic events to get people out of the house.\"",
      "On stage, Dickinson, Mescal, Keoghan and Quinn recited from the band's song Sgt Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band: \"It's wonderful to be here, it's certainly a thrill, you're such a lovely audience, we'd like to take you home with us.\"",
      "They then gave a Beatles-style synchronised bow.",
      "Formed in 1960, the original band transformed youth culture and changed the course of musical history.",
      "Restlessly imaginative and experimental, they had an uncanny ability to communicate sophisticated musical ideas to a mass audience, on albums including Revolver, Sgt Pepper's and The White Album.",
      "Despite splitting in 1970, the quartet remain the biggest-selling band of all time.",
      "Only two members survive. John Lennon was murdered in 1980, while Harrison died of cancer in 2001.",
      "In 2023, the surviving members released what was described as the Beatles' \"final\" song, Now And Then.",
      "Based on one of Lennon's old demo tapes, and featuring an archive recording of Harrison's guitar work, it went to number one and was nominated for awards at the Brits and the Grammys.",
      "The Beatles on film",
      "This is by no means the first film project to explore the lives of The Beatles - Iain Softley's Backbeat, released in 1994, dramatised their early career in Hamburg's clubs, where they cut their musical teeth.",
      "Sam Taylor-Johnson's Nowhere Boy in 2009 starred her future husband Aaron Taylor-Johnson as Lennon and Thomas Brodie-Sangster as McCartney. It delved into Lennon's early years and family relationships, and documented him meeting McCartney and Harrison and the band's origins.",
      "Martin Scorsese made a factual film in 2011 called George Harrison: Living in the Material World, which included contributions from the surviving band members plus archive material.",
      "In 2021, Lord of the Rings director Peter Jackson restored more than 50 hours of outtakes from 1970 Beatles documentary Let It Be for Get Back, a three-part film. The epic Disney+ movie, which was nearly seven hours long, shed new light on the relationship between McCartney and Lennon before the band split in 1970.",

      "Convicted sex offender Gary Glitter has been declared bankrupt after failing to pay more than \u00a3500,000 to a woman he abused when she was 12, her lawyers have said.",
      "The disgraced pop star, whose real name is Paul Gadd, was convicted in 2015 of abusing the woman between 1975 and 1980, as well as two other young people, and was last year ordered to pay the victim damages of \u00a3508,800.",
      "The sum included \u00a3381,000 in lost earnings and \u00a37,800 for future therapy and treatment.",
      "Richard Scorer, head of abuse law at Slater and Gordon, which represents one of the victims, confirmed 80-year-old Gadd had been made bankrupt, adding he had refused to co-operate and \"continues to treat his victims with contempt.\"",
      "In a statement, he added: \"We hope and trust that the parole board will take his behaviour into account in any future parole applications, as it clearly demonstrates that he has never changed, shows no remorse and remains a serious risk to the public.\"",
      "Gadd was jailed for 16 years after his conviction in 2015, and released in February 2023 after serving half his sentence.",
      "He was returned to prison six weeks later after it was found he had breached his licence conditions by allegedly viewing downloaded images of children.",
      "The woman, who cannot be named for legal reasons, brought a compensation claim against Gadd. The High Court heard that she had been unable to work for decades due to the abuse, and had suffered lifelong mental scarring.",
      "Judge Mrs Justice Tipples ruled that Gadd had subjected the claimant \"to sexual abuse of the most serious kind\".",
      "She said she was satisfied the woman had not been able to find \"any meaningful employment throughout her life\" as a result, and awarded her damages for complex psychological therapy and treatment and loss of earnings.",
      "\"Her education was ruined and she has suffered severe psychiatric injury for the rest of her life,\" she added.",
      "In her ruling, the judge said Gadd had failed to acknowledge the compensation claim had been lodged against him - meaning he had lost the case by default.",
      "He had not responded to an offer to speak to the court on a prison video link when it came to deciding the exact amount he should pay, she added."

      "Liverpool Crown Court heard the 37-year-old thought Miss Ballas's late brother, David Rich, was his father.",
      "Shaw, who admitted stalking the 64-year-old dancer, causing her serious harm or distress between 31 August 2017 and 29 November 2023, was sentenced to 20 months, suspended for 20 months.",
      "Passing sentence, Judge Gary Woodhall said: \"This was a menacing threat against her and her family.\"",
      "Shaw, from Whetstone Lane in Birkenhead, was also made the subject of a restraining order for life.",
      "It means he will never be allowed to contact either Miss Ballas or her niece, mother or former partner.",
      "Nicola Daley, prosecuting, said: \"He believed, and it's evident from what he was told by his mother, that her late brother was his father.\"",
      "The court heard that while there was no evidence his belief was incorrect, there was only \"limited evidence\" it was correct.",
      "Ms Daley said that, in his messages, Shaw had accused Miss Ballas of being responsible for the death of her 44-year-old brother, who took his own life in 2003.",
      "The court heard Shaw also set up social media accounts in her brother's name.",
      "The prosecution said Shaw approached Miss Ballas's mother, 86-year-old Audrey Rich, when shopping in Wirral in 2019.",
      "Shaw told Ms Rich she was his grandmother and continued to follow her around the shop when she did not want to speak to him, the court heard.",
      "This incident resulted in Miss Ballas moving her mother from Merseyside to London.",
      "The court also heard Shaw posted messages on Twitter, now X, which included an image of the BBC One star's home address along with a message which said: \"You ruined my life, I'll ruin yours and everyone's around you.\"",
      "As a result of Shaw's actions, Ms Daley said Miss Ballas became reluctant to socialise with colleagues and stopped using public transport.",
      "The prosecutor added: \"She described having sleepless nights worrying about herself and her family's safety and being particularly distressed when suggestions were made to her that she and her mother were responsible for her brother taking his own life.\"",
      "The court was told in October 2020 Ballas contacted police after he messaged her and said: \"Do you want me to kill myself, Shirley?\"",
      "The court also heard Shaw sent messages to Miss Ballas's niece Mary Assall, work colleagues from Loose Women and Strictly Come Dancing as well as her former partner Daniel Taylor.",
      "He called him in November 2023 and in an \"implied threat\" told him he knew where they lived and described what he knew about the TV star's movements, the court was told.",
      "And when the Strictly judge had book signings planned in Wirral, Shaw messaged her saying: \"I can't wait to meet you for the first time Aunty Shirley. Hopefully I can get an autograph.\"",
      "Sentencing Shaw, the judge said: \"Since 2017 you have engaged in persistent, unwanted online contact with Shirley Ballas and her family. You did so because your mother told you Shirley Ballas's late brother was your biological father.",
      "\"I'm satisfied your motive for this offending was a desire to seek contact with people you genuinely believed were your family.",
      "\"Whether in fact there's any truth in that belief is difficult, if not impossible, to determine.\"",
      "He added: \"This was not an offence driven out of delusional beliefs, physical attraction or simply an obsession with a celebrity.\"",
      "'Complex mental health issues'",
      "John Weate, defending, said Shaw had suffered complex mental health issues since childhood and in his mid-to-late teens was told by his mother that David Rich was his father.",
      "Mr Weate said: \"He now accepts that Miss Ballas and her family don't wish to have any contact with him and, importantly, he volunteered the information that he has no intention of contacting them again.\"",
      "He said Shaw's use of cannabis had \"not helped him\".",
      "Shaw was ordered to do 20 days of rehabilitation activity and undertake a 12-month drug rehabilitation requirement.",
      "'Increasingly erratic'",
      "Natassia McAdam, of the Crown Prosecution Service, said: \"Kyle Shaw's attempts to contact (her) were clearly stalking.",
      "\"They were persistent and became abusive and caused anxiety and distress over a prolonged period of time.",
      "\"His behaviour became increasingly erratic, and she feared he would become violent. He knew what he was doing would cause her alarm and distress.\"",
      "Miss Ballas, originally from Wallasey, Wirral, has been head judge on the BBC show since 2017.",

    "story": [
      "Financial worries and disagreements about fundraising helped inflame the row that has engulfed the charity founded by Prince Harry, insiders close to former trustees told BBC News.",
      "An acrimonious boardroom battle has seen Prince Harry, his co-founder Prince  Seeiso of Lesotho and trustees resign from their roles at the charity and insiders claimed personality clashes and tensions around leadership of the charity added to Sentebale's challenges.",
      "The financial fears were despite the charity receiving an extra \u00a31.2m from Prince Harry's earnings from his best-selling memoir Spare.",
      "Sentebale said it had successfully hired consultants to find new US donors \u2013 and the one-off money from Spare was \"incredibly useful\"  but did not represent a long-term \"funding pipeline\".",
      "The claims and counter-claims over Sentebale are set to be examined by the Charity Commission, which will have to decide whether to escalate the concerns to a full statutory inquiry.",
      "The watchdog is likely to hear financial concerns from former trustees, who resigned earlier this month after the chair Sophie Chandauka refused to step down.",
      "\"It is devastating that the relationship between the charity's trustees and the chair of the board broke down beyond repair, creating an untenable situation,\" said a statement from those trustees leaving the charity.",
      "Among the likely claims are that \u00a3500,000 of Sentebale's money was spent on consultants in a strategy to get donations from wealthy individuals and foundations in the US, but which sources close to former trustees say had not delivered results.",
      "Insiders say that if the US fundraising strategy had worked this crisis in running the charity might have been averted.",
      "Ms Chandauka has widely used the title \"Dr\" both for the Sentebale charity and other business settings. This is a reference to an honorary award from Coventry University and is not an academic or medical qualification.",
      "A spokeswoman for Sentebale told the BBC that the use of \"Dr\" was a \"matter of personal choice\" and there was \"no legal restriction preventing honorary degree recipients from using the title\".",
      "A Sentebale spokeswoman rejected the claim that \u00a3500,000 had been spent on US consultants - and defended its approach to seeking new funds for a charity.",
      "The charity told the BBC that it had hired a US firm called Lebec to help build a new fundraising strategy, and that by October 2024 a team of six consultants had set up 65 key relationships with potential donors, who might help Sentebale in the future.",
      "It said the 12-month deal with Lebec, a women-led strategy firm, had successfully delivered links to \"high-net-worth individuals, family offices, corporations, foundations and partner non-profits\".",
      "\"Lebec provided the positioning strategy, the tools, and the insights to enter the US market successfully and with credibility,\" said a spokeswoman for Sentebale..",
      "The shift to larger-scale US funding would appear to be a different style of approach from Sentebale's fundraising polo matches and celebrity events associated with Prince Harry.",
      "Prince Harry, his co-founder Prince Seeiso of Lesotho and trustees resigned from their roles at Sentebale, as a \"result of our loss in trust and confidence in the chair of the board\".",
      "They left a charity which was set up in 2006 to help young people in southern Africa living with HIV and Aids, a project which had strong emotional ties for Prince Harry and the legacy of his mother Princess Diana.",
      "Prince Harry and Prince Seeiso said they were resigning from the charity with \"heavy hearts\".",
      "Insiders say that relationships had been \"fraught\" by last autumn.",
      "The trustees' walkout followed Ms Chandauka's refusal to step down as chair - and she responded with her own claims against her former colleagues.",
      "She accused Prince Harry of trying to oust her and said she had raised her concerns with the Charity Commission, with a \"whistleblower complaint about the bullying, the harassment and the misogyny\".",
      "Ms Chandauka argued that the controversy around Prince Harry leaving the UK had meant that he had become a barrier to funding from donors.",
      "\"It was pretty obvious to me that we had lost quite a number of corporate sponsors,\" she said in a Sky News interview.",
      "Ms Chandauka also spoke about a dispute over a video at a fundraising polo match, where it had been claimed the Duchess of Sussex was manoeuvring her out of the way during a prize giving.",
      "The body language seemed to be a sign of other tensions.",
      "\"Prince Harry asked me to issue some sort of a statement in support of the duchess and I said I wouldn't,\" said Ms Chandauka, who said she did not want the charity to be used as an extension of the publicity for the Duke and Duchess of Sussex.",
      "There were other tussles over whether Prince Harry had caused disruption by wanting to bring a Netflix TV crew to a fundraising event.",
      "But sources close to those who have left the charity do not accept that version of events.",
      "If the Charity Commission announces it is going ahead with a \"regulatory compliance case\", it will gather evidence about the claims over how Sentebale has been managed and will decide whether the investigation needs to be escalated to the next level of a statutory inquiry.",
      "Ms Chandauka has argued that the charity can continue without its founders and needs to change its focus to reflect the current needs in southern Africa. A friend of Prince Harry's says he feels as though \"he's had one of his fingers cut off\".",

      "The prime minister has told the makers of hit Netflix drama Adolescence that it was \"really hard to watch\" with his teenage children, as he hosted a Downing Street meeting to discuss the influence of toxic material online.",
      "Sir Keir Starmer said the show, about a 13-year-old boy accused of murdering a girl from his class, served as \"a torch that shines intensely brightly on a combination of issues that many people don't know how to respond to\".",
      "But he warned there was not a \"silver bullet response\" or \"some policy lever that can be pulled\".",
      "Sir Keir also welcomed a move by Netflix to make the series available to screen for free in secondary schools.",
      "The programme has sparked a national conversation about the impact of social media and \"manosphere\" influencers.",
      "Jack Thorne, who wrote the show with actor Stephen Graham, recently said the prime minister should \"rather urgently\" consider a smartphone ban in schools and a \"digital age of consent\", similar to Australia, which has passed a law banning children under 16 from using social media.",
      "Thorne and producer Jo Johnson gave their views to Sir Keir at Monday's meeting, along with charities including the NSPCC and Children's Society, and young people. Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy was also there.",
      "The prime minister told them the show was \"at times harrowing\" but had \"lit a touch paper\" under the debate about the issues.",
      "\"We've been watching with our children - my boy is 16, my girl is 14 - and I have to say, I found it really hard,\" he told BBC political editor Chris Mason.",

      "\"It's much broader than that. It's a cultural issue, and therefore we're going to have to look more broadly, work as a society on this, and discuss it, which is why I'm really pleased that Adolescence is now going to be shown in schools free because I do think young people should be watching it.\"",
      "Netflix announced that the drama would be available to all UK secondary schools through the Into Film+ schools streaming service.",
      "Asked about banning phones in schools, which has also been proposed by the Conservative opposition, he said 97% of schools were already doing that - so it was \"not, to my mind, the central issue\".",
      "\"If we're going to get to grips with this, I personally would much rather we focus on what I think is the real issue, which is, whether you're at school or elsewhere, what are you actually accessing? Because that, for me, is the critical issue,\" he said.",

      "South Korean star Kim Soo-hyun has made a tearful public statement denying allegations made by the family of actress Kim Sae-ron,  who died in an apparent suicide in February.",
      "\"I can't admit to something I didn't do,\" the 37-year-old said on Monday at a press conference in Seoul.",
      "At the centre of the controversy are two allegations: that Kim Soo-hyun dated Kim Sae-ron when she was 15 - a minor - and that his agency pressured her to repay a loan she owed him.",
      "The scandal has shocked South Korea and its entertainment industry - and has generated a backlash against Kim Soo-Hyun, whose roles in multiple hit drama series and films has made him one of its best-known stars.",
      "Kim wept as he said that although he dated the actress for a year when she was an adult, they never dated while she was underage.",
      "Monday's media conference came after weeks of accusations and counter-accusations between Kim Sae-ron's family and Kim Soo-hyun's camp in the wake of her death.",
      "The scandal broke on 10 March, less than a month after Kim Sae-ron's death. A YouTube channel, known for its controversial political content, claimed that the two had dated for six years, when she was 15. The channel has since released videos and photos it claims were taken during their relationship.",
      "Last week, the attorney representing Kim Sae-ron's family held a press conference, revealing more chat history allegedly between the two actors from 2016, when she was 16.",
      "Kim Soo-hyun's agency initially denied the allegations but later clarified that they dated, though only between 2019 and 2020, when she was an adult.",
      "The actor himself had remained silent until Monday. At the press conference, he became emotional, reiterating to reporters that they only dated as two adults.",
      "\"Many people are suffering because of me,\" he said, apologising to his fans and staff. \"I also feel sorry that the late actress [Kim Sae-ron] isn't able to rest in peace.",
      "\"I never dated her when she was a minor,\" he continued. \"Except for the fact that both of us were actors, our relationship was just like that of any other ordinary couple.\"",
      "He also explained why he denied the relationship when she uploaded a later-deleted photo of the two of them to her Instagram account in 2024 during the airing of Netflix hit show Queen of Tears, in which he played the lead role.",
      "\"I had so much to protect as its lead actor. What would have happened if I had admitted to a year-long relationship? What would happen to the actors, the staff who were working overnight and the production team who had everything staked on that project?\" he said. \"The more I thought of it, the more I thought that shouldn't be what I do.\"",
      "Any admission of a romantic relationship or a partner is still seen as scandalous to fans in South Korea's entertainment industry, where celebrities' personal lives come under intense scrutiny.",

      "Prior to that, she had been seen as one of the most promising young actresses in South Korea.",
      "At the time, she was managed by the same agency as Kim Soo-hyun, which was co-founded by his relative. Kim Sae-ron joined GoldMedalist in January 2020 and left in December 2022.",
      "Kim Sae-ron's family claimed that GoldMedalist covered the compensation for her drunk-driving incident. They allege that the agency later pursued legal action for repayment and that, while the actress asked Kim Soo-hyun for more time to settle the debt, her request went unanswered.",
      "On Monday, Kim Soo-hyun denied claims that \"she made the tragic choice because of me or my agency pressuring her over a debt\".",
      "He released a voice recording of a phone call from a year ago, allegedly between his agency and Kim Sae-ron's representative.",
      "In the recording, the CEO of GoldMedalist appears to explain that the document they sent her regarding the debt was merely for \"procedural reasons\" and that her team could take time to respond.",
      "He also accused Kim Sae-ron's family of manipulating chat records as evidence and stated that he had submitted his own evidence to the relevant authorities for verification. He urged her family to do the same.",
      "Kim Soo-hyun, 37, is an A-list actor in South Korea, known for his roles in multiple hit drama series and top-grossing movies, including My Love from the Star, Netflix's Queen of Tears, and the film Secretly, Greatly.",
      "He has also been a favourite among advertisers in the country, though many brands have now distanced themselves from him amid the controversy. On 17 March, fashion brand Prada announced that it had mutually decided to end its collaboration with him, according to Reuters. This followed similar moves from Dinto, a Korean cosmetic brand.",
      "A Disney+ show that stars Kim Soo-hyun has also been put on pause due to the scandal, according to local news outlet Yonhap.",
      "His lawyer stated on Monday that they had filed a criminal complaint against Kim Sae-ron's family and the YouTube channel operator, along with a civil lawsuit for damages worth 12 billion won.",

    "summary": "Mohanlal agrees to remove some scenes from L2 Empuraan after criticism from Hindu nationalist groups.",
    "story": [
      "Indian superstar Mohanlal has apologised and said some scenes will be removed from his new film after criticism from Hindu nationalist groups.",
      "The Malayalam-language film, L2: Empuraan, was released on Thursday and is performing well at the box office.",
      "However, it faced a backlash from Hindu groups, including members of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), over some scenes including ones seen as referring to the 2002 anti-Muslim riots in Gujarat state.",
      "\"As an artist, it is my duty to ensure that none of my films are hostile to any political movement, ideology or religious group,\" Mohanlal wrote on Facebook.",
      "\"The team of Empuraan and I sincerely regret the distress caused to my loved ones, and with the realisation that the responsibility for it lies with all of us who worked on the film, we have decided together to remove such subjects from the movie,\" added Mohanlal, who is a household name in Kerala state, which is home to the Malayalam film industry.",
      "The developments have sparked a debate around artistic freedom, with the opposition Congress and Left parties accusing the BJP of putting pressure on the filmmakers.",
      "However, BJP leaders have said that the party did not launch a public campaign against the film and that people have the right to express their views on social media.",
      "What is the movie about?",
      "L2: Empuraan is a sequel to the 2019 Malayalam political thriller Lucifer, in which Mohanlal played the role of Stephen Nedumpally, a mysterious figure who is later revealed to be the head of an international crime syndicate.",
      "The movie, directed by another Malayalam star Prithviraj, was a big hit and got mostly positive reviews.",
      "So expectations were high for L2: Empuraan, which centres on the return of Mohanlal's character as a saviour of Kerala's politics, which has fallen into the hands of corrupt and evil people.",
      "Even before its release, the film made headlines over its budget - huge for the relatively understated Malayalam film industry - and star-studded promotions.",
      "It created a buzz across Indian cities and even internationally, with opening-day shows being sold out.",
      "The film has made nearly 1.5bn rupees ($17.5mn; \u00a313.5mn) overall in its opening weekend, according to film analytics tracker Sacnilk.",
      "But the film received mixed reviews from critics.",
      "The Hindustan Times newspaper called it a film grappling with \"an identity crisis, an overlong run time and a confused mess of a script\". The Indian Express said \"the emotional depth and dramatic weight that anchored Lucifer are largely absent in Empuraan\" but praised \"Mohanlal's commanding performance\" and some other aspects of the film.",
      "What sparked the controversy?",
      "L2: Empuraan begins with the backstory of a character Zayed Masood - played by director Prithviraj - who was orphaned during riots in a place in India, with some of the details being similar to the religious violence that occurred in 2002 when Modi was chief minister of Gujarat state.",
      "The long flashback sequence shows some graphic scenes depicting Hindus committing violent crimes against Muslims during the violence.",
      "It also shows how one of the perpetrators of the violence becomes more powerful over the years and is seeking to secure a key position in Kerala's political landscape.",
      "The scenes sparked an uproar.",
      "Rajeev Chandrasekhar, the state president of the BJP, who had wished the film's team well before its release, later said that he now realised there were \"topics in the movie that disturbed Mohanlal fans and other viewers\".",
      "\"A movie should be watched as a movie. It can't be seen as history. Also, any movie that tries to build a story by distorting the truth is doomed to fail,\" he said, adding that he would not watch the film.",
      "While some state BJP leaders supported this, others criticised the makers and accused them of depicting \"anti-national themes\" in the film.",
      "The Organiser Weekly - a magazine published by the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), which is the ideological parent of the BJP - called the film a \"disturbing, divisive tale disguised as cinema\".",
      "\"Empuraan isn't just a bad film; it's an attack on faith, on political plurality and on the very soul of balanced storytelling,\" its review said.",
      "Some social media users have also called for a boycott of the film, but there has not been a large-scale online campaign or big protests against the movie.",
      "What changes would the film see?",
      "Over the weekend, Gokulam Gopalan, one of the producers of the film, said he had asked Prithviraj to make changes \"if any scenes or dialogues in Empuraan have hurt anyone\".",
      "This was followed by Mohanlal's post on Sunday which confirmed some scenes would be removed. Prithviraj shared the post on Facebook but did not offer additional comment.",
      "Some reports said the film would see as many as 17 cuts while others said a three-minute long scene would be removed and some dialogues muted. The makers have not confirmed what the changes are.",
      "The film had been cleared by India's Central Board of Film Certification - known as the censor board - which reviews movies for public exhibition. But makers have the option of resubmitting it for more cuts.",
      "Amid the controversy, L2: Empuraan has also received support from the Communist Party of India (Marxist) - which governs Kerala - and the Congress party. The two parties have a strong presence in Kerala, where the nationally powerful BJP has struggled to make inroads.",
      "Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan said the \"communal hate campaign against Empuraan and its creators is deeply disturbing\".",
      "\"Undermining creative freedom through fear and threats strikes at the very core of democracy,\" he added.",
      "\"Cinema is the work of a group of artists. Changing the content of a work of art by threatening, insulting and humiliating through social media is not a victory,\" wrote Congress leader VD Satheesan.",

      "His parents, Sophie and Martin, two professionals in their 40s, nod understandingly. They are discussing the kinds of \"big issues\" Ben's social media usage throws up, and for Ben their conversations about sex and pornography are \"the worst\".",
      "The family \u2013 minus Ben's little sister, who is too young to join the discussion \u2013 are gathered in their living room to dissect the smash-hit Netflix drama Adolescence, which they watched the previous evening.",
      "The series follows the story of 13-year-old protagonist Jamie, who is accused of murdering a female peer after being exposed to misogynistic online material and subjected to cyberbullying.",
      "Both of Ben's parents are concerned their own son's behaviour is being impacted by the material he is exposed to, and Ben, who is worried himself, is trying to set limits on his own phone use.",
      "Given their concerns, and how they overlap with the themes of Adolescence, the family agreed to watch the programme together and allowed BBC News to sit in on their discussion, which ranged from the relevance of Andrew Tate to whether boys and girls can be friends.",
      "'People just call each other virgins'",
      "Ben is sitting on the sofa in the living room scrolling on his phone before the conversation begins.",
      "The parents take their seats looking relaxed despite the difficult subjects they are about to discuss. Photos of loved ones line the bookshelves in the family's living room, and a piano stands against the wall.",
      "Sophie and Martin have worked hard to create a \"very open\" household, Sophie says, where \"all topics are on the table\". While watching the programme, Sophie made a list of things to talk about with Ben.",
      "A confident and outspoken teenage boy, Ben is well-liked by fellow pupils at his single-sex state secondary school. But the qualities that make him popular with his peers often land him in trouble with his teachers, who give him detentions or send him to isolation for making what his mother describes as \"inappropriate comments\".",
      "In the show, Jamie and his peers use language associated with the \"manosphere\" \u2013 websites and online forums promoting misogyny and opposition to feminism \u2013 and incel culture. Incels, short for involuntary celibate, are men who blame women because they are unable to find a sexual partner. It is an ideology that has been linked to terror attacks and killings in recent years.",
      "Perhaps surprisingly, \"incel\" wasn't a familiar term to Ben, and his dad Martin had to explain it as they watched the programme.",
      "\"People just call each other 'virgins'. I've not heard 'incel' before,\" Ben tells his parents. He suggests the term might have \"dropped off\" social media for young people in recent years, reflecting the pace at which the conversation moves online.",
      "Ben tells his parents there are elements of the show he recognises, including its depiction of the fights and cyberbullying at school. But he thinks it is only a \"rough picture\" of what it's like to be a teenager today, and that it was principally made for \"an adult who isn't online\".",
      "For example, it neglects to show the good side of social media alongside its dangers, he says, and some details \u2013 including the secret emoji codes one character claims children use \u2013 ring false.",
      "It is for this reason that Martin, who says he enjoyed the tense drama, also feels the show is playing on every parent's \"worst nightmare\" about their child's phone use, meaning it sometimes favours theatrics over realism in an attempt to \"shock\" adults into action.",
      "Andrew Tate, an influencer and central figure of the shadowy online world of the manosphere, is mentioned by name in the drama and has been the cause of much concern among parents and teachers. But Ben says that while Andrew Tate was \"popular\" at his school about two years ago, he is now \"old news\".",
      "Ben has noticed the way Tate combines health and wellbeing with politics. \"Some of his things, like 'exercise for an hour a day' \u2013 fair enough, that's correct. But then he combines it with far-right ideas, like 'the man should go out and work and the wife should stay at home',\" Ben says.",
      "Both parents agree that Tate is not to blame for misogyny. As far as they're concerned, he is symptomatic of \"a bigger social problem\".",
      "Can boys and girls be friends?",
      "This problem is represented starkly in the bleak picture Adolescence paints of male-female friendships in the social media age. Protagonist Jamie doesn't have any female friends, and appears to view relations with the opposite sex through a lens of dominance and manipulation.",
      "Sophie is concerned that interactions between boys and girls are distant and impersonal in Ben's peer group. She says Ben doesn't have many opportunities to mix with girls his age.",
      "And she worries her son is getting most of his information about how to interact with girls from social media. \"It's really twisted,\" she says. \"They don't know how to behave around each other.\"",
      "She asks her son a question: \"If you don't know how to talk to girls when you're feeling awkward, if you're like, 'Eurgh, I don't know how to dress', where do you go for help?\"",
      "\"Online,\" Ben says.",
      "\"So it goes full circle,\" says his mum. \"That's where they get information.\"",
      "Ben isn't embarrassed that he's \"used ChatGPT for like two years\" to get this sort of advice. \"Or TikTok,\" he adds.",
      "Drama shines light on 'growing problem' - PM",
      "Netflix drama Adolescence hailed as 'flawless' TV",
      "Netflix's Adolescence makes UK TV ratings history",
      "Sophie says Ben learned most about friendship with the opposite sex during a visit to a cousin's house, who attends a mixed school and has female friends.",
      "She recalls Ben's cousin reprimanding him after Ben asked whether the cousin was attracted to a female friend.",
      "\"I don't remember him getting annoyed with me like that, but okay,\" Ben says.",
      "They debate their varying recollections of events until they land on a version on which they can agree: \"His cousin was like, 'No, that's my friend. I don't think of them in that way,'\" Sophie says.",
      "\"That was really eye-opening for him,\" she says. Turning to Ben, she recalls: \"You came back from it, and you were like, 'It's much better [at my cousin's], girls and boys are friends.'\"",
      "Sharing intimate images",
      "In the Netflix drama, it is revealed that Jamie's victim Katie had been subjected to misogynistic bullying after a male classmate shared intimate images of her without her consent.",
      "Jamie's discussion of this incident with a child psychologist, played by Erin Doherty, is pivotal to the programme's acclaimed third episode.",
      "Ben has seen this kind of abuse of trust among his peers too. \"There's a guy near here, and [a picture of] his genitals got leaked on a massive group chat with loads of people,\" he says. \"That was a big thing on TikTok.\"",
      "The series kicks off with an episode in which police question Jamie about the sexualised images of adult women he has shared on his Instagram page, hinting at the ease with which young teenagers can access pornography.",
      "This feels familiar to Ben, who thinks porn is the \"biggest issue\" among his peer group. He knows boys who are \"addicted\" to it: \"They rely on it. There are people in my year who'll have such a bad day unless they watch it.\"",
      "Ben squirms a little while talking about pornography, staring at the wall or fiddling with his phone.",
      "He seems more comfortable talking about the other forms of concerning content young people come across online.",
      "He estimates that \"one in 10\" videos he watches on his phone contain distressing material, including scenes of extreme violence. And Ben's parents are under no illusions that their son is \"safe\" just because he is upstairs on his computer - unlike Jamie's parents in the show.",
      "What can be done?",
      "For Martin and Sophie, the solution lies in giving children better opportunities to \"participate\" in society and build their self-esteem.",
      "They say they are also keen for their son to have \"wide range\" of male role models to learn from. Ben, who has paused to check his phone several times in the course of their discussion, re-engages with the conversation.",
      "He is animated in his praise for his sports coaches, whose \"really strong morals\" he admires.",
      "The parents nod, evidently pleased by his enthusiasm. They say they pack their son's life with activities in an attempt to get him off his phone. But this is expensive, they say, and puts poorer students at a disadvantage.",
      "Sophie says of the show's main character, Jamie: \"He doesn't have sport. He doesn't feel good about himself. His dad looks away when he fails.\"",
      "Adolescence shows that children with limited opportunities to build their self-esteem are more \"vulnerable\" to the predatory messages of misogynistic influencers, Sophie says.",
      "Both parents agree tech companies, the government, schools and families all have a responsibility to offer young people a convincing alternative to the siren call of the manosphere.",
      "They insist parents can't do it alone. As Sophie says: \"It's a tsunami and someone's given me an umbrella.\"",
      "Ben thinks what happens online is too often dismissed by adults as being irrelevant to the real world. He thinks this is a mistake; social media should be treated \"like real life \u2013 because it is real life\", he says.",

    "summary": "Tech companies say AI will make productions cheaper and faster - but many in Hollywood think it will replace their jobs.",
    "story": [
      "Inside a soundstage once used by silent film stars Charlie Chaplin and Mabel Normand, Hollywood executives, actors and filmmakers sipped cocktails as they marvelled at what some say is the biggest breakthrough since the talkies: AI-generated video.",
      "But whether AI will be the future, or the end, of cinema is still up for debate.",
      "It was only two years ago that actors and writers shut down Hollywood with strikes demanding protections from AI. Now the technology is controversially creeping into TV, movies and video games. Two films honoured at the Oscars even used the technology.",
      "As a DJ played '90s hip hop, computer developers rubbed shoulders with actors and executives, in a sign of the changing power players in the industry.",
      "AI in Hollywood is \"inevitable\", says Bryn Mooser, the party's host and the co-founder of Moonvalley, which created the AI generator tool Marey by paying for footage from filmmakers with their consent. Mooser says that while AI may still be a dirty word, their product is \"clean\" because it pays for its content.",
      "\"Artists should be at the table,\" he says, adding that it's better to build the tool for filmmakers rather than get \"rolled over by big tech companies\".",
      "Artificial Intelligence has long been depicted as a villain in Hollywood. In The Terminator, AI used by the US military decides it must destroy everyone on earth.",
      "But it's AI's creators, and not the technology itself, that has received the brunt of real-life criticism. Companies use publicly available data to build their AI models - which includes copyrighted material shared online - and creators say they're being ripped off.",
      "OpenAI, Google and other tech companies are facing multiple lawsuits from writers, actors and news organisations, alleging their work was stolen to train AI without their consent. Studios like Paramount, Disney and Universal who own the copyright on movies and TV shows have been urged by writers to do the same, though none have taken legal action.",
      "\"We've all fought very hard for copyright laws, and nobody wants to see their work stolen to have somebody else profit from it,\" Mooser says.",
      "Hollywood has begun toying with the new technology. The Oscar-nominated films Emilia Perez and The Brutalist used AI to alter voices. Adrian Brody won the Academy Award for best actor, even with the help of AI to fine tune his accent when he spoke Hungarian in his starring role in The Brutalist. AI has even been used to de-age actors like Tom Hanks and Harrison Ford.",
      "The technology is seemingly everywhere. OpenAI hosted an AI film festival in Los Angeles earlier this month. Marvel directors Joe and Anthony Russo told the Wall Street Journal they plan to invest $400 million to craft AI tools for filmmakers.",
      "But the impacts on how it will alter the future of the entertainment industry remain unclear. Generative AI, for instance, allows computers to learn and solve problems in ways that can seem human \u2013 albeit much faster. And many worry about the technology replacing their jobs as AI is used to generate scripts, animation, locations, voices and human actors.",
      "If you ask OpenAI's popular chatbot, ChatGPT, which Hollywood jobs are most easily replaced by AI, background actors are top of the list as \"most vulnerable\" with \"A-List actors & directors\" considered safest because \"star power and brand recognition keep top talent irreplaceable\".",
      "At the Moonvalley party, everyone was talking about new AI technology though few wanted to speak with a reporter on record about it. But dozens of powerful people made the trek east to the hip Silver Lake neighbourhood from west Los Angeles, even though it was raining. In LA, that's remarkable.",
      "\"We're here to learn,\" said one executive who spent an hour in traffic getting to the party. \"We're not signing anything or buying anything, but we're interested.\"",
      "Mooser and his co-founder Naeem Talukdar speak passionately about how AI will transform Hollywood and allow filmmakers to create blockbuster style epics on much lower budgets. It could lead to many bad films - but it could also help discover the next Quentin Tarantino or Martin Scorsese, even if they don't have the backing of a big studio.",
      "\"This technology is utterly meaningless without the artist at the centre of it; the technology needs to ultimately be subservient to the artist,\" says Talukdar.",
      "Hollywood's foray into using AI comes as the Trump administration prepares a new AI plan for the United States.",
      "Tech companies say they can't compete with China under existing US copyright laws and that they need unfettered access to art - from Mickey Mouse to Moana to The Matrix - to train their AI models as a matter of national security.",
      "Google and OpenAI want the US government to designate copyrighted art, movies and TV shows as \"fair use\" for them to train AI, arguing that without the exceptions, they will lose the race for dominance to China.",
      "Hollywood filmmakers say tech companies are attempting to undermine the entertainment industry, which they point out supports more than 2.3 million US jobs.",
      "\"We firmly believe that America's global AI leadership must not come at the expense of our essential creative industries,\" a group of more than 400 Hollywood A-listers - led by actress/writer Natasha Lyonne who helped develop Moonvalley - wrote in an open letter to the Trump administration, which has been soliciting public comment for its AI Action Plan.",
      "The letter's signatories included A-List stars like Ben Stiller, Sir Paul McCartney, Cate Blanchett and Lilly Wachowski, who co-created The Matrix, which depicts a dystopian simulated reality where humans are enslaved by intelligent machines.",
      "Many in Hollywood remain terrified of what AI means for their futures.",
      "Outside a Disney Character Voices office earlier this month, dozens of actors picketed against video game companies for refusing to come to an agreement on using AI in video games.",
      "\"Using actual actors is the key to a lot of the drama and enjoyment that people get from video games,\" actor DW McCann said. \"People have lived experiences that AI just can't understand.\"",
      "The actors want a contract that guarantees their voices and likeness will not be used without their consent to train AI models that replace them in the future.",
      "Mooser says AI will allow filmmakers to create amazing art \u2013 if it's done right.  With humans calling the shots, he says, AI could help them create sets and worlds they couldn't easily access or invent \u2013 and to do so much faster than what they could traditionally do with computer graphics and visual effects.",

      "We see a video clip of him, aged 14, dancing to his debut single, Call Me A Mack, then watch as he transforms into a teenage heartthrob, a confessional balladeer, an EDM party-starter, and an elder statesman of R&B.",
      "He arrives from under the stage in a fog of dry ice and a cone of laser beams, apparently controlling the lights with his bare hands, before dancing to the middle of the arena with the molten fluidity of his idol, Michael Jackson.",
      "Clad in a sparkly raincoat and wide-brimmed Pharrell hat, he races through hits like Coming Home, Hey Daddy and U Make Me Wanna, backed by a funky 10-piece band and a dance team that echoes his every move.",
      "The choreography is a constant highlight. Usher's moves are so effortless that they look unrehearsed, but such ease comes at a cost: Last year, he had to postpone the start of the tour after injuring his neck in practice.",
      "At the O2, that pain seemed a distant memory, as he careened around the U-shaped stage on roller skates, pulling off a flawless moonwalk, and even freeze-framing in a handstand.",
      "He might have fumbled a hat at one point, but it was one of his dancers who came closest to calamity - losing his balance during an elaborate chair routine, sending the chair spinning across the stage.",
      "The band also suffered a mishap, missing Usher's cue to extend the intro to Superstar, and coming in four bars early. Not disastrous, but still unusual for a show on this level.",
      "The hits were punctuated by numerous interludes, narrated by Celeste, a glitch-prone \"computer driven by AI technology to help Mr Raymond tell his story\",  from teen wannabe to global superstar, against a backdrop of infidelity, tabloid infamy, redemption and survival.",
      "The problem was his songs couldn't support the weight of that story. With a few exceptions, Usher mostly sings about lusting after women in the club, and carnal pleasures in the bedroom.",
      "The result was a weirdly disconnected show, where Usher followed a moving video about his absent father with a song about his ex, which he sung while straddling a motorbike.",
      "Priapism was a running theme. Women in the audience were fed with cocktail cherries (\"oh, it's your first time?\" Usher mugged into the camera)  and part of the stage was turned into a strip club, complete with pole dancers, during Bad Girl.",
      "That sort of tongue-in-cheek raunch has been a hallmark of Usher's career, but it felt dated and shallow in a concert that promised an intimate look into his personality.",
      "Perhaps he just wanted us to know that, deep down, he really, really likes sex.",
      "Luckily, the songs still hold up. A trio of quiet storm ballads - Climax, Burn and Confessions Part II - had couples serenading each other, while a trio of women near me took the opportunity to slow dance a security guard who was mopping the floor.",
      "To his credit, Usher sang everything live, with an airy falsetto that's undiminished after 30 years on tour. During U Got It Bad, he held one sustained note for over 10 seconds.",
      "At times, he struggled to hold the audience's attention during the slow jams. The UK has always preferred him in club mode - and it was his three biggest-sellers, Yeah, OMG and DJ Got Us Falling In Love that really set the O2 alight.",
      "Strangely it was one of those empty club anthems, I Am The Party, that ultimately carried the most meaning.",
      "\"Hopefully my [music] has been something to you,\" Usher said over the introduction.",
      "\"Maybe we fell in love together, maybe we had a good time together, but something brought you here. And I just want you to know, I appreciate the connection.\"",
      "\"If I didn't have you to cheer me on, I wouldn't continue to do this.\"",
      "Pop stars say this sort of thing all the time. But as he stood at the O2, drenched in sweat, remembering the father who abandoned him and soaking up the audience's affection, Usher didn't seem to be putting on an act.",
      "By the encore, he'd given up all pretence of being a high-rolling playboy.",
      "Instead, he bounded around the stage, giddily filming the audience on his phone, as they hollered out the chorus to Without You.",
      "If only that performer had shown up earlier."

    "story": [
      "Whether you like the new Snow White film or you hate it, it's hard to escape the debate around its lead actress, Rachel Zegler.",
      "The 23-year-old star has dominated conversation about the film, as people either blame her for its poor reviews or leap to her defence, saying she's being unfairly maligned.",
      "And this debate is not new for Zegler.",
      "Way before Snow White came out, she has been at the centre of the storm, with many criticising her take on the original film and her political views, including those on US President Donald Trump and his voters.",
      "Others defended her, and expressed discomfort at seeing such a young actress suffer a pile-on.",
      "Film critic Kelechi Ehenulo calls Zegler a victim of \"culture wars\", and warns actors from underrepresented backgrounds (Zegler is Latina) often find themselves becoming \"targets for backlash\".",
      "So how did we get to this point \u2013 and where does Zegler go from here?",
      "A blame game",
      "Let's start with the film itself.",
      "Disney's live-action version of the classic fairy tale Snow White was released earlier this month, and has faced a slew of underwhelming reviews (the Observer's Wendy Ide described it as \"toe-curlingly terrible\".) US reviewers have been somewhat more positive \u2013 but despite it topping the North America box office chart, it hasn't made as much money as expected.",
      "On social media, some people have been quick to point their finger at Zegler, arguing she hampered the release.",
      "They include Jonah Platt, the son of Snow White producer Marc Platt. Earlier this week, he took aim at Zegler in a fiery social media post. It has since been deleted, but was screenshotted by multiple outlets including the New York Post.",
      "He said Zegler had \"[dragged] her personal politics\" into the film's promotional campaign, adding: \"Her actions clearly hurt the film's box office.\"",
      "Platt didn't respond to a request for comment from BBC News.",
      "The controversies started much earlier.",
      "Before the film was released, Zegler faced abuse online by people who disagreed with her casting in the role of a character deemed to have skin \"as white as snow\".",
      "Zegler made headlines after her comments, in 2022, about the original film. \"There's a big focus [in the original] on her love story with a guy who literally stalks her. Weird! So we didn't do that this time.\"",
      "Zegler also said the original film was \"extremely dated when it comes to the ideas of women being in roles of power\", adding: \"People are making these jokes about ours being the PC Snow White, where it's like, yeah, it is - because it needed that.\"",
      "Disney holds small-scale Snow White premiere amid controversy",
      "Disney holds small-scale Snow White premiere amid controversy",
      "Many saw those words as a rebuke against Disney's tradition.",
      "The Daily Mail branded it a \"woke tirade\" and an article this week in Variety said she \"trashed the beloved original Snow White\".",
      "City AM's film editor Victoria Luxford says criticism of the original film \"was never going to work out well. These films are marketed on nostalgia, on making you feel like you did when you saw the original, so to speak of it negatively seemed puzzling\".",
      "Zegler declined to comment on this piece.",
      "But Anna Smith, film critic and host of the Girls On Film podcast, told BBC News that some of the headlines may have be misleading.",
      "\"Zegler pointed out that times and attitudes have changed, and that the new Snow White has been adapted for the current age. This is the case with many remakes and reboots, many of which do not make the headlines with comments about 'woke' culture.\"",
      "Zegler's political views have also sparked a backlash.",
      "Last summer, she thanked fans for their response to the film's trailer in a post on X, adding, \"and always remember, free Palestine\".",
      "According to the Variety article, Marc Platt - mentioned above - flew to New York to speak directly with Zegler after the post.",
      "Neither Zegler nor Platt have responded to a request for a comment on that.",
      "Zegler also stoked controversy with her views after the 2024 US presidential election. Writing on Instagram, she said she hoped \"Trump voters and Trump himself never know peace\".",
      "She later apologised for what she had said.",
      "Some commend her for speaking her mind. Ehenulo says that she is \"not the first and certainly not the last actor to be speaking about politics\".",
      "And Luxford told me she was \"hard-pressed\" to imagine the film's core audience, children under 10, being swayed by her politics.",
      "But film critic Conor Riley said that her comments about Trump didn't \"help the stability of the movie's release\".",
      "He notes that Gal Gadot, who plays Snow White's stepmother, the Evil Queen, has also faced a backlash from some people. Gadot, who is Israeli, has been vocal in her support of the country.",
      "The timing of the film also didn't help, he added.",
      "\"Ultimately, [Zegler] became a lightning rod for controversy, not just due to her own actions, but because Snow White landed at the intersection of Hollywood's creative stagnation, racial politics, international conflict, and America's deep ideological divide,\" he said.",
      "'Targets for backlash'",
      "Some, like Luxford, argue that some of the pile-on comes from \"a place of prejudice\".",
      "\"She's a young Latina woman with political opinions that don't align with certain groups, who are quick to voice their anger,\" she said.",
      "Zegler is far from the first young female actress to find herself facing a toxic backlash. Recently, Stranger Things actor Millie Bobby Brown criticised press articles about her appearance, saying \"this isn't journalism, this is bullying\".",
      "Smith notes that women in positions of prominence are more likely to be targeted in this way.",
      "\"When women in the public eye are criticised, there is often bias at work. Regardless of the topic, the way it's dealt with, talked about and reported will often differ compared to the way men are treated,\" she said.",
      "Ehenulo, for her part, calls on the industry to do more to protect their stars.",
      "\"What irks me is how easy [people of colour] actors become targets for backlash on social media and yet the culture of silence from studios, news outlets and social media platforms says it all,\" she said.",
      "\"That lack of public protection... means the toxicity continues to fester and rise. It's the Wild West out there and I can't see it getting better when this has been normalised to such an extent.\"",
      "We put those claims to Disney, but they declined to comment.",
      "The big roles keep coming for Zegler. She is now signed up to star in Evita in the West End this summer, and on Friday, she made a splash in a different way - reading a CBeebies Bedtime Story.",
      "At the end of the story, Zegler tells young viewers: \"To be a powerful princess you just need to be wonderful, brilliant you!\" For some, this is a message that encapsulates Zegler herself.",
      "\"I don't know if she's going to be doing another Disney film anytime soon,\" says Luxford, \"but she's 23, she's a Golden Globe winner, and she's a very talented actor.\"",

    "summary": "The Liverpool anthem Does This Train Stop On Merseyside? is 20 years old this year.",
    "story": [
      "Ian Prowse was standing in his local pub literally crying into his beer about the end of a relationship when someone came in to tell him one of his songs had just been played on Radio 1.",
      "Told it was \"a song about a train\", Prowse, the former frontman of 1990s band Pele, was perplexed. At the time he had no record deal and the song he knew it must have been, Does This Train Stop On Merseyside? had not been released.",
      "He would then find out that BBC DJ John Peel had got hold of a copy, and had told his listeners that the song \u2013 a poignant love letter to Liverpool, warts and all \u2013 had moved him to tears.",
      "Twenty years on from its release, it has been covered by Irish folk star Christy Moore, championed by Elvis Costello, and has become an anthem for the city - not least for its raw reflections on the Hillsborough disaster of 1989, whose 36th anniversary will be commemorated this month.",
      "Prowse, now 61, had been the frontman of the 1990s band Pele, and was playing with his new outfit Amsterdam when Does This Train Stop On Merseyside? came to him as he sat at home one afternoon.",
      "The inspiration came from the story of William McKenzie, a Victorian merchant who rests in a pyramid-shaped tomb in the graveyard of St Andrew's church in Liverpool, supposedly buried sitting upright clutching a winning hand of cards.",
      "From that germ of inspiration, which gave the song its opening lines, the rest of the verses quickly flowed.",
      "\"I was on the floor at this point,\" he says. \"The music industry had changed with the likes of the X Factor, and if you were over 30 you were essentially dead in the water.",
      "\"I was really struggling, and then John Peel started playing the song and then suddenly we had a record deal again.\"",
      "The song was to receive an even bigger break when Irish folk star Moore came across it after a gig in Manchester, when a CD containing it was posted through the open window of his car by a fan as he left the Bridgewater Hall.",
      "\"By the time we got to London, I was in love with the song,\" says Moore.",
      "\"One of the great privileges of my life has been that I get to sing the songs of people like Ian Prowse.\"",
      "For Elvis Costello, some of the song's charm lies in Prowse's \"acute sense of the history of the city\".",
      "There are references in Does This Train Stop On Merseyside? to the Atlantic slave trade, of which Liverpool was the home; the influx of Irish immigrants fleeing the potato famine of the 1840s and 1850s, and the events of 15 April 1989, reflected in the lyrics \"Yorkshire policemen fold their arms while people try and save their fellow fans\".",
      "Prowse adds: \"For people of my generation. Hillsborough was the central event. I had so many friends who were survivors, I could not write a song that's talking about Liverpool without including that.",
      "\"For the city it was a double tragedy: there was the horror of 97 people losing their lives, then there was the city being smeared in the media.",
      "\"There's still righteous fury about that in the city, and although the truth has come out, there's never been any justice really.\"",
      "Journalist Paul Du Noyer, who has written extensively about Liverpool and the Beatles, says of the song that it manages to encompass \"the very worst things in human history to the sheer fun of being out in Mathew Street\".",
      "He adds it \"ranked as one of the great Liverpool songs in that it was explicitly about Liverpool in the way that \u2013 to put it in distinguished company \u2013 Strawberry Fields Forever was, and Penny Lane\".",
      "For Prowse, who on 12 April will be performing the song at The Arts Club in Liverpool with the full seven-piece Amsterdam band to mark the 20th anniversary of its release, it is always humbling to see how well the song is received both on Merseyside and further afield.",
      "\"It's great to see how it travels so well,\" he says. \"It's always people's favourite song of mine whether I'm playing in Dublin or Glasgow, but also if I'm doing acoustic shows in Stroud or Perth or wherever.\"",
      "But there is no doubt that the most full-throated appreciation comes when Does This Train Stop On Merseyside? is played to a home crowd that knows the city and feels about it the way Prowse himself does.",
      "\"For all the darkness, and the bad things that have happened, it's still my favourite place in the whole world and it's somewhere I'd rather be than anywhere else,\" he says.",
      "\"The spirit, the heart of the place is amazing, and not necessarily despite of the bad things that have happened, but in some ways because of them.\"",

      "George Richard Chamberlain was born on 31 March 1934, in Beverly Hills, California. He died one day before his 91st birthday.",
      "His salesman father had a problem with drink, which affected young Richard's childhood. He described himself as a \"shy, serious, lugubrious kid, painfully thin, with a long, sad face\".",
      "He admitted to being the most \"uncooperative kid in school\" but discovered a taste and a talent for athletics.",
      "At Pomona College, he was bitten by the acting bug - and a role in Bernard Shaw's Arms and the Man convinced him he had found his calling.",
      "Paramount Studios was interested in him, but thoughts of an acting career were put on hold after he was called up, serving 16 months with the US Army, rising to the rank of sergeant while stationed in Korea.",
      "On his discharge, he made a number of cameos in TV shows, including an episode of the popular Western, Gunsmoke.",
      "Not everyone had Chamberlain picked as a future star.",
      "He was handsome enough: with profiles at the time gushing over his \"fine-lined aristocratic face, suggesting a young Florentine noble - straight out of the Renaissance\".",
      "But, he was naturally diffident - which worked in his favour when he auditioned to play Dr James Kildare, a medical intern struggling to learn his profession, in NBC's new primetime medical drama.",
      "\"Perhaps it was inevitable,\" said one friend-and-rival. \"Who else could look so anti-sceptic as Dick?\"",
      "The series ran for nearly 200 programmes across five seasons.",
      "It broke new ground, by raising matters such as drug addiction - which had not previously been shown on US TV.",
      "There was a huge reaction from female fans.",
      "Chamberlain got 12,000 letters a week. In Pittsburgh, 450,000 people turned out to see him at a parade, and in New York, he nearly caused a riot when a child spotted him and called his name.",
      "The studio made the most of this attention, releasing novels, comics and games featuring Chamberlain's image.",
      "Fans would even write in asking \"Dr Kildare\" to solve their various medical problems.",
      "And Chamberlain had an unlikely hit single: Three Stars Will Shine Tonight, where romantic words were added to the show's distinctive opening theme tune.",
      "He won a Golden Globe Award for best TV actor in 1963. But, three years later audiences began to wane, and NBC pulled the plug.",
      "Now an international star, Chamberlain struggled to leave Kildare behind.",
      "In 1966, he hoped to break into films, but reviews slated his performance in the light romantic comedy, Joy in the Morning.",
      "Audiences, they said, laughed in \"all the wrong places\". So, he resolved to ignore Hollywood and make a living on the stage.",
      "He got off to a rocky start when a musical version of Breakfast at Tiffany's - in which he starred opposite Mary Tyler Moore - closed after just four shows.",
      "The production is still seen as one of Broadway's biggest ever turkeys. But a move to England gave him a chance of reinventing himself as a 'serious actor.'",
      "In 1967, there were starring roles in Henry James' Portrait of a Lady and opposite Katherine Hepburn in a satirical comedy called The Madwoman of Chaillot.",
      "And, two years later, he became the first American to play Hamlet at the Birmingham Repertory Theatre since the great John Barrymore in 1925.",
      "This time, the reviews were excellent and he revisited the role of Denmark's most tortured prince for a television version for Hallmark.",
      "But Chamberlain was cast as Tchaikovsky in Ken Russell's overblown biopic, The Music Lovers, in which he starred opposite Glenda Jackson.",
      "The critics rubbished the film, in which great play was made of the relationship between a composer with repressed homosexual tendencies and his nymphomaniac wife, although it later became something of a cult success.",
      "Chamberlain went on to play Lord Byron opposite Sarah Miles in Lady Caroline Lamb and the swashbuckling French swordsman Aramis in Richard Lester's The Three Musketeers.",
      "He also appeared - along with half of Hollywood - in the Towering Inferno, as a crooked electrical engineer whose corner-cutting leads to the spectacular destruction of a 138 floor building.",

      "In the 1990s, Chamberlain's career began to wane.",

      "In 2003, long after he had stopped playing romantic leading men, Chamberlain published his biography Shattered Love, in which, for the first time, he confirmed he was gay.",
      "Despite a relationship of more than 30 years with the actor and director Martin Rabbett, with whom he'd once starred in the film Allan Quatermain and the Lost City of Gold, they had kept their private life private.",
      "\"I thought there was something very, very deeply wrong with me,\" he said, \"and I wanted to cover it up. I remember making a pact with myself that I would never, ever reveal this secret, ever.\"",
      "Chamberlain and Rabbett went their separate ways in 2010.",
      "In later years, Chamberlain was happy to play a gay man, notably in Desperate Housewives and Will & Grace.",
      "He continued to perform in musical theatre, including touring productions of Spamalot, My Fair Lady and The Sound of Music.",
      "But he never regretted hiding his sexuality to protect his career.",
      "\"I would have been a happier person being out of the closet and being free,\" he told El Pais in 2024. \"But I had other motives that made me happy. I was a working actor and for me, that was most important.\"",
      "He will be remembered as the king of the TV mini-series: the dashing leading man in everything from Dr Kildare to The Thorn Birds.",
      "Despite attempts to reinvent himself as a serious stage actor, he was at his best on the small screen, entertaining millions watching at home on the sofa.",
      "For, although there were always better actors than Richard Chamberlain, few rivalled his ability to hold a television audience."

      "Then, as now, they're an exceptionally cute couple \u2013 tender and funny and clearly besotted with one another. When they started posting videos of their romance online, people wanted to see more. In a span of six months, Warren gained more than a million followers on YouTube.",
      "Combined with the prank videos he'd filmed with his friends, he built a big enough audience to start earning money.",
      "\"When I got my first cheque for $2,000 in a month, I was like, 'Holy cow, this is gonna change my life',\" he recalls.",
      "Some of that money went into the creation of the Hype House in 2019. Warren came up with the name, and moved into the property with Annon and a bunch of young internet stars like Addison Rae, Charlie D'Amelio, Chase Hudson and Thomas Petrou.",
      "The collective introduced themselves in December 2019 with a photoshoot that mimicked Backstreet Boys video for I Want It That Way.",
      "By the end of the day, the hashtag #hypehouse was trending, and the mansion quickly became an incubator for viral videos.",
      "The enterprise thrived during lockdown but, as individual members signed TV deals, or grew tired of the escalating demands for content, it started to fall apart. Warren and Annon left in 2022, citing a desire to \"move on to the next chapter in their lives\".",
      "Since then, rumours have swirled about behind-the-scenes drama at the house, with some members hinting at exploitation and mistreatment.",
      "\"There was falling out,\" Warren told the Zach Sang show in 2023. \"But a lot of us signed NDAs, so no-one's going to talk about it.\"",
      "He did, however, pour his frustrations into music.",
      "\"How do you sleep at night?\" he sings on the angst-ridden Burning Down, a song allegedly targeted at one of the Hype House's co-founders.",
      "\"It scars forever when someone you called your friend / Shows you the truth can be so cold.\"",
      "Warren says he never made money from the Hype House. What it did give him, however, was a built-in audience for his music.",
      "\"I think that's really rare,\" he says. \"Usually, when someone goes from social media to music, they lose that fan base.",
      "\"But I think a lot of people watched my YouTube videos because they were having a rough life and needed an escape. So when I started making music about my rough life, I think they identified with it even more.\"",
      "Warren dreamt of a music career long before he entered the Hype House. Back when TikTok was called Music.ally, he'd even created a burner account to share his songs.",
      "\"I didn't want to post on my main account, because I was terrified of failing,\" he explains.",
      "\"As a kid, people bullied me for singing and doing talent shows and dedicating songs to my fifth grade girlfriend, you know?",
      "\"So I posted on a random account I created, and I filmed myself singing on the toilet because I wanted to show I wasn't taking it seriously.",
      "\"And the next day, I woke up and had 10 million views.\"",
      "His first release was 2021's One More I Love You, a song he started when he was 13 years old and coming to terms with his father's death.",
      "\"I watched my sister go to a daddy-daughter dance without her dad, and that's when I realised, 'Oh, wait, my life is different',\" he recalls.",
      "\"I started mourning for the first time, and I didn't know how to process it, so I just went to the piano and played some chords. And that's kind of where I started learning how to write.\"",
      "Warren's outpouring of grief is powerful in its simplicity, but it has touched people in ways he couldn't have anticipated.",
      "\"The other day, a woman wanted me to sign a Heinz Beans t-shirt,\" he says. \"I giggled because I thought that was funny, then she turned it over, and it was the same t-shirt her son wore right before he died from cancer.",
      "\"One More I Love You was the song that she played at that funeral and the song she listened to help her get over it.\"",
      "\"I think that's the most powerful thing in the world.\"",
      "The musician, who was raised a Catholic, believes that healing moments like those are part of God's plan for him.",
      "\"Without all the loss, all the trauma, all the things in my life, I wouldn't have these songs. I wouldn't have the means to help the 5,000 people coming to the show tonight, I wouldn't be able to provide for my future family with my wife.",
      "\"And I think those are all things that are meant to happen, or can happen if I make the  right choices.",
      "\"You know, I could have chosen to get into drugs and be a bad person but I chose this path.",

    "story": [
      "Failing to properly diagnose and treat people with bipolar disorder is wasting billions of pounds a year in the UK, according to new data shared exclusively with the BBC. Experts say many of the estimated million people living with this condition are \"ghosts in the system\", whose lives are being torn apart by poorly managed extreme suicidal lows or manic, erratic highs.",
      "Emma was diagnosed with bipolar disorder in her early 30s, after experiencing a mental health crisis.",
      "When she was 32 weeks pregnant, her grandmother died unexpectedly, sending her into a \"deep low\". \"I felt awful, but the perinatal team wouldn't take me on,\" she says. \"They said my symptoms weren't that serious.\"",
      "When Emma gave birth, the extreme lows of her pregnancy were replaced by an unexpected high. She felt amazing in the days after her baby was born - but she didn't sleep and her behaviour became increasingly erratic.",
      "A few weeks later, her mood flipped again. When her baby was three weeks old, Emma took an overdose.",
      "It took a week in hospital for her liver function to return. But even after that, she was in and out of hospital for a year before finally being diagnosed with bipolar disorder, and medicated correctly.",
      "\"If I had the correct care, and been listened to during my pregnancy or even earlier, I could have avoided taking that overdose - 100%,\" she says.",
      "It wasn't Emma's first experience of poor mental health - she'd spent her teens seeing doctors and receiving different antidepressants. No one had ever suggested she might have bipolar disorder.",
      "Experts have told the BBC how most people living with bipolar disorder in the UK are \"undertreated, undiagnosed and left to try and survive in a system that has failed them\".",
      "The majority who, like Emma, are eventually diagnosed with bipolar disorder, are incorrectly prescribed antidepressants initially, which may make their symptoms worse rather than better. Experts also say there is a lack of continuity of care from GPs through to psychiatrists.",
      "Their warning comes as data exclusively shared with the BBC suggests the cost of the condition in the UK is now an estimated \u00a39.6bn a year. That equates to more than \u00a3300 per taxpayer.",
      "This breakdown includes NHS costs, such as GP services, psychiatrist appointments and visits to A&E and hospital admissions. It also includes economic costs, such as lost days at work and the need for family and friends to take time off to provide informal care.",
      "But it does not include welfare payments for those out of work, or costs for police services dealing with people in crisis.",
      "'Common, complex and costly'",
      "\"This nearly \u00a310bn figure is actually quite conservative,\" says Prof Judit Simon, from the Medical University of Vienna, who worked with the BBC to generate the number.",
      "\"If this is a government that really wants to try and bring down the welfare bill, then bipolar disorder should be its absolute priority, the target disorder to actually move the dial.\"",
      "The data suggests up to 372,000 people with bipolar disorder are currently out of work, with some claiming benefits in the UK.",
      "For a treatable disease, this number could be slashed if the correct care was on offer, say experts.",
      "Prof Guy Goodwin, emeritus professor of psychiatry at University of Oxford, says: \"If you want to cut the costs of a disease, you need to reduce hospital admissions and emergency care. If you don't focus on cutting hospital admissions then you waste money.\"",
      "According to the Royal College of Psychiatrists (RCPsych), bipolar disorder is a manageable condition.",
      "Dr Trudi Seneviratne, registrar at the RCPsych and a commissioner on the Bipolar Commission, says it is \"completely treatable\" with a combination of medication, talking therapies and lifestyle factors.",
      "\"But there are many, many people who are suffering in silence with lower levels of symptoms because there isn't a good clinical care pathway for them in the UK.\"",
      "She says if care for bipolar disorder was fit for purpose, it would cut \"the cost to society\" as well as reducing \"the human suffering this disease unnecessarily causes\".",
      "It is this sense of waste - with people who could be leading a good life but aren't - that angers experts most, who say it is a neglected diagnosis.",
      "Prof Allan Young, from Imperial College, says: \"Bipolar is common, complex and costly - but it is so often unrecognised.",
      "\"People know it is there but somehow people are just not being cared for correctly.\"",
      "This lack of correct care is what Rosie says resulted in her being arrested at Stansted Airport for jumping the security barriers during a manic episode in her early 20s.",
      "\"I was utterly delusional,\" she says. Following her arrest, Rosie was taken to A&E and locked in a room. She waited there for more than 12 hours while a bed at a specialist mental health unit was found.",
      "Like Emma, Rosie had been dealing with mental health issues since childhood, but it was only after being in crisis that her condition was recognised. This particular period of psychotic mania had been triggered by a relationship breakdown.",
      "She was sectioned and hospitalised for three months, after which she finally began finding a combination of medications that worked for her.",
      "Now 29, Rosie says she still has high and low periods, but adds that she is far more stable and is able to work part time.",
      "\"I was failed,\" she says. \"I'm told my symptoms were a textbook case for bipolar lows and highs \u2013 energetic, grandiose language, erratic \u2013 but no one even considered this diagnosis for me until I was sectioned.\"",
      "Costs could be halved",
      "The Maudsley Hospital, in South London, has an intensive specialist care programme for its sickest, most regularly relapsing bipolar patients. The service aims to try and stop patients hitting crisis point.",
      "Similar to services offered in other European nations, the hospital provides group sessions for patients and their families. The classes help patients to understand when an episode might be starting and then contact the service once they spot early warning signs.",
      "They can then attend an outpatient clinic and adjust medications. The relatively cheap programme has seen re-admission rates to hospital fall by 80% as intervention takes place before a crisis.",
      "Prof Young says costs associated with bipolar disorder could be halved with more specialist care programmes.",
      "\"Undoubtedly, specialist treatment could contribute to getting lots of people back into work. And we know that work is very good for helping people recover from episodes of mental ill health.\"",
      "However, many experts say patients still face a postcode lottery about whether they can see a psychiatrist at all.",
      "Carolyn Chew-Graham, a GP and professor of general practice research at Keele University, says those who are acutely unwell will be picked up quickly by crisis teams but those with \"less florid manic episodes\" can miss out on referral to specialists for diagnosis.",
      "\"There's a high threshold of referral,\" Prof Chew Graham says. \"People really have to be quite unwell before they are seen in specialist services\". She says GPs may be reluctant to refer patients - even if they strongly suspect they have bipolar disorder - for fear they will be rejected.",
      "\"GPs may think I won't even consider bipolar because if I mention it to the patient and then I can't get them seen, I am a bit stuck\".",
      "Prof Young says bipolar patients need long-term specialist care.",
      "\"But that's the frustration here - even though there is strong evidence that specialist care improves the outcomes for the patient, and costs the state less, there are still so few bipolar specialist facilities.",
      "\"It's a tragedy.\"",
      "An NHS spokesperson said bipolar disorder could often take time to diagnose because it affected everyone differently and the symptoms were similar to other mental health conditions.",
      "\"NHS staff are working incredibly hard to get people diagnosed and reduce waiting times for care.",
      "\"Staff are treating a million more people than they were six years ago and are working to transform services alongside this demand \u2013 this includes strengthening community services, trialling new 24/7 open access mental health centres and rolling out mental health crisis lines.\"",

      "But a new study suggests that the synthetic hair many black women use to achieve this style could be bad for their health.",
      "The US non-profit organisation Consumer Reports tested samples from ten of the most popular brands of synthetic braiding hair, and found that all of them contained carcinogens, and in some cases, lead.",

      "But he also emphasised that more research was needed, saying: \"We're hoping that this begins the conversation, not only at the regulatory level, but also amongst our own communities, about sharing accurate information.\"",
      "Here at Jos\u00e9e's Professional Braiding Studio in north London, the study certainly isn't putting clients off.",

      "\"A lot of women I've spoken to about it have agreed that biogradable would be better - it's good for the planet as well.\"",

      "\"We launched in the pandemic, and people were like, 'Oh, but salons are closed', but we were selling out because people don't stop doing their hair.\"",
      "She tells me that black women \"got to experiment\" more with their hair during lockdown and were more willing to try out new products.",
      "One of the biggest draws of traditional synthetic hair brands, however, is their low price, which has made experimenting with different styles and colours affordable for years.",
      "But newer brands tend to have a higher price point - Tendai tells me that Ruka's most popular synthetic hair type costs around 2.5 times more than several high street brands.",
      "Ifeanyi says that, as a student, brands like Ruka are out of reach for her: \"To purchase the hair is equivalent to the amount it would cost you to get the hairstyle done, so you're essentially doubling the price.\"",
      "Tendai defends this by comparing it to choosing between \"fast food and healthy food\".",
      "She adds: \"You can actually reuse our products if you'd like, and therefore you're saving money in that way.\"",
      "Back at Jos\u00e9e's salon, Naomi tells me that braiding is not just an important source of income, but a valued cultural practice that brings her family together.",
      "\"I call myself a braid baby because I've been braiding since I was 6 years old,\" she says, telling me how her family would bond over the skill as her mum proudly looks on.",
      "\"It's an empowering service to offer,\" she adds, saying that it's gratifying to do a job that leaves other women feeling uplifted.",

      "The UK has so far failed to negotiate an exemption, but Sir Keir said talks on a deal that could eventually see them overturned were at an \"advanced stage\".",

    "story": [
      "The government's policy of adding VAT to private school fees will \"interfere with the fundamental right to education\", the High Court has heard.",
      "In front of a packed court room, with headteachers and students in school uniforms listening from the public gallery, Lord David Pannick KC, argued the policy is discriminatory.",
      "The legal challenge is being brought by families who say their needs \"cannot be adequately met in the state sector\" including those who have children with special educational needs and disabilities (SEND) and pupils at faith schools.",
      "Barristers for the government are expected to defend the policy on Wednesday by saying it would raise money and standards in the state sector.",
      "VAT on private school fees was introduced on 1 January across the UK.",
      "Lord Pannick, one of the country's leading barristers in cases relating to government decisions, said the families he is representing \"are not wealthy\".",
      "Two of the claimants have no alternative schools in their area to meet the needs of their children who have SEND, the court heard.",
      "Another family sent their child to a single sex independent primary school after they experienced \"harassment\" in their previous co-educational school.",
      "Lord Pannick argued that adding VAT to their fees impedes their right to access education and the policy is \"unprecedented\" in all other Council of Europe states.",
      "Around a quarter of families affected by the VAT changes fall below the average wealth level, and the policy has been brought in \"irrespective of the needs of the child\" or of the ability of the family to pay, he told the court.",
      "Lord Pannick is leading the challenge for the Independent Schools Council (ISC) which represents more than 1,400 private schools. There are two further claims also being heard by a group of faith schools and the parent-led group Education not Discrimination.",
      "They are seeking a declaration of incompatibility with Article 2 of the First Protocol of the European Convention on Human Rights, which is the right to education, and that the policy is also discriminatory.",
      "It is \"not good enough\" for the government to say \"it has been debated in Parliament\" and will \"raise revenue\", Lord Pannick argued, stating that the policy needed stricter scrutiny.",
      "Barristers representing Chancellor Rachel Reeves, along with HMRC and the Department for Education (DfE), are due to give their side of the case on Wednesday.",
      "In his written submission, Sir James Eadie KC, representing the government, said parents wishing to opt out of \"universally accessible state-funded education\" are free to choose \"any private education for their child that they can afford\", or they can \"educate their child at home\".",
      "Sir James will argue that taxes, minimum wage laws and national insurance, which all affect the cost of private school fees, do not interfere with \"with freedom to offer or receive private education.\"",
      "SEND pupils who have an education, health and care plan which names a private school have their fees paid for by their local council.",
      "Sophie Kemp from the law firm Kingsley Napley is representing the ISC families and told the BBC: \"It's particularly difficult for those who may have SEND and/or religious convictions where the state can't meet those needs.\"",
      "She added: \"For example children with very complex needs have had many failed placements, including in the state sector, and then that leaves them in a difficult position because their educational needs cannot necessarily be met by going to the state sector, and that's how the policy has a discriminatory impact on children with those types of needs.\"",
      "Speaking outside court, Caroline Santer, headteacher at the King's School in Hampshire, said she was hopeful the review would change things as they had a \"strong argument\".",
      "Ms Santer said the primary school, where fees start at \u00a37,258, charges less than it costs the government to put a child in state school \"saving the government a lot of money\".",
      "She added: \"Parents are already struggling with fairly reasonable fees \u2013 now 20% on top does seem an affront to human rights.\"",

      "A public petition to remove loopholes that allow wealthy foreign individuals to donate to UK political parties was signed by more than 142,000 people, sparking a debate by MPs.",

      "Leading the Westminster Hall debate, Labour MP Irene Campbell said: \"Elon Musk proposed to donate a large sum to Reform UK and while he could not make a personal donation there are ways he could possibly get around the rules.\"",
      "The debate heard from multiple MPs raising concerns around foreign interference in UK politics, with several raising fears about a potential donation from Mr Musk or alleged links between Farage and other foreign actors.",
      "Responding to the concerns, including possible interference by Russia, China and Iran, Ali told MPs she believed action must be taken to enhance safeguards against foreign donations, including those funnelled through UK companies.",

      "First Minister Eluned Morgan has criticised a UK cabinet minister and Welsh Labour colleague for saying she backed the chancellor's benefits cuts.",
      "Welsh Secretary Jo Stevens told BBC Wales last week that the first minister had \"welcomed\" the reforms.",
      "In a fiery session in the Senedd dominated by rows over changes to disability and sickness payments, Morgan said: \"I had somebody else last week trying to speak for me. I speak for myself.\"",
      "Sources close to the first minister confirmed to the BBC that the comment referred to Stevens. The UK government has said it is not commenting on the matter.",
      "In her strongest comments on the issue so far, Morgan said she lamented the reforms and that people were \"suffering\" and \"worried\".",
      "But the first minister repeatedly declined to condemn the cuts outright as she came under sustained criticism from the opposition in first minister's questions (FMQs).",
      "She had written to Work and Pensions Secretary Liz Kendall asking for an assessment of the cuts' impact on Wales on 11 March.",
      "On Tuesday the response was published by the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) - with no impact assessment included, although the DWP promised to look \"at specific impacts for those living in Wales\" in future.",
      "The response had been received over a fortnight since Morgan's initial request. The Welsh government had declined to publish the letter itself.",
      "The issue is set to return to the Senedd again on Wednesday, after a Plaid Cymru proposal for a debate was agreed to by Welsh Labour and backed unanimously by the Senedd.",
      "At a committee meeting on Friday Morgan refused to support the welfare cuts until she knew what the impact would be in Wales.",
      "She responded with silence when Stevens' claim that she supported the changes was put to her.",

      "People 'terrified' by benefit reforms - Labour politician",
      "Reeves criticised by Labour MP on benefits cuts",
      "Welsh Conservative Senedd leader Darren Millar accused Morgan of a lack of transparency for not releasing the letter.",
      "In her Spring Statement, Chancellor Rachel Reeves announced a number of benefit changes, including tightening qualification rules for Personal Independence Payments (Pips) - the main disability benefit - claimed by more than 250,000 working aged people in Wales.",
      "In the Senedd Plaid Cymru's Rhun ap Iorwerth reminded the first minister of Stevens' comments, as he accused her of being fearful of upsetting the UK government.",
      "In response Morgan said: \"I've got a lot of people trying to put words into my mouth these days, haven't I?",
      "\"You summarized my position? I had somebody else last week trying to speak for me. I speak for myself. I speak for the Welsh government.",
      "\"The UK government can speak up for itself, and they can defend their positions. I will defend the position of the Welsh Labour government here in Wales.\"",
      "'Contempt'",
      "Morgan came under pressure from a number of Plaid Cymru MSs, who called for her to condemn the reforms.",
      "\"What contempt Westminster shows us, leaving us in Wales to second-guess the effect that these benefit cuts will have because Westminster refuses to tell us,\" said Delyth Jewell, Plaid MS for South Wales East.",
      "Morgan replied that she was \"exercised about the proposal\".",
      "She said: \"When we talk about changes, we have to understand that people are suffering here, and that we need to stand with them and listen to them and ensure that we speak for them.",
      "\"All over Wales today there are tens of thousands of people who are really worried about the impact that proposed reforms could have, but they don't know to what extent it will happen, they don't know when it will happen.",
      "\"I am determined to make sure that Welsh voices are heard when it comes to welfare reform,\" she added, promising to present concerns \"plainly and unambiguously in the evidence that we will present in response to welfare reform\".",
      "While she argued there were some things in the plans that were positive, Morgan said: \"One of the things that I lament is the fact that really, ideally, it should have been about putting people and the benefits system and the need to reform it first and then to worry about how that is organised afterwards.\"",
      "In her letter to Eluned Morgan, Kendall said: \"As the people of Wales know all too well, many of these challenges are concentrated in places which were decimated in the 80s and 90s when whole industries closed. 15% of working age people in Wales receive a disability or incapacity benefit \u2013 significantly higher than in England \u2013 and around a quarter are neither in work nor looking for work.\"",
      "She said the UK government was working with Welsh ministers on the design of \"a Get Britain Working Trailblazer\" to look at how work, health and skills support could be \"best joined up\".",
      "No impact assessment was included. However, a DWP spokesperson said it \"will work with the Welsh government and other devolved administrations to ensure their views are at the heart of what we do.",
      "\"This includes looking at specific impacts for those living in Wales to help support people back into work if they are able, while also protecting those who rely on our social security system.\"",
      "'Wave of new taxes'",
      "The Welsh Conservatives' Darren Millar said in a statement: \"The first minister promised accountability, but is delivering evasive answers and a complete lack of transparency.",
      "\"On a multitude of issues, Labour is hiding from scrutiny instead of giving the people of Wales the answers they deserve. On top of this, they're failing to stand up for Wales against Keir Starmer's wave of new taxes, hitting Welsh farmers and businesses.\"",
      "Rhun ap Iorwerth said in the Senedd: \"The first minister made opportunity for every family one of her top priorities. Now, the words are good, but on the deeds, she's falling well, well short.\"",
      "Analysis",
      "By Gareth Lewis, BBC Wales political editor",
      "Welfare reform is getting messier for Labour.",
      "After some of the party's MPs and MSs spoke out against the plans, we now have the FM more explicitly taking issue with her Labour colleague at Westminster Jo Stevens.",
      "Morgan's response last week to the claim that she welcomed the reforms was a silent, stony stare.",
      "Some Labour MSs have been looking for the FM to assert herself on welfare, a tricky balance when the plans are being introduced by your own party.",
      "Although she declined another opportunity to condemn the cuts, the language \u2013 \"exercised\", \"lament\" \u2013 is carefully chosen to go about as far as she feels comfortable without actually condemning them.",
      "The problem for Morgan is that she is caught in a bind and risks pleasing no one.",
      "One of her own MSs has already warned that his constituents are \"terrified\". Opposition parties are on the attack.",
      "The Conservatives argue she is not being transparent enough about her dealings with the UK government; Plaid Cymru and the Lib Dems that she is not fighting hard enough to stand up for Wales."

      "by Dharshini David, deputy economics editor",
      "The impact of a US tariff on all British goods is very uncertain. It depends on not just on the scale of any tariffs applied on British products, but how the government, businesses and consumers react.",
      "As the car industry knows already, tariffs are extremely worrying for the industries affected - as an exporter you hope that either some of it can be soaked up in the supply chain or your American customers will be happy to pay higher prices - or you take a hit to your own profits by lowering prices.",
      "Or you may lose sales, tariffs are undeniably bad news for exporters in the firing line.",
      "But their impact on prices in the UK is uncertain. If the UK government retaliates with tariffs on American products, households here could face rises. But countries such as China, if disadvantaged by American tariffs, could try to send their goods here instead, pushing down prices.",
      "Broadly, US tariffs would be detrimental to UK growth. Without retaliatory tariffs, the UK's official forecasters reckon that 0.6% could be knocked off UK growth next year - unhelpful but not disastrous. Underpinning that scenario is a number of assumptions.",
      "But, as it cautions, there are so many uncertainties about not just the policy, but how it would filter through."

    "story": [
      "Sir Keir Starmer's communications chief has resigned after nine months in Downing Street.",
      "Labour veteran Matthew Doyle, who worked for Tony Blair, was brought in as Sir Keir's communications director four years ago, when the party was in opposition.",
      "He is the second senior member of Sir Keir's team to leave less than a year after the general election, following Sue Gray walking out of the door as his chief of staff in the autumn.",
      "Mr Doyle's departure is expected to lead to the promotions of James Lyons to director of communications (strategy) and Steph Driver to director of communications (delivery).",
      "Sue Gray quits as Sir Keir Starmer's chief of staff",
      "Dodds exit shows unease over Starmer's tough decisions",
      "Mr Doyle's decision to quit and leave immediately has caused some surprise, but one special adviser said he \"had been increasingly detached for some time. It was clear that Lyons was actually in charge - and doing an excellent job to be fair\".",
      "The veteran spin doctor has more than a quarter of a century of experience with Labour, beginning as the head of press for the party in 1998, before a brief stint as an adviser to David Blunkett, then the work and pensions secretary.",
      "Moving into Blair's No 10 in 2005, Mr Doyle rose to become deputy head of communications, and carried on working for Blair after he left office for another five years.",
      "He spent a period working at the charity International Rescue with David Miliband, the former Blair-era foreign secretary, and set up his own consultancy.",
      "Mr Doyle joined Sir Keir Starmer's team in the summer of 2021, arguably the lowest point of his leadership, shortly after a humiliating defeat for Labour in a by-election in Hartlepool.",
      "An email from Mr Doyle to colleagues this morning, seen by the BBC, said \"it's time to pass the baton on\".",
      "He added: \"I wanted to let you know that I have informed the prime minister I am standing down as director of communications.",
      "\"When I started working for Keir four years ago, not many people thought we could win a general election and certainly not in the emphatic way we did.",
      "\"That was down to the hard work and determination of so many people and of course Keir's leadership.",
      "\"I am incredibly proud of the part I have played in returning our party to government and the change we are already bringing to the country. Now it's time to pass the baton on.\"",
      "'Away day'",
      "In a statement, Sir Keir said: \"Matthew brought his considerable experience to my team in summer 2021 and has worked tirelessly by my side every day since playing a leading role in Labour's historic election win.",
      "\"On a personal level it has been a real privilege to work with him and on behalf of the entire team I wish him all the very best for his next role.\"",

    "published": "Fri, 28 Mar 2025 00:00:13 GMT",
    "summary": "Why the reign of the free market is facing its biggest ever challenge",
    "story": [
      "I remember 1974 well. With inflation on the rise, the government had been locked in battle with trade unions over worker pay. The government appeared paralysed: stand up to the miners and strikes could shut down the power system, but give in and pay them more money and inflation would rocket.",
      "And then the global oil crisis came out of nowhere. It threw economies, including Britain's, into chaos. The government introduced a three-day week. Power cuts were common - we would be plunged into darkness without warning. And seemingly, the government just expected us to deal with it.",
      "This was also the year I began presenting the BBC's current affairs programme Panorama. We spent a lot of time debating these issues. People came on with all kinds of different ideas of what to do.",
      "There were even suggestions that what the country really needed to take back control from the unions was a military takeover - a coup.",
      "There was another idea out there too. It was proposed by the Conservative politician Keith Joseph and was entirely radical - so removed from the mainstream, in fact, that during filming of Panorama, Joseph turned to the production team and asked exasperatedly if they understood what he meant.",
      "That idea was the free market.",
      "This meant Britain departing from the post World War Two consensus that government should control the economy and that instead if you left the markets alone, they would deliver the country greater prosperity and security.",
      "If, in 2025, the idea sounds anything but radical, that's exactly the point.",
      "What we saw in the UK in the 1980s under Margaret Thatcher's government was just how quickly the free market transitioned from a radical idea into the new reality. Then before long it became what many assumed was the system that would last forever.",
      "US President Donald Trump is a billionaire businessman who has clearly done well financially out of capitalism. But suddenly, thanks in part to him, the free market system finds itself under assault like never before.",
      "It might yet weather the storm. However others are asking, is the free market system fatally flawed and doomed to failure?",
      "The fantasy world of Thatcher's Britain",
      "So much of what Thatcher did in the wake of her 1983 general election victory seems so obvious now. We take it for granted that private companies play a pivotal role in providing our water, electricity, gas, railways, ports and freight.",
      "But at the time few believed it possible to do what she had done - it seemed like a fantasy world, completely detached from how things had been done post war.",
      "I was six when the war ended. There was rationing \u2013 coupons that allowed you to buy meat or clothes, or of course, sweets. But out of these hard times and on the heels of victory, a new vision of society was emerging in Britain.",
      "With Clement Attlee's landslide election victory in July 1945, for the first time in Britain's political history a majority cast their votes for a party ostensibly dedicated to socialism.",
      "But more than that, a new consensus on how the country should run emerged, with those leading the Labour and Conservative parties singing from a broadly similar sheet.",
      "\"We have built our defences against want and sickness, and we're proud of it,\" was uttered not by a Labour prime minister but by Harold Macmillan, Conservative prime minister from 1957 to 1963. This had been how things were done.",
      "However not everyone bought into the consensus. Antony Fisher, who was a chicken farmer, was exasperated by what he saw as the meddling of the Egg Marketing Board. He set up the Institute of Economic Affairs think tank, inspired Keith Joseph and he in turn got Thatcher's ear.",
      "Trump's admiration of Thatcher",
      "That the current assault on the free market is coming, in part, from a Republican US president seems all the more ironic given how popular Thatcher's reforms were with the American right.",
      "Thatcher and President Ronald Reagan shared a similar world view, and Trump has spoken of his admiration for the two, albeit with the caveat that he didn't agree with some of Reagan's trade policies.",
      "Thatcher was convinced that the country would be much better off if gas and water and electricity were taken out of the hands of the state. And sold on the open market. The free market. Just like buying a loaf of bread.",
      "The Thatcher government's big idea was that they weren't just going to sell the shares in state-owned utilities to big businesses or investors. They were going to offer them to the British people.",
      "In December 1984 shares in British Telecom (BT) went on sale. The next morning, the numbers were staggering: more than two million Britons were now BT shareholders.",
      "And Thatcher began to realise that selling off these companies wasn't just about breaking the shackles of government control. It could be something bigger - turning every person in Britain into a capitalist and in doing so making capitalism popular.",
      "In Britain, by the end of the 1980s, the scale of transformation was staggering. The sum of \u00a360bn was raised by selling off state run companies. Up to 15 million Britons were now shareholders.",
      "Britain was embracing the free market. This wasn't just an economic shift. It was a cultural revolution. A redefinition of Britain's relationship with money, with government, and with itself.",
      "And if Thatcher's privatisation had given ordinary people the chance to buy shares, her reforms to Britain's financial services sector in 1986, known as the Big Bang, gave ordinary people the chance to sell them too, to get a job in the previously closed world of the City.",
      "There were many on the left for whom the principle alone of these reforms was something to object to. The assault on the free market from some on the right is not about the principles of the reforms, but the consequences.",
      "Offshore business and collapsing communities",
      "At the core of Thatcher's thinking was a belief that free market capitalism could work only if many people had a direct stake in it. And with share ownership of previously state run utilities, many people did. But before long, alarm bells were starting to be rung. And their chime has only gotten louder.",
      "James Goldsmith was a businessman who had made a fortune by buying struggling companies cheaply, reshaping them to maximise efficiency and then selling them at a profit. The 1980s reforms were like manna from heaven for him.",
      "But then he seemed to change his mind about things. In 1994 he told a committee of US senators that its premise contained a fatal flaw - that the system demanded maximum profit but to achieve maximum profit that meant severing the umbilical link with many of your own electorate.",
      "\"You get to a system whereby, to get the best corporate profits, you have to leave your own country. You have to say to your own sales force 'Goodbye, we can't use you anymore - you're too expensive'.",
      "\"You've got unions. You want holidays. You want protection. So we're going offshore.\"",
      "Goldsmith was predicting that companies would take their business wherever they would make the most money. If you are a CEO answerable to shareholders that's literally your job description. And the result, he said, would be job losses in the West, with communities collapsing.",
      "And to make things worse, he argued that Britain had ceded sovereignty to the likes of the European Union and the World Trade Organization, with Britain binding itself to an economic system run by unelected bureaucrats in Brussels, only adding to the sense of alienation felt in collapsing communities. And with global markets dictating policy. If an industry wasn't profitable, it was left to die.",
      "Today, the UK may be a global leader in science and financial services but is that of much consolation to communities where we once made things that are now made offshore?",
      "Based on what I often heard in my many years touring the country presenting Question Time, I'm not sure it is.",
      "Goldsmith would end up trying to go into politics. His Referendum Party was trounced in the 1997 general election but he had planted a seed. He had argued that the global free market path that Britain and the rest of the world was going down was dangerous. That it would spread division around the world.",
      "Fast-forward nearly 20 years to 2016 and his warning came to pass. Britain voted to leave the European Union and the verdict could not be clearer: the Leave vote was highest in those left-behind communities, seemingly fuelled by those who felt globalisation was not working for them.",
      "The dream of a nation of shareholders has soured too.",
      "In 1989 Thames Water was privatised. We were promised lower bills, better infrastructure, less red tape and investment in a system fraying at the edges. It was investment that the global capitalist system was supposedly best placed to provide.",
      "What followed was something else entirely. Debt ballooned and dividends flowed to shareholders. The company extracted profit while pipes leaked and sewage poured into rivers. And our bills now pay for interest on that debt - it feels like we've come a long way from Thatcher's nation of shareholders.",
      "Trump's tariffs 'defy easy explanation'",
      "Back in 1994, James Goldsmith had posited that the problem with the free market dream was that it didn't protect the home base.",
      "Now, there is someone else much more powerful who takes that view.",
      "President Trump's methods are so erratic that with him it's hard to tell what is going on. His readiness to slap hugely consequential tariffs on countries that are both traditional foes and supposed friends at times defies easy explanation.",
      "But what we can say is that he is trying to return to ideas that preceded the free market. He is trying to make America strong through protectionism, making it harder for anyone to simply sell anywhere.",
      "There is an argument that if you take the long view then perhaps the free market period is the outlier. Britain itself had a long, long period of protectionism before it embraced free trade.",
      "Tariffs are nothing new in world economic history and in a sense Trump is just trying to return the US to how things were, albeit in quite a chaotic way.",
      "The reign of the free market is facing its biggest ever challenge. But that challenge is coming not from supporters of socialism who ideologically back a big role for the state. Instead, the challenge is coming from Trump, a man who is broadly speaking of the right and has no qualms with capitalism allowing people to become very rich.",
      "That the challenge is coming from within is what makes it so potent.",

      "The analysis, which the BBC had exclusive access to, used United Utilities operational data to establish when the company was discharging sewage into Windermere when it should by law have been treating some of it.",
      "The campaigners from Windrush Against Sewage Pollution (WASP) and Save Windermere identified 140 illegal spill days in 2024, more than in any of the three previous years.",
      "United Utilities told BBC News that the campaigners' findings were \"inaccurate\" and some of the data \"erroneous\".",
      "The company declined to put in writing, despite repeated requests, any specific examples of mistakes or omissions.",
      "Regulators Ofwat and the Environment Agency are both currently investigating United Utilities operations.",
      "Sewage dumped illegally in Windermere over 3 years",
      "Government vows to clean up England's largest lake",
      "Water firm behind spills says fixes will take time",
      "Part of the Lake District National Park Unesco World Heritage Site, Windermere is home to more than 14,000 people and its scenery attracts an estimated seven million visitors per year.",
      "But its pristine image is under threat. Regular discharges of sewage into Windermere have been blamed for increasing nutrient levels and turning parts of the lake green \u2013 so called \"algal blooming.\"",
      "The BBC has regularly reported on discharges into Windermere. Last October it was revealed that a single pumping station had illegally spilled more than 140 million litres of raw sewage between 2020 and 2023. In 2023 BBC Panorama said United Utilities was misreporting pollution incidents.",
      "Earlier in March environment secretary Steve Reed called the amount of pollution entering the lake \"a disgrace\" and pledged to clean it up.",
      "Last week the Environment Agency said United Utilities had spilled 77,817 times in 2024, the highest figure of all England's water companies.",
      "Many of the spills will have been legal. All water companies are legally allowed to discharge raw sewage to stop the network getting overwhelmed and this now happens regularly during periods of heavy rain.",
      "But almost all pumping stations and treatment plants operate under an environmental permit which specify that they must process or \"pass forward\" a certain amount of sewage and rainwater before spilling starts.",
      "The campaigners cross-referenced United Utilities datasets showing when an asset was spilling against how much sewage it was treating at the time. The campaigners' analysis \u2013 which has been shared with and scrutinised by the BBC -  found days when illegal spills appear to have occurred at each of six sewage facilities around the lake, which combined to 140 days in 2024. That's more than in any of the previous three years, as the chart below shows.",
      "The longest illegal spill the analysis identified was for 10 days from Hawkshead pumping station, which flows into Windermere via Cunsey Beck.",
      "\"This is an indication that their works have not been maintained properly or they're not being watched over properly,\" says Prof Peter Hammond, a mathematican and retired academic from campaign group Windrush Against Sewage Pollution.",
      "Prof Hammond's analysis of water company data has been cited by regulators and he has been praised in Parliament by water company executives for bringing problems to light they were previously unaware of.",
      "The latest analysis covers four years of data from six sites that discharge sewage into the Lake Windermere catchment.",
      "Comparisons over a longer time period are impossible as United Utilities has only had made full data sets available since 2021.",
      "The regulators Ofwat and the Environment Agency have since 2021 been investigating whether the water companies have been treating enough sewage before they start to spill. The EA call it a \"major criminal investigation\" while Ofwat call it \"the largest and most complex Ofwat has ever undertaken\".",
      "Last week Yorkshire Water agreed to a \u00a340m \"enforcement action\" after Ofwat uncovered \"serious failures\" in how it operated its treatment plant and network.",
      "Ofwat declined to comment on the campaigner's findings as their investigation into United Utilities is ongoing.",
      "In response to concerns about United Utilities the Environment Agency last year reviewed all of its environmental permits in the Windermere catchment and says this led directly to the water company tripling its investment plans for the area to \u00a3200m.",
      "\"We are currently carrying out investigations into suspected pollution incidents on the Windermere catchment and are unable to comment on these in detail until they have reached a conclusion,\" an EA spokesperson said when the campaigners' analysis was shared with them.",
      "\"Where we find breaches of environmental permits, we will take the appropriate enforcement action up to and including a criminal prosecution.\"",
      "United Utilities, which provides services to more than seven million people across north-west England, is more than \u00a39bn in debt. Its chief executive Louise Beardmore confirmed to parliament in February that she was last year paid \u00a31.4m including a bonus of \u00a3420,000.",
      "\"The methodology used by the campaigners is different to that used by the Environment Agency for its compliance assessments,\" the water company said in a statement.",
      "\"On top of that, erroneous data has been used, tags and naming conventions in data sets appear to have been misunderstood, and assumptions seem to have been made on whether different types of flow meters have been installed.\"",
      "\"The methodology fails to use other corroborating information from the sites which would prove that spills did not occur. As a result, the numbers quoted are inaccurate.\"",
      "BBC News presented United Utilities with five examples of illegal spills the campaigners' analysis had identified using the company's data and asked for any evidence or explanation as to why they were not illegal. United Utilities repeatedly declined to do so in writing or on camera.",
      "\"What we're seeing is the failure of privatisation. We're seeing a prioritisation of dividend returns over the long-term environmental protection of places like Windermere\" says Matt Staniek from Save Windermere.",

      "Meet agreed annual improvement levels in these sectors and, for each, Gothenburg gets a discount on the yearly fee it pays for the loan of 0.1% or around 100,000 kronor ($10,500; \u00a38,000). But miss one of the targets by a certain amount and it has to pay a fine of the same amount.",
      "In 2022 and 2023 Gothenburg managed to avoid a financial penalty, but the newly released figures for 2024 show that it missed its target for switching to renewable energy. And so it is about to be fined 150,000 kroner.",
      "However, this is offset by the discounts it is getting for continuing to hit improvement levels for energy usage and social improvement. For electrifying the council's vehicles, while it missed its improvement goal, it didn't do so by enough to be fined.",
      "Fredrik Block, portfolio manager at the City of Gothenburg, says that the local authority deliberately set \"ambitious\" targets.",
      "\"You aim high, and you get the whole organisation to strive towards that target. We are not proceeding as fast as we expected, but we are taking one step at a time. The goal is still to be close to carbon-free by 2030.",
      "\"We're actually not doing it for the money. We're doing it to show the city's important work and that we are making progress every year. We want to show to the world how it is - that these are the problems, and these are the good things.\"",
      "The improvements to the city's poorest areas \u2013 and whether the council has hit its targets - are measured by yearly resident surveys. People are asked about their feelings towards an area's safety and cleanliness.",
      "Key initiatives have included making housing more secure, introducing more surveillance cameras and increasing police presence as a crime prevention measure in areas of the city like Hjallbo and Biskopsgarden. Located in the north of the city, they have high levels of crime and unemployment, and large immigrant populations.",
      "Public housing agency Framtiden, which is ultimately owned by the City of Gothenburg, says it takes the improvement work very seriously.",
      "\"For some of these vulnerable areas, we actually own the majority of the housing,\" says its research and development manager, Lars Bankvall.",
      "\"We are more or less the only official body in these areas. There's no one else there, only us.",
      "\"I see us as maybe the most powerful tool that the city has, because we have a lot of financial resources. We are involved in everything.\"",
      "But Faduma Awil, a social worker who now provides career coaching at an employment centre in Gothenburg, is concerned that increased cameras and police presence sends the wrong message to youth in Gothenburg's deprived areas - and could see racial profiling increase.",
      "\"What will our children think when they see cameras everywhere in Hjallbo, but none in a Swedish neighbourhood? How will they feel when they are constantly being watched by police?\" she says.",
      "\"What will you tell them? You are showing them there is a difference between them and native Swedes.\"",
      "Ms Awil is also not convinced the resident surveys are effective or accurate. And she feels the city is placing a disproportionate amount of effort into its environmental goals, at the expense of improving conditions in underprivileged areas.",
      "\"People in these areas don't care about the environment. They need to go to school. They need to work. They need to eat,\" says Ms Awil, who migrated from Somalia to Sweden in 1987 as a child.",
      "Negotiating an SLL is a rigorous, complex process - one that took the City of Gothenburg a year to do, with no fewer than six major Nordic banks involved.",
      "Such is the difficulty of acquiring an SLL that the number issued globally fell by 56% in 2023, according to data from financial news provider Bloomberg.",
      "Mats Olausson is senior sustainability advisor at Swedish bank SEB, which is the lead lender of Gothenburg's SLL.",
      "He says SEB has turned down potential SLL borrowers as the client's proposed targets weren't ambitious enough. Yet he adds that SLLs are challenging for companies or local authorities that successfully get one.",
      "\"It's sad if a company puts a lot of resources into designing an SLL, and then it turns out that the only publicity they get is negative,\" he says. \"You run the risk of being pulled into the dirt for having not done a good enough job.",
      "\"It's in no one's interest to have targets that are overly ambitious and basically impossible to achieve, or for companies who don't have the right governance in place to implement the actions that will be the building blocks of the actual strategy.\"",
      "One company that is happy with its SLL is Danish management consultancy Emagine. It borrowed \u00a310m in 2021, funds that helped it to acquire six other firms around the world.",
      "Its binding goals include increasing the number of female leaders in the organisation by 16%, and reducing overall employee turnover by 6% over the seven-year long period. It is doing this through leadership and mentoring programs.",
      "By meeting the targets, Emagine is benefiting from reduced interest rates, says Lars Bloch, the company's chief financial officer.",
      "\"If we didn't meet the goals, we would be landed with interest penalty rates. We also accept that failing to meet sustainability targets could harm the firm's reputation, as we have made a public commitment.",
      "\"It shouldn't be about committing to the loan to get a discount on financing - there needs to be ambition behind the goals.\"",
      "Back in Gothenburg, the city's current environmental and social targets run until 2030. Mr Block says that the detailed yearly SLL reporting shows to potential future investors in the city what a difference their money would make.",
      "\"Banks want to give money to sustainable cities, so packaging up our progress in our SLL reporting is how I make the city beautiful for investors,\" he says.",
      "\"I can't change the credit worthiness of the city, but I can change how investors look at our sustainability work, and make it more attractive to them.\"",

    "story": [
      "The climate action group Just Stop Oil has announced it is to disband at the end of April. Its activists have been derided as attention-seeking zealots and vandals and it is loathed by many for its disruptive direct action tactics. It says it has won because its demand that there should be no new oil and gas licences is now government policy.  So, did they really win and does this mark an end to the chaos caused by its climate protests?",
      "Hayley Walsh's heart was racing as she sat in the audience at the Theatre Royal Drury Lane on 27 January this year.",
      "The 42 year-old lecturer and mother of three tried to calm her breathing. Hollywood star Sigourney Weaver was onstage in her West End debut production of Shakespeare's The Tempest.",
      "But Hayley, a Just Stop Oil activist, had her own drama planned.",
      "As Weaver's Prospero declaimed \"Come forth, I say,\" Hayley sprang from her seat and rushed the stage with Richard Weir, a 60-year-old mechanical engineer from Tyneside.",
      "They launched a confetti cannon and unfurled a banner that read \"Over 1.5 Degrees is a Global Shipwreck\" - a reference to the news that 2024 was the first year to pass the symbolic 1.5C threshold in global average temperature rise, and a nod to the shipwreck theme in the play.",
      "It was a classic Just Stop Oil (JSO) action. The target was high profile and would guarantee publicity. The message was simple and presented in the group's signature fluorescent orange.",
      "The reaction of those affected was also a classic response to JSO.  Amid the boos and whistles you can hear a shout of \"idiots\".",
      "\"Drag them off the stage\", one audience member can be heard shouting, \"I hope you [expletive] get arrested,\" another says.",
      "JSO is a UK-based environmental activist group that aims to end fossil fuel extraction and uses direct action to draw attention to its cause. It has been called a \"criminal cult\" and its activists branded \"eco-loons\" by the Sun. The Daily Mail has described it as \"deranged\" and says its members have \"unleashed misery on thousands of ordinary people though their selfish antics\".",
      "The group has thrown soup at a Van Gogh in the National Gallery, exploded a chalk dust bomb during the World Snooker Championship in Sheffield, smashed a cabinet containing a copy of the Magna Carta at the British Library, sprayed temporary paint on the stones of Stonehenge and even defaced Charles Darwin's grave.",
      "But it is the group's road protests that have probably caused the most disruption \u2013 and public anger. In November 2022, 45 JSO members climbed gantries around the M25 severely disrupting traffic for over four days. People missed flights, medical appointments and exams as thousands of drivers were delayed for hours. The cost to the Metropolitan Police was put at \u00a31.1 million.",
      "Just Stop Oil was born out of Extinction Rebellion (XR).  XR \u2013 founded in 2018 - brought thousands of people onto the streets in what were dubbed \"festivals of resistance\".  They came to a peak in April 2019, when protestors brought parts of the capital to a halt for more than a week and plonked a large pink boat in the middle of Oxford Circus.",
      "The spectacle and disruption XR caused generated massive media attention, but the police were furious.  Hundreds of officers were diverted from frontline duties and by the end of 2019 the bill for policing the protests had reached \u00a337m.",
      "And behind the scenes XR was riven by furious debates about tactics.  Many inside the movement said it should be less confrontational and disruptive but a hard core of activists argued it would be more effective to double down on direct action.",
      "It became clear that there was room for what Sarah Lunnon, one of the co-founders of Just Stop Oil, calls \"a more radical flank\".  They decided a new, more focused operation was needed, modelled on earlier civil disobedience movements like the Suffragettes, Gandhi's civil disobedience campaigns and the civil rights movement in the US.",
      "The group was formally launched on Valentine's Day, 2022. It was a very different animal to XR. Instead of thousands of people taking part in street carnivals, JSO's actions involved a few committed activists. A small strategy group oversaw the campaign and meticulously planned its activities. A mobilisation team worked to recruit new members, and another team focused on supporting activists after they were arrested.",
      "The dozens of actions the group has carried out generated lots of publicity, but also massive public opposition. There were confrontations between members of the public and protestors and an outcry from politicians across all the main political parties.",
      "The police said they needed more powers to deal with this new form of protest and they got them. New offences were created including interfering with national infrastructure, \"locking on\" \u2013 chaining or gluing yourself to something \u2013 and tunnelling underground. Causing a public nuisance also became a potential crime \u2013 providing the police with a powerful new tool to use against protestors who block roads.",
      "In the four years since it was formed dozens of the group's supporters have been jailed. Five activists were handed multi-year sentences for their role in the M25 actions in 2022. Those were reduced on appeal earlier this month but are still the longest jail terms for non-violent civil disobedience ever issued.",
      "Senior JSO members deny the crackdown had anything to do with the group's decision to \"hang up the hi-vis\" \u2013 as its statement this week announcing the end of campaign put it.",
      "JSO's public position is that it has won its battle. \"Just Stop Oil's initial demand to end new oil and gas is now government policy, making us one of the most successful civil resistance campaigns in recent history,\" the group claimed.",
      "The government has said it does not plan to issue any new licences for oil and gas production but strongly denies its policies have a link to JSO. Furthermore, the Prime Minister's official spokesperson told journalists: \"We have been very clear when it comes to oil and gas that it has a future for decades to come in our energy mix.\"",
      "And the group's wider goal \u2013 to end the production of oil and gas \u2013 has manifestly not been achieved. The members of the group I spoke to for this article all agree the climate crisis has deepened.",
      "In the face of stiffer sentences, some climate campaigners have said they will turn to more clandestine activities. One new group says it plans a campaign of sabotage against key infrastructure. In a manifesto published online it says it plans to \"kickstart a new phase of the climate activist movement, aiming to shut down key actors of the fossil fuel economy.\"",
      "That's not a direction the JSO members I spoke to said they wanted to go. Sarah Lunnon said a key principle of JSO and the civil disobedience movement generally was that activists would take responsibility for their actions. One of the first questions new joiners were asked is whether they would be willing to be locked up.",
      "\"As corporations and billionaires corrupt political systems across the world, we need a different approach.",
      "\"We are creating a new strategy, to face this reality and to carry our responsibilities at this time,\" the group says, suggesting they may be planning to form a new movement.",
      "JSO's most high-profile figure, Roger Hallam, is one of the five activists convicted for their role in the M25 protests. In a message from his prison cell he acknowledged that JSO has only had a \"marginal impact\".",
      "That is \"not due to lack of trying,\" he said. The failure lay with the UK's \"elites and our leaders\" who had walked away from their responsibility to tackle the climate crisis, Hallam claimed. A hint perhaps that the group's new focus might be on the political system itself.",
      "JSO has said its last protest \u2013 to be held at the end of April \u2013 will mark \"the end of soup on Van Goghs, cornstarch on Stonehenge and slow marching in the streets\". But don't believe it. When pressed, the JSO members I spoke to said they may well turn back to disruptive tactics but under a new name and with a new and as yet unspecified objective.",

    "summary": "Sewage spilled into England's waterways for a record number of hours last year, the Environmental Agency says.",
    "story": [
      "Water companies released raw sewage into England's rivers and seas for a record 3.61 million hours last year, a slight increase on 2023.",
      "The data released by Environment Agency on Thursday showed that although the number of spills was down each spill lasted longer on average - resulting in a higher total number of hours.",
      "Some spilling can be legal, but concern has been mounting amongst scientists about the harm that regular sewage spilling is causing the country's aquatic life.",
      "Water UK, the industry body, said sewage spills are a \"disgrace\" but has committed to a programme of investment worth \u00a3104bn over the next five years.",
      "How much sewage is spilled near you?",
      "Water company makes case for higher bill increases",
      "\"These figures are disgraceful and are a stark reminder of how years of underinvestment have led to water companies discharging unacceptable levels of sewage into our rivers, lakes, and seas,\" said Environment Secretary Steve Reed.",
      "His views were echoed by Water UK Chief Executive David Henderson: \"Any sewage flowing into waterways is a disgrace. Unfortunately, it's a system fault that we have in our network which mixes rainwater and wastewater. Nobody wants to see any spill of sewage in our waterways.\"",
      "England, like much of the world, has a combined sewage system meaning that rainwater and sewage share the same pipes. In some instances, when there is too much rain, treatment works can be overwhelmed, and sewage is spilled via overflow points into the country's rivers, lakes and seas to prevent a back up to the system.",
      "This practice is legal. But previous investigations by the BBC and Environment Agency have revealed that sewage has also been spilled by water companies under dry conditions in breach of their permits.",
      "Water companies collectively oversee more than 15,000 of these overflow sites and this was the first year where all sites were monitored, revealing for the first time the extent of spilling.",
      "Sewage was spilt for 3.614 million hours in 2024 compared to 3.606 million hours in 2023.",
      "CEO of River Action, James Wallace, said: \"A year on from last year's catastrophic pollution figures, the true scale of the UK's water crisis is only now coming to light. The figures have barely budged, testament to the deepening sewage scandal.\"",
      "In 2022, Prof Chris Whitty, chief medical office for the UK, outlined the serious health risks sewage spills can pose for those using the country's waterways. Chief amongst them is bacteria from human faeces which he said can \"increase the risk of significant infections including antibiotic resistant bacteria\".",
      "Sewage also poses significant environmental risks \u2013 it increases nutrients in the water leading to algal blooms which then eventually denies other wildlife \u2013 like fish - oxygen. These spills also have been shown to introduce microplastics, drugs and sanitary products into rivers and seas.",
      "The River Ver in St Albans is one such location - the banks are littered with condoms, tampon applicators and wet wipes likely from sewage releases from nearby Markyate sewage treatment works owned by Thames Water. This rare chalk stream \u2013 one of around 200 worldwide \u2013 which supports important wildlife like water voles, saw more than 3,300 hours of spills in 2024.",
      "Of the spills a Thames Water spokesperson said: \"The Markyate area experienced one of the wettest years on record in 2024 which has caused excessive amounts of groundwater which has infiltrated into the network. This has resulted in the system being overwhelmed which has led to discharges into the river.\"",
      "Liberal Democrats Leader Ed Davey said the scale of spilling showed that the sector regulator, Ofwat, was not up to the task.",
      "\"This has to be the final nail in the coffin for Ofwat, a regulator that has time and again proven it is completely inadequate to protect customers and our beautiful environment,\" he said.",
      "In October, the government launched an Independent Water Commission, chaired by former deputy Bank of England governor Sir Jon Cunliffe, to look into the sector - including the effectiveness of Ofwat.",
      "An Ofwat spokesperson said: \"Where companies miss their targets, they will be penalised and money will be returned to customers. In parallel, companies will be held to account for past failures through our ongoing enforcement work into the operation and maintenance of sewage works and networks.\"",
      "The Markyate site is one of a number across the country that is due an upgrade as part of a five-year \u00a3104bn investment programme by water companies \u2013 with \u00a324bn going specifically to improving infrastructure.",
      "These upgrades will be paid largely through bill rises \u2013 which are due to take effect from 1 April \u2013 and will see the average annual bill hit \u00a3603. This has angered consumer groups and environmental charities who argue that the burden of upgrades should be carried by shareholders not households.",
      "Prof Ewan McGaughey, Professor of Law at Kings College London, said: \"The water companies have paid over \u00a385bn out to shareholders since privatisation and that means they haven't been able to put the money into infrastructure.\"",
      "Ofwat and the industry have previously denied the figure\u2013 which comes from University of Greenwich research \u2013 is as high, but there is agreement that significant investment is required.",
      "Phillip Clisham, specialist adviser to the Institution of Civil Engineers on water and sanitation, has worked in the industry for more than three decades, and said the challenge of fixing the issue has been \"underestimated\".",
      "He said the two main solutions are building bigger storm tanks \u2013 which produce a huge amount of planet warming emissions in their construction \u2013 or to reduce excess rainwater by increasing green areas and the use of sustainable urban drainage systems.",

      "\"Everything the canal supports is at threat - we risk losing the jewel in the crown of south Wales,\" said Tracey Leake-Jones, who runs the Bridge 46 to Five Locks canal group.",
      "Made up of volunteers, the group runs events along the canal and has fundraised to install planters, benches and signs.",
      "The prospect of it having to close due to water shortages was \"utterly devastating\", she said.",
      "\"There has to be a solution found, and my view is that the Welsh government and its leaders are the only people who can bring all the main players together.\"",
      "She pointed to new housing estates being built along the canal with the waterway used as a marketing tool, and said the local council hoped to be able to open up further stretches down to Cwmbran, describing the economic benefits as \"unimaginable\".",
      "\"Should we have problems with water supply then what's going to happen to those plans for restoration that we've all been working on for the past three years?\"",
      "News broke of the difficulties facing the canal in a letter sent to local businesses by Gland\u0175r Cymru, the Canal and River Trust in Wales, in February.",
      "It explained the canal, which once transported iron and coal to Newport docks, had relied on funnelling water from the River Usk and its tributaries which accounted for 80-90% of its water supply.",
      "Recent changes in legislation, designed in part to protect rivers in the face of climate change, means licences are now required, restricting the amount of water that can be taken.",
      "Last year, Gland\u0175r Cymru lost an appeal against some of the conditions stipulated by environmental regulator Natural Resources Wales (NRW).",
      "The River Usk is a designated special area of conservation protected by law due to its importance for rare wildlife including the Atlantic salmon, which is threatened with extinction from Wales.",
      "\"The canal took around 30% of the total flow of the river in 2022 - which was the last dry year period,\" said Gail Davies-Walsh, chief executive of Afonydd Cymru which represents river groups across Wales.",
      "Limits on abstraction were needed to ensure the species and habitats had sufficient water to survive \"particularly during dry summers and low flow periods,\" she said.",
      "Mark Evans, director of Gland\u0175r Cymru, said the trust accepted it could no longer continue to abstract water from the Usk at the same level as it had in the past.",
      "But recent dry weather highlighted the urgency of finding an alternative supply, he said.",
      "\"The amount of water we can take is starting to really concern us,\" he explained.",
      "\"It's urgent today, looking at the forecast for the next week.",
      "\"At some point we'll have to stop the boats from using the locks,\" he warned, adding that both the canal's users and its wildlife would be impacted as levels fell.",
      "Discussions have been taking place in recent weeks with Welsh Water over whether it could help to support the canal during periods of prolonged dry weather.",
      "But this would come with \"financial implications\" and the potential of having to pay commercial rates for the water, resulting in a considerable bill the charity could not afford, he claimed.",
      "Alasdair Kirkpatrick, owner of Beacon Park Boats, said he had already received phone calls from customers who had booked boat trips asking about the impact on them.",
      "\"I never saw this one coming,\" he said, \"it has really shocked us all.\"",
      "\"All my customers nip down to the local pubs and restaurants, 25% of them fly in from overseas from places like America and Australia, using local taxis and train services and spending a fortune locally,\" he added.",
      "He urged the Welsh government \"to fund Welsh Water to continue to maintain water levels and keep all the operators of this canal in business - it cannot be lost\".",
      "Gavin Bown from Natural Resources Wales said regulating water abstraction was \"a complex, evidence-based process that carefully balances environmental needs with those of local communities\".",
      "\"Our priority is to protect the integrity of the River Usk and the Severn Estuary, both designated as special areas of conservation,\" he explained, adding the regulator would continue to work collaboratively with the Canal and River Trust.",
      "A Welsh Water spokesman said the River Usk was \"one of the primary sources of drinking water to around 250,000 customers across south east Wales\".",
      "But it remained \"one of our least drought-resilient supply areas\", with limited water resources to deal with the impacts of climate change and population growth.",
      "\"We have proposed in the driest of years to supply some customers with water from the River Tawe through an emergency pumping station and use this spare capacity in abstraction from the River Usk to support the canal,\" he explained.",
      "However this would come at a cost, with discussions ongoing over whether this would be affordable to the trust.",
      "\"To provide this free of charge or risk the future supply of drinking water to our customers, isn't an option for us,\" he said.",
      "The Welsh government said \"protecting and enhancing our environment and natural resources is key to addressing the climate and nature emergencies\".",
      "\"The limits placed on the licences were in line with the amounts applied for by the Canal & River Trust,\" a spokesperson said.",
      "They added any arrangement between the canal and Welsh Water would be a commercial contractual decision in which the Welsh government should play no role.",

    "story": [
      "Imagine an electric drone mixed with a fixed wing plane - that is the concept behind a new two-seater aircraft being developed by start-up company, Skyfly.",
      "The Axe promises the flexibility of a helicopter but without the cost, noise pollution or carbon emissions.",
      "It is a vertically capable aircraft, or Electric Vertical Take-off and Landing (eVTOL) aircraft, which means it can take off like a helicopter.",
      "It also has two fixed wings that allows it to take off and land from a runway.",
      "The company claims the Axe has a top speed of 100mph, it can carry up to 172kg - approximately the weight of two 13.5st adults - and has a range of 100 miles, about the distance from Oxford to the Isle of Wight.",
      "The team, based near Banbury in Oxfordshire, has taken five years to fine tune the design.",
      "\"Compared to a conventional aircraft it's got eight motors which is very strange,\" says Dr Bill Brooks, Skyfly's chief technical engineer.",
      "\"And it's a tail-first layout called a canard so it's got the tail at the front.  The all up weight is 750kg but 240kg of that are batteries so all the structure is carbon fibre to keep it as light as possible,\" Dr Brooks says.",
      "Safety is an important part of the design too.",
      "'Environmental benefits'",
      "The large wings help it to glide in the event of power failure and there are two motors at the end of each wing so that if one fails the other can compensate.",
      "It is also equipped with an emergency ballistic parachute to bring the aircraft and passengers down safely.",
      "As well as being safer and cleaner than conventional aircraft, Michael Thompson, Skyfly's chief executive, says electric models are significantly quieter too.",
      "\"When you're taking off, you're no longer annoying everyone around you from a noise perspective, so I do think electric propulsion brings not only environmental benefits but from a noise pollution point of view, it's a huge benefit as well,\" he says.",
      "Who is it marketed at?",
      "Other eVTOLs under development include those looking to provide an electric flying-taxi service like Bristol-based Vertical Aerospace (VA) .",
      "VA, as well as Archer and Joby in the US, are designing electric powered aircraft to carry up to four passengers.",
      "Skyfly's Axe, by comparison, is more compact and aimed at the private market.",
      "The do-it-youself kit-plane comes with a price tag of \u00a3250,000.",
      "It is aimed at existing pilots who want to transition away from diesel piston engines.",
      "Jason Pritchard, executive editor of eVTOL Insights, says it is also likely to appeal to flying clubs in order to train new members:",
      "\"The eVTOL aircraft industry is still in its infancy with initial operations a few years away, but it also needs to train large numbers of pilots in the coming years,\" he says.",
      "\"Additionally, the Axe's design can also train pilots with the skills and controls necessary to land an aircraft without power, which is a necessary tool.\"",
      "What about charging infrastructure?",
      "While the Axe can be charged up overnight with a conventional three-pin plug, just like EV cars, electric aircraft will need the charging infrastructure to be scaled up.",
      "Aerovolt, based in West Sussex, has installed rapid chargers at seven UK airports with 40 more in the pipeline.",
      "Its founder, Philip Kingsley-Dobson, says demand is growing.",

    "story": [
      "Gothenburg, Sweden's second city, is highlighting its environmental credentials by continuing to put its money on the line.",
      "Back in 2022, the City of Gothenburg, became what is believed to be the first local government in the world to take out a \"sustainability linked loan\" or SLL.",
      "This is a form of financing pegged to a set of annual environmental and social improvements agreed between a borrower and its banks.",
      "Gothenburg's four target areas are efforts to make renewable energy the sole source of the city's heat production, making the council's own vehicle fleet electric, reducing energy usage in municipality-owned buildings, such as hospitals and schools, and improving the city's poorest neighbourhoods.",
      "Meet agreed annual improvement levels in these sectors and, for each, Gothenburg gets a discount on the yearly fee it pays for the loan of 0.1% or around 100,000 kronor ($10,500; \u00a38,000). But miss one of the targets by a certain amount and it has to pay a fine of the same amount.",
      "In 2022 and 2023 Gothenburg managed to avoid a financial penalty, but the newly released figures for 2024 show that it missed its target for switching to renewable energy. And so it is about to be fined 150,000 kroner.",
      "However, this is offset by the discounts it is getting for continuing to hit improvement levels for energy usage and social improvement. For electrifying the council's vehicles, while it missed its improvement goal, it didn't do so by enough to be fined.",
      "Fredrik Block, portfolio manager at the City of Gothenburg, says that the local authority deliberately set \"ambitious\" targets.",
      "\"You aim high, and you get the whole organisation to strive towards that target. We are not proceeding as fast as we expected, but we are taking one step at a time. The goal is still to be close to carbon-free by 2030.",
      "\"We're actually not doing it for the money. We're doing it to show the city's important work and that we are making progress every year. We want to show to the world how it is - that these are the problems, and these are the good things.\"",
      "The improvements to the city's poorest areas \u2013 and whether the council has hit its targets - are measured by yearly resident surveys. People are asked about their feelings towards an area's safety and cleanliness.",
      "Key initiatives have included making housing more secure, introducing more surveillance cameras and increasing police presence as a crime prevention measure in areas of the city like Hjallbo and Biskopsgarden. Located in the north of the city, they have high levels of crime and unemployment, and large immigrant populations.",
      "Public housing agency Framtiden, which is ultimately owned by the City of Gothenburg, says it takes the improvement work very seriously.",
      "\"For some of these vulnerable areas, we actually own the majority of the housing,\" says its research and development manager, Lars Bankvall.",
      "\"We are more or less the only official body in these areas. There's no one else there, only us.",
      "\"I see us as maybe the most powerful tool that the city has, because we have a lot of financial resources. We are involved in everything.\"",
      "But Faduma Awil, a social worker who now provides career coaching at an employment centre in Gothenburg, is concerned that increased cameras and police presence sends the wrong message to youth in Gothenburg's deprived areas - and could see racial profiling increase.",
      "\"What will our children think when they see cameras everywhere in Hjallbo, but none in a Swedish neighbourhood? How will they feel when they are constantly being watched by police?\" she says.",
      "\"What will you tell them? You are showing them there is a difference between them and native Swedes.\"",
      "Ms Awil is also not convinced the resident surveys are effective or accurate. And she feels the city is placing a disproportionate amount of effort into its environmental goals, at the expense of improving conditions in underprivileged areas.",
      "\"People in these areas don't care about the environment. They need to go to school. They need to work. They need to eat,\" says Ms Awil, who migrated from Somalia to Sweden in 1987 as a child.",
      "Negotiating an SLL is a rigorous, complex process - one that took the City of Gothenburg a year to do, with no fewer than six major Nordic banks involved.",
      "Such is the difficulty of acquiring an SLL that the number issued globally fell by 56% in 2023, according to data from financial news provider Bloomberg.",
      "Mats Olausson is senior sustainability advisor at Swedish bank SEB, which is the lead lender of Gothenburg's SLL.",
      "He says SEB has turned down potential SLL borrowers as the client's proposed targets weren't ambitious enough. Yet he adds that SLLs are challenging for companies or local authorities that successfully get one.",
      "\"It's sad if a company puts a lot of resources into designing an SLL, and then it turns out that the only publicity they get is negative,\" he says. \"You run the risk of being pulled into the dirt for having not done a good enough job.",
      "\"It's in no one's interest to have targets that are overly ambitious and basically impossible to achieve, or for companies who don't have the right governance in place to implement the actions that will be the building blocks of the actual strategy.\"",
      "One company that is happy with its SLL is Danish management consultancy Emagine. It borrowed \u00a310m in 2021, funds that helped it to acquire six other firms around the world.",
      "Its binding goals include increasing the number of female leaders in the organisation by 16%, and reducing overall employee turnover by 6% over the seven-year long period. It is doing this through leadership and mentoring programs.",
      "By meeting the targets, Emagine is benefiting from reduced interest rates, says Lars Bloch, the company's chief financial officer.",
      "\"If we didn't meet the goals, we would be landed with interest penalty rates. We also accept that failing to meet sustainability targets could harm the firm's reputation, as we have made a public commitment.",
      "\"It shouldn't be about committing to the loan to get a discount on financing - there needs to be ambition behind the goals.\"",

      "\"Banks want to give money to sustainable cities, so packaging up our progress in our SLL reporting is how I make the city beautiful for investors,\" he says.",

    "story": [
      "The climate action group Just Stop Oil has announced it is to disband at the end of April. Its activists have been derided as attention-seeking zealots and vandals and it is loathed by many for its disruptive direct action tactics. It says it has won because its demand that there should be no new oil and gas licences is now government policy.  So, did they really win and does this mark an end to the chaos caused by its climate protests?",
      "Hayley Walsh's heart was racing as she sat in the audience at the Theatre Royal Drury Lane on 27 January this year.",
      "The 42 year-old lecturer and mother of three tried to calm her breathing. Hollywood star Sigourney Weaver was onstage in her West End debut production of Shakespeare's The Tempest.",
      "But Hayley, a Just Stop Oil activist, had her own drama planned.",
      "As Weaver's Prospero declaimed \"Come forth, I say,\" Hayley sprang from her seat and rushed the stage with Richard Weir, a 60-year-old mechanical engineer from Tyneside.",
      "They launched a confetti cannon and unfurled a banner that read \"Over 1.5 Degrees is a Global Shipwreck\" - a reference to the news that 2024 was the first year to pass the symbolic 1.5C threshold in global average temperature rise, and a nod to the shipwreck theme in the play.",
      "It was a classic Just Stop Oil (JSO) action. The target was high profile and would guarantee publicity. The message was simple and presented in the group's signature fluorescent orange.",
      "The reaction of those affected was also a classic response to JSO.  Amid the boos and whistles you can hear a shout of \"idiots\".",
      "\"Drag them off the stage\", one audience member can be heard shouting, \"I hope you [expletive] get arrested,\" another says.",
      "JSO is a UK-based environmental activist group that aims to end fossil fuel extraction and uses direct action to draw attention to its cause. It has been called a \"criminal cult\" and its activists branded \"eco-loons\" by the Sun. The Daily Mail has described it as \"deranged\" and says its members have \"unleashed misery on thousands of ordinary people though their selfish antics\".",
      "The group has thrown soup at a Van Gogh in the National Gallery, exploded a chalk dust bomb during the World Snooker Championship in Sheffield, smashed a cabinet containing a copy of the Magna Carta at the British Library, sprayed temporary paint on the stones of Stonehenge and even defaced Charles Darwin's grave.",
      "But it is the group's road protests that have probably caused the most disruption \u2013 and public anger. In November 2022, 45 JSO members climbed gantries around the M25 severely disrupting traffic for over four days. People missed flights, medical appointments and exams as thousands of drivers were delayed for hours. The cost to the Metropolitan Police was put at \u00a31.1 million.",
      "Just Stop Oil was born out of Extinction Rebellion (XR).  XR \u2013 founded in 2018 - brought thousands of people onto the streets in what were dubbed \"festivals of resistance\".  They came to a peak in April 2019, when protestors brought parts of the capital to a halt for more than a week and plonked a large pink boat in the middle of Oxford Circus.",
      "The spectacle and disruption XR caused generated massive media attention, but the police were furious.  Hundreds of officers were diverted from frontline duties and by the end of 2019 the bill for policing the protests had reached \u00a337m.",
      "And behind the scenes XR was riven by furious debates about tactics.  Many inside the movement said it should be less confrontational and disruptive but a hard core of activists argued it would be more effective to double down on direct action.",
      "It became clear that there was room for what Sarah Lunnon, one of the co-founders of Just Stop Oil, calls \"a more radical flank\".  They decided a new, more focused operation was needed, modelled on earlier civil disobedience movements like the Suffragettes, Gandhi's civil disobedience campaigns and the civil rights movement in the US.",
      "The group was formally launched on Valentine's Day, 2022. It was a very different animal to XR. Instead of thousands of people taking part in street carnivals, JSO's actions involved a few committed activists. A small strategy group oversaw the campaign and meticulously planned its activities. A mobilisation team worked to recruit new members, and another team focused on supporting activists after they were arrested.",
      "The dozens of actions the group has carried out generated lots of publicity, but also massive public opposition. There were confrontations between members of the public and protestors and an outcry from politicians across all the main political parties.",
      "The police said they needed more powers to deal with this new form of protest and they got them. New offences were created including interfering with national infrastructure, \"locking on\" \u2013 chaining or gluing yourself to something \u2013 and tunnelling underground. Causing a public nuisance also became a potential crime \u2013 providing the police with a powerful new tool to use against protestors who block roads.",
      "In the four years since it was formed dozens of the group's supporters have been jailed. Five activists were handed multi-year sentences for their role in the M25 actions in 2022. Those were reduced on appeal earlier this month but are still the longest jail terms for non-violent civil disobedience ever issued.",
      "Senior JSO members deny the crackdown had anything to do with the group's decision to \"hang up the hi-vis\" \u2013 as its statement this week announcing the end of campaign put it.",
      "JSO's public position is that it has won its battle. \"Just Stop Oil's initial demand to end new oil and gas is now government policy, making us one of the most successful civil resistance campaigns in recent history,\" the group claimed.",
      "The government has said it does not plan to issue any new licences for oil and gas production but strongly denies its policies have a link to JSO. Furthermore, the Prime Minister's official spokesperson told journalists: \"We have been very clear when it comes to oil and gas that it has a future for decades to come in our energy mix.\"",
      "And the group's wider goal \u2013 to end the production of oil and gas \u2013 has manifestly not been achieved. The members of the group I spoke to for this article all agree the climate crisis has deepened.",
      "In the face of stiffer sentences, some climate campaigners have said they will turn to more clandestine activities. One new group says it plans a campaign of sabotage against key infrastructure. In a manifesto published online it says it plans to \"kickstart a new phase of the climate activist movement, aiming to shut down key actors of the fossil fuel economy.\"",
      "That's not a direction the JSO members I spoke to said they wanted to go. Sarah Lunnon said a key principle of JSO and the civil disobedience movement generally was that activists would take responsibility for their actions. One of the first questions new joiners were asked is whether they would be willing to be locked up.",
      "\"As corporations and billionaires corrupt political systems across the world, we need a different approach.",
      "\"We are creating a new strategy, to face this reality and to carry our responsibilities at this time,\" the group says, suggesting they may be planning to form a new movement.",
      "JSO's most high-profile figure, Roger Hallam, is one of the five activists convicted for their role in the M25 protests. In a message from his prison cell he acknowledged that JSO has only had a \"marginal impact\".",
      "That is \"not due to lack of trying,\" he said. The failure lay with the UK's \"elites and our leaders\" who had walked away from their responsibility to tackle the climate crisis, Hallam claimed. A hint perhaps that the group's new focus might be on the political system itself.",
      "JSO has said its last protest \u2013 to be held at the end of April \u2013 will mark \"the end of soup on Van Goghs, cornstarch on Stonehenge and slow marching in the streets\". But don't believe it. When pressed, the JSO members I spoke to said they may well turn back to disruptive tactics but under a new name and with a new and as yet unspecified objective.",

      "They also note that the study's reliance on survey data of self-reported experiences may mean it contains biases, and its findings should not be considered globally representative.",
      "Joshua Piper, a sleep clinician at ResMed UK, said the study provided \"valuable, mounting evidence\" of electronic device use negatively impacting sleep.",
      "\"It steals both opportunity and the quality of your sleep, which is why some may struggle for onset, others struggle to stay asleep,\" he told the BBC.",
      "While people may try to mitigate the impact by adjusting screen brightness or using night mode, Mr Piper said previous studies suggested it was scrolling and engaging with a device that was likely to cause sleep disruptions.",

      "While common practice, the actual impact of using social media or scrolling through online content in bed on physical and mental health remains contested.",
      "Still, experts recommend that people stop using digital devices shortly before trying to go to sleep.",
      "They also say establishing a routine by going to bed and getting up at the same time every day may help improve sleep.",
      "Mental health charities Mind and Rethink recommend trying to do something relaxing before going to sleep such as breathing exercises, reading a book or having a bath, rather than trying to force yourself to sleep.",
      "They also suggest avoiding caffeine, alcohol or large meals before bed, doing gentle exercise and trying to make your bedroom more comfortable, where possible.",
      "Sleep therapist Dr Kat Lederle told the BBC that getting exposure to natural daylight, particularly in the morning, was vital to help regulate our internal body clock.",
      "She said finding ways to \"let go of the busy, thinking day\", such as by doing an enjoyable activity that is not too stimulating, can also be key to better sleep.",
      "The authors of this study echo the need for further research into the subject, including longer-term monitoring of sleep patterns as well as investigations into areas such as the disruption caused overnight by device notifications.",

    "summary": "The president says he would like TikTok to 'remain alive' as his extended deadline for its sale-or-ban approaches.",
    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump has said a deal to sell TikTok will be made by 5 April, as questions swirl over whether the app will be banned in the United States.",
      "The platform 'went dark' for US users in January as a law took effect which banned the app unless it was sold by its parent company ByteDance.",
      "But TikTok returned less than a day later following Trump's election win, and he signed an executive order delaying its sale or ban by 75 days.",
      "Tech companies, celebrities and investors have since lined up to buy the app.",
      "Has Trump overturned the US TikTok ban?",
      "An executive order is an instruction from the president which has the weight of the law behind it.",
      "Trump signed such an order regarding TikTok's sale or ban on 21 January, shortly after his inauguration.",
      "But the president's order does not overturn the ban.",
      "Instead it tells the US attorney general not to enforce the law for now - something experts had expected would be his first move.",
      "That buys time for his administration to, as the order puts it, \"determine the appropriate course of action\".",
      "It allows the president to directly oppose a ruling by the Supreme Court upholding the law to ban TikTok on 17 January.",
      "The Supreme Court's ruling said the ban was \"designed to prevent China - a designated foreign adversary - from leveraging its control over ByteDance to capture the personal data of US TikTok users\".",
      "Could TikTok be banned again in the US?",
      "Trump's extended deadline for TikTok's sale or ban gives ByteDance until 5 April to find a buyer.",
      "If no deal is reached the app could once again face a US ban and be pulled from mobile app stores.",
      "However, Trump could allow the law to stand but tell the Department of Justice (DoJ) to continue to ignore it.",
      "The government would be effectively telling Apple and Google they will not be punished for allowing people to download TikTok onto their devices - meaning the law would remain in place but would essentially be redundant.",
      "TikTok returned to Google's Play Store and Apple's App Store in February, after the companies were reportedly told they would not face consequences for hosting it.",
      "Trump has also said he would \"probably\" extend the deadline, if needed.",
      "Could TikTok ever be banned in the UK too?",
      "Who might buy TikTok?",
      "ByteDance has long insisted that TikTok is not for sale, and whether that has changed under Trump's presidency remains unclear.",
      "The president told reporters on 30 March there were \"a lot of potential buyers\" and \"tremendous interest\" in buying the app.",
      "He said earlier in March his administration was talking to four different groups about a potential sale.",
      "Trump appears to want to find a compromise that complies with the spirit rather than the letter of law.",
      "He has also floated the idea of TikTok being jointly owned - telling reporters he was seeking a 50-50 partnership between \"the United States\" and ByteDance.",
      "Meanwhile, several names have been floated as potential buyers of the company.",
      "Trump said he would be open to selling TikTok to Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison, as well as Elon Musk.",
      "Previous names linked with buying TikTok include billionaire Frank McCourt and the Canadian businessman Kevin O'Leary - a celebrity investor on Shark Tank, the US version of Dragon's Den.",
      "Alexis Ohanian, who co-founded Reddit, said in a post on X in March he had joined Mr McCourt's bid.",
      "\"The list of people who do not want to buy TikTok is much smaller than the list who do,\" Mr Musk replied.",
      "The biggest YouTuber in the world Jimmy Donaldson - AKA MrBeast - has also claimed he is in the running after a number of investors contacted him following an earlier tweet signalling his interest.",
      "Companies including Microsoft are even among those involved in discussions to buy TikTok, according to Trump.",
      "A US search engine called Perplexity AI has also reportedly offered to merge with TikTok.",
      "What other platforms could TikTok users use instead?",
      "TikTok says it has 170 million US users who spent - on average - 51 minutes per day on the app in 2024.",
      "Experts say rivals such as Instagram Reels and YouTube Shorts could benefit if Trump's efforts to fully restore TikTok don't succeed.",
      "Users bring advertisers - so this could be a big financial boost to those platforms.",
      "\"Chief marketing officers who we've spoken with confirmed that they will divert their media dollars to Meta and Google if they can no longer advertise on TikTok,\" said Kelsey Chickering, an analyst at market research company Forrester.",
      "Other potential winners include Twitch, which made its name by hosting livestreams - a popular feature on TikTok. Twitch is well known particularly to gamers, though its other content is expanding too.",
      "Other Chinese-owned platforms, such as Xiaohongshu - known as RedNote among its US users - have also seen rapid growth in the US and the UK."

      "Wikipedia is one of the most visited websites in the world but, by the admission of some of its own volunteer editors, it suffers from a persistent problem - terrible pictures, particularly of celebrities.",
      "It is so full of notable people with very old or unflattering photographs that there are even Instagram accounts dedicated to the very worst ones.",
      "The problem arises because professional photographers who attend, for example, film premieres tend to work for big agencies: their work is copyrighted and you usually need to pay to reproduce it.",

      "Le Pen's bid to become France's next president in 2027 was dealt a dramatic blow on Monday, when judges said she had been at the heart of an operation which saw the embezzlement of \u20ac2.9m ($3.4m; \u00a32.5m) of EU funds between 2004 and 2016.",
      "Bardella, the president of the National Rally (RN) party, said the French had to be \"outraged\" by the sentence.",

      "\"We'll take to the streets this weekend,\" Bardella said during a press conference on Tuesday, with a call for \"democratic, peaceful, calm mobilisations\". The first event is planned for Place Vauban close to the Eiffel Tower on Sunday.",
      "Sitting beside him, Le Pen said a \"nuclear bomb\" had been used used against the RN to stop the party getting into power.",
      "The longtime figurehead of the French far right added that the \"system\" had used a \"powerful weapon\" against the RN, \"evidently because we are about to win the elections\".",
      "\"We won't let them get away with it,\" she added. People had to use their \"outrage and hurt\" to motivate them to persevere: \"We will hold on until the end, until victory.\"",
      "Earlier on Tuesday, Bardella condemned the \"tyranny of the judges\" and said that \"everything was being done to stop us from getting to power\".",
      "He also criticised the insults that the judges have received since handing down the sentence on Monday, as did Le Pen, who said any threats to magistrates were \"unacceptable\".",
      "They were echoing R\u00e9my Heitz, the prosecutor general at the Court of Cassation - the highest court in France - who said earlier on Tuesday that there had been \"very personalised attacks\" and threats against the three judges who had determined Monday's verdicts.",
      "Citing a police source, newspaper Le Figaro reported that B\u00e9n\u00e9dicte de Perthuis, the president judge in the Le Pen case, had been placed under protection following threats.",
      "Le Pen was gearing up to run for the presidency for a fourth time and had a good chance of winning. She is clearly reluctant to hand the baton to Jordan Bardella, who at 29 is seen by some as lacking the experience necessary to hold France's highest office.",
      "Since she has been ruled ineligible, Le Pen has said she will not \"let herself be eliminated like this\". Bardella has steered clear of being drawn into the discussion at this stage, refusing to say whether he was National Rally's \"plan B\".",
      "However, RN spokesman Laurent Jacobelli said that although the party would fight to have Le Pen as candidate, Bardella was \"the most naturally legitimate\" alternative.",
      "Voters may agree. A poll published a day before Le Pen was sentenced showed that around 60% of RN voters would back Bardella over Le Pen at the presidential election if he were to run, and that he would come out top with up to 36% of the total vote.",
      "Le Pen has garnered the support of several rightwingers in Europe and beyond, including Hungary's Viktor Orban and US President Donald Trump, who said her conviction was a \"very big deal\".",
      "And Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni said \"no-one who cares about democracy can rejoice at a sentence that... deprives millions of citizens of representation\".",
      "On top of the ban on running for public office, Le Pen was also handed a \u20ac100,000 (\u00a382,635) fine and four-year prison sentence, of which two will be suspended.",

      "Multiple earthquakes have occurred in the volcanic area throughout the day.",
      "The volcano is close to the fishing town of Grindavik and the famous Blue Lagoon spa. A small number of people refused to evacuate the town, local media reported.",

      "Living near the volcano for most of her life meant she always had bags packed and ready to go. But she said this time was different because of \"constant\" quakes as she was preparing to leave.",

      "It was \"extremely difficult\" to see this activity inside the town's safety barriers, said Ms Kristinsdottir, who serves as president of Grindavik town council.",
      "People had been asked to \"leave the danger zone\", the region's police commissioner Ulfar Ludviksson told Iceland's RUV broadcaster. But he said individuals staying in \"seven or eight houses there... have decided to remain in the town\".",
      "There were fears that the town was \"in danger of having lava flows entering the inhabited area\", said Rikke Pedersen from the Nordic Volcanological Centre.",

      "Thormar Omarrson runs a pizza restaurant in Grindavik that was forced to close due to the eruption.",

      "Leaving was \"heartbreaking\", Mr Omarrson said. \"My family was born and raised there and now their community is gone.\"",
      "He said some of his friends in Grindavik had refused to evacuate: \"When you live there in your home you want to be left alone in your home.\"",
      "Most of the 4,000 residents of Grindavik left in a mass evacuation in 2023 because of the dangers of the volcanic activity. The volcano has erupted several times since.",
      "The length of the magma that formed on Tuesday under the crater series stretched to about 11 km (6.8 miles) - the longest that has been measured since 11 November 2023, meteorologists said. The magma corridor extends about 3km further northeast than seen in previous eruptions.",
      "Based on current wind direction, gas pollution from the eruption will travel northeast towards the capital area, the IMO added.",
      "The eruption, which began around 09.45 local time (10:45 BST), occurred after several earthquakes hit the area known as the Sundhnuk crater range.",
      "Multiple eruptions have occurred on the Reykjanes Peninsula since 2021.",
      "The last time the peninsula had a period of volcanic activity was 800 years ago - and the eruptions continued for decades.",

    "story": [
      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has denounced an investigation into possible links between his aides and Qatar as a \"witch hunt\", after he gave testimony to police.",
      "An adviser and a former spokesman were arrested on Monday over alleged payments from the Gulf Arab state as part of the probe, which has been dubbed \"Qatar-gate\". They have denied any wrongdoing.",
      "Netanyahu, who has not been named as a suspect, accused the police of holding the two men as \"hostages\", adding: \"There is no case.\"",
      "A Qatari official also dismissed the probe as a \"smear campaign\" against Qatar, which has played a key role as a mediator between Israel and Hamas during the war in Gaza.",
      "It comes as Netanyahu faces escalating protests in Israel over his policies, including the resumption of Israel's offensive against Hamas before securing the release of all the remaining hostages, the dismissal of the director of the Shin Bet internal security agency, and the advancement of a controversial plan to overhaul the judiciary.",
      "Israel's Supreme Court freezes PM's order to sack security chief",
      "Prominent Jewish figures boycott Israel antisemitism event over far-right guests",
      "On Monday, Israel's police force announced that two suspects had been detained as part of an investigation into ties between the prime minister's office and Qatar. It provided no further details, citing a court-imposed gag order on the case.",
      "Israeli media reports subsequently identified them as Yonatan Urich, a very close adviser to Netanyahu, and Eli Feldstein, a former spokesman in the prime minister's office, and said they were suspected of contact with a foreign agent, money laundering, bribery, fraud, and breach of trust.",
      "Netanyahu later cut short an appearance at his separate trial on corruption charges, which he denies, to provide recorded testimony to police investigating the case at his office in Jerusalem.",
      "After being questioned, Netanyahu posted a video online in which he condemned both the arrests and the wider investigation.",
      "\"I understood that it was a political investigation but I didn't realise how political it was,\" he said. \"They are holding Jonatan Urich and Eli Feldstein as hostages, making their lives miserable over nothing.\"",
      "\"There is no case, there is absolutely nothing, just a political witch hunt, nothing else.\"",
      "The prime minister's Likud party also issued a statement accusing the attorney general's office and the Shin Bet chief of \"fabricating\" the case and attempting to \"terrorise Yonatan Urich in order to extract from him false testimony against the prime minister through blackmail\".",
      "On Tuesday, a judge at Rishon LeZion Magistrates' Court extended Urich and Feldstein's detention by three days, saying there were \"reasonable suspicions\" that required a thorough investigation. The police had requested a nine-day extension.",
      "Judge Menahem Mizrahi said in a decision that investigators suspected that the two men had acted to \"promote Qatar in a positive light\" and \"spread negative messages about Egypt\" and its role as another mediator in the Gaza ceasefire talks.",
      "For this purpose, the judge said, a \"business and economic connection\" was created between a US lobbying firm working for Qatar \"through the mediation of [Urich] in return for monetary payments which were passed to [Feldstein]\" through an Israeli businessman.",
      "Last week, Israeli media published a recording in which the businessman was heard saying that he had transferred funds to Feldstein on behalf of a US lobbyist working for Qatar.",
      "At the time, Feldstein's lawyers said the payments were \"for strategic and communications services Feldstein provided to the prime minister's office, not for Qatar\". They also said Feldstein was not aware of any connection between the businessman and other parties, including Qatar. Ulrich's lawyers said he denied involvement.",
      "A police representative told Judge Mizrahi on Tuesday that Urich was also suspected of passing journalists messages from a source linked to Qatar, which were presented as if they came from senior Israeli political or security officials.",
      "Ulrich's legal team, which includes Netanyahu's defence lawyer Amit Hadad, said they would submit a request to lift the gag order on the case to expose \"the injustice done to him\". The judge went on to approve the request, saying the gag order had been repeatedly violated.",
      "A Qatari official told the Financial Times: \"This is not the first time we have been the subject of a smear campaign by those who do not want to see an end to this conflict [the Gaza war] or the remaining hostages returned to their families.\"",
      "Qatar has long championed the Palestinian cause and host political leaders of Hamas, which is proscribed as a terrorist organisation by Israel, the UK, the US and other countries.",
      "Between 2018 and the start of the current war, which was triggered by Hamas's 7 October 2023 attack on Israel, the Gulf state provided hundreds of millions of dollars of aid for Gaza.",
      "Israeli governments allowed the money to be transferred to pay the wages of civil servants in Gaza's Hamas-run government, support the poorest families, and fund fuel deliveries for the territory's sole power plant. However, critics asserted that it was helping Hamas to stay in power and fund its military activities.",
      "Since the war, Qatar has helped, along with the US and Egypt, to broker two ceasefire and hostage release deals between Israel and Hamas.",
      "The most recent lasted between 19 January and 18 March, when Israel renewed its air and ground campaign, blaming Hamas for rejecting a new US proposal for an extension and the release of its 59 remaining hostages. Hamas accused Israel of violating the original deal.",
      "Netanyahu claimed that the \"sole purpose\" of the Qatar-gate investigation was to prevent the dismissal of the director of the Shin Bet domestic security agency, which has been participating in the probe, and to \"topple a right-wing prime minister\".",
      "The government fired Ronen Bar on 21 March, saying it had lost trust in him over the failure to prevent Hamas's deadly attack on Israel on 7 October 2023, which triggered the war in Gaza.",
      "However, the supreme court suspended the dismissal pending a hearing on 8 April in response to petitions from opposition political parties and a non-governmental organisation, which said the move was made for inappropriate reasons and constituted a severe conflict of interest.",
      "Bar will remain in post until the supreme court rules on the petitions, although the court permitted the prime minister to interview potential replacements in the meantime.",
      "On Tuesday, Netanyahu's office announced that he had reversed a decision made the previous day to appoint former navy commander Vice Adm Eli Sharvit as the next Shin Bet chief.",
      "\"The prime minister thanked Vice Adm Sharvit for his willingness to be called to duty but informed him that, after further consideration, he intends to examine other candidates,\" a statement said.",
      "That decision came after Likud officials criticised Sharvit's participation in the 2023 mass protests against the judicial overhaul.",
      "US Republican Senator Lindsey Graham also described Sharvit's appointment as \"problematic\" in response to a recent article criticising President Donald Trump's policies on climate change."

    "summary": "European rightwingers have voiced support for the French far-right politician after she was banned from running for public office.",
    "story": [
      "Marine Le Pen is an icon of France's nationalist right: one of the country's best-known and most popular political figures - with her France First, anti-woke, anti-migration agenda.",
      "Hard-right leaders, currently growing in support across much of Europe, view her as \"one of the gang\" - even if they don't see eye to eye on every issue.",
      "Many of these leaders took to social media on Monday, after Le Pen was banned from running for political office for five years having been found guilty, alongside others, of embezzling \u20ac2.9m ($3.4m; \u00a32.5m) of EU funds for use in France by her National Rally party.",
      "For them, this was an opportunity, not simply to show support for Le Pen but to use her case to highlight what they see as their common cause \u2013 a struggle against a politically traditional mainstream, that seeks to muzzle or undermine their nationalist agenda.",
      "But for Le Pen, this could be the death knell of her long-cherished ambition to become French president. She'd been riding high in the polls ahead of the next election, scheduled in two years' time.",
      "She and her political associates insist they're innocent. They're appealing against the verdict.",
      "Shock Le Pen verdict rocks French far right",
      "Le Pen attacks ban from running for public office as 'political decision'",
      "Marine Le Pen hits back in EU funds misuse trial",
      "In a flamboyant show of solidarity on Monday, Hungary's controversial Prime Minister, Viktor Orban, declared in a post on X in French \"Je suis Marine\" (\"I am Marine\").",
      "Populist Geert Wilders, the leader of the Netherlands' largest political party, posted on X he was sure Le Pen would win her appeal and that she would be France's next president.",
      "Italy's hard-line deputy prime minister, Matteo Salvini, also took to social media: \"We are not intimidated... full speed ahead, my friend!\".",
      "\"Those who fear the judgment of voters often seek reassurance from the courts. In Paris, they have condemned Marine Le Pen and would like to remove her from political life\", he wrote.",
      "France's courts deny they are politicised. They say their job is to administer justice. Many in France, 57% according to a poll by BFMTV, believe that justice was served in the Le Pen case without bias.",
      "But a suspicion that the court was biased - determined to block the political success of self-declared voice-of-the-people Le Pen - was echoed by supporters in and outside France on Monday.",
      "From Russia, even the Kremlin chimed in. Dmitry Peskov, spokesman for President Vladimir Putin, displayed a sudden interest in democracy, declaring that \"Marine Le Pen's situation constitutes a violation of democratic norms\".",
      "In a number of European countries, national legal systems appear caught in the middle in a new era of deep divisions and suspicions in society - leading to a tug of war between populist politicians and their detractors - each accusing the other of using the judiciary to protect their own political interests. France, Romania and Hungary are recent examples.",
      "As is the United States.",
      "Donald Trump declared the Le Pen conviction a \"very important matter.\"",
      "Speaking at a White House signing ceremony on Monday, Trump added: \"[Le Pen] was banned for five years and she was the leading candidate.\"",
      "\"That sounds like this country, that sounds very much like this country.\"",
      "When he faced a number of legal challenges ahead of the US presidential election in November, Trump attacked all those involved in the lawsuits against him, as well as the media whose investigative work on him he again called \"illegal\" last month.",
      "But now he's back in the White House, he's been accused by critics of trying to use the courts to enact revenge on political opponents.",
      "His legal woes clearly didn't harm his political fortunes though.",
      "Back in France, it is possible that - whatever happens to Le Pen politically - her party will benefit and grow in popularity from all the media attention surrounding Monday's sentencing, the appeal case that will follow and a sense of defiance amongst a big chunk of voters at a French Establishment they believe is trying to stifle the will of the people - robbing them of their popular choice for president."

    "published": "Tue, 01 Apr 2025 10:06:59 GMT",
    "summary": "A nationwide vote would be difficult, but some say there are good reasons to hold one soon.",
    "story": [
      "As Ukrainian cities are bombed almost nightly by Russia, the idea of holding elections here might seem fanciful.",
      "But in the streets and offices of the capital, Kyiv, the prospect of the country going to the polls is once again being discussed.",
      "Election rumours have come and gone in the three long years of Russia's full-scale war.",
      "Each time they have been dismissed by government, opposition and public alike, arguing unity of effort against the Russian invader must come first.",
      "A presidential election due in 2024 was suspended in line with martial law, which was introduced in Ukraine following Russia's full-scale invasion two years earlier.",
      "But that hasn't stopped the Kremlin from claiming President Volodymyr Zelensky is an illegitimate leader and demanding new elections as a condition of a ceasefire deal \u2013 a talking point which has been repeated by President Trump.",
      "BBC Verify on why elections in Ukraine were suspended",
      "BBC Verify on why elections in Ukraine were suspended",
      "Now there has been a fresh flurry of speculation that Zelensky might just be thinking again as ceasefire talks proceed, and some sources speaking to the BBC suggest there are reasons to think elections could go ahead later this year.",
      "The president's potential closest rival, Valerii Zaluzhnyi, former commander in chief of Ukraine's army, has felt the need to deny rumours about his intentions.",
      "\"My answer to this has not changed,\" he told the RBC-Ukraine news agency. \"While the war continues, we all need to work to save the country, not think about elections. I don't comment on any rumours.\"",
      "That the publicity-shy Zaluzhnyi, currently Ukraine's ambassador in London, felt the need to issue a statement was striking in itself.",
      "The head of Ukraine's Central Election Commission, Oleh Didenko, also chose to speak publicly about the speculation.",
      "He told the Ukrainska Pravda news website the law would have to be changed before any elections could take place. He said current rules stated that parliamentary elections must be held 60 days after the lifting of martial law, and 90 days for presidential elections.",
      "But more time would be needed because of the war and that would require legal changes.",
      "The Economist newspaper claimed Zelensky held a meeting last week to discuss an election and instructed staff to prepare for a vote once the United States had forced Russia into accepting a ceasefire, potentially as early as Easter.",
      "This report was denied by several government sources.",
      "\"There is fake information there,\" one presidential source told BBC News Ukrainian. \"There was no such meeting and there was no such instruction.\"",
      "The government source said the main focus was achieving peace and there was little hope of the war ending by Easter.",
      "So in the face of so many public denials, why do some still think an election might be in the offing?",
      "First, some sources note Zelensky's support in the polls has picked up since he was harangued by Donald Trump and Vice-President JD Vance in the White House.",
      "A poll by the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology (KIIS) in March suggested the number of Ukrainians who trusted Zelensky was up a couple of points on the previous month at 69%.",
      "Diplomats say the president might think now was his best chance of winning a second term rather than wait until political divisions emerge after the war.",
      "Second, by winning a second term, Zelensky would call Russia's bluff and strengthen his hand in any long-term peace negotiations. Only last week President Vladimir Putin said the United Nations should take over Ukraine and organise a \"democratic presidential election\". His assumption \u2013 perhaps mistaken - is that Zelensky would be replaced.",
      "Third, martial law must be renewed by parliamentary vote in early May. Zelensky could use that timetable to announce martial law would be allowed to lapse with elections held later in the summer.",
      "Fourth, the Americans are convinced elections are coming. Steve Witkoff, President Trump's special envoy, told the Tucker Carlson podcast on March 21: \"They've agreed to it. There will be elections in Ukraine.\"",
      "Zelensky could use this pressure from the US \u2013 echoing Russian narratives \u2013 as a pretext, telling voters he had no choice but to hold elections.",
      "Fifth, some Ukrainian sources believe logistical obstacles to elections can be overcome.",
      "Millions of citizens are displaced overseas, on the front line and in occupied territories. The answer to that, some say, is to allow people to vote using a smart phone app called Diia. This contains people's core documents such as passport, identity card and drivers' licence.",
      "Using Diia, some argue, would allow people to vote quickly, cheaply and safely without having to travel to a polling booth overseas or in the trenches. They point out Ukrainians have used it successfully to vote in the Eurovision Song Contest. They also note President Zelensky gave every Ukrainian almost \u00a320 as a winter allowance last December, with many registering for it using Diia.",
      "But there remain many arguments against elections.",
      "Using Diia would require new legislation that might struggle to get through parliament. Diia could be vulnerable to cyber-attack and technical failure. Western governments may not consider it trustworthy; Russia certainly would not.",
      "Even if Diia were used, identifying who could vote would still take time with incomplete and out-of-date registers.",
      "Lifting martial law during a temporary ceasefire could create unexpected consequences \u2013 including the flight of hundreds of thousands of soldiers from the front line \u2013 just as Russia prepared a counterattack. Russia could strike queues of voters at polling stations.",
      "Any elections, however quickly held, would allow war-time unity to be replaced by political rows. An election would allow Russia to deploy digital and other propaganda to try to shape the result.",
      "Holding an election may also be seen as accepting Russian arguments that Volodymyr Zelensky's leadership is illegitimate because of the suspended elections last year.",
      "Perhaps the strongest argument against elections is that Ukrainians themselves do not want them. That same March poll by the KIIS found about 78% of people opposed holding elections even after a complete settlement of the war."

    "story": [
      "Shares in the US have bounced back, despite tariff fears hitting stocks in Asia and Europe after US President Donald Trump suggested that he was planning import taxes that could hit \"all countries\".",
      "Trump's comments came as he prepares to unveil a massive slate of import taxes on Wednesday, in what he has called America's \"Liberation Day\".",
      "These will come on top of Trump's recent import taxes on aluminium, steel and cars, along with increased levies on all goods from China.",
      "The tougher stance from Trump has increased nervousness about a trade war hitting the global economy.",
      "Trump has offered conflicting signals about the scope of the expected tariffs, which have helped drive steep declines in the US stock market over the last month.",
      "Last week, he had raised the possibility that many countries could receive \"breaks\". But over the weekend, he appeared to be leaning toward a more wide-ranging plan.",
      "\"You'd start with all countries,\" Trump told reporters on Air Force One on Sunday. \"Essentially all of the countries that we're talking about.\"",
      "The UK has said it expects to be affected by US tariffs and is not ruling out retaliating.",
      "The prime minister's official spokesman has said talks on an economic deal between the two countries have been \"constructive\", but are likely to last beyond Wednesday.",
      "Other jurisdictions, such as the European Union and Canada, have already said that they are preparing a range of retaliatory trade measures.",
      "Concerns about the impact of the measures have unsettled markets and reignited fears of a recession in the US.",
      "What are tariffs and why is Trump using them?",
      "In the US, the S&P 500 share index of the largest firms has fallen almost 10% since mid-February, making March the worst month for the index in years.",
      "The Nasdaq is down more than 10%, its worst quarter since 2022.",
      "With significant uncertainty remaining about the 2 April announcement, shares in the US opened lower but ultimately held their ground on Monday.",
      "The Dow closed up 1%, while the S&P ended up 0.5% and the Nasdaq slipped just 0.1%.",
      "Earlier on Monday, Japan's Nikkei 225 benchmark share index closed more than 4% lower, while the Kospi in South Korea ended down 3%.",
      "In the UK, the FTSE 100 index fell nearly 0.9%, while Germany's Dax index closed down nearly 1.3% and France's Cac 40 fell roughly 1.6%.",
      "Gold, which is often seen as a safer investment when the economic backdrop is unstable, rose to another record high, hitting $3,128.06 an ounce.",
      "Shanti Kelemen, chief investment officer at M&G Wealth, told the BBC there could be \"quite a lot of uncertainty\" for a while given that previous tariff announcements have seen a lot of changes subsequently.",
      "Japan, which is a big player in exports, is among those countries most at risk from the changes, Ms Keleman said.",
      "\"They have a lot of automakers and also a very big presence in the semiconductor market, something that hasn't really been targeted yet but that could change,\" she noted.",
      "3 million US jobs?",
      "Trump sees tariffs - which are taxes imports - as a bargaining chip to get better trade terms, while also raising money and protecting the American economy from unfair competition.",
      "A White House fact sheet published last week also suggested that a 10% tariff on every import could create nearly three million US jobs.",
      "Trump trade adviser Peter Navarro has estimated that all the planned tariffs could raise $600bn annually, about a fifth of the value of total goods imports into the US.",
      "Many firms have said they expect the cost of the new tax to be passed onto customers in the form of higher prices.",
      "But that could lead to lower sales and fuel inflation in the US, a problem Trump had pledged on the campaign to tackle.",
      "Conversely, if companies decide to absorb the cost, it will hit their profits.",
      "'Counter-productive'",
      "Will Butler-Adams is chief executive of Brompton Bicycle, which makes folding bikes and relies on the US for about 10% of its sales.",
      "Brompton's products are not facing additional taxes yet.",
      "But Mr Butler-Adams said tariffs would make his bikes less competitive and force him to re-think his presence in the US.",
      "\"We won't continue to invest in the same way that we are now,\" he said. \"We may even shrink; in the extreme, we might pull out.\"",
      "Mr Butler-Adams said it had been hard to figure out the impact of tariffs that have already gone into effect, which require detailed accounting of how much steel in each item comes from outside the US.",
      "\"The reality is we don't [know] actually and the people who are on the borders importing goods into the US don't actually entirely understand how some of these tariffs might be put in,\" Mr Butler-Adams said.",
      "TikTok sale",
      "Separately, Trump said a deal with TikTok's Chinese owner ByteDance to sell the  app would be agreed before a deadline on Saturday.",
      "He set the 5 April deadline in January for the short video platform to find a non-Chinese buyer or face a ban in the US on national security grounds.",

      "The court ruled her statement where she claimed she was dragged from a party of 100 people was not convincing, as a friend testified seeing her simply go upstairs to a room with another person.",
      "While lab tests showed the woman had consumed significant amounts of alcohol and was also under the influence of narcotics (MDA and MDMA), the court ruled this was not to a degree that would deprive her of the ability to consent to sex \u2013 since she herself said she felt only \"slightly dizzy\" at the time.",
      "The court also determined that her claim that she shouted for help during the alleged gang rape was not convincing as two individuals from the adjacent room said they heard nothing.",
      "It specified that the woman told a police officer that she had non consensual sex with one person, but in subsequent statements changed it to two.",
      "The judges said in her first statement, she reported sexual acts were carried out by three individuals against her while identifying five men in the room. In her subsequent statement she reported five men of carrying out sexual acts.",
      "The court also concluded it could not be safely determined whether abrasions found on the woman's body were not sustained earlier and may have been a result of consensual intercourse.",

      "In a video that was posted online on Monday, Mr Whittall said: \"Seven days ago, Civil Defence and PRCS ambulances arrived at the scene. One by one they were hit, they were struck.

      "According to a recent public opinion survey, Weil narrowly trails Fine. An internal poll by a respected Republican firm reportedly showed Weil ahead by 3.",
      "That's enough to cause more than a little anxiety in Republican ranks.",
      "\"There's no excuse for a Republican not to win this race,\" said Randy Ross, a Florida-based conservative activist who campaigned there for Trump in 2016 and 2024. \"The only excuse that can possibly be had is Republicans weren't excited and didn't get out to vote.\"",

      "Within months, they fell in love and decided they wanted to spend their lives together.",

Srija and Arun, and Valli, are unique in choosing to live their everyday life out in the open.\"",
      "Srija and Arun's attempt to register their 2018 wedding was rejected, with the registrar arguing that the 1955 Hindu Marriage Act defined marriage as a union between a \"bride\" and a \"groom\", which therefore excluded trans women.",

      "She left the court early \u2013 just before hearing that she was barred from running for office for five years after being found guilty of embezzlement of EU funds \u2013 almost certainly ruling her out from standing in the 2027 French presidential election.",
      "Without even waiting for the judge to pronounce the full details of the sentence, the head of the National Rally knew that her political goose was cooked.",
      "There would be no reprieve pending appeal. The bar on running for office was real and immediate.",
      "A four-year prison sentence, of which two will be suspended, will be on hold pending appeal.",
      "But her political plans are dead.",
      "Le Pen's incredulity can be better excused, perhaps, in the context of the moment.",
      "A consensus had almost established itself across France's political world that this ultimate sanction by the court could not, would not \u2013 in the end \u2013 take place.",
      "It was not just Le Pen's followers who said it. Her enemies agreed, from Jean-Luc Melenchon on the far left to Prime Minister Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou in the centre and Justice Minister G\u00e9rard Darmanin on the right.",
      "Le Pen attacks ban from running for public office as 'political decision'",
      "Marine Le Pen hits back in EU funds misuse trial",
      "But they were all wrong.  The judge said that the law was the law.",
      "The law had in fact recently been toughened \u2013 by the very politicians who were now complaining about its application \u2013 to make the penalty for misuse of public funds very severe indeed.  Well, said the judge in so many words, now let politicians suck up their own medicine.",
      "Maybe Marine Le Pen was naive in not predicting this outcome. It certainly appears as if her National Rally party was singularly unprepared for it.",
      "So as they met in an emergency session after the verdict, party leaders were in a dilemma.",
      "Do they continue as if there is still a chance Marine Le Pen will run in 2027?",
      "In theory there is still a (small) possibility.  She has launched an appeal. The appeal could be accelerated and take place at the end of this year or early 2026. A verdict would follow in the spring.",
      "A different decision at the appeal hearing could lessen the period of ineligibility, or remove it altogether \u2013 in which case she could still run.  But the chances must be regarded as slim.",
      "Or, should they proceed with plan B \u2013 that is to say, with naming party president Jordan Bardella as de facto the man who will run in Marine Le Pen's place?",
      "That might be a more realistic assessment of what lies ahead. But to turn to Bardella too quickly would be unseemly.  And anyway, not everyone in the party is a fan.",
      "By the evening the choice had been made: in a TV appearance Marine Le Pen came out fighting, saying she had no plans to retreat from the political scene.",
      "Denouncing what she called a \"political\" decision by the judge and a \"violation of the state of law\", she called for a swift appeal trial, so that her name could be cleared \u2013 or at least the ineligibility lifted \u2013 in time for the 2027 vote.",
      "\"There are millions of French people who believe in me. For 30 years I have been fighting against injustice. It is what I shall continue to do right to the end,\" she said.",
      "Fighting words \u2013 but in reality the future looks very unclear. And there are many unanswered questions.",
      "What, for example, will the effect of the court decision be on the RN vote?",
      "In the short term we can expect an outcry, and a boost to the party's support.  Why? Because what has happened fits so neatly into the RN narrative that the populist right is a victim of the \"system\".",
      "No-one likely to vote for the RN seriously holds it against Marine Le Pen for illegally financing her party using EU parliament funds.  They all know that practically every French political party has resorted to similar underhand methods in the past.",
      "By the same token,  her \"draconian\" punishment \u2013 being banned from standing for the presidency \u2013 will be interpreted as a badge of honour: proof that she alone is standing up to the powers-that-be.",
      "Longer term, though, the boost may not be so powerful.  The truth is that Marine Le Pen is a huge asset to the RN.  This battle-hardened, sentimental, cat-loving,  tough-talking,  long-suffering woman is held in affection by her supporters, who feel they know her personally.",
      "Jordan Bardella is a popular figure too, but at just 29 it is hard to see him filling her shoes. If Marine Le Pen is indeed unable to run in 2027, the RN loses much of its appeal.",
      "What is certain is that many would-be candidates on the non-RN right \u2013 Laurent Wauquiez, Bruno Retailleau for example \u2013 would see in a Bardella candidacy a big opportunity for themselves.",
      "The other unknown is vengeance.",
      "Marine Le Pen remains a member of the National Assembly, where she leads a bloc of 125 \u2013 the parliament's biggest.  Till now she had been benign towards the beleaguered prime minister Francois Bayrou, who struggles on despite having no majority.",

      "Even though the south-east Asian nation is a high risk region for earthquakes, neighbouring Thailand and China - which were also affected by the quake - are not.",
      "The Thai capital, Bangkok, sits more than 1,000km (621 miles) from the epicentre of Friday's earthquake - and yet an unfinished high-rise building in the city was felled by it.",
      "Here we will explain what caused this earthquake, and how it was able to have such a powerful effect so far away.",
      "Follow updates on this story",
      "Follow updates on this story",
      "What caused the earthquake?",
      "The earth's upper layer is split into different sections, called tectonic plates, which are all moving constantly. Some move alongside each other, whilst others are above and below each other.",
      "It is this movement that causes earthquakes and volcanoes.",
      "Myanmar is considered to be one of the most geologically \"active\" areas in the world because it sits on top of the convergence of four of these tectonic plates - the Eurasian plate, the Indian plate, the Sunda plate and the Burma microplate.",
      "The Himalayas were formed by the Indian plate colliding with the Eurasian plate, and the 2004 Tsunami as a result of the Indian plate moving beneath the Burma microplate.",
      "Dr Rebecca Bell, a reader in tectonics at Imperial College London, said that to accommodate all of this motion, faults - cracks in the rock - form which allow tectonic plates to \"slither\" sideways.",
      "There is a major fault called the Sagaing fault, which cuts right through Myanmar north to south and is more than 1,200km (746 miles) long.",
      "Early data suggests that the movement that caused Friday's 7.7-magnitude earthquake was a \"strike-slip\" - where two blocks move horizontally along each other.",
      "This aligns with the movement typical of the Sagaing fault.",
      "As the plates move past each other, they can become stuck, building friction until it is suddenly released and the earth shifts, causing an earthquake.",
      "Why was the earthquake felt so far away?",
      "Earthquakes can happen at up to 700km (435 miles) below the surface. This one was just 10km from the surface, making it very shallow. This increases the amount of shaking at the surface.",
      "The earthquake was also very large - measuring 7.7 on the moment scale. It produced more energy than the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima, according to the US Geological Survey.",
      "The size of the quake was because of the type of fault, said Dr Bell.",
      "\"The straight nature [of the fault] means earthquakes can rupture over large areas - and the larger the area of the fault that slips, the larger the earthquake,\" she explained.",
      "\"There have been six magnitude 7 or greater earthquakes in this region in the last century.\"",
      "This straight fault also means a lot of the energy can be carried down its length - which extends for 1,200km south towards Thailand.",
      "When it comes to why the earth shook so much, scientists believe it is because the quake was a rare \"super shear\" - meaning energy from the rupture in the earth's crust built up because it was moving faster than seismic waves can travel through the earth.",
      "Seismologist Prof Frederik Tilmann, from the Helmholtz Centre for Geosciences in Germany, explained in analysis shared online that the rupture travelled at a speed of about 5km per second - making it \"the earthquake equivalent of a supersonic jet\".",
      "Because the fracture \"unzipped\" towards the south, it also directed this piled up energy towards the Thai capital, Bangkok, and this is why the earthquake had such an impact so far away.",
      "How earthquakes are felt at the surface is also determined by the type of soil.",
      "In soft soil - which is what Bangkok is built on - seismic waves (the vibrations of the earth) slow down and build up, getting bigger in size.",
      "So, Bangkok's geology would have made the ground shaking more intense.",
      "Why did just one skyscraper collapse in Bangkok?",
      "While dramatic footage has emerged of high-rise buildings in Bangkok swaying during the quake - knocking water from rooftop pools - the unfinished headquarters for the auditor-general's office Bangkok's Chatuchak district appears to be the only skyscraper to collapse.",
      "Prior to 2009, Bangkok did not have a comprehensive safety standard for constructing buildings to withstand earthquakes, according to Dr Christian M\u00e1laga-Chuquitaype, a senior lecturer in earthquake engineering at Imperial College London.",
      "This means that older buildings would have been particularly vulnerable.",
      "This is not unusual, as earthquake-resistant buildings can be more expensive to construct and Thailand, unlike Myanmar, does not frequently experience earthquakes.",
      "Dr Emily So, a professor of architectural engineering at the University of Cambridge, noted that older buildings can and have been strengthened, such as in California, western Canada and New Zealand.",
      "Prof Amorn Pimarnmas, president of the Structural Engineers Association of Thailand, said that while there were regulations in 43 provinces on earthquake-proofing buildings, less than 10% of buildings are estimated to be quake-resistant.",
      "Yet the building that collapsed was new - in fact, it was still under construction when the earthquake hit - and the updated building standards would have applied.",
      "Dr Pimarnmas said Bangkok's soft soil may have also played a part in its collapse, as it can amplify ground motions three or four times over.",
      "He added: \"However, there are other assumptions such as material (concrete and reinforcements) quality and some irregularity in [the] structural system. These remain to be investigated in detail.\"",
      "Having studied the video, Dr M\u00e1laga-Chuquitaype said it appears a \"flat slab\" construction process was being favoured - which is no longer recommended in earthquake-prone areas.",
      "\"A 'flat slab' system is a way of constructing buildings where floors are made to rest directly on columns, without using beams,\" he explained.",
      "\"Imagine a table supported only by legs, with no extra horizontal supports underneath.",
      "\"While this design has cost and architectural advantages, is performs poorly during earthquakes, often failing in a brittle and sudden (almost explosive) manner.\"",

      "Mandalay in Myanmar was much closer to where the ground slipped and would have experienced significantly more severe shaking than Bangkok.",
      "Although Myanmar regularly experiences earthquakes, Dr Ian Watkinson, a lecturer in earth sciences at Royal Holloway University, thought it was unlikely that many buildings were constructed to be earthquake-proof.",
      "\"General poverty, major political upheaval, alongside other disasters - e.g. the Indian Ocean tsunami in 2004 - has distracted the country from concentrating on the unpredictable risks from earthquakes,\" he said.",
      "\"This means that, in many cases, building design codes are not enforced, and construction happens in areas that could be prone to enhanced seismic risk, for example flood plains and steep slopes.\"",
      "Parts of Mandalay and its buildings also lie along the floodplain of the Ayerwaddy River. This makes them very vulnerable to a process called liquefaction.",
      "This happens when the soil has a high water content, and the shaking causes the sediment to lose its strength and behave like a liquid. This increases the risk of landslides and building collapses, as the ground can no longer hold them up.",
      "Dr So warned that there was \"always a chance\" of further damage to buildings near a fault line due to aftershocks - tremors that follow an earthquake, which can be caused by the sudden transfer of energy into nearby rock.",

      "But the \"turn\" that Germany started in 2022 gained fresh momentum this year.",
      "A recent YouGov poll showed that 79% of Germans still see Vladimir Putin as \"very\" or \"quite\" dangerous to European peace and security.",
      "Now 74% said the same for Donald Trump.",
      "The survey followed a speech in Munich in which his Vice President JD Vance laid into Europe and its values.",

      "Eighteen-year-old Charlotte Kreft says her own pacifist views have changed.",
      "\"For a really long time, we thought the only way to make up for the atrocities we committed in World War Two was to make sure it never happened again [\u2026] and we thought we needed to demilitarise,\" Charlotte explains.",
      "\"But now we are in a situation where we have to fight for our values and democracy and freedom. We need to adapt.\"",
      "\"There are lots of Germans who still feel strange about big investments in our military,\" Ludwig Stein agrees. \"But I think considering the things that have happened in the past few years, there's no other real option.\"",
      "Sophie, a young mum, thinks investing in defence is now \"necessary in the world we live in\".",
      "But Germany needs troops as well as tanks, and she's far less keen on her own son being enlisted.",
      "'Are you ready for war?'",
      "The Bundeswehr only has one permanent drop-in centre, a small unit sandwiched between a pharmacy and a shoe store beside Berlin's Friedrichstrasse station.",
      "With camouflage-clad dummies in the window and slogans like \"cool and spicy\" it aims to attract men and women to serve, but only gets a handful of callers each day.",
      "Germany has already missed a target of boosting its ranks by 20,000 soldiers, to 203,000, and lowering the average age from 34.",
      "But Gen Breuer's ambitions are far greater.",
      "He told us Germany needs an extra 100,000 troops to defend itself and Nato's eastern flank adequately - a total of 460,000, including reserves. So he insists a return to military service is \"absolutely\" necessary.",
      "\"You won't get this 100,000 without one or other model of conscription,\" the general said.",
      "\"We don't have to determine now what model brings them. For me it's only important that we get the soldiers in.\"",
      "That debate has only just begun.",
      "General Breuer is clearly positioning himself at the front of an effort to push Germany's \"turn\" further and faster.",
      "With his easy, engaging manner, he likes to visit regional town halls and challenge audiences there with a question: \"Are you ready for war?\"",
      "One day a woman accused him of scaring her. \"I said, 'It's not me scaring you, it's the other guy!'\" he remembers his reply.",
      "He was referring to Vladimir Putin.",
      "The twin \"wake-up\" alarm \u2013 of the Russia threat and an isolationist, disengaged United States \u2013 is now ringing loudly for Germany, the general argues, and can't be ignored.",
      "\"Now it's understandable to each and every one of us that we have to change.\""

    "story": [
      "President Trump is taking center stage at the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington, D.C. \"We are going to make a lot of changes,\" he said earlier this month, \"including the seats, the decor, pretty much everything. It needs a lot of work.\"",
      "He's directing many of those changes as the new chairman of the board. Out are all of President Joe Biden's appointees, replaced with Trump allies.",
      "The Trump White House says an overhaul is needed because the marquee arts center is, in their words, \"woke \u2026 and broke.\"",
      "Last month, Deborah Rutter was fired as president of the Kennedy Center after serving for more than a decade. Asked whether the arts institution is broke, Rutter replied, \"The Kennedy Center has the most complicated financial model, and that is true of every nonprofit arts organization.\"",
      "It has a budget of $268 million, with $43 million coming from the federal government. In 2023, the Kennedy Center had a $6 million surplus, even though it is not supposed to be a money-making enterprise. \"We're a nonprofit organization,\" Rutter said. \"It's not intended to make money.\"",
      "Its budget comes mostly from donations. Billionaire businessman and former chairman David Rubenstein has given more than $100 million. He, too, was fired last month. Rutter said, \"To have us both leaving at the same time does cause me some worry, because of the sense of understanding of structure, decision-making, how we go about interpreting our mission, all of those kinds of things.\"",
      "The Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts was founded in 1971 as a national cultural center and memorial to President John F. Kennedy. Its annual honors ceremony, which airs on CBS, features the best in music, theater and dance.",
      "But now, conservatives charge the center is \"too liberal,\" highlighting three drag events last year, including a \"Broadway Drag Brunch.\"",
      "Asked whether it was a mistake to host drag shows, Rutter replied, \"I don't think so. I believe that everybody in America has the opportunity to be seen, and to be seen at your national cultural center.\"",
      "She pointed out that the shows Trump referred to in a social media post (\"THIS WILL STOP,\" he promised) represented just three of the 2,000 performances that took place at the Kennedy Center last year.",
      "Asked why the focus was on three drag shows, Rutter replied, \"I can't actually imagine. Drag has been around for centuries. Shakespeare performed in drag, the original Shakespeare.\"",
      "President Trump boycotted the Kennedy Center Honors during his first term, after criticism from honorees like Norman Lear. So, what does the new chairman have planned now? In audio obtained by \"CBS Sunday Morning,\" he suggests a new host \u2013 himself:",
      "\"The king of ratings, right? Whether we like it or not, the king of ratings! So, if I was the host of the Honors, and we'll go slightly more conservative, if you don't mind, with some of the people\u2026\"",
      "So, what kind of people does President Trump want to honor? Paolo Zampolli, a longtime friend of the president who has been on the board since 2020, said, \"There were mentioned a list of people, I remember the name of Pavarotti. I remember the name of Andrea Bocelli. They wanted to do something about Elvis Presley.\"",
      "Zampolli has suggested changes to make the Kennedy Center \"better\": \"We're on the Potomac River. We could have a little marina where in the weekend boats can come, and nice cafes, nice location where they can spend the weekend there and make it like a destination. Other things that I suggested is branch franchises around the world.\"",
      "Another idea? Sending art to the International Space Station. \"My idea was to have, not Michelangelo, not Picasso, but you know, living contemporary artists to create very small pieces of art,\" Zampolli said, \"One that can be displayed inside the ISS. One can be thrown in LEO, low orbit, that can circulate in the orbit. And one can be auctioned on the ground of the Kennedy Center, because they need to raise money.\"",
      "Some artists (including those who are LGBTQ) have expressed the belief that they won't be welcome at the Kennedy Center. But Zampolli said, \"I don't think the president have anything against these kind of people. I don't understand what is things 'inclusion' or this 'woke.' The Kennedy Center is accessible for everybody, and has to represent the agenda of America.\"",
      "Not everyone agrees. One thing you won't see at the Center is the musical \"Hamilton.\" Producers cancelled shows after President Trump became chairman. The president's response? \"I never liked 'Hamilton' very much. I never liked it.\"",

      "Asked whether there was any political involvement then, Folds replied, \"Never saw anything like this. This is new, and it was quite sudden. Let's say I get in an artist that has different views than the president. Do they feel safe being themselves? Do they feel safe saying what they believe? They're not political shows, but you can express what you'd like to.\"",
      "And is that no longer the case? \"Well, I suspect it's no longer the case,\" Folds said. \"There is an instinct, an authoritarian instinct, that is true in all authoritarian times in history: Take control of the culture, take control of the arts early on.\"",

Young Brandi collected everything about him she could get her hands on \u2013 records, photos, even an Elton John book she borrowed from a library 33 years ago, and kept(!). \"The date is still on here. Boulevard Park Library, May 10, 1992. It's all time stamped. And they're gonna have to come and get it!\"",
      "Little Brandi is now music superstar Brandi Carlile, but to a young girl coming of age and struggling with her own sexuality, Elton John was a flicker of hope in a confusing world. She loved him, and said so in writing, covering an entire page front to back with \"I love Elton John.\" \"It's insane,\" she said. \"I look at it now. I just can't believe what happened in my life to get me to where I am now. It's such a strange thing. It makes you wonder, it just makes you wonder. I do love Elton John!\"",
      "As a kid, she never dreamed she'd get to actually meet him one day, but sometimes dreams have a funny way of coming true. Now they're not only friends, but collaborators. It started a few years back when Carlile wrote to John out of the blue, and asked him to play piano on her new record.\u00a0 Long story short, he said yes, and they grew to be the best of friends \u2013 appearing together, performing together, even vacationing together with their families.",
      "And now, they're about to release an album they made together, recorded at Sunset Sound in Hollywood. It's Brandi Carlile's eighth studio album, and Elton John's 33rd.",
      "So, why did they decide to do an entire album together? John said, \"She's someone I wanted to work with for so long because I know how great she is. I know how her voice is, and I knew what she's capable of, and I wanted to push her more. And I wanted her to push me more. So, I wanted to make a record that was full of energy and great songs. And it turned out really brilliantly.\"",
      "There were cameras in the studio to capture all the highs, and a few of the lows. \"I didn't even think of them being there,\" John said.",
      "\"Yeah, I never saw one,\" Carlile said.",
      "It got tense at times (John admits, \"I haven't really seen the footage, but a lotta people say it's really, really very moving. And all of my behavior is not so moving!\"), but for Brandi, it was still the greatest show on Earth. \"It really felt like I was watching Mozart or, like, one of the great composers,\" she said. \"Stream of consciousness through their entire body, create music in a way that I've never seen. And I was so close. I had a front-row seat.\"",
      "John called it \"one of the greatest musical experiences of my life.\"",
      "Elton John and Brandi Carlile perform \"Swing For The Fences\":",
      "The fact that John got through the recording process at all is remarkable. For the past year, he's been fighting a severe eye infection that's left him nearly blind. But he says that, all things considered, he's doing all right. \"Medically, I'm fit as I've ever been,\" he said. \"I have checkups every month. But the eyesight thing is a bit of a bind, because I haven't been able to watch anything for about seven months. I haven't been able to read. I haven't been able to watch television or anything.",
      "\"But you know what? I've come to the conclusion that if we can't find a solution to it, and this is what it's like for the rest of my life, then I'm okay,\" he said. \"I can still play the piano. I can still sing, which is a gift. My life's fantastic. It's still the greatest gift that anyone could have.\"",
      "These days, John, who turned 78 this past week, is counting his blessings. But the final track on the album really struck a nerve: \"When This Old World Is Done With Me,\" co-written by longtime collaborator Bernie Taupin.",
      "He got very emotional in the studio while recording it: \"Well, I started singing, and I thought the verse was really beautiful. But then I had no idea what was coming. And when I got to the chorus, I realized what was coming, and I just broke down. And I sobbed, and I sobbed, and I sobbed, because it's about my death, basically. And when you get to my age, and a certain age, you think about mortality, because I wanna spend so much time with my children and David and my friends, that you want every single moment to count. And so, this was a song about I don't want to die. I wanna be with my children. I wanna be with David forever. And so, it really got to me.\"",
      "David is husband David Furnish. The two were married in 2014. They have two sons, Zachary and Elijah.",
      "Dad might be a global superstar, but there's no doubt where his heart is. Asked what he is most proud of, John replied, \"Yeah, my kids. My husband. That's it. All I want on my gravestone is, 'He was a great dad.' Nothing to do with music. 'He was a great dad.' That's all I care about.\"",
      "Their new album will be released this week, and for Carlile, it's still a little hard to believe: \"Yeah, it's so weird. Is it not? It's brilliant. Like, it's a wonderful thing. I hope everybody can take some hope and beauty and mysticism from the fact that this has happened. If it could happen to 11-year-old single-wide mobile home Brandi Carlile, it could really happen to anyone.\"",
      "Turns out these two friends don't just lean on each other; they push each other to new heights. The title track of their album is \"Who Believes In Angels?\" But maybe Elton John and Brandi Carlile are angels for each other.",
      "Elton John and Brandi Carlile perform \"Who Believes In Angels?\":",
      "John said, \"God, it was a challenge. But that's what life's all about. If you don't have a challenge at 76, then never give up. Never coast. There are so many artists that coast that don't make new songs. They just go around and play their hits, like I did. I didn't wanna do it with this record. I wanted a new start. I want a fresh start.",

    "published": "Fri, 28 Mar 2025 12:26:00 -0400",
    "summary": "President Trump signed an executive order targeting funding for Smithsonian Institution programs that he says contain \"divisive, race-centered ideology.\"",
    "story": [
      "President Trump on Thursday signed an\u00a0executive order\u00a0targeting funding for programs at the\u00a0Smithsonian Institution\u00a0that contain what he characterizes as \"divisive, race-centered ideology\" in his latest broadside against a liberalism that has critiqued Western culture and values.",
      "The president said in the order that there has been a \"concerted and widespread\" effort over the past decade to rewrite American history by replacing \"objective facts\" with a \"distorted narrative driven by ideology rather than truth.\" He said this narrative has cast the \"founding principles\" of the U.S. in a \"negative light.\"",
      "\"The Smithsonian Institution has, in recent years, come under the influence of a divisive, race-centered ideology,\" Mr. Trump said in the order. \"This shift has promoted narratives that portray American and Western values as inherently harmful and oppressive.\" He pointed to a sculpture exhibit at the Smithsonian American Art Museum representing that \"[s]ocieties including the United States have used race to establish and maintain systems of power, privilege, and disenfranchisement.\"",
      "The order tasks Vice President JD Vance, who serves on the Smithsonian Institution's Board of Regents, with overseeing efforts to \"remove improper ideology\" from all areas of the institution, including its museums, education and research centers and the National Zoo.",
      "It marks Mr. Trump's latest salvo against cultural pillars of society, such as universities and art, that he sees as out of step with conservative sensibilities. He recently had himself installed as chairman of the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts with the aim of overhauling programming, including the annual Kennedy Center Honors awards show. The administration also recently forced Columbia University to make a series of policy changes by threatening the Ivy League school with the loss of several hundred million dollars in federal funding.",
      "The executive order also hints at the return of statues and monuments of Confederate figures, many of which were taken down or replaced around the country after the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis in 2020 and the rise of the Black Lives Matter movement, which is detested by Trump and other conservatives.",
      "The president directed the secretary of the interior to determine whether, since Jan. 1, 2020, \"public monuments, memorials, statues, markers, or similar properties within the Department of the Interior's jurisdiction have been removed or changed to perpetuate a false reconstruction of American history, inappropriately minimize the value of certain historical events or figures, or include any other improper partisan ideology.\"",
      "The order also calls for improvements to Independence Hall in Philadelphia by July 4, 2026, in time for the 250th anniversary of the signing of the Declaration of Independence.",
      "Mr. Trump singled out the National Museum of African American History and Culture, which opened in 2016 near the White House, the Women's History Museum, which is in development, and the American Art Museum for criticism.",
      "\"Museums in our Nation's capital should be places where individuals go to learn \u2014 not to be subjected to ideological indoctrination or divisive narratives that distort our shared history,\" he said in the order.",
      "Linda St. Thomas, the Smithsonian Institution's chief spokesperson, said in an email late Thursday, \"We have no comment for now.\"",
      "Under the order, Vance is to work with the White House budget office to make sure future funding for the Smithsonian Institution isn't spent on programs that \"degrade shared American values, divide Americans based on race, or promote programs or ideologies inconsistent with federal law and policy.\" The president also wants to ensure that the women's history museum celebrates women and not \"recognize men as women in any respect.\"",
      "The Smithsonian Institution is the world's largest museum, education and research complex. It consists of 21 museums and the National Zoo. Eleven museums are located along the National Mall in Washington.",
      "The institution was established by Congress with money from James Smithson, a British scientist who left his estate to the United States to found \"at Washington, under the name of the Smithsonian Institution, an establishment for the increase and diffusion of knowledge.\"",

      "The 2025 iteration of the Pistols \u2014 original guitarist Steve Jones, drummer Paul Cook and bassist Glen Matlock joined by frontman Frank Carter (of Gallows, Pure Love and Frank Carter and the Rattlesnakes) \u2014 will hit the road on Sept. 16 at a very memorable stage: The Longhorn Ballroom in Dallas, Texas. It was the site of a particularly hostile show for the band when it first toured the U.S. in 1978.",
      "Jones told The Associated Press he recalls having \"pigs' hooves and bottles and whatnot slung at us by cowboys.\"",
      "It is one of a few dates featured in three \"Live in the U.S.A.\" albums, documenting the band's '78 run: Atlanta, Dallas and San Francisco. The latter will be released on April 25 and captures the show where the band originally called it quits.",
      "\"We were thinking of breaking up in San Francisco again,\" Jones joked.",
      "The 2025 tour is currently scheduled to conclude Oct. 16 at the Hollywood Palladium in Los Angeles.

      "So, why tour the U.S. and Canada now?",
      "\"Why not?\" Jones said.",
      "\"I think everybody needs this band right now. I think the world needs this band right now,\" Carter said. \"And I think definitely America is screaming out for a band like the Sex Pistols.\"",
      "\"At the end of the day, we're living in a really, really difficult time. So not only do people want to come and just be entertained, they want to enjoy themselves,\" he continued. \"Punk is an energetic music. It's one where you can go and vent and let your hair down, hopefully in a safe manner. Fingers crossed, no bottles or pigs' hooves.\"",
      "Carter fronted the Sex Pistols last year for a few U.K. dates. The band said they did not reach out to Lydon to see if he wanted to participate in this reunion tour.",
      "\"The last thing he wants to do is have anything to do with us right now,\" Jones said, referring to a previous lawsuit between the singer and the band over music use in\u00a0their TV series \"Pistol.\"\u00a0The judge ruled against Lydon's opposition.",
      "\"We wish him the best,\" Jones said.",
      "\"Good luck to him,\" Matlock added. \"I wish he thinks, maybe, 'good luck' to us. Probably doesn't. But over the years, John (has had) all our phone numbers, and I can't see many missed calls from him.\"",
      "As for the 2025 tour: Fans shouldn't expect the violence of their 1978 run, but they should anticipate a tighter performance.",
      "\"We're a bit older but we play just as well, if not better,\" Matlock said. \"And I think that's something that's got a great deal of aplomb that we're going to bring to the public over there.\"",
      "Does this mean there could be new Sex Pistols music in the future? \"It's early days,\" Jones said. \"Let's see what happens.\"",

      "\"Colorado is thrilled to welcome the Sundance Film Festival to its new home in Boulder starting in 2027,\" Colorado Gov. Jared Polis said in a statement. \"Here in our state we celebrate the arts and film industry as a key economic driver, job creator, and important contributor to our thriving culture. Now, with the addition of the iconic Sundance Film Festival, we can expect even more jobs, a huge benefit for our small businesses including stores and restaurants.\"",
      "\"This decision was informed by a detailed evaluation of the key components essential to creating our Festival. During the process, it became clear that Boulder is the ideal location in which to build our Festival's future, marking a key strategic step in its natural evolution,\" Sundance Institute Board Chair  Ebs Burnough said.",
      "The Sundance Film Festival takes place every January. The Boulder Film Festival will likely be pushed back by about a month, officials behind that festival previously told CBS News Colorado.",
      "Utah was home to the international film festival for 42 years, but festival organizers said the festival has outgrown its home.",
      "Since entering the selection process, state and local leaders in Colorado have mounted considerable efforts to get the festival moved to Boulder, citing the city's concentration of artists, its history of culture, and the revenue benefits to the city and state.",
      "\"I founded the Sundance Institute with a commitment to discovering and developing independent artists, with the Sundance Film Festival serving as the platform for stories to help expand audiences and broaden the landscape,\" Robert Redford, Sundance Institute president and founder, said in a statement. \"This move will ensure that the Festival continues its work of risk taking, supporting innovative storytellers, fostering independence, and entertaining and enlightening audiences. I am grateful to the Boulder community for its support, and I look forward to seeing what the future holds for the Festival there.\"",
      "As part of Boulder's efforts to attract Sundance, the state legislature is considering up to $34 million in refundable tax credits, which would kick in by 2027, when Sundance is set to relocate here. Some state lawmakers oppose that move, however, with one saying it was unfair to ask the entire state to subsidize what would largely only benefit one community.",
      "Nonetheless, the efforts didn't stop there. City leaders in Boulder previously said that local hotels have already committed to capping room price increases during the 11-day event.",
      "\"Our walkable downtown, iconic venues, and beautiful landscape at the base of the Rocky Mountains sets the stage for the Sundance Film Festival to flourish in its next chapter,\" said Charlene Hoffman, CEO of Visit Boulder. \"It's been a remarkable experience getting to share our vibrant community with the Sundance Institute and we eagerly await the Festival's debut in beautiful Boulder, Colorado with excitement and gratitude.\"",
      "A study by the State of Utah found Sundance had nearly 73,000 attendees in 2024, generating $132 million in economic output, $14 million in tax revenue, and $70 million in wages.",
      "\"Boulder is an art town, tech town, mountain town, and college town. It is a place where the Festival can build and flourish. This is the beginning of a bold, new journey as we invite everyone to be part of our community and to be entertained and inspired,\" the Sundance Institute's acting CEO Amanda Kelso said. \"We can't imagine a better fit than Boulder.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 01 Apr 2025 20:13:00 -0400",
    "summary": "President Trump is expected on April 2 to announce reciprocal tariffs on a number of other countries. Here's what to know about these import taxes.",
    "story": [
      "A core element of the protectionist trade policies President Trump is scheduled to announce on Wednesday \u2014 a planned import tax blitz he has referred to as \"Liberation Day\" \u2014 are so-called reciprocal tariffs. Mr. Trump has touted such levies as a way to level the playing field with other countries that impose higher tariffs on U.S. imports, as well as to boost domestic manufacturers.",
      "But some economists say that tit-for-tat tariffs with key trading partners could be hard to structure, while also roiling global commerce and driving up costs\u00a0for U.S. consumers and businesses. Here's what to know about reciprocal tariffs.",
      "What are reciprocal tariffs?",
      "Truly reciprocal tariffs would impose the same tax on U.S. imports that other countries charge on American exports on a product by product basis. For example, if a country imposed a 6% levy on American-made shoes, Mr. Trump would tax that nation's footwear at the same rate.",
      "Currently, the U.S. and its trading partners charge each other different levies on the same products. Germany, for instance, puts higher tariffs on vehicles made in the U.S. than what Washington, D.C., charges on German vehicle imports.",
      "\"Reciprocal means that if a country has higher tariffs than we do on certain products, we would raise it to that level,\" Alex Jacquez, chief of policy and advocacy at Groundwork Collaborative, a left-leaning public policy think tank, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "That would be administratively complex given the tens of thousands of codes that determine the tariff rates on a variety of products.",
      "\"Setting up reciprocal tariffs across every product category with every trade partner would be completely infeasible with our administrative capacity,\" Jacquez said.",
      "Are reciprocal tariffs the same as country-based tariffs?",
      "Rather than impose perfectly reciprocal tariffs, the White House could instead announce country-specific tariff rates calibrated to the their trade imbalance with the U.S.",
      "\"They will probably come up with a blended rate that is not reciprocal by product, but is reciprocal by saying their tariffs are 10% higher than ours on average, so we'll be imposing 10% tariff across-the-board on all goods,\" said Jacquez, who formerly worked as an economic policy analyst in the Biden administration.",
      "That approach could result in the U.S. taxing other nations' products at vastly different rate than they do ours.",
      "\"It will hit a lot of products very differently in a proximate way, because it would be balanced by country but not by import or export,\" Jacquez said. \"That is where complications will arise, and you could see a scenario in which countries retaliate against us.\"",
      "Who are the \"Dirty 15\"?",
      "Trump administration officials have singled out a group of nations they dubbed the \"Dirty 15,\"\u00a0 a reference to the 15% of countries expected to be hit hardest by the new reciprocal tariffs given their trade surplus with the U.S.",
      "Those nations account for \"a huge amount of our trading volume,\" U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told Fox News' Maria Bartiromo on March 18, without naming the trade partners.",
      "National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett also told Fox News that the White House is targeting 10 to 15 nations with the biggest trade surplus with the U.S. Like Bessent, he also refrained from naming those nations.",
      "In 2024, the largest U.S. trade deficits around the globe \u2014 meaning countries from which the U.S. imports more than it exports \u2014 was with the following nations, according to federal data:",

      "Austria ($13.1 billion)",
      "Sweden ($9.8 billion)",
      "Are reciprocal prices likely to drive up consumer prices?",
      "Experts say reciprocal tariffs would mean added costs for U.S. businesses, which in turn would likely raise consumer prices in order to protect their profit margins.",
      "\"Tariffs are a tax on a business bringing a product into the country. When they receive it at a port of entry, whether it be an airport or seaport, they have to pay the duty to have it admitted into the country,\" Chris Barrett, a professor at Cornell SC Johnson School of Business, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"You've just added a cost on for the business, and those costs get passed on, at least to some degree, to consumers.\"",
      "How much prices could rise remains unclear. Meanwhile, prices could fall if Mr. Trump later lowers or removes reciprocal tariffs following trade negotiations.",
      "But when there is no good substitute for a particular good, consumer costs are likely to rise more sharply.",
      "\"The more price insensitive they are, the more likely they are to shoulder the burden of the tax,\" Barrett said.",

      "Retail sales \u2014 or direct-to-consumer-sales \u2014 rose 5% in the first quarter, driven by a 19% surge during the month of March, the Michigan-based automaker reported. The company did not state outright that the bump was related to Trump's upcoming tariff announcement.",
      "Burlington, Vermont-based artist Val Hird is among the consumers who rushed to lock in a deal on her vehicle of choice before April 2, which Mr. Trump has referred to as \"Liberation Day.\"",
      "A day before Mr. Trump announced plans to impose 25% tariffs on vehicles on auto parts imported into the U.S., Hird had decided to purchase a vehicle, she told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Hird said she had wanted a Toyota RAV4 Plug-in hybrid, but her local Toyota dealer did not have the car in stock. \"I would have ordered one, except we just found out there are going to be tariffs. So, we assumed if it's not yet in the country, or in transit to the country, that would probably throw it into the 'who knows what the price will be' category,\" she said of her reluctance to place an order on a new car.",
      "Instead, Hird located a used version of her preferred car model at another dealership in Rhode Island, which she \"leapt to the phone\" to buy.",
      "She ultimately paid $45,453 for the pre-owned Toyota hybrid. Had that particular model not been available, Hird said she would have forewent the purchase of a car altogether and waited to see how the trade war progressed.",
      "\"I don't live in a world where I can spend an extra $10,000,\" Hird said of the anticipated tariff-related price hikes on cars.",
      "Tariff talk at dealerships grows",
      "Analysts say that tariffs are top of mind for consumers, with dealers saying consumers are increasingly weaving talk of the levies into their car-buying conversations.",
      "Data from Cox Automotive, which owns several popular car insight sites, including Kelley Blue Book, Autotrader and Dealer.com, shows a dramatic uptick in car shopping activity in recent days. There was a 27% uptick in visits to Kelly Blue Book Thursday after Mr. Trump announced 25% auto tariffs.",
      "On Friday, users logged 54% more new car leads on Dealer.com, meaning they submitted inquiries to dealers about vehicles they were interested in buying. Auto Trader notched an uptick of 16% in used car leads.",
      "\"It makes a lot of sense; I would assume that people would have gotten started researching to see what things look like now,\" Erin Keating, executive analyst at Cox Automotive, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "More pressure on cost-conscious to buy now",
      "Car prices are all but guaranteed to rise when tariffs go into effect. By contrast, vehicles currently sitting on dealers' lots are insulated from the levies.",
      "\"If consumers are seeing prices on lots saying, 'here's the tariff adjustment cost,' they should challenge that, because sitting inventory is not subject to tariffs,\" Aaron Bragman, Detroit bureau chief of Cars.com, a car buying marketplace, told CBS MoneyWatch. He noted that existing inventory is relatively stable. \"There are vehicles to be had, we aren't seeing an inventory crunch right now.\"",
      "Indeed, McCabe said dealers are seeing increased interest in vehicles on lots from consumers, and \"are going to be more picky on their consumers to get the best price they can.\"",
      "Said McCabe, \"They know the supply and demand issue will change pretty quickly with the tariff impact.\"",
      "That's why his advice to consumers who need a new car is to start shopping now. \"If you need car and can afford it, get out there now,\" he said.",
      "In particular, motorists on the lower end of the income scale should consider making their car purchases immediately, he said, because any kind of price hike could push them out of the market for a vehicle altogether.",
      "\"There's a cost-conscious consumer that if you start tariffing them, they'll stop buying the vehicle because it doesn't fit in their budget,\" McCabe said.",

    "published": "Tue, 01 Apr 2025 13:40:17 -0400",
    "summary": "Here's what to know about tariffs ahead of President Trump's plans to announce new import duties on April 2.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration is planning to impose a round of fresh tariffs on April 2, a day President Trump has dubbed \"Liberation Day.\" The announcement is viewed by economists as the culmination of his \"America First Trade Policy,\" an\u00a0executive order he signed on his first day in office aimed at revitalizing U.S. manufacturing.",
      "Mr. Trump has referred to his April 2 tariff announcement as \"the big one,\" suggesting that the plans may be more far reaching than the import levies he's already unleashed on goods from other nations, such as his March 26 declaration of 25% tariffs on vehicles and auto parts imported into the\u00a0U.S.",
      "\"For DECADES we have been ripped off and abused by every nation in the World, both friend and foe. Now it is finally time for the Good Ol' USA to get some of that MONEY, and RESPECT, BACK. GOD BLESS AMERICA!!!\" Trump said about his April 2 plans in a post\u00a0earlier this month on Truth Social.",
      "On April 2, Mr. Trump will announce his administration's plans for so-called reciprocal tariffs, at an event in the White House Rose Garden, the White House said. He deems the levies necessary to erase trade imbalances with nations that export more goods to the U.S. than they import from America. But the addition of broad-based tariffs to a host of imports is likely to heat up a global trade war that could, at least in the short term, boost prices for U.S. consumers and juice inflation.",
      "\"Tariffs are a tax on imported goods, and research shows that that majority gets passed along to consumers,\" Colin Grabow, associate director of the Herbert A. Stiefel Center for trade policy studies at the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Ultimately, the Trump administration's goal is to increase prices on imports to the point where it's economically favorable for companies to relocate their manufacturing to the U.S., he noted.",
      "\"If prices don't go up, it doesn't deter imports, and therefore there is no reason to set up shop in the U.S.,\" Grabow explained. \"Part of the logic is premised on prices going up, otherwise they are not going to accomplish their goal.\"",
      "Economists say that Mr. Trump's tariff agenda, including the uncertainty surrounding it, could drag down U.S. GDP by depressing financial markets and consumer sentiment.",
      "\"The main channel from trade policy uncertainty to GDP is via business investment. Under higher trade policy uncertainty, future revenue streams of an investment become more uncertain, raising the option value of delaying investment decisions until the situation is clearer,\" Oxford Economics analysts said in a research note.",
      "What tariffs will Trump announce April 2?",
      "Mr. Trump teased his April 2 announcement last week when he announced his new 25% tariffs on foreign-made cars and auto parts. \"That's Liberation Day, that's gonna be on the 2nd, and that's gonna be reciprocal, and I think people will be impressed,\" the president said.",
      "Reciprocal tariffs are designed to match the import duties placed on U.S. goods and services by other nations, as well as compensate for other trade barriers, according to the Yale Budget Lab, a non-partisan public policy think tank. According to a White House memo from Feb. 13, the U.S. faces additional trade barriers aside from tariffs such as regulatory requirements that can make it more difficult for American exports to reach other nations.",
      "While the size and scope of the reciprocal tariffs that Mr. Trump plans to announce are still unknown, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent previously said the administration's reciprocal tariffs would target countries with the biggest trade surpluses, as well as those which have imposed the highest tariffs plus non-tariff trade barriers on U.S. goods.",
      "Multiple nations run large annual trade surpluses with the U.S., including Germany, Ireland and Italy in the European Union, as well as Vietnam, Japan and Taiwan. The U.S. also has a large trade deficit with China, although Mr. Trump has already imposed new tariffs on that nation.",
      "\"It'll be in many cases less than the tariff that they've been charging us for decades ... I think we're trying to keep it somewhat conservative,\" Mr. Trump said on March 26.",
      "Mr. Trump added that he'll introduce a reciprocal tariff policy on \"all countries,\" which he said would be \"very lenient.\"",
      "On Sunday, National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett told Fox News' Maria Bartiromo that there are 15 countries \"that we have massive, massive trade deficits with,\" but that Mr. Trump will ultimately decided how many countries will be subject to new tariffs Wednesday.",
      "Mr. Hassett also promoted tariffs as an effective tool for reshoring manufacturing to the U.S., saying \"it's going to be a boom,\" referring to auto manufacturing in particular.",
      "Meanwhile, additional tariffs are also slated to go into effect on April 2, with Mr. Trump's one-month delay on 25% tariffs on Canadian and Mexican imports set to expire that day. The 25% auto tariff announced by the president on March 26 is also scheduled to take effect on April 2.",
      "What are reciprocal tariffs?",
      "Reciprocal tariffs enacted by the U.S. would match foreign nations' levies and other trade policies on American goods.",
      "A reciprocal tariff policy would include calculating a country-specific number that the Trump administration deems representative of all trade barriers. But import restrictions other than tariffs, such as regulatory requirements, could be hard to quantify, economists say.",
      "\"There are a lot of intangibles, like testing regulations for different products in countries, or perceived openness to business with American companies,\" Simon Macadam, deputy chief global economist at Capital Economics, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"These are things you can't easily put a number on.\"",
      "Because of this complexity, some experts expect Trump's reciprocal tariffs could be more limited in scope, and might not be truly \"reciprocal\" because they may not exactly match other countries' levies.",
      "\"We shouldn't be surprised if some of the stuff is rolled back, or not as sweeping as maybe originally talked about, because logistically, from a practical perspective, running the calculations and coming up with a number is extremely time consuming,\" Grabow of the Cato Institute said.",
      "Wilbur Ross, who served as the U.S. Secretary of Commerce during the first Trump administration, agreed that a truly reciprocal tariff policy would be \"very complicated to get to work.\"",
      "\"If you were literally going to be reciprocal, you would put the same tariff on a product that comes into the U.S. as that country charges on products from the U.S.,\" he said. \"But the problem is you'd be charging a different tariff on the same item from different countries.\"",
      "That would create loopholes for exporters to ship products through lower-tariffed countries to the U.S., Ross added. \"It would make it easy for people to game the system,\" he said.",
      "What does Trump want to achieve?",
      "Through his \"Fair and Reciprocal Plan\" on trade, Mr. Trump is aiming to bring about three outcomes: Boost U.S. manufacturing jobs; close the $1.2 trillion U.S. trade deficit; and gain leverage over U.S. trade partners.",
      "But experts say that trade barriers such as tariffs may not be enough to revitalize U.S. manufacturing jobs, which have fallen sharply over the last few decades. Fewer than 13 million people are employed in manufacturing today, down from a peak of 19.6 million in 1979,\u00a0according to federal data.",
      "\"To a large extent, and particularly in low- and medium-tech industries, the economics of production will not be significantly altered by a 10-20% tariff,\" Macadam said. \"When labor costs in hubs like Mexico are one-fifth of what they are in the U.S., in order to induce companies to seriously relocate a lot of production back to the U.S. a 20% tariff isn't going to cut it.\"",
      "There's also the unknown of how long any new tariffs announced by Mr. Trump will remain in place. Such uncertainty could deter American or foreign businesses from investing heavily in re-shoring manufacturing to the U.S.",
      "\"Even if for some companies it gets to the point where it seems to make financial sense to move back to the U.S., there's the question of, 'Are these tariffs actually going to last a long time?'\" Macadam said. \"If you think the tariff is going to be there forever, then yeah, absolutely relocate. But if it's reversed or rates are lowered, then it would have been silly to relocate.\"",
      "What will tariffs mean for consumers?",
      "Consumers typically pay the price for tariffs, as companies have said they plan on passing off much of the costs to their customers.",
      "As a result, a round of fresh tariffs could boost inflation, economists say. According to an analysis by Oxford Economics, if the effective tariff rate on imports into the U.S. rises from their 2024 level of 2.5% to 10% in April, which is what Oxford Economics expects, prices in aggregate would rise by half a percentage point.",
      "\"Inflation was on trend to fall \u2014 now we expect it to rise,\" Michael Pearce, senior U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, told CBS MoneyWatch.",

Even so, those gains couldn't offset steep losses recorded earlier in the month, with the S&P 500 marking its worst quarterly performance since 2022.",
      "Mr. Trump has dubbed April 2\u00a0\"Liberation Day\" because the new reciprocal tariffs, he says, will restore trade balances between the U.S. and other nations.",
      "But investors are cautious about the impact of a round of new tariffs, which are import fees that are largely passed onto U.S. consumers in the form of higher prices. Consumer confidence this month slumped to a 12-year low as more Americans are expressing concerns about tariffs and a pick-up in inflation.",
      "During the first three months of 2025, the S&P 500 lost 4.6%, marking the worst quarter in two-and-a-half years. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite ended the first three months of the year with a 10.4% decline, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average shed 2.2% over the same period.",
      "Monday's neck-twisting turn has become routine for the U.S. stock market recently because of uncertainty about what Mr. Trump will do with tariffs. Investors are anxious over a potentially toxic mix of worsening inflation and a slowing U.S. economy because households are afraid to spend due to a deepening trade war escalated by Mr. Trump.",
      "\"Consumers are getting fed up, sending confidence to recession levels amid growing fears of higher inflation and deteriorating economic prospects,\" wrote Bob Schwartz, senior economist at Oxford Economics, in a March 28 research note.",
      "The details of Mr. Trump's next round of import taxes are still sketchy, although the president is expected to announce plans for so-called reciprocal tariffs, which are designed to match the import duties placed on U.S. goods and services by other nations.",
      "Most economic analyses say average U.S. families would have to absorb the cost of his tariffs in the form of higher prices and lower incomes, a tough proposition for inflation-weary Americans.",

      "Tesla stock slump",
      "Tesla's woes continued as CEO Elon Musk's electric car company slid 1.7% on Monday. Tesla is down about 39% since Trump took office Jan. 20, with losses driven in part by the public perception of Musk's oversight of the new Department of Government Efficiency that's slashing government spending.",
      "Tesla sales in Europe and the U.S. have fallen, partly due to Musk's political shift to the right. Protestors have targeted the automaker's showrooms, vehicle lots and charging stations, with some resorting to vandalism, including burning privately owned vehicles.",
      "Apple shares were down less than 1% after France's antitrust watchdog fined the tech giant $162 million over the rollout of a privacy feature resulted in abuse of competition law.",

    "published": "Mon, 31 Mar 2025 12:51:00 -0400",
    "summary": "These automakers are the most and least exposed to President Trump's sweeping tariffs on automobiles.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration's 25% tariffs on vehicles and auto parts imported into the U.S. could lead to sticker shock for American consumers, including for those buying cars manufactured domestically, analysts say.",
      "Few vehicle manufacturers will be spared by the fresh levies, which are aimed at revitalizing domestic automobile manufacturing. Industry analysts say the tax will surely raise car prices in the U.S. and squeeze some would-be car buyers out of the market.",
      "Some manufacturers could move a share of production to the U.S., but it would come \"at the expense of reduced competition, higher prices, and significantly lower production in the U.S.'s main trading partners,\" Oxford Economics analyst Abby Stamp said in a research note.",
      "The automobile supply chain is highly complex and intertwined with the economies of Mexico and Canada, from which American brands source finished vehicles and parts. Mr. Trump's tariff on passenger cars and light trucks imported into the U.S. will go into effect April 3, according to the executive order, and a 25% tariff on auto parts shipped from foreign countries goes into effect \"no later than May 3.\"",
      "The price of a typical car could rise by between $5,000 to $10,000 \"out of the gates\" due to the new tariffs, according to a March 31 estimate from Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives.",
      "Meanwhile, car insurance premiums are also likely to jump because the tariffs will make it more expensive to repair vehicles, partly due to higher costs for purchasing new auto parts.",
      "Average insurance premiums could rise to $2,759, or a 19% bump from the typical cost in the fourth quarter of 2024, according to a new projection from Insurify. That increase would come after car insurance costs jumped 11% in February from a year earlier, making it one of the fastest-rising components in the Consumer Price Index (CPI), which measures inflation.",
      "While all car manufacturers will be impacted by the new tariffs, according to analysts, some will be hit much harder than others.",
      "Tesla",
      "Tesla CEO Elon Musk, a close ally of Mr. Trump, posted on X Wednesday that the new tariffs would affect the company's American-made electric vehicles.",
      "\"Important to note that Tesla is NOT unscathed here. The tariff impact on Tesla is still significant,\" Musk wrote on X Wednesday. \"To be clear, this will affect the price of parts in Tesla cars that come from other countries. The cost impact is not trivial,\" he wrote in a later post.",
      "That said, Tesla is expected to be among the automakers that are least affected by the tariffs, given that its vehicles are made in the U.S., and most of their parts are sourced domestically, too. The EV brand does, however, rely on China for some batteries, \"so the tariffs will have an impact,\" Art Wheaton, a transportation industry expert and director of labor studies at Cornell's School of Industrial and Labor Relations, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Tesla rival Rivian could also be spared for similar reasons, according to UBS.",
      "\"We believe TSLA and RIVN could fare better as 100% of their production is in the U.S. (though not all components),\" UBS analysts said in a research note.",
      "General Motors",
      "General Motors, one of the so-called Big Three automakers, along with Stellantis and Ford, is widely expected to be the most exposed to the forthcoming auto tariffs. Headquartered in Detroit, the U.S. car company makes just 45% of vehicles it sells to U.S. customers domestically, leaving 55% of its lineup exposed to tariffs, according to Cox Automotive.",
      "GM, which makes Chevrolet, Buick, GMC and Cadillac vehicles, is heavily invested in Mexico and Canada, where it builds heavy-duty vehicles, according to Cornell's Wheaton.",
      "Stellantis",
      "Stellantis, whose brands include Jeep, Chrysler, Dodge and Ram, among others, is similarly susceptible to rising costs from the tariffs, as it makes between 73%-75% of vehicles for sale in the U.S. stateside, according to Cox Automotive.",
      "That means an $80,000 RAM truck from Stellantis could cost $100,000 once it reaches the U.S., under the new policy.",
      "\"The impact is quite large,\" Wheaton said.",
      "Ford",
      "Ford is among the car companies better positioned to weather the tariffs, according to Cox Automotive analyst Erin Keating, as 80% of its vehicles are manufactured in the U.S. and therefore would not be subject to the 25% tariff on passenger cars. However, any imported parts used in Ford's U.S.-manufactured vehicles could be tariffed at 25%.",
      "Ford vehicles made in the U.S. include the F-150 pickup truck lineup. Some of its smaller vehicles, including the Maverick pickup truck and Bronco Sport SUV are made in Mexico and \"will take a hit,\" said Wheaton.",
      "While domestic automakers will face increased costs, it's unclear how much of the tax they'll pass along to consumers. The\u00a0Wall Street Journal,\u00a0reported that Mr. Trump warned the CEOs of the Big Three not to raise car prices because of tariffs, according to people familiar with the matter.",
      "Toyota and Honda",
      "Japanese automakers Toyota and Honda export a large number of vehicles and auto parts from Japan to the U.S., which represents a sizable market for the companies. Both also operate big plants in Canada, Wheaten noted, leaving them particularly vulnerable to added costs from new tariffs.",
      "The same goes for South Korean automakers Hyundai and Kia.",
      "BMW and Volkswagen",
      "German automakers, including BMW and Volkswagen, which makes Audi vehicles, both operate big plants in Mexico.",
      "The May 3 auto-parts tariff will likely apply to engines and transmission systems, and hit the company \"heavily,\" according to Wheaton.",
      "BMW, for instance, makes a lot of engines in Germany, which it then ships to South Carolina, where the automaker manufactures SUVs. The company could be hit \"heavily,\" by the auto-parts tariffs, according to Wheaton.",
      "Mercedes-Benz operates similarly, sending engines and transmissions from Germany to a plant in Alabama, where the company manufactures SUVs. The 25% auto tariffs would also likely apply to fully assembled Mercedes vehicles shipped to the U.S.",
      "\"I don't think any brands will be spared, because none are 100% in the U.S.,\" Wheaton said. \"They all have products from Canada, Mexico or elsewhere. And even Tesla, which is the most American, still has non-U.S. content in their vehicles.\"",
      "Tariffs could spark affordability issues",
      "Even vehicles whose parts aren't subject to tariffs and that are assembled in the U.S. could face price hikes, as automakers attempt to spread new costs out across their lineups. While Cox Automotive expects price hikes of between 15-20% on vehicles that are caught in the tariffs' crosshairs, those that are exempt could still go up by about 5%, Keating noted.",
      "The auto tariffs could ignite new affordability challenges for consumers by moving lower-cost vehicles closer to, or in some cases over the $30,000 threshold.",
      "Take, for example, a Hyundai Venue, a subcompact crossover SUV, with an average current list price of $24,000. Under Mr. Trump's auto tariffs, that price could rise to about $28,500, adding more than $4,000 to an affordable design.",
      "\"Sub- $30,000 compact SUVs and crossovers that are the most popular are almost all foreign-made, with the exception of one or two,\" Keating said. \"So they'd all be subjected to the 25% tariffs.\"",
      "At the other end of the economic spectrum, luxury Italian car maker Ferrari on Thursday said it would hike prices on certain car models by 10% after April 1, citing Mr. Trump's auto tariffs.

    "published": "Mon, 31 Mar 2025 08:27:52 -0400",
    "summary": "Most Americans say the matter of Trump administration officials discussing U.S. military plans on the Signal app is serious.",
    "story": [
      "After a week that brought tough economic news and polling showing Americans'\u00a0views of the economy\u00a0are still sour, most say President Trump has focused too much on tariffs \u2014 which they believe will end up raising prices \u2014 and not enough on lowering prices.",
      "This has Americans collectively skeptical right now about the ability of Mr. Trump's policies to make them financially better off, a sentiment that was key to the success of his 2024 campaign.",
      "Yet that's balanced out for Mr. Trump today by continued majority approval on immigration and on his deportation program, specifically. That comes especially \u2014 but not exclusively \u2014 from his Republican base, many of whom say that's just as important as the economy in their evaluations.",
      "Meanwhile, the public continues to weigh the changes brought by the federal workforce reductions, with many believing they will impact programs they care about.",
      "But the matter involving administration officials' use of the Signal app, while seen as serious, does not seem tied to evaluations of Mr. Trump overall.",
      "From a list of items, most say the administration is focused too much on tariffs, and by contrast, is not focused enough on lowering prices.",
      "Donald Trump won the 2024 election in large part on the economy and the idea that he'd make Americans financially better off.",
      "Just before he took office, a sizable four in 10 felt his policies as president would do just that.",
      "Asked about what's happening today, just a quarter of Americans say those policies are making them financially better off. Nearly twice as many say he's making their finances worse.",
      "Even among Republicans, things have tempered. Just before he took office, three-fourths of Republicans said Mr. Trump's policies as president would make them better off, and now, under half of them say that's what is happening so far.",
      "Tariffs, or the threat of them, don't seem to be helping.",
      "Most oppose new tariffs, as they have for a while, and big numbers think that'll lead to higher prices in the short term.",
      "The administration has argued that tariffs will have long-term benefits, but people are more inclined to think they'll raise prices rather than lower them in the long term, too. Tariffs on imported cars in particular aren't popular, either.",
      "(Prices, of course, have been a key concern for years. They are the number one reason that people still rate the economy badly,\u00a0according to recent polling.)",
      "Importantly, though, Mr. Trump doesn't fully \"own\" the issue. Joe Biden still gets a little more blame for today's inflation rate than Mr. Trump does.",
      "Mr. Trump's approval for handling inflation specifically remains negative, and his rating on handling the economy in general has edged into negative territory since last month.",
      "That balances against net-positive ratings for immigration (which are extremely positive with Republicans), and he's even overall.",
      "His overall approval rating has ticked down just a point from last month and is a few points lower than at the start of his term, though it remains above what he got at any point during his first term.",
      "Trump's deportation program, specifically, retains majority approval. That hasn't really changed in recent weeks.",
      "As for some potential implications, as a general principle it's not acceptable to most if some legal U.S. residents were to be mistakenly detained by immigration authorities. But half of Republicans say it would be acceptable.",
      "Judges and the courts",
      "Americans overwhelmingly support the principle of judicial review of the legality of Mr. Trump's policies, including most Republicans. But there's also been calls from some to try to impeach federal judges who rule against Mr. Trump's policies, and that also finds favor with a majority of Republicans, especially those who identify as part of the MAGA movement.",
      "Federal workforce and DOGE",
      "Views on Mr. Trump's efforts to reduce the federal workforce are evenly split in the country.",
      "One reason is that most think the reductions will impact programs and services they care about. A slight majority still think Musk and DOGE have too much influence \u2014 with Republicans, again, standing differently than other Americans.",
      "On the matter of Trump administration officials discussing U.S. military plans on the Signal messaging app, most Americans, including most Republicans, say the matter is serious. And most don't think it was appropriate to use the app to discuss military plans.",
      "Democrats are more likely than Republicans to be following this story.",
      "So far, this situation isn't adversely affecting Republicans in their overall evaluation of Mr. Trump. An overwhelming majority of Republicans who describe what happened as very or somewhat serious still approve of him. Four in 10 Republicans do say what happened was appropriate.",
      "And most Americans would not approve of Donald Trump having the U.S. take control of Greenland.",
      "The Role of Congress",
      "Democrats increasingly call for their party in Congress to oppose Trump \u2014 these figures have risen with each poll.",
      "And those Democrats who are calling for this overwhelmingly say their party in Congress could be doing more to oppose him.",
      "Relatively few Americans, including those in his own party, would generally want to see Mr. Trump have more power as president than he already does; they feel he has the right amount now. And they do see a role for the party in Congress. Majorities of Republicans would have their members push back on Mr. Trump if they disagree.",
      "This CBS News/YouGov survey was conducted with a nationally representative sample of 2,609 U.S. adults interviewed between March 27-28, 2025. The sample was weighted to be representative of adults nationwide according to gender, age, race, and education, based on the U.S. Census American Community Survey and Current Population Survey, as well as 2024 presidential vote.

    "story": [
      "Crowds protesting billionaire Elon Musk's purge of the U.S. government under President Trump began amassing outside Tesla dealerships throughout the U.S. and in some cities in Europe on Saturday in the latest attempt to dent the fortune of the world's richest man.",
      "The protesters are trying to escalate a movement targeting Tesla dealerships and vehicles in opposition to Musk's role as the head of the newly created Department of of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, where he's gained access to sensitive data and shuttered entire agencies as he attempts to slash government spending. Most of Musk's estimated $340 billion fortune consists of the stock he holds in the electric vehicle company that he continues to run while also working alongside Mr. Trump.",
      "Earlier protests have been somewhat sporadic. Saturday marked the first attempt to surround all 277 of the automaker's showrooms and service centers in the U.S. in hopes of deepening\u00a0a recent decline in the company's sales.",
      "By early afternoon, crowds ranging from a few dozen to hundreds of protesters had flocked to Tesla locations in New Jersey, Massachusetts, Connecticut, New York, Maryland, Minnesota and the automaker's home state of Texas. Pictures posted on social media accounts showed protesters brandishing signs such as\u00a0\"Honk if you hate Elon\"\u00a0and\u00a0\"Fight the billionaire broligarchy.\"",
      "The Tesla Takedown movement also hoped to rally protestors at more than 230 Tesla locations in other parts of the world. Although the turnouts in Europe weren't as large as the crowds in the U.S., the anti-Musk sentiment was similar.",
      "About two dozen protesters held signs lambasting Musk outside a Tesla dealership in London as passing cars and trucks tooted horns in support.",
      "One of the signs displayed at the London protest showed a photo of Musk next to an image of Adolf Hitler making the Nazi salute \u2014 a\u00a0gesture that Musk has been accused of reprising shortly after Mr. Trump's Jan. 20 inauguration. A person in a tyrannosaurus rex costume held another sign with a picture of Musk's straight-arm gesture that said, \"You thought the Nazis were extinct. Don't buy a Swasticar.\"",
      "\"We just want to get loud, make noise, make people aware of the problems that we're facing,\" said Cam Whitten, an American who showed up at the London protest.",
      "Tesla Takedown was organized by a group of supporters that included disillusioned owners of the automaker's vehicles, celebrities such as actor John Cusack, and at least one Democratic Party lawmaker, Rep. Jasmine Crockett from Dallas.",
      "\"I'm going to keep screaming in the halls of Congress. I just need you all to make sure you all keep screaming in the streets,\" Crockett said during a\u00a0Tesla Takedown organizing call\u00a0held earlier this month.",
      "In New York City, mayoral hopeful and New York state Rep. Zohran Mamdani joined protesters at a Tesla showroom on Saturday.",
      "\"We are here in a moment that demands all of us,\" Mandani told the crowd through a megaphone. \"It demands all of us because the richest man in the world has purchased the president of the United States.\"",
      "Some people opposed to Musk have gone beyond protests and set the automaker's vehicles on fire and committed\u00a0other acts of vandalism that U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi has decried as \"nothing short of domestic terrorism.\" Musk indicated he was dumbfounded by the attacks during a March 20 company meeting and said the vandals should \"stop acting psycho.\"",
      "Crockett and other Tesla Takedown supporters have been stressing the importance for Saturday's protests to remain peaceful.",
      "But police were investigating a fire that destroyed seven Tesla vehicles in northwestern Germany early Saturday morning. It was wasn't immediately clear if the blaze, which was extinguished by firefighters, was related to the Tesla Takedown protests.",
      "There have been vandalisms at Tesla dealerships acrossing the U.S., including fires in Nevada and Missouri, and graffiti at locations in Massachusetts and Maryland, CBS News previously reported.",
      "Since January 2025, incidents targeting Tesla EVs have occurred in at least nine states, according to a joint intelligence bulletin issued by the Department of Homeland Security and FBI and obtained by CBS News.\u00a0Although U.S. intelligence suggests lone actors are behind them, Trump administration officials are promising to crack down on what they say are coordinated attacks.",
      "There have also been reports of vandalism to parked Teslas, making individual owners nervous.",
      "\"My wife cautions me, 'Be careful where you are at with it,'\" Bill Fonte told CBS New York. \"If you don't like the product, don't buy it. But they're going above and beyond, creating panic and concern for normal people like me.\"",
      "A growing number of consumers who bought Tesla vehicles before Musk took over DOGE have been looking to sell or trade in their cars while others have slapped on bumper stickers seeking to distance themselves from the billionaire's efforts to prune or shut down government agencies.",
      "But Musk didn't appear concerned about an extended slump in sales of new Tesla cars in his March 20 address to employees. He reassured the workers that the company's Model Y, which is undergoing a refresh, would remain \"the best-selling car on Earth again this year.\" He also predicted Tesla will have sold more than 10 million cars worldwide by next year, up from about 7 million cars now.",
      "\"There are times when there are rocky moments, where there is stormy weather, but what I am here to tell you is that the future is incredibly bright and exciting,\" Musk said.",
      "After Mr. Trump was elected last November, investors initially saw Musk's alliance with the president as a positive development for Tesla and its long-running efforts to launch\u00a0a network of self-driving cars.",
      "That optimism helped lift Tesla's stock by 70% in the period between Mr. Trump's Nov. 5 election and his Jan. 20 inauguration, creating an additional $560 billion in shareholder wealth. But virtually all those gains have evaporated amid investor worries about the Tesla backlash, lagging sales in the U.S., Europe and China, and Musk spending time overseeing DOGE.",
      "\"This continues to be a moment of truth for Musk to navigate this brand tornado crisis moment and get onto the other side of this dark chapter for Tesla,\" Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives said in a research note leading up to Saturday's protests.",

      "During a March 10 hearing, Jackson heard testimony about the chaos that erupted inside the agency after government employees were ordered to stop working last month. The bureau's chief operating officer, Adam Martinez, said the agency was in \"wind-down mode\" after Trump fired its previous director, Rohit Chopra, on Feb. 1.",
      "Trump installed a temporary replacement who ordered the immediate suspension of all agency operations, cancelled $100 million in contracts and fired 70 employees.",

      "CFPB is responsible for protecting consumers from financial fraud and deceptive practices. It processes consumer complaints and examines banks to protect student loan borrowers.",
      "The National Treasury Employees Union, which represents more than 1,000 workers at the bureau, sued on Feb. 9 to block mass firings. Plaintiffs' attorneys argue that the administration doesn't have the constitutional authority to eliminate an agency that Congress created by statute.",

      "Visits from Canada to the U.S. account for the sharpest projected decline in travel this year, with analysts pointing to President Trump's plan to slap tariffs on Canadian imports as causing some Canadians to hold off on traveling to the U.S.",
      "\"This sharp drop suggests that travellers are holding off on making reservations, likely due to ongoing uncertainty surrounding the broader trade dispute,\" the report states.",
      "Mr. Trump has delayed 25% tariffs on Canadian and Mexican imports until April 2, but economists say the import duties could have detrimental effects on their economies given their deep reliance on the U.S. The drop in airline demand reflects \"a degradation of travel demand between the two countries, especially coming from the Canadian side,\" Scott Keyes, founder of Going.com, a flight deals website, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "As Mr. Trump promotes an \"America First\" trade policy, Canadians are similarly focusing on spending their dollars domestically, following former Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's please last month for residents to \"choose Canada,\" former Canadian Member of Parliament Dr. Ruby Dhalla told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"Instead of traveling to the U.S., we are seeing families travel visiting cities, towns and villages and exploring Canada's history and heritage,\" Dhalla said.",

      "Weaker-than-usual demand could lead to deals on airfare for passengers who still plan to travel from Canada to the U.S., OAG said.",
      "\"For those that are still planning to travel there may be some airlines offering particularly cheap airfares over the next few months as they seek to stimulate demand but for the airlines it will be a nervous few months, especially as the traditional 'snowbird' market from Canada to the U.S. could be badly impacted next year if the situation doesn't improve quickly,\" the report states.",
      "Slashing routes to the U.S.",
      "Canadian airlines are expected to be hit harder than their American counterparts because the nation's residents are driving the downward trend, experts say. Americans typically prefer to fly American airlines because they might have loyalty accounts with a carrier, for example.",
      "Flair Airlines, a budget airline based in Canada, said last week it is cutting flights from Toronto to Nashville, as well as from Calgary to Las Vegas and Edmonton to Las Vegas.",

    "summary": "Wall Street skidded on Friday amid higher-than-expected inflation data and fears about the impact of President Trump's tariffs.",
    "story": [
      "Stocks are taking a battering on Friday amid growing concerns on Wall Street about the impact of President Trump's tariff regime as well as hotter-than-expected price data, sparking worries that the Federal Reserve is far from declaring victory on inflation.",
      "The Dow Jones Industrial Average tumbled 758 points, or 1.8%, to 41,541.09 in Friday afternoon trading, while the broad-based S&P 500 shed 2%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite index skidded 2.8%.",
      "Friday's stock market rout comes after Wall Street has already suffered a pummeling this year, with the S&P 500 down 9% from its most recent February high.",
      "Mr. Trump on Wednesday said he is imposing a\u00a025% tariff on all vehicles\u00a0and auto parts imported into the U.S., a move that is expected to add thousands of dollars to the cost of many vehicles. He also plans to announce more tariffs on April 2. Because tariffs are import taxes that companies largely pass onto consumers, many economists are forecasting an uptick in inflation later this year.",
      "At the same time, new economic data released on Friday shows that core inflation heated up last month, posing a challenge to the Federal Reserve's goal of driving inflation down to a 2% annual rate.",
      "\"The recent U.S. stock market correction appears to have been partially triggered by investors realising that Trump may follow through with his tariff threats and that this will hurt the U.S. economy,\" said Oxford Economics lead economist Daniel Harenberg and senior economist Kiki Sondh in a Friday report. \"Similarly, consumer sentiment has weakened due to tariff-induced inflation fears.\"",
      "The economy has so far been holding up relatively well, but if it were to weaken while inflation stays high, it would produce a worst-case scenario called \"stagflation,\" which policymakers in Washington have few good tools to fix.",
      "A report on Friday morning showed that U.S. consumers, including Republicans, Independents and Democrats, getting more pessimistic about their future finances. Two out of three consumers surveyed by the University of Michigan expect unemployment to worsen in the year ahead. That's the the highest reading since 2009, and it raises worries about a job market that's been the linchpin keeping the U.S. economy solid.",
      "At the same time, recent CBS News polling shows that Americans have become more dour in their economic outlooks, with relatively more consumers bracing for a slowdown or\u00a0recession\u00a0over the next year.",
      "Automaker stocks",
      "Shares of automakers tumbled on Friday, continuing a rout that began after Mr. Trump announced his new auto tariffs.\u00a0Hyundai Motor fell 2.6% in Seoul, while Honda Motor fell 2.6%, and Toyota Motor sank 2.8% in Tokyo.",
      "On Wall Street, Ford Motor fell 2.6%, and General Motors sank 1.7%. Even U.S. automakers selling vehicles in the country can feel the pain of such tariffs because their supply chains are spread throughout North America. Trump says he wants more manufacturing to take place within the United States.",
      "The rout also hit shares outside the auto industry, with investors concerned that Mr. Trump's trade war may cause U.S. households and businesses to freeze their spending. Even if the tariffs end up being less painful than feared, all the uncertainty may filter into changed behaviors that hurt the economy.",
      "Leading the market lower on Friday was Lululemon Athletica, which dropped 15%. Even though the seller of athletic apparel reported a stronger profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected, it warned that its revenue growth may slow this upcoming year as consumers grow more cautious.",
      "\"Consumers are spending less due to increased concerns about inflation and the economy,\" said CEO Calvin McDonald.",
      "Lululemon also said tariffs and shifting foreign-currency values may account for about half of its expected drop in a key measure of performance: how much profit it can squeeze out of each $1 of revenue.",
      "Oxford Industries, the company behind the Tommy Bahama and Lilly Pulitzer brands, likewise reported stronger results for the latest quarter than expected but still saw its stock fall 3.1%. CEO Tom Chubb said it saw a \"deterioration in consumer sentiment that also weighed on demand\" beginning in January, which accelerated into February.",

Milton's conviction came after a short seller called Hindenburg Research alleged in 2020 that the EV maker had misrepresented its technology.",

Once valued at around $30 billion, exceeding the market capitalization of Ford Motor Co., the EV maker was a rising Wall Street star before it became embroiled in scandal.",
      "Last month, Nikola said it plans to to continue limited service and support operations for vehicles on the road, including fueling operations through the end of March, subject to court approval. The company said that it would need to raise more funding to support those types of activities after that time.",

      "\"This will continue to spur growth like you haven't seen before,\" Mr. Trump said from the Oval Office Wednesday afternoon. \"We'll effectively be charging a 25% tariff. But if you build your car in the United States, there is no tariff.\"",
      "Mr. Trump said the new auto tariffs will take effect on April 2 and that the U.S. would start collecting the duties the following day. The president added he believes the new import duty could raise between $600 billion and $1 trillion in revenue for the U.S. over the next two years.",
      "\"This number will be used to reduce debt greatly,\" Mr. Trump said. \"Basically I view it as reducing taxes and reducing debt.\"",
      "White House staff secretary Will Scharf, who stood next to Mr. Trump during the announcement, offered a more conservative estimate of how much the new auto tariffs would raise, predicting roughly $100 billion in new revenue.",
      "Mr. Trump also reiterated his goal of making interest paid on auto loans tax deductible, while noting that such a deduction would apply only to cars made in the U.S.",
      "Tax deductions are generally only employed by high-income Americans because most taxpayers take the standard deduction, which means tax-deductible auto loans wouldn't impact low- or middle-income households.",
      "Meanwhile, car prices are \"likely to rise significantly\" for consumers, according to Rella Suskin, equity analyst at Morningstar in a Thursday research note. Suskin added, \"Domestically produced vehicles are expected to gain market share, but very few, even from US-based manufacturers, are made with 100% U.S. content.\"",

      "The latest salvo of tariffs comes after Mr. Trump earlier this month gave a one-month exemption to U.S. automakers from the round of import duties that took effect on March 4.",

      "Shares of the Big Three U.S. automakers \u2014 Ford, General Motors and Stellantis \u2014 all sank after Mr. Trump announced the new tariffs. In Thursday morning trading, Ford's shares slipped 38 cents, or 3.7% to $9.92, while GM tumbled 7.3%. Stellantis shed 2.6%.",
      "Tesla shares, which have slumped this year because of disappointing sales and\u00a0consumer unhappiness\u00a0over CEO Elon Musk's involvement with the Trump administration, rose $7.13, or 2.6%, to $279.19. Tesla manufactures its vehicles within the U.S., although Musk said on social media that the electric vehicle maker will still feel an impact. Some Tesla parts are imported from other countries.",

      "When reached for comment, Stellantis directed CBS News to the AAPC's statement.",
      "Mr. Trump has long said that tariffs on auto imports would be a\u00a0defining policy\u00a0of his presidency, betting that the costs created by the taxes would lead both American and foreign automakers to relocate production to U.S. soil.",
      "Automakers with U.S. plants still depend on Canada, Mexico and other nations for parts and finished vehicles. Because booting up manufacturing facilities would take time, in the medium term domestic auto prices would likely increase and car sales decline, experts say.",
      "Car prices could jump",
      "One analysis of Mr. Trump's tariffs estimated that auto prices could rise as much as\u00a0$12,200 for some models\u00a0due to the new import duties, according to a report from Anderson Economic Group, a Michigan-based economic consultancy.",
      "\"In the long-run, this could boost domestic investment and production. In the short-run, however, it will be inflationary and, assuming that domestic producers respond by substantially increasing their own prices, could make new vehicles something of a luxury item,\" Paul Ashworth, chief North America economist with Capital Economics, said in a report.",
      "Targeting imported cars also could strain ties with key trading U.S. partners including Canada, Japan, Mexico and South Korea, as well as Europe.",
      "\"I deeply regret the U.S. decision to impose tariffs on EU automotive exports,\" Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, said in a social media post. \"Tariffs are taxes \u2014 bad for businesses, worse for consumers in the U.S. and the EU. The EU will continue to seek negotiated solutions, while safeguarding its economic interests.\"",
      "About 50% of cars sold in the U.S. are manufactured within the country. Among imports, about half come from Mexico and Canada, with Japan, South Korea and Germany, also major suppliers.",
      "Other groups expressed support for the new auto tariffs.",

A 25% tariff on auto imports isn't the only way to spur more auto plants here, but it is in my view necessary.\"",

    "story": [
      "Some Social Security recipients could soon find themselves in the crosshairs of a policy that advocates for seniors say could cause financial hardship for many older Americans.",
      "Starting today, the Social Security Administration will begin clawing back overpayments from the retirement program by taking 100% of a beneficiary's monthly check until the money is repaid, up from the prior rate of 10%. The policy will impact new cases of overpayments starting on March 27. The benefits withholding rate for people who were overpaid before that date will remain at 10%.",
      "The agency's 100% recovery rate was announced earlier this month by SSA Acting Commissioner Lee Dudek, who has worked with Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, to cut costs at the agency by firing thousands of workers and closing field offices.",
      "Dudek has\u00a0described the 100% clawback rate as part of the agency's responsibility to recover overpaid funds. But advocates for older Americans say the policy will cause financial distress for many people, especially those who rely on the program for all or most of their income.",
      "\"If an overpayment is being made, that means the Social Security Administration is withholding 100% of their payment for however long it takes to repay the agency \u2014 and they are without money to pay for food\" or other living expenses, Dan Adcock, director of government relations and policy for the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare, an advocacy group, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "The clawback policy could prove especially hard on the 40% of Social Security beneficiaries who rely on the program for 90% of more of their income, he added.",
      "In many cases, Social Security overpayments are the fault of agency, with a\u00a02022 report\u00a0by its inspector general finding that about 73,000 overpayments that year were due to a lack of \"effective controls over benefit-computation accuracy.\"",
      "Under the Biden administration, the Social Security Administration in 2024\u00a0capped the clawback rate at 10%, stepping back from its prior 100% level following reports that the higher rate had pushed some Americans into financial hardship and even\u00a0homelessness.",
      "\"The thing is, this administration has said, 'We're going back to the old way, we're getting 100% of the money back going forward,'\" CBS News business analyst Jill Schlesinger told CBS News.",
      "Can you avoid a Social Security overpayment?",
      "In some cases, overpayments are due to miscalculations on the part of the Social Security Administration, or because the agency doesn't update beneficiaries' records in a timely way. That can make it difficult for seniors to know if they're getting paid too much.",
      "But it's also important for beneficiaries to update the SSA with their latest information, such as increases in their income that can lead to overpayments. The importance of updating the agency about such changes may not be fully appreciated by some beneficiaries because of the complexity of the Social Security system, the agency's inspector general said in a 2024 report.",
      "\"We urge beneficiaries to keep a close eye on their benefits going forward,\" said Shannon Benton, executive director of The Senior Citizens League, an advocacy group for older Americans. \"If they notice any unscheduled changes to their benefits, they should contact Social Security immediately.\"",
      "It's important to keep records of your payments and flag any issues, such as if your check is larger than it previously was, Schlesinger said. \"Unfortunately the onus is on us\" to correct the record, she added.",
      "DOGE cuts, long waits",
      "Because of DOGE's job cuts at the Social Security Administration and the closure of agency field offices, it's recently become more difficult for seniors and other beneficiaries to contact the agency to report changes or ask for help, Adcock said.",
      "Those issues arose in a Tuesday Senate confirmation hearing for President Trump's nominee for Social Security commissioner, Frank Bisignano, who said that only about 46% of phone calls to the agency are answered \"because people get discouraged and hang up\" due to long wait times.",
      "Sen. Steve Daines, a Republican from Montana, told Bisignano that one of his staffers this week called the agency's 800 number to assess the level of customer service, but was disconnected three times, once after being on hold for an hour.",
      "\"We've got a lot of work to do to serve the taxpayers in this country,\" Daines said.",
      "Improvements to Social Security?",
      "In the hearing, Bisignano also said he wants to reduce what the agency calls \"improper payments,\" which include both overpayments and underpayments to beneficiaries. Currently, about 1% of Social Security's annual payments are improper, with Bisignano saying he believes that rate should be \"five decimal points to the right.\"",
      "Yet enhancing the accuracy of benefits will likely take a large investment in Social Security because it would require changes in systems, technology and other resources, Benton said.",
      "\"While improvements are possible, achieving such a low error rate is challenging due to the complexity of Social Security benefits and past challenges with fraud and reporting errors,\" she said. \"Some progress is likely and will probably be incremental, but a significant reduction over the next four years will be extremely challenging.\"",
      "In the meantime, seniors and other Social Security recipients should watch their benefits closely and report changes in their income to the agency. And if people receives a beneficiary letter from the agency, they can also request a waiver, which can be made through\u00a0SSA form 632.",
      "\"While we believe that overpayments should be recouped, we believe it's essential that beneficiaries have time to plan, and not face undue pressure from an almost immediate 100% reduction in benefits,\" Benton said.",

    "summary": "Democratic Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey began speaking around 7 p.m. on Monday to protest Trump policies and didn't stop till after 8 p.m. on Tuesday.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014\u00a0Democratic Sen. Cory Booker delivered a record-breaking marathon speech on the Senate floor, which started Monday evening and continued more than 25 hours before wrapping up Tuesday night, in a protest against the Trump administration's policies.",
      "The speech now marks the longest on Senate record, surpassing Sen. Strom Thurmond's 24 hour and 18 minute address in 1957.",
      "While many senators have historically used long speeches to filibuster a bill or nomination, Booker's speech was not a filibuster since it did not occur during debate on a specific measure to block proceedings.",
      "Booker, a 55-year-old who first came to the Senate in 2013 and is now the fourth-ranking Democrat, began speaking around 7 p.m. on Monday and said he would continue speaking \"for as long as I am physically able.\" As the sun rose on Tuesday morning and then throughout the day, he was still speaking from the Senate floor.",
      "He passed the record-breaking mark at 7:19 p.m. ET, but kept on going, finally yielding the floor at 8:05 p.m.",
      "The Senate chamber erupted in applause as Booker broke the record, as Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer rose to mark the moment.",
      "\"Do you know how proud this caucus is of you, do you know how proud America is of you?\" Schumer said.",
      "Booker cited the legacy of leaders, like late congressman and civil rights activist John Lewis, whom he said stood up \"when this country was facing crossroads, was facing crises, they stood up.\"",
      "\"I rise today in an unusual manner,\" Booker said, before invoking Lewis' refrain to \"get in good trouble, necessary trouble, help redeem the soul of America.\"",
      "\"Tonight, I rise with the intention of getting in some good trouble,\" Booker said at the outset, pledging to disrupt the normal business of the Senate. \"I rise tonight because I believe sincerely that our country is in crisis\u2026 These are not normal times in America, and they should not be treated as such.\"",
      "More than 24 hours later, Booker was still speaking.",
      "The New Jersey Democrat spent some of that time reading letters from constituents who say they have been harmed by the Trump administration's policies, and condemning the administration more broadly \u2014 from trade wars to mass firings to deportations and threats to Medicaid.",
      "Booker occasionally yielded to his Democratic colleagues on the floor, including Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York and Senators Lisa Blunt Rochester of Delaware, Andy Kim of New Jersey, Peter Welch of Vermont, Dick Durbin of Illinois and Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, as they echoed his concerns with the administration and encouraged his effort. Still, Booker was not permitted to leave the Senate floor without risking control and continuation of his speech.",
      "After 7 a.m. Tuesday, Booker acknowledged the 12 hours that had passed, saying he was \"wide awake\" and would \"stand here for as many hours as I can.\" At noon, the Senate briefly paused for the chaplain to say a prayer, as is required under Senate rules during a continuous session. Booker continued to hold the floor.",
      "Asked by Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse how he was doing after the 17-hour mark, Booker said, \"I shall not complain.\"",
      "About 23 hours in, he joked, \"I, first amongst us all, really love to speak.\"",
      "As he approached the record, Booker thanked Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut for standing by him during nearly the entirety of the speech, while recalling Murphy's filibuster in 2016.",
      "\"You stood, and I stood with you,\" Booker said. \"And he said to me days ago, 'if you're going to do this, brother, I will your aide-de-camp this time.'\"",
      "Murphy marked the historic moment, noting that the previous record was set when Thurmond was fighting against civil rights and making the case for \"why this nation should continue to segregate Black and White.\"",
      "\"What you have done here today Sen. Booker couldn't be more different than what occurred on this floor in 1957,\" Murphy said. \"Today you are standing in the way not of progress, but of retreat.\"",
      "At the 24-hour mark, Booker brought his message back to Lewis and the \"good trouble\" that he invoked on Monday.",
      "\"This is the moment, generations get them, we're at a crossroads here, folks,\" Booker said, minutes before the record-breaking moment.",
      "Several members of the Congressional Black Caucus and other House members came to the floor at various intervals to observe the Senator's speech in the rear of the chamber, including Reps. Steven Horsford, Maxine Waters, Jonathan Jackson, Bonnie Watson Coleman, Sean Casten, Steve Cohen.",
      "Booker appeared to grow emotional as he surpassed Thurmond's record, saying he was not here because of Thurman's speech, but \"despite his speech.\"",
      "\"I'm here because as powerful as he was, the people were more powerful.\"",
      "What was the longest floor speech in Senate history?",
      "Prior to Booker's new record today, Sen. Strom Thurmond of South Carolina delivered the longest Senate speech on record, with a more than 24-hour filibuster in 1957. Thurmond carried out his filibuster in an effort to block civil rights legislation.",
      "Booker's marathon speech earlier eclipsed lengthy speeches delivered in recent years, including 21-hour filibuster by Sen. Ted Cruz in 2013 on Obamacare, and a 15-hour filibuster by Murphy on gun control.",

    "published": "Tue, 01 Apr 2025 20:14:36 -0400",
    "summary": "Experts estimate far lower figures in tariffs revenue, warning that President Trump's tariffs could drive up prices for American consumers.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump has argued that some of the tariffs he's imposing this week could help the government raise over $1 trillion in the next year or so, helping to reduce the national debt and even potentially offset some income taxes.",
      "But economists are skeptical that these tariffs can bring in as much as Mr. Trump claims, as consumers will likely reduce their spending on foreign goods when prices go up.",
      "Tariffs are often charged as a percentage of the price that importers pay foreign sellers. They aren't paid by foreign nations, but by U.S. companies who often pass the cost to American consumers by raising prices.",
      "\"You're going to see billions of dollars, even trillions of dollars coming into our country very soon in the form of tariffs,\" the president said last week.",
      "While economic analyses indicate Mr. Trump's tariffs could meaningfully increase annual tariff revenue, the president's trillion-dollar estimates are significantly higher than those provided by think tanks and even some of his own officials.",
      "How much Trump's new auto tariffs could generate",
      "In a recent news conference, White House staff secretary Will Sharf estimated that Mr. Trump's 25% tariff on vehicles and auto parts imported into the U.S. could raise \"roughly $100 billion in new revenue.\" At the same news conference, Mr. Trump claimed moments later \"anywhere from $600 billion to $1 trillion will be taken in over the relatively short-term period, meaning a year from now.\"",
      "The White House did not respond to a request to clarify the source of the discrepancy.",
      "The Yale Budget Lab, a nonpartisan think tank, has estimated that the auto tariffs could raise roughly $600 billion to $650 billion over a period of 10 years \u2014 not in a single year, as Mr. Trump suggested.",
      "\"On an annual basis on average that's $60 to 65 billion. We're not even close to trillions,\" said Ernie Tedeschi, director of economics at the Yale Budget Lab.",
      "The Yale Budget Lab also found that motor vehicle prices could rise by 13.5% on average for Americans, or an additional cost of $6,400 for an average new car.",
      "How much Trump's tariffs on Canada, Mexico, and China could generate",
      "The same researchers found Mr. Trump's 25% tariff on goods from Canada and Mexico, which are slated to go into effect this week, along with the additional 20% tax on Chinese imports that the president has already put in place, could generate roughly $150 billion annually, or up to $1.5 trillion over 10 years. They also found the average household could lose $1,600 to $2,000 each year in inflation-adjusted disposable income as a result of higher prices.",
      "Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs previously made higher estimates that Trump's increased tariffs on these countries could generate roughly $300 billion in new income per year.",
      "Either would be a meaningful increase over the $88 billion in customs duties collected at ports of entry in 2024.",
      "However, economists argue there's a ceiling to tariff revenue that remains below $1 trillion per year.",
      "The U.S. imported about $3.3 trillion in foreign goods last year, according to the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis. The Peterson Institute of International Economics estimated that even if Mr. Trump were to apply a 50% tariff to foreign imports from every country \u2014 which exceeds his stated plans \u2014 it would generate at most about $780 billion annually.",
      "\"If you make something 50% more expensive, you don't expect people to buy the same amount,\" said Kimberly Clausing, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute.",
      "Could tariff revenue replace income taxes?",
      "Mr. Trump has repeatedly floated the idea of using his tariff agenda to offset or even replace income taxes.",
      "\"Under the American first economic model, as tariffs on other countries go up, taxes on American workers and businesses will come down,\" Trump said in a speech to the House GOP in January.",
      "Income taxes generate over $2 trillion per year, according to the Department of the Treasury. Even if a president imposed 50% tariffs on all imports, the income generated would represent less than 40% of what income taxes bring in, according to the Peterson Institute.",
      "\"The problem is it can't raise anywhere near the amount of revenue you'd need to scuttle the income tax. And that's the really, I think, ironclad point,\" said Scott Lincicome, a vice president of general economics and trade at the Cato Institute, which is a libertarian think tank.",
      "Historians on U.S. trade note that tariffs have not been viewed as a primary way to raise revenue since income taxes were introduced in 1913.",
      "In 2024, tariff collections on imports represented just 1.7% of the more than $4.9 trillion in total federal revenue. And according to the Congressional Research Service, tariffs have not accounted for much more than 2% of federal revenue in the last 70 years.",

    "story": [
      "Employees across the massive U.S. Department of Health and Human Services began receiving notices of dismissal on Tuesday in a major overhaul expected to ultimately lay off up to 10,000 people. The notices come just days after President Trump moved to strip workers of their collective bargaining rights at HHS and other agencies throughout the government.",
      "Some employees found out they'd been cut when they arrived at work Tuesday morning and discovered their security badges had been disabled. Others waited in long lines to get into their buildings amid the delays and confusion.",
      "Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\u00a0announced a plan\u00a0last week to remake HHS which, through its agencies, is responsible for tracking health trends and disease outbreaks, conducting and funding medical research, monitoring the safety of food and medicine, and administering health insurance programs for nearly half the country.",
      "The plan would consolidate agencies that oversee billions of dollars for addiction services and community health centers across the country under a new office called the Administration for a Healthy America.",
      "As CBS News reported last week, the layoffs are expected to shrink HHS to 62,000 positions, lopping off nearly a quarter of its staff \u2014 10,000 jobs through layoffs and another 10,000 workers who took early retirement and voluntary separation offers. That's down from around 92,620 employees at the department in September 2024, according to federal\u00a0records. There were 81,917 at the end of the first Trump administration.",

      "\"They may as well be renaming it the Department of Disease because their plan is putting lives in serious jeopardy,\" Murray said Friday during a call with reporters.",
      "Multiple officials at the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration said Tuesday that teams across that agency have been impacted by the layoffs.",

Around 873 staff \u2014 two-thirds of its workforce \u2014 are expected to be cut from NIOSH, multiple leaders within the agency were told in recent days.",
      "Beyond layoffs at federal health agencies, cuts are beginning to happen at state and local health departments as a result of an HHS move last week to pull back more than $11 billion in COVID-19-related funds. Local and state health officials are still assessing the impact, but some health departments have already identified hundreds of jobs that stand to be eliminated because of lost funding, \"some of them overnight, some of them are already gone,\" said Lori Tremmel Freeman, chief executive of the National Association of County and City Health Officials.",
      "Union representatives for HHS employees received a notice Thursday that between 8,000 to 10,000 employees will be terminated. The department's leadership will target positions in human resources, procurement, finance and information technology. Positions in \"high cost regions\" or that have been deemed \"redundant\" will be the focus of the layoffs.",

    "story": [
      "The Trump administration admitted in a court filing Monday that an \"administrative error\" and an \"oversight\" resulted in a Salvadoran man's deportation and imprisonment in a supermax prison in El Salvador, despite a legal order prohibiting his removal there.",
      "Acting Immigration and Customs Enforcement field office director Robert Cerna said that Kilmar Abrego Garcia was removed from the U.S. on March 15 as part of a series of deportation flights that sent hundreds of alleged gang members to a notorious prison in El Salvador, even though an immigration judge had granted him a legal protection from deportation.",
      "Those flights are at the center of a court battle between the Justice Department and U.S. District Court Judge James Boasberg, who blocked further deportations of alleged Tren de Aragua gang members under the Trump administration's invocation of the Alien Enemies Act of 1798.",
      "The March 15 deportation flights transported 238 Venezuelas and 23 Salvadorans, all of whom Trump administration officials described as members of the Tren de Aragua and MS-13 gangs. Lawyers and relatives of many of the Venezuelans have strongly denied claims that their clients and loved ones are gang members.",
      "The filings were made as part of a suit filed by attorneys for Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran man and Maryland resident who received a legal status known as \"withholding of removal\" in 2019 after an immigration judge found that Abrego Garcia, who left his native country in 2011 at age 16, could face persecution by gangs if deported to El Salvador. His case was first reported by The Atlantic late Monday.",
      "Although the Trump administration concedes it made a mistake when it deported Abrego Garcia, it is opposing a request for him to be brought back to the U.S. The government has argued Abrego Garcia is a danger to the community, alleging that he's a member of the MS-13 gang.",
      "The Justice Department has also argued that federal courts lack the authority to facilitate Abrego Garcia's return, since he's now being held by the Salvadoran government and no longer in U.S. custody. Even if they did have the power to order his return, the Justice Department said in a filing, there has been \"no showing that El Salvador is even inclined to consider a request to release a detainee at the United States' request.\"",

His lawyers said he has no criminal record in the U.S., a finding the government has not disputed.",
      "In 2019, Abrego Garcia was standing outside of a Home Depot in Hyattsville, Maryland, soliciting work with three other men when he was arrested. His attorney said he was questioned about whether he was a gang member, and when he told police he was not, the police said they didn't believe him and said they were calling ICE.",
      "During immigration proceedings, Abrego Garcia's attorneys said the only evidence the government provided in support of his gang affiliation was that he was wearing a Chicago Bulls hat and hoodie and that a confidential informant said he was an active MS-13 member in a branch of the gang that operates on Long Island, New York, where Abrego Garcia's attorneys say he has never lived.",
      "\"He's not a gang member. The allegations against him are based on whispers and shadows,\" Sandoval-Mosheberg said.",
      "Abrego Garcia's attorneys wrote in their initial complaint\u00a0that their client's name was not included in a Hyattsville City Police Department report about the Home Depot arrest, and said that the detective who authored the gang affiliation part of the report had been suspended.",

      "Senior leaders at multiple agencies were removed, multiple health officials said, including Dr. Jeanne Marrazzo. Marrazzo replaced Dr. Anthony Fauci as the head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.",
      "At the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, senior officials put on leave and reassigned to the Indian Health Service include Dr. Karen Hacker, head of the agency's chronic disease teams, Kayla Laserson, head of its global health center and Dr. Jonathan Mermin, director of the CDC's STD and HIV/AIDS center.",
      "\"The revolution begins today!\" Kennedy posted Tuesday on X.",

      "Another official said that senior leaders in their team had been offered reassignment to remote locations several states away, one official said. At the Food and Drug Administration, one official had been told that refusing the reassignment would result in them losing their severance pay.",
      "\"How insulting to IHS and the center directors. The IHS sites fill critical gaps, they aren't an American Gulag Archipelago,\" one CDC official said.",
      "Other top officials effectively ousted Tuesday include Dr. John Howard, head of the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health, and Dr. Brian King, the top regulator of tobacco products at the Food and Drug Administration, current and former officials said.",
      "In a statement, an official for the department said that the Indian Health Service was not impacted by this week's cuts and that that the agency \"has long faced challenges related to staffing shortages.\"",
      "\"To address staffing needs and support the IHS in fulfilling its mission, HHS has invited certain individuals to consider positions within the IHS. These invitations are voluntary, and individuals have the option to accept or decline,\" the official said.",

      "New leaders at the FDA and NIH also started on the job Tuesday, HHS announced. They were confirmed by the Senate earlier this month.",

      "In Hacker's center at the CDC, multiple teams were gutted by the layoffs, according to a list circulated among agency officials, including the Division of Reproductive Health, Division of Population Health and Office of Smoking and Health. Under Mermin's STD and HIV/AIDS center, tuberculosis elimination and studies branches were cut.",
      "It comes after several top officials have already resigned or been forced out at federal health agencies, including the FDA's top vaccines official Dr. Peter Marks last week and the agency's top food safety and nutrition official earlier this year.",
      "More resignations or cuts are expected in the coming weeks, officials said, as leaders at the agencies wrestle with the chaos caused by the cuts.",
      "Many agency leaders said they had been left in the dark about the cuts, asking staff to let them know whether they had received reduction-in-force notices Tuesday.",

    "published": "Tue, 01 Apr 2025 17:35:38 -0400",
    "summary": "President Trump has signed a string of executive orders in recent weeks targeting some of the nation's most prominent law firms.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump's string of executive orders in recent weeks that target major law firms mark the latest front in his effort to settle long-held scores with political opponents. But the broadside has been met with alarm about the damage the punishments could do to the viability of the firms and, crucially, the threat they pose to the rule of law.",
      "The executive orders signed by Mr. Trump have so far targeted four law firms: Perkins Coie, Paul Weiss, Wilmer Cutler Pickering Hale and Dorr LLP, and Jenner & Block. But the directive targeting Paul Weiss was rescinded after it and Mr. Trump reached an agreement under which the firm agreed to provide $40 million in pro bono legal services for causes that the administration supports, among other assurances.",
      "A fifth firm, Covington & Burling, was the subject of a directive that targeted the security clearance of a lawyer who assisted former special counsel Jack Smith, who oversaw the two prosecutions of Mr. Trump that were dropped, one in July 2024, and the other after he was elected to a second term. And a sixth, Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP, entered into a preemptive deal with the president to provide more than $100 million in free legal work, along with other commitments. The president announced Tuesday an agreement with Willkie Farr & Gallagher LLP, where former second gentleman Doug Emhoff is a partner, in which the firm would offer at least $100 million in pro bono services. The firm also represented former\u00a0Georgia election workers Ruby Freeman and Shaye Moss in their lawsuit against Trump ally Rudy Giuliani.",
      "The executive orders are among the more than 100 that Mr. Trump has issued since returning to the White House for a second term, and they come amid a broader campaign of retribution against his critics that includes revoking security clearances and protective details.",
      "But legal scholars warn that the restrictions aimed at the law firms strike at the rule of law and the nation's adversarial system of justice.",
      "\"These orders do more than just take revenge against particular lawyers who have crossed Donald Trump,\" said Walter Olson, a senior fellow at the Cato Institute. \"They are meant to send the message that it is dangerous to oppose him in court, that you are apt to suffer not just yourself, but also law firms that you're associated with will suffer sweeping penalties that can threaten their very ability to go on existing.\"",
      "The orders rolled out by Mr. Trump in the past few weeks target the firms for their legal work, as well as the lawyers who were on their payrolls \u2014 even if they're not anymore.",
      "In the case of Perkins Coie, the president's directive attacks the firm for representing Hillary Clinton during her 2016 presidential campaign and hiring a research firm that retained former British spy Christopher Steele, who produced the infamous \"Steele Dossier.\"",
      "For WilmerHale and Jenner & Block, the orders seek to punish the firms because they hired lawyers who worked on the Justice Department's investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election during Mr. Trump's first term. At WilmerHale, that includes Robert Mueller, the former special counsel who led that probe, and two lawyers who worked on his team, Aaron Zebley and James Quarles. Mueller and Quarles no longer work at WilmerHale. At Jenner & Block, the president attacked the firm for employing Andrew Weissmann, who also worked on Mueller's probe. He left Jenner & Block in 2021.",
      "Jenner & Block, WilmerHale and Perkins Coie are also involved in legal challenges to Mr. Trump's second-term policies, including his effort to withhold federal funds from medical institutions that provide gender-affirming care to young people under the age of 19, his firing of eight inspectors general and directive to prohibit transgender people from serving in the military.",
      "\"These firms are at the vanguard of fighting the Trump administration on a whole host of issues,\" said David Lat, a lawyer-turned-writer who authors a newsletter on legal affairs. \"So, if Donald Trump can force or frighten law firms into not taking cases against his administration, that will allow the administration to become more powerful.\"",
      "Lat likened the executive orders to a boxing match where one fighter is trying to chop the arms off of their opponent.",
      "\"In America, our legal system rests on the idea that you are entitled to a lawyer, and these executive orders are deterring law firms and lawyers from taking certain cases,\" he said. \"The other issue is they are a threat to the rule of law, and they are a threat to the adversarial system that powers our justice system.\"",
      "Mr. Trump justified the orders as furthering his administration's commitment to addressing the \"significant risks\" associated with \"Big Law firms,\" which he claims \"engage in conduct detrimental to critical American interests.\"",
      "The president's orders specifically require any government contractors to disclose any business they have with the firms and also direct agency heads to cancel any contracts with the targets of the orders. Agencies also must reassess contracts with the firms or companies that do business with them to ensure funding decisions align \"with the interests of the citizens of the United States\" and administration priorities.",
      "Finally, Mr. Trump's executive actions calls on his administration to restrict access to federal buildings for employees of Perkins Coie, WilmerHale and Jenner & Block.",
      "The three firms have all filed federal lawsuits challenging the orders as violations of the First, Fifth and Sixth Amendments.",
      "\"This lawsuit is absolutely critical to vindicating the First Amendment, our adversarial system of justice, and the rule of law,\" Paul Clement, who served as solicitor general under President George W. Bush and has argued more than 100 cases before the Supreme Court, said in a statement. Clement is representing WilmerHale in its challenge to Mr. Trump's executive order.",
      "Three different judges assigned to each of the cases \u2014 appointed by two different presidents \u2014 have agreed to temporarily block portions of the orders while proceedings move forward. While the cases may end with a decision from the Supreme Court months from now that invalidates the directives as unconstitutional, the fallout has been swift.",
      "Thomas Perrelli, firm chair and a partner at Jenner & Block, said in a declaration last week that one client was notified by the Justice Department that they could not bring their lawyers from the firm to a department meeting set for April 3. That client, Perrelli wrote, would've had to attend the meeting without their outside representation or hire new counsel. A federal district court blocked enforcement of the portion of Mr. Trump's order restricting Jenner & Block employees' access to federal buildings and the requirements for government contractors.",
      "He also wrote that 40% of the firm's revenue last year came from clients who are government contractors or subcontractors, and warned that if the firm lost that business, \"it would be a serious threat to the firm's financial health.\"",
      "Bruce Berman, general counsel at WilmerHale, wrote in his own declaration that at least 21 of the firm's 25 largest clients in 2024 \u2014 which accounted for 30% of its revenue, or nearly $500 million \u2014 have federal contracts. He noted that WilmerHale attorneys are set to meet with Justice Department lawyers over videoconference this week, but said at the time of his filing that it was uncertain whether they would refuse to meet with them.",
      "At Perkins Coie, David Burman, a partner at the firm, told a federal court in a filing that several clients terminated or said they were considering ending their legal engagements because of the restrictions imposed by Mr. Trump's order. Burman said that a major government contractor that had been a client for more than 35 years withdrew its work from Perkins Coie in light of the order, and four other clients rescinded its work from the firm early last month because they needed to engage with federal agencies.",
      "\"The orders don't have to go into effect for them to strike fear in the hearts of lawyers across the country,\" Lat said, adding that while law firms are wealthy, they can also be fragile.",
      "For many so-called \"Big Law\" firms, their work involves serving not only individuals, but also large corporations that seek help with patent or trademark applications, mergers and acquisitions or energy transactions \u2014 areas that land before a federal regulatory agency.",
      "But a swift departure of those clients means firms are at risk of losing sizable chunks of business at once, which could also force their lawyers to leave if their practice area involves significant government involvement.",
      "\"These firms can face a run of clients against them the same way the banks can face a run of depositors trying to take out their money at once,\" Olson said. \"This can quickly turn into a downward spiral.\"",
      "The potential damage to their business \u2014 and the ripple effect that would have on employees \u2014 may be why some law firms have remained on the sidelines and chosen not to speak out against Mr. Trump's sanctions. Olson acknowledged there are many reasons why other firms may want to stay out of the president's sight line for fear of retaliation.",
      "But he said that an \"age-old part of being a free republic\" is protecting the independence of the court and the legal profession so they don't become instruments of the person in power.",
      "\"Sometimes the times call for courage,\" Olson said. \"Are you recognizing that this is one of those times that the ordinary calculations aren't good enough, the calculations that would do against many ordinary sorts of danger? This is an extraordinary danger. Maybe it calls for extraordinary courage.\"",

      "Washington \u2014 President Trump has claimed his pick to serve as the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Lt. Gen. Dan Caine donned a MAGA hat as proof of loyalty, but Caine told the Senate Armed Services committee on Tuesday that never happened. Mr. Trump may have been speaking about someone else, Caine said.",
      "\"For 34 years, I've upheld my oath of office and the responsibilities of my commission,\" Caine said. \"I went back and listened to those tapes and I think the president was actually talking about somebody else and I've never worn any political merchandise or said anything to that effect.\"",
      "At the 2024 Conservative Political Action Committee conference, Mr. Trump recounted meeting Caine and a sergeant in Iraq. He then recounted that one of them said, \"'I love you, sir. I think you're great, sir. I'll kill for you, sir.'\" and then they put on Make America Great Again hats. \"You're not allowed to do that, but they did it.\"",
      "Caine told senators during his confirmation hearing that he has never worn a MAGA hat.",
      "Mr. Trump tapped Caine in the same social media post in which he fired Gen. Charles Q. Brown Jr. who was less than two years into his four-year term as the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.",
      "Caine is an unconventional pick in part because he retired last year and is a three-star general nominated to a role that requires previous service in a four star position such as one of the joint chiefs or combatant commanders. The president can waive this requirement, according to U.S. code.",
      "Mr. Trump, in announcing Caine's nomination said, \"Alongside Secretary Pete Hegseth, General Caine and our military will restore peace through strength, put America First, and rebuild our military.\"",
      "Caine faced questions throughout the hearing about the Signal chat in which Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth shared operational details about strikes in Yemen.",
      "\"We should always preserve, we should always preserve the element of surprise and that should translate across every information domain and format, and never put our war fighters, uh, in any harm's way,\" Caine said.",
      "He also said he has always put \"proper information in the proper channels\" during his career.",
      "When asked further about the chat, he said he wanted to withhold comment since the leaders of the Senate Armed Services Committee have requested an investigation into the signal chat.",
      "Before his nomination to be chairman, Caine most recently served as the director of special programs for the Pentagon's Special Access Program Central Office. As an F-16 pilot, he logged more than 2,800 hours, including more than 150 combat hours.",

      "Johnson said it halted further legislative action this week.",
      "\"Let me just make this clear, that rule being brought down means that we can't have any further action on the floor this week,\" Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, told reporters after the vote. \"It's very unfortunate. We'll regroup and come back.\"",
      "The fight over whether to allow remote voting for new moms and dads who serve in Congress came to a head this week with Rep. Anna Paulina Luna, a Florida Republican, leaving the conservative House Freedom Caucus as her colleagues plotted against the bipartisan measure.",
      "The measure, which was introduced by Democratic Rep. Brittany Pettersen of Colorado in January, would allow new parents to designate a colleague to vote for them for 12 weeks after they or their spouse gives birth. The bill would also allow that period to begin earlier if the lawmaker has a serious medical condition or isn't able to travel safely.",
      "But Johnson and other Republicans have opposed proxy voting, arguing that it's unconstitutional. Republicans claimed the measure would create a slippery slope for members to abuse the practice, despite it being narrowly tailored toward new and expectant parents.",

      "Republicans then sought to derail Luna's effort by inserting language into a rule governing debate on an unrelated bill on election security that would table her discharge petition.",
      "In a letter resigning from the House Freedom Caucus on Monday, Luna accused members of threatening Johnson with halting floor proceedings indefinitely unless her effort was blocked. She called the tactic \"a betrayal of trust.\"",
      "\"The speaker is being held hostage,\" Luna told reporters Monday.",
      "Luna has argued that allowing new parents to vote remotely is not unconstitutional because members voting by proxy would not count toward a quorum. Those against the practice have themselves voted by proxy during the pandemic, including Johnson, Luna noted.",
      "Democrats instituted proxy voting during the pandemic, but it was ended by Republicans when they regained the House majority in 2023.",
      "Pettersen introduced the bill in January weeks before she gave birth to her son in Colorado. The Democrat rushed back to Washington with her then-4-week-old son to vote on a budget resolution.",
      "On Tuesday, Pettersen bounced her fussy baby in her arms on the House floor as she urged her colleagues to support remote voting for new mothers.",
      "\"It is unfathomable that in 2025 we have not modernized Congress to address these very unique challenges that members face. These life events, where our voices should still be heard, our constituents should still be represented.\"",

The campaigns and their supporters have spent more than $81 million, attracting endorsements and campaign appearances from Elon Musk, Vermont Democratic Sen.

About a third of advance ballots so far have come from heavily Democratic counties of Milwaukee and Dane, in the Madison area, and that's roughly in line with their share of the advance vote in 2023.",
      "Nineteen percent of advance ballots have come from the WOW counties in the Milwaukee suburbs of Waukesha, Ozaukee, and Washington, which is a couple of points higher than their share in 2023.",

      "Earlier this month, President Trump signed an executive order calling for the agency, as well as six other governmental entities, to be reduced to \"the minimum presence.\" A few weeks ago, employees of the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, were spotted in the IMLS building in Washington, D.C., to attend the swearing in of the new acting commissioner, Deputy Labor Secretary Keith Sonderling.",
      "AFGE Local 3403, the union representing IMLS employees, said the notification to employees came after a \"brief meeting between DOGE staff and IMLS leadership.\" It said museums and libraries would no longer be able to contact IMLS staff for updates about their funding. The message also said the status of previously awarded grants is unclear, but that funding is likely to be terminated.",
      "IMLS has approximately 77 employees and was created by Congress as an independent federal agency in 1996 through the Museum and Library Services Act to support American museums and libraries. Last year, the institute awarded $267 million in grants across the country, with a focus on helping to organize book drives and museum field trips in areas without existing access to libraries or museums.",

The notice said email accounts would be disabled and instructs employees to leave laptops and work cellphones in the office, according to text of the email shared with CBS News.",
      "One employee said Sonderling's arrival at the agency seemed to signal that employees would soon be put on administrative leave. They have not been told what will happen to the agency, though one possibility entails shrinking the staff footprint to 30 employees and moving them to the Labor Department, according to the Federal News Network.",
      "A White House official said the restructuring \"is a necessary step\" to fulfill Mr. Trump's executive order and would ensure \"hard-earned tax dollars are not diverted to discriminatory DEI initiatives or divisive anti-American programming in our cultural institutions.\"",

      "Scholars say the files that President Trump ordered to be released showed nothing undercutting the conclusion that a lone gunman killed Kennedy, and the declassified versions did not appear to contain significant new revelations about the assassination, based on a review by CBS News. Many documents were previously released but contained newly removed redactions, including Social Security numbers, angering people whose personal information was disclosed.",
      "The first hearing of the House Task Force on the Declassification of Federal Secrets comes five decades after the Warren Commission investigation concluded that Lee Harvey Oswald, a 24-year-old former Marine, acted alone in fatally shooting Kennedy as his motorcade finished a parade route in downtown Dallas on Nov. 22, 1963.",
      "Republican Rep. Anna Paulina Luna of Florida, who chairs the task force, said last month that she wants to work with writers and researchers to help solve \"one of the biggest cold case files in U.S. history.\" Scholars and historians haven't viewed the assassination as a cold case, viewing the evidence for Oswald as a lone gunman as strong.",
      "Stone's \"JFK\" was nominated for eight Oscars, including best picture, and won two. It grossed more than $200 million but was also dogged by questions about its factuality.",
      "The last formal congressional investigation of Kennedy's assassination ended in 1978, when a House committee issued a report concluding that the Soviet Union, Cuba, organized crime, the CIA and the FBI weren't involved, but Kennedy \"probably was assassinated as a result of a conspiracy.\" In 1976, a Senate committee said it had not uncovered enough evidence \"to justify a conclusion that there was a conspiracy.\"",
      "The Warren Commission, appointed by Kennedy's successor, President Lyndon B. Johnson, concluded that Oswald fired on Kennedy's motorcade from a sniper's perch on the sixth floor of the Texas School Book Depository, where Oswald worked. Police arrested Oswald within 90 minutes, and two days later, Jack Ruby, a nightclub owner, shot Oswald during a jail transfer broadcast on live television.",
      "For Tuesday's hearing, the task force also invited Jefferson Morley and James DiEugenio, who both have written books arguing for conspiracies behind the assassination. Morley is editor of the JFK Facts blog and vice president of the Mary Ferrell Foundation, a repository for files related to the assassination. He has praised Luna as being open to new information surrounding the killing.",

    "story": [
      "A federal judge in California on Monday agreed to delay the Trump administration's move to terminate the Temporary Protected Status (TPS) program that currently shields roughly 350,000 Venezuelan migrants from deportation.",
      "Under a decision announced by Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem in February, these migrants were slated to lose their government-issued work permits and deportation protections next week, on April 7.",
      "But in a scathing decision on Monday, U.S. District Court Judge Edward Chen ruled in favor of TPS holders who filed a lawsuit against Noem's decision and postponed her action until he adjudicates the merits of the case.",
      "Chen called Noem's decision \"unprecedented,\" noting that the U.S. government had never before abruptly terminated a TPS program without a significant wind-down period. He said the move appeared to be \"predicated on negative stereotypes\" about Venezuelans, citing references in Noem's order about alleged gang members from Venezuela entering the U.S. and Venezuelan migrants straining resources in American communities.",
      "\"(T)he Court finds that the Secretary's action threatens to: inflict irreparable harm on hundreds of thousands of persons whose lives, families, and livelihoods will be severely disrupted, cost the United States billions in economic activity, and injure public health and safety in communities throughout the United States,\" Chen wrote in his ruling.",
      "The plaintiffs, Chen continued, are likely going to prevail in arguing that Noem's actions \"are unauthorized by law, arbitrary and capricious, and motivated by unconstitutional animus.\"",
      "CBS News has reached out to representatives for the Department of Homeland Security for comment on Monday's court order.",
      "Advocates for migrants praised the ruling, saying it would curb the Trump administration's plan to carry out the largest deportation campaign in American history.",
      "\"The Court's decision provides a crucial protection against mass deportations for a population that this administration has singled out for extreme vilification,\" said Ahilan Arulanantham, the co-director of the Center for Immigration Law and Policy at UCLA School of Law and one of the lawyers in the case being heard by Chen.",
      "Created by Congress in 1990, TPS allows the U.S. government to grant temporary immigration protections to migrants from nations beset by war, environmental disasters or other crises that make it dangerous to send deportees there. While it does not place beneficiaries on a path to permanent legal residency, TPS allows them to apply for renewable work permits and deportation deferrals.",
      "The Biden administration vastly increased the number of migrants eligible for TPS, creating or expanding programs for Afghanistan, Cameroon, Haiti, Ukraine, Venezuela and other countries. The Venezuela TPS program is the biggest of its kind, covering roughly 600,000 people through two separate designations in 2021 and 2023.",
      "Republicans have long criticized TPS programs, arguing they are often extended improperly and that they reward illegal immigration since some of those eligible for the policy are in the country without proper documents. On the first day of his second term, President Trump ordered officials to review TPS programs to ensure they are \"limited in scope.\"",
      "Less than two weeks after that order, Noem announced she was revoking the 2023 TPS designation for Venezuelans and undoing the Biden administration's last-minute extension of the program. While Noem acknowledged in her decision that some conditions in Venezuela cited by the Biden administration persist, she determined it was \"contrary to the national interest\" to continue the TPS policy.",
      "Venezuelans enrolled in TPS through the 2021 designation are slated to keep their status through at least September.",
      "When it first offered Venezuelans TPS in 2021, the Biden administration cited the political and economic turmoil in Venezuela under the regime of President Nicolas Maduro. Over the past years,\u00a0nearly 8 million people\u00a0have left Venezuela, settling in neighboring South American countries, the U.S. and other nations as part of the largest exodus ever recorded in the Western Hemisphere.",
      "Noem has also announced plans to start phasing out the TPS program for hundreds of thousands of Haitians, as early as this summer. Advocates have asked Chen to intervene and rule against that move, but the judge has yet to rule on that request.",

    "published": "Mon, 31 Mar 2025 19:17:00 -0400",
    "summary": "President Donald Trump again suggested he may try to run for a third term in office, despite limits set by the 12th and 22nd Amendments.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump has periodically floated the idea of serving a third term in office since his first reelection campaign and seemed to double down on it Sunday during an interview with NBC News, suggesting \"there are methods\" to do it despite term limits set by the 12th and 22nd Amendments in the U.S. Constitution.",
      "To date, Franklin D. Roosevelt is the only president in the history of the United States to serve more than two terms, ultimately sitting in office from 1933 to 1945, when he died shortly after beginning his fourth term. His third term was controversial, said Noah Rosenblum, a legal historian and constitutional law professor at New York University, noting that FDR's tenure broke from a precedent set by George Washington and drew accusations of dictatorial ambitions as well as a disrespect for democracy.",
      "\"There are very few norms as deeply embedded in American democratic culture as the idea that the president serves two terms,\" Rosenblum told CBS News. \"And clever word games to try to get around that are really nothing but attempts to undermine the clear text, spirit and intention of the Constitution and this historical process that ungirds it.\"",
      "Here's what to know about the amendments that regulate how long any one person can remain president.",
      "What is Trump saying about seeking a third term?",
      "Mr. Trump has mentioned staying in office after his current, second term ends on numerous occasions, stretching back to his first administration. On the campaign trail in 2020, he told attendees at a rally in Minden, Nevada, that he believed he would win that year's election against Joe Biden and went on to suggest he could take the White House for a third time afterward.",
      "\"We're going to win four more years in the White House. And then after that, we'll negotiate, right?\" Mr. Trump said at the time. \"Because we're probably, based on the way we were treated, we're probably entitled to another four after that.\" It was unclear at the time if Mr. Trump meant what he said, but the comments stoked national discourse about whether he would, or could, truly attempt to flout the two-term limit.",
      "Those questions began to crop up again after the president's recent remarks to NBC News, in which he said during a phone interview from Mar-a-Lago that he was \"not joking\" about trying to serve a third term in the White House.",
      "\"There are methods which you could do it,\" said Mr. Trump, although he added, \"It is far too early to think about it.\"",
      "When asked by NBC's Kristen Welker about a hypothetical scenario where Vice President JD Vance won the next election and handed the authority back to him, he said that could be one way to end up in office for a third time.",
      "\"But there are others, too. There are others,\" Mr. Trump continued, declining to elaborate when asked.",
      "What does the 22nd Amendment say, exactly?",
      "The opening line of the 22nd Amendment to the Constitution states: \"No person shall be elected to the office of the President more than twice, and no person who has held the office of President, or acted as President, for more than two years of a term to which some other person was elected President shall be elected to the office of the President more than once.\"",
      "The latter portion of that section means that if the vice president takes over the presidency if an elected president dies, for example, and serves in that role for more than half of the originally elected president's term, then they could only serve one more presidential term after that. The former restricts an individual to two four-year terms of service as president, applying to consecutive and non-consecutive terms.",
      "Addressing remarks by some, like constitutional law scholar Lawrence Tribe, who has observed that the amendment as written merely prevents a sitting president from being elected, but not serving, more than twice, Rosenblum said the language \"reinforces the intention of the amendment, which is not to prevent someone from being elected president twice, it's to make sure nobody serves more than two terms as president.\"",
      "\"The language of the 22nd Amendment is framed in terms of the language of 'election,' but the purpose of the amendment is clear,\" Rosenblum told CBS News. \"It's to ensure that the office of the president transfers and cycles as part of the democratic process.\"",
      "Why was the 22nd Amendment ratified?",
      "Congress proposed the 22nd Amendment in 1947 in response to critiques of FDR's presidency, which ended with Roosevelt's death in April 1945, a few months into his fourth term.",
      "The National Constitution Center notes that Republicans who had long opposed FDR found allies among some Democrats from the South and West to get the proposal passed through Congress and sent to the states for ratification. The 22nd Amendment was ratified in 1951.",
      "Harry Truman, who was Roosevelt's vice president, stepped in as president in 1945 and was subsequently elected to fulfill another term in office when that one concluded. Truman opted not to run again in 1952.",
      "What about the 12th Amendment?",
      "The 12th Amendment preceded the 22nd by well over a century but even then it included a provision about who is and is not eligible to run for president and vice president. This amendment was introduced by federal legislators in 1803 and ratified about six months later, in 1804, taking effect in time for the year's presidential election that saw Thomas Jefferson assume office.",
      "It primarily focuses on the processes through which the Electoral College votes to elect a U.S. president and vice president,\u00a0the National Constitution Center writes. However, the amendment also states that \"no person constitutionally ineligible to the office of President shall be eligible to that of Vice-President of the United States.\"",
      "That would mean Mr. Trump could not run for vice president on the ticket of another presidential candidate after finishing his second term in office if the 22nd Amendment's provisions prevent him from running for president.",
      "Is there a way Trump could serve a third term?",
      "Rosenblum said Mr. Trump's ability to serve a third term could come down to how the courts interpret the 12th and 22nd Amendments. He pointed out that even those committed to more literal application of the Constitution tend to interpret the language \"with an eye toward what the real purpose is.\"",
      "In this case, he said, that would be upholding the term limits it has laid out. Still, Rosenblum cautioned, \"a president who's interested in remaining in power, despite limits against it, will come up with clever legal arguments to do so.\"",
      "\"This is an administration that has repeatedly shown itself contemptuous of the rule of law,\" said Rosenblum. \"So, will Trump be able to violate the law and remain in office indefinitely? Only if the American people let him.\"",
      "Asked about Mr. Trump's comments and whether the president could get a third term, Senate Majority Leader John Thune said, \"Not without a change in the Constitution.\"",
      "He added, \"I think that you guys [reporters] keep asking the question and \u2026 I think he is having some fun with it, probably messing with you.\"",
      "Other legal scholars who have weighed in on the subject say they doubt Mr. Trump could manage to usurp the amendments and their long-held rules of law.",
      "\"I don't think there's any 'one weird trick' to getting around presidential term limits,\" Derek Muller, a professor of election law at Notre Dame, told the Associated Press.",
      "Muller suggested Mr. Trump has mentioned running for a third term \"to show as much strength as possible,\" adding that \"a lame-duck president like Donald Trump has every incentive in the world to make it seem like he's not a lame duck.\"",
      "All told, the question of Mr. Trump continuing as president past January 2029 is \"incredibly complicated,\" said Michael Dorf, a constitutional law scholar and Cornell University professor whose blog series, \"Wait, Can He Actually Do That?,\" analyzes the latest actions by the administration when one \"seemingly exceeds the president's authority.\"",
      "Dorf has identified two main reasons for the complexity.",
      "\"One, is that our system for electing presidents is complicated, even in normal times,\" he told CBS News. \"But it's also complicated because, ultimately, no legal system can work if people are acting in constant bad faith. There has to be some sort of willingness of people to accept defeat, or to give the law a sensible meaning. And Trump has shown repeatedly that if it disfavors him, he's going to ignore longstanding norms.\"",

      "Trump supporters like former strategist Steve Bannon have called on the president to run again, and Rep. Andy Ogles, a Tennessee Republican, introduced a resolution earlier this year to amend the Constitution to allow Mr. Trump to be elected to another term. Senate Majority Leader John Thune also said of Mr. Trump's prospects of serving a third term, \"not without a change in the Constitution.\" He told reporters, \"I think that you guys keep asking the question and \u2026 I think he is having some fun with it, probably messing with you.\"",
      "Experts say changing the Constitution is extremely unlikely. Election law scholars\u00a0raised the possibility that talk of a third term, whatever its likelihood, may function as a show of strength to try to stave off the perception that Mr. Trump is a lame-duck president.",
      "Here's a timeline of Mr. Trump's comments on a third term:",
      "\"We're probably entitled to another four after that\"",
      "Mr. Trump flirted with additional time in office beyond two terms when he sought reelection in 2020. During a rally in Minden, Nevada, the president predicted he would win four more years in the White House, and even suggested that he could go on to another term after his second.",
      "\"We're going to win four more years in the White House. And then after that, we'll negotiate, right?\" Mr. Trump said. \"Because we're probably, based on the way we were treated, we're probably entitled to another four after that.\"",
      "\"Am I allowed to run again?\"",
      "Shortly after returning to office, Mr. Trump again made reference to another term at a rally in Las Vegas on Jan. 25.",
      "\"It will be the greatest honor of my life to serve, not once but twice \u2014 or three times or four times,\" Mr. Trump quipped to applause from the crowd, before adding that \"no, it will be to serve twice.\"",
      "Then on Jan. 27, Mr. Trump joked to Republican lawmakers about a third term. Speaking before the House GOP conference in Florida, Mr. Trump touted the money he'd raised for another race that he said \"I assume I can't use for myself.\"",
      "\"But I'm not 100% sure because, I don't know,\" the president continued, to laughter from House Republicans. \"I think I'm not allowed to run again. I'm not sure. Am I allowed to run again?\"",
      "\"Should I run again? You tell me.\"",
      "At the National Prayer Breakfast on Feb. 6, Mr. Trump said, \"They say I can't run again \u2014 that's the expression.\"",
      "\"Then somebody said, 'I don't think you can.' Oh,\" the president added.",
      "On Feb. 20, the president again joked about an additional term at a White House event to mark Black History Month, as he celebrated the support he saw from Black Americans in the 2024 election.",
      "\"Should I run again? You tell me,\" Mr. Trump said, as supporters chanted, \"four more years!\"",
      "\"There are methods\"",
      "In an interview with NBC's Kristen Welker on March 30, Mr. Trump said, \"I'm not joking\" about serving a third term, and for the first time mentioned an awareness of potential paths.",
      "\"There are methods which you could do it,\" Mr. Trump said in a phone interview, adding that \"it is far too early to think about it.\"",
      "The president pointed to his favorability rating and suggested that Americans would like him to serve a third term. Mr. Trump told Welker, \"I have had more people say, 'please run again,'\" while noting \"we have a long way to go before we even think about that.\" On Air Force One Sunday night, he\u00a0spoke\u00a0with reporters and briefly addressed questions about a third term and reiterated that it's still a distant consideration.",
      "\"No matter how you look at it, we've got a long time to go. We have a long time. You know, we have almost four years to go,\" Mr. Trump told reporters. \"But despite that, so many people are saying, 'you've got to run again.' They love the job.\"",
      "While speaking to reporters on Monday in the Oval Office, Mr. Trump denied that he has ever looked into running for another term.",
      "\"People are asking me to run,\" he said. \"There's a whole story about running for a third term. I don't know. I never looked into it. They do say there's a way you can do it. But I don't know about that. But I have not looked into it.\"",
      "Mr. Trump was also asked whether it would open the door to Democrats running former President Barack Obama, who served two consecutive terms, against him.",

      "\"Although the possibility of direct negotiations between the two sides has been rejected in this response, it has been emphasized that the path for indirect negotiations remains open,\" Pezeshkian said, adding Iran's response was delivered via the sultanate of Oman.",
      "It's unclear, however, whether Mr. Trump would accept indirect negotiations. Indirect negotiations have been unsuccessful for years since Mr. Trump initially withdrew the U.S. from Tehran's nuclear deal with world powers in 2018.",
      "The White House offered no immediate reaction to the announcement.",
      "Mr. Trump revealed in an interview with Fox News Channel's \"Sunday Morning Futures\" earlier this month that he had sent a letter to Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei urging him to negotiate and warning of potential military action if it refused.",
      "\"I would rather negotiate a deal. I'm not sure that everybody agrees with me, but we can make a deal that would be just as good as if you won militarily,\" Mr. Trump said. \"But the time is happening now. The time is coming up. Something's going to happen one way or the other. I hope that Iran \u2014 and I've written him a letter, saying, 'I hope you're going to negotiate.' Because if we have to go in militarily, it's going to be a terrible thing \u2014 for them.\"",
      "On Sunday, in an interview with NBC News taped before Pezeshkian's comments, Mr. Trump reiterated that he is considering military action and secondary tariffs if Iran does not agree to a nuclear deal.",
      "\"If they don't make a deal, there will be bombing and it will be bombing the likes of which they have never seen before,\" he said.",
      "Mr. Trump's overture comes as both Israel and the U.S. have warned they will never let Iran acquire a nuclear weapon, leading to fears of a military confrontation as Tehran enriches uranium at near weapons-grade levels \u2013 something only done by atomic-armed nations.",
      "Iran has long maintained its program is for peaceful purposes, even as its officials increasingly threaten to pursue the bomb as tensions are high with the U.S. over its sanctions and after the collapse of a ceasefire in Israel's\u00a0war against Hamas in the Gaza Strip.",
      "As the U.S. conducts intense airstrikes targeting the Iranian-backed Houthi rebels of Yemen, the risk of military action targeting Iran's nuclear program remains on the table.",
      "A\u00a0report last month\u00a0by the United Nations nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency, said Iran had \"significantly increased production and accumulation of high enriched uranium.\"",
      "Last week, Khamenei warned that U.S. threats against his country \"will get them nowhere,\" adding that Americans \"and others should know that if they do anything malign to the Iranian nation, they will get a hard slap.\"",
      "He had previously\u00a0dismissed Mr. Trump's overtures\u00a0for talks, accusing the U.S. president of attempting to deceive global public opinion by portraying the United States as willing to negotiate and Iran as unwilling to engage.",
      "Mr. Trump's first term in office was marked by a particularly troubled period in relations with Tehran. In 2018, he unilaterally withdrew the United States from Iran's nuclear deal with world powers, leading to sanctions hobbling Iran's economy. Iran retaliated with attacks at sea \u2014 including one that it likely carried out and that temporarily halved Saudi Arabia's oil production.",
      "Trump also ordered the attack that killed Iran's top general in a Baghdad drone strike in January 2020.",

      "After dropping off the first stage for a successful droneship landing, the rocket's upper stage shut down 10 minutes after liftoff and the Crew Dragon was released to fly on its own. It is expected to fly over the North and South Poles 55 times between Monday night and splashdown Friday in the Pacific Ocean.",
      "\"On behalf of the SpaceX team, we're honored to deliver you safely to your polar orbit,\" radioed Bill Gerstenmaier, NASA's former director of space operations and now a senior manager at SpaceX. \"Enjoy the views of the poles, send us some pictures.

      "Who are the private adventurers on the Fram2 mission?",
      "Chun Wang, a Chinese-born citizen of Malta who lives mostly in the extreme north of Norway, paid SpaceX an undisclosed amount to charter the Crew Dragon \"Resilience\" for a trip in polar orbit. The deal marks SpaceX's third privately funded civilian space tourism flight.",
      "\"My own journey has been shaped by lifelong curiosity and a fascination with pushing boundaries,\" Chun (pronounced choon) told reporters Friday. \"As a kid, I used to stare at a blank white space at the bottom of a world map and wonder what's out there.",
      "\"Curiosity eventually took me across the continent and to the southern most tip of Earth in 2021, and also the North Pole in 2023, and now, soon, into space.\" The flight, he added, \"isn't just about going to space. It's about pushing boundaries, sharing knowledge ... and we hope our mission will further inspire later people to do the same.\"",
      "Chun named the mission after the 19th century sailing ship Fram \u2014 \"forward\" in Norwegian \u2014 that carried arctic pioneers to the polar regions in the 1800s. A small piece of Fram's teak decking was carried into space aboard the Crew Dragon.",
      "\"Pretty wild to see the Fram adventurers sailing to the poles once again, over 130 years from (the original ship's) christening,\" SpaceX's launch director radioed the crew. \"This time, though, with Starlink. Cheers.\"",
      "A veteran world traveler, Chun offered the Crew Dragon's three other seats to a trio of explorers he met during a recent polar trip. Jannicke Mikkelsen, a Norwegian cinematographer, is the designated vehicle commander, joined by German roboticist Rabea Rogge as the mission pilot.",
      "The fourth member of the crew is Australian Eric Philips, a professional polar tour guide, adventurer and veteran of some 30 trips to the North and South poles. He is serving as the crew's medical officer.",
      "Some might view the crew as seasoned adventurers and now, space tourists. In an interview with CBS News, Mikkelsen made it clear the crew is well qualified, but she said \"space tourists\" doesn't reflect the extensive training required by SpaceX.",
      "\"I wish it was tourism,\" she said. \"But our education has lasted well over a year, so I have never studied so hard for a three-and-a-half-day expedition in my life.\"",
      "History of private space flights",
      "Chun said he was inspired to book the mission by the example set by entrepreneur Jared Isaacman, the billionaire who chartered SpaceX's first two fully commercial missions, and fellow billionaire Yusaku Maezawa, who flew to the International Space Station aboard a Russian Soyuz spacecraft.",
      "\"I owe my inspiration to Jared,\" Chun posted on X. \"If it weren't for @yousuckMZ and @rookisaacman taking the first step, I would have never had the courage to book an entire spaceship and bring along three people I had only met once before. I also copied many good practices from his previous missions \u2014 hope he doesn't mind.\"",
      "Isaacman, who owns and flies a Russian fighter jet, is the Trump administration's nominee to serve as NASA's next administrator.",
      "Unlike Isaacman, no one on the Fram2 mission is a licensed pilot. While Blue Origin has launched non-pilot crews to the edge of space in sub-orbital New Shepard flights, no crew has flown to orbit without at least one crew member with aviation expertise or astronaut experience.",
      "SpaceX says Fram2 will help refine training procedures aimed at opening up spaceflight to more and more non-professionals.",
      "\"As a roboticist, I'm so hyped about Dragon being an autonomous vehicle which really, I think, shows you how much times are changing in the space sector,\" Rogge said. \"We are really at a crucial point in time where the spacecraft does so many of the tasks itself.",
      "\"I think that really spearheads the accessibility to space, right? Because the dream is (to) have many people in space if we want to live and work there as a civilization.\"",

      "Plans for orbiting around the poles",
      "The crew plans to carry out 22 experiments during the flight, ranging from filming auroral displays from orbit to testing compact exercise equipment for use in smaller spacecraft, growing oyster mushrooms in microgravity and taking the first X-rays in space.",
      "Along with three high-end professional cameras, the crew is equipped with four iPad Minis, two iPhone Pro Max cellphones, three laptop computers, a ham radio \"and even an X-ray generator, which we'll use to capture the first-ever X-ray image of the human body in space \u2014 something crucial for future long-duration missions to Mars and beyond,\" Chun posted on X.",
      "Also on board: a Starlink laser terminal mounted in the Crew Dragon's lower trunk section that will give the crew, in theory, data relay speeds of up to 100 gigabytes per second or better.",
      "To reach the planned orbit around the poles, one tilted 90 degrees to Earth's equator, the flight plan called for the Falcon 9 to follow a due-south trajectory carrying the crew above southern Florida, Cuba and Panama on the way to space. The 273-mile-high orbit will allow 55 passes above the poles between launch and splashdown.",
      "Jon Edwards, a SpaceX vice president who oversee Falcon 9 flight operations, said the Crew Dragon's flight software was modified to ensure the vehicle passes safely over populated areas, guiding the rocket as needed to keep the capsule or other components well away from any populated areas in an emergency.",
      "\"We're going to fly out of 39A in Florida and go pretty much straight south,\" Edwards said. \"In fact, the flight path is going to go over Florida. If you were in Miami and you looked straight up, you know, at the right time. would see the rocket and the crew flying right overhead.",
      "\"What we call the instantaneous impact points, which is where, if we cut power, it would land, that will stay offshore, so it's totally safe to do this. But it will be flying over Florida and over Cuba and Panama and just to the west of Peru and Ecuador.\"",
      "NASA and the U.S. Space Force routinely launch military satellites and science probes into polar orbits from Vandenberg Space Force Base in California, where rockets can fly due south over the Pacific Ocean without passing over populated areas.",
      "But the maximum inclination for orbital payloads launched from the East Coast has traditionally been limited to avoid flying over areas where debris from a catastrophic failure might fall. In recent years, SpaceX has launched satellites into polar or near-polar orbits from Cape Canaveral, but no piloted flights.",
      "While NASA and the Air Force once planned to launch space shuttles into polar orbit from Vandenberg, the military space program changed priorities in the wake of the 1986 Challenge disaster and those plans were shelved six months before the initial flight.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/stuck-astronauts-speak-out-after-return/",
    "published": "Mon, 31 Mar 2025 20:30:56 -0400",
    "summary": "NASA astronauts Butch Wilmore and Sunita Williams, who were stuck in space for more than nine months, took questions after returning to Earth.",
    "story": [
      "Starliner astronauts Butch Wilmore and Sunita Williams, speaking out at a news conference for the first time since returning to Earth after an extended 286-day stay in space, said Monday they did not blame Boeing for the spacecraft problems that effectively stranded them aboard the International Space Station.",
      "In fact, asked if he would fly again aboard the Starliner, Wilmore said, \"Yes, because we're going to rectify all the issues that we encountered. We're going to fix them. We're going to make it work. Boeing is completely committed. NASA is completely committed, and with that, I'd get on in a heartbeat.\"",
      "Added Williams: \"I would agree. The spacecraft is really capable. There were a couple things that need to be fixed ... and folks are actively working on that, but it is a great spacecraft, and it has a lot of capability that other spacecraft don't have. To see that thing successful and to be part of that program is an honor.\"",
      "Asked if he blamed Boeing for the propulsion system helium leaks and thruster problems that ultimately led NASA to bring the Starliner down without its crew, extending their stay aboard the space station from eight days to more than nine-and-a-half months, Wilmore said, \"That is a question that I cannot answer in a couple of comments. But I'll start with me.\"",
      "\"There were questions that I, as the commander of the spacecraft, that I should have asked, and I did not. At the time, I didn't know I needed to. And maybe you could call that hindsight, but I'll start and point the finger and I'll blame me. I could have asked some questions and the answers to those questions could have turned the tide.",
      "\"So blame, I don't like that term, but certainly there's responsibility throughout all the programs and certainly you can start with me. Responsibility with Boeing? Yes. Responsibility with NASA? Yes. All the way up and down the chain. We all are responsible. We all own this.\"",
      "Their repeatedly extended mission generated enormous attention in the wake of problems with Starliner, NASA's decision three months after launch to keep them in orbit until this year, and comments from President Trump claiming the astronauts had been \"abandoned\" in space by the Biden administration.",
      "Williams denied feeling \"abandoned\" or \"stuck\" during an interview with CBS News in February, saying she was \"honored ... to be here and a part of the team\" doing \"world-class science.\" They said much of the same Monday. But they avoided answering questions about the political aspects of the mission.",
      "Wilmore and Williams returned to Earth on March 18, accompanied by two outgoing station fliers who were wrapping up their own six-month stay aboard the lab. The Starliner astronauts, like all returning station fliers, began physical therapy back at the Johnson Space Center to help them readjust to gravity.",
      "They both looked fit and were in obviously good spirits talking with reporters Monday. In fact, Williams said she went for a 3-mile run on Sunday.",
      "How long were the astronauts stuck in space?",
      "By the time they splashed down off Florida's Gulf Coast, Wilmore and Williams had spent 286 days in space.",
      "While the extended mission was much longer than originally planned, it ranks sixth on the list of longest flights by U.S. astronauts.",
      "The record is held by astronaut Frank Rubio, whose planned six-month stay aboard the space station was extended to just over a full year \u2014 371 days \u2014 because of coolant leaks in the Russian Soyuz that carried him to orbit. He came back to Earth aboard a replacement Soyuz in September 2023.",
      "Even though his record remains unbroken, problems with the Boeing Starliner that carried Wilmore and Williams to space triggered extensive coverage in the United States that far exceeded the coverage of Rubio's even longer mission.",
      "Why were the astronauts stuck in space so long?",
      "Three years after the space shuttle's retirement in 2011, NASA awarded multibillion-dollar contracts to Boeing and SpaceX to build ferry ships to carry astronauts to and from the space station. SpaceX has now launched 11 piloted Crew Dragon flights for NASA and five purely commercial missions. A sixth commercial launch is currently scheduled for Monday night.",
      "But Boeing ran into multiple problems with its Starliner that required two unpiloted test flights before Wilmore, who is 62, and Williams, 59, both former military test pilots, were finally cleared to launch last June 5 on the spacecraft's first piloted mission after engineers decided a small helium leak in the ship's propulsion pressurization system would not get worse.",
      "The astronauts successfully docked with the space station the next day, but the Starliner experienced additional helium propulsion system leaks and several maneuvering jets did not produce the expected thrust.",
      "While the flight originally was expected to last about eight days, NASA and Boeing carried out weeks of tests and analysis to determine what caused the problems and whether the spacecraft could be trusted to safely bring its crew back to Earth.",
      "By August, Boeing managers were convinced engineers understood the problems and the crew could, in fact, safely come home in the Starliner.",
      "But NASA managers eventually ruled out that option and decided to keep the astronauts aboard the station until early this year when they could hitch a ride home aboard a Crew Dragon. That spacecraft was launched last September with just two crew members on board, along with two empty seats for Wilmore and Williams.",
      "The Starliner, meanwhile, successfully returned to Earth earlier in September, kicking off hands-on troubleshooting and ongoing work to prepare for the eventual resumption of flights.",
      "Wilmore, Williams, Crew 9 Dragon commander Nick Hague and cosmonaut Alexander Gorbunov originally planned to return to Earth in February. But the Crew 10 Dragon needed to carry their replacements to the station ran into problems of its own and the flight was delayed to the end of March.",
      "Those problems, and the threat of additional delays, prompted NASA to switch the Crew 10 fliers to a different Crew Dragon, eventually moving its launch up to March 12, paving the way for Crew 9 to head home.",

      "The unmanned Spectrum rocket, an orbital rocket developed by German start-up Isar Aerospace, started smoking from its sides and then crashed back to Earth with a powerful explosion after launching from Norway's Andoya Spaceport in the Arctic. The company called the test flight a success.",
      "\"Our first test flight met all our expectations, achieving a great success,\" Daniel Metzler, Isar's chief executive and co-founder, said in a news release. \"We had a clean liftoff, 30 seconds of flight and even got to validate our Flight Termination System.\"",

    "story": [
      "Top Democrats on the House Science, Space and Technology Committee are sounding the alarm about cuts to a little-known but rapidly expanding space office within NOAA as part of the hundreds of recent layoffs at the agency.",
      "NOAA's Office of Space Commerce is tasked with helping to manage commercial and military satellite traffic in space to help guard against collisions, as well as licensing and regulating commercial satellite systems. The office has recently gotten attention around Washington as a key government office for commercial space companies.",
      "Its already small team lost eight employees in the initial round of layoffs in late February, representing around 30% of its staff, according to multiple sources. Since then, three staffers in leadership roles were brought back, but lawmakers still worry about the impact.",
      "The members of Congress are calling for all fired employees within the office to be reinstated permanently. Earlier this month, fired employees were placed on administrative leave after their firings were blocked by a federal court ruling.",
      "In a letter to Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, obtained by CBS News, lawmakers including the committee's ranking member Zoe Lofgren, of California, say the firings could compromise the office's public safety programs and risk hurting U.S. leadership in space.",
      "They also question whether there's a conflict of interest given Trump adviser and DOGE leader Elon Musk's stake in SpaceX.",
      "\"If OSC is gutted, the harm to America's economy, its national security, and its public safety will leave everyone worse off \u2014 except perhaps for SpaceX, whose size and scale will allow it to mitigate the damage done to the rest of the commercial space sector,\" reads the letter in part.",
      "\"As the largest and most profitable commercial satellite operator, SpaceX has already achieved a size and scale that far surpasses its competitors, thereby positioning the company to withstand market disruptions and uncertainty with much greater ease than its less-established rivals,\" it continues.",
      "In addition to Lofgren, the letter is signed by Democratic House members Valerie Foushee, of North Carolina, the ranking member of the Subcommittee on Space and Aeronautics; and Emilia Sykes, of Ohio, the ranking member of the subcommittee on Investigations & Oversight.",
      "Former NOAA officials also say the steep cuts to the office appear to be at odds with policy goals set out under the first Trump administration to help manage increasing commercial and civil space traffic.",
      "Admiral Timothy Gallaudet, who served as acting administrator of NOAA during the first Trump administration, called the cuts \"self-defeating,\" since the office was established to help support a growing commercial space sector. Gallaudet now works as a consultant for space companies.",
      "\"One of our goals, broadly, was to support these growing tech industries. One of them was space, and we grew,\" Gallaudet told CBS News. \"If that office has employees fired, that means it's going to take more time for them to issue licenses to new companies.\"",
      "Project 2025, the Heritage Foundation's conservative policy playbook, even called for Republicans to \"elevate\" the Office of Space Commerce, saying the office \"should be the vehicle for a new Administration to set a robust and unified whole-of-government commercial space policy that cements U.S. leadership in one of the most crucial industries of the future.\"",
      "One of the employees who remains on leave, Cole Donovan, served as an international affairs specialist within the Office of Space Commerce. His work focused on regulations and coordination between private space companies in the United States and the European Union.",
      "\"For my division, specifically, we don't have an expert anymore on EU law and EU regulation,\" he said. \"We had been helping U.S. companies navigate that process.\"",
      "Committee Democrats have asked Secretary Lutnick whether impacts to the U.S. space industry were assessed before the firings took place. They also asked whether any communications occurred between SpaceX representatives and officials from the Department of Commerce, NOAA or the Office of Space Commerce.",
      "The lawmakers also want to know whether the Office of Space Commerce will be compelled to grant DOGE access to proprietary data from SpaceX competitors that could potentially be disclosed to Musk and SpaceX.",
      "\"These unprecedented conflicts of interest threaten to destabilize the entire U.S. commercial space sector if they are not immediately addressed,\" they write in the letter.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014\u00a0Democratic Sen. Cory Booker delivered a record-breaking marathon speech on the Senate floor, which started Monday evening and continued more than 25 hours before wrapping up Tuesday night, in a protest against the Trump administration's policies.",
      "The speech now marks the longest on Senate record, surpassing Sen. Strom Thurmond's 24 hour and 18 minute address in 1957.",
      "While many senators have historically used long speeches to filibuster a bill or nomination, Booker's speech was not a filibuster since it did not occur during debate on a specific measure to block proceedings.",
      "Booker, a 55-year-old who first came to the Senate in 2013 and is now the fourth-ranking Democrat, began speaking around 7 p.m. on Monday and said he would continue speaking \"for as long as I am physically able.\" As the sun rose on Tuesday morning and then throughout the day, he was still speaking from the Senate floor.",
      "He passed the record-breaking mark at 7:19 p.m. ET, but kept on going, finally yielding the floor at 8:05 p.m.",
      "The Senate chamber erupted in applause as Booker broke the record, as Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer rose to mark the moment.",
      "\"Do you know how proud this caucus is of you, do you know how proud America is of you?\" Schumer said.",
      "Booker cited the legacy of leaders, like late congressman and civil rights activist John Lewis, whom he said stood up \"when this country was facing crossroads, was facing crises, they stood up.\"",
      "\"I rise today in an unusual manner,\" Booker said, before invoking Lewis' refrain to \"get in good trouble, necessary trouble, help redeem the soul of America.\"",
      "\"Tonight, I rise with the intention of getting in some good trouble,\" Booker said at the outset, pledging to disrupt the normal business of the Senate. \"I rise tonight because I believe sincerely that our country is in crisis\u2026 These are not normal times in America, and they should not be treated as such.\"",
      "More than 24 hours later, Booker was still speaking.",
      "The New Jersey Democrat spent some of that time reading letters from constituents who say they have been harmed by the Trump administration's policies, and condemning the administration more broadly \u2014 from trade wars to mass firings to deportations and threats to Medicaid.",
      "Booker occasionally yielded to his Democratic colleagues on the floor, including Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York and Senators Lisa Blunt Rochester of Delaware, Andy Kim of New Jersey, Peter Welch of Vermont, Dick Durbin of Illinois and Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, as they echoed his concerns with the administration and encouraged his effort. Still, Booker was not permitted to leave the Senate floor without risking control and continuation of his speech.",
      "After 7 a.m. Tuesday, Booker acknowledged the 12 hours that had passed, saying he was \"wide awake\" and would \"stand here for as many hours as I can.\" At noon, the Senate briefly paused for the chaplain to say a prayer, as is required under Senate rules during a continuous session. Booker continued to hold the floor.",
      "Asked by Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse how he was doing after the 17-hour mark, Booker said, \"I shall not complain.\"",
      "About 23 hours in, he joked, \"I, first amongst us all, really love to speak.\"",
      "As he approached the record, Booker thanked Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut for standing by him during nearly the entirety of the speech, while recalling Murphy's filibuster in 2016.",
      "\"You stood, and I stood with you,\" Booker said. \"And he said to me days ago, 'if you're going to do this, brother, I will your aide-de-camp this time.'\"",
      "Murphy marked the historic moment, noting that the previous record was set when Thurmond was fighting against civil rights and making the case for \"why this nation should continue to segregate Black and White.\"",
      "\"What you have done here today Sen. Booker couldn't be more different than what occurred on this floor in 1957,\" Murphy said. \"Today you are standing in the way not of progress, but of retreat.\"",
      "At the 24-hour mark, Booker brought his message back to Lewis and the \"good trouble\" that he invoked on Monday.",
      "\"This is the moment, generations get them, we're at a crossroads here, folks,\" Booker said, minutes before the record-breaking moment.",
      "Several members of the Congressional Black Caucus and other House members came to the floor at various intervals to observe the Senator's speech in the rear of the chamber, including Reps. Steven Horsford, Maxine Waters, Jonathan Jackson, Bonnie Watson Coleman, Sean Casten, Steve Cohen.",
      "Booker appeared to grow emotional as he surpassed Thurmond's record, saying he was not here because of Thurman's speech, but \"despite his speech.\"",
      "\"I'm here because as powerful as he was, the people were more powerful.\"",
      "What was the longest floor speech in Senate history?",
      "Prior to Booker's new record today, Sen. Strom Thurmond of South Carolina delivered the longest Senate speech on record, with a more than 24-hour filibuster in 1957. Thurmond carried out his filibuster in an effort to block civil rights legislation.",

      "CBS News is tracking the already sharply rising cost of products most impacted by tariffs imposed and soon-to-be-imposed by President Trump, from the cost of common grocery items to the the purchase and operation of cars and trucks.",
      "As new tariffs are set to be rolled out as early as April 2, we will continue updating the weekly prices of groceries and the monthly costs of new vehicles, used vehicles, parts, repairs, insurance premiums and construction and manufacturing raw materials.",
      "Economists and other experts say consumers can expect\u00a0to see higher prices for imported items targeted by the latest round of tariffs in the coming weeks and months.",
      "Groceries",
      "Perhaps the most impacted day-to-day purchases for American families will be at the grocery store, where a large share of our most commonly purchased fruits and vegetables are imported from Mexico, Canada, China and other countries facing tariffs. Experts suggest the cost of those tariffs will be passed on to consumers in the grocery checkout lane.",
      "We examined the prices for fruits, vegetables and juices that are primarily imported from other countries, according to USDA data. The average prices are drawn from weekly surveys that the Agriculture Department conducts at hundreds of stores across the country. We've tracked the weekly price data from 2020 through last week.",
      "Cars and trucks",
      "The cost of owning and operating a car or truck in the United States is a major focus ahead of the threatened White House tariffs on vehicles manufactured in other countries \u2014 a change experts predict will add thousands more to the cost of ownership, parts, repairs and insurance.",
      "In the wake of the COVID pandemic, supply-chain interruptions and the inflation that followed, the price of buying new and used cars rose sharply. So did the cost of parts, repairs and insurance.",
      "The charts show the price as an index \u2014 the percentage above a baseline. For new and used vehicles, we're using an example of a small SUV to translate the percentages into dollars to explain the recent years' change.",
      "Used car prices spiked after the COVID pandemic because major supply chain disruptions and a global computer chip shortage severely slowed down new vehicle production. In some cases, late-model used vehicle prices soared to nearly the same as new models of the same or similar vehicles.",
      "Some of the same phenomenon drove up the price of auto parts, and consequently, consumers' bills at repair shops.",
      "In addition to the rising cost of repairs, labor shortages, driving habits and increasing crash trends have driven up the cost of automobile insurance premiums, aggravating the total cost of owning and operating personal cars and trucks.",
      "Construction and manufacturing supplies",
      "Baked into the cost of everything from homebuilding to the manufacture of durable goods like appliances are the cost of core supplies like steel and aluminum, which is also targeted by the administration's tariffs.",

    "summary": "Experts estimate far lower figures in tariffs revenue, warning that President Trump's tariffs could drive up prices for American consumers.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump has argued that some of the tariffs he's imposing this week could help the government raise over $1 trillion in the next year or so, helping to reduce the national debt and even potentially offset some income taxes.",
      "But economists are skeptical that these tariffs can bring in as much as Mr. Trump claims, as consumers will likely reduce their spending on foreign goods when prices go up.",
      "Tariffs are often charged as a percentage of the price that importers pay foreign sellers. They aren't paid by foreign nations, but by U.S. companies who often pass the cost to American consumers by raising prices.",
      "\"You're going to see billions of dollars, even trillions of dollars coming into our country very soon in the form of tariffs,\" the president said last week.",
      "While economic analyses indicate Mr. Trump's tariffs could meaningfully increase annual tariff revenue, the president's trillion-dollar estimates are significantly higher than those provided by think tanks and even some of his own officials.",
      "How much Trump's new auto tariffs could generate",
      "In a recent news conference, White House staff secretary Will Sharf estimated that Mr. Trump's 25% tariff on vehicles and auto parts imported into the U.S. could raise \"roughly $100 billion in new revenue.\" At the same news conference, Mr. Trump claimed moments later \"anywhere from $600 billion to $1 trillion will be taken in over the relatively short-term period, meaning a year from now.\"",
      "The White House did not respond to a request to clarify the source of the discrepancy.",
      "The Yale Budget Lab, a nonpartisan think tank, has estimated that the auto tariffs could raise roughly $600 billion to $650 billion over a period of 10 years \u2014 not in a single year, as Mr. Trump suggested.",
      "\"On an annual basis on average that's $60 to 65 billion. We're not even close to trillions,\" said Ernie Tedeschi, director of economics at the Yale Budget Lab.",
      "The Yale Budget Lab also found that motor vehicle prices could rise by 13.5% on average for Americans, or an additional cost of $6,400 for an average new car.",
      "How much Trump's tariffs on Canada, Mexico, and China could generate",
      "The same researchers found Mr. Trump's 25% tariff on goods from Canada and Mexico, which are slated to go into effect this week, along with the additional 20% tax on Chinese imports that the president has already put in place, could generate roughly $150 billion annually, or up to $1.5 trillion over 10 years. They also found the average household could lose $1,600 to $2,000 each year in inflation-adjusted disposable income as a result of higher prices.",
      "Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs previously made higher estimates that Trump's increased tariffs on these countries could generate roughly $300 billion in new income per year.",
      "Either would be a meaningful increase over the $88 billion in customs duties collected at ports of entry in 2024.",
      "However, economists argue there's a ceiling to tariff revenue that remains below $1 trillion per year.",
      "The U.S. imported about $3.3 trillion in foreign goods last year, according to the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis. The Peterson Institute of International Economics estimated that even if Mr. Trump were to apply a 50% tariff to foreign imports from every country \u2014 which exceeds his stated plans \u2014 it would generate at most about $780 billion annually.",
      "\"If you make something 50% more expensive, you don't expect people to buy the same amount,\" said Kimberly Clausing, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute.",
      "Could tariff revenue replace income taxes?",
      "Mr. Trump has repeatedly floated the idea of using his tariff agenda to offset or even replace income taxes.",
      "\"Under the American first economic model, as tariffs on other countries go up, taxes on American workers and businesses will come down,\" Trump said in a speech to the House GOP in January.",
      "Income taxes generate over $2 trillion per year, according to the Department of the Treasury. Even if a president imposed 50% tariffs on all imports, the income generated would represent less than 40% of what income taxes bring in, according to the Peterson Institute.",
      "\"The problem is it can't raise anywhere near the amount of revenue you'd need to scuttle the income tax. And that's the really, I think, ironclad point,\" said Scott Lincicome, a vice president of general economics and trade at the Cato Institute, which is a libertarian think tank.",
      "Historians on U.S. trade note that tariffs have not been viewed as a primary way to raise revenue since income taxes were introduced in 1913.",
      "In 2024, tariff collections on imports represented just 1.7% of the more than $4.9 trillion in total federal revenue. And according to the Congressional Research Service, tariffs have not accounted for much more than 2% of federal revenue in the last 70 years.",

    "published": "Tue, 01 Apr 2025 20:13:00 -0400",
    "summary": "President Trump is expected on April 2 to announce reciprocal tariffs on a number of other countries. Here's what to know about these import taxes.",
    "story": [
      "A core element of the protectionist trade policies President Trump is scheduled to announce on Wednesday \u2014 a planned import tax blitz he has referred to as \"Liberation Day\" \u2014 are so-called reciprocal tariffs. Mr. Trump has touted such levies as a way to level the playing field with other countries that impose higher tariffs on U.S. imports, as well as to boost domestic manufacturers.",
      "But some economists say that tit-for-tat tariffs with key trading partners could be hard to structure, while also roiling global commerce and driving up costs\u00a0for U.S. consumers and businesses. Here's what to know about reciprocal tariffs.",
      "What are reciprocal tariffs?",
      "Truly reciprocal tariffs would impose the same tax on U.S. imports that other countries charge on American exports on a product by product basis. For example, if a country imposed a 6% levy on American-made shoes, Mr. Trump would tax that nation's footwear at the same rate.",
      "Currently, the U.S. and its trading partners charge each other different levies on the same products. Germany, for instance, puts higher tariffs on vehicles made in the U.S. than what Washington, D.C., charges on German vehicle imports.",
      "\"Reciprocal means that if a country has higher tariffs than we do on certain products, we would raise it to that level,\" Alex Jacquez, chief of policy and advocacy at Groundwork Collaborative, a left-leaning public policy think tank, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "That would be administratively complex given the tens of thousands of codes that determine the tariff rates on a variety of products.",
      "\"Setting up reciprocal tariffs across every product category with every trade partner would be completely infeasible with our administrative capacity,\" Jacquez said.",
      "Are reciprocal tariffs the same as country-based tariffs?",
      "Rather than impose perfectly reciprocal tariffs, the White House could instead announce country-specific tariff rates calibrated to the their trade imbalance with the U.S.",
      "\"They will probably come up with a blended rate that is not reciprocal by product, but is reciprocal by saying their tariffs are 10% higher than ours on average, so we'll be imposing 10% tariff across-the-board on all goods,\" said Jacquez, who formerly worked as an economic policy analyst in the Biden administration.",
      "That approach could result in the U.S. taxing other nations' products at vastly different rate than they do ours.",
      "\"It will hit a lot of products very differently in a proximate way, because it would be balanced by country but not by import or export,\" Jacquez said. \"That is where complications will arise, and you could see a scenario in which countries retaliate against us.\"",
      "Who are the \"Dirty 15\"?",
      "Trump administration officials have singled out a group of nations they dubbed the \"Dirty 15,\"\u00a0 a reference to the 15% of countries expected to be hit hardest by the new reciprocal tariffs given their trade surplus with the U.S.",
      "Those nations account for \"a huge amount of our trading volume,\" U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told Fox News' Maria Bartiromo on March 18, without naming the trade partners.",
      "National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett also told Fox News that the White House is targeting 10 to 15 nations with the biggest trade surplus with the U.S. Like Bessent, he also refrained from naming those nations.",
      "In 2024, the largest U.S. trade deficits around the globe \u2014 meaning countries from which the U.S. imports more than it exports \u2014 was with the following nations, according to federal data:",

      "Austria ($13.1 billion)",
      "Sweden ($9.8 billion)",
      "Are reciprocal prices likely to drive up consumer prices?",
      "Experts say reciprocal tariffs would mean added costs for U.S. businesses, which in turn would likely raise consumer prices in order to protect their profit margins.",
      "\"Tariffs are a tax on a business bringing a product into the country. When they receive it at a port of entry, whether it be an airport or seaport, they have to pay the duty to have it admitted into the country,\" Chris Barrett, a professor at Cornell SC Johnson School of Business, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"You've just added a cost on for the business, and those costs get passed on, at least to some degree, to consumers.\"",
      "How much prices could rise remains unclear. Meanwhile, prices could fall if Mr. Trump later lowers or removes reciprocal tariffs following trade negotiations.",
      "But when there is no good substitute for a particular good, consumer costs are likely to rise more sharply.",
      "\"The more price insensitive they are, the more likely they are to shoulder the burden of the tax,\" Barrett said.",

    "story": [
      "The Trump administration admitted in a court filing Monday that an \"administrative error\" and an \"oversight\" resulted in a Salvadoran man's deportation and imprisonment in a supermax prison in El Salvador, despite a legal order prohibiting his removal there.",
      "Acting Immigration and Customs Enforcement field office director Robert Cerna said that Kilmar Abrego Garcia was removed from the U.S. on March 15 as part of a series of deportation flights that sent hundreds of alleged gang members to a notorious prison in El Salvador, even though an immigration judge had granted him a legal protection from deportation.",
      "Those flights are at the center of a court battle between the Justice Department and U.S. District Court Judge James Boasberg, who blocked further deportations of alleged Tren de Aragua gang members under the Trump administration's invocation of the Alien Enemies Act of 1798.",
      "The March 15 deportation flights transported 238 Venezuelas and 23 Salvadorans, all of whom Trump administration officials described as members of the Tren de Aragua and MS-13 gangs. Lawyers and relatives of many of the Venezuelans have strongly denied claims that their clients and loved ones are gang members.",
      "The filings were made as part of a suit filed by attorneys for Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran man and Maryland resident who received a legal status known as \"withholding of removal\" in 2019 after an immigration judge found that Abrego Garcia, who left his native country in 2011 at age 16, could face persecution by gangs if deported to El Salvador. His case was first reported by The Atlantic late Monday.",
      "Although the Trump administration concedes it made a mistake when it deported Abrego Garcia, it is opposing a request for him to be brought back to the U.S. The government has argued Abrego Garcia is a danger to the community, alleging that he's a member of the MS-13 gang.",
      "The Justice Department has also argued that federal courts lack the authority to facilitate Abrego Garcia's return, since he's now being held by the Salvadoran government and no longer in U.S. custody. Even if they did have the power to order his return, the Justice Department said in a filing, there has been \"no showing that El Salvador is even inclined to consider a request to release a detainee at the United States' request.\"",
      "Attorney Simon Sandoval-Mosheberg called the Trump administration's refusal to try to get his client back \"appalling.\"",
      "\"I've had wrongful deportation cases before, including in the last Trump administration and in every single such case, as soon as they realize what they've done, they bent over backwards,\" he told CBS News.",
      "Abrego Garcia was living in Maryland, alongside his wife and their disabled 5-year-old son, both of whom are U.S. citizens, according to the court filings submitted by his lawyers. Before he was arrested by ICE last month, Abrego Garcia was routinely attending check-ins with the agency, the filings said. His lawyers said he has no criminal record in the U.S., a finding the government has not disputed.",
      "In 2019, Abrego Garcia was standing outside of a Home Depot in Hyattsville, Maryland, soliciting work with three other men when he was arrested. His attorney said he was questioned about whether he was a gang member, and when he told police he was not, the police said they didn't believe him and said they were calling ICE.",
      "During immigration proceedings, Abrego Garcia's attorneys said the only evidence the government provided in support of his gang affiliation was that he was wearing a Chicago Bulls hat and hoodie and that a confidential informant said he was an active MS-13 member in a branch of the gang that operates on Long Island, New York, where Abrego Garcia's attorneys say he has never lived.",
      "\"He's not a gang member. The allegations against him are based on whispers and shadows,\" Sandoval-Mosheberg said.",
      "Abrego Garcia's attorneys wrote in their initial complaint\u00a0that their client's name was not included in a Hyattsville City Police Department report about the Home Depot arrest, and said that the detective who authored the gang affiliation part of the report had been suspended.",
      "An immigration judge ruled that the informant's testimony was \"proven and reliable,\" but said that he should not be deported to El Salvador.",
      "In a statement Tuesday, a Department of Homeland Security spokesperson said Abrego Garcia is \"a member of the brutal MS-13 gang and was reportedly involved in human trafficking. Whether he be in El Salvador or a detention facility in the U.S. he should be locked up.\"",
      "Vice President JD Vance responded to media reports about the deportation on Tuesday, posting on X that \"It is telling that the entire American media is going to run a propaganda operation today making you think an innocent 'father of 3' was apprehended by a gulag,\" adding that Abrego Garcia \"is an illegal immigrant with no right to be in our country.\"",

      "Senior leaders at multiple agencies were removed, multiple health officials said, including Dr. Jeanne Marrazzo. Marrazzo replaced Dr. Anthony Fauci as the head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.",
      "At the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, senior officials put on leave and reassigned to the Indian Health Service include Dr. Karen Hacker, head of the agency's chronic disease teams, Kayla Laserson, head of its global health center and Dr. Jonathan Mermin, director of the CDC's STD and HIV/AIDS center.",

      "\"As we navigate these challenges, I will do my best to lead NIH through these reforms, implement new policies humanely, and endeavor to earn your trust,\" he said.",
      "A top-ranking official at another HHS agency was also reassigned, one official familiar with the move said. All the other options they were given would have involved relocating, the official said they were told.",
      "Another official said that senior leaders in their team had been offered reassignment to remote locations several states away, one official said. At the Food and Drug Administration, one official had been told that refusing the reassignment would result in them losing their severance pay.",
      "\"How insulting to IHS and the center directors. The IHS sites fill critical gaps, they aren't an American Gulag Archipelago,\" one CDC official said.",
      "Other top officials effectively ousted Tuesday include Dr. John Howard, head of the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health, and Dr. Brian King, the top regulator of tobacco products at the Food and Drug Administration, current and former officials said.",
      "In a statement, an official for the department said that the Indian Health Service was not impacted by this week's cuts and that that the agency \"has long faced challenges related to staffing shortages.\"",
      "\"To address staffing needs and support the IHS in fulfilling its mission, HHS has invited certain individuals to consider positions within the IHS. These invitations are voluntary, and individuals have the option to accept or decline,\" the official said.",

      "New leaders at the FDA and NIH also started on the job Tuesday, HHS announced. They were confirmed by the Senate earlier this month.",

      "In Hacker's center at the CDC, multiple teams were gutted by the layoffs, according to a list circulated among agency officials, including the Division of Reproductive Health, Division of Population Health and Office of Smoking and Health. Under Mermin's STD and HIV/AIDS center, tuberculosis elimination and studies branches were cut.",
      "It comes after several top officials have already resigned or been forced out at federal health agencies, including the FDA's top vaccines official Dr. Peter Marks last week and the agency's top food safety and nutrition official earlier this year.",
      "More resignations or cuts are expected in the coming weeks, officials said, as leaders at the agencies wrestle with the chaos caused by the cuts.",

    "summary": "President Trump has signed a string of executive orders in recent weeks targeting some of the nation's most prominent law firms.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump's string of executive orders in recent weeks that target major law firms mark the latest front in his effort to settle long-held scores with political opponents. But the broadside has been met with alarm about the damage the punishments could do to the viability of the firms and, crucially, the threat they pose to the rule of law.",
      "The executive orders signed by Mr. Trump have so far targeted four law firms: Perkins Coie, Paul Weiss, Wilmer Cutler Pickering Hale and Dorr LLP, and Jenner & Block. But the directive targeting Paul Weiss was rescinded after it and Mr. Trump reached an agreement under which the firm agreed to provide $40 million in pro bono legal services for causes that the administration supports, among other assurances.",
      "A fifth firm, Covington & Burling, was the subject of a directive that targeted the security clearance of a lawyer who assisted former special counsel Jack Smith, who oversaw the two prosecutions of Mr. Trump that were dropped, one in July 2024, and the other after he was elected to a second term. And a sixth, Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP, entered into a preemptive deal with the president to provide more than $100 million in free legal work, along with other commitments. The president announced Tuesday an agreement with Willkie Farr & Gallagher LLP, where former second gentleman Doug Emhoff is a partner, in which the firm would offer at least $100 million in pro bono services. The firm also represented former\u00a0Georgia election workers Ruby Freeman and Shaye Moss in their lawsuit against Trump ally Rudy Giuliani.",
      "The executive orders are among the more than 100 that Mr. Trump has issued since returning to the White House for a second term, and they come amid a broader campaign of retribution against his critics that includes revoking security clearances and protective details.",
      "But legal scholars warn that the restrictions aimed at the law firms strike at the rule of law and the nation's adversarial system of justice.",
      "\"These orders do more than just take revenge against particular lawyers who have crossed Donald Trump,\" said Walter Olson, a senior fellow at the Cato Institute. \"They are meant to send the message that it is dangerous to oppose him in court, that you are apt to suffer not just yourself, but also law firms that you're associated with will suffer sweeping penalties that can threaten their very ability to go on existing.\"",
      "The orders rolled out by Mr. Trump in the past few weeks target the firms for their legal work, as well as the lawyers who were on their payrolls \u2014 even if they're not anymore.",
      "In the case of Perkins Coie, the president's directive attacks the firm for representing Hillary Clinton during her 2016 presidential campaign and hiring a research firm that retained former British spy Christopher Steele, who produced the infamous \"Steele Dossier.\"",
      "For WilmerHale and Jenner & Block, the orders seek to punish the firms because they hired lawyers who worked on the Justice Department's investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election during Mr. Trump's first term. At WilmerHale, that includes Robert Mueller, the former special counsel who led that probe, and two lawyers who worked on his team, Aaron Zebley and James Quarles. Mueller and Quarles no longer work at WilmerHale. At Jenner & Block, the president attacked the firm for employing Andrew Weissmann, who also worked on Mueller's probe. He left Jenner & Block in 2021.",
      "Jenner & Block, WilmerHale and Perkins Coie are also involved in legal challenges to Mr. Trump's second-term policies, including his effort to withhold federal funds from medical institutions that provide gender-affirming care to young people under the age of 19, his firing of eight inspectors general and directive to prohibit transgender people from serving in the military.",
      "\"These firms are at the vanguard of fighting the Trump administration on a whole host of issues,\" said David Lat, a lawyer-turned-writer who authors a newsletter on legal affairs. \"So, if Donald Trump can force or frighten law firms into not taking cases against his administration, that will allow the administration to become more powerful.\"",
      "Lat likened the executive orders to a boxing match where one fighter is trying to chop the arms off of their opponent.",
      "\"In America, our legal system rests on the idea that you are entitled to a lawyer, and these executive orders are deterring law firms and lawyers from taking certain cases,\" he said. \"The other issue is they are a threat to the rule of law, and they are a threat to the adversarial system that powers our justice system.\"",
      "Mr. Trump justified the orders as furthering his administration's commitment to addressing the \"significant risks\" associated with \"Big Law firms,\" which he claims \"engage in conduct detrimental to critical American interests.\"",
      "The president's orders specifically require any government contractors to disclose any business they have with the firms and also direct agency heads to cancel any contracts with the targets of the orders. Agencies also must reassess contracts with the firms or companies that do business with them to ensure funding decisions align \"with the interests of the citizens of the United States\" and administration priorities.",
      "Finally, Mr. Trump's executive actions calls on his administration to restrict access to federal buildings for employees of Perkins Coie, WilmerHale and Jenner & Block.",
      "The three firms have all filed federal lawsuits challenging the orders as violations of the First, Fifth and Sixth Amendments.",
      "\"This lawsuit is absolutely critical to vindicating the First Amendment, our adversarial system of justice, and the rule of law,\" Paul Clement, who served as solicitor general under President George W. Bush and has argued more than 100 cases before the Supreme Court, said in a statement. Clement is representing WilmerHale in its challenge to Mr. Trump's executive order.",
      "Three different judges assigned to each of the cases \u2014 appointed by two different presidents \u2014 have agreed to temporarily block portions of the orders while proceedings move forward. While the cases may end with a decision from the Supreme Court months from now that invalidates the directives as unconstitutional, the fallout has been swift.",
      "Thomas Perrelli, firm chair and a partner at Jenner & Block, said in a declaration last week that one client was notified by the Justice Department that they could not bring their lawyers from the firm to a department meeting set for April 3. That client, Perrelli wrote, would've had to attend the meeting without their outside representation or hire new counsel. A federal district court blocked enforcement of the portion of Mr. Trump's order restricting Jenner & Block employees' access to federal buildings and the requirements for government contractors.",
      "He also wrote that 40% of the firm's revenue last year came from clients who are government contractors or subcontractors, and warned that if the firm lost that business, \"it would be a serious threat to the firm's financial health.\"",
      "Bruce Berman, general counsel at WilmerHale, wrote in his own declaration that at least 21 of the firm's 25 largest clients in 2024 \u2014 which accounted for 30% of its revenue, or nearly $500 million \u2014 have federal contracts. He noted that WilmerHale attorneys are set to meet with Justice Department lawyers over videoconference this week, but said at the time of his filing that it was uncertain whether they would refuse to meet with them.",
      "At Perkins Coie, David Burman, a partner at the firm, told a federal court in a filing that several clients terminated or said they were considering ending their legal engagements because of the restrictions imposed by Mr. Trump's order. Burman said that a major government contractor that had been a client for more than 35 years withdrew its work from Perkins Coie in light of the order, and four other clients rescinded its work from the firm early last month because they needed to engage with federal agencies.",
      "\"The orders don't have to go into effect for them to strike fear in the hearts of lawyers across the country,\" Lat said, adding that while law firms are wealthy, they can also be fragile.",
      "For many so-called \"Big Law\" firms, their work involves serving not only individuals, but also large corporations that seek help with patent or trademark applications, mergers and acquisitions or energy transactions \u2014 areas that land before a federal regulatory agency.",
      "But a swift departure of those clients means firms are at risk of losing sizable chunks of business at once, which could also force their lawyers to leave if their practice area involves significant government involvement.",
      "\"These firms can face a run of clients against them the same way the banks can face a run of depositors trying to take out their money at once,\" Olson said. \"This can quickly turn into a downward spiral.\"",
      "The potential damage to their business \u2014 and the ripple effect that would have on employees \u2014 may be why some law firms have remained on the sidelines and chosen not to speak out against Mr. Trump's sanctions. Olson acknowledged there are many reasons why other firms may want to stay out of the president's sight line for fear of retaliation.",
      "But he said that an \"age-old part of being a free republic\" is protecting the independence of the court and the legal profession so they don't become instruments of the person in power.",
      "\"Sometimes the times call for courage,\" Olson said. \"Are you recognizing that this is one of those times that the ordinary calculations aren't good enough, the calculations that would do against many ordinary sorts of danger? This is an extraordinary danger. Maybe it calls for extraordinary courage.\"",

      "Jury selection began Monday in the Arizona trial of \"Doomsday mom\" Lori Vallow Daybell, the Utah mother who was sentenced to life in prison in Idaho for killing her children in 2019.",
      "In Arizona, Vallow Daybell has been indicted on a charge of conspiracy to commit murder in the death of her fourth husband, Charles Vallow.",
      "She has pled not guilty to the charge, and is representing herself at the trial.",
      "What did Lori Vallow Daybell do?",
      "Lori Vallow Daybell was sentenced to life in prison without parole in the killings of her children, Tylee Ryan and Joshua Jaxon \"JJ\" Vallow. Tylee was Vallow Daybell's child from a previous relationship. She and Charles Vallow adopted JJ in 2012.",
      "In 2018, Vallow Daybell met doomsday-fiction author Chad Daybell. A year later, she separated from Vallow and began a relationship with Daybell.",
      "The couple held apocalyptic religious beliefs that prosecutors claimed were used to justify the killings of Tylee, JJ and Daybell's first wife, Tammy Daybell.",
      "Tylee and JJ disappeared within two weeks of each other in September 2019. In October 2019, Tammy Daybell was found dead in her bed. A coroner said her death initially appeared to be due to natural causes, but an autopsy wasn't conducted before her body was buried. Two weeks later, in November 2019, Daybell and Vallow Daybell were married in Hawaii.",
      "The remains of Tammy Daybell were exhumed in December 2019, an autopsy was performed and her cause of death was determined to be asphyxiation. In February 2020, Vallow Daybell was arrested in Hawaii for ignoring a police order to produce her children, who had been reported missing by their grandparents. Several months later, in June 2020, the bodies of Tylee and JJ were found on a property owned by Chad Daybell.",
      "Daybell and Vallow Daybell were each charged in the deaths of Tammy Daybell, Tylee and JJ. In separate trials, they were each found guilty of murder and conspiracy to commit murder in the children's deaths. Vallow Daybell was also convicted of conspiracy to commit murder in Tammy Daybell's death and of theft charges related to financial payments sent to her children.",
      "Daybell was found guilty of murder in Tammy Daybell's death, as well as several other related charges. He has been sentenced to death.",
      "What was Lori Vallow Daybell's relationship with Charles Vallow?",
      "Lori Vallow Daybell and Charles Vallow were married from 2006 to 2019.",
      "In early 2019, Vallow became very worried about his wife. He went to the police with his concerns, telling them that Vallow Daybell believed she was a \"god\" who was preparing for the end of days.",
      "\"She threatened me, murder me, kill me,\" he told police in a conversation recorded on video, according to \"48 Hours.\"",
      "Vallow filed for divorce in February 2019. In the filing, he said that Vallow Daybell had threatened to murder him. He also expressed fears for JJ and Tylee's safety.",
      "How did Charles Vallow die?",
      "Charles Vallow was shot and killed by Lori Vallow Daybell's brother, Alexander Lamar Cox, on July 11, 2019.",
      "Vallow had gone to the home where Vallow Daybell was living with Cox and the two children after their separation to pick up JJ. The home was in Chandler, a suburb of Phoenix, Arizona.",
      "In police video, Tylee said that she heard Vallow and Cox arguing.",
      "\"Honestly, it feels, it feels like 2 seconds, and 40 minutes at the same time. ... I just kind of heard yelling over everything. I don't know, I kind of just do that when everything is, like, really loud, I kind of just tune what people are saying out,\" she told detectives.",
      "Cox told police that he had killed Vallow in self-defense. He was not arrested.",
      "Cox's wife, Zulema Pastenes, testified that Daybell and Vallow Daybell had convinced him that his divine mission was to protect his sister. Pastenes said that Cox told her he feared the pair would make him their \"fall guy.\" That conversation, Pastenes said, occurred a day before Cox's sudden death in December 2019. Medical examiners said he died of a pulmonary blood clot.",

      "In December 2024, a judge ruled that Vallow Daybell was mentally fit to stand trial. Cameras will be allowed in the courtroom during the trial, CBS affiliate AZFamily reported. The trial will be livestreamed.",
      "Complicating the trial is Vallow Daybell's decision to represent herself. She said that this will likely complicate jury selection, a comment Judge Justin Beresky agreed with, according to AZFamily. Vallow Daybell said that she has studied case law during her time in prison. She also said she has experience in court that will help her represent herself.",
      "In a hearing on March 18, Vallow appeared to struggle with the responsibility of being her own attorney. She said that her former attorneys would not give her important video evidence, though prosecutors said they can't find the video she referenced, according to AZFamily. Vallow Daybell also said that it has been difficult for her to communicate with her legal team while in prison.",
      "\"Where I am at the jail, the communication is very difficult for me to get ahold of my investigator, get ahold of my paralegal. I'm 23 hours a day locked down. If I don't have Wi-Fi, I don't have a phone, if I don't have battery, I don't have a phone,\" she said.",
      "Opening statements are expected to begin in early April, according to AZFamily. If found guilty, Vallow faces life in prison with the possibility of parole after 25 years. She is already serving multiple life sentences with no possibility of parole after the convictions in Idaho.",
      "This trial is not the last of her legal troubles. Vallow Daybell also faces a charge of conspiracy to commit murder for the attempted shooting of her niece's ex-husband, Brandon Boudreaux.

      "\"Let me just make this clear, that rule being brought down means that we can't have any further action on the floor this week,\" Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, told reporters after the vote. \"It's very unfortunate. We'll regroup and come back.\"",
      "The fight over whether to allow remote voting for new moms and dads who serve in Congress came to a head this week with Rep. Anna Paulina Luna, a Florida Republican, leaving the conservative House Freedom Caucus as her colleagues plotted against the bipartisan measure.",
      "The measure, which was introduced by Democratic Rep. Brittany Pettersen of Colorado in January, would allow new parents to designate a colleague to vote for them for 12 weeks after they or their spouse gives birth. The bill would also allow that period to begin earlier if the lawmaker has a serious medical condition or isn't able to travel safely.",

      "Luna, a cosponsor of the bill, moved to bypass leadership and launched a discharge petition that forces a vote on a measure if it secures at least a simple majority. Luna's discharge petition quickly reached the threshold, with 206 Democrats and 11 other Republicans signing on.",
      "Republicans then sought to derail Luna's effort by inserting language into a rule governing debate on an unrelated bill on election security that would table her discharge petition.",

      "\"The speaker is being held hostage,\" Luna told reporters Monday.",
      "Luna has argued that allowing new parents to vote remotely is not unconstitutional because members voting by proxy would not count toward a quorum. Those against the practice have themselves voted by proxy during the pandemic, including Johnson, Luna noted.",
      "Democrats instituted proxy voting during the pandemic, but it was ended by Republicans when they regained the House majority in 2023.",

      "The Trump administration is planning to impose a round of fresh tariffs on April 2, a day President Trump has dubbed \"Liberation Day.\" The announcement is viewed by economists as the culmination of his \"America First Trade Policy,\" an\u00a0executive order he signed on his first day in office aimed at revitalizing U.S. manufacturing.",
      "Mr. Trump has referred to his April 2 tariff announcement as \"the big one,\" suggesting that the plans may be more far reaching than the import levies he's already unleashed on goods from other nations, such as his March 26 declaration of 25% tariffs on vehicles and auto parts imported into the\u00a0U.S.",
      "\"For DECADES we have been ripped off and abused by every nation in the World, both friend and foe. Now it is finally time for the Good Ol' USA to get some of that MONEY, and RESPECT, BACK. GOD BLESS AMERICA!!!\" Trump said about his April 2 plans in a post\u00a0earlier this month on Truth Social.",
      "On April 2, Mr. Trump will announce his administration's plans for so-called reciprocal tariffs, at an event in the White House Rose Garden, the White House said. He deems the levies necessary to erase trade imbalances with nations that export more goods to the U.S. than they import from America. But the addition of broad-based tariffs to a host of imports is likely to heat up a global trade war that could, at least in the short term, boost prices for U.S. consumers and juice inflation.",
      "\"Tariffs are a tax on imported goods, and research shows that that majority gets passed along to consumers,\" Colin Grabow, associate director of the Herbert A. Stiefel Center for trade policy studies at the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Ultimately, the Trump administration's goal is to increase prices on imports to the point where it's economically favorable for companies to relocate their manufacturing to the U.S., he noted.",
      "\"If prices don't go up, it doesn't deter imports, and therefore there is no reason to set up shop in the U.S.,\" Grabow explained. \"Part of the logic is premised on prices going up, otherwise they are not going to accomplish their goal.\"",
      "Economists say that Mr. Trump's tariff agenda, including the uncertainty surrounding it, could drag down U.S. GDP by depressing financial markets and consumer sentiment.",
      "\"The main channel from trade policy uncertainty to GDP is via business investment. Under higher trade policy uncertainty, future revenue streams of an investment become more uncertain, raising the option value of delaying investment decisions until the situation is clearer,\" Oxford Economics analysts said in a research note.",
      "What tariffs will Trump announce April 2?",
      "Mr. Trump teased his April 2 announcement last week when he announced his new 25% tariffs on foreign-made cars and auto parts. \"That's Liberation Day, that's gonna be on the 2nd, and that's gonna be reciprocal, and I think people will be impressed,\" the president said.",
      "Reciprocal tariffs are designed to match the import duties placed on U.S. goods and services by other nations, as well as compensate for other trade barriers, according to the Yale Budget Lab, a non-partisan public policy think tank. According to a White House memo from Feb. 13, the U.S. faces additional trade barriers aside from tariffs such as regulatory requirements that can make it more difficult for American exports to reach other nations.",
      "While the size and scope of the reciprocal tariffs that Mr. Trump plans to announce are still unknown, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent previously said the administration's reciprocal tariffs would target countries with the biggest trade surpluses, as well as those which have imposed the highest tariffs plus non-tariff trade barriers on U.S. goods.",
      "Multiple nations run large annual trade surpluses with the U.S., including Germany, Ireland and Italy in the European Union, as well as Vietnam, Japan and Taiwan. The U.S. also has a large trade deficit with China, although Mr. Trump has already imposed new tariffs on that nation.",
      "\"It'll be in many cases less than the tariff that they've been charging us for decades ... I think we're trying to keep it somewhat conservative,\" Mr. Trump said on March 26.",
      "Mr. Trump added that he'll introduce a reciprocal tariff policy on \"all countries,\" which he said would be \"very lenient.\"",
      "On Sunday, National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett told Fox News' Maria Bartiromo that there are 15 countries \"that we have massive, massive trade deficits with,\" but that Mr. Trump will ultimately decided how many countries will be subject to new tariffs Wednesday.",
      "Mr. Hassett also promoted tariffs as an effective tool for reshoring manufacturing to the U.S., saying \"it's going to be a boom,\" referring to auto manufacturing in particular.",
      "Meanwhile, additional tariffs are also slated to go into effect on April 2, with Mr. Trump's one-month delay on 25% tariffs on Canadian and Mexican imports set to expire that day. The 25% auto tariff announced by the president on March 26 is also scheduled to take effect on April 2.",
      "What are reciprocal tariffs?",
      "Reciprocal tariffs enacted by the U.S. would match foreign nations' levies and other trade policies on American goods.",
      "A reciprocal tariff policy would include calculating a country-specific number that the Trump administration deems representative of all trade barriers. But import restrictions other than tariffs, such as regulatory requirements, could be hard to quantify, economists say.",
      "\"There are a lot of intangibles, like testing regulations for different products in countries, or perceived openness to business with American companies,\" Simon Macadam, deputy chief global economist at Capital Economics, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"These are things you can't easily put a number on.\"",
      "Because of this complexity, some experts expect Trump's reciprocal tariffs could be more limited in scope, and might not be truly \"reciprocal\" because they may not exactly match other countries' levies.",
      "\"We shouldn't be surprised if some of the stuff is rolled back, or not as sweeping as maybe originally talked about, because logistically, from a practical perspective, running the calculations and coming up with a number is extremely time consuming,\" Grabow of the Cato Institute said.",
      "Wilbur Ross, who served as the U.S. Secretary of Commerce during the first Trump administration, agreed that a truly reciprocal tariff policy would be \"very complicated to get to work.\"",
      "\"If you were literally going to be reciprocal, you would put the same tariff on a product that comes into the U.S. as that country charges on products from the U.S.,\" he said. \"But the problem is you'd be charging a different tariff on the same item from different countries.\"",
      "That would create loopholes for exporters to ship products through lower-tariffed countries to the U.S., Ross added. \"It would make it easy for people to game the system,\" he said.",
      "What does Trump want to achieve?",
      "Through his \"Fair and Reciprocal Plan\" on trade, Mr. Trump is aiming to bring about three outcomes: Boost U.S. manufacturing jobs; close the $1.2 trillion U.S. trade deficit; and gain leverage over U.S. trade partners.",
      "But experts say that trade barriers such as tariffs may not be enough to revitalize U.S. manufacturing jobs, which have fallen sharply over the last few decades. Fewer than 13 million people are employed in manufacturing today, down from a peak of 19.6 million in 1979,\u00a0according to federal data.",
      "\"To a large extent, and particularly in low- and medium-tech industries, the economics of production will not be significantly altered by a 10-20% tariff,\" Macadam said. \"When labor costs in hubs like Mexico are one-fifth of what they are in the U.S., in order to induce companies to seriously relocate a lot of production back to the U.S. a 20% tariff isn't going to cut it.\"",
      "There's also the unknown of how long any new tariffs announced by Mr. Trump will remain in place. Such uncertainty could deter American or foreign businesses from investing heavily in re-shoring manufacturing to the U.S.",
      "\"Even if for some companies it gets to the point where it seems to make financial sense to move back to the U.S., there's the question of, 'Are these tariffs actually going to last a long time?'\" Macadam said. \"If you think the tariff is going to be there forever, then yeah, absolutely relocate. But if it's reversed or rates are lowered, then it would have been silly to relocate.\"",
      "What will tariffs mean for consumers?",
      "Consumers typically pay the price for tariffs, as companies have said they plan on passing off much of the costs to their customers.",
      "As a result, a round of fresh tariffs could boost inflation, economists say. According to an analysis by Oxford Economics, if the effective tariff rate on imports into the U.S. rises from their 2024 level of 2.5% to 10% in April, which is what Oxford Economics expects, prices in aggregate would rise by half a percentage point.",
      "\"Inflation was on trend to fall \u2014 now we expect it to rise,\" Michael Pearce, senior U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, told CBS MoneyWatch.",

    "story": [
      "Attorney General Pam Bondi directed federal prosecutors to seek the death penalty against Luigi Mangione, who is accused of murder\u00a0in the\u00a0deadly shooting of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson. Mangione is in federal custody in New York City, where the shooting happened in early December.",
      "\"Luigi Mangione's murder of Brian Thompson \u2014 an innocent man and father of two young children \u2014 was a premeditated, cold-blooded assassination that shocked America,\" Bondi said in a statement on April 1. \"After careful consideration, I have directed federal prosecutors to seek the death penalty in this case as we carry out President Trump's agenda to stop violent crime and Make America Safe Again.\"",
      "The 26-year-old faces federal murder and stalking charges, as well as state murder and terrorism charges in New York. The state charges are not eligible for the death penalty.",
      "Here's what we know about Mangione.",
      "He is awaiting trial after December arrest",
      "Mangione is awaiting trial several months after he was arrested amid a massive\u00a0manhunt\u00a0for the shooter. He was taken into custody on Dec. 9 after being spotted at a\u00a0McDonald's in Altoona, Pennsylvania.",
      "Mangione arrived in New York in mid-December after he waived extradition in a Pennsylvania courtroom.",
      "Federal prosecutors filed four charges against him\u00a0\u2014 murder, using a weapon with a silencer, and two counts of stalking. Additionally, 11 state charges were filed by the Manhattan district attorney in December, including murder in the first degree and murder as a crime of terrorism. First-degree murder charges in New York are usually reserved for the killing of law enforcement officers.",
      "Mangione has pleaded not guilty to the state charges, but has not yet been arraigned on the federal charges. The federal charges could make him eligible for the death penalty, if he is convicted.",
      "His next hearing in federal court is scheduled for April 18. A state court hearing is scheduled for June.",
      "At his\u00a0last court appearance in February, which was a preliminary pretrial hearing, Mangione sat attentive, wearing a bulletproof vest and shackles. New York prosecutors described some of the evidence they submitted, including surveillance video and forensic tests, while Mangione's defense attorney expressed concern that she was still missing the bulk of the evidence, which she told the judge may infringe on his right to a fair trial, CBS News New York reported.",
      "Mangione's lawyers have proposed that he receive a specially configured laptop in jail that would only allow him to review case materials, and the Federal Bureau of Prisons said it would review the request if it is formally submitted. The bureau added that discovery laptops are allowed only in the visiting room, not in housing units, CBS News New York reported.",
      "The Manhattan District Attorney's office objected to the request, arguing that he can access desktop computers in the detention center.",
      "Attorney Karen Friedman Agnifilo, who was a high-ranking deputy in the Manhattan district attorney's office for years before entering private practice, has been retained to represent Mangione, her law firm, Agnifilo Intrater LLP, confirmed in a statement to CBS News.",
      "Police say suspect's mother said shooting \"might be something that she could see him doing\"",
      "Speaking to reporters on Dec. 17, NYPD Chief of Detectives Joseph Kenny said that before Mangione's arrest, his mother told an FBI task force that the shooting \"might be something that she could see him doing.\"",
      "The task force contacted Mangione's mother on Dec. 7 after a San Francisco police sergeant looking for Mangione alerted the FBI in San Francisco that the person of interest in the shooting could be him, Kenny told reporters. Mangione's mother had filed a missing person report with San Francisco police on Nov. 18.",
      "The FBI's San Francisco field office passed the information on to the task force in New York.",
      "He was not a UnitedHealthcare customer",
      "The New York Police Department told CBS News that there are no indications that Mangione was a UnitedHealthcare customer.",
      "Officials believe Mangione may have targeted the company because of its status as the largest health insurer in the United States.",
      "He may have traveled to Pennsylvania by train",
      "Following the shooting, investigators have said that the suspect fled into Central Park on a bike and then took a cab to the George Washington Bridge Bus Station in upper Manhattan.",
      "While investigators initially thought the suspect may have left New York City on a bus that departed from the bus station, NYPD Assistant Commissioner Carlos Nieves told CBS New York on Dec. 12 they now believe the suspect took the A subway line back down to Penn Station in Midtown, where they are looking into whether he traveled by train to Pennsylvania.",
      "The NYPD was working with Pennsylvania State Police and Altoona police to track Mangione's movements while he was in Pennsylvania.",
      "His notebook says he considered using a bomb, sources say",
      "Two law enforcement sources told CBS News that authorities recovered a notebook from Mangione at the time of his arrest. The sources said in the notebook he wrote that he considered using a bomb but decided on a shooting because it would be more targeted and would not put innocent lives in danger.",
      "While in custody in Pennsylvania, Mangione has not made incriminating statements to NYPD investigators, according to police.",
      "His fingerprints match prints found near shooting scene, police say",
      "Fingerprints found on a water bottle and protein bar near where Thompson was killed match the fingerprints taken from Mangione when he was booked into jail, NYPD Commissioner Jessica Tisch said on Dec. 11. Police also told CBS News that fingerprints on a phone found at the scene are a match to Mangione's.",
      "Investigators also matched a \"ghost gun\" that police found with Mangione in Pennsylvania to three 9 mm\u00a0shell casings from the shooting in New York, according to the NYPD.",
      "The fingerprint match was first reported by CNN. It was the first publicly announced forensic evidence linking Mangione to the crime scene.",
      "The NYPD received over 400 tips to its Crime Stoppers hotline about the case. All of the tips were vetted, and police said 30 were helpful. The New York City Police Foundation was offering a reward of up to $10,000 for information, and will vet the tips to determine who gets the reward. Separately, the FBI offered a reward of up to $50,000 for information leading to an arrest and conviction.",
      "What do police believe was the motive for the shooting?",
      "Investigators' working theory for the motive behind the shooting is animosity toward the health care industry. The NYPD said it appears Mangione suffered a debilitating back injury on July 4, 2023, that required a visit to an emergency room and subsequently screws on his spine, according to images posted on social media.",
      "According to the NYPD, Mangione was in possession of notebook paper that had handwritten notes that expressed disdain for corporate America, in particular the health care industry.",
      "Mangione was spotted and arrested in a McDonald's",
      "Mangione, who police said went to Pittsburgh and then Altoona after leaving New York, was arrested at a McDonald's after a customer alerted an employee who called police. Officers questioned Mangione, who they described as acting suspiciously.",
      "According to court documents, the Altoona officers found Mangione sitting at a table in the back of the McDonald's wearing a blue medical mask and looking at a laptop with a backpack on the floor near the table. When the officers asked him to pull the mask down, they recognized him from photos released to the media.",
      "Mangione was carrying multiple fraudulent IDs and a U.S. passport, Tisch said at a news conference. One of the IDs matched the fake New Jersey ID that the shooting suspect used to check into a Manhattan hostel before the shooting, the commissioner said.",
      "When the Altoona officers asked Mangione for his ID at the McDonald's, he gave them the New Jersey ID, according to an affidavit submitted with the criminal complaint. When one officer was checking the ID with dispatchers, the other asked Mangione if he had been to New York recently, and Mangione \"became quiet and started to shake,\" according to the affidavit.",
      "Mangione provided his real name after he was told he would be arrested if he lied about his identity, according to the affidavit. When an officer asked Mangione why he lied about his name, he allegedly said, \"I clearly shouldn't have.\"",
      "Officers found a gun and a suppressor that were consistent with the weapon used in the shooting of Thompson, Tisch said. Police said the gun found in his backpack\u00a0appeared to be a 3D-printed ghost gun, with a loaded Glock magazine with six 9 mm full metal jacket rounds and a 3D-printed silencer. Clothing and a mask consistent with those of the suspect in the case were also recovered, police said.",
      "Mangione was charged\u00a0Dec. 9 with five counts in Pennsylvania: forgery, firearms not to be carried without a license, tampering with records or identification, possessing instruments of crime, and false identification to law enforcement. New York filed a murder charge later that night.",
      "Pennsylvania State Police Lt. Col. George Bivens said Mangione was initially cooperative and then stopped cooperating with investigators.",
      "Held without bail at hearing",
      "At an extradition proceeding on Dec. 10 in Pennsylvania, Mangione was denied bail.",
      "As Mangione entered the Blair County Courthouse ahead of the Dec. 10 proceedings, he was aggressive and had to be contained, shouting that what was happening to him was \"an insult to the intelligence of the American people.\" While inside the courtroom, he quietly mumbled and mouthed words while sitting at the defense table.",
      "At his office, Dickey told reporters Dec. 10 he hadn't seen video footage of Mangione's outburst but said, \"Hopefully, there won't be any more of that.\"",
      "Dickey said he was hired to represent Mangione and not appointed to the case. He wouldn't identify who hired him, and he wouldn't comment on what Mangione has said to him.",
      "Dickey said Mangione would plead not guilty to the Pennsylvania charges, and said he'd advise Mangione to enter the same plea to the New York charges. Asked to clarify what specific charges Mangione would plead not guilty to, Dickey said, \"Every charge.\"",
      "\"Remember \u2014 and this is not just a small thing \u2014 the fundamental concept of American justice is the presumption of innocence and until you're proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, and I've seen zero evidence at this point,\" Dickey said.",
      "Police say Mangione had handwritten note expressing views",
      "A three-page handwritten document that \"speaks to both his motivation and mindset\" was also recovered from Mangione when he was apprehended by police, according to Tisch. NYPD sources referred to the notes as a claim of responsibility where Mangione\u00a0attempted to justify\u00a0his actions.",
      "Mangione wrote that the U.S. had \"most expensive healthcare system in the world\" but lamented that the country \"ranks #42 in life expectancy,\" according to NYPD sources.",
      "Mangione also referred to corporations as \"mafiosa [that] have gotten too powerful,\" and said such companies abuse the United States \"for immense profit.\" He wrote that others had shone a light on corporations' \"corruption and greed\" in the past and claimed that he was \"the first to face it with such brutal honesty.\"",
      "NYPD intelligence officers believe Mangione might have been inspired by \"Unabomber\" Ted Kaczynski, with the handwritten note reflecting a similar mindset.",
      "Kenny told reporters that officials \"don't think that there's any specific threats to other people mentioned in that document,\" but NYPD sources said police are concerned about the risk of extremists viewing Mangione as an example to follow. Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro expressed this concern during a news conference Dec. 9, and strongly condemned both the murder and those who celebrated it online.",
      "\"The suspect is a coward, not a hero,\" Shapiro said.",
      "He worked at TrueCar, has Ivy League degree",
      "According to his LinkedIn account, Mangione worked as a data engineer at the car-buying website TrueCar. But a company spokesperson told CBS News that Mangione hasn't worked there since 2023.",
      "Mangione\u00a0graduated from the University of Pennsylvania in 2020, a Penn spokesperson confirmed to CBS News. He received a Master of Science   in engineering with a major in computer and information science, and a Bachelor of Science in engineering, majoring in computer science with a minor in mathematics, the spokesperson confirmed.",
      "While at Penn, he worked as a teaching assistant and founded a video game development club, according to his LinkedIn account.",
      "At Stanford University in California, Mangione was a head counselor for a pre-collegiate studies program during the summer of 2019, the university said in a statement to CBS News.",
      "Mangione appeared to suffer from severe back pain",
      "Mangione's last known address was in Honolulu, Hawaii, Kenny told reporters. The Surfbreak co-living community in Honolulu told CBS News that Mangione had been a resident at the location in 2022.",
      "Sarah Nehemiah, who knew Mangione during his time at Surfbreak, said he left the community in April 2022 due to a lifelong back injury exacerbated by physical activity on the island. According to posts on his Reddit account, Mangione's back pain had been persistent for several years and worsened after surfing in Hawaii in 2022. Nehemiah and other members of the Surfbreak community \"lost contact\" with Mangione \"after he left,\" she said.",
      "R.J. Martin, a close friend of Mangione's in Hawaii, told CBS News that Mangione was often social except for \"when he was in severe pain.\"",
      "\"There were times where he would kind of hide out and I'd only hear about it afterwards, but he's one of those people that was such a gentleman,\" Martin said. \"He never complained. He would only tell me about things after the fact.\"",
      "Martin said the pain \"inhibited him from doing a lot of activities he wanted to,\" but said Mangione was active when not in pain.",
      "Martin grew emotional during the interview. \"I just feel heartbroken, you know, somebody that I loved and cared about ... could have done something so hideous,\" he said.",
      "The background image on Mangione's X account shows an X-ray of a spine with hardware in it, reflective of previous surgery. It is not known if this is an X-ray of Mangione's spine. An orthopedist told CBS News that the image appeared to show a hardware fusion, likely for a condition called spondylolisthesis, which is when a vertebra slips out of alignment. Mangione referenced the condition on Reddit and other social media accounts.",
      "Mangione said on Reddit that he had spinal surgery in July 2023. In October, he indicated that the operation had gone well, saying that he was \"taking zero pain meds\" and hadn't \"had a bad day\" since the surgery, eight days before. In February 2024, Mangione said the surgery came \"after 1.5 years of failed conservative treatment.\"",
      "He's related to a prominent Maryland family",
      "Mangione was born and raised in Maryland, Kenny said. He is related to a prominent Maryland family that owns country clubs, health care facilities and real estate companies, CBS News Baltimore\u00a0reported. He's also a cousin of Maryland state Delegate Nino Mangione, who represents parts of Baltimore County.",
      "Mangione's paternal grandparents, Nicholas and Mary Mangione, were real estate developers who purchased the Turf Valley Country Club in 1978 and Hayfields Country Club in Hunt Valley in 1986. They founded Lorien Health Systems in 1977, and operated WCBM, a Baltimore radio station.",
      "Mangione's family said Dec. 9 in a statement, \"Unfortunately, we cannot comment on news reports regarding Luigi Mangione. We only know what we have read in the media. Our family is shocked and devastated by Luigi's arrest. We offer our prayers to the family of Brian Thompson and we ask people to pray for all involved. We are devastated by this news.\"",
      "Mangione\u00a0graduated\u00a0in 2016 from the Gilman School, an all-boys private school in Baltimore, according to his LinkedIn account. He was the school's valedictorian and captained its robotics team. He also received a scholarship prize in 2014. He also volunteered at Lorien Health Systems in 2014, according to his\u00a0LinkedIn.",
      "A former classmate, who wishes to remain anonymous out of respect for the Mangione family and said he met Mangione in middle school and remained close with him through high school, told CBS News that Mangione \"a good guy\" who \"didn't have any enemies.\" The former classmate said the two lost touch after high school, but said they felt sympathetic when they heard Mangione was a person of interest in the shooting.",
      "\"I don't think he is a crazy person,\" the former classmate said. \"I hope that there's a public trial and he gets the chance to explain how all of this happened in court.\"",
      "Mangione appeared isolated before his arrest",
      "In the months leading up to Mangione's arrest, posts tagging his account on the social media platform X indicate his friends may have been trying to contact him. His last post on the site was in June.",
      "\"Nobody has heard from you in months,\" one post from October read.",
      "Another post from July read, \"I don't know if you are okay or just in a super isolated place and have no service. But I haven't heard from you in months.\"",
      "Mangione traveled to Asia for several months in early 2024, according to social media posts and people who spoke to him at the time. He posted about his travels on Reddit in April, saying he had visited \"various countries\" during the past two months. Gurwinder Bhogal, who said he corresponded with Mangione via email and a video call during this time, said he believes Mangione was in Japan until at least early May.",
      "He reviewed Unabomber's manifesto, books about back pain",
      "On the book review site Goodreads, Mangione often reviewed and rated books. His activity there included a four-star rating and review of \"Industrial Society and Its Future,\" written by Theodore John Kaczynski, also known as the Unabomber.",
      "Two health-care-related books are on his read tab from 2022, including \"Crooked: Outwitting the Back Pain Industry and Getting on the Road to Recovery\" and \"Back Mechanic.\"",
      "Nehemiah, from Surfbreak, said that Mangione returned to Hawaii \"briefly in early 2023\" and started a book club. However, \"several members left due to discomfort in book choices.\" She did not elaborate on what those books were.",

      "Police say they were called to the DCA tower outside Washington, D.C., on Thursday because of a fight.  Officers arrested 39-year-old Damon Gaines of Upper Marlboro, Maryland, according to the Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority Police. He is facing charges of assault and battery.",

      "The union representing air traffic controllers who are typically the people working inside the Reagan control tower declined to comment.",
      "It is unclear what prompted the reported altercation, which comes as the situation at the DCA tower has been increasingly tense since a mid-air air collision in January killed 67 people in the deadliest U.S. aviation disaster since 2001. It also comes after a Delta Air Lines flight departing Reagan airport experienced a close call with an Air Force jet after taking off on Friday.",

    "story": [
      "Residents of the Badger State will have their last chance Tuesday to vote in an unusually high-stakes race for a seat on Wisconsin's Supreme Court.",
      "The election, which is officially nonpartisan, pits Dane County Judge Susan Crawford, who is backed by the Democratic Party, against Republican-endorsed Waukesha County Judge Brad Schimel in what has been the most expensive judicial election in American history. The campaigns and their supporters have spent more than $81 million, attracting endorsements and campaign appearances from Elon Musk, Vermont Democratic Sen. Bernie Sanders and other national political figures.",
      "The race is seen by some as an early swing-state test of voter sentiment related to President Trump's performance in the White House, but it's also a crucial statewide race that could swing ideological control of Wisconsin's closely divided highest court.",
      "Liberals currently hold a 4-3 majority, and the court is expected to consider cases related to abortion rights, congressional redistricting, union power and voting and election rules.",
      "By Monday morning, 644,800 advance ballots had been returned, representing about a 40% increase over the advance total in Wisconsin's 2023 judicial race, and that year also set a turnout record. About a third of advance ballots so far have come from heavily Democratic counties of Milwaukee and Dane, in the Madison area, and that's roughly in line with their share of the advance vote in 2023.",
      "Nineteen percent of advance ballots have come from the WOW counties in the Milwaukee suburbs of Waukesha, Ozaukee, and Washington, which is a couple of points higher than their share in 2023.",
      "Given that the more liberal candidate won the 2023 race by double digits, the early turnout numbers look good for Crawford. But the bulk of the voting is expected to occur on Election Day, when Schimel could very well close a gap.",
      "Musk, the world's wealthiest person and an ally to Mr. Trump, has personally campaigned and spent big in an effort to sway voters toward Schimel, who both he and Mr. Trump have endorsed.",
      "That effort nearly collided with the justices currently seated on the state's Supreme Court, when Musk was sued over his promise to hand out $1 million to individual voters at a campaign event over the weekend.",
      "The court unanimously declined on Sunday to hear a last-minute attempt by the state's Democratic attorney general to stop billionaire Musk's checks from going out. At a rally soon after the decision, Musk handed two people oversized posters depicting $1 million checks, declaring that the money was payment in exchange for promises they'd be spokespeople for his political group.",

    "story": [
      "Nearly all employees at the Institute of Museum and Library Services, an agency created by Congress to support American museums and libraries, were put on administrative leave Monday, according to a Trump administration official. An IMLS employee and a union representing them said all employees were put on leave, but an administration official said 20% of IMLS employees were not.",
      "The move still impacted about 80% of IMLS' roughly 77-employee staff.",
      "Earlier this month, President Trump signed an executive order calling for the agency, as well as six other governmental entities, to be reduced to \"the minimum presence.\" A few weeks ago, employees of the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, were spotted in the IMLS building in Washington, D.C., to attend the swearing in of the new acting commissioner, Deputy Labor Secretary Keith Sonderling.",
      "AFGE Local 3403, the union representing IMLS employees, said the notification to employees came after a \"brief meeting between DOGE staff and IMLS leadership.\" It said museums and libraries would no longer be able to contact IMLS staff for updates about their funding. The message also said the status of previously awarded grants is unclear, but that funding is likely to be terminated.",
      "IMLS has approximately 77 employees and was created by Congress as an independent federal agency in 1996 through the Museum and Library Services Act to support American museums and libraries. Last year, the institute awarded $267 million in grants across the country, with a focus on helping to organize book drives and museum field trips in areas without existing access to libraries or museums.",
      "EveryLibrary, an organization supporting libraries across the country, called the move to put employees on leave \"potentially devastating for institutions that depend on federal support to meet local needs.\"",
      "\"This is not merely a bureaucratic activity; it is a crisis for the library, museum, and archive communities across the United States,\" the group said in a statement.",
      "An email to IMLS employees Monday from the agency's human resources director stated there was no \"disciplinary purpose\" being served in putting these employees on administrative leave. The notice said email accounts would be disabled and instructs employees to leave laptops and work cellphones in the office, according to text of the email shared with CBS News.",
      "One employee said Sonderling's arrival at the agency seemed to signal that employees would soon be put on administrative leave. They have not been told what will happen to the agency, though one possibility entails shrinking the staff footprint to 30 employees and moving them to the Labor Department, according to the Federal News Network.",
      "A White House official said the restructuring \"is a necessary step\" to fulfill Mr. Trump's executive order and would ensure \"hard-earned tax dollars are not diverted to discriminatory DEI initiatives or divisive anti-American programming in our cultural institutions.\"",
      "\"These changes will strengthen IMLS's ability to serve the American people with integrity and purpose,\" they added.",
      "Mr. Trump also signed an executive order this month that targeted funding for the Smithsonian Institution programs that haves what he characterizeds as \"divisive, race-centered ideology.\"",
      "A bipartisan group of senators, including Republican Senators Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Susan Collins of Maine, have previously called for the agency to retain its federal funding and responsibilities under the Museum and Library Services Act of 2018, which Mr. Trump signed in his first term.",
      "\"We write to remind the Administration of its obligation to faithfully execute the provisions of the law as authorized,\" the senators wrote in a letter to Sonderling. \"IMLS grants enable libraries to develop services in every community throughout the nation, including people of diverse geographic, cultural, and socioeconomic backgrounds, individuals with disabilities, residents of rural and urban areas, Native Americans, military families, veterans, and caregivers.\"",

      "More than 400 Americans die annually from unintentional carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning, more than 100,000 visit the emergency room and more than 14,000 are hospitalized, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "Poisoning occurs when breathing in CO fumes prevents the body from getting enough oxygen, which can harm the brain, heart and other organs, according to Johns Hopkins.",
      "The dangers of carbon monoxide are back in headlines as Costa Rican officials say Miller Gardner, the son of former Yankees outfielder Brett Gardner, may have died from carbon monoxide poisoning in a hotel room where the family was staying in March. And authorities in Belize said three American women who were found dead in their hotel room in February had\u00a0died of carbon monoxide poisoning.",
      "Here's what to know to protect yourself.",
      "What causes carbon monoxide?",
      "Carbon monoxide is produced any time a fossil fuel is burned, meaning accidental poisoning can occur when home appliances and systems like furnaces, kerosene heaters, stoves, lanterns and generators produce fumes that people breathe in.",
      "Most CO exposures happen in the winter in cold climates because of unvented space heaters in the home, a common source of CO poisoning. Cases sometimes occur after hurricanes or other storms when people are relying on generators for emergency power that may not be vented properly.",
      "Where to put carbon monoxide detector?",
      "While CO poisoning can be fatal, it is also preventable with the use of CO detector devices. Detector can range between $20 for basic models to $100 for digital, low-level detectors.",
      "The\u00a0U.S. Environmental Protection Agency recommends each floor of the home have a separate CO detector.",
      "\"If you are getting a single detector, place it near the sleeping areas and make certain the alarm is loud enough to wake you up,\" the EPA notes.",
      "In addition to detectors, the CDC, Mayo Clinic, Johns Hopkins and other public safety advocates have a number of other recommendations, including:",
      "Car safety:\u00a0Don't run a car in an enclosed area like a garage. Even if the garage door is open, don't start a vehicle if the garage is attached to a home.",
      "Furnace and fireplaces:\u00a0Keep fireplaces clean and in good condition, make sure no debris is blocking the vents or chimney.",
      "Fuel-burning space heaters: Make sure heating systems, water heaters, and any other gas, oil, or coal burning appliances are cleaned and serviced every year, and make sure they're in well-ventilated areas. Johns Hopkins suggests opting for electrical space heaters, which pose no danger of carbon monoxide poisoning.",
      "Gas stoves and ovens: Never use these for heating a room.",
      "Portable generators: Never use generators inside a home or garage, even if doors and windows are open. Instead, place them outside more than 20 feet away from any windows, doors or vents.",

      "\"If you breathe in a lot of CO, it can make you pass out or kill you. People who are sleeping or drunk can die from CO poisoning before they have symptoms,\" the CDC warns.",
      "Anyone can be at risk for CO poisoning, but infants, the elderly and people with chronic heart disease, anemia or breathing problems are more likely to get sick, according to multiple health organizations.",
      "If you are experiencing these symptoms, get to fresh air and seek emergency care immediately, the organizations advise.",
      "Travel carbon monoxide detector",
      "It's also important to be aware of carbon monoxide while traveling, since some accommodations, from hotel rooms to home rentals, especially abroad, may not have appropriate safety measures in place.",
      "In 2022, multiple Americans in two separate incidents died from suspected carbon monoxide poisoning while traveling, bringing a spotlight to the issue. Three tourists were\u00a0staying at an apartment\u00a0in Mexico City,\u00a0reportedly\u00a0booked through Airbnb, while another group was at a Sandals Resort in the Bahamas.",
      "A spokesperson for Sandals Resorts confirmed to CBS MoneyWatch at the time that Sandals has carbon monoxide detectors in all rooms across its facilities. Airbnb started offering hosts free carbon monoxide detectors for units that don't already have the devices installed. Airbnb said it encourages its hosts to install detectors but does not require them. Guests can check if a rental has detectors by checking the \"safety devices\" section of the listing.",
      "Hyperbaric medicine specialist Dr. Andrew Moffat previously told CBS MoneyWatch he always travels with a portable detector.",
      "\"I bring my own carbon monoxide monitor with me everywhere I stay,\" he said. Moffatt cautioned that survivors of CO poisoning can suffer debilitating long-term effects like chronic anxiety and cognitive issues, and that many detectors don't go off until CO levels are so elevated that they damage the brain.",

      "Hegseth, in Tokyo on Sunday, called Japan an \"indispensable partner\" in deterring Chinese assertiveness and announced an upgrade of the U.S. military command in Japan to a new \"war-fighting headquarters.\" He stressed the need for the U.S. and Japan to do more to strengthen their military capability as the region faces China's rising assertiveness in its myriad territorial disputes in the region.",
      "\"Japan is our indispensable partner in deterring Communist Chinese military aggression,\" Hegseth said at the beginning of his talks with Japan's Defense Minister Gen Nakatani in Tokyo. \"The U.S. is moving fast, as you know, to reestablish deterrence in this region and around the world.\"",
      "Hegseth's visit came amid concern in Japan about how U.S. engagement in the region could change under President Trump's \"America First\" policy, Japanese defense officials said, speaking on condition of anonymity, citing protocol. Mr. Trump has threatened to impose trade tariffs on Japan, a key U.S. ally, sparking more concern.",
      "The two sides agreed to accelerate plans to jointly develop and produce missiles such as Advanced Medium-Range Air to Air Missiles, or MRAAM, and consider producing SM-6 surface-to-air missiles, to help ease a shortage of munitions, Nakatani said. The ministers also agreed to speed up the process involving the maintenance of U.S. warships and warplanes in Japan to strengthen and complement Japanese and U.S. defense industries.",

      "Taiwan has set up a central response group to monitor the latest exercises, Koo said.",
      "The drills come just two weeks after a large-scale exercise in mid-March, when Beijing sent a large number of drones and ships toward the island.",
      "China's Taiwan Affairs Office said the exercises were directed at Lai Ching-te, Taiwan's strongly pro-independence president.",
      "\"Lai Ching-te stubbornly insists on a 'Taiwan independence' stance, brazenly labeling the mainland as a 'foreign hostile force,' and has put forward a so-called \"17-point strategy ... stirring up anti-China sentiments,\" said China's Taiwan Affairs Office in a statement on Tuesday. \"We will not tolerate or condone this in any way and must resolutely counter and severely punish these actions.\"",

      "Lai's words and actions appear to have especially angered Chinese leader Xi Jinping, whose previous attempts at intimidation have had little effect on the Taiwanese public.

      "OIJ Director R\u00e1ndall Z\u00fa\u00f1iga said Monday that a team testing the family's hotel room found high levels of carbon monoxide, and that the room where they stayed was situated next to \"a specialized machine room\" that could have caused the contamination. The test results led the OIJ's investigators to believe Gardner \"may have died from inhaling these highly dangerous gases,\" Z\u00fa\u00f1iga said in a video statement in Spanish.",
      "\"It is also important to highlight that this entire investigation has been closely coordinated with the United States FBI, and we await the final results of the forensic toxicology to determine exactly what caused this young man's death,\" Z\u00fa\u00f1iga said.",

We trust that the forensic process will objectively, clearly, and conclusively clarify the causes of this unfortunate incident.\"",

      "Carbon monoxide\u00a0is an odorless, colorless gas that is produced when fossil fuels are burned.

Thai authorities have ordered an investigation into that isolated collapse to determine whether it could have been due to inadequate building materials, design flaws or a failure in the inspections process.",

    "story": [
      "Marine Le Pen, the figurehead of the ascendant far-right political movement in France, was hit with a non-custodial prison sentence and barred from running in elections for five years on Monday as a court found her guilty of embezzling European Union funds to pay members of her National Rally party's staff. In handing down the sentence, the judge said the public office ban would take effect immediately.",
      "\"The court took into consideration, in addition to the risk of reoffending, the major disturbance of public order if a person already convicted ... was a candidate in the presidential election,\" judge Benedicte de Perthuis, was quoted as saying by the French news agency AFP.",
      "De Perthuis also sentenced Le Pen to four years in prison but said that part of her sentence would be served as house arrest, with her wearing an electronic tag, not in a prison. The judge suspended two of the four years of the prison sentence. He also fined her more than $100,000.",
      "Le Pen, speaking to French TV channel TF1 in her first reaction to the verdict, said she would appeal and called the ruling a \"political\" move aimed at preventing her from running in the 2027 presidential election.",
      "She said the court should not have made her ineligible to run for office until all her chances at appeal had been exhausted.",
      "\"If that's not a political decision, I don't know what is,\" she said.",
      "Le Pen would remain ineligible to be a candidate until the appeal is decided, but the house arrest and fine would be suspended during the appeals process.",
      "Le Pen said she would ask that the court proceedings take place before the 2027 campaign. Only an appellate ruling that overturns the ban on public office could restore her hopes of running. But, there's no guarantee that an appeals court would rule more favorably, and appeals in France can take several years to conclude.",
      "Rodolphe Bosselut, Le Pen's lawyer, said he was \"appalled\" by the court's decision, calling it \"extremely scandalous.\" He also vowed to launch an appeal against the guilty verdict.",
      "Recent polling has shown Le Pen likely would have won at least a first round in France's next national election, though it is much less clear how she would have fared in a second round against a more moderate candidate.",
      "Far-right political figures across Europe \u2014 including the Netherlands' Geert Wilders and Italy's Matteo Salvini\u00a0\u2014 condemned the verdict Monday.",
      "In Russia, meanwhile, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov claimed Le Pen's sentencing was evidence of European nations \"going down the path of trampling over democratic norms.\"",
      "\"Of course, we do not want to interfere in France's internal affairs, we have never done so, and this is France's internal affair,\" said Peskov, \"but in general, our observations of European capitals show that they are not at all reluctant to go beyond democracy during the political process.\"",
      "Le Pen, 56, garnered 41% of the ballots in the last French presidential election in 2022 \u2014 beaten decisively by current President Emmanuel Macron \u2014 and she has made no secret of her desire to run again for the nation's highest office.",
      "Sat in the front row of the Paris court, Le Pen whispered \"incredible\" as the judge detailed his reasoning for the guilty verdict. She walked out of the court before the sentences were announced.",
      "Le Pen, along with eight current or former party members, had faced up to 10 years in prison on the embezzlement charges. A dozen others who served as parliamentary aides for the National Rally party, formerly the National Front, also received guilty verdicts for their role in the scheme.",
      "The judge said Le Pen and her colleagues did not enrich themselves personally but called the embezzlement \"a democratic bypass\" that duped the French parliament and voters. He said Le Pen was at the center of \"a system\" used to siphon off EU money intended to pay EU parliamentary aides, to instead pay party staff between 2004 and 2016.",
      "Le Pen has denied any wrongdoing, claiming prosecutors were \"only interested\" in barring her from the presidential election. She told La Tribune Dimanche\u00a0newspaper on Sunday, before the verdict was handed down, that the judges had \"the right of life or death over our movement.\"",

In the interview, Mr. Trump said he sent the letter \"yesterday,\" but the exact timing remained unclear.",
      "\"I would rather negotiate a deal. I'm not sure that everybody agrees with me, but we can make a deal that would be just as good as if you won militarily,\" Mr. Trump said in a clip from the interview, which was shared by the network ahead of its full airing this weekend, Fox said.",
      "\"But the time is happening now. The time is coming up,\" Mr. Trump said. \"Something's going to happen one way or the other. I hope that Iran \u2014 and I've written him a letter, saying, 'I hope you're going to negotiate.' Because if we have to go in militarily, it's going to be a terrible thing \u2014 for them.\"",
      "In the interview, Mr. Trump said he believed Iran wanted \"to get that letter,\" adding that \"the other alternative is, we have to do something. Because you can't let them have a nuclear weapon.\"",
      "Iranian media reported that on Wednesday a letter from Mr. Trump was delivered to Tehran by a senior United Arab Emirates diplomat, the French news agency AFP said.",
      "Late last week Iran's state-run media said that no letter had been received from Mr. Trump, and Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi told the French news agency AFP on Friday that Iran would not negotiate with the U.S. while heavy U.S. sanctions against the country remain in place.",
      "A\u00a0report last month\u00a0by the United Nations nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency, said Iran had \"significantly increased production and accumulation of high enriched uranium,\" marking a progression in the country's nuclear program since Mr. Trump was reelected.",
      "In 2018, during Mr. Trump's first term, he unilaterally withdrew the United States from a negotiated deal with Iran and other world powers that was aimed at curbing the country's nuclear program. Mr. Trump imposed a wide range of new sanctions on Iran at the time, calling it a policy of \"maximum pressure\" to force Tehran to broker a new deal. That policy has decimated Iran's economy, but there have been no new negotiations between the two sides acknowledged publicly since.",
      "Under the original nuclear deal, Iran was permitted to enrich uranium up to 3.67% purity and maintain a stockpile of no more than 661 pounds at that level. At that purity, uranium can be used for medical, research and other civilian purposes, but not to build a nuclear weapon.",
      "The most recent IAEA report found Iran was enriching more uranium to 60% purity \u2014 much closer to the level required for weapons, which is about 90%, and a level at which it was only confirmed to have started enriching after Mr. Trump pulled the U.S. out of the nuclear agreement. Its stockpile of that highly enriched uranium had risen as of February to about 606 pounds, according to the IAEA report.",
      "Iran has long insisted its nuclear program is for entirely peaceful purposes, as tension has continued to rise with the U.S. over its sanctions, and with Israel over its war against the Iranian-backed, U.S.-designated terrorist group Hamas.",
      "Last August, Khamenei said there was \"no harm\" in engagement with the U.S., but more recently he said negotiations would not be \"intelligent, wise or honorable.\"",

      "Mr. Trump's overture comes as both Israel and the U.S. have warned they will never let Iran acquire a nuclear weapon, leading to fears of a military confrontation as Tehran enriches uranium at near weapons-grade levels \u2013 something only done by atomic-armed nations.",
      "Iran has long maintained its program is for peaceful purposes, even as its officials increasingly threaten to pursue the bomb as tensions are high with the U.S. over its sanctions and after the collapse of a ceasefire in Israel's\u00a0war against Hamas in the Gaza Strip.",
      "As the U.S. conducts intense airstrikes targeting the Iranian-backed Houthi rebels of Yemen, the risk of military action targeting Iran's nuclear program remains on the table.",

      "Mr. Trump's first term in office was marked by a particularly troubled period in relations with Tehran. In 2018, he unilaterally withdrew the United States from Iran's nuclear deal with world powers, leading to sanctions hobbling Iran's economy. Iran retaliated with attacks at sea \u2014 including one that it likely carried out and that temporarily halved Saudi Arabia's oil production.",

      "Sophie Chandauka, the chair of Sentebale, a charity Harry co-founded in 2006 that was long aimed at helping children in southern Africa who have HIV/AIDS, took several shots at Harry on Sky News.

The stalemate reportedly involved a change in the organization's mission.",
      "\"It is devastating that the relationship between the charity's trustees and the chair of the board broke down beyond repair, creating an untenable situation,\" the princes said in their statement. \"What's transpired is unthinkable. We are in shock that we have to do this, but we have a continued responsibility to Sentebale's beneficiaries, so we will be sharing all of our concerns with the Charity Commission as to how this came about.\"",
      "Chandauka sued the charity in order to remain in her position, according to the statement. She said that she reported Sentebale's trustees to the Charity Commission in the U.K. and filed papers in a British court to prevent her removal.",
      "She alleged there was misconduct at the charity without naming anyone or offering any details in a statement Tuesday. It said she had tried to blow the whistle on \"abuse of power, bullying, harassment, misogyny and misogynoir,\" the latter word referring to a combination of racism and misogyny directed toward Black women.",

      "A source familiar with the events rejected that claim, telling CBS News that both Harry and Seeiso had sent a joint resignation letter to the chair as well as trustees on March 10. A source close to trustees and patrons of the charity told CBS News that Chandauka's \"publicity stunt\" had been expected, and that the princes' collective decision to step down was taken with it in mind.",

      "The charity, whose name means \"don't forget me\" in the Sesotho language of Lesotho and South Africa, was founded to help youths affected by AIDS in the small mountainous nation and in Botswana. But it is now moving to address youth health, wealth and climate resilience across southern Africa.",
      "The biggest risk to the charity was the \"toxicity of its lead patron's brand,\" Chandauka argued in an interview with the Financial Times.",
      "In the Sky interview, she said a polo fundraiser scheduled in Miami last year almost fell apart when Harry asked to bring a camera crew along to film for a Netflix series he was shooting.",
      "The cost of the venue skyrocketed when it became a commercial venture and they scrambled to find another host, which Harry arranged through his connections, she said. Meghan's surprise appearance at the event led to an awkward moment during the trophy presentation after the match, Chandauka said.",
      "In a video clip circulated on social media, Chandauka tried to pose next to the duke as he held the trophy in one hand and had his other wrapped around Meghan. But the duchess appeared to gesture that Chandauka move farther from Harry, forcing her to duck under the silver cup to get into the photo.",
      "\"The international press captured this, and there was a lot of talk about the duchess and the choreography on stage and whether she should have been there and her treatment of me,\" Chandauka said.",

      "Officers recently confiscated nearly 6.5 tons of cocaine from a semi-submersible vessel, or so-called \"narco sub,\" intercepted off the Azores while bound for the Iberian peninsula, Portugal's judicial police said.",
      "The bust, dubbed Operation Nautilus, amounts to nearly a quarter of the record 23 tons seized across the whole of 2024 in Portugal, often considered one of the first points of entry for the drug into Europe. Drug traffickers have been caught using semi-submersible vessels to smuggle cocaine while attempting to evade detection.",
      "The vessel was intercepted \"in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean, around 500 nautical miles\" south of Portugal's Azores archipelago, the judicial police statement said.",
      "Five crew members were onboard the vessel, which was used by an international crime ring, the statement added.\u00a0Police released video of the operation, showing the vessel loaded with orange packages as well as four suspects with their faces blurred out.",
      "Besides the Portuguese navy and air force, international partners including the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, the British National Crime Agency and the Spanish Guardia Civil contributed to the bust, according the police.",
      "Portuguese police said that the operation happened recently, without specifying the date.",
      "Many \"narco subs\" cannot fully dive like a true submarine, but some are able to dip completely underwater.",
      "Most of the cocaine smuggled into Portugal comes across the sea from Latin America.",

      "In January, a\u00a0\"narco sub\"\u00a0broke in two pieces as a fishing boat was towing it to a port in northwestern Spain. In November, the\u00a0Mexican Navy said\u00a0it seized about 8,000 pounds of cocaine aboard a \"narco sub\" about 150 miles off the\u00a0resort of Acapulco. In September, the U.S. Coast Guard said that it had offloaded more than $54 million worth of cocaine \u2014 including over 1,200 pounds of drugs that were seized from a \"narco sub.\"",

      "A unilateral partial ceasefire to facilitate earthquake relief efforts was announced on Saturday by Myanmar's shadow National Unity Government, which coordinates the popular struggle against the ruling military. The country's death toll from the disaster soared to 1,644.",
      "The figure was a sharp rise compared to the 1,002 announced just hours earlier, highlighting the difficulty of confirming casualties over a widespread region and the likelihood that the numbers will continue to grow from Friday's 7.7 magnitude quake. The number of injured increased to 3,408, while the missing figure rose to 139.",
      "In neighboring Thailand, the death toll rose to 17. The quake rocked the greater Bangkok area, home to around 17 million people, and other parts of the country. Many places in the north reported damage, but the only casualties were reported in Bangkok.",
      "Of the death toll, 10 were killed in the high rise building near famous Chatuchak market that collapsed, while the rest were killed in seven other sites. Authorities in Bangkok said 83 people were unaccounted for.",

      "But even though teams and equipment have been flown in from other nations, they are hindered by damage to airports. Satellite photos from Planet Labs PBC analyzed by The Associated Press show that the earthquake toppled the air traffic control tower at Naypyitaw International Airport as if sheered from its base.",
      "It wasn't immediately clear if there had been any casualties from its collapse.",

      "In the capital Naypyidaw, crews worked Saturday to repair damaged roads, while electricity, phone and internet services remained down for most of the city. The earthquake brought down many buildings, including multiple units that housed government civil servants, but that section of the city was blocked off by authorities on Saturday.",

      "Nine of the fatalities were at the site of the collapsed high-rise under construction near Bangkok's Chatuchak market, while 78 people were still unaccounted for.",
      "On Saturday, more heavy equipment was brought in to move the tons of rubble, but hope was fading among friends and family members of the missing that they would be found alive.",

      "\"People are in the jungle and I was out in the jungle when the earthquake hit \u2014 it was powerful, but the trees just moved, that was it for us, so we haven't had a direct impact other than that the Burma army keeps attacking, even after the quake,\" he said.",

Critics also raised questions about the movie's biblical and historical accuracy. In addition, \"The Passion of the Christ\" was accused of being antisemitic due to its portrayals of Jewish leaders and their roles in Jesus' death.",
      "However, the public interest that was generated by the controversies surrounding the movie has also been credited with contributing to its success, and PR expert Steve Honig told Fox News Digital that history may repeat itself with the sequel.",

      "\"Moviegoers will be curious about the film and that may be enough to get them to see the movie, or at least read the reviews and let that guide them,\" Honig said. \"At the end of the day, and ironically, it may be controversy over the film that drives people into the theater.\"",
      "Despite achieving massive success as both an actor and director, Gibson himself has been embroiled in a number of controversies over the years due to legal troubles and inflammatory statements he made both publicly and in leaked conversations.",
      "Two years after \"The Passion of the Christ\" was released, Gibson notoriously unleashed an antisemitic tirade on a Jewish law enforcement officer when he was arrested for driving under the influence in July 2006.",
      "He later apologized to the Jewish community for his \"vitriolic and harmful words\" that he said were \"blurted out in a moment of insanity.\" The \"Conspiracy Theory\" star subsequently entered rehab.",
      "In 2010, Gibson faced backlash again over leaked voicemails in which he could be heard using racist and misogynistic language directed at then-girlfriend Oksana Grigorieva. Gibson entered a \"no contest\" plea to a misdemeanor charge of domestic battery against her the following year.",

      "\"The question here is, has Mel Gibson gotten through all the controversy that has surrounded him for so long? In some ways, time does heal all wounds, however, in other ways, it\u2019s hard for many people to forgive and forget,\" he said.",
      "Honig continued, \"We\u2019re living in a very fragmented society right now so there will likely be a strong segment of the population who embrace the film and others who will push it aside.\"",
      "Gibson, who was recently named a special ambassador to Hollywood by President Trump, first confirmed that he was working on a sequel to \"The Passion of the Christ\" in 2016.",

      "While \"The Passion of the Christ\" followed the last 12 hours of Jesus' life leading up to the crucifixion, Gibson said the sequel will focus on his\u00a0resurrection.",

      "During a January appearance on \"The Joe Rogan Experience,\" Gibson reflected on the challenges that he faced while making \"The Passion,\" which he self-financed through his company Icon Productions.",
      "\"There was a lot of opposition to it,\" Gibson recalled. \"I think if you ever hit on this subject matter, you're going to get people going.\"",
      "He continued, \"It's a big subject matter, and my contention was, when I was making it, it was like, you're making this film. And the idea was that we're all responsible for this, that his sacrifice was for all mankind, and for all our ills and all the things in our fallen nature. It was a redemption.\"",
      "Gibson also shared details about \"The Resurrection\" and the themes that the movie will explore.",
      "LIKE WHAT YOU\u2019RE READING? CLICK HERE FOR MORE ENTERTAINMENT NEWS",
      "\"I'm going to try and tackle this question,\" he said. \"That there are big realms, spiritual realms. There's good, there's evil, and they are slugging it out for the souls of mankind. And my question is, \u2018Why are we even important, little old, flawed humanity? Why are we important in that process where the big realms are slugging it out over us?\u2019\"",
      "\"And I think there's bigger things at play here,\" Gibson continued. \"And institutions that purport to touch on the divine are necessarily going to be affected by that slugfest that's going on between good and evil.\"",
      "\"The Resurrection\" will be set over the three days after the crucifixion. (Mary Evans/Ronald Grant/Everett Collection)",

      "\"There\u2019s a lot required because it\u2019s an acid trip. I\u2019ve never read anything like it,\" he told Rogan. \"My brother and I and Randall all sort of congregated on this. So there\u2019s some good heads put together, but there\u2019s some crazy stuff.\"",
      "\"And I think in order to really tell the story properly you have to really start with the fall of the angels, which means you\u2019re in another place, you\u2019re in another realm,\" he continued. \"You need to go to hell. You need to go to Sheol.\"",
      "CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR THE ENTERTAINMENT NEWSLETTER",
      "\"You got to have his origin,\" Gibson added. \"I have ideas about how to do that and how to evoke things about to depict that. I\u2019ve been thinking about that for a long time. It\u2019s going to require a lot of planning. I\u2019m not sure I can pull it off. It\u2019s super ambitious, but I\u2019m going to take a crack at it.\"",
      "\"It\u2019s about trying to find a way in that\u2019s not cheesy or obvious. It\u2019s almost like a magic trick,\" he said. \"It took a long time to write. It's very ambitious. It goes from the fall of the angels to the death of the last apostle.\"",
      "Gibson confirmed that he plans for Caviezel to reprise his role as Jesus. However, he noted that de-aging and CGI techniques will be needed because the movie is set over the three days after the events of \"The Passion\" but more than 20 years have passed since the first film.",
      "The director explained that the movie's dialogue will likely be in English, unlike \"The Passion,\" which was entirely in Aramaic, Hebrew and Latin with subtitles.",
      "\"I don't know that you can do it in a foreign language because the concepts are too difficult now,\" Gibson said.",

      "Doug Eldridge of Achilles PR, shared his thoughts on the likelihood of the success of \"The Resurrection,\" telling Fox News Digital that Gibson's interview with Rogan was \"really insightful.\"",
      "\"He described the opposition to the concept behind \u2018The Passion,\u2019 as well as Hollywood's reluctance to embrace it, even after it was a runaway hit,\" Eldrige said. \"The first time around, he took the most incredible story \u2013 but also, the most difficult to portray \u2013 and he did it in a brutally beautiful way.\"",
      "He continued, \"To follow up on something like that would be like following an A+ on a test in grade school; there's no way you can surpass it, the best you can possibly do is equal it, and even then, that's a heavy lift and a tall order.\"",
      "\"For comparison, \u2018Gladiator\u2019 was one of the most acclaimed films of all time: incredible acting, beautiful score, amazing story, and a perfect ending. What did they do? They made a sequel 24 years later and it bombed. That's not to say Gibson's sequel will suffer the same fate, but it's hard to follow a 'best in class' production with a sequel that meets audience expectations,\" Eldridge added.",

      "A new blood test has emerged that can gauge how far Alzheimer's disease has progressed, according to researchers. (iStock)",
      "The researchers analyzed blood samples for 163 people who were experiencing various levels of cognitive decline, from presymptomatic to early-stage to late-stage dementia.",
      "They found that levels of a protein called MTBR-tau243 correlate to the amount of tau that has accumulated in the brain, according to a WashU press release. Accuracy compared to brain scans was 92%.",
      "The greater amount of tau accumulation, the more severe the Alzheimer\u2019s symptoms.",
      "Levels of MTBR-tau243 were normal in people who did not yet have symptoms, which indicates that the protein is associated with more advanced stages.",
      "Levels were also normal for people whose symptoms were linked to another cause other than Alzheimer\u2019s.",
      "What to know about tau",
      "Tau is a protein that clumps together and forms \"tangles\" in the brains of people who have Alzheimer\u2019s, per Healthline. These tangles interfere with cognitive function.",
      "Tau tangles typically form years after the formation of another protein called amyloid, which creates plaques in the brain and is one of the first hallmarks of Alzheimer\u2019s.",
      "The greater the amount of tau accumulation, the more severe the Alzheimer\u2019s symptoms\u00a0\u2014 it was 200 times higher for those in later dementia stages, the study found.",
      "PET (positron emission tomography)\u00a0brain scans are now the standard for staging, but they have some drawbacks, the researchers noted. (iStock)",
      "\"Amyloid plaques and tau tangles together define the basic\u00a0biological brain changes of Alzheimer\u2019s disease, along with the loss of brain cells and synapses,\" Courtney Kloske, Ph.D., director of scientific engagement at the Alzheimer\u2019s Association in Chicago, told Fox News Digital. \"These changes cause the well-known memory and thinking symptoms of dementia.\"",
      "While previously developed blood tests measure levels of amyloid plaques in the brain, this is the first one to measure tau levels.",
      "TWO ALZHEIMER\u2019S DRUGS HELP PATIENTS LIVE INDEPENDENTLY AT HOME FOR LONGER PERIODS",
      "\"To aid in early detection, we have seen advances in blood tests for amyloid, which have been shown to be highly accurate and are now available to aid clinicians in their diagnostic workup,\" said Kloske.",
      "\"The current study is looking at the accuracy of a blood test for tau; once these blood tests are developed, confirmed and validated, positive results on both tests would strongly confirm Alzheimer\u2019s disease as the cause of the person\u2019s dementia. This makes for a more confident and definitive diagnosis and clarifies\u00a0options for treatment.\"",
      "\"This blood test clearly identifies Alzheimer\u2019s tau tangles, which is our best biomarker measure of Alzheimer\u2019s symptoms and dementia,\" a researcher said. (iStock)",

      "Looking ahead",
      "The hope is that this new blood test could make it easier to stage Alzheimer\u2019s patients and tailor treatments to their individual needs.",
      "PET (positron emission tomography)\u00a0brain scans are now the standard for staging, but they have some drawbacks, the researchers noted.",

    "summary": "",
    "story": [
      "Health care took center stage during the Covid-19 pandemic.\u00a0 And in the five years since, the industry has experienced change and innovation.",
      "The field of medicine has undergone significant changes since the COVID-19 pandemic, with the biggest breakthrough right at our fingertips: telemedicine.\u00a0 While it may feel like a \"normal\" part of healthcare now, connected technology dominated how Americans saw doctors during the pandemic. \"Before the pandemic, virtual care was available, but it was not widely used. Now telemedicine is mainstream,\" says Dr. Michael Aziz, an Attending Physician at New York's Lenox Hill Hospital.",
      "According to one study, telemedicine encounters increased 766% in the first three months of the COVID outbreak. And while use of the 2-D technology has tapered off, Dr. Aziz, believes still plays a vital role in medical care, \"Especially for people in rural areas. Especially for young professionals. And it offers convenience. But we have so many barriers when it comes to telemedicine.... especially for senior citizens,\u2019 he explains, \"Also, the government has put some many roadblocks for patients to use that. One is the cost. There's a cost associated with that. It's not covered by many insurance.\"",
      "Experts say while telemedicine has been revolutionary, it's best suited for certain ailments, particularly psychiatric services.\u00a0 Dr. Chris Ivany, Psychiatrist and COO of Family Care Center, emphasizes, \"I think it's clear to say that the pandemic certainly had a immediate and negative effect on many Americans' mental health.\"",
      "A recent Gallup poll shows adults 18 to 49 reported a steep drop in their mental health since 2020, with many suffering from depression, anxiety, and isolation.\u00a0 This has led to an increase in Americans seeking help post-crisis.\u00a0 Dr. Ivany notes, \"The stigma to seeking mental health care is definitely decreased over the course of the past five or so years.... but also, in part to just a general recognition that mental health care is part of health care overall.\"\u00a0 Dr. Ivany points to two main reasons we're seeing a growth in mental health care, \"Part of what the pandemic has done is to raise the awareness of mental health issues, challenges across the American population in a way that really hadn't been done really in the past.... And I think the second is the field now is much more flexible in terms of how care can be delivered to people.\"",
      "Another challenge changing the landscape of the industry, a significant reduction in staffing. Dr. Aziz says, \"About 3000 healthcare professionals have died and about 100,000 have retired or changed career... Hospitals have a hard time not only hiring physicians and health care workers, but they have a hard time retaining them.\"",
      "While telemedicine has been a game changer, it\u2019s not the only major innovation to emerge from the pandemic. The production and rollout of the COVID-19 vaccine, along with advancements in rapid testing and antigen tests, are also transformative innovations born out of the pandemic."

      "\"I was surprised that both mothers and fathers favored daughters,\" the researcher said. \"We thought fathers would favor sons.\"",
      "One reason could be evolutionary, he surmised. \"In many past societies, sons were a safety net of sorts as parents aged. Sons could provide material resources to help them.\"",
      "\"Parents should work on being open to hearing the perspective of their kids without being defensive.\"",
      "In modern western societies, daughters are much more likely to care for aging parents, Jensen noted.",
      "\"In that way, parents may be storing up \u2018social capital\u2019 with their daughters, with the potential of the daughters providing care later on.\"",
      "During childhood, he said, sons are more inclined to play outdoors in larger groups, and daughters indoors with smaller groups.",
      "Birth order appears to be a factor, with the youngest siblings often getting preferential treatment.\u00a0 (iStock)",
      "\"Over the past several decades, parents have become less and less inclined to allow their kids to play outdoors without supervision,\" Jensen told Fox News Digital. \"Daughters may, on average, be more suited to current parenting culture, and thus easier to parent.\"",

      "While updating Chrome should fix the vulnerability, below are some security tips you can follow to further bolster your privacy and security.",
      "1) Have strong antivirus software:\u00a0Hackers often gain access to devices by sending infected emails or documents or by tricking you into clicking a link that downloads malware. You can avoid all of this by installing strong antivirus software that will detect any potential threat before it can take over your device.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "2) Enable two-factor authentication (2FA):\u00a0Many online accounts, including Google, offer two-factor authentication as an extra security measure.\u00a0Enabling 2FA ensures that even if a hacker obtains your password, they still need a second form of verification, such as a code sent to your phone, to access your account. This simple step significantly reduces the chances of unauthorized access.",
      "3) Use a secure password manager:\u00a0A strong password is crucial, but remembering multiple complex passwords can be difficult. A password manager generates, stores and autofills strong passwords for your accounts, reducing the risk of password-related breaches. Avoid using the same password across different sites and always opt for long, unique passwords. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 here.",
      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "This incident serves as yet another reminder that even the most secure systems are never truly invulnerable, especially when state-backed or highly skilled actors are in play. While Google\u2019s quick response is commendable, it also highlights the never-ending cat-and-mouse game between security teams and cybercriminals. If you are using Chrome, update it now.",

      "Tech expert Kurt Knutsson joins \"Fox & Friends\" to warn of new cyberscams and his tips on how to avoid them.",
      "Phishing attacks are everywhere, and most of us can spot the obvious ones. Even if someone falls for one and hands over their password, two-factor authentication (2FA) usually adds a crucial layer of protection. But a new phishing kit making the rounds can bypass 2FA entirely by using session hijacking and real-time credential interception.",
      "Known as Astaroth, this tool intercepts and manipulates traffic between your device and legitimate authentication services like Gmail, Yahoo and Microsoft. Since it grabs everything in real time, it completely bypasses 2FA and gives attackers full access to your account.",

      "Illustration of a hacker at work (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How Astaroth works",
      "Astaroth is a next-level phishing kit that takes scamming to a whole new level. Instead of using basic fake login pages like traditional phishing kits, it works as a middleman between your device and the real authentication service while silently grabbing everything needed to break in.",
      "The attack begins when you click on a phishing link and land on a malicious site that looks identical to the real one. Since the site has valid SSL certificates, there are no red flags, no security warnings and no sketchy pop-ups. When you enter your login details, including username, password, device info and IP address, Astaroth snatches them up before passing the request to the actual website.",
      "Two-factor authentication is not a problem for Astaroth. It intercepts one-time passwords the second they are entered, whether they come from an authenticator app, SMS or a push notification. The stolen codes are instantly sent to the attacker through a web panel or Telegram alert, so they can use them before they expire.",
      "The real kicker is that Astaroth also grabs session cookies, which are the small bits of data that keep users logged in after authentication. Attackers can inject these cookies into their own browsers, skipping the need for passwords or two-factor authentication altogether. Once they have the session, they are in with no extra steps required.",

      "BEST ANTIVIRUS FOR MAC, PC, IPHONES AND ANDROIDS - CYBERGUY PICKS",
      "Astaroth is shockingly advanced",
      "As reported by cybersecurity company\u00a0SlashNext, Astaroth stands out from other phishing kits because of its ability to intercept credentials in real time, automate attacks and resist takedown efforts. Traditional phishing depends on tricking victims into entering their credentials on fake login pages, but Astaroth removes that step entirely.",
      "Beyond its advanced capabilities, Astaroth comes with features that make it appealing to cybercriminals. It uses bulletproof hosting to stay online despite law enforcement efforts, receives frequent updates to bypass security patches and follows a structured payment model. For $2,000, buyers get six months of continuous upgrades. To build trust, the creators even let hackers test the phishing kit before purchasing.",
      "Astaroth is widely available through Telegram and underground cybercrime forums. The anonymity of these platforms makes it difficult for authorities to track distribution.",

      "1) Avoid unknown links and use strong antivirus software: Remember that no matter how advanced the malware is, it still needs input from you. In most cases, an attacker will require you to click a link before they can steal your data. For example, for Astaroth to work, you have to click a link, visit a malicious website and enter your credentials. If you don\u2019t click the link, you stay clear of the malware.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS device.",
      "2) Double-check sites:\u00a0Always verify website addresses and use bookmarks for trusted sites. Instead of clicking on links in emails or messages, manually type the URL or use a trusted bookmark. This minimizes the risk of landing on a fraudulent page designed to mimic a legitimate website.",
      "3) Update your devices:\u00a0You might wonder how keeping your devices updated helps against malware like Astaroth. While it doesn\u2019t directly prevent an attack, it ensures the situation doesn\u2019t get worse.\u00a0Keeping your operating system and applications up to date with the latest security patches closes vulnerabilities that malware might exploit, making it harder for attackers to gain a foothold on your device.",
      "4) Avoid typing passwords:\u00a0Avoid entering passwords whenever possible to reduce the risk of credential theft. Instead, use authentication methods like passkeys, Google Sign-In or Apple Sign-In.",
      "A passkey is a feature that uses cryptographic key pairs to verify your identity, eliminating the need for traditional passwords. It allows you to sign in to apps and websites using the same process you use to unlock your device, such as biometrics, PIN or pattern.",
      "Google Sign-In is a feature that allows you to log in to third-party apps or websites using their Google Account credentials. It simplifies the sign-in process by eliminating the need to create and remember separate usernames and passwords for each service. You can sign in via a \"Sign in with Google\" button, a Google sign-in prompt or automatic sign-in if previously authorized.",
      "Apple Sign-In is a feature that enables you to privately sign in to participating third-party apps and websites using your Apple ID. It offers a fast, easy and more private way to authenticate without the need to create new accounts or remember additional passwords. To set up an account to \"Sign in with Apple,\" when a participating website or app asks you to set up or upgrade an account, do the following: Tap Sign in with Apple. Follow the onscreen instructions. Some apps (and websites) don\u2019t request your name and email address. In this case, you simply authenticate with Face ID or Touch ID (depending on your model), then start using the app.\u00a0Others may ask for your name and email address to set up a personalized account. When an app asks for this information, Sign in with Apple displays your name and the personal email address from your Apple Account for you to review.",
      "These methods rely on cryptographic keys or secure tokens, making it much harder for attackers to intercept your login information, even if they manage to trick you into visiting a malicious site.",
      "FBI WARNS OF DANGEROUS NEW \u2018SMISHING\u2019 SCAM TARGETING YOUR PHONE",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "Astaroth shows just how far phishing kits have come, taking things beyond the usual tricks and bypassing 2FA with ease. It\u2019s a reminder that no matter how secure we think our systems are, there\u2019s always a smarter attack waiting to exploit the gaps. Cybercriminals are adapting fast, and while traditional defenses may not cut it anymore, there are still steps you can take to fight back: use passwordless logins, stay updated and keep learning about these evolving threats.",

Those with substantial retirement savings or investments naturally represent more valuable targets \u2014 the more assets you have, the more attention you'll attract from criminals looking for bigger payoffs. Many older adults are particularly vulnerable as they didn't grow up with today's technology and may be less familiar with AI's capabilities. This knowledge gap makes it harder to recognize when AI is being used maliciously. Compounding this risk is an extensive digital footprint: if you're active on social media or have a significant online presence, you're inadvertently providing fraudsters with the raw materials they need to create convincing deepfakes and highly personalized scams designed specifically to exploit your trust.",

      "FBI WARNS OF DANGEROUS NEW \u2018SMASHING' SCAM TARGETING YOUR PHONE",
      "How to protect yourself in the age of AI",
      "Protection against AI-powered threats requires a multi-layered approach that goes well beyond just digital measures. Awareness is your first line of defense \u2014 understanding how these scams work helps you spot red flags before you become a victim. This awareness should be paired with both digital safeguards and \"analog\" verification systems that exist entirely offline. Here are some key steps to protect yourself:",
      "1.\u00a0Invest in personal data removal services: Generative AI fundamentally needs your personal data to craft convincing scams, which is why limiting your online footprint has become paramount in today's fraud landscape. The less information about you that's publicly available, the fewer raw materials scammers have to work with. Going completely off-grid is unrealistic for most of us today \u2014 much like never leaving your home. But you can reduce your online footprint substantially with a personal data removal service like Incogni, making yourself significantly less exposed to AI-powered scams.",
      "By removing your personal data from data broker companies, you not only protect yourself from GenAI-powered fraud but also gain numerous other privacy benefits, such as reduced risks of receiving spam and falling victim to identity theft, as well as helping to prevent stalking and harassment. As AI technology advances, gen-AI scams will only become more sophisticated. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "2. Establish your own verification protocols:\u00a0Consider agreeing on a \"safe word\" that only family members know. If you receive an unexpected call from a relative in distress, ask for this word before taking action.",
      "3. Choose strong, unique passwords for each account: Create complex passwords using a combination of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. Avoid using easily guessable information like birthdays or common words. Consider using a\u00a0password manager to generate and store complex passwords. A password manager can generate and store strong, unique passwords for all your accounts, reducing the risk of password reuse and making it easier to maintain good password hygiene. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed Password Managers of 2025 here.",
      "4. Enable two-factor authentication (2FA) on all accounts: 2FA adds an extra layer of security by requiring a second form of verification, such as a code sent to your phone, in addition to your password.",
      "5. Receive MFA codes via an authenticator app on your phone rather than email when possible: Using an\u00a0authenticator app like Microsoft Authenticator or Google Authenticator is more secure than receiving codes via email. Authenticator apps generate time-based one-time passcodes (TOTPs) that are not transmitted over email or SMS, reducing the risk of interception by hackers. Additionally, authenticator apps often support biometric authentication and push notifications, making the verification process both secure and convenient.",
      "6. Use a strong antivirus software: Modern cybersecurity threats are evolving rapidly, with AI being used to create more convincing phishing attacks, deepfake scams, and malware. Investing in strong antivirus software can help identify and block suspicious activity before it reaches you. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "7. Trust your intuition and verify: If something feels \"off,\" like you notice unusual phrasing or strange background noises, trust your instincts. Don't let fraudsters create a false sense of urgency. If you receive a communication claiming to be from a financial institution, call that institution directly using the official number from its website.",
      "8. Monitor your accounts: Review account statements regularly for suspicious transactions. Don\u2019t hesitate to request a credit freeze if you suspect your data has been compromised.",

Clicking the \"I\u2019m not a robot\" button triggers a set of instructions asking you to press specific keyboard shortcuts. First, you are told to press Windows + R, which opens the Windows Run dialog. Then you are instructed to press CTRL + V, which pastes a malicious script copied from the website\u2019s virtual clipboard. If you press enter, a script is executed that downloads and runs malware.",

      "2. Don\u2019t click links from unverified emails and use strong antivirus software:\u00a0Many ClickFix attacks start with phishing emails that impersonate trusted services like Booking.com or Google Meet. Always verify the sender before clicking on links. If an email seems urgent or unexpected, go directly to the company\u2019s official website instead of clicking any links inside the email.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",

      "3. Enable two-factor authentication:\u00a0Enable two-factor authentication whenever possible. This adds an extra layer of security by requiring a second form of verification, such as a code sent to your phone, in addition to your password.",
      "4. Keep devices updated: Regularly\u00a0updating your operating system, browser and security software ensures you have the latest patches against known vulnerabilities. Cybercriminals exploit outdated systems, so enabling automatic updates is a simple but effective way to stay protected.",
      "5. Monitor your accounts for suspicious activity and change your passwords:\u00a0If you\u2019ve interacted with a suspicious website, phishing email or fake login page, check your online accounts for any unusual activity. Look for unexpected login attempts, unauthorized password resets or financial transactions that you don\u2019t recognize. If anything seems off, change your passwords immediately and report the activity to the relevant service provider. Also, consider using a\u00a0password manager to generate and store complex passwords. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 here.",
      "6. Invest in personal data removal service: Consider using a service that monitors your personal information and alerts you to potential breaches or unauthorized use of your data. These services can provide early warning signs of identity theft or other malicious activities resulting from ClickFix or similar attacks. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",

      "ClickFix is a reminder that malware doesn\u2019t always rely on complex exploits. It often just needs you to follow the wrong instructions. Attackers are refining their methods, making scams like fake CAPTCHAs, phishing emails and deceptive pop-ups more convincing than ever. The best way to stay ahead is to question anything that seems even slightly off. If a website asks you to run commands or paste something into PowerShell, it\u2019s a red flag.

      "In addition, Iran could again turn to its close ties to terrorist networks to transfer missile capabilities to war-torn areas like Yemen, which could enable it to strike further south into the Indian Ocean by some 800 miles.",

      "The report describes the assault as \"a meticulously planned operation designed not only to kill but to terrorize through extreme brutality, looting and humiliation.\" It includes testimonies of group rapes of women and girls, some of whom were murdered, as well as evidence of sexual violence committed against corpses.

      "\u201cUltimately, I believe the program will crumble from within without the federal office there to manage it,\u201d said Andrew Germain, who was director of fiscal operations and accountability for the Administration for Children and Families, the HHS division that leads dozens of programs from welfare assistance to child-abuse prevention.",
      "Germain and his team were responsible for conducting oversight and providing technical assistance to such community services, including LIHEAP. He received an email from HHS around 5 a.m. ET Tuesday informing him that he would be placed on administrative leave until June 2. The Office of Personnel Management requires federal employees be given 60 days\u2019 notice before the effective date of workforce cuts.",
      "A representative for HHS didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.",
      "LIHEAP is widely seen as a lifeline for millions of low-income households struggling to cover home heating and cooling costs.",
      "Consumer advocates have for years called for additional funding to account for inflation and increasingly unpredictable swings in regional temperatures, which have driven up air conditioning use in typically colder climates. Congress largely has not fulfilled those requests for more funding, limiting the extent of LIHEAP aid. Last year the program\u2019s allocation was slashed to $4.1 billion from $6.1 billion the previous year.",
      "While the majority of the latest funding grant has been issued, about $400 million has yet to be distributed, sources said.",
      "\u201cFor the communities that need the funding and need the support of the federal office, they\u2019re going to be without those resources,\u201d Germain said. \u201cYou\u2019re talking about individuals who rely on crisis assistance from the LIHEAP program to keep the power on, whether it be for a medical reason or some other potentially life-threatening purpose.\u201d",
      "Mark Wolfe, executive director of the National Energy Assistance Directors Association, which represents state LIHEAP administrators who manage the program\u2019s aid dollars, said the staff terminations Tuesday came without warning.",
      "\u201cYou have to have some infrastructure in place to run these large programs,\u201d he said. \u201cThis undermines the ability of the program to function.\u201d",
      "Last week, ahead of President Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cLiberation Day\u201d of sweeping new tariffs, NEADA projected utility bills would spike as much as 20% in some regions should levies on Canadian imports be included in the additional trade barriers.",
      "In response to the mass firings of HHS employees, Rep. Rosa DeLauro, D-Conn., ranking member on the Appropriations Committee and its Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education Subcommittee, said, \u201cAmericans will die because of these senseless and irresponsible actions.\u201d",
      "\u201cElon Musk and President Trump do not care about helping the middle class, working families, or the vulnerable,\u201d she said in a statement. \u201cThey care only about paying for tax breaks for billionaires.\u201d"

      "WASHINGTON \u2014 At least six federal agencies are offering workers a new \"deferred resignation\" opportunity in the latest attempt by the Trump administration to slash the size of the U.S. government.",
      "Employees at the Department of Housing and Urban Development and the Agriculture Department on Monday night received emails, which were obtained by NBC News, presenting them with the option to resign while staying on paid leave for several months. Transportation Department employees received a similar notice about the program Tuesday morning, according to an email obtained by\u00a0NBC News.",
      "Spokespersons for the General Services Administration and the Energy Department told NBC News that the deferred resignation program was opening up to its eligible employees as well, and the Defense Department said its civilian workforce received a similar offer Friday.",
      "The White House has said about 75,000 federal workers accepted the administration's first offer.",
      "The first deferred resignation program allowed workers to resign now but get paid through September. The new programs are similar.",
      "Not every USDA worker is eligible for the program, depending on whether their position is considered critical, according to the email USDA employees received. Certain employees at the Transportation Department are also ineligible, including public safety workers at places like the Federal Aviation Administration.",
      "The letter sent to Energy Department employees said the program was being instituted \"to mitigate the effect of potential involuntary separations\" and allow employees \"to take needed time for future planning while continuing to be paid through the designated period.\"",
      "The Housing Department program has stipulations for employees planning to retire in the fall, according to the email HUD workers received.",
      "The first \"deferred resignation\" proposal \u2014 sent weeks before government funding was set to expire \u2014 sparked confusion over whether employees who took the offer could expect payments from agencies whose budgets had not been set past mid-March.",
      "\"During the initial opt-in period for DRP, many employees expressed concerns about the validity of the program because agencies were under a temporary continuing resolution through March 14, 2025,\" read the email sent to HUD employees and obtained by NBC News, referring to government funding and the abbreviation for the deferred resignation program. \"This uncertainty may have prevented some employees from taking advantage of the program.\"",
      "\"Since passage of a full-year continuing resolution, many employees have asked if the program would be available again,\" the HUD email continued.",
      "In a memo Friday, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth directed his team to implement another deferred resignation program. A news release published Saturday said the program was being \u201creopened for nearly all DOD civilians.\u201d There were about 900,000 DOD civilian workers before the first program, according to the release.",
      "\"My intent is to maximize participation so that we can minimize the number of involuntary actions that may be required to achieve the strategic objectives,\" Hegseth said in the memo, according to the release.",
      "The deadline for workers to accept the offer is Monday for Transportation Department employees, April 8 for Agriculture Department and Energy Department employees and April 11 for HUD employees, according to the emails. The GSA spokesperson told NBC News that the agency\u2019s eligible employees can opt into the program through April 18. The Defense Department declined to provide further details on the deadline for opting into its program.",
      "While emails about the first version of the program had been sent through a system that allowed the administration to contact all federal employees at once, the new deferred resignation letters were specific to the will of each agency and not dictated by the Office of Personnel Management, according to an administration official.",
      "Emails about the first version of the program were initially sent in January but were quickly challenged in court. A federal judge in February ultimately allowed the program to move forward after temporarily halting it.",
      "Full-time federal employees across the U.S. government were eligible for the first program, with exceptions. Members of the military, U.S. Postal Service employees and workers who held positions related to immigration enforcement, national security and certain other jobs were ineligible.",
      "In a separate effort spearheaded by Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency, the Health and Human Services Department\u00a0is also carrying out massive layoffs this week.",

      "WASHINGTON \u2014 The White House's firing of a career federal prosecutor last week was one in a series of Trump administration moves that have undermined the post-Watergate separation between the White House and the Justice Department \u2014 and spread fears about political interference in ongoing criminal cases.",
      "Assistant U.S. Attorney Adam Schleifer, based in Los Angeles, was told by a White House official in an email Friday that he was being terminated. The email came from Saurabh Sharma of the White House Presidential Personnel Office, two sources told NBC News.",
      "The office handles roughly 4,000 political appointees within the executive branch, but it isn't involved in hiring career employees.",
      "Presidents appoint the 93 U.S. attorneys that serve as top federal prosecutors in jurisdictions around the country, but not the thousands of career prosecutors, known as assistant U.S. attorneys.",
      "A former longtime veteran of the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Central District of California told NBC News that Schleifer was well respected by those in supervisory positions, calling him \u201can excellent prosecutor, very hard-working, very smart\u201d who was aggressive but also adhered closely to ethical standards.",
      "\u201cThe whole thing is bizarre. It\u2019s extremely unusual for a line AUSA to be fired by the president of the United States. It\u2019s insane,\u201d the former official said.",
      "The firing of Schleifer came roughly an hour after right-wing influencer Laura Loomer resurfaced comments that Schleifer had made about Trump during an unsuccessful run for Congress in New York.",
      "\u201cFire him. He supported the impeachment of President Trump and said he wanted to repeal Trump\u2019s tax plan,\u201d Loomer wrote. \u201cWe need to purge the US Attorney\u2019s office of all leftist Trump haters.\u201d",
      "Schleifer was not a federal employee at the time of his 2020 comments, in which he called for the repeal of Trump\u2019s tax plan and said that Trump \u201cerodes our constitutional integrity every day with every lie and ever act of heedless, narcissistic corruption.\u201d Schleifer had left his career position in the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Central District of California before his race for Congress. He was rehired by the office in January 2021, when Trump was still in the White House.",
      "Not long after Loomer\u2019s post Friday, Schleifer got the email notifying him of his termination.",
      "The Trump administration has operated under a more expansive theory of presidential power within the executive branch than his predecessors, essentially holding that the power of the executive branch is fully vested in the presidency and that Trump has the power to do as he wishes with executive agencies and employees.",
      "But that follows decades of precedent, following President Richard Nixon's resignation, that the White House keeps its distance from the Justice Department to preserve the independence of federal law enforcement.",
      "Stacey Young, a former Justice Department lawyer who founded a group that supports DOJ employees called Justice Connection, was similarly alarmed by the Schleifer firing.",
      "\u201cThe White House firing career prosecutors for doing their jobs is likely unprecedented,\" Young told NBC News. \"It\u2019s also the very weaponization this administration pretends to oppose.\u201d",
      "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Central District of California declined to comment. The White House did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "The Trump administration has targeted career prosecutors before, including firing individuals who served on special counsel Jack Smith's team as well as assistant U.S. attorneys who worked on cases against Trump supporters who stormed the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. But those personnel decisions were still routed through Trump appointees within the Justice Department, including by then-Acting Deputy Attorney General Emil Bove, as opposed to being handled by a White House official.",
      "Schleifer, who was part of the U.S. Attorney's Office's Corporate and Securities Fraud Strike Force, had been working on a tax evasion case against Andy Wiederhorn, the former CEO and current chairman of Fat Brands, which owns Fatburger, Johnny Rockets and Twin Peaks. Then-U.S. Attorney Martin Estrada, announcing the indictment last year, said that Wiederhorn had \"treated the company as his personal slush fund, in violation of federal law.\"",
      "Public records show that Wiederhorn donated to Trump\u2019s campaign, the Save America PAC and the Republican National Committee during the 2024 campaign cycle. Reached by NBC News, Wiederhorn\u2019s attorney Douglas Fuchs declined to comment. A spokeswoman for Fat Brands also declined to comment.",
      "Justice Department veterans worry that the ability of the White House to directly fire career prosecutors working on cases against Trump allies would have a chilling effect on the prosecution of white-collar crime.",
      "\"Who's going to prosecute white-collar crime now?\" the former federal prosecutor at the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Central District of California official said."

    "story": [
      "The Republican candidates have prevailed in a pair of special congressional elections in Florida Tuesday, NBC News projects, giving Republicans some more breathing room as they navigate a narrow House majority.",
      "NBC News projects that Florida Chief Financial Officer Jimmy Patronis has won the race in the 1st District to replace former GOP Rep. Matt Gaetz, while Republican state Sen. Randy Fine won the 6th District race to replace former GOP Rep. Michael Waltz, who is now Trump\u2019s national security adviser.",
      "Fine was leading Democrat Josh Weil 54%-46% when the NBC News Decision Desk called the race with 73% of the expected vote in. In three counties where nearly all of the expected vote is in, Fine was faring around 10 points worse than former GOP Rep. Michael Waltz in November, who resigned from the seat to serve as Trump's national security adviser.",
      "Patronis defeated Democrat Gay Valimont, a former activist with Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America who lost to Gaetz in November.",
      "The 6th District race was giving some Republicans heartburn, with Weil vastly outraising Fine and Fine slow to launch TV ads. President Donald Trump carried the district, which includes Daytona Beach, by 30 points in November, but outside Republican groups hit the airwaves in the final days as the race appeared to be competitive.",
      "Trump himself also engaged to help turn out his supporters, as Democrats looked to leverage lower turnout in a special election and energy among the party\u2019s grassroots to oppose the president. Trump issued multiple Truth Social posts and held two tele-town halls last week for both candidates.",
      "Fine is a staunch Trump ally, having switched his endorsement in the 2024 presidential primary from home-state Gov. Ron DeSantis to Trump. Fine wrote in an op-ed that he, as a Jewish Republican, did not believe DeSantis had done enough to combat antisemitism. DeSantis represented the 6th District in Congress before running for governor.",
      "Fine\u2019s decision to endorse Trump earned him the president\u2019s support ahead of the special primary election in January, helping Fine easily win the GOP nod. And he touted his ties to Trump in the race.",
      "\u201cI stand behind you 100% and you\u2019ll have no greater warrior for your agenda than me,\u201d Fine said of Trump in last week\u2019s tele-town hall.",
      "Fine\u2019s support for Trump appealed to Linda Morgan, one Republican voter who cast her ballot Tuesday morning for Fine.",
      "\u201cIf he admits he\u2019s going to help President Trump do the job that we elected him for, then I\u2019m all in,\u201d Morgan told NBC News outside a polling place in Daytona Beach.",
      "Fine celebrated his victory by crediting Trump with the win, writing on X, \"Because of you, Mr. President. I won't let you down.\"",
      "Patronis also pitched himself as a Trump ally, though he stayed neutral in the presidential primary, telling NBC News in a January interview that he wanted to maintain a good working relationship with DeSantis.",
      "'All hands on deck'",
      "Valimont significantly outraised Patronis, which he acknowledged created \"a lot of anxiety\" in his race.",
      "But the fundraising gap was even wider in the slightly-less-Republican 6th District, which drove Republican concerns about Fine's prospects.",
      "Weil, a public school teacher who had raised more than $10 million as of March 31 according to recent fundraising reports, had leveraged his strong fundraising to launch attacks against Fine on potential GOP-led cuts to entitlement programs, including Social Security and Medicaid, in a district where nearly 30% of the population is over the age of 65.",
      "Trump attempted to counter those attacks in last week\u2019s tele-town hall, telling supporters, \u201cRandy will vote to defend Social Security, protect Medicare, cut your taxes, end inflation, fully fund our border security agenda.\u201d",
      "Fine had raised $2 million as of March 31, including $600,000 from the candidate himself, fueling some GOP concerns that the race could be closer than expected.",
      "Fine also lives more than 100 miles south of the seat he was running in and never made real inroads in the region, and he did not start running TV ads until late in the campaign.",
      "That worried Republicans, but Weil's huge financial support is what bred panic among Republicans and the White House.",
      "\u201cThe White House was late in learning what almost every Floridian involved in politics knew,\u201d said a longtime Florida operative involved with the race and familiar with the Trump orbit's thinking. Once they realized Fine's vulnerabilities, the source said, \"they engaged at an enormous level and expended the necessary resources to win it.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt was all hands on deck,\u201d the person added.",
      "That effort included a huge push from Florida Republicans to travel to the district to help get out the vote for Fine, and a late influx of cash to get Fine on TV and help blunt the money disadvantage he had against Weil.",
      "\u201cPanic and money can solve a lot of problems,\u201d said a Republican consultant working on Fine\u2019s campaign.",
      "Democrats, meanwhile, took solace in Weil appearing to perform better than former Vice President Kamala Harris.",
      "\"In 2025, Democrats have overperformed the top of the ticket in nearly every election as voters turn out in blue, purple, and red districts to voice their anger at Donald Trump and Elon Musk,\" Democratic National Committee Chairman Ken Martin said in a statement. \"Tonight was no different.\"",
      "Some breathing room",
      "The pair of GOP victories gives Republican House leaders a little more breathing room in passing their major priorities.",
      "Republicans will now have a 220-213 majority, with two Democratic vacancies, meaning they can afford to lose three Republicans and still pass legislation along party lines, assuming every sitting member votes.",
      "Patronis and Fine will head to Congress as Republicans are trying to piece together a sweeping budget proposal to tackle Trump's top priorities, including extending Trump's 2017 tax cuts.",
      "Fine has signaled that he will support Trump's agenda, telling Trump at last week's tele-town hall that his race could determine \u201cwhether you have the votes in Congress you need to get the job done.\u201d",
      "Patronis said in an interview with NBC News last week that his top priorities in Congress would be on the economy and supporting veterans. (The 1st District has the second-highest share of veterans of any district in the country, according to the Veterans Administration.)",
      "Asked if there were any elements of a possible budget proposal that he would not support, such as cuts to Medicaid, Patronis demurred, saying he had not given much thought to \u201cthose type of hypotheticals.\u201d",
      "\u201cMy principles are making sure that we\u2019re either restoring dollars back to the citizens of CD-1, we spend their dollars more efficient,\u201d Patronis said. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s good to create a path where you\u2019re taking away something from a benefit or entitlement that somebody is counting on. I do like giving people options."

      "WASHINGTON \u2014 A band of Republican lawmakers sank an effort Tuesday by Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., to kill a plan to allow remote voting for lawmakers who become new parents, a bitter dispute that brought the House floor to a halt.",
      "A procedural rule vote to advance the House GOP\u2019s package of bills for the week failed 206-222, with nine Republicans bucking Johnson and voting with all 213 Democrats. The failed vote means that, for now, those pieces of legislation cannot move forward for final votes.",
      "\"Today is a pretty historical day for the entire conference,\" said Rep. Anna Paulina Luna, R-Fla., who has led the proxy-voting push and clashed with Johnson over the issue.",
      "\"It's showing that the body has decided that parents deserve a voice in Washington,\" she said, \"and also to the importance of female members having a vote in Washington, D.C.\"",
      "Shortly after the vote, congressional leaders said they were sending lawmakers home for the week and would bring them back Monday.",
      "\"Let me just make clear, that rule being brought down means that we can't have further action on the floor this week,\" Johnson told reporters as he left the chamber.",
      "Luna, who gave birth to her first child in 2023, had planned to force a floor vote this week on a resolution that would allow new mothers and fathers in the House to be able to vote remotely, through proxies, for up to 12 weeks.",
      "But the effort has been fiercely opposed by Johnson and his leadership team, as well as members of the far-right House Freedom Caucus, of which Luna had been a member until recently. Opponents called the proposal \u201cunconstitutional\u201d and warned it would lead to a slippery slope where others would request to vote by proxy.",
      "To stop Luna, Johnson\u2019s team inserted language in a rules package to kill the proxy-voting push by essentially blocking any discharge petition, a tool that allows any member to circumvent leadership of the majority party and bring legislation directly to the floor for a vote after having collected 218 signatures.",
      "Luna had collected the 218 signatures, including those of 11 Republicans, needed to force a vote on the proxy resolution. Rep. Brittany Pettersen, D-Colo., who gave birth in January and brought her baby to the floor Tuesday, was the lead author of the bill and has been working closely with Luna.",
      "\"Speaker Johnson pulled out all the stops, and people continue to stand with us,\" Pettersen said after the vote, holding her baby and standing next to Luna. \"We're changing the way that Congress works, making sure that moms and parents have a voice, and I'm just so proud to be a part of this.",
      "Asked what her message to the speaker is, Pettersen replied: \"We said, 'Don't f--- with moms.'\"",
      "Shortly before the rule vote Tuesday, Luna took to the floor and officially made a motion to formalize the discharge petition, which would bring the proposal to the floor within two legislative days. But because leadership adjourned the House until Monday, the vote won't be held until at least next week.",
      "In addition to Luna, the other Republicans who voted down the rule are: Nick LaLota and Mike Lawler, both of New York; Tim Burchett, of Tennessee; Greg Steube, of Florida; Jeff Van Drew, of New Jersey; Kevin Kiley, of California; Max Miller, of Ohio; and Ryan Mackenzie, of Pennsylvania.",
      "\"It's the right thing to do,\" Burchett told NBC News.",
      "The remote vote issue has deeply divided the GOP conference when the White House and Republicans are trying to press forward on their sweeping legislative agenda.",
      "The fight can be traced to the Covid-19 pandemic, when then-Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., allowed proxy voting in the name of public safety. But Republicans railed against the move at the time, arguing that lawmakers' chief responsibility is to show up and vote.",
      "Proponents of proxy voting for new parents said it is needed to attract young people, including those with children, to run for public office.",
      "\"Congress would look a lot different if we had more moms here in Congress,\" Pettersen said. \"We're working to address the barriers that we face to serving.\""

      "Steep federal funding cuts have forced public health officials in one of Texas\u2019 most populous counties \u2014 Dallas \u2014 to cancel dozens of vaccination clinics and lay off 21 workers on the front lines of combatting the state\u2019s growing measles outbreak.",
      "\u201cI just had to tell our commissioners this morning that we\u2019ve had to cancel over 50 different clinics in our community,\u201d said Dr. Philip Huang, director and health authority for the Dallas County Health and Human Services Department. Many of the clinics had been planned for schools in areas with low vaccination rates, he said.",
      "The vaccines, which included measles, mumps and rubella shots, were meant to be given free to families.",
      "The money being cut \u2014 $11.4 billion nationwide \u2014 was originally allocated to aid community health departments during the pandemic. Local public health officials have more recently been using the Covid funds for other public health initiatives, such as measles prevention, surveillance and testing.",
      "Last week however, the Department of Health and Human Services announced that it would \u201cno longer waste billions of taxpayer dollars responding to a non-existent pandemic that Americans moved on from years ago.\u201d",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s very short-sighted and not understanding of the way public health works,\u201d Huang said. \u201cBeing prepared for Covid helps build our capacity to be able to respond to other issues.\u201d",
      "Huang said his team was still assessing the exact amount of money slashed in his budget, but estimated it to be in the millions.",
      "As of Tuesday, 422 measles had been reported by the Texas Department of State Health Services. None are in Dallas County, but Huang said the cuts would leave his community vulnerable to cases.",
      "Eleven full-time and 10 part-time staffers were let go, he said. The majority were health care providers giving vaccines, epidemiologists and lab staff involved with measles surveillance and prevention.",
      "Staff operating vaccine clinics in West Texas, which remains the epicenter of the measles outbreak, said those clinics are continuing as planned for now.",
      "Other states reporting measles outbreaks include Kansas with 23 cases, Oklahoma with 10 cases, and New Mexico with 48 cases. And public health officials in Ohio have identified at least a dozen cases."

    "story": [
      "NEILY, Costa Rica \u2014 After being deported from the U.S. with his wife and 6-year-old son, German Smirnov, a Russian national, is being held at a migrant camp in the Central American country. After more than a month there, he says he feels he is being forced to consider staying there to live.",
      "Smirnov, 36, is among 110 migrants, mostly from Asian and African countries, who have been detained at the Center for Temporary Attention of Migrants (CATEM) since late February and now find themselves in limbo.",
      "Many of the detainees tell Noticias Telemundo they\u2019re confused and torn over the limited options being offered by Costa Rican officials, including applying for asylum there, going back to their home countries, waiting it out in the shelter or officially documenting their case to request asylum in another country. It\u2019s all while enduring high temperatures and poor food and conditions.",
      "But many of the migrants say they don\u2019t have a safe country to return to and little information to help them.",
      "For the first time since the migrants arrived from the U.S., and following weeks of pressure from activists and lawmakers, Costa Rican authorities have opened up the camp to the media. Several migrants who have had their documents confiscated said that they feel they have few choices about what comes next.",
      "\u201cThey tell us nothing here,\u201d Smirnov said. \u201cWe\u2019re here for almost 40 days.\u201d",
      "Smirnov, who had planned on requesting asylum in America before the Trump administration suspended asylum at the Southern border, said it\u2019s impossible to return to Russia after fleeing for political reasons.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s complicated. I\u2019m ready to stay here, but I don\u2019t have anywhere to live,\u201d Smirnov said. \u201cI don\u2019t have a job and I don\u2019t speak the local language.\u201d",
      "Costa Rica is one of several Central American countries that has agreed to serve as a bridge between the U.S. and the migrants, many of whom come from countries like China or India.",
      "So far, six people have fled the camp without authorization or documents, said Omer Badilla, Costa Rica\u2019s deputy minister of the interior and police. Dozens more have been repatriated to their home countries, while the majority remain at the center behind a chain-link fence, forbidden to leave the premises.",
      "Until the migrants make an official choice, passports and other identification documents will remain confiscated, Badilla said. As of Monday, the country had not received a formal asylum request from any of the migrants, Badilla said.",
      "Badilla said that the migrants have all been made aware of their options, particularly about the need to formalize their asylum claims with documents in other countries. But he said that many do not want to speak with authorities.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019ve been told to document the case, and they\u2019re afraid. We only work on documented cases. They\u2019re afraid to talk to the police,\u201d Badilla said. \u201cWe\u2019re working so they can feel confident that we won\u2019t take action against them.\u201d",
      "But Badilla said that the country is guaranteeing that those who feel a \u201cwell-founded fear\u201d of returning to their countries of origin will not be forced to do so.",
      "Smirnov said that, if he returns to Russia, he could be forced to join in Moscow\u2019s war against Ukraine.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019ll put me in jail or send me to war,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s simple, because my country is at war with a neighboring country.\u201d",
      "A St. Petersburg native, Smirnov was\u00a0an elections official who was recruited by the Anti-Corruption Foundation, an organization founded by the late opposition leader Alexei Navalny, to expose fraud in last year\u2019s election. Authorities discovered his agreement with the group, he said, and he was forced to flee Russia.",
      "\u201cThey caught me while I was recording the whole process,\u201d Smirnov said. \u201cMaybe someone betrayed me, I don\u2019t know.\u201d",
      "Smirnov, who was detained for nearly a month in San Diego before being deported to Costa Rica, said his family had hoped to relocate to Australia or Canada. But he said that their requests for help in relocating to a third country have been ignored by authorities.",
      "Mohammad Saber Asadi, who fled Afghanistan with his wife, Najia, and their almost 3-year-old daughter, Asra, said he\u2019s been searching for a path to another country, like Canada or Germany. But without visas in place, he said that authorities have given him only two options: stay in Costa Rica or go back to Afghanistan.",
      "Asadi, who runs a construction company, fled Afghanistan after he was threatened by the Taliban for selling materials to contractors from the United States or other Western countries. Asadi said that he had already been arrested after the Taliban returned to power in 2021, and can\u2019t risk another stint in prison.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know what will happen to me,\u201d Asadi said.",
      "Attempting to start a life in Costa Rica isn\u2019t so simple.",
      "\u201cI would like to go to a country that I can live, that I can make a good future for my family, for my daughter,\u201d Asadi said. \u201cBut here in Costa Rica, I think it\u2019s not possible for me. I don\u2019t know Spanish, I don\u2019t have information about the culture of Costa Rica and I don\u2019t have any family here to support me.\u201d",
      "The conditions at the camp haven\u2019t made their time in detention any easier, either, the migrants said. Alexandra, a Russian migrant who requested to go by her first name out of fear of retaliation from the Russian government, said many in the camp are nervous, stressed and lost. There\u2019s little ventilation amid the over-90-degree weather, and many have fallen ill.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t have air conditioning or fans, some families have sick children, and some women have fainted,\u201d she said.",
      "Asadi also said that while food had been provided by a local restaurant, paid for by the U.S., those meals have since been halted. Migrants have been living on beans and rice on most days, which is particularly difficult for infants, since it\u2019s\u00a0 been challenging to access any baby food. And little drinking water is provided throughout the day.",
      "\u201cWe are not free to go outside of here. Here, it\u2019s like a jail,\u201d Asadi said. \u201cThe children, they cry every day. They cry.\u201d",
      "Costa Rica\u2019s role in U.S. deportations has drawn criticisms for the past few weeks, with immigrant rights advocates saying that the country is complicit in America\u2019s human rights violations. Badilla has said that Costa Rica agreed to accept the migrants \u201cbecause of our history and our customs as human rights protectors,\u201d and that the agreement with the Trump administration isn\u2019t based on any special conditions.",
      "\u201cWe responded to the United States\u2019 government\u2019s request, and we raised our hand to help them,\u201d Badilla said.",
      "Costa Rican President Rodrigo Chaves said at a news conference in February that the country is helping its \u201ceconomically powerful brother from the north.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf they impose a tax in our free zones, it\u2019ll screw us,\u201d Chaves said. \u201cI don\u2019t think they\u2019ll do it, thank God ... Love is repaid with love. ... Two-hundred will come, we treat them well and they will leave.\u201d"

    "summary": "Mahmoud Khalil, who was studying at Columbia, and Alireza Doroudi, from the University of Alabama, are both being held at an ICE processing center in Jena, Louisiana.",
    "story": [
      "At least three students recently detained by the Trump administration and put in deportation proceedings have been taken to highly remote detention centers in rural Louisiana that human rights groups have called \u201ca black hole.\u201d",
      "Students Mahmoud Khalil, Rumeysa Ozturk and Alireza Doroudi were arrested near their homes, then taken hundreds of miles away to desolate, rural detention centers in a state that, since President Donald Trump's first administration, has become an increasingly critical part of the country\u2019s immigrant detention apparatus.",
      "The federal government has broad authority to transfer immigrants facing deportation to different facilities. But advocates and experts said that there have been major human rights abuses in facilities in this region and that the Trump administration has sent the students to a very conservative jurisdiction that is highly favorable to its immigration policy goals.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re being placed in facilities that have pretty horrendous conditions, a lot of difficulties with access to counsel and in what is really a more hostile legal jurisdiction to fight their case for the right to remain in the United States,\u201d said Mary Yanik, the director of the Immigrant Rights Clinic at Tulane Law School in New Orleans. Yanik is also an associate law professor at the university.",
      "The Department of Homeland Security did not comment on its decision to detain the students in Louisiana, allegations against facilities in the state or the role the facilities play in the administration\u2019s immigration agenda. The White House did not respond to a request for comment. In court documents related to the arrest of Khalil, the administration said overcrowded facilities and bedbugs in the Northeast led to its decision to send him to Louisiana.",
      "Khalil, a legal permanent resident and pro-Palestinian protest leader at Columbia University, was arrested at his apartment building in New York City on March 8, before being shuttled to a detention center in New Jersey and then taken some 1,000 miles away to the Central Louisiana ICE Processing Center in Jena, Louisiana.",
      "Khalil\u2019s lawyers are fighting to have him returned to the Northeast and released in a case challenging his arrest and detention that was recently moved to a New Jersey court. Meanwhile, his separate deportation proceedings have begun playing out in front of an immigration judge in Louisiana.",
      "Last week, Alireza Doroudi, a doctoral student from Iran who was studying at the University of Alabama, was arrested off campus by federal immigration authorities with little known about his case. Immigration and Customs Enforcement\u2019s detainee locator has since revealed Doroudi was also taken to the Central Louisiana ICE Processing Center in Jena.",
      "The same day, Tufts University doctoral student Rumeysa Ozturk, a Turkish national who was in the United States with a valid student visa, was pulled off the street on her way to break her Ramadan fast with friends in an arrest by plainclothes agents captured on video.",
      "She was taken to the South Louisiana ICE Processing Center in Basile, Louisiana, which holds female detainees.",
      "Ozturk was transferred to Louisiana without the administration notifying her legal team, her lawyers said in court documents. The documents said that her location was withheld for nearly 24 hours. Her lawyers said moving Ozturk to Louisiana was consistent with \u201cICE\u2019s pattern and practice of moving people detained for their speech to distant locations incommunicado and in secret.\u201d",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio said last week\u00a0that the State Department has revoked 300 or more student visas, as the White House increasingly targets foreign-born students whose main transgression seems to be activism. The administration has accused some of the students of engaging in activities and activism supporting Hamas, which the students and their attorneys deny.",
      "Some considerations the federal government takes when placing immigrants in detention are how long someone might be in detention, the current availability of beds as well as a person\u2019s nationality, said Kathleen Bush-Joseph, a policy analyst with the U.S. Immigration Policy Program at the Migration Policy Institute, a nonpartisan think tank.",
      "\u201cDeportation proceedings for people who are detained move much faster than those who are released, because the immigration courts prioritize those cases,\u201d she said.",
      "Louisiana became a hub for holding thousands of immigrants in ICE custody during Trump\u2019s first term, as the administration expanded the detention of migrants and asylum-seekers.",
      "\u201cLouisiana has detained more immigrants than any other state, save Texas,\u201d Yanik said.",
      "There are currently more than 7,000 immigrants detained by ICE in Louisiana, according to the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse based at Syracuse University. There are nearly 48,000 people in ICE custody nationwide, the highest number since 2019.",
      "Reports of human rights abuses",
      "NBC News has previously reported on allegations of human rights abuses in Louisiana detention facilities. In 2024, a report by the Department of Homeland Security documented problems at the Basile facility including a mosquito infestation and a lack of sufficient medical staff.",
      "In an August 2024 report titled \u201cInside the Black Hole,\u201d multiple groups said they documented \u201csystemic human rights abuses\u201d against immigrants in the facilities, which included the detention centers in Jena and Basile where the students have been taken.",
      "\u201cThere was deprivation of human necessities, abusive and discriminatory treatment. There was medical abuse and neglect,\u201d said Sarah Gillman, a co-author of the report and the director of Strategic U.S. Litigation at the nonprofit Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights.",
      "The report and others have documented for years that detainees also are exposed to unsanitary conditions, including yellow, undrinkable water; moldy food; insect infestations; and inadequate access to basic hygiene supplies.",
      "Gillman said the rights groups also found that in past cases, immigrants detained in Louisiana lacked access to lawyers and faced other major obstacles such as a lack of translators and having to prepare important documents in their deportation cases in English, a language some of them didn't speak.",
      "\u201cWe met many, many, many people who didn\u2019t have access to lawyers who could help them, didn\u2019t have access to their families, didn\u2019t have access, really, to the outside world,\u201d she said.",
      "GEO Group, which runs the facilities where the students are detained, did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the allegations in the report.",
      "ICE did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the report and allegations of human rights abuses in its Louisiana facilities. But it previously told NBC News during the Biden administration that it \u201ctakes its commitment to promoting safe, secure, humane environments for those in its custody very seriously \u2014 the agency provides comprehensive policy and strict oversight for the administrative custody of one of the most transient, diverse populations of any correctional or detention system in the world and holds firm to continuous review of the many factors relevant to the continued operation of each of its facilities.\u201d",
      "The students detained in Louisiana are in deportation proceedings before an immigration judge, in a court system that is separate from the criminal justice system. A concern of immigration attorneys and advocates is that any appeal in the students\u2019 cases would fall under the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which is among the most conservative jurisdictions in the country.",
      "The jurisdiction where an immigrant is detained has \u201cvery different precedents which can really affect the outcomes of immigrants\u2019 cases and requests for everything from release from detention to the grant of asylum or other immigration benefits,\u201d Bush-Joseph said."

      "The judge presiding over a lawsuit in New Jersey challenging the detention of Mahmoud Khalil denied the government\u2019s motion to dismiss his petition and said he has jurisdiction over the case, according to an order filed Tuesday.",
      "Federal officials had argued that Judge Michael Fabiarz, an appointee of former President Joe Biden's, did not have jurisdiction over the suit, known as a habeas petition, and moved to have it dismissed.",
      "Fabiarz said he has jurisdiction over the matter because Khalil, a permanent U.S. resident and prominent pro-Palestinian activist who is facing a deportation order due to his activism at Columbia University, was in New Jersey when the petition was filed on his behalf in New York.",
      "The petition claims that Khalil\u2019s detention violates his due process and First Amendment rights.",
      "\u201cThe Petitioner was in custody in New Jersey as of March 9 at 4:40am,\u201d Fabiarz\u2019s order states. \u201cAnd under a federal statute, the Petition, though filed in New York, must be treated as having been filed in New Jersey on March 9 at 4:40am. Therefore, this Court has jurisdiction.\u201d",
      "A Justice Department spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment Tuesday.",
      "Khalil\u2019s attorneys celebrated the decision, saying in a statement Tuesday that it \u201csends a strong message to other courts around the country facing government attempts to shop for favorable jurisdictions by moving people detained on unconstitutional immigration charges around and making it difficult or impossible for their lawyers to know where to seek their immediate release.\u201d",
      "During a hearing last week, August Flentje, acting director of the Justice Department\u2019s civil division, said Khalil was only in New Jersey for a few hours and the \u201csafest way to go about this\u201d was to move the case to Louisiana.",
      "Khalil has been held at a Louisiana detention center since shortly after his March 8 arrest, when immigration authorities took him into custody over allegations that he led activities \u201caligned to Hamas,\u201d which the United States has designated a terrorist organization.",
      "Khalil has not been charged with committing any crime, and an attorney of his has said there is no evidence he has provided any kind of support to a terrorist organization.",
      "Administration officials cited a rarely used provision in immigration law that says the Secretary of State has the authority to deport someone if the person is determined to have \"serious adverse foreign policy consequences for the United States.\u201d",
      "Attorneys for the Justice Department later claimed that Khalil, a native of Syria and citizen of Algeria who entered the U.S. on a student visa in December 2022\u00a0and became a lawful permanent resident two years later, did not disclose that he was part of Columbia University Apartheid Divest or a political officer for the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees.",
      "In a filing, the department described the alleged misrepresentations as additional grounds for Khalil's deportation.",
      "Baher Azmy, an attorney for Khalil, described the allegations as \"silly\" and said they \"primarily show that the government must know the supposed \u2018foreign policy\u2019 grounds for Mahmoud\u2019s removal are absurd and unconstitutional.\u201d",
      "The new claims \u201ccannot change the obvious fact the government has admitted \u2014 he is being punished in the most autocratic way for his constitutionally protected speech,\u201d Azmy said.",
      "A federal judge in New York who initially reviewed Khalil's petition before it was moved to New Jersey said it raises \"serious\" allegations that warrant careful review and barred Khalil's deportation while the proceedings are ongoing."

      "\u201cIt was perfect,\u201d mom Portia Moore said.",

      "The Republican candidates have prevailed in a pair of special congressional elections in Florida Tuesday, NBC News projects, giving Republicans some more breathing room as they navigate a narrow House majority.",
      "NBC News projects that Florida Chief Financial Officer Jimmy Patronis has won the race in the 1st District to replace former GOP Rep. Matt Gaetz, while Republican state Sen. Randy Fine won the 6th District race to replace former GOP Rep. Michael Waltz, who is now Trump\u2019s national security adviser.",
      "Fine was leading Democrat Josh Weil 54%-46% when the NBC News Decision Desk called the race with 73% of the expected vote in. In three counties where nearly all of the expected vote is in, Fine was faring around 10 points worse than former GOP Rep. Michael Waltz in November, who resigned from the seat to serve as Trump's national security adviser.",
      "Patronis defeated Democrat Gay Valimont, a former activist with Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America who lost to Gaetz in November.",
      "The 6th District race was giving some Republicans heartburn, with Weil vastly outraising Fine and Fine slow to launch TV ads. President Donald Trump carried the district, which includes Daytona Beach, by 30 points in November, but outside Republican groups hit the airwaves in the final days as the race appeared to be competitive.",
      "Trump himself also engaged to help turn out his supporters, as Democrats looked to leverage lower turnout in a special election and energy among the party\u2019s grassroots to oppose the president. Trump issued multiple Truth Social posts and held two tele-town halls last week for both candidates.",
      "Fine is a staunch Trump ally, having switched his endorsement in the 2024 presidential primary from home-state Gov. Ron DeSantis to Trump. Fine wrote in an op-ed that he, as a Jewish Republican, did not believe DeSantis had done enough to combat antisemitism. DeSantis represented the 6th District in Congress before running for governor.",
      "Fine\u2019s decision to endorse Trump earned him the president\u2019s support ahead of the special primary election in January, helping Fine easily win the GOP nod. And he touted his ties to Trump in the race.",
      "\u201cI stand behind you 100% and you\u2019ll have no greater warrior for your agenda than me,\u201d Fine said of Trump in last week\u2019s tele-town hall.",
      "Fine\u2019s support for Trump appealed to Linda Morgan, one Republican voter who cast her ballot Tuesday morning for Fine.",
      "\u201cIf he admits he\u2019s going to help President Trump do the job that we elected him for, then I\u2019m all in,\u201d Morgan told NBC News outside a polling place in Daytona Beach.",
      "Fine celebrated his victory by crediting Trump with the win, writing on X, \"Because of you, Mr. President. I won't let you down.\"",
      "Patronis also pitched himself as a Trump ally, though he stayed neutral in the presidential primary, telling NBC News in a January interview that he wanted to maintain a good working relationship with DeSantis.",
      "'All hands on deck'",
      "Valimont significantly outraised Patronis, which he acknowledged created \"a lot of anxiety\" in his race.",
      "But the fundraising gap was even wider in the slightly-less-Republican 6th District, which drove Republican concerns about Fine's prospects.",
      "Weil, a public school teacher who had raised more than $10 million as of March 31 according to recent fundraising reports, had leveraged his strong fundraising to launch attacks against Fine on potential GOP-led cuts to entitlement programs, including Social Security and Medicaid, in a district where nearly 30% of the population is over the age of 65.",
      "Trump attempted to counter those attacks in last week\u2019s tele-town hall, telling supporters, \u201cRandy will vote to defend Social Security, protect Medicare, cut your taxes, end inflation, fully fund our border security agenda.\u201d",
      "Fine had raised $2 million as of March 31, including $600,000 from the candidate himself, fueling some GOP concerns that the race could be closer than expected.",
      "Fine also lives more than 100 miles south of the seat he was running in and never made real inroads in the region, and he did not start running TV ads until late in the campaign.",
      "That worried Republicans, but Weil's huge financial support is what bred panic among Republicans and the White House.",
      "\u201cThe White House was late in learning what almost every Floridian involved in politics knew,\u201d said a longtime Florida operative involved with the race and familiar with the Trump orbit's thinking. Once they realized Fine's vulnerabilities, the source said, \"they engaged at an enormous level and expended the necessary resources to win it.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt was all hands on deck,\u201d the person added.",
      "That effort included a huge push from Florida Republicans to travel to the district to help get out the vote for Fine, and a late influx of cash to get Fine on TV and help blunt the money disadvantage he had against Weil.",
      "\u201cPanic and money can solve a lot of problems,\u201d said a Republican consultant working on Fine\u2019s campaign.",
      "Democrats, meanwhile, took solace in Weil appearing to perform better than former Vice President Kamala Harris.",
      "\"In 2025, Democrats have overperformed the top of the ticket in nearly every election as voters turn out in blue, purple, and red districts to voice their anger at Donald Trump and Elon Musk,\" Democratic National Committee Chairman Ken Martin said in a statement. \"Tonight was no different.\"",
      "Some breathing room",
      "The pair of GOP victories gives Republican House leaders a little more breathing room in passing their major priorities.",
      "Republicans will now have a 220-213 majority, with two Democratic vacancies, meaning they can afford to lose three Republicans and still pass legislation along party lines, assuming every sitting member votes.",
      "Patronis and Fine will head to Congress as Republicans are trying to piece together a sweeping budget proposal to tackle Trump's top priorities, including extending Trump's 2017 tax cuts.",
      "Fine has signaled that he will support Trump's agenda, telling Trump at last week's tele-town hall that his race could determine \u201cwhether you have the votes in Congress you need to get the job done.\u201d",
      "Patronis said in an interview with NBC News last week that his top priorities in Congress would be on the economy and supporting veterans. (The 1st District has the second-highest share of veterans of any district in the country, according to the Veterans Administration.)",
      "Asked if there were any elements of a possible budget proposal that he would not support, such as cuts to Medicaid, Patronis demurred, saying he had not given much thought to \u201cthose type of hypotheticals.\u201d",
      "\u201cMy principles are making sure that we\u2019re either restoring dollars back to the citizens of CD-1, we spend their dollars more efficient,\u201d Patronis said. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s good to create a path where you\u2019re taking away something from a benefit or entitlement that somebody is counting on. I do like giving people options."

      "Reyes included documents showing a scorecard immigration officials used to determine whether Hern\u00e1ndez Romero belonged to a \"security threat group\" or a gang. Hern\u00e1ndez Romero, who has \"Mom\" and \"Dad\" tattoos with crowns on his wrists, was labeled as a suspected member of Tren de Aragua based on his inkings even though he explicitly told officials he \"is not a member of any gang,\" the document shows. Another DHS document showed Hern\u00e1ndez Romero had no known criminal record when he was deported.",
      "According to Reyes' declaration, immigration officials also pointed to photos on social media showing her client posing with a beauty pageant crown to argue he was displaying gang symbols.",
      "Law enforcement and\u00a0immigration officials\u00a0across the country have\u00a0linked several tattoos and symbols to Tren de Aragua. They include crowns, stars on shoulders, firearms, grenades, trains, dice, predatory felines, gas masks,\u00a0clocks, the Illuminati sign\u00a0and the jersey number 23 \u2014 which basketball players including Michael Jordan and LeBron James made famous \u2014 in addition to tattoos of roses and Nike's Jumpman logo.",
      "Other\u00a0tattooed phrases\u00a0law enforcement says are associated with the gang include \u201cHijos de Dios\u201d (Sons of God), or its abbreviation, \u201cHJ,\u201d and \u201cReal Hasta la Muerte\u201d (Real Until Death).",
      "Gang experts have said the Venezuelan Tren de Aragua gang, unlike other Latin American gangs, such as the Salvadoran group MS-13, is not known for using tattoos to identify its members.",
      "Declarations filed in the case by Linette Tobin, an attorney representing professional soccer player Jerce Reyes Barrios as well as by the mother of barber Luis Carlos Jose Marcano Silva both state they believe the men were falsely labeled as Tren de Aragua.",
      "In her declaration, Tobin said that Reyes Barrios has \"never been arrested or charged with a crime\" and that he was accused of being a member of Tren de Aragua based on his tattoos and a photo on social media. Reyes Barrios' tattoos show a crown from the Real Madrid soccer team logo, as well as a rosary with the word \"Dios\" (God). The social media photo shows Reyes Barrios doing a \"Rock&Roll\"-style hand gesture similar to that of \"I love you\" in American Sign Language.",
      "Marcano Silva's mother, who in her declaration is identified only as A.V.S.O., said her son \"was falsely and unfoundedly accused of being a member of TdA\" during a routine ICE check-in in February and detained. \"My son is not and has never been affiliated with any gang,\" she said."

    "published": "Tue, 01 Apr 2025 22:05:56 GMT",
    "summary": "Mahmoud Khalil, who was studying at Columbia, and Alireza Doroudi, from the University of Alabama, are both being held at an ICE processing center in Jena, Louisiana.",
    "story": [
      "At least three students recently detained by the Trump administration and put in deportation proceedings have been taken to highly remote detention centers in rural Louisiana that human rights groups have called \u201ca black hole.\u201d",
      "Students Mahmoud Khalil, Rumeysa Ozturk and Alireza Doroudi were arrested near their homes, then taken hundreds of miles away to desolate, rural detention centers in a state that, since President Donald Trump's first administration, has become an increasingly critical part of the country\u2019s immigrant detention apparatus.",
      "The federal government has broad authority to transfer immigrants facing deportation to different facilities. But advocates and experts said that there have been major human rights abuses in facilities in this region and that the Trump administration has sent the students to a very conservative jurisdiction that is highly favorable to its immigration policy goals.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re being placed in facilities that have pretty horrendous conditions, a lot of difficulties with access to counsel and in what is really a more hostile legal jurisdiction to fight their case for the right to remain in the United States,\u201d said Mary Yanik, the director of the Immigrant Rights Clinic at Tulane Law School in New Orleans. Yanik is also an associate law professor at the university.",
      "The Department of Homeland Security did not comment on its decision to detain the students in Louisiana, allegations against facilities in the state or the role the facilities play in the administration\u2019s immigration agenda. The White House did not respond to a request for comment. In court documents related to the arrest of Khalil, the administration said overcrowded facilities and bedbugs in the Northeast led to its decision to send him to Louisiana.",
      "Khalil, a legal permanent resident and pro-Palestinian protest leader at Columbia University, was arrested at his apartment building in New York City on March 8, before being shuttled to a detention center in New Jersey and then taken some 1,000 miles away to the Central Louisiana ICE Processing Center in Jena, Louisiana.",
      "Khalil\u2019s lawyers are fighting to have him returned to the Northeast and released in a case challenging his arrest and detention that was recently moved to a New Jersey court. Meanwhile, his separate deportation proceedings have begun playing out in front of an immigration judge in Louisiana.",
      "Last week, Alireza Doroudi, a doctoral student from Iran who was studying at the University of Alabama, was arrested off campus by federal immigration authorities with little known about his case. Immigration and Customs Enforcement\u2019s detainee locator has since revealed Doroudi was also taken to the Central Louisiana ICE Processing Center in Jena.",
      "The same day, Tufts University doctoral student Rumeysa Ozturk, a Turkish national who was in the United States with a valid student visa, was pulled off the street on her way to break her Ramadan fast with friends in an arrest by plainclothes agents captured on video.",
      "She was taken to the South Louisiana ICE Processing Center in Basile, Louisiana, which holds female detainees.",
      "Ozturk was transferred to Louisiana without the administration notifying her legal team, her lawyers said in court documents. The documents said that her location was withheld for nearly 24 hours. Her lawyers said moving Ozturk to Louisiana was consistent with \u201cICE\u2019s pattern and practice of moving people detained for their speech to distant locations incommunicado and in secret.\u201d",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio said last week\u00a0that the State Department has revoked 300 or more student visas, as the White House increasingly targets foreign-born students whose main transgression seems to be activism. The administration has accused some of the students of engaging in activities and activism supporting Hamas, which the students and their attorneys deny.",
      "Some considerations the federal government takes when placing immigrants in detention are how long someone might be in detention, the current availability of beds as well as a person\u2019s nationality, said Kathleen Bush-Joseph, a policy analyst with the U.S. Immigration Policy Program at the Migration Policy Institute, a nonpartisan think tank.",
      "\u201cDeportation proceedings for people who are detained move much faster than those who are released, because the immigration courts prioritize those cases,\u201d she said.",
      "Louisiana became a hub for holding thousands of immigrants in ICE custody during Trump\u2019s first term, as the administration expanded the detention of migrants and asylum-seekers.",
      "\u201cLouisiana has detained more immigrants than any other state, save Texas,\u201d Yanik said.",
      "There are currently more than 7,000 immigrants detained by ICE in Louisiana, according to the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse based at Syracuse University. There are nearly 48,000 people in ICE custody nationwide, the highest number since 2019.",
      "Reports of human rights abuses",
      "NBC News has previously reported on allegations of human rights abuses in Louisiana detention facilities. In 2024, a report by the Department of Homeland Security documented problems at the Basile facility including a mosquito infestation and a lack of sufficient medical staff.",
      "In an August 2024 report titled \u201cInside the Black Hole,\u201d multiple groups said they documented \u201csystemic human rights abuses\u201d against immigrants in the facilities, which included the detention centers in Jena and Basile where the students have been taken.",
      "\u201cThere was deprivation of human necessities, abusive and discriminatory treatment. There was medical abuse and neglect,\u201d said Sarah Gillman, a co-author of the report and the director of Strategic U.S. Litigation at the nonprofit Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights.",
      "The report and others have documented for years that detainees also are exposed to unsanitary conditions, including yellow, undrinkable water; moldy food; insect infestations; and inadequate access to basic hygiene supplies.",
      "Gillman said the rights groups also found that in past cases, immigrants detained in Louisiana lacked access to lawyers and faced other major obstacles such as a lack of translators and having to prepare important documents in their deportation cases in English, a language some of them didn't speak.",
      "\u201cWe met many, many, many people who didn\u2019t have access to lawyers who could help them, didn\u2019t have access to their families, didn\u2019t have access, really, to the outside world,\u201d she said.",
      "GEO Group, which runs the facilities where the students are detained, did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the allegations in the report.",
      "ICE did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the report and allegations of human rights abuses in its Louisiana facilities. But it previously told NBC News during the Biden administration that it \u201ctakes its commitment to promoting safe, secure, humane environments for those in its custody very seriously \u2014 the agency provides comprehensive policy and strict oversight for the administrative custody of one of the most transient, diverse populations of any correctional or detention system in the world and holds firm to continuous review of the many factors relevant to the continued operation of each of its facilities.\u201d",
      "The students detained in Louisiana are in deportation proceedings before an immigration judge, in a court system that is separate from the criminal justice system. A concern of immigration attorneys and advocates is that any appeal in the students\u2019 cases would fall under the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which is among the most conservative jurisdictions in the country.",
      "The jurisdiction where an immigrant is detained has \u201cvery different precedents which can really affect the outcomes of immigrants\u2019 cases and requests for everything from release from detention to the grant of asylum or other immigration benefits,\u201d Bush-Joseph said."

      "The NFL has decided that the chain gang no longer measures up.",
      "During the 2025 season the NFL will determine whether teams have reached a first down by using Sony\u2019s Hawk-Eye system of six, 8K cameras placed around each stadium that will optically track the position of the ball. In announcing the change Tuesday, the NFL said in a press release that the technology had been tested \u201cextensively\u201d last season.",
      "The chain gang, the nickname of the team of officials that walk onto the field in critical moments to measure whether the ball has gone 10 yards, will \u201cremain on the field in a secondary capacity,\u201d the league said. But they will remain background players as the cameras judge the difference between where the ball is spotted and the line to gain.",
      "\u201cAs on-field officials are notified of the measurement outcome, virtual recreations of measurements are produced in real time for the in-stadium and broadcast audience,\u201d the league said.",
      "According to the NFL, the Hawk-Eye system will be operated from its centralized, New York-based officiating center, where it will be integrated with the NFL\u2019s existing system for evaluating replays. Measuring using the Hawk-Eye system takes around 30 seconds, which the league claims saves up to 40 seconds from using the traditional method.",
      "In an increasingly tech-oriented sport, the use of the chain gang had become an anachronism, and its efficacy a never-ending source of debate. The latest came in January, when Josh Allen, the Buffalo quarterback and league Most Valuable Player, was ruled short of a first down during the AFC championships against Kansas City, although replays suggested he had reached a first down.\u00a0The camera-assisted measurement system would not have necessarily led to a first down in that case, however, because the referees\u2019 spot of the ball remains paramount \u2014 and the spot remains at times an imperfect judgment call made by an official.",
      "Hawk-Eyes cameras will be installed in every NFL stadium as as well international stadiums hosting NFL games.",
      "The move is in line with a trend of major leagues increasingly relying on computerized analysis in hopes of reducing human error. Major League Baseball for the first time used a computerized system to determine balls and strikes during spring training this year, although the \u201crobot umpires\u201d are not working the regular season."

      "\u201cLooking back to 2010, something just wasn\u2019t right,\u201d Michael Barnett said in a 2019 interview with U.K. outlet\u00a0ITV news.",

      "In a 2023 court deposition shown in the documentary, Barnett also said Grace told him she already had a monthly period.",

      "Did the Barnetts change Natalia Grace\u2019s legal age?",
      "According to an affidavit for probable cause filed by the state of Indiana in 2019, the Barnetts legally changed Grace\u2019s age birth certificate to say she was born in 1989, aging her up from 8 to 22, in June of 2012.",
      "The couple rented an Indiana apartment for Grace to live in on her own starting in July of 2013, according to the affidavit.

      "What did Natalia Grace say about her age?",
      "Grace has always maintained that she was a young child when she was adopted, and has said Kristine Barnett forced her to lie about being an adult.",

I didn\u2019t know what she would do to me,\u201d Grace says in the documentary. \u201cShe threatened me into telling people lies. At first I said, \u2018No, I\u2019m a kid,\u2019 and I guess she just got so mad.\u201d",
      "In the documentary, Grace also says she was initially unaware that the Barnetts had filed a court motion to charge her legal birthdate from 2003 to 1989. Grace says these legal proceedings took place after the Barnetts sent her away to Larue Carter Hospital, a psychiatric facility in Indianapolis, Indiana.",

      "\u201cI just really want people to see the truth,\u201d she says.",
      "In an emotional scene, Grace is told that her DNA test results found she was about 22, meaning she was definitely a child when she was adopted by the Barnetts.",

      "Gossweiler shows X-rays of Grace\u2019s teeth from that examination, and he says that at the time, Grace \u201chad 12 baby teeth remaining.\u201d",

      "\u201cYou can\u2019t fake teeth coming in like this,\u201d he says.",

We got Jack Black this week ... We will be fine.\u201d",

    "summary": "What is the true story of the Netflix documentary \"Con Mum\"? About Graham Hornigold, his mom Dionne, where hthey are now and more.",
    "story": [
      "The Netflix documentary \u201cCon Mum\u201d is the story of one man\u2019s dream-turned-nightmare. Graham Hornigold, a London-based pastry chef, grew up fantasizing about his birth mother. Then in 2020, he says in the documentary, a woman reached out saying she was the mother he never knew.",
      "She said that she \u201cnever stopped loving\u201d Hornigold, he says in the documentary. After a series of specific questions, Hornigold says he was convinced the woman knew enough details about his life to be his mother.",
      "So, Hornigold and his pregnant wife, Heather Kaniuk, also a pastry chef, went to meet her. What came next is the story of \u201cCon Mum.\u201d",
      "\u201cYou believe she is who she says she is. But she is a destroyer of lives,\u201d Hornigold says in the documentary.",
      "The rest of the documentary follows Hornigold's story, and how he says the woman claiming to be his long-lost mother conned him out of hundreds of thousands of dollars.",
      "The woman claimed she was dying of cancer and wanted to leave her vast fortune to Hornigold, he says in the documentary. Swept up into her world, Hornigold became closer to the woman, ultimately staying with her when his wife and newborn went to New Zealand and helping her pay bills.",
      "Eventually, Hornigold says in the documentary, he awakened to the woman's con. By then, he had given her money \u2014 a total of \u00a3300,000, he says in the documentary \u2014 and his marriage had ended.",
      "The devastating final twist? A DNA test shown at the end of the documentary concludes that the woman was indeed Hornigold\u2019s biological mother.",
      "How did 'Con Mum' happen?",
      "In an interview with TODAY.com, clinical psychologist Natalie Feinblatt, who specializes in trauma recovery for people who\u2019ve left high-control groups and cults, says \u201canyone\u201d is susceptible to scams \u2014 but Hornigold\u2019s origin story left him particularly vulnerable.",
      "Raised by a stepmother and father to whom he is no longer close, Hornigold says he often wondered about his mother growing up. \u201cIt\u2019s quite painful, not knowing your mother. You haven\u2019t got your mum,\u201d he says in the documentary.",
      "\u201cReuniting with a lost parent taps into deep psychological needs for connection and origin,\" Feinblatt says. \"For someone who may already carry questions about identity or belonging, the desire to believe the story can override red flags. Scammers often exploit that window of vulnerability \u2014 not because the victim is naive or foolish, but because they\u2019re human.\u201d",
      "In Hornigold\u2019s case, Feinblatt says the con struck at the the \u201ccore\u201d of his attachment system, an insight he echoes in the documentary.",
      "\u201cThe realization kicks in that this woman is not who she says she is. Because of a cellular level need for acceptance and for a mother, I have been played,\u201d Hornigold says in the documentary.",
      "Dorcy Pruter, a therapist who specializes in parental reunification, tells TODAY.com the maternal connection likely blinded Hornigold to seeing the situation clearly.",
      "\"When someone comes along offering that relief, even if it\u2019s wrapped in red flags, the heart can override the brain.\"",
      "Dorcy Pruter",
      "\u201cPeople with unresolved childhood trauma or identity wounds are especially susceptible because they\u2019re not just looking for answers \u2014 they\u2019re looking for relief. And when someone comes along offering that relief, even if it\u2019s wrapped in red flags, the heart can override the brain,\u201d Pruter says.",
      "For any victim of a scam, Feinblatt emphasizes the healing process can take a long time, because it requires \u201crebuilding a sense of safety and reality\u201d beyond just recovering what has been lost.",
      "Betrayal is accompanied by symptoms like anxiety, depression, hypervigilance and a sense of shame, coupled with the inability to trust instincts.",
      "\u201cPeople often describe feeling like the ground has dropped out from under them \u2014 confused, destabilized, and unsure who they can turn to,\u201d Feinblatt says.",
      "She sees value in documentaries like \u201cCon Mum,\u201d which show ordinary people being conned.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s this myth that \u2018only gullible people get scammed,\u2019 when in reality, scams are often sophisticated, targeted and deeply emotional. Seeing real people go through these experiences helps normalize the pain of betrayal and shows that it can happen to anyone,\u201d she says.",
      "\u201cAnybody can fall prey to this at the wrong place, at the wrong time. It just has to hit you in your in your vulnerable spot \u2014 and you\u2019re in,\u201d she continues. \u201cA lot of people don\u2019t like to look at it. It\u2019s scary to consider.\u2019"

      "\"Bluey\" has captured the hearts of both parents and children ... and it nabbed the top spot as the most streamed show of 2024.  It was streamed for 55 billion minutes last year. Not bad for 9-minute animated shorts with just three seasons.",

      "Though the core four Heelers get the vast majority of the screentime, there are a number of other characters who inhabit their world and add charm and warmth to the show.",
      "Here's a full rundown of who's who in the Blueyverse.",
      "Bluey",
      "As the title character, Bluey is a seemingly inexhaustible font of energy. She starts off the series as a 6-year-old and then turns 7 in the \"Pass the Parcel\" episode.",
      "She's generally a caring big sister to Bingo and she loves any game that involves role play. (Her stint as Granny Janet is particularly entertaining.)",
      "Bingo",
      "Bluey's little sister can be a bit shy, but she learns to use her Big Girl voice. She begins the series as a 4-year-old and turns 5 in the second season.",
      "Just like many little sisters, Bingo is a bit more fearful than Bluey and appreciates some extra reassurance from her sister and her parents, especially when life gets \"trifficult.\"",
      "Dad (Bandit)",
      "Bluey's dad Bandit is a lovable clown who is generally in the mood for an imaginative game. Bandit has two older brothers, Rad and Stripe, with whom he tends to be competitive. He works as as an archeologist (and loves to dig up bones).",
      "In typical dad fashion, he loves sports, barbecues and horseplay. But he's also willing to sit and empathize with his daughters, adjusting his behavior to be more sensitive when needed.",
      "Mum (Chilli)",
      "Chilli really breaks down the mom stereotype of always being the patient nurturer. In many episodes, Chilli appears to be short-tempered or frustrated with her kids, and she teaches them that moms sometimes need a time out, just like kids do.",
      "\"I need 20 minutes where no one comes near me,\" Chilli once told her husband as soon as he came home from work.",
      "She also teaches her daughters how to throw a stick, she fixes the broken toilet, she plays field hockey and she works as a \"sniffer\" dog in airport security.",
      "Muffin",
      "Muffin is Bluey and Bingo's younger cousin. Her parents are Aunt Trixie and Uncle Stripe. Having Muffin around gives Bingo the chance to be a big kid.",
      "Muffin has to get loud to get heard, and she's still learning how to take turns. And if she's skipped her nap, watch out!",
      "Aunt Trixie",
      "Aunt Trixie is Muffin\u2019s mom, and she's not afraid to tease the grownups.",
      "She plays games \u2014 and hockey \u2014 with the kids, and she can't resist a freshly opened bag of chips.",
      "Uncle Stripe",
      "Uncle Stripe is married to Aunt Trixie, and he's competitive with his brother Bandit. He is a big \"Stump Fest\" fan.",
      "Aunty Brandy",
      "Voiced by actress Rose Byrne, Aunty Brandy is Chilli's older sister.",
      "The show suggests that Brandy struggled with infertility and had to distance herself from Chilli's family as a result. In \"The Sign,\" however, we see the sisters reunite ... and Brandy is pregnant!",
      "Calypso",
      "Calypso is Bluey's teacher. She is remarkably calm, fair and patient \u2014 and she's very good at knitting.",
      "Chloe",
      "Chloe is one of Bluey's best friends, and she's a total pro at the monkey bars. Her favorite TV show is \"Chutney Chimp.\"",
      "Coco",
      "Coco and Bluey have known each other since they were babies \u2014 their mums used to bring them to the same infant class. Coco is the youngest of nine and her mom helped Chilli learn that babies hit milestones in their own time.",
      "Indy",
      "Indy, one of Bluey's friends, is a free spirit ... with everything except her diet. She cannot eat wheat, gluten, sugar, salt, dairy and many other additives.",
      "Nana",
      "Nana's house rule is that everyone gets what they want ... which mostly works out for the best. She is patient and sensitive to her grandchildren's feelings, and she loves telling jokes.",
      "Grandad",
      "Grandad is Chilli's father. Currently retired, he loves canoeing, bush walking and eating curried sausages. He is reluctant to change his active lifestyle but knows how much Chilli wants him to take care of himself.",
      "Frisky",
      "Frisky is Chilli's friend and Bluey's godmother. She met her husband-to-be, Uncle Rad, while acting as a \"double babysitter\" for Bingo and Bluey. The tension before her wedding is a major plot point of \"The Sign.\"",

      "Uncle Rad is Bandit's oldest brother. He used to work on an oil rig far away, and he would delight his nieces on his infrequent visits. But when he married Frisky at the end of Season 3, they decided to set up house in Brisbane, so he'll see them more often now.",
      "Bobo",

It\u2019s a defining moment in Mavis\u2019 career, symbolizing her personal commitment to fighting for authentic representation in the fashion industry.",
      "\u201cThis moment in the finale feels like a culmination of everything Mavis has been working for,\u201d Buteau tells TODAY.com. \u201cInclusivity isn\u2019t just about ticking boxes; it\u2019s about creating spaces where everyone can truly see themselves.\u201d",
      "As Mavis works through her professional turmoil, she also grapples with unresolved feelings for her ex, Luca (Marouane Zotti). Their brief reunion in the finale provides a bittersweet moment, filled with uncertainty. Their exchange leaves viewers questioning whether this is the start of something new or simply a nostalgic revisit to the past.",
      "\u201cMavis has come a long way in learning to love herself first,\u201d Buteau says. \u201cNow, the question is \u2014 can she share that love with someone else without losing the growth she\u2019s made?\u201d",
      "Throughout the season, Mavis relies heavily on her chosen family \u2014her friends \u2014 who provide support, wisdom, and humor during some of her most trying times. This concept of chosen family is a central theme of the finale and serves as a reminder that relationships, whether biological or not, can be just as meaningful and life-changing.",
      "As the season closes, fans are left with lingering questions about Mavis\u2019 future. Will her reconciliation with Luca lead to something more? Will her newfound business ventures thrive? And how will her personal life evolve in the wake of her career\u2019s growth?",
      "For now, though, the season finale cements the show's messages of self-love, authenticity and inclusivity. Whether in fashion, friendship, or love, \"Survival of the Thickest\" argues the key to success is staying true to yourself and the people who support you.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re all on our own journeys,\u201d Buteau says. \u201cBut at the end of the day, the love we give to ourselves \u2014 and the people we surround ourselves with \u2014 defines everything.\u201d"

      "The Israeli military Monday issued sweeping evacuation orders covering most of Rafah, indicating it could soon launch another major ground operation in the southernmost city in\u00a0the Gaza Strip.",
      "The evacuation orders appeared to cover nearly all of the city and nearby areas. The military ordered Palestinians to head to Muwasi, a sprawl of squalid tent camps along the coast. The orders came during\u00a0Eid al-Fitr, a normally festive Muslim holiday\u00a0marking the end of the fasting month of Ramadan.",
      "The order came after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu repeated a demand on Sunday for Hamas to disarm and for its leaders to leave Gaza as he promised to\u00a0step up pressure\u00a0on the group\u00a0while continuing\u00a0efforts\u00a0to\u00a0return\u00a0hostages.",
      "He said\u00a0Israel would work to implement U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s\u00a0\u201cvoluntary emigration plan\u201d for Gaza and said his cabinet\u00a0had agreed to keep pressuring\u00a0Hamas, which says it has agreed to a ceasefire proposal from mediators Egypt and Qatar.",
      "Senior\u00a0Hamas official Sami Abu Zuhri said Netanyahu\u2019s comments were a recipe for \u201cendless escalation\u201d in the region.",
      "Netanyahu rejected assertions that Israel, which has resumed its\u00a0bombardment of Gaza\u00a0after a two-month truce and sent troops back into the enclave, was not negotiating, saying \u201cwe are conducting it under fire, and therefore it is also effective\u201d.",
      "\u201cWe see that there are suddenly cracks,\u201d he said in a video statement issued on Sunday.",
      "On Saturday,\u00a0Khalil al-Hayya, the Hamas leader in Gaza, said the group\u00a0had agreed to a\u00a0proposal\u00a0that security sources said included the release of five Israeli hostages each week.\u00a0But he said\u00a0laying down its arms as Israel has demanded\u00a0was a \u201cred line\u201d the group would not cross.",
      "On Sunday, the first day of the Muslim Eid al-Fitr holiday, health authorities in Gaza said at least 24 people, including several children, had been killed in Israeli strikes. Nine were killed in a single tent in the southern city of Khan\u00a0Younis, they said.",
      "Later on Sunday, the Palestinian Red Crescent Service said it had finally been able to get access to search for rescue teams that had come under Israeli fire during a rescue mission in western\u00a0Rafah, a week after the attack.",
      "It said it had recovered 13 bodies from the scene, seven of them were Palestinian Red Crescent members, another five were from the Gaza Civil Emergency Service, and another was a United Nations worker. There was no immediate Israeli comment.",
      "Since Israel resumed its attacks in Gaza on March 18, hundreds of Palestinians have been killed and tens of thousands have been forced to evacuate areas in northern Gaza where they had returned following the ceasefire agreement in January.",
      "Netanyahu said Israel was demanding that Hamas lay down its arms and said its leaders would be allowed to leave Gaza. He gave no detail on how long Israeli troops would remain in the enclave but repeated that Hamas\u2019s\u00a0military and government capacities must be crushed.",
      "\u201cWe will ensure general security in the Gaza Strip and enable the implementation of the Trump plan, the voluntary emigration plan,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is the plan, we do not hide it, we are ready to discuss it at any time.\u201d",
      "Trump originally proposed moving the entire 2.3 million population of Gaza to countries including Egypt and Jordan and developing the Gaza Strip as a U.S.-owned\u00a0resort. However, no country has agreed to take in the population and Israel has since said that any departures by Palestinians would be voluntary.",
      "Israel launched its campaign in Gaza after a devastating Hamas attack on Israeli communities around the Gaza Strip on Oct. 7, 2023, that killed 1,200 people, according to an Israeli tally, and saw 251 abducted as hostages.",
      "The Israeli campaign has killed more than 50,000 Palestinians, according to Palestinian health authorities, and devastated much of the coastal enclave,\u00a0leaving hundreds of thousands of people in tents and makeshift shelters.",
      "Sunday\u2019s strikes took place as Palestinians celebrated the Eid holiday marking the end of the Muslim fasting month of Ramadan.",
      "\u201cWe are here to celebrate the rituals of God amid the destruction and the sounds of cannons,\u201d said Minnatallah Al-Far, in Jabalia, in northern Gaza, where most of the area has been laid waste by Israeli bombardment.",
      "\u201cIn Gaza, our situation is very difficult. Other people are celebrating these rituals in peace and safety, but we do them amid destruction and bombardment,\u201d she said.",
      "In Israel, Netanyahu has faced a wave of demonstrations since the military resumed its action in Gaza, with families and supporters of the remaining 59 hostages joining forces with\u00a0protesters\u00a0angry at government actions they see as undermining Israeli democracy.",
      "On Sunday, he rejected what he described as \u201cempty claims and slogans\u201d and said military pressure was the only thing that had returned hostages."

That\u2019s if he ends up going at all.",

      "Potential U.S. visitors such as Ihsanullah are expressing growing uncertainty about their travel plans amid the crackdown and warnings from U.S. embassies in more than a dozen countries, like the one in Sweden that said anyone entering the U.S. on a visa is a \u201cguest\u201d and if you lie about your intended behavior while in the country, \"You\u2019re out.\u201d",
      "Earlier this month, a Lebanese doctor working at Brown University's medical center was sent home despite having a valid U.S. visa after U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents searching her phone found photos and videos they said were \u201csympathetic\u201d to the former leader of the Hezbollah militant group, whose funeral she told agents she attended last month.",
      "Such searches pre-date the new Trump administration, and Customs and Border Protection says it conducts them to detect \u201cdigital contraband, terrorism-related content, and information relevant to visitor admissibility.\u201d",
      "\u201cClaims that CBP is searching more electronic media due to administration change are false,\u201d CBP Assistant Commissioner Hilton Beckham told NBC News in an emailed statement.",
      "\u201cAllegations that political beliefs trigger inspections or removals are baseless and irresponsible,\u201d he added.",
      "Such searches are not new to travelers from parts of the world who already face stringent visa requirements \u2014 Chinese students arriving in the U.S., for example, have complained in recent years of being increasingly subject to interrogation and detention on national security grounds.",
      "But many of the cases in recent weeks have involved travelers from countries such as France, Germany and Canada \u2014 longtime allies with which the U.S. shares intelligence, has frequent cultural exchanges and does hundreds of billions of dollars in trade. Several of those held have spoken out about being scrutinized and sometimes locked up for days at the border.",
      "Last week, France\u2019s interior minister said a French researcher had been turned away by U.S. border agents after they found messages on his phone criticizing the Trump administration. The CBP said searches of the researcher's electronic media devices \u2014 they have not been named by the French authorities \u2014 led to the \u201cdiscovery of proprietary information\u201d from a U.S. laboratory.",
      "CBP does not need a warrant to search the phones of any travelers arriving at the U.S. border, including airports, said Saira Hussain, a senior staff attorney at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a nonprofit digital rights group based in San Francisco.",

      "Other travelers have found themselves unexpectedly detained.",
      "Jasmine Mooney, a Canadian woman who was reapplying for a U.S. work visa, was detained without explanation on March 3 at the Mexican border near San Diego and spent 12 days in detention before returning home. She wrote in The Guardian that she was  detained after she was questioned about the status of her visa, which had been granted following an initial rejection.",
      "\u201cThere is no communication, you don\u2019t have an officer to talk to,\u201d Mooney told MSNBC last week. \u201cYou can\u2019t contact your lawyers or your friends or your family.\u201d",
      "When Rebecca Burke, a backpacker from Britain, tried to enter from Canada in February, she spent nearly three weeks at a detention center.\u00a0In a statement to the BBC, the Northwest ICE Processing Center said Burke was repatriated after being detained \u201crelated to the violation of the terms and conditions of her admission.\u201d",
      "Burke's family said it believes her detention was due to a misunderstanding about her accommodation arrangements, which were free in exchange for helping hosts with household chores and which her father says authorities may have suspected constituted employment in violation of her visa.",
      "And U.S. citizen Lennon Tyler said she was chained to a bench by border agents last month when her German fianc\u00e9, Lucas Sielaff, was accused of violating the rules of his 90-day U.S. tourist permit while trying to enter from Mexico. Sielaff was detained for two weeks before returning to Germany, according to The Associated Press.",
      "Such incidents have prompted some governments to issue warnings for their citizens traveling to the U.S. The updated British travel advisory reads \u201cyou may be liable to arrest or detention if you break the rules.\u201d",

      "Travelers\u2019 rights vary depending on their status \u2014 whether they are U.S. citizens, legal permanent residents or foreign visa holders \u2014 and their port of entry. Almost a quarter of the nearly 47,000 searches of electronic devices conducted at U.S. borders in the last financial year were of U.S. citizens, according to CBP data.",

      "Visa holders who refuse a search of their devices could see their visas revoked and be barred from entering the U.S., she added.",
      "Rules can vary across the country because the courts have largely avoided ruling on electronic device searches. Last year, a federal judge in New York barred CBP from warrantless searches of people\u2019s phones, but that applies only to John F. Kennedy International Airport.",

      "LONDON \u2014 The second Trump administration may have ruffled the feathers of America\u2019s allies, but there is also evidence it has boosted world leaders scrambling to deal with the White House\u2019s norm-busting approach.",
      "Some have gained plaudits for meeting Trump head-on, while others have taken a more nuanced line between flattering the president and trying to shore up their own interests against the headwinds blowing from Washington.",
      "Canada\u2019s Mark Carney is poised to win next month\u2019s election by volubly rejecting President Donald Trump\u2019s hostile advances to make his country the 51st state. On the flip side, Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum has earned accolades for becoming something of a Trump whisperer, deftly responding to his tariff threats and seeing her own popularity rise accordingly.",
      "In Europe, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer and French President Emmanuel Macron have received polling boosts following their widely praised Trump strategies. And the embattled Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has seen his numbers rise as he has tried to cope with Washington\u2019s brusque approach.",
      "\u201cThe standing of politicians who are having to deal with the crisis engendered by Trump\u2019s presidency is leading to a rise in their popularity, if they seem to be doing this in a reasoned and proper way,\u201d said Dominic Grieve, the former British attorney general and an ex-senior lawmaker for the Conservative Party.",
      "To be clear, Trump is no panacea for leaders. Macron and Starmer are still relatively unpopular and face harsh criticisms on domestic issues that will likely decide future elections. Likewise, good polling numbers will be of limited cheer for Zelenskyy while the future of his entire country is in doubt.",
      "Other analysts debate the extent to which this popularity boost is solely because of Trump, rather than the general climate of global instability and uncertainty of which Washington is a part.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not sure so how much it\u2019s a Trump bounce or more of a international crisis bounce,\u201d said Anand Menon, director of the think tank U.K. in a Changing Europe. \u201cInsecurity means that, initially at least, trust in the government goes up.\u201d",
      "Still, the abrupt change of tone and policy from the White House is an undeniable factor.",
      "Trump\u2019s attacks on Canada have seen a remarkable turnaround for Carney\u2019s Liberals. They were headed for historic losses, but Trump\u2019s onslaught has seen them ride a wave of renewed Canadian nationalism and lead the polls at 45% ahead of April 28\u2019s election.",
      "\u201cThe old relationship we had with the United States,\u201d Carney told a news conference Thursday, \u201cis over.\u201d",
      "Mexico\u2019s Sheinbaum has chosen a different tack, taking action on immigration and fentanyl trafficking \u2014 including sending 10,000 National Guard troops to the border. That earned a delay on Trump\u2019s tariffs, as well as praise from the U.S. president, who called her \u201ca wonderful woman.\u201d",
      "At home, she has mixed this strategy with a cerebral nationalism, telling voters that this is about \u201ccoordination, yes \u2014 submission, never.\u201d",
      "Her already high ratings have risen to 85%, according to the El Financiero newspaper in February.",
      "In the United Kingdom, Starmer\u2019s ratings have gone up 8.5 percentage points from February, according to the British pollster Ipsos. That followed an Oval Office meeting with Trump in which he mixed compliments with candor: talking up a potential trade deal while refusing to budge from a commitment to Ukraine.",
      "He has promised to hike British defense spending to 2.5% of GDP by 2027, part of the wider nervousness in Europe about Trump\u2019s commitment to the trans-Atlantic alliance.",
      "The economy and health care will likely decide the next election. But defense is now the third most important issue for British voters, most polls show. And it is defense and international trade on which voters think Starmer is performing best, according to the Ipsos poll taken between March 14 and 17.",
      "\u201cPretty much all of his readings have become somewhat less unpopular in the wake of his trip to Washington,\u201d said John Curtice, one of Britain\u2019s most respected polling experts and a professor at Scotland\u2019s University of Strathclyde. \u201cI think it\u2019s fair to say the public have noticed that he\u2019s risen to the challenge.\u201d",
      "Another man banging the drum on European defense is France\u2019s Macron. He and Starmer are leading an informal \u201ccoalition of the willing\u201d \u2014 a group of countries prepared to send troops to Ukraine to uphold any eventual ceasefire.",
      "Likewise, the current international upheaval has seen Macron\u2019s popularity jump to 31% in March, up 7 points from the previous month, according to an Ifop poll.",
      "These numbers are still relatively low, however, and they may well be fleeting. Macron can\u2019t run again in the next election, in 2027, but his centrist heirs risk losing the presidency to the far-right National Rally, the current favorite.",
      "The same is true for Starmer, whose Labour Party has slid from a landslide victory last year to near parity with the Conservatives and hard-right Reform U.K. Most voters are worried about high prices for food, energy and housing, rather than their leader\u2019s Oval Office repartee.",
      "For any leader enjoying a momentary upside, Menon, of U.K. in a Changing Europe, has a word of warning: \u201cI wouldn\u2019t get complacent on the back of the fact that, right at the moment, things are looking a little bit better because Trump uncertainty.\u201d"

      "The U.S. government accidentally deported a man to El Salvador because of an \"administrative error,\" landing him in a notorious megajail and leaving him stuck there in legal limbo, according to legal papers filed Monday.",
      "Kilmar Abrego Garcia came to the United States from El Salvador in 2011 and is a legal resident protected by a 2019 court order that prevented him from being sent back to his home country.",
      "But in court papers filed Monday, the government admitted that \"on March 15, although ICE was aware of his protection from removal to El Salvador, Abrego Garcia was removed to El Salvador because of an administrative error.\"",
      "Abrego Garcia lives in Maryland with his wife and 5-year-old child, who is autistic and intellectually disabled. The couple both work full-time, the filing says. NBC Washington first reported the deportation, and The Atlantic first reported the \"administrative error.\"",
      "Garcia\u2019s deportation comes as The Trump administration continues to deport hundreds of people to El Salvador, many of them from Venezuela and almost all bound for the maximum-security Terrorist Confinement Center, known by its Spanish acronym CECOT.",
      "The deportation appears to coincide with the departure of three planeloads of people to El Salvador on March 15. Lawyers for some of those who were deported said they were falsely accused of gang affiliations because of their tattoos.",
      "Garcia, his wife, Jennifer Vasquez Sura, and their legal team filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court in Maryland last week calling for Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem to ensure his return to the United States and for the government to stop paying El Salvador to keep him in prison.",
      "In its filing Monday, the government said the U.S. courts do not have jurisdiction to seek his release.",
      "Salvadoran government images show masked guards marching crowds of men with shaven heads inside the largest jail in Latin America.",
      "To her shock, Garcia's wife learned her husband was being detained only after she spotted him in an image in a news article with his head shaved and wearing white overalls, the lawsuit says. The men were kneeling, their faces obscured \u2014 but she said she spotted his tattoos and two scars on his head.",
      "The government, however, alleges that Garcia was an \"active member of the criminal gang MS-13,\" citing an unidentified informant at a 2019 bond hearing.",
      "Garcia's lawyers strenuously deny that and claim the government \"has never produced an iota of evidence to support this unfounded allegation.\" Garcia left El Salvador to escape gang violence, his lawyers say, after gangsters threatened to kill him in an attempt to extort his parents.",
      "Vice President JD Vance weighed into the case and falsely said Tuesday on X that Garcia was a \"convicted MS-13 gang member.\" Garcia has no criminal convictions in the United States or in El Salvador, his legal team said in the lawsuit.",
      "In a follow-up post Tuesday, Vance stood by his comments and called Garcia \"an illegal immigrant with no right to be in our country,\" despite the 2019 protection order against his removal from the country.",
      "\"We disagree that he is an MS-13 gang member.\u00a0The only basis of his gang membership was a confidential informant, there was never any hard and fast proof,\" Garcia\u2019s attorney, Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg, said in a statement to NBC News in response to Vance\u2019s posts.",
      "\"There is a judicial process.\u00a0They could have gone back to the judge who, in 2019, gave him an order of protection and could have asked that judge to lift that order.\u00a0They didn\u2019t do that, they just put him on an airplane,\" Sandoval-Moshenberg added.",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt also addressed the case Tuesday, reiterating the claim that he was a member of MS-13.",
      "On March 12, after he finished his shift as a sheet metal worker and picked up his child, Garcia was pulled over and arrested by Homeland Security agents, one of whom told him his \"status has changed,\" says a lawsuit calling for his release from last week.",
      "Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers told him that his wife had to collect the couple's child within 10 minutes or he would be handed over to Child Protective Services, the filing alleges.",
      "She arrived and found Garcia \"confused, distraught and crying,\" but she got no explanation for his arrest, the filing says.",
      "Garcia was interviewed and repeatedly asked about gang affiliations but told his wife that he was due to appear before an immigration judge and expected to be released. He then called her from a detention center in Texas, telling her he was about to be deported, the filing says.",
      "Garcia's lawsuit accuses the Department of Homeland Security, ICE and several Cabinet members named as defendants of deciding to deport him without following the law, in full knowledge that \"El Salvador tortures individuals detained in CECOT.\"",
      "\"Upon information and belief, they did so knowing and intending that the Government of El Salvador would detain Plaintiff Abrego Garcia in CECOT immediately upon arrival,\" the lawsuit says.",
      "The government's court filing Monday said members of Garcia's legal team \"have not clearly shown a likelihood that Abrego Garcia will be tortured or killed in CECOT.\"",
      "The human rights organization Cristosal reported last year that at least 261 people have died in Salvadoran prisons since 2022, while Human Rights Watch,\u00a0Amnesty International\u00a0and other groups have documented extreme crowding and torture at Salvadoran prisons, including CECOT.",
      "ICE did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "A DHS spokesperson said in a statement Tuesday that \"the individual in question is a member of the brutal MS-13 gang \u2014 we have intelligence reports that he is involved in human trafficking.\"",
      "\"Whether he is in El Salvador or a detention facility in the U.S., he should be locked up,\" the spokesperson added. \"Remarkable that The Atlantic and other MSM continue to do the bidding of these vicious gangs and ignore their victims.\"",
      "A judge in Greenbelt, Maryland, is due to hear the case Friday."

      "According to a Cyprus News Agency report issued late Monday that cited a criminal court announcement, the court found during closed-door proceedings that most of the contradictions in the woman\u2019s testimony concerned the identification of the perpetrators.",
      "The court said the woman\u2019s initial statement to investigators following the Sept. 3, 2023, alleged rape presented a number of \u201cweaknesses,\u201d which under the circumstances weren\u2019t \u201cout of the ordinary.\u201d",
      "But investigators\u2019 doubts regarding the woman\u2019s credibility grew when she offered \u201centirely incomprehensible and inconsistent\u201d explanations regarding the contradictions in her testimony, specifically regarding the identification of the perpetrators which also included a line-up.",
      "The court said the woman \u2014 who was 20 at the time of the alleged rape \u2014 was under the influence of a \u201csignificant\u201d amount of alcohol and the hallucinogens MDA and MDMA, popularly known as \u201cSally\u201d and \u201cMolly.\u201d",

      "All five of the Israeli men \u2014 then ages 19 and 20 \u2014 had pleaded not guilty to all the charges.",
      "Police had said the British woman picked the five Israelis out of a line-up as having raped her during a hotel pool party in the coastal resort town of Ayia Napa.",
      "The woman told police that one of the five men had forcibly taken her to his room after grabbing her hand while she was partying with friends around the pool.",
      "She said the man tried to remove her bathing suit while she pleaded with him to let her leave. The other suspects then entered the room and one had intercourse with her against her will and another forced her to perform oral sex, while two others held her down on the bed, she said.",
      "She said one suspect also held her against a wall and had intercourse with her.",
      "She said she managed to lock herself in the bathroom and began shouting for help. She was able to flee the room by pushing the suspects aside and rejoined her friends, who went with her to report the incident to the police, she said.",
      "The ruling came after the European Court of Human Rights ruled last month that Cyprus\u2019 law enforcement authorities failed to live up to their obligation to thoroughly and effectively investigate a British teenager\u2019s allegations that she had been gang-raped by a group of Israelis while on a 2019 vacation in Ayia Napa."

      "Tensions rose further after Vice President JD Vance suggested that Greenlanders would be better off being under the protection of the U.S. than under Denmark in a speech Friday to American service members at the Pituffik Space Base in the island\u2019s northwest.",
      "Denmark controlled Greenland for 300 years before it became a formal territory in 1953. Greenland gained home rule in 1979, although Copenhagen still controls its foreign and defense policy and contributes just under $1 billion to its economy.",
      "People started to boycott American products after Trump\u2019s inauguration, according to a March 1 survey by the market research firm Megafon for the Danish TV2 show. It found that every second Dane had refrained from buying American goods since then. And 1 in 5 also said they were less likely to visit the U.S.",
      "Elon Musk\u2019s Tesla appears to have been one of the companies hit. Sales of the company\u2019s vehicles in Denmark were down by almost half compared with last year, according to auto industry experts Bilstatistik.dk. As has been the case in other countries, some Danish Tesla owners have adorned their vehicles with stickers saying, \u201cNot a Elon Musk supporter.\u201d",
      "Tesla did not immediately respond to NBC News\u2019 request for comment. NBC News has also reached out to Netflix and Coca-Cola.",
      "Others are switching out more basic items such as canned goods, cola drinks and potato chips, while some stores have started to highlight where their products originate from.",
      "Spar convenience store chain locations have marked items produced in Denmark with the country\u2019s flag, and the supermarket chain Salling group, which has 1,700 stores dotted around the country, has marked products with a star if they originate in Europe.",
      "Stressing that the stars were not a call for consumers to boycott American goods, Henrik Vinther Olesen, the Salling Group\u2019s director of communication, said in an email Saturday that the stars were aimed at providing consumers with information about the origins of their products.",
      "\u201cWe are generally experiencing that customers shop like they usually do,\u201d he added.",
      "Two Danes, Henning Madsen and Ian Feldt, have also developed the \u201cMade O\u00b4meter\u201d app which allows people to take photos of the goods they are buying so they can find out where the product originated from. However, it is currently paused because it labeled American goods as European.",
      "Consumers like Peter Kolby were also thinking longer term, particularly when it came to the tech they are using.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t have a problem with American goods as such,\u201d he said in a telephone interview Monday. But the 31-year-old from the island of Fyn said he asked himself what he would do if \u201cTrump closed all American tech down for us overnight?\u201d",
      "\u201cWhen I hear this talk about Greenland, then I have to find alternatives to gmail, cloud, IOS, Microsoft,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cWe have to be able to stand on our feet, as Trump has said. And that is what we are doing.\u201d"

      "\u201cWe have shared our problems with them, stating that unilaterally expelling refugees is neither in their interest nor ours,\u201d Haqqani said. \u201cIt is not in their interest because expelling them in this way raises hatred against Pakistan.",

    "story": [
      "BANGKOK \u2014 Chinese rescuers have freed six people from the rubble of an earthquake in Myanmar, including a child and a pregnant woman, Chinese state media reported Monday, placing Beijing at the forefront of an international rescue effort from which the United States has been largely absent.",
      "Rescue teams from India, Malaysia, Russia, Thailand and other countries have already arrived in Myanmar, where the military-led government says the death toll from a 7.7-magnitude earthquake Friday has surpassed 2,000, a figure that is expected to rise.",
      "But a U.S. team has yet to appear at the scene of the quake in the Southeast Asian nation, which occurred the same day the State Department informed thousands of employees of the U.S. Agency for International Development, which administers civilian foreign aid, that nearly all of their roles were being eliminated.",
      "Critics have warned that President Donald Trump\u2019s cuts to U.S. foreign aid, which had previously accounted for less than 1% of the annual federal budget, could create an opening for authoritarian governments such as China and Russia that are trying to increase their global influence.",
      "The U.S. Embassy in Myanmar, one of the world\u2019s poorest countries, said Sunday in a post on X that the U.S. would provide up to $2 million in aid through Myanmar-based humanitarian assistance organizations.",
      "The embassy also said that a USAID emergency response team was \u201cdeploying to Myanmar to identify the people\u2019s most pressing needs, including emergency shelter, food, medical needs, and access to water.\u201d",
      "It was not immediately clear when the U.S. team would arrive in Myanmar, even as the country Monday marked the end of the crucial 72 hours since the quake after which the survival rate of people trapped in the rubble sharply decreases.",
      "The State Department said Monday that in the meantime, U.S. disaster experts in Bangkok, Manila and Washington are monitoring the situation in coordination with U.S. government counterparts in the region.",
      "\u201cI would reject the premise that the sign of success is that we are physically there,\u201d spokesperson Tammy Bruce said.",
      "The U.S. absence is being felt on the ground in Myanmar, a country of 54 million people that, in addition to the earthquake, has been embroiled in a civil war for four years.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve seen a broad cut in humanitarian aid, that\u2019s undeniable,\u201d Trevor Clark, UNICEF\u2019s regional chief of emergency, told NBC News in Bangkok on Monday. \u201cWhat we\u2019re focused on right now is just the immediate stuff. We\u2019ve been able to mobilize some internal resources, and we\u2019re confident that other sort of partners will step up.\u201d",
      "China has announced $14 million in assistance for Myanmar, including 1,200 tents, 8,000 blankets and 40,000 first aid kits. A team of 118 Chinese rescuers arrived in the country Sunday along with six rescue dogs and two vehicles, according to Xinhua, China\u2019s state-run news agency, in addition to 82 who arrived Saturday.",
      "Video from the state-run broadcaster CCTV showed two Chinese rescuers pulling a 5-year-old girl from the rubble of a collapsed apartment building early Monday in Mandalay, Myanmar\u2019s second-largest city, which was near the epicenter of the quake.",
      "The girl was carried down in the claw of an excavator, while a pregnant woman rescued from the same building was carried out on a gurney hooked to a zipline, video from Xinhua showed.",
      "Russia, meanwhile, has sent 20 rescuers, including dog handlers and drone operators, according to the Russian state news agency Tass, as well as three planes including an airmobile hospital.",
      "The international response to the earthquake is complicated by the civil war, with the delivery of aid hampered by \u201cdamaged roads, collapsed bridges, unstable communications, and the complexities related to civil conflict,\u201d the World Health Organization said Sunday.",
      "Myanmar\u2019s military government, which seized power in a 2021 coup, tightly controls access to the country and has continued bombing rebel forces in the days since the quake even as the country is rattled by aftershocks. But it has also sought international help, inviting \u201cany country\u201d to provide assistance.",
      "Thailand has sent a team to neighboring Myanmar even as it deals with its own casualties from the quake, which sent high-rises swaying in the Thai capital, Bangkok, hundreds of miles from the epicenter.",
      "Rescue efforts in Bangkok are centered on a 30-story building under construction that collapsed in the quake, trapping scores of workers.",
      "On Monday, rescuers recovered a 12th body from the wreckage of the building, out of the 19 people killed across the city. Nine people have been found alive while more than 70 others are still missing at the site of the building, where U.S. service members are working alongside the Thai military and other first responders.",
      "Even as rescue efforts continued for a fourth day, officials did not give up hope of finding more survivors. On Monday, Bangkok Deputy Gov. Tavida Kamolvej\u00a0said life-detection equipment had found a weak vital sign under the rubble, prompting Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra to leave the scene so rescuers could hear better.",
      "\u201cEvery second counts, it really counts,\u201d Tavida said.",
