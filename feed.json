      "There was concern that attendance and overall interest in women\u2019s college basketball would drop this year with the departure of Caitlin Clark, Angel Reese and other stars for the WNBA.",
      "Both took a dip -- but only a dip.",
      "With JuJu Watkins and Paige Bueckers and a host of other standout players leading the way, attendance across the country was just short of last season's record numbers in women's hoops and still the second-highest ever.",
      "More networks showed more games on TV this season and ratings were strong heading into March Madness that starts this week. ESPN will have the lion's share of tournament games again, but Fox increased its footprint in the sport with five games in primetime on Saturday nights and 18 total on the network.",
      "\u201cThere are great stars, great brands, we\u2019ve done more than we have done before and we\u2019re not alone in doing that,\u201d Fox Sports President of Insights and Analytics Mike Mulvihill said. \u201cThe 3-5-10 year trend clearly is an upward trend.\u201d",
      "While the network\u2019s overall ratings are down from last season\u2019s record mark that was due in large part to Clark being on Fox a lot, Mulvihill is happy with where they are.",
      "\u201cTo go from zero exposures a few years ago to 18 on our biggest platform speaks to the growth and interest in the sport,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s growing confidence in this building that we can put it on broadcast and justify it. I love that we are able to put games on in primetime. It means something to the coaches and players.\u201d",
      "Having great matchups helps. The game between Watkins\u2019 USC and Bueckers\u2019 UConn on Dec. 21 was shown in primetime after an NFL game and averaged 2.2 million viewers, peaking at nearly 3.8 million. That was the second-most watched women\u2019s game on the network behind only Clark\u2019s game last year when she set the NCAA scoring record.",
      "The network also helped spearhead two new tournaments this year with the Champions Classic and the Coretta Scott King Invitational. Both were renewed for next season.",
      "CBS showed the third matchup of the season between UCLA and USC, two of the top teams in the country, in the Big Ten title game and it drew 1.44 million viewers, trailing only last season's league championship which saw Clark and Iowa win.",
      "ESPN had big numbers with regular-season ratings up 3% from last year and 41% from two seasons ago. This was the most watched year for the network before the NCAAs since 2008-09 (the network didn't have many of Clark\u2019s regular-season games at Iowa last season).",
      "A doubleheader on Feb. 16 was huge for ESPN: UConn vs. South Carolina drew 1.8 million viewers while LSU vs. Texas had 1.7 million. In all, 15 games on ESPN networks averaged over 500,000 viewers, the most in a single year.",
      "ESPN, which owns the rights to the NCAA Tournament and shows women's games every week during the season, has faith that March Madness will deliver.",
      "Women's basketball programming director Dan Margulis knows that the network had a perfect storm last season to achieve the record ratings that saw the women's championship game outdraw the men. Clark, a generational player, had guided Iowa back to the championship game where they were facing an undefeated South Carolina team looking for its own place in history.",
      "\u201cWe're looking at early rounds and everything growing going into it,\u201d Margulis said. \u201cCompared to two years ago, we see that growth.\u201d",
      "It wasn't just the championship game that drew huge numbers. A rematch between Reese and Clark in the Elite Eight game was massive as well.",
      "\u201cCertainly the floor has risen dramatically,\u201d said lead ESPN announcer Rebecca Lobo. \u201cThe expectation for this year\u2019s tournament, Final Four or national championship shouldn\u2019t be what we saw a year ago. Will it be better than pre-Caitlin? That floor should be much higher than it was.\u201d",
      "While there isn't an undefeated team this year or a generational player like Clark on her last run, there is more parity in the sport.",
      "People aren\u2019t just watching on TV, but also showing up at games. The power conferences had strong attendance marks. The SEC led the way, setting numerous conference records, including total for its tournament and the mark in both the semis and the finals.",
      "The Big Ten had its second-highest average attendance in the last 15 years.",
      "\u201cGranted we get to see some of the best ones, but the energy was different throughout the country,\u201d Lobo said. \u201cThe South Carolina-LSU game on a Thursday night with 2,500 students has a different energy. The increase from students across the country has made for incredible environments.\u201d",

      "A federal judge has dismissed the charges against a Minnesota man accused of hiding a stolen pair of ruby slippers that Judy Garland wore in \u201cThe Wizard of Oz.\u201d Prosecutors informed the court Monday that he died Sunday",
      "ST. PAUL, Minn. -- A federal judge dismissed the charges Monday against a Minnesota man accused of hiding a stolen pair of ruby slippers that Judy Garland wore in the 1939 musical \u201cThe Wizard of Oz\u201d after prosecutors informed the court that he died on Sunday.",
      "Jerry Hal Saliterman, 77, of Crystal, who had been in poor health with lung disease and other ailments, had been scheduled to change his plea to guilty in January but that hearing was postponed indefinitely after he was hospitalized.",
      "Federal prosecutor Matthew Greenley notified the court in a one-page motion Monday that Saliterman died Sunday but did not say how or where. U.S. District Judge Patrick Schiltz granted the request and dropped the charges.",
      "Defense attorney John Brink confirmed Monday that his client had died but declined to give details. A spokesman for the U.S. Attorney's Office in Fargo, North Dakota, which is handling the case, did not immediately return a phone call seeking further information.",
      "According to court filings, Saliterman was hospitalized in early January \"for inability to walk and sepsis,\u201d an infection that can be life-threatening. He attended his arraignment three days later via video from what looked like a hospital room. In an update to the court late last month, Brink told the court that his client had been discharged to a hospice facility and that his prognosis was poor. An accompanying letter from his doctor listed severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease requiring supplemental oxygen and Parkinson's disease.",
      "Saliterman was in a wheelchair and on oxygen last March when he made his first court appearance. He was charged then with theft of a major artwork and witness tampering for his role in the ruby slippers case.",
      "The sequined red slippers were stolen in 2005 from the Judy Garland Museum in her hometown of Grand Rapids. Their whereabouts remained a mystery for nearly 13 years until the FBI recovered them in 2018. They fetched a record for movie memorabilia of $32.5 million in December, according to Heritage Auctions. The slippers were one of several pairs Garland wore during the filming. Only three other pairs remain.",
      "Terry Jon Martin, now 78, of Grand Rapids, used a hammer to smash the glass of the museum\u2019s door and display case to steal them. According to his attorney, an old associate with connections to the mob told him the shoes had to be adorned with real jewels to justify their $1 million insured value. But he got rid of the slippers when he learned they were fake, and they ended up with Saliterman. Martin pleaded guilty in 2023 and was sentenced last January to time served because of his poor health.",

      "Dequenne was only 18 when she was selected as best actress at Cannes in 1999. In \u201cRosetta,\u201d from Luc and Jean-Pierre Dardenne, she portrayed a teenager trying to escape her difficult life in a caravan park with an alcoholic mother. The film also won the Palme d\u2019Or that year.",

      "More recently, she co-starred in \u201cClose,\u201d Lukas Dhont\u2019s tender boyhood drama, which brought her back to Cannes again in 2022. She saw similarities between her young co-star and her own breakout role with \u201cRosetta.\u201d",
      "\u201cFor me to be here and to come back here after 23 years, it\u2019s very emotional and there is like a reflection between Eden (Dambrine) and myself because I remember when I was here the first time with \u2018Rosetta,\u2019\u201d she told The Associated Press. \u201cIt was like a very powerful movie with this main character, which is in every scene, every, every shot.

      "The White House added the song in a post of a man with his wrists handcuffed to his waist as he is patted down at an airport. The video was captioned with the song\u2019s lyrics: \u201cYou don\u2019t have to go home but you can\u2019t stay here.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe did not authorize or condone the White House\u2019s use of our song in any way. And no, they didn\u2019t ask.

      "PARIS -- An unprecedented exhibition at the Pompidou Center in Paris explores the presence and influence of Black artists in the city from the 1950s to 2000, offering a vibrant immersion in France's cosmopolitan capital and a history of anti-colonial, civil rights struggles.",
      "The \u201cBlack Paris\u201d exhibition features the works of about 150 major artists of African descent, many of whom have never or rarely been displayed in France before. Running from March 19 to June 30, it's one of the final shows before the museum closes for a five-year renovation later this year.",
      "\u00c9va Barois De Caevel, associate curator, said that the exhibition is \u201cunprecedented,\u201d with more than 300 paintings and sculptures by artists of various backgrounds.",
      "\u201cSome are African Americans, some are Caribbeans, some are Africans, and some are Afro-descendants,\u201d said Barois De Caevel, adding that the focus of the exhibit is not geography or race, but rather \u201cBlack consciousness,\u201d shaped by the history of slavery and experience of racism shared by Black artists.",
      "After World War II, many African American painters, musicians, and intellectuals flocked to Paris, seeking a sense of freedom that they couldn't find in the United States at the time. Barois De Caevel pointed out that for many, Paris represented a break from the racial segregation that they faced back home.",
      "\u201cMany enjoyed being free in the streets of Paris \u2014 being able to go out with white women, enter cafes, bars and restaurants, and be treated like white people,\u201d she said.",
      "\u201cBut they were not fooled,\" she added, noting that African American writer James Baldwin \"wrote about this early on, that in France, racism is especially targeting Black Africans and Algerians, who were really extremely mistreated. So it\u2019s an ambivalent relationship with Paris.\u201d",
      "The exhibition also shows how many African artists from French colonies \u2014 and later former colonies \u2014 came to Paris to join a political and intellectual movement fighting for civil rights and racial justice, while others from the Caribbean were supporting independentist movements, which were gaining strength there.",
      "Alicia Knock, curator of the exhibition, praised the ambitious scope of the show, which she described as \u201can incredible epic of decolonization,\u201d highlighting how Paris city served as both a \u201clab for Pan-Africanism,\u201d the movement that encouraged solidarity between peoples of African descent, and an \u201canti-colonial workshop.\u201d",
      "Visitors \u201cwill see how these artists contributed to rewriting the history of modernism and postmodernism,\u201d Knock said, and how they \u201dreframed abstraction and surrealism, and at the same time you will also see the Black solidarities that happened at the time.\u201d",
      "\"Many of these artists were not only creators, but also cultural ambassadors, teachers, poets, and philosophers,\u201d she added.",
      "For some coming from the U.S., Paris was also \u201ca gateway to Africa,\u201d Knock said, based on discussions she had with some of the artists' families: \"They told us that, in fact, they had come to Paris to go to Africa, and in the end they found Africa in Paris.\u201d",
      "The exhibition also includes installations from four artists chosen to provide contemporary insights, including Shuck One, a Black graffiti and visual artist native of the Caribbean island of Guadeloupe.",
      "In addition, the Pompidou Center has acquired around 40 of the show's artworks, which will remain part of the museum\u2019s collection.",
      "\u201cThis is just the beginning,\u201d Knock said. \u201cIt\u2019s a baby step for many French institutions, French museums and French universities to start working on these artists, start collecting them, writing about them, preserving their works in their archives and hopefully dedicating a lot of solo shows to many of these artists, because they really deserve it.\"",

      "Five new movies opened in wide release in North American theaters this weekend.",
      "Five new movies opened wide in North American theaters this weekend including a starry spy picture from Steven Soderbergh, an A24 thriller, a Looney Tunes movie and a high concept action-comedy with \u201cThe Boys\u201d star Jack Quaid. But the myriad options did not result in box office gold. When final receipts are tallied Monday, it\u2019s likely going be the lowest-grossing weekend of the year to date with around $54 million in total ticket sales.",
      "\u201cNovocaine\u201d led the pack with $8.7 million, according to studio estimates Sunday, which was slightly lower than expected. The film starring Quaid as a man who literally can\u2019t feel pain was released by Paramount Pictures in 3,365 locations this weekend. The studio also had early access showings the weekend prior, which are included in the total.",
      "The R-rated movie, directed by Dan Berk and Robert Olsen, got generally positive reviews with an 82% on Rotten Tomatoes. Exit polls were a bit more tempered with 4/5 on PostTrak and a B CinemaScore. It also made $1.8 million from 19 international territories bringing its total weekend to $10.5 million.",
      "The Bong Joon Ho and Robert Pattinson sci-fi \u201cMickey 17 \" and the spy pic \u201cBlack Bag\u201d were neck and neck for second and third place, both reporting $7.5 million weekends. \u201cMickey 17\" had the slight edge. It's still playing in 3,807 theaters, was down a steep 60% from its opening. That brings its domestic total to $33.3 million and its global total to $90.5 million against a reported $118 million budget.",
      "\u201cBlack Bag,\u201d the well-reviewed Soderbergh film with Cate Blanchett and Michael Fassbender, opened in 2,705 theaters to take third place. Audiences skewed male (56%) and over 35 (59%). The film, released by Focus Features, currently carries a 97% on Rotten Tomatoes. It also got a B CinemaScore.",
      "Other new openers included \u201cThe Day the Earth Blew Up: A Looney Tunes Movie,\u201d an animated film starring Porky Pig and Daffy Duck originally intended for the streaming service Max, and the faith based \u201cThe Last Supper.\u201d Ketchup Entertainment handled the Looney Tunes theatrical release in 2,827 theaters where it earned $3.2 million. Pinnacle Peak Pictures released \u201cThe Last Supper\u201d in 1,575 theaters to $2.8 million in ticket sales. Both came in behind Disney and Marvel\u2019s \u201cCaptain America: Brave New World,\u201d which earned $5.5 million in its fifth weekend in theaters.",
      "The new A24 movie, \u201cOpus,\u201d opened outside of the top 10 with an estimated $1 million from 1,764 screens. Starring Ayo Edebiri and John Malkovich as a legendary pop star who has suddenly reemerged on the scene after decades away, \u201cOpus\u201d premiered at the Sundance Film Festival to generally poor reviews. It's the first film from writer-director Mark Anthony Green.",
      "After a strong start to the year in which the box office was up 22%, several slow weekends that haven\u2019t surpassed $60 million in total ticket sales have left the domestic box office at a 5% deficit.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a momentum business,\u201d said Paul Dergarabedian, the senior media analyst for Comscore. \u201cIt\u2019ll ratchet up with \u2018Snow White\u2019 next weekend. And the good news is we probably won\u2019t see the 50s again until August.\u201d",
      "With final domestic figures releasing Monday, this list factors in the estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to Comscore.",
      "1. \u201cNovocaine,\u201d $8.7 million.",

      "MIAMI BEACH, Fla. -- The mayor of Miami Beach, Florida, wants to terminate a lease and cut financial support for an independent film theater that screened an Oscar-winning documentary about the conflict between Palestinians and Israelis.",
      "Mayor Steven Meiner introduced a resolution describing the film \u201cNo Other Land\u201d as antisemitic. City commissioners will discuss the resolution Wednesday during their next meeting.",
      "\u201cNo Other Land\u201d opened last Friday at O Cinema, located at the Miami Beach Historic City Hall. Meiner had reached out several days before the premiere to discourage O Cinema CEO Vivian Marthell from showing the film.",
      "\u201cThe City of Miami Beach has one of the highest concentrations of Jewish residents in the United States,\u201d Meiner said in his letter to Marthell. \u201cThe \u2018No Other Land\u2019 film is a one-sided propaganda attack on the Jewish people that is not consistent with the values of our City and residents.\u201d",
      "Marthell initially agreed not to screen the movie in a response to Meiner, but the showing went on as scheduled.",
      "\u201cMy initial reaction to Mayor Meiner\u2019s threats was made under duress,\u201d Marthell said in a email Thursday. \u201cAfter reflecting on the broader implications for free speech and O Cinema\u2019s mission, I (along with the O Cinema board and staff members) agreed it was critical to screen this acclaimed film.\u201d",
      "O Cinema has always been committed to sharing films that not only entertain, but also challenge, educate and inspire meaningful dialogue, Marthell said.",
      "\u201cWe understand the power of cinema to tell stories that matter, and we recognize that some stories \u2014 especially those rooted in real-world conflicts \u2014 can evoke strong feelings and passionate reactions. As they should,\u201d Marthell said. \u201cOur decision to screen \u2018No Other Land\u2019 is not a declaration of political alignment. It is a bold reaffirmation of our fundamental belief that every voice deserves to be heard.\u201d",
      "In December and January, the city of Miami Beach executed two grants worth about $80,000 for O Cinema, according to the mayor's proposed resolution. About half the money has already been paid, but the resolution would stop the rest. The city began leasing space to O Cinema in 2019 with the ability to terminate the contract with 180 days of notice, which is what Meiner is seeking to do.",
      "\u201cNo Other Land,\u201d which was shot between 2019 and 2023 and released last year, was directed by a group of Israeli and Palestinian filmmakers: Basel Adra, Hamdan Ballal, Yuval Abraham and Rachel Szor.",
      "\u201cWhen the mayor uses the word antisemitism to silence Palestinians and Israelis who proudly oppose occupation and apartheid together, fighting for justice and equality, he is emptying it out of meaning,\u201d Abraham said in an email. \u201cI find that to be very dangerous.\u201d",
      "The film documents the destruction of Palestinian villages in the West Bank by the Israeli military. It won the Academy Award for best documentary feature as well as earlier awards.",
      "While the film has earned wide praise from film critics, it has also drawn controversy.",
      "\u201cFreedom of expression is an important value, but defamation of Israel into a tool for international promotion is not art,\u201d Israeli culture minister Miki Zohar said in a social media post.",

      "DETROIT -- Who killed Donald Goines?",
      "Producers of a documentary on the life of the prisoner-turned urban fiction writer of novels about the violence, drugs and prostitution that he surrounded himself with in Detroit are hoping the answer hasn't been lost to time \u2014 or the streets.",
      "It's been more than 50 years since Goines and his common-law wife, Shirley Sailor, were found shot to death on Oct. 21, 1974 in their flat in Highland Park, a small enclave of Detroit. Each had been shot five times. Their two young children were home at the time of the killings.",
      "Goines was 37.",
      "No arrests were made and rumors swelled. Some speculated the killings had something to do with Goines' heroin addiction. Others nodded to the theory that the fictional subjects of his novels appeared a bit too much like the real-life hustlers, pimps, drug dealers and stickup men who prowled the city's streets.",
      "\u201cThere have been at least a half-dozen, quite possibly a dozen, elements of speculation as to how Mr. Goines and the mother of his children were murdered,\u201d said Bill Proctor, a private investigator hired to find the killer or killers. \u201cBut no one has come forward with enough information to charge the persons responsible.\u201d",
      "Proctor said a $5,000 reward being offered by the producers of the documentary might help \u201cshake the trees\u201d and find \u201csomeone who might still be alive or have an understanding\u201d of the facts of the case.",
      "Goines wrote 16 books over a span of several short years. His raw, stark and undiluted writings are filled with the urban street life imagery of the late 1960s and early 1970s.",
      "\u201cDopefiend,\u201d was published in 1971. Fifteen more including \u201cStreet Players,\u201d \u201cDaddy Cool\u201d and \u201cKenyatta's Last Hit,\u201d would follow over the next three years. The titles and the content resonated with many Black readers, especially in Detroit where Goines' books often held prominence on living room coffee tables and bookshelves.",
      "\u201cWhen I read his books, I can visualize \u2014 I can picture what he\u2019s writing about,\u201d said his daughter, Donna Sailor. \u201cHe was so descriptive about what he wrote. That\u2019s kind of like how it was back then.\u201d",
      "Donna Sailor was 2 when her parents were killed. She doesn\u2019t remember anything about the shooting or her parents.",
      "\u201cWe would see friends of the family that knew my dad and my mom,\u201d Sailor, 52, told The Associated Press Thursday. \u201cThey would say she was a sweetheart, and she was funny and had a great smile.\u201d",
      "Less information about Goines was volunteered, though, she added.",
      "\u201cNo one ever went into great detail about him. They would say he was a nice guy,\u201d said Sailor.",
      "The urban lit genre dates back at least to 1967, and the release of the memoir \u201cPimp,\u201d written by Robert Maupin, who also was in jail when he began writing under the name Iceberg Slim. Maupin built a large word-of-mouth following and one of his readers was Goines. Generations later, hip-hop stars like Tupac Shakur were also inspired by the books and have referenced Goines and Iceberg Slim in their recordings. Shakur even once declared: \u201cMachiavelli was my tutor, Donald Goines my father figure.\u201d",
      "Goines' parents owned a clothes-cleaning and other businesses in Detroit and were part of the city's Black middle class. He enlisted in the Air Force and spent time in Korea and Japan during the Korean War. It was there Goines became addicted to heroin, according to various reports on his life.",
      "After his time in the military, Goines returned to Detroit in the mid-1950s. He drifted into the city's criminal underbelly, finding himself jailed for various crimes.",
      "Holloway House published Goines' novels from 1971 to 2008, according to current publisher Kensington.",
      "Under Kensington, Goines books have sold about 500,000 copies in print, alone. He consistently is one of Kensington's top reordered authors and his books have been \u201cselling at a stronger pace\u201d since it launched a reissue program in 2020, according to the company.",
      "Robert (Tape) Bailey and Craig Gore are the driving forces behind the documentary which is expected to be released by the end of the year. Both read Goines\u2019 books while incarcerated, separately.",
      "Bailey, 49, was born in Detroit and now lives in Los Angeles. He spent time in federal prison as young man for possession with intent to deliver drugs in Ohio.",
      "Goines wrote in detail about things he had witnessed firsthand, Bailey said.",
      "Gore, 51, of Los Angeles, stumbled onto Goines while serving time for burglary and theft. He says that through the $5,000 reward, they hope to bring more accuracy to the documentary.",

      "\u201cTelevision is hard, you know? Like, I hear myself complaining about it; I know it\u2019s a first world problem, but you get very attached when you\u2019re doing a series. You're living with the character for quite a long time.\"",
      "So, there Henry was at 3 a.m. on a night shoot of \u201cClass of \u201809,\" wearing prosthetics as his character\u2019s future self, when his manager presented him with the script for \u201cDope Thief.\u201d \u201cWithin the first 10 pages I was incredibly attracted to Ray and also the bond he has with Manny.\u201d",
      "Time off otherwise really hasn't been his thing (hence the laughter), but Henry is quick to remind that he\u2019s had two long breaks from acting. One was during the lockdown phase of the pandemic, and the other was during the Hollywood strikes.",
      "\u201cWhen you\u2019re a person that\u2019s constantly on the move and the universe tells you to sit your (expletive) down, you kind of have to listen,\u201d said Henry. \u201cI don\u2019t think I would have stopped had the universe not said stop.\u201d",
      "Production was underway on \u201cDope Thief\u201d when the Hollywood guild strikes were called in 2023. Henry opted to stay in Philadelphia.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t go anywhere. I made sure to be there just in case,\" said Henry, who for the first time was an executive producer on the project. He wanted to be close in proximity to his local crew. They had a cookout with bouncy castles. \u201cI would explore, or we'd go tubing and I would drive to this little town called New Hope that has a wonderful ice cream shop called Moo Hope. It was truly amazing to be present and experience that part of life for myself.\u201d",
      "Henry doesn't just bond with the crew on his sets but actors too, often walking away with new friends who happen to be very famous, like, say, Julia Roberts \u2014 whom he's currently filming a movie with in London. \u201cShe's somebody I truly cherish,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s never going to stop being weird to me,\" Henry admits. \u201cThe part that is really hard for me \u2014 that I\u2019m still fighting with \u2014 is when they tell me they\u2019re fans of my stuff and I\u2019m just like, \u2018Shut up!\u2019 I literally say it to their face.\u201d",
      "The biggest revelation about working alongside these accomplished actors is that Henry is now one of them.",
      "\u201cAt the end of the day, now, these are my peers, these are my contemporaries, and I can\u2019t continue to act like they\u2019re not. I can\u2019t continue to act like I have to shrink myself to fit in these spaces. I no longer have to do that. And what I also love is that they\u2019ll reaffirm that for me, too ... and that's the great part.\u201d",

      "Harvey Weinstein\u2019s #MeToo retrial next month will largely be an abridged version of the original, with one big addition: a charge based on an allegation from a woman who wasn\u2019t a part of the first case",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Harvey Weinstein 's #MeToo retrial next month will largely be an abridged version of the original, with one big addition: a charge based on an allegation from a woman who was not a part of the first case.",
      "But at a key pretrial hearing Wednesday, the disgraced movie mogul\u2019s lawyers cautioned that because Weinstein\u2019s 2020 rape and sexual assault conviction was overturned, the past isn't prologue \u2014 it's almost entirely irrelevant.",
      "\u201cWe can take that transcript and all the judge\u2019s rulings and throw them in the garbage,\" Weinstein\u2019s lawyer, Arthur Aidala, argued. \u201cThat trial was declared illegal by the highest court in this state.\"",
      "New York\u2019s Court of Appeals threw out Weinstein\u2019s conviction last year, setting the stage for a retrial starting April 15 in state court in Manhattan. Prosecutors say it could take about five weeks.",
      "How the retrial will play out began to take shape Wednesday as Judge Curtis Farber ruled on a number of outstanding issues, including expert testimony and the language used to describe the accusers.",
      "Farber granted a prosecution request to call a psychologist, Dawn Hughes, as an expert witness on the psychological and traumatic effects of rape and sexual assault. Hughes previously testified for actor Amber Heard at Johnny Depp\u2019s libel trial against Heard in 2022 and as a prosecution witness in singer R. Kelly\u2019s federal sex trafficking trial in Brooklyn in 2021.",
      "The judge also granted a defense request to preclude the term \u201csurvivor\u201d from being used to describe Weinstein\u2019s accusers. He told prosecutors to instruct any police officers who testify to refer to the women as \u201ccomplaining witnesses\" instead.",
      "While Weinstein\u2019s convictions from the first trial were thrown out, his acquittals on the most serious charges \u2014 two counts of predatory sexual assault and first-degree, or forcible, rape \u2014 still stand.",
      "Given that, Farber ordered prosecutors to instruct one of the accusers testifying at the retrial not to used the word \u201cforce\u201d when describing her alleged assault.",
      "The Manhattan district attorney's office had wanted to exclude any mention of Weinstein\u2019s acquittals and vacated conviction, but Farber said he could be obligated to clue them in depending on how the accuser testifies.",
      "\u201cDoes she have to use the word force? She can describe what happened and let the jury draw its own conclusions?\u201d the judge asked. \u201cI am not asking her to change her testimony from the first trial. I am asking her to refrain from using the word force.\"",
      "Other decisions were made behind closed doors as Farber met with the prosecution and defense for more than an hour in his chambers to discuss matters still under seal.",
      "They included a prosecution request that two of the three accusers in the case be allowed to testify about other alleged encounters with Weinstein. They also discussed evidence of the accusers' sexual history, which prosecutors say should be barred under New York's Rape Shield Law.",
      "Weinstein, 72, was in court for Wednesday\u2019s proceedings, arriving from jail in a wheelchair and suit and holding a stack of documents. Before the public portion of his hearing began, the ex-studio boss watched as Farber spent a few minutes resolving another matter that had been delayed by their closed-door discussions.",
      "At his last court appearance in January, Weinstein had implored Farber to start the retrial sooner.",
      "He told the judge \u201cI don\u2019t know how much longer I can hold on\u201d with cancer, heart issues and harsh conditions at New York City\u2019s Rikers Island jail complex, where he is locked up. Farber said he may hold jury selection a few days sooner if a murder trial he's overseeing wraps up ahead of schedule.",
      "Weinstein is being retried on charges that he forcibly performed oral sex on a movie and TV production assistant in 2006 and raped an aspiring actor in 2013. The additional charge, filed last September, alleges he forced oral sex on a different woman at a Manhattan hotel in 2006.",
      "Prosecutors said in court papers that the woman, who has not been identified publicly, came forward to them just days before the start of Weinstein\u2019s first trial but was not part of that case. They said they did not pursue the women\u2019s allegations after Weinstein was convicted and sentenced to 23 years in prison, but they revisited them and secured a new indictment after his conviction was thrown out.",
      "Farber ruled in October to combine the new indictment and existing charges into one trial.",
      "Weinstein\u2019s lawyers contend that prosecutors prejudiced him by waiting nearly five years to bring the additional charge, suggesting they had elected not to include the allegation in his first trial so they could use it later if his conviction were reversed.",
      "Weinstein has denied that he raped or sexually assaulted anyone.",
      "In vacating Weinstein\u2019s conviction, the Court of Appeals ruled that the trial judge, James M. Burke, unfairly allowed testimony against him based on allegations from other women that were not part of the case. Burke is no longer on the bench and such testimony won't be part of the retrial.",
      "Weinstein was convicted in Los Angeles in 2022 of another rape. His 16-year prison sentence in that case still stands, but his lawyers appealed in June, arguing he did not get a fair trial.",

      "The cargo van she was riding in flipped over and was then hit by a truck on March 1, music producer and Stone\u2019s longtime manager Walter Millsap III has said. Everyone else in the van survived except Stone, who was 63. Online tributes from fans and fellow artists poured in after her death.",
      "Friday's service is set for 11 a.m. at Word of Faith Cathedral in Austell, Georgia, just west of Atlanta.",
      "On Saturday, a service is planned at First Nazareth Baptist Church in Columbia, South Carolina.",
      "The church-grown singer was born in Columbia, where music was always in her life since she was a child, Stone told the AP in 1999 interview. Her mother would sing around the house, and her father sang gospel and blues at establishments around Columbia.",
      "Stone was a member of the all-female hip-hop trio The Sequence and known for the hit song \u201cWish I Didn\u2019t Miss You.\u201d She helped form The Sequence, the first all-female group on the hip-hop trailblazing imprint Sugar Hill Records, becoming one of the first female groups to record a rap song.",
      "The group recorded \u201cFunk You Up,\u201d which has been sampled by numerous artists, including Dr. Dre.",
      "After finding success in the early 1980s, Stone later joined the trio Vertical Hold before launching her solo career.",
      "Stone created hits like \u201cNo More Rain (In This Cloud),\u201d which reached No. 1 for 10 weeks on Billboard\u2019s Adult R&B airplay chart; \u201cBaby\u201d with legendary soul singer Betty Wright, another No. 1 hit; and \u201cWish I Didn\u2019t Miss You\u201d and \u201cBrotha.\u201d",
      "She found a sweet spot in the early 2000s as neo-soul begin to dominate the R&B landscape with the emergence of singers like Erykah Badu, Jill Scott, Maxwell and D\u2019Angelo.",
      "Her 2001 album \u201cMahagony Soul\u201d reached No. 22 on the Billboard 200, while 2007\u2019s \u201cThe Art Of Love & War\u201d peaked at No. 11.",
      "A Soul Train Lady of Soul winner, Stone went on to showcase her acting chops with film roles in \u201cThe Hot Chick\u201d starring Rob Schneider, \u201cThe Fighting Temptations,\u201d which starred Cuba Gooding Jr. and Beyonc\u00e9, and \u201cRide Along\u201d led by Ice Cube and Kevin Hart.",
      "She also hit the Broadway stage as Big Mama Morton in \u201cChicago,\u201d and she showcased her vulnerability on the reality TV shows \u201cCelebrity Fit Club\u201d and \u201cR&B Divas: Atlanta.\u201d",

      "A beloved reindeer in Alaska's biggest city is fighting for his life after falling mysteriously falling ill after someone tampered with his pen",
      "ANCHORAGE, Alaska -- An iconic reindeer so beloved that he has been in parades, featured on reality TV shows and visited by schoolchildren on field trips in Alaska's largest city is fighting for his life after mysteriously falling ill after someone tampered with his pen.",
      "Ever since, 8-year-old Star has had pneumonia, digestion issues and rapid weight loss. Star's owner, Albert Whitehead, has taken him to a veterinarian every other day to receive care and in hopes of finding a cause for the issues.",
      "\u201cI think we\u2019ve done everything possible for him,\u201d Whitehead said. Veterinarian Sabrieta Holland said she the reindeer's prognosis is \u201cguarded.\u201d",
      "Star lives in a fenced-in pen attached to Whitehead\u2019s house at the edge of downtown Anchorage. It\u2019s been over 20 years since someone last tried to tamper with the enclosure where reindeer named Star have been kept for the last seven decades. Star is the seventh in a line of reindeer to carry that name.",
      "In early January, someone cut a huge hole in the fencing to gain entrance, spending about five minutes inside with Star before taking off. What the person did in the pen is unknown, but Star began having stomach issues and dropping weight shortly after.",
      "Then, on Feb. 20, Anchorage police found the friendly and trusting reindeer wandering around downtown and returned him home.",
      "When Whitehead reviewed his security cameras, he found someone had used bolt cutters to remove padlocks off Star\u2019s pen and an alley gate. Star followed the man out into the neighborhood, and the reindeer wound up alone downtown, familiar streets because that's where Whitehead walks him.",
      "The next night, the situation turned more serious.",
      "Whitehead was watching the video feed when a man wearing a scarf over his face sprayed something from two different cans into Star\u2019s pen and twice hit the reindeer in the face with an unknown substance.",
      "Whitehead rushed outside to confront the man.",
      "\u201cI yelled at him to stop, \u2018What the hell are you doing? What are you spraying on the animal? Don\u2019t do that, quit that!\u2019\u201d Whitehead said.",
      "The man replied: \u201cI\u2019m trying to help Star.\"",
      "\u201cI have no idea what he meant by that,\u201d said Whitehead, who suspects \u2014 based on the smells \u2014 that the sprays could have been a disinfectant and deodorizer.",
      "Whitehead and police believe it was the same man from the prior night. It\u2019s not known if the January tampering involved the same person.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think the individual wanted to harm Star, but by his actions, he did,\u201d Whitehead said.",
      "Anchorage police posted the surveillance video on social media in hopes it would lead to the suspect\u2019s identity. So far, no viable tips have come in, spokesperson Christopher Barraza said in an email.",
      "Star's pneumonia worsened, and a cough leads Whitehead to believe Star ate something harmful, perhaps while loose.",
      "The pneumonia is likely due to him accidentally inhaling the chronic reflux or regurgitation of the contents in the largest of the reindeers\u2019 four stomachs, Holland said. The sprays possibly also contributed.",
      "It\u2019s possible there\u2019s a blockage, but the largest stomach of a reindeer is quite big and not easily obstructed, Holland said. However, ingested plastic bags causing chronic weight loss and indigestion problems are the most common foreign objects she's seen in reindeer.",
      "The next option would be surgery to look at the reindeer's abdomen and possibly remove any blockage, but it\u2019s generally a poor outcome, even in healthy deer, she said.",
      "The bond between Whitehead and Star is \u201cquite significant and precious,\" Holland said.",
      "\"Albert\u2019s daily life and reason for getting out for walks and such all are because of Star. And Star is really fond of Albert, too,\u201d Holland said in a text. \u201cIt will be quite devastating for him if he loses Star.\u201d",
      "Anchorage pioneers Oro and Ivan Stewart started the reindeer tradition, bringing the deer they received from an Alaska Native herder to Anchorage in the 1950s. Whitehead took over as caretaker from his friends in 2002.",
      "The average lifespan of a reindeer is about 15 years, but some Stars had long lives, like the first who lived to 23. Others didn't live as long, including the second Star, who was stolen, beaten to death and then butchered by a known Fairbanks meat thief. The third Star died after eating a plastic bag.",

      "If an algorithm designed a classic, big-screen spectacle for the small-screen age, \u201cThe Electric State\u201d probably wouldn\u2019t be too far off the mark.",
      "This is an Amblin-inspired, big-budget adventure with dystopian, science-fiction wonder, nostalgic callbacks, well-liked stars (Chris Pratt! Millie Bobby Brown! Stanley Tucci! Giancarlo Esposito! Ke Huy Quan!) and the directors ( Joe and Anthony Russo ) behind some of the highest-earning movies of all time.",
      "In theory, it should work. A kid on a dangerous, cross-country journey with a robot that may or may not be her brother whom she thought was dead? A reluctant, jaded adult companion who\u2019s quick with a one-liner? \u201cThe Electric State\u201d should be some future Spielberg\u2019s new favorite movie, the one that they\u2019ll reference in their Oscars speech as the thing that made them want to make movies. And yet it\u2019s lacking a spark and a soul that might distinguish it as memorable or special. Worse, considering everything it has going for it (including a reported budget that may have exceeded $300 million), \u201cThe Electric State\u201d is kind of dull.",
      "\u201cThe Electric State\u201d was loosely based on an illustrated novel by Simon St\u00e5lenhag that was released in 2018 and quickly scooped up for movie adaptation purposes with Marvel veterans Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely writing the script. Set in the early 1990s, this is a world in which service robots have risen up and demanded rights and freedom. The humans respond by going to war.",
      "This four-year war is skimmed over in a montage at the start of the film and, by 1994, Mr. Peanut (Woody Harrelson) is signing a peace treaty with Bill Clinton and the remaining robots are exiled to rot in the desert. The human victory was attributed to the drone creations of a Steve Jobs-ian tech billionaire Ethan Skate (Tucci), who is soon hawking his \u201cNeurocasters\u201d to the public. They scoop it up and soon society is just a bleak wasteland of screen zombies content to let their avatars work while they relax and fantasize a way out of their downtrodden existence.",
      "There are shades of \u201cThe Creator,\u201d \u201cWALL-E,\u201d \u201cReady Player One\u201d and many, many more films in here. But no one gets mad that something is derivative if it\u2019s also good. It\u2019s only when the kitchen sink references are so clear and come up so short that it becomes a real problem.",
      "Brown plays Michelle, an angry, orphaned teenager who lost her entire family not in the war, but in a car wreck. The one she misses the most is her little brother Christopher (Woody Norman, giving the best, most emotionally authentic performance in the film), a reluctant child prodigy. One day, a robot of a cartoon character they used to watch together turns up at her foster home, speaking only in the character\u2019s catchphrases. But after some gestures toward a photograph, she starts to believe that this robot is, somehow, Christopher, or at least someone who can lead her to the real Christopher. And thus starts their journey across America, and into the robot \u201cexclusion zone\u201d to figure out this puzzle. They soon team up with a war veteran/smuggler Keats (Pratt) and his snarky robot sidekick (Anthony Mackie, for your Marvel bingo card) and try to evade Esposito\u2019s robot bounty hunter.",
      "The robots they find in the exclusion zone are voiced by an army of celebrities you\u2019ll go insane trying to place before angrily resorting to IMDb, including Harrelson, Hank Azaria, Brian Cox and Jenny Slate. Their designs are thoughtful and remarkable and should evoke a sense of awe in the viewer at the sheer ingenuity behind this film, where many of the most impressive shots seem to be the recreations of St\u00e5lenhag\u2019s illustrations of dismantled, decaying robots. The action, however, gets mind-numbingly repetitive by the end of the bloated runtime.",
      "Pratt and Brown, while fine individually, don\u2019t really find their groove as partners on this journey either. Pratt is kind of just doing his thing and gets the few clever one-liners in the script. Brown, meanwhile, seems a little bored by yet another teen adventure role. And both ultimately look like movie stars in '90s cosplay, which might be a metaphor for the larger failure of the movie.",
      "\u201cThe Electric State\u201d was, of course, not made by algorithm, which is an admittedly cheap shot for a Netflix original. Unfortunately, it just feels that way.",
      "\u201cThe Electric State,\u201d a Netflix release streaming Friday, is rated PG-13 by the Motion Picture Association for \u201csci-fi violence/action, language and some thematic material.\u201d Running time: 128 minutes. One and a half stars out of four.",

      "President Donald Trump's team is looking at locations for a post-administration presidential library, and Florida may take that spot",
      "WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. -- President Donald Trump's team is already looking for locations for his presidential library, and Florida may be a top contender.",
      "A Florida legislator said Monday that the state has a \u201chigh likelihood\u201d of getting its first presidential library.",
      "Presidential libraries are significant for post-administration historical archives depicting materials from a former president's term. They require years of planning and don't use federal funding.",
      "Here are a few things to know about a potential Trump presidential library:",
      "The state Senate Rules Committee on Wednesday unanimously backed Sen. Jason Brodeur's bill that he said would \u201cprevent any municipality or county from imposing frivolous obstacles to the establishment of a presidential library within the state.\u201d",
      "Brodeur said other states that built presidential libraries had construction roadmaps created to follow state and local laws, and Florida would need the same. He also said all former presidents are welcome to put a presidential library in Florida, not just Trump.",
      "\u201cI anticipate that this will be a pretty popular attraction. It is somebody who\u2019s likely even the most famous developer in the world right now,\u201d he said.",
      "Brodeur's bill comes as Trump's team is looking at several South Florida universities \u2014 including Florida Atlantic University and Florida International University \u2014 as potential spots for a presidential library.",
      "A secretary at the FAU president\u2019s office said she had not heard of any plans for a presidential library and declined to comment further. Spokespeople for FAU and FIU, and the White House press office didn't immediately respond to messages about possible plans for a presidential library.",
      "Traditionally, such libraries are built in the state where a president was born or grew up. Trump, though, was born in New York, which voted against him in three straight presidential elections and which made him the first former president to be convicted of felonies last year.",
      "Trump now primarily lives in Florida, and he's filled his administration's ranks with politicians and others from the Sunshine State.",
      "Democrats raised concerns in committee hearings about whether local residents would bear the costs of the library's construction. Brodeur said all costs of building the library, including the planning costs, would fall to the president and library archives.",
      "In December, ABC News agreed to pay $15 million toward a Trump presidential library to settle a defamation lawsuit. In the agreement, ABC News described the payment as a \u201ccharitable contribution\u201d to an escrow account being managed by Trump's attorney.",
      "That's would amount to a small fraction of the overall cost of building the library. For example, former President Barack Obama\u2019s library in Chicago was estimated to cost $830 million as of 2021.",
      "Little is known about what would be in a Trump presidential library, but materials in these libraries usually include documents, artifacts or items significant to a president\u2019s administration.",

      "There's a crackling patter to \u201cBlack Bag\u201d \u2014 Steven Soderbergh\u2019s marital drama cloaked as a sleek spy thriller",
      "If you\u2019re hosting a dinner for half a dozen British intelligence agents with the aim of ferreting out a mole, what should you cook?",
      "For George Woodhouse (Michael Fassbender), who's preparing for four colleagues, plus himself and his wife, Kathryn St. Jean (Cate Blanchett), who, like him, is a high-level operative, it\u2019s chana masala with a few drops of truth serum.",
      "\u201cWill there be any mess to clean up?\u201d Kathryn asks her husband as they\u2019re getting ready.",
      "\u201cWith any luck,\u201d he responds.",
      "So goes much of the crackling patter of \u201cBlack Bag,\u201d Steven Soderbergh\u2019s delicious marital drama cloaked as a sleek spy thriller. Lean and taut, the 93-minute \u201cBlack Bag\u201d is more a sizzling amuse-bouche than full-course meal, but it\u2019s simmered to perfection.",
      "George and Kathryn, as fellow agents at London\u2019s National Cyber Security Centre, don\u2019t seemingly have what you might call a traditional marriage. Each has their own secret ops, leaving large swaths of their lives off limits to the other. When George asks where Kathryn is flying off to on Wednesday, she shrugs with a smile, \u201cBlack bag.\u201d",
      "In the movie\u2019s opening scene \u2013 a slinky tracking shot that trails George into and out of a nightclub \u2013 an agent named Meacham (Gustaf Skarsgard) gives him the assignment to track down the mole, with the added wrinkle that Kathryn can\u2019t be dismissed as a possible suspect. A cyber-worm device called Severus that\u2019s capable of hacking into nuclear facilities has gone missing. The fate of the world, as it so often is, is said to be at stake.",
      "But, really, the state of George and Kathryn\u2019s marriage is what interests us. Extreme though their situation is, their union is one that, like any couple, is built on trust and devotion, even if their professional lives demand the inverse. When George, lying on top of Kathryn tells her he\u2019d do anything for her, she coos, \u201cWould you kill?\u201d It's a fair-enough test to the bounds of wedded bliss, sure, but her second question matters even more. \u201cWould you lie?\u201d",
      "Over that dinner \u2013 a scintillating set piece around a darkened dinner table inside their London town house \u2013 we can quickly gather just how much the truth means to George. He\u2019s renown for his powers with a polygraph. As a youngster, he even brought down his own father, uncovering his affair. \u201cI don\u2019t like liars,\u201d George says through clenched teeth.",
      "They\u2019re joined by Colonel James Stokes (Reg\u00e9-Jean Page); the in-house psychologist Dr. Zoe Vaughan (Naomie Harris); the carousing spy Freddie Smalls (Tom Burke); and the newest NCSC recruit, cyber specialist Clarissa (Marisa Abela). Both are paired off in clandestine relationships that quickly emerge, among other secrets. More than state secrets, infidelity dominates the conversation.",
      "Fassbender\u2019s spook is an agent of precision. He wears gleaming black-framed glasses. When only a few drops of sauce land on his cuff, he immediately withdraws to change his shirt. Hard as it would seem, Fassbender has found a character almost as dispassionate and monotone as his methodical assassin in David Fincher\u2019s \u201cThe Killer.\u201d",
      "This time, though, he's not a loner. Blanchett\u2019s Kathryn is kept more at a remove from us. She\u2019s mysterious and aloof \u2013 a femme fatale, maybe, we\u2019re led to wonder. An \u201caroma of hostility\u201d accompanies her, Zoe tells her in a psych evaluation. Is she the mole?",
      "This is an insular film, taking place mainly in crisply composed interiors, aside from the lake George occasionally fishes for bass in. There, in a fitting encapsulation of a movie full of smooth surfaces with currents twisting underneath, the camera gently rests on the water's surface.",
      "\u201cBlack Bag\u201d follows a run of agilely directed thrillers by Soderbergh made with screenwriter David Koepp ( \u201cPresence,\u201d \u201cKimi\u201d). They are both at the height of their almost-too-easy powers; the script, especially, is peppered with delectable dialogue. Their movie adopts the air of menace and suspicion of a John Le Carr\u00e9 novel, yet hinges on the sturdiness of its married couple, like a super spy version of Nick and Nora from \u201cThe Thin Man\" or a more cerebral \u201cMr. & Mrs. Smith.\u201d",
      "All of the supporting players \u2013 while they make up a fine ensemble \u2013 are ultimately playthings in their game of love. In a casting coup, a former James Bond \u2013 Pierce Brosnan \u2013 drops in late in the film as Arthur Stheiglitz, the head of NCSC. In his handful of scenes, Brosnan is rageful and ferocious, chomping into both Ikizukuri (prepared live fish) and the scenery.",
      "His presence both enlivens a movie already humming with the uber-cool chemistry of Blanchett and Fassbender while transforming \u201cBlack Bag\u201d into a twisty rejoinder to that notoriously skirt-chasing spy. Here, Mr. Bond, is how sexy monogamy can be.",
      "While directing a satellite to peer down upon his wife on some unknown mission in Europe, George explains their mystifying dynamic to Clarissa: \u201cI watch her, and she watches me. If she gets into trouble, I will do everything in my power to extricate her.\u201d",
      "In her response, Clarissa speaks for everyone: \u201cThat\u2019s so hot.\u201d",
      "\u201cBlack Bag,\u201d a Focus Features release is rated R by the Motion Picture Association for language including some sexual references, and some violence. Running time: 93 minutes. Three and a half stars out of four.",

      "Former reality TV star Jessie Holmes has won the longest-ever Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race in Alaska",
      "NOME, Alaska -- Jessie Holmes, a former reality television star, won the longest-ever Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race on Friday, celebrating with fist pumps to a cheering crowd and posing for photos with his two floral wreath-adorned head teammates, Hercules and Polar.",
      "Holmes was first to the finish line in the Gold Rush town of Nome, on the Bering Sea coast. The race began March 3 in Fairbanks after a lack of snow forced changes to the route and starting point.",
      "That made the normally 1,000-mile (1,609-kilometer) race a staggering 1,129 miles (1,817 kilometers) across the Alaska wilderness. Holmes finished in 10 days, 14 hours, 55 minutes and 41 seconds.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s hard to put into words, but it\u2019s a magical feeling,\" Holmes said shortly after crossing the finish line. \u201cIt\u2019s not about this moment now. It\u2019s about all those moments along the trail.\u201d",
      "Holmes, who was competing for the eighth time, previously finished in the top 10 five times, including third last year and in 2022. In his first Iditarod, in 2018, his seventh-place finish earned him Rookie of the Year honors.",
      "Born and raised in Alabama, Holmes left at age 18 and worked as a carpenter in Montana for three years. He arrived in Alaska in 2004 and found adventure running dogs on a remote location of the Yukon River.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s been a truly amazing 10 days and I soaked in every part of it \u2014 the lows, the highs, the in-betweens. ... I\u2019m really proud of these dogs and I love them. And they did it. They deserve all the credit,\" Holmes said.",
      "He gave a special salute to his two lead canines, Hercules, his half-sprint dog, and Polar, saying, \u201cHe's the brains behind the operation.\u201d",
      "Holmes now lives in Nenana, where he works as a carpenter and lives a subsistence lifestyle. From 2015 through 2023, he was a cast member of \u201cLife Below Zero,\u201d a National Geographic program that documents the struggles of Alaskans living in remote parts of the state.",
      "Besides the lack of snow north of the Alaska Range that forced the change of starting point to Fairbanks, race organizers also had to make changes to the ceremonial start in Anchorage.",
      "With snow trucked in to cover streets in the state\u2019s largest city, the usual parade route there was shortened from 11 miles to under 2 miles (from about 18 kilometers to under 3.2 kilometers), and the number of dogs was reduced.",
      "Only 33 mushers started in Fairbanks, tied with 2023 for the smallest field ever. The drop in participants has raised concerns about the viability of the race, which has had to contend with inflation, climate change and pressure from animal rights groups.",
      "One dog died in this year\u2019s Iditarod: a pregnant female on the team of musher Daniel Klein, who under race rules scratched due to the death.",
      "Nearly a third of the mushers quit early, including eight who scratched and two who were withdrawn for not being competitive.",

      "The hero at the heart of \u201cNovocaine\u201d can't feel pain",
      "Nathan Caine may not be able to feel pain, as the tagline for the new action-comedy \u201cNovocaine\u201d reads, but the same does not apply to audiences.",
      "Although he doesn\u2019t scream when his leg is impaled with an arrow or when he sticks his hand in a vat of frying oil, you might. I certainly did. Out loud. In a theater. With other people. There may have been some phrases uttered entirely involuntarily too. Were other people reacting in the same way, I wonder? I couldn\u2019t hear them over my own groans. Hooray for the communal experience, I guess?",
      "This is, in some ways, a film for people who thought John Wick wasn\u2019t stabby enough. It delights in the relentless mutilation of its hero, a regular guy (played by Jack Quaid ) with a rare condition that has rendered him immune from feeling any sort of discomfort to bodily harm. Unlike such high concept premises as \u201cCrank,\u201d congenital insensitivity to pain analgesia (or CIPA) is actually real. But it\u2019s not exactly a superpower, Nate explains. He can still die; it just might be because he hasn\u2019t emptied his bladder in many hours. Or because he's accidentally bitten his tongue off eating a sandwich. These are real concerns of his.",
      "His entire existence is devoted to preventing these kinds of crises, mostly through tried-and-true baby proofing techniques like using tennis balls on sharp corners. Like Kelly Ripa before a show, he only consumes \u201cnon-chewing food.\u201d",
      "Work is stable and dull as an assistant manager at a bank. And dating is out of the question; He spends most of his free time playing online video games. Quaid, even with his two movie star parents, is somehow believable as this cautious introvert, though everything is played with a light touch and a wink. The movie, written by Lars Jacobson and directed by Dan Berk and Robert Olsen, even begins with the mournful R.E.M. anthem \u201cEverybody Hurts.\u201d",
      "Then Nate\u2019s life is changed one day when a pretty teller at the bank, Sherry (Amber Midthunder), asks him out to lunch, then to drinks and even spends the night. The next morning, things get even crazier: Sherry is taken hostage after a violent robbery at the bank. These guys are capital B bad (led by fellow nepo spawn Ray Nicholson) killing both the bank manager the cops outside. So what does Nate do? He steals a cop car and attempts to save her himself.",
      "\u201cDon\u2019t do it,\u201d pleads an injured cop as Nate hesitates before apprehending the car. It\u2019s hard to argue with the cop: Why not just let the professionals handle it, understaffed though they may be over the Christmas holiday? It would be a rather short and pointless movie if he did just leave it to the cops, but the impetus for this quest is a stretch to say the least. The conceit is missing some extra justification of why he felt like he was the only one who could do it, especially once he actually talks to said cops (Betty Gabriel and Matt Walsh).",
      "Like many things in \u201cNovocaine,\u201d it simply exists to open more avenues for his torture. This involves a fight in a restaurant kitchen, a visit to a tattoo parlor to get more information on one of the robbers, and a stop by a booby-trapped house. The script is self-aware enough to throw in a \u201cHome Alone\u201d reference, though not before you\u2019ve made one in your head.",
      "On the heels of some bad action comedies like \u201cLove Hurts,\u201d \u201cNovocaine\u201d is pretty enjoyable. It might have been born in the same elevator pitch incubator (what if non-stop violence!), but it\u2019s executed with some style and understanding of comedic timing. In one clever sequence, Nate persuades his psychotic captor to torture him as slowly as possible, buying time until his friend gets there as he pretends to feel the pain. \u201cNovocaine\u201d also kind of overstays its welcome, stretching on too long with too many endings. Still, it\u2019s an easy, if not entirely painless, watch.",
      "\u201cNovocaine,\u201d a Paramount Pictures release in theaters Friday, is rated R by the Motion Picture Association for \u201cstrong, bloody violence, language throughout, grisly images). Running time: 110 minutes. Two and a half stars out of four.",

      "A new report identifies ways to create resilient water and wastewater systems in communities hardest hit by climate change",
      "Malynndra Tome was helping to map livestock ponds in the Navajo Nation when she saw something that inspired her to act. An elderly woman was filling milk jugs with water at the back of a gas station in the Native American reservation, where about 30% of people live without running water.",
      "\u201cHow can we be living in the United States of America \u2026 one of the most powerful countries in the world, and people are living like this here?\u201d asked Tome, a citizen who grew up in the community of Ganado, Arizona, in the nation's largest Native American reservation at 27,000 square miles (69,930 square kilometers) in Arizona, New Mexico and Utah.",
      "A report published Tuesday identifies ways historically neglected communities most vulnerable to climate change, like Tome\u2019s, can create resilient water and wastewater systems. Its highlights include nature-based solutions, tailoring approaches to each community and using technology \u2014 all the while recognizing barriers to implementing them.",
      "\u201cWhat we hope to do with this report, what I hope, is that it actually gives people hope,\u201d said Shannon McNeeley, a report author and senior researcher with the Pacific Institute, which published the report with DigDeep and the Center for Water Security and Cooperation. \u201cIn spite of some of the major federal funding sources becoming uncertain and possibly not available, I think people will find other ways.\u201d",
      "Weather extremes made worse by climate change have disrupted people\u2019s access to water.",
      "In September, more than 100,000 residents in western North Carolina were under boil-water notices for nearly two months after Hurricane Helene destroyed much of a local water system. In January, several water providers declared their drinking water unsafe after wildfires roared through Los Angeles. One utility in Pasadena, California, sent out its first notice since it began serving water more than a century ago.",
      "Aging water systems leak trillions of gallons, leaving residents in some of the country\u2019s poorest communities with a substantial financial burden to fix them.",
      "An estimated 30% of the population in the Navajo Nation lives in homes that don\u2019t have running water, and many residents drive long distances to get water from public spigots, according to the Navajo Nation Department of Water Resources and the Natural Resources Defense Council.",
      "The report also notes that some federal resources and funding have become unavailable since Donald Trump returned to the White House. The Trump administration has cut or paused funding for critical water infrastructure projects, touted a reversal of diversity, equity and inclusion policies, and eliminated environmental justice policies meant to protect the communities the report centers on.",
      "Greg Pierce, director of the Human Right to Water Solutions Lab at the University of California, Los Angeles, said the report \u201ccomes at a very depressing moment where we're not going to see federal action in this space, it doesn't seem, for the next four years.\u201d",
      "The report synthesizes existing literature about water, climate change and solutions. Its authors reviewed academic studies, government and private reports and interviewed experts to identify ways low-income and communities of color can build water and wastewater systems to withstand extreme weather.",
      "The report highlights technology like rainwater harvesting and gray water reuse systems that can decrease water demand and increase resilience to drought. But it adds that implementing and maintaining technology like it can be too expensive for poorer communities.",
      "The report also advocates nature-based solutions such as wetlands, which studies find can reduce the length and severity of droughts, provide flood control, reduce or remove pollutants in water and protect water supplies. Communities across the country are increasingly recognizing the benefits of wetlands. In Florida\u2019s Everglades, for example, officials have spent billions of dollars to build engineered wetlands that clean and protect a vital drinking water source.",
      "The report argues for government-funded water assistance programs to help poorer households pay water and sewer bills, like the Low Income Household Water Assistance Program launched during the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "Gregory Moller, a professor in the soil and water systems department at the University of Idaho, notes that some approaches are too complex and expensive for smaller or poorer communities. \u201cOur innovations also have to be on a scale and stage that is adaptable to small systems,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s where I think some of the most serious challenges are.\u201d",
      "Some solutions the report highlights are benefiting communities. In the Navajo Nation, hundreds of solar-powered home water systems have brought running water to more than 2,000 people. Kimberly Lemme, an executive director at DigDeep, which is installing the systems, said it can be a complex and lengthy process. But it shows that solutions do exist.",
      "\u201cWater is a basic human right,\u201d said Tome, whose encounter with the elderly woman inspired her to pursue a doctorate in water resources. \u201cAnd in order for people to live productively, to have healthy lives, I think water is a big part of that.\u201d",

      "A new study out Monday finds that even in the most optimistic scenarios, grass-fed beef is no less carbon-intensive than industrial beef",
      "For cattle fattened in fields instead of feedlots, the grass may be greener, but the carbon emissions are not.",
      "A study out Monday in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences finds that even in the most optimistic scenarios, grass-fed beef produces no less planet-warming carbon emissions than industrial beef. The finding calls into question the frequent promotion of grass-fed beef as a more environmentally friendly option. Still, other scientists say grass-fed beef wins out on other factors like animal welfare or local environmental pollution, complicating the choice for conscientious consumers.",
      "\u201cI think that there is a large portion of the population who really do wish their purchasing decisions will reflect their values,\u201d said Gidon Eshel, a research professor of environmental physics at Bard College and one of the study's authors. \u201cBut they are being misled, essentially, by the wrong information.\u201d",
      "When it comes to food, beef contributes by far the most emissions fueling climate change and is one of the most resource- and land-intensive to produce. Yet demand for beef around the world is only expected to grow. And carefully weighing the benefits of grass-fed beef matters because in most parts of the world where beef production is expanding, such as South America, it\u2019s being done by deforesting land that would otherwise store carbon, said Richard Waite of the World Resources Institute.",
      "Experts say this study's finding makes sense because it's less efficient to produce grass-fed cattle than their industrial counterparts. Animals that are fattened up in fields instead of feedlots grow more slowly and don't get as big, so it takes more of them to produce the same amount of meat.",
      "The researchers used a numerical model of the emissions produced across the process of raising beef, then simulated many herds of industrial and grass-fed cattle. It compared differences in how much food they would eat, how much methane and carbon dioxide they would emit and how much meat they would produce. Those differences mirror real-life scenarios; cattle in arid New Mexico and lush northern Michigan have different inputs and outputs.",
      "Eshel and his team also analyzed previous studies that examined how much cattle grazing promotes carbon storage, but found that even in the best-case scenarios, the amount of carbon that grasses could sequester didn\u2019t make up for the emissions of the cattle.",
      "Randy Jackson, a professor of grassland ecology at University of Wisconsin-Madison who was not involved in the study, said he has found similar results in his own research showing that grass-fed beef has higher emissions assuming the same demand. In fact, Eshel's team cited his work. But he worries that the study is too focused on minimizing emissions \u201cwithout concern for the environmental impacts beyond GHG load to the atmosphere,\u201d like biodiversity and soil and water quality, he wrote in an email.",
      "The American Grassfed Association, a nonprofit membership group for producers of grass-fed livestock, did not immediately provide a comment on the study.",
      "Jennifer Schmitt, who studies the sustainability of U.S. agricultural supply chains at the University of Minnesota and also wasn't involved in the study, said she thinks the paper \u201chelps us get a little closer to answering the question of maybe how much beef should we have on the landscape versus plant proteins,\u201d she said.",
      "Schmitt said maybe if beef was scaled back on a large enough scale and if farmers could free up more cropland for other foods that humans eat, the localized environmental benefits of grass-fed cattle could make up for the fact that they come with higher emissions.",
      "It would be harder to convince Eshel, however. He thinks climate change is \u201csecond to none\u201d when it comes to global problems and should be prioritized as such.",
      "\u201cI have a hard time imagining, even, a situation in which it will prove environmentally, genuinely wise, genuinely beneficial, to raise beef,\" Eshel said.",
      "For consumers who truly want to be environmentally conscious, he added, \"don't make beef a habit.\"",

      "Arizona highest court has created a pair of AI-generated avatars to deliver news of all rulings issued by the justices",
      "PHOENIX -- Arizona's highest court has created a pair of AI-generated avatars to deliver news of every ruling issued by the justices, marking what is believed to be the first example in the U.S. of a state court system tapping artificial intelligence to build more human-like characters to connect with the public.",
      "A court in Florida uses an animated chatbot to help visitors navigate its website, but the Arizona Supreme Court is charting new territory with the creation of Victoria and Daniel. Made of pixels, the two avatars have a different job in that they serve as the face of news coming from the court just as a spokesperson made of flesh and blood would do \u2014 but faster.",
      "The use of AI has touched nearly every profession and discipline, growing exponentially in recent years and showing infinite potential when it comes to things as simple as internet searches or as complex as brain surgery. For officials with the Arizona Supreme Court, their venture into AI is rooted in a desire to promote trust and confidence in the judicial system.",
      "There was a protest outside the state Capitol last April and calls for two justices to be booted after the Arizona Supreme Court ruled that a Civil War-era law that banned nearly all abortions, except when a woman\u2019s life is in jeopardy, could be enforced. Emotions flared on both sides of the issue.",
      "When Chief Justice Ann Timmer took over the court last summer, she made public trust a key pillar of her platform. She had already been thinking about ways to reach out to the public using digital media for a few years, and the abortion ruling, among other rulings, helped her to solidify the idea that the court needs to be part of the narrative as people learn about opinions and what they mean.",
      "\u201cWe serve the public better by saying, OK, we\u2019ve issued this decision,\" she said. \"Now, let us help you understand what it is.\u201d",
      "Timmer told The Associated Press earlier this year that if the court had to do the abortion ruling over again, it would have approached the dissemination of information differently. In a Wednesday interview, she said that a news release and avatar video could have helped the public better understand the legal underpinnings of the lengthy decision \u2014 possibly including what it didn't do, which she said some misunderstood.",
      "\u201cWe got a lot of backlash for it and probably deservedly so, in terms of how can we complain that people don\u2019t understand what we did when we didn\u2019t really do enough to give a simplified version,\" she said in the January interview, explaining that people want to know the basis for the court\u2019s decisions and what they can do, such as lobbying state lawmakers for whatever changes in law would support their positions.",
      "Democratic Gov. Katie Hobbs signed a repeal of the ban last May, and in November, Arizona voters approved a constitutional amendment expanding abortion access up to the point of fetal viability.",
      "Created with a program called Creatify, Daniel and Victoria in a way bring to life the court's news releases. Videos featuring one or the other are being posted for every ruling by the high court, and may be used for Access to Justice projects, community programs and civics information in the future.",
      "The court has been sending out releases since October to summarize and explain rulings. After seeing success with the releases, it began exploring options to convey that information through video.",
      "The AI-generated avatars were the most efficient way to produce videos and get the information out, said court spokesperson Alberto Rodriguez. Producing a video usually can take hours, he said, but an AI-generated video is ready in about 30 minutes. The court might introduce more AI-generated reporters in the future, Rodriguez said in a news release.",
      "The justice who authors the legal opinion also drafts a news release, the wording of which must be approved by the entire bench. The justice then works with the court's communications team to craft a script for the avatars \u2014 the avatars aren't interpreting original court decisions or opinions, Rodriguez said.",
      "Daniel and Victoria's names and physical appearances were designed to represent a wide cross-section of people, Rodriguez said. He said they aren\u2019t meant to come off as real people and the court emphasizes their AI origins with disclaimers. The court is exploring different emotional deliveries, cadences and pronunciations as well as Spanish translations for the avatars, Rodriguez said.",
      "Mason Kortz, a clinical instructor at the Harvard Law School's Cyberlaw Clinic at the Berkman Klein Center for Internet & Society, described the court's new cyber employees as \"quite realistic.\" While their voices might give them away, he said some people could be fooled into thinking that Daniel and Victoria are real reporters if viewers are only reading the subtitles and looking at the characters' movements and facial expressions.",
      "Kortz also said it would be better for the language of the disclaimer that is in the videos' text description to be featured more prominently.",
      "\u201cYou want to make it as hard as possible for someone to advertently or inadvertently remove the disclaimer,\u201d he said.",
      "Asheley Landrum, associate professor at the Walter Cronkite School of Journalism and Mass Communication at Arizona State University, said the avatars feel robotic. She said a format that mimics real dialogue and storytelling might be more engaging than an AI reading of a news release.",
      "\u201cBecause it\u2019s not just about using AI or even creating videos,\u201d she said, \u201cbut about doing so in a way that really resonates with audiences.\u201d",
      "Still, it's fine line. She said engaging characteristics can help to build trust over time but the danger is that content could appear biased.",

      "Thousands of Food and Drug Administration employees are returning to the office to find overflowing parking lots, cramped workspaces and missing equipment",
      "WASHINGTON -- Thousands of employees returned to the Food and Drug Administration's headquarters Monday to find overflowing parking lots, long security lines and makeshift office spaces without chairs and other basic supplies.",
      "The FDA is the latest agency scrambling to meet the Trump administration\u2019s return-to-office mandate, part of a flurry of actions \u2014 including firings and buyouts \u2014 intended to radically shrink the federal workforce. Monday was the first day that all rank-and-file FDA staffers were required to report to offices, including the agency\u2019s 130-acre campus just outside Washington.",
      "The Associated Press spoke with more than a half-dozen FDA staffers who described long lines to park and clear security, followed by hours of hunting for space and supplies in offices that were not designed to accommodate the agency\u2019s full workforce. The staffers spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak with the media.",
      "One staffer described \u201cchaos and lost work hours\" for commuting, security lines and shuffled office space.",
      "About half the FDA\u2019s 20,000 scientists, attorneys, inspectors and support staff report to the agency\u2019s main campus in White Oak, Maryland, which until the late 1990s was a naval weapons testing facility.",
      "While many agencies switched to telework during the COVID-19 pandemic, the FDA began embracing the practice a decade earlier. Most employees had the option to work from home at least two days a week \u2014 flexibility that was seen as a competitive perk for recruiting highly trained experts who can often earn more working in industry.",
      "By 7:30 a.m., many on-campus parking lots were full, with cars parked along side streets, according to employees. Some workers reported waiting up to one hour to clear security checkpoints, and photos viewed by the AP showed lines of employees winding out doorways, along sidewalks and around corners.",
      "Once inside, employees confronted broken desks, missing chairs and locked offices for which they didn\u2019t have keys.",
      "\u201cAll of the staff is definitely bending over backwards to make an impossible situation work and get their work done,\u201d said one employee.",
      "Some employees were left to scour the campus for chairs and other essentials.",
      "\u201cPeople are looting chairs from conference rooms and other buildings,\u201d a staffer said. \u201cWe have no supplies. People are hunting around all of the buildings on campus for pads of paper and other basics.\u201d",
      "When employees did get situated, many shared cramped spaces with people from different divisions and teams, making it difficult to hold calls and meetings. Photos shared with the AP show folding chairs and tables setup in hallways and lobbies.",
      "An FDA spokesman said in an email Monday the agency \u201cis continuing its return-to-office activities to ensure staff remain able to conduct their important public health work.\u201d",
      "All the employees told the AP that they brought their own drinking water Monday. That\u2019s due to a monthslong issue involving Legionella, the bacteria that causes Legionnaires\u2019 disease, which was detected at several FDA buildings. The General Service Administration, which oversees federal buildings, has been working on the issue since last summer.",
      "FDA staff received an email earlier this month that all water is safe to drink, but it did not detail the latest testing results or corrective actions taken.",
      "Anthony Lee, who represents the local chapter of the federal union for FDA employees, said the agency has not granted the group's request for a meeting on the issue.",
      "Asked about the water, one staffer said: \u201cHonestly, none of us have tried it. After months of Legionella warnings, it\u2019s not very inviting.\"",

      "Aid agencies distributing U.S. food aid in Ethiopia's war-affected Tigray region say they have had to stop feeding millions of people because of the Trump administration's restrictions on foreign aid",
      "MEKELE, Ethiopia -- As a displaced person in Ethiopia\u2019s northern Tigray region, 76-year-old Haile Tsege is no stranger to hunger.",
      "During its war with Tigray fighters that devastated the region in 2020-2022, Ethiopian government restrictions on the rebellious region reduced aid flows to a trickle. Then in 2023, U.S. and U.N. aid distributions of grain were halted for months over a corruption scandal.",
      "Now the Trump administration\u2019s dismantling of the U.S. Agency for International Development, or USAID, has again halted food deliveries to a sprawling camp of over 20,000 people outside Tigray\u2019s regional capital, Mekele.",
      "\u201cWe will just die in silence,\u201d said Tsege, one of the 2.4 million people in Tigray who depend on humanitarian grain, most of it provided by the U.S.",
      "Ethiopia with its over 125 million people had been the biggest beneficiary of U.S. aid in sub-Saharan Africa, receiving $1.8 billion in the 2023 financial year. In addition to life-saving food, the funds were spent on HIV medications, vaccines, literacy programs and jobs creation, as well as services for 1 million refugees hosted by Ethiopia.",
      "Most of these programs have been stopped. The USAID staffers who oversaw them have been placed on administrative leave and told not to work, as they face the threat of termination. The U.S. Embassy didn't respond to questions.",
      "Emergency food was exempted from President Donald Trump\u2019s executive order, signed on his first day in office, suspending foreign aid during a 90-day review amid the administration's allegations of waste.",
      "Aid agencies in Ethiopia had to apply to USAID for waivers to continue handing out U.S. grain. These have been secured, but USAID\u2019s payments system is still not functioning.",
      "As a result, a consortium of aid agencies in Tigray has had to stop distributions to the over 1 million people it has been responsible for feeding with U.S.-provided grain. It has no money to pay for fuel, trucks and drivers to distribute existing food stockpiles.",
      "That includes 5,000 metric tons of sorghum \u2013 enough to feed 300,000 people for a month \u2013 stuck in a storage facility in Mekele that could rot before it reaches those in need.",
      "\u201cThis is just one warehouse. There are several others across the region,\u201d said Teklewoini Assefa, head of the Relief Society of Tigray, part of the consortium. \u201cThis will create malnutrition, disease. If this situation continues, what follows? Death.\u201d",
      "He added: \u201cEverything boils down to the payment system.\u201d",
      "The effects of the aid cuts are widespread, with many USAID contracts terminated. Already, Ethiopia has been forced to lay off 5,000 local healthcare workers who were working on its HIV response.",
      "Tigray relied heavily on U.S. funds. More than two years after the war killed hundreds of thousands, full-scale recovery efforts are yet to start. The region\u2019s health system is in ruins and hundreds of schools remain closed.",
      "In 2024, child malnutrition stood at 21% in some areas, according to a survey reviewed by The Associated Press \u2014 far above the World Health Organization\u2019s threshold of 15% at which a situation is classified as an emergency.",
      "Now, aid workers say many programs to improve nutrition have halted. Projects to deliver medicines and vaccines have stopped. Dozens of camps for displaced people have had water sources cut off.",
      "\u201cThe impact has been huge,\u201d said Ashenafi Asmelash, executive director of Mums for Mums, which has had two USAID- funded programs terminated. One helped build long-term resilience among farmers. The other helped improve the nutrition of children and new mothers.",
      "Management Sciences for Health, another Tigray organization, has halted a project to combat tuberculosis and told its staff to expect mass layoffs in March, according to a senior executive, who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisals.",
      "Efforts to assist thousands of women who were raped during the war have been derailed, said Rigat Bishaw at Ayder Hospital, Tigray\u2019s biggest healthcare facility.",
      "This includes counseling and physiotherapy sessions for survivors run by the U.S.-based Center for Victims of Torture, which received a stop-work order from the Trump administration in February and furloughed its staff.",
      "CVT also halted a program to train health workers to recognize sexual abuse cases and refer survivors to appropriate health services.",
      "\u201cThis sudden disruption is having a huge impact on the healing of traumatized people,\u201d said Yohannes Fisseha, a CVT manager.",
      "Major projects to support people living with HIV, improve access to life-saving nutrition services and improve relations between war-affected communities have also been cut off, said Yirga Gebregziabher, the Tigray branch manager of an Ethiopian organization called OSSHD, which helped implement the projects.",
      "The organization has been forced to fire dozens of expert staff.",
      "\u201cOur picture of America was as a protector of rights, a positive force in the world,\u201d Yigra said. \u201cThat image has now been broken. If there was a process, maybe the shock would have been less. But there was no consultation, no engagement.\u201d",

      "Jean Kaseya, director-general of the Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, or Africa CDC, told reporters that Friday\u2019s meeting with African health ministers will \u201cdiscuss recent developments in global health financing\u201d and where more sustainable funding might come from.",
      "Kaseya spoke of a \u201cnew era\u201d in health financing after U.S. aid cuts that have left health systems in Africa in disarray. The aid cuts, which affect governments and their partners in the non-governmental sector, have shut down or disrupted projects tackling diseases ranging from malaria to AIDS.",
      "Much of the funding to the Africa CDC and regional governments was lost with the Trump administration\u2019s decision to terminate most foreign aid contracts and cut $60 billion in overall U.S. assistance abroad. Many of the affected programs are in fragile countries that are highly reliant on U.S. aid to support health systems, nutrition programs and stave off starvation.",
      "Kaseya cited the immediate impact in Congo, which is the epicenter mpox outbreaks in Africa and where aid cuts and insecurity in the country\u2019s east have contributed to challenges in testing for the disease as well as securing enough vaccine doses.",
      "Aid cuts have impeded the collection and transportation of samples in Congo, Kaseya said.",
      "\u201cWe know this aid cut is a difficult moment for our countries, and it came overnight,\u201d he said. \u201cSome of them were not prepared for this major aid cut.\u201d",

      "\u201cWe are not just talking about the U.S.,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are saying almost all Western countries are decreasing their support. And that one is a critical issue for our health security.\u201d",

      "The Trump Administration's quest to \u201cMake America Health Again\u201d is targeting ultraprocessed foods",
      "In the Trump administration\u2019s quest to \u201cMake America Healthy Again,\u201d there may be no bigger target than ultraprocessed foods.",
      "Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the nation\u2019s new health secretary, has cited \u201chighly chemically processed foods\u201d as a chief culprit behind an epidemic of chronic disease in the U.S., including ailments such as obesity, diabetes and autoimmune disorders.",
      "Such foods are \u201cpoisoning\u201d people, particularly children, Kennedy said during Senate confirmation hearings. He has vowed to work to remove such foods from federal programs such as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP.",
      "\u201cI will do everything in my power to put the health of Americans back on track,\u201d he told lawmakers.",
      "Key to that goal, however, could be making sure that consumers understand basic facts about ultraprocessed foods and the role they play in daily meals.",
      "From sugary cereals at breakfast to frozen pizzas at dinner, plus in-between snacks of potato chips, sodas and ice cream, ultraprocessed foods make up about 60% of the U.S. diet. For kids and teens, it\u2019s even higher \u2014 about two-thirds of what they eat.",
      "That\u2019s concerning because ultraprocessed foods have been linked to a host of negative health effects, from obesity and diabetes to heart disease, depression, dementia and more. One recent study suggested that eating these foods may raise the risk of early death.",
      "Nutrition science is tricky, though, and most research so far has found connections, not proof, regarding the health consequences of these foods.",
      "Food manufacturers argue that processing boosts food safety and supplies and offers a cheap, convenient way to provide a diverse and nutritious diet.",
      "Even if the science were clear, it\u2019s hard to know what practical advice to give when ultraprocessed foods account for what one study estimates is more than 70% of the U.S. food supply.",
      "The Associated Press asked several nutrition experts and here\u2019s what they said:",
      "Most foods are processed, whether it\u2019s by freezing, grinding, fermentation, pasteurization or other means. In 2009, Brazilian epidemiologist Carlos Monteiro and colleagues first proposed a system that classifies foods according to the amount of processing they undergo, not by nutrient content.",
      "At the top of the four-tier scale are foods created through industrial processes and with ingredients such as additives, colors and preservatives that you couldn\u2019t duplicate in a home kitchen, said Kevin Hall, a researcher who focuses on metabolism and diet at the National Institutes of Health.",
      "\u201cThese are most, but not all, of the packaged foods you see,\u201d Hall said.",
      "Such foods are often made to be both cheap and irresistibly delicious, said Dr. Neena Prasad, director of the Bloomberg Philanthropies\u2019 Food Policy Program.",
      "\u201cThey have just the right combination of sugar, salt and fat and you just can\u2019t stop eating them,\u201d Prasad said",
      "However, the level of processing alone doesn\u2019t determine whether a food is unhealthy or not, Hall noted. Whole-grain bread, yogurt, tofu and infant formula are all highly processed, for instance, but they\u2019re also nutritious.",
      "Here\u2019s the tricky part. Many studies suggest that diets high in such foods are linked to negative health outcomes. But these kinds of studies can\u2019t say whether the foods themselves are the cause of the negative effects \u2014 or whether there\u2019s something else about the people who eat these foods that might be responsible.",
      "Ultraprocessed foods, as a group, tend to have higher amounts of sodium, saturated fat and sugar, and tend to be lower in fiber and protein. It\u2019s not clear whether it\u2019s just these nutrients that are driving the effects.",
      "Hall and his colleagues were the first to conduct a small but influential experiment that directly compared the results of eating similar diets made of ultraprocessed versus unprocessed foods.",
      "Published in 2019, the research included 20 adults who went to live at an NIH center for a month. They received diets of ultraprocessed and unprocessed foods matched for calories, sugar, fat, fiber and macronutrients for two weeks each and were told to eat as much as they liked.",
      "When participants ate the diet of ultraprocessed foods, they consumed about 500 calories per day more than when they ate unprocessed foods, researchers found \u2014 and they gained an average of about 2 pounds (1 kilogram) during the study period. When they ate only unprocessed foods for the same amount of time, they lost about 2 pounds (1 kilogram).",
      "Hall is conducting a more detailed study now, but the process is slow and costly and results aren\u2019t expected until late next year. He and others argue that such definitive research is needed to determine exactly how ultraprocessed foods affect consumption.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s better to understand the mechanisms by which they drive the deleterious health consequences, if they\u2019re driving them,\u201d he said.",
      "Some advocates, like Prasad, argue that the large body of research linking ultraprocessed foods to poor health should be more than enough to spur government and industry to change policies. She calls for actions such as increased taxes on sugary drinks, stricter sodium restrictions for manufacturers and cracking down on marketing of such foods to children.",
      "\u201cDo we want to risk our kids getting sicker while we wait for this perfect evidence to emerge?\u201d Prasad said.",
      "Last year, former FDA Commissioner Robert Califf broached the subject, telling a conference of food policy experts that ultraprocessed foods are \u201cone of the most complex things I\u2019ve ever dealt with.\u201d",
      "But, he concluded, \u201cWe\u2019ve got to have the scientific basis and then we\u2019ve got to follow through.\u201d",
      "In countries like the U.S., it\u2019s hard to avoid highly processed foods \u2014 and it's not clear which ones should be targeted, said Aviva Musicus, science director for the Center for Science in the Public Interest, which advocates for food policies.",
      "\u201cThe range of ultraprocessed foods is just so wide,\u201d she said.",
      "Instead, it\u2019s better to be mindful of the ingredients in foods. Check the labels and make choices that align with the current dietary guidelines, she suggested.",
      "\u201cWe have really good evidence that added sugar is not great for us. We have evidence that high-sodium foods are not great for us,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have great evidence that fruits and vegetables which are minimally processed are really good for us.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s important not to vilify certain foods, she added. Many consumers don\u2019t have the time or money to cook most meals from scratch.",
      "\u201cFoods should be joyous and delicious and shouldn\u2019t involve moral judgment,\u201d Musicus said.",

      "The 64-year-old was a respected heart surgeon who turned into a popular TV pitchman. Now he has his sights on overseeing health insurance for about 150 million Americans enrolled in Medicare, Medicaid or Affordable Care Act coverage.",
      "Republicans, who have coalesced around Trump's nominees for the health agencies, are likely to ask Oz about his plans for Medicare and Medicaid, including the Trump administration's focus on eliminating fraud from the $1 trillion programs.",
      "Democrats, meanwhile, will question Oz's tax filings, which they say show he has used a tax code loophole to underpay taxes by thousands of dollars on Medicare, the program he'll oversee. They will also grill Oz on any cuts he would make to the health insurance coverage as well as comments on his TV show supporting privatized Medicare.",
      "The U.S. Office of Government Ethics has done an \u201cextensive review\u201d of Oz's finances, spokesman Christopher Krepich said in a statement about Oz\u2019s taxes. He added that the office has indicated \u201cany potential conflicts have been resolved and he is in compliance with the law.\u201d",
      "Oz has hawked everything from supplements to private health insurance plans on his former TV series, \u201cThe Dr. Oz Show,\u201d which ran for 13 seasons and helped him amass a fortune.",
      "Oz\u2019s net worth is between $98 million and $332 million, according to an analysis of the disclosure, which lists asset values in ranges but does not give precise dollar figures. His most recent disclosure shows he also holds millions of dollars worth of shares in health insurance, fertility, pharmaceutical and vitamin companies. He has promised to divest from dozens of companies that would pose conflicts for him as the CMS administrator.",
      "In the job, he could wield significant power over most health companies operating in the U.S. because he can make decisions about who and what are covered by Medicare and Medicaid.",
      "Oz's hearing comes as the Trump administration seeks to finalize leadership posts for the nation\u2019s top health agencies. On Thursday, Senate committees voted to advance the nominations of Marty Makary, poised to lead the Food and Drug Administration, and Jay Bhattacharya, set to helm the National Institutes for Health, for a full Senate vote. The nomination of Dave Weldon to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention was abruptly withdrawn Thursday.",
      "Those men have all leaned into Robert F. Kennedy Jr. 's call to \u201cMake America Healthy Again,\u201d a controversial effort to redesign the nation's food supply, reject vaccine mandates and cast doubt on some long-established scientific research.",
      "\u201cAmericans need better research on healthy lifestyle choices from unbiased scientists,\u201d Oz wrote late last year in a social media post praising Kennedy's nomination to be the nation's health secretary.",
      "This isn't Oz's first time testifying before senators. In 2014, several senators scolded him during a hearing about the questionable weight loss products he hawked on his television show.",

      "New Mexico has paired up with the Alzheimer\u2019s Association in a pilot U.S. initiative aimed at raising awareness about a disease that affects several million people in the country",
      "ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. -- New Mexico has paired up with the Alzheimer's Association in a pilot U.S. initiative aimed at raising awareness about a disease that affects several million people across the nation, including family members and friends who often provide countless hours of unpaid care.",
      "The joint campaign \u2014 a year in the making \u2014 features billboards, digital ads and social media posts. It was unveiled Wednesday, days after authorities confirmed that actor Gene Hackman died at his Santa Fe home of heart disease with complications from Alzheimer\u2019s disease.",
      "Hackman, like the majority of people with Alzheimer\u2019s and related dementias, lived at home. His wife, Betsy Arakawa, was his caregiver but died from hantavirus, a rare, rodent-borne disease. Experts believe Hackman, in the advanced stages of Alzheimer's, was unable to seek help.",
      "The goal of the new partnership between the state and the Alzheimer's Association is to spark conversations within families and to educate the public on warning signs and treatments. It also aims to publicize support services for family members and other caregivers.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s kind of the whole point of the campaign \u2014 to start talking, to start thinking, to take some action,\u201d said Joey Long, a spokesperson with the state Aging and Long-Term Services Department. \u201cSo it's like, maybe they\u2019ve been confused. Well, let\u2019s talk about what that means.\u201d",
      "According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, more than 7 million people are living with the disease in the U.S., where Alzheimer\u2019s is the seventh-leading cause of death. In New Mexico, estimates put the number of people with the disease at 46,000, with another 67,000 family members providing care at home within the last year.",
      "Alzheimer's kills more people in the U.S. than breast cancer and prostate cancer combined, according to statistics shared by the Alzheimer's Association, which is helping to fund research projects in dozens of countries around the world.",
      "One of the challenges is that only about half of the people who are living with the disease are ever diagnosed, said Jim Herlihy, a spokesperson for the association's Rocky Mountain region. The number of undiagnosed people is higher in communities of color, he said.",
      "Neurologists say it can take 20 years from the start of the disease taking shape in the brain to when it becomes recognizable and diagnosed, what Herlihy describes as a glacial pace.",
      "\u201cPeople think of this as either an old person\u2019s disease or something that happens to somebody else,\u201d Herlihy said. \u201cAnd unless it\u2019s happened in your family and you have seen a loved one decline from this disease, or you have been put into the role of being a caregiver, you don\u2019t realize the impact that this has.\u201d",
      "The nonprofit association published a special report last year detailing the importance of families mapping out a plan for care, acknowledging that it can be a complex maze involving social services, medications and specialists.",
      "The billboards and ads are simple. One of them pictures a caution sign in the road that reads: \u201cHoney, you've been confused.\u201d The messages urge people to talk about it and to visit a website that includes a hotline for those who don't know where to start.",
      "A significant percentage of New Mexico's population is aging, which has spurred officials to find ways to educate and prepare state residents. In addition to the awareness campaign, the state is planning a series of community forums on the subject this spring in rural areas with high rates of the disease.",
      "The Alzheimer's Association is hoping the campaign will expand to other states.",

    "story": [
      "President Trump's nominee to head the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is getting ready to appear before Congress",
      "NEW YORK -- Dr. David Weldon had been out of the national spotlight for more than 15 years when he was nominated to head the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. But many anti-vaccine advocates knew him well.",
      "\u201cHe is one of us!! Since before our movement had momentum,\u201d the co-director of Mississippi Parents for Vaccine Rights wrote on Facebook. And on X, formerly known as Twitter, the Autism Action Network credited the former congressman with introducing legislation two decades ago \u201cto stop the vaccine pedocide.\u201d",
      "Weldon, who was nominated by President Donald Trump, needs to be confirmed by the U.S. Senate before he can lead the nation\u2019s top public health agency. His confirmation hearing is to be held Thursday.",
      "The 71-year-old retired Florida congressman is considered to be closely aligned with his presumptive boss, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the U.S. health secretary who for years has been one of the nation's leading anti-vaccine activists.",
      "Department of Health and Human Services officials declined to make Weldon or Kennedy available for an Associated Press interview.",
      "When he made the nomination announcement, Trump said Weldon \u201cwill proudly restore the CDC to its true purpose, and will work to end the Chronic Disease Epidemic, and Make America Healthy Again!\u201d",
      "The CDC was created nearly 80 years ago to prevent the spread of malaria in the U.S. Its mission was later expanded, and it gradually became a global leader on infectious and chronic diseases and a go-to source of health information.",
      "Today, the Atlanta-based agency has a more than $9 billion core budget. It had about 13,000 employees when Trump took office, but more than 500 were fired as part of a dramatic \u2014 and continuing \u2014 push by the president and his billionaire adviser Elon Musk to cut staffing across federal agencies.",
      "Weldon has no experience in federal public heath, but that isn't unusual. The last few presidential administrations \u2014 both Democratic and Republican \u2014 have appointed outsiders with no CDC experience.",
      "Unlike Weldon, however, those outsiders had been public health researchers or had run state health departments. He is an Army veteran and internal medicine doctor whose main claim to fame was representing a central Florida district in Congress from 1995 to 2009.",
      "After he left Congress, Weldon practiced medicine in Florida, taught at the Florida Institute of Technology, served as board chairman for the Israel Allies Foundation and made unsuccessful runs at federal and state elected office. In a March 1 letter to HHS, Weldon said that if confirmed he will resign from the foundation and from two Florida health-care organizations. He also promised to sell his holdings in funds investing in energy, pharmaceutical and health-care companies.",
      "Weldon was a leader of a Congressional push for research into autism\u2019s causes, which began around 2000. It was fueled by a controversial \u2014 and ultimately discredited \u2014 study by British researcher Dr. Andrew Wakefield that claimed to find a link between the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine and autism.",
      "The action in Congress was driven largely by U.S. Rep. Dan Burton, an Indiana Republican whose grandson had autism. Weldon was a prominent voice in Burton\u2019s hearings and co-sponsored a bill that would give responsibility for the nation\u2019s vaccine safety to an independent agency within HHS \u2014 an idea that not everyone in public health opposes.",
      "But Weldon also rejected studies that found no causal link between childhood vaccines and autism, and accused the CDC of short-circuiting research that might show otherwise.",
      "Meanwhile, Weldon was a friend to practitioners of fringe medicine. When Weldon invited Wakefield to testify before Congress, he also brought in Dr. James \u201cJeff\u201d Bradstreet, who used alternative medicine to try to treat autistic children. Bradstreet died in 2015, after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration raided his office, of a gunshot wound that police labeled a suicide.",
      "Weldon later appeared in \u201cVaxxed: From Cover-Up to Catastrophe,\u201d a 2016 documentary directed by Wakefield and produced by Del Bigtree, an activist who later became the manager of Kennedy\u2019s 2024 presidential campaign. In the movie, Weldon repeated suspicions and accusations about CDC that he\u2019d made as a congressman.",
      "Kennedy has argued that experts who advise the CDC on vaccine policy have conflicts from working with, or receiving money from, pharmaceutical companies. Those advisers routinely disclose conflicts in public meetings, but the CDC last week launched a web tool \u201cto increase the transparency of conflicts of interest.\u201d",
      "At Thursday's hearing, Democrats are likely to press Weldon on his vaccine views and his plans for the agency under a health secretary who has shown disdain for it.",
      "Dr. Anne Schuchat worked at the CDC for 33 years before retiring in 2021, and twice served as acting director. She said she doesn\u2019t know Weldon, but that agency directors gradually develop an appreciation and respect for its work.",
      "If Weldon follows a similar pattern, she said, he could be a great asset: His Capitol Hill experience could help CDC secure funding and political support.",
      "\u201cWith an optimistic view, there\u2019s lot you can build on, with what he has on paper,\u201d she said. \u201cWith a pessimistic view, if he wants the job to tear the place down, that would be disappointing \u2014 and dangerous.\u201d",

      "HONG KONG -- Hong Kong's leader has waded into a controversy over a prominent conglomerate\u2019s decision to sell its Panama Canal port assets to a consortium including American investment bank BlackRock Inc., a deal that has angered Beijing and highlights how escalating tensions between Beijing and Washington can leave the Chinese financial center\u2019s business leaders trapped in the middle.",
      "Chief Executive John Lee told reporters at a weekly news briefing that CK Hutchison Holdings' in-principle agreement to sell its controlling stake in a company operating ports at both ends of the Panama Canal was being discussed extensively and concerns raised about the deal deserve serious attention. He did not specify what the concerns were.",
      "\u201c(The) government urges foreign governments to provide a fair and just environment for enterprises,\u201d he said. \u201cWe oppose the abusive use of coercion or bullying tactics in international economic and trade relations.\u201d",
      "Lee avoided a direct mention of U.S. President Donald Trump and also stopped short of criticizing CK Hutchison or tycoon Li Ka-shing's family, which owns a controlling stake in the conglomerate.",
      "His comments followed a somewhat veiled backlash from Beijing.",
      "Since last Thursday, Beijing\u2019s offices handling Hong Kong affairs have reposted two commentaries by a Beijing-backed local newspaper that blasted the deal. That has raised questions over the sale.",
      "One of the newspaper commentaries suggested the deal is a betrayal to all Chinese and disregards national interests. The other described great entrepreneurs as patriots, but suggested that businesspeople who \u201cdance with\u201d predatory American politicians to reap quick profits were doomed to infamy.",
      "The articles signaled Beijing\u2019s disapproval of the deal, though its actual impact remains unclear.",
      "Posting of the articles has been seen as an indirect attack on the conglomerate by Chinese leaders. Trump, who has alleged Chinese interference with the operations of the critical shipping lane, hailed the deal, saying his administration would \u201creclaim\u201d the Panama Canal. Panama President Jos\u00e9 Ra\u00fal Mulino accused him of lying.",
      "Lee said any business transaction must comply with Hong Kong's laws. The city will handle it according to the law, he said without elaborating.",
      "Increasing influence from Beijing is adding to pressure on business leaders in the former British colony, that was returned to Chinese rule in 1997.",
      "CK Hutchison did not comment on Lee\u2019s remarks or the articles. It was due to report its 2024 financial results on Thursday, but said it did not plan a news conference.",
      "The company surprised market watchers when it announced March 4 that it would sell all shares in Hutchison Port Holdings and in Hutchison Port Group Holdings to the consortium in a deal valued at nearly $23 billion, including $5 billion in debt. Hutchison said the transaction was purely commercial and unrelated to other developments surrounding the Panama Ports.",
      "The deal, if approved, will give the BlackRock consortium control over 43 ports in 23 countries, including the ports of Balboa and Cristobal, located at either end of the Panama Canal. Other ports are in Mexico, the Netherlands, Egypt, Australia, Pakistan and elsewhere.",
      "The transaction requires approval by Panama\u2019s government. It does not affect a trust that operates ports in Hong Kong or any other ports in mainland China.",
      "Panama says it has full control over the shipping lane and Hutchison's operation of the ports does not amount to Chinese control over the canal. Selling it to a U.S.-based company does not represent any U.S. \u201creclaiming\u201d of the canal, it says.",
      "The United States built the canal in the early 1900s, seeking a faster way for commercial and military vessels to travel between its coasts. Washington relinquished control of the waterway to Panama on Dec. 31, 1999, under a treaty signed in 1977 by then-President Jimmy Carter. Trump has claimed that Carter \u201cfoolishly\u201d gave the canal away.",
      "Some 70% of the sea traffic that crosses the Panama Canal leaves or goes to U.S. ports.",

      "Jhoan Bastidas is just starting to make sense of it all",
      "MARACAIBO, Venezuela -- Jhoan Bastidas was deported from the United States and spent 16 days at the U.S. naval base in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, watched by cameras and eating small meals that left him hungry.",
      "\u201cI was locked up all day in a little room \u2014 I counted the feet: 7 wide and 13 long \u2014 without being able to do anything, without a book, looking at the walls,\u201d Bastidas, 25, said in his father\u2019s middle-class home in the western city of Maracaibo, Venezuela.",
      "Three weeks after he was returned to Venezuela under President Donald Trump\u2019s immigration crackdown, Bastidas is just starting to make sense of it all \u2014 how he is back in the once-prosperous hometown that he left as a teenager; how tattoos on his chest earned him a reputation as a criminal; and how he became one of the few migrants to set foot on the naval base best known for housing terrorism suspects.",
      "Bastidas and roughly 350 other Venezuelans who migrated to the U.S. are trying to piece their lives together after they were deported to their troubled country over the past few weeks. About 180 of them spent up to 16 days at the base in Guantanamo before being flown to Honduras by U.S. authorities and, from there, to Venezuela by the government of President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro.",
      "It is part of the White House\u2019s efforts to deport a record number of immigrants in the U.S. illegally. Trump\u2019s government has alleged Venezuelans sent to the naval base are members of the Tren de Aragua gang, which originated in the South American country, but it has offered little evidence to back that up.",
      "\u201cIt was all very hard; all those experiences were very hard,\u201d Bastidas said.\u202f\u201cYou have to be strong in the face of all those problems, you know, but I saw so much hate.\u201d",
      "More than 7.7 million Venezuelans have left their homeland since 2013, when its oil-dependent economy came undone and Maduro became president. Most settled in Latin America and the Caribbean, but after the COVID-19 pandemic, they increasingly set their sights on the U.S.",
      "Venezuela has refused to take back its own citizens from the U.S. for years, with brief, limited exceptions such as the recent flights.",
      "Over the weekend, the U.S. government transferred hundreds of immigrants to a maximum-security prison in El Salvador after Trump invoked an 18th century wartime law to speed up deportations of alleged Tren de Aragua members. The Trump administration, however, has not provided any evidence to back up the gang-membership claim.",
      "The immigrants were transferred even as a federal judge issued an order temporarily barring deportations under the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, which allows the president broader leeway on policy and executive action to expedite mass deportations.",
      "Bastidas, his mother and siblings left Maracaibo in 2018, one of the harshest years of the country\u2019s protracted crisis. As they tested their luck in Peru and then settled in Colombia, people living in Venezuela lost jobs, formed long lines outside near-empty grocery stores and went hungry.",
      "Their hometown saw businesses shutter and entire families sell their belongings and move away. The hourslong power outages that became everyday occurrences starting in 2019 pushed even more people to abandon Maracaibo.",
      "He set off for Texas in November 2023, bankrolled by a brother whose promise of a car and a food delivery job in Utah convinced him to migrate.",
      "Bastidas turned himself in to U.S. authorities after reaching the border with Mexico and was taken to a detention facility in El Paso, Texas. He remained there until early February, when one morning he was handcuffed, driven to an airport and put in an airplane without being told where it was headed.",
      "After the aircraft landed, fellow passengers thought they were in Venezuela, but when he reached the door and only saw \u201cgringos,\u201d Bastidas said, he concluded they were wrong. When he saw \u201cGuantanamo\u201d written on the floor, it did not mean anything to him. He had never heard that word before.",
      "When inside the cell, Bastidas said, he could never tell the time of day because its only window was a small glass panel at the top of the door looking into the building. He said he only saw sunlight every three days for an hour, which was the recreation time he was allowed to spend in what he described as a \u201ccage.\u201d",
      "Bastidas said his hands and feet were shackled whenever he left his cell, including when he went to shower every three days.\u202f At one point, he and other detainees were given small Bibles, and they began praying together, reading Scripture loudly and placing their ears against the door to hear each other.",
      "\u201cWe used to say that the one who was going to get us out was God because we didn\u2019t see any other solutions. We didn\u2019t have anyone to lean on,\u201d Bastidas added.",
      "The U.S. Department of Homeland Security did not respond\u202fto requests for comment.",
      "Trump has said he planned\u202f to send \u201cthe worst\" to the base in Cuba, including members of the Tren de Aragua. Bastidas said he is not part of the gang and believes the U.S. authorities used his tattoos to wrongly catalog him as a member of the criminal organization.",
      "When asked which tattoos he thinks authorities misjudged, his father pulled down the neck of Bastidas\u2019 white T-shirt and pointed to two black, eight-pointed stars, each inked on one side of the chest, below the collarbones.",
      "The American Civil Liberties Union has filed a lawsuit attempting to block further transfers to Guantanamo alleging cruelty by the guards and suicide attempts by at least three people held there.",
      "Bastidas and other Venezuelans returned to Venezuela from Guantanamo on Feb. 20. Armed state intelligence service agents dropped them off at their homes.",
      "Bastidas spent the next two weeks resting. He then began working at a hot dog stand.",
      "Abandoned storefronts and homes are everywhere in Maracaibo, which once was a magnet for immigrants looking for good-paying jobs in and around nearby oil fields. But corruption, mismanagement and eventual U.S. economic sanctions saw production \u2014 and population \u2014 decline steadily.",
      "Few people might know Bastidas by name in his sweltering hometown, but practically everyone in Maracaibo knows someone who has migrated. So, news of the Venezuelans\u2019 transfer to Guantanamo was shared seemingly endlessly on social media and WhatsApp, setting off debates over their living conditions and alleged gang affiliations as well as the complex crisis that drove them to migrate in the first place.",
      "Bastidas is leaning into faith to ignore the noise and move forward.",
      "\u201cI see it as a kind of test that the Lord put me through,\u201d he said. \u201cHe has another purpose for me. It wasn\u2019t for me to be (in the U.S.), and he kept me there (in detention) for some reason.\u201d",

      "TBILISI, Georgia -- A court in Georgia on Monday handed another prison sentence to former President Mikheil Saakashvili, extending his total imprisonment to 12\u00bd years, in a verdict that he denounced as illegal.",
      "Saakashvili, who served as Georgia\u2019s president from 2004-2013, had previously been sentenced on charges of abuse of power and embezzlement that he and his defense have rejected as politically motivated.",
      "On Monday, the court sentenced him to four years and six months on charges of illegal border crossing. With his previous sentences accumulated, he now has to serve 12 years and six months behind bars.",
      "Saakashvili, speaking by videoconference, dismissed Monday's verdict as an \u201cabsolutely illegal, unjust sentencing of me for crimes I have not committed.\u201d",
      "\u201cThey want to annihilate me in prison,\u201d he said. \"But no matter what, I will fight till the end.\u201d",
      "Saakashvili, who led the so-called Rose Revolution protests in 2003 that drove his predecessor out of office, enacted a serious of ambitious reforms tacking official corruption as president of the South Caucasus nation of 3.7 million. He also presided over a short but fierce war with Russia in 2008 that ended with the humiliating loss of its last footholds in two separatist territories, and he cracked down on protesters who charged that his zeal had mutated into autocracy.",
      "In 2012, Saakashvili\u2019s United National Movement party lost the election to the Georgian Dream party established by Bidzina Ivanishvili, a shadowy billionaire who made his fortune in Russia. Georgian Dream has remained in power ever since, tightening its grip on democratic freedoms and drawing accusations from the opposition of steering the country away from the path toward European Union membership and back into Russia\u2019s sphere of influence.",
      "Saakashvili left for Ukraine in 2013, obtained Ukrainian citizenship and served as a governor of the country\u2019s southern Odesa region from 2015-16. He returned to Georgia in October 2021 to try to bolster opposition forces before nationwide municipal elections and was quickly arrested.",
      "The former president spent much of his time behind bars in a prison hospital after going on a hunger strikes and later claiming that he had been poisoned. He is currently receiving medical treatment at the Vivamedi Clinic, where he is being monitored for several chronic conditions, and his health reportedly worsens periodically, according to the clinic.",
      "Saakashvili's lawyer, Beka Basilaia, said that Monday's verdict again showed that Saakashvili is a political prisoner.",
      "\"As long as Georgian Dream remains in power, the judiciary is a farce and will make whatever decision it is instructed to,\u201d Basilaia said.",

      "Britain\u2019s foreign intelligence agency launched a search for its next chief on Tuesday, and the current officeholder has suggested he\u2019d like his replacement to be a woman. Although Judi Dench played M, the fictional head of MI6, in seven Bond thrillers starting in the 1990s, the real-life agency has not had a woman chief in its 116-year history.",

Anne Keast-Butler became head of electronic and cyber-intelligence agency GCHQ in 2023.",
      "Moore, an Oxford-educated former diplomat, fits the 007 mold like a Savile Row suit. But in recent years MI6 has worked to shed its image as the least diverse of the agencies, broadening its recruitment process from the traditional \u201ctap on the shoulder\u201d at an elite university.",
      "The agency\u2019s website stresses its family-friendly flexible working policy and goal of recruiting \u201ctalented people from all backgrounds.\u201d",
      "In 2021, Moore apologized on behalf of MI6 for its treatment of LGBT staff and aspiring agents who were fired or denied jobs because of their sexuality. Gay people were barred from working for the agency until 1991.",

But we men, as allies, can help our female colleagues achieve the success their talent deserves. We have yet to have a woman as Chief so there\u2019s still a glass ceiling to shatter.\u201d",
      "Moore, appointed in 2020, has led MI6 through the COVID pandemic, Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine and the Israel-Hamas war. He has opened the secretive agency ever-so-slightly to media scrutiny, making public speeches and embracing social media.",
      "Like many things about MI6, also known as the Secret Intelligence Service, the process of choosing Moore\u2019s replacement takes place out of public view. It began with the country\u2019s top civil servant, Cabinet Secretary Chris Wormald, writing to government departments on Tuesday asking them to put forward candidates.",
      "Applicants may come from among three MI6 directors-general who report to Moore, all of whom are women. That includes the agency\u2019s head of operations and its technology chief \u2013 the real-life equivalent of Bond gadget-master Q.",
      "Applicants also could come from other intelligence agencies, the civil service, the diplomatic service, the armed forces or the police.",
      "An announcement of the choice is likely in the summer, with the new chief taking up their post in the fall.",

      "Germany\u2019s would-be next chancellor, Friedrich Merz, is asking lawmakers to allow the country to put \u201cwhatever it takes\u201d into defense and to authorize an enormous fund for investment in its creaking infrastructure",
      "BERLIN -- Germany's would-be next chancellor, Friedrich Merz, asked lawmakers Tuesday to loosen the nation's strict debt rules to enable higher defense spending as doubts mount about the strength of the trans-Atlantic alliance, and to authorize an enormous fund for investment in its creaking infrastructure, financed by large-scale borrowing.",
      "Merz faced a major test in the outgoing parliament, which met for a final time to vote on the plans as his center-right Union bloc works to put together a governing coalition with the center-left Social Democrats of outgoing Chancellor Olaf Scholz after winning last month's election.",
      "The plans need a two-thirds majority in parliament's lower house, the Bundestag, because they involve changes to Germany's strict self-imposed borrowing rules \u2014 the so-called \u201cdebt brake,\u201d which allows new borrowing worth only 0.35% of annual gross domestic product and is anchored in the constitution. That forced the prospective coalition partners into negotiations with the environmentalist Greens, whose votes will be needed to get enough support.",
      "The package would exempt from the debt rules spending on defense and security, including intelligence agencies and assistance to Ukraine, of more than 1% of GDP. It also foresees setting up a 500 billion-euro ($544 billion) fund, financed by borrowing, to pour funding into Germany's infrastructure over the next 12 years and help restore the stagnant economy \u2014 Europe's biggest \u2014 to growth.",
      "At the Greens' insistence, 100 billion euros from the investment fund will go into climate-related spending.",
      "The plans amount to an about-turn for Merz, whose party had spoken out against running up new debt before the election without entirely closing the door to future changes to the \u201cdebt brake.\u201d The Social Democrats and Greens had long argued for a reform of the borrowing rules.",
      "Recent weeks have brought new urgency to efforts to further strengthen Germany's long-neglected military. The outgoing government created a special 100 billion-euro fund to modernize it, which also helped Berlin meet the current NATO target of spending 2% of GDP on defense. But that pot will be used up in 2027, and doubts have grown recently about the Trump administration's commitment to European allies.",
      "Merz said earlier this month that Germany and Europe must quickly strengthen their defense capability and that \u201c\u2018whatever it takes\u2019 must also go for our defense now.\"",
      "On Tuesday, he pointed to the danger from Russian President Vladimir \u201cPutin's war of aggression against Europe \u2014 it is a war against Europe and not just a war against Ukraine's territorial integrity.\u201d He pointed to suspected Russian sabotage and disinformation in Europe.",
      "Merz said the prospective German government's move should be \u201cthe first step toward a new European defense community,\u201d which could include countries outside the European Union such as Britain and Norway.",
      "He acknowledged that many are struggling to digest the wider spending plans but argued that \u201cthey open prospects for our country that, in the times we are living in, are urgently needed.\u201d",
      "The package was brought to the old parliament \u2014 not the newly elected one, which will hold its first session March 25 \u2014 because parties that were unlikely to agree have just over one-third of the seats in the new chamber. The far-right Alternative for Germany portrays itself as a staunch defender of the \u201cdebt brake,\u201d while the Left Party opposes it but is skeptical about military spending.",
      "\u201cA politician's greatest asset is credibility and with this embarrassing action, dear Mr. Merz, you have already squandered yours completely,\u201d Alternative for Germany co-leader Tino Chrupalla said. \u201cVoters feel cheated by you, and rightly.\u201d",
      "In the outgoing Bundestag, the Union, Social Democrats and Greens have a combined 520 of the 733 lawmakers \u2014 31 more than are required for a two-thirds majority.",
      "If the package is approved Tuesday, it faces another hurdle Friday in parliament's upper house, which represents Germany's 16 state governments. They are also set to be given more freedom to borrow money.",
      "A two-thirds majority will also be needed in the upper house. That initially was uncertain because the parties behind the plans control only 41 of the 69 upper-house votes. But on Monday, the conservative-led governing coalition in Bavaria, which has six votes, also agreed to support the package.",

      "Lawyers for convicted baby killer Lucy Letby and former executives at the hospital where she worked have asked a judge to halt an inquiry into the deaths after a panel of medical experts found no evidence of a crime",
      "LONDON -- Lawyers for convicted baby killer Lucy Letby and former executives at the hospital where she worked have asked to halt an inquiry into the deaths after a panel of medical experts found no evidence of a crime, a judge said Monday.",
      "Justice Kathryn Thirlwall announced the requests before hearing closing statements in the inquiry that began in September seeking accountability for staff and management for the harm to babies at Countess of Chester Hospital in northwest England.",
      "The inquiry was predicated on Letby's guilt, and Thirlwall had said she would not review the convictions after an appeals court upheld them. But lawyers for Letby said that if the convictions are overturned, the inquiry might reach the wrong conclusions, and 10 million pounds ($13 million) spent so far will have been a waste of taxpayer funds.",
      "\u201cIn short, it will defeat the purpose of a public inquiry, to fully and fearlessly understand the circumstances in which the babies died or became unwell,\" attorney Louise Mortimer wrote in a letter to Thirlwall.",
      "Thirlwall is expected to publish a final report in the fall.",
      "Letby, 35, is serving multiple life sentences with no chance of release after being convicted of seven counts of murder and attempting to murder seven other infants while working as a neonatal nurse at the hospital between June 2015 and June 2016.",
      "Prosecutors said Letby left little or no trace when she harmed babies: injecting air into their bloodstreams, administering air or milk into their stomachs via nasogastric tubes, interfering with breathing tubes or poisoning them with insulin. They said she was the only employee on duty in the neonatal unit when the children collapsed or died.",
      "But a group of 16 international medical experts in pediatrics and neonatology who reviewed the medical evidence concluded that natural causes or bad medical care led to the death or collapse of each newborn, Dr. Shoo Lee, a retired neonatologist from Canada, said last month.",
      "The panel also questioned the premise that there was an unexplained spike in deaths at the hospital. It said evidence of schedules that showed Letby was present during all the deaths was \u201cincomplete, selective and, therefore, meaningless.\"",
      "Letby\u2019s convictions are being examined by the Criminal Case Review Commission, which looks at potential miscarriages of justice. It could refer its findings to the Court of Appeal.",
      "Former executives at the hospital \u2014 chief executive Tony Chambers, medical director Ian Harvey, director of nursing Alison Kelly and human resources director Sue Hodkinson \u2014 asked for the public inquiry to be halted after the medical panel released its findings.",
      "The Crown Prosecution Service has said two juries convicted Letby and three appellate judges had rejected her arguments that the prosecution expert evidence was flawed.",
      "Several related investigations remain active.",
      "Cheshire police announced last week that its investigation into corporate manslaughter at the hospital had been expanded and was now looking at individual suspects for gross negligence manslaughter.",
      "Letby's lawyer criticized that decision, based on the medical panel's findings.",
      "\u201cWe now have substantial and significant expert evidence which completely demolishes the prosecution case against Lucy Letby and points the finger in a very different direction to that which the police are currently looking,\u201d Mark McDonald said. \"It is time they take a step back and ask themselves whether have they made a huge mistake.\u201d",
      "A separate investigation is looking into other deaths and near-deaths of babies at the Countess of Chester Hospital and the Liverpool Women\u2019s Hospital when Letby worked there between 2012 to 2016.",

      "MEXICO CITY -- The videos roll through TikTok in 30-second flashes.",
      "Migrants trek in camouflage through dry desert terrain. Dune buggies roar up to the United States-Mexico border barrier. Families with young children pass through gaps in the wall. Helicopters, planes, yachts, tunnels and jet skis stand by for potential customers.",
      "Laced with emojis, the videos posted by smugglers offer a simple promise: If you don\u2019t have a visa in the U.S., trust us. We\u2019ll get you over safely.",
      "At a time when legal pathways to the U.S. have been slashed and criminal groups are raking in money from migrant smuggling, social media apps like TikTok have become an essential tool for smugglers and migrants alike. The videos \u2014 taken to cartoonish extremes \u2014 offer a rare look inside a long elusive industry and the narratives used by trafficking networks to fuel migration north.",
      "\u201cWith God\u2019s help, we\u2019re going to continue working to fulfill the dreams of foreigners. Safe travels without robbing our people,\u201d wrote one enterprising smuggler.",
      "As President Donald Trump begins to ramp up a crackdown at the border and migration levels to the U.S. dip, smugglers say new technologies allow networks to be more agile in the face of challenges, and expand their reach to new customers \u2014 a far cry from the old days when each village had its trusted smuggler.",
      "\u201cIn this line of work, you have to switch tactics,\u201d said a woman named Soary, part of a smuggling network bringing migrants from Ciudad Juarez to El Paso, Texas, who spoke to The Associated Press on the condition that her last name would not be shared out of concern that authorities would track her down. \u201cTikTok goes all over the world.\"",
      "Soary, 24, began working in smuggling when she was 19, living in El Paso, where she was approached by a friend about a job. She would use her truck to pick up migrants who had recently jumped the border. Despite the risks involved with working with trafficking organizations, she said it earned her more as a single mother than her previous job putting in hair extensions.",
      "As she gained more contacts on both sides of the border, she began connecting people from across the Americas with a network of smugglers to sneak them across borders and eventually into the U.S.",
      "Like many smugglers, she would take videos of migrants speaking to the camera after crossing the border to send over WhatsApp as evidence to loved ones that her clients had gotten to their destination safely. Now she posts those clips to TikTok.",
      "TikTok says the platform strictly prohibits human smuggling and reports such content to law enforcement.",
      "The use of social media to facilitate migration took off around 2017 and 2018, when activists built massive WhatsApp groups to coordinate the first major migrant caravans traveling from Central America to the U.S., according to Guadalupe Correa-Cabrera, a professor at George Mason University focused on the migrant smuggling industry.",
      "Later, smugglers began to infiltrate those chats and use the choice social media app of the day, expanding to Facebook and Instagram.",
      "Migrants, too, began to document their often perilous voyages north, posting videos trekking through the jungles of the Darien Gap dividing Colombia and Panama, and after being released by extorting cartels.",
      "A 2023 study by the United Nations reported that 64% of the migrants they interviewed had access to a smart phone and the internet during their migration to the U.S.",
      "Around the time of the study's release, as use of the app began to soar, that Correa-Cabrera said she began to see smuggling ads skyrocket on TikTok.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a marketing strategy,\u201d Correa-Cabrera said. \u201cEveryone was on TikTok, particularly after the pandemic, and then it began to multiply.\u201d",
      "Last year, Soary, the smuggler, said she began to publish videos of migrants and families in the U.S. with their faces covered and photos of the U.S.-Mexico border with messages like: \u201cWe\u2019ll pass you through Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez, no matter where you are. Fence jumping, treks and by tunnel. Adults, children and the elderly.\u201d",
      "Hundreds of videos examined by the AP feature thick wads of cash, people crossing through the border fence by night, helicopters and airplanes supposedly used by coyotes, smugglers cutting open cacti in the desert for migrants to drink from and even crops of lettuce with text reading \u201cThe American fields are ready!\u201d",
      "The videos are often layered over heavy northern Mexican music with lyrics waxing romantically about being traffickers. Videos are published by accounts with names alluding to \u201csafe crossing,\u201d \u201cUSA destinations,\u201d \u201cfulfilling dreams\u201d or \u201cpolleros,\u201d as smugglers are often called.",
      "Narratives shift based on the political environment and immigration policies in the U.S. During the Biden administration, posts would advertise getting migrants access to asylum applications through the administration's CBP One app, which Trump ended.",
      "Amid Trump's crackdown, posts have shifted to dispelling fears that migrants will be captured, promising American authorities have been paid off. Smugglers openly taunt U.S. authorities: one shows himself smoking what appears to be marijuana right in front of the border wall; another even takes a jab at Trump, referring to the president as a \u201chigh-strung gringo.\u201d",
      "Comments are dotted with emojis of flags and baby chickens, a symbol meaning migrant among smugglers, and other users asking for prices and more information.",
      "Cristina, who migrated because she struggled make ends meet in the Mexican state of Zacatecas, was among those scrolling in December after the person she had hired to smuggle her to the U.S. abandoned her and her partner in Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez.",
      "\u201cIn a moment of desperation, I started searching on TikTok and, well, with the algorithm videos began to pop up,\u201d she said. \u201cIt took me a half an hour\u201d to find a smuggler.",
      "After connecting, smugglers and migrants often negotiate on encrypted apps like WhatsApp and Telegram, doing a careful dance to gain each other's trust. Cristina, now living in Phoenix, said she decided to trust Soary because she was a woman and posted videos of families, something the smuggler admitted was a tactic to gain migrants' trust.",
      "Smugglers, migrants and authorities warn that such videos have been used to scam migrants or lure them into traps at a time when cartels are increasingly using kidnapping and extortion as a means to rake in more money.",
      "One smuggler, who asked to only be identified by his TikTok name \u201cThe Corporation\u201d due to fear of authorities tracking him down said other accounts would steal his migrant smuggling network's videos of customers saying to camera they arrived safely in the U.S.",
      "\u201cAnd there's not much we can do legally. I mean, it's not like we can report them,\u201d he said with a laugh.",
      "In other cases, migrants say that they were forced by traffickers to take the videos even if they haven't arrived safely to their destinations.",
      "The illicit advertisements have fueled concern among international authorities like the U.N.'s International Organization for Migration, which warned in a report about the use of the technology that \u201cnetworks are becoming increasingly sophisticated and evasive, thus challenging government authorities to address new, non-traditional forms of this crime.\u201d",
      "In February, a Mexican prosecutor also confirmed to the AP that they were investigating a network of accounts advertising crossings through a tunnel running under the border fence between Ciudad Juarez and El Paso. But investigators would not provide more details.",
      "In the meantime, hundreds of accounts post videos of trucks crossing border, of stacks of cash and migrants, faces covered with emojis, promising they made it safely across the border.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re continuing to cross and we\u2019re not scared,\u201d one wrote.",
      "___",

      "ROME -- ROME (AP) \u2014 Pope Francis said in a letter published Tuesday that his lengthy illness has helped make \u201cmore lucid\u201d to him the absurdity of war, as his top deputy shot down any suggestion of resignation and plans progressed for an April 8 meeting with Britain's King Charles III.",
      "Italian daily Corriere della Sera published a letter to the editor from Francis, signed and dated March 14 from Rome's Gemelli hospital where the 88-year-old pontiff has been treated since Feb. 14 for a complex lung infection and double pneumonia.",
      "In it, Francis renewed his call for diplomacy and international organizations to find a \u201cnew vitality and credibility.\u201d And he said that his own illness had also helped make some things clearer to him, including the \u201cabsurdity of war.\u201d",
      "\u201cHuman fragility has the power to make us more lucid about what endures and what passes, what brings life and what kills,\u201d he wrote.",
      "Responding to a letter from the newspaper\u2019s editor-in-chief, Luciano Fontana, Francis also urged him and all those in the media to \u201cfeel the full importance of words.\u201d",
      "\u201cThey are never just words: they are facts that shape human environments. They can connect or divide, serve the truth or use it for other ends,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWe must disarm words, to disarm minds and disarm the Earth.\u201d",
      "The letter was published as Francis registered slight improvements in his treatment and as the Vatican No. 2, Cardinal Pietro Parolin, shot down any suggestion the pope might resign.",
      "\u201cAbsolutely no,\u201d Parolin told journalists on Monday. Parolin has visited Francis twice during his hospitalization, most recently March 2, and said he found Francis better then than his first visit Feb. 25.",
      "Francis is now able to spend some time during the day off high flows of oxygen and use just ordinary supplemental oxygen delivered by a nasal tube, the Holy See press office said. Doctors are also trying to cut back on the amount of time he uses a noninvasive mechanical ventilation mask at night, to force his lungs to work more.",
      "While those amount to \u201cslight improvements,\u201d the Vatican isn\u2019t yet providing any timetable on when he might be released. That said, Buckingham Palace announced Monday that King Charles III was scheduled to meet with Francis on April 8 at the Vatican.",
      "Such state visits are always closely organized with Parolin's office, suggesting that the Holy See believed the pope would be back home by then, barring any setbacks.",
      "The developments came as the Vatican released some details on the first photograph of Francis released since his hospitalization. The image, taken Sunday from behind, showed Francis sitting in his wheelchair in his private chapel in prayer without any sign of nasal tubes.",
      "The photo, showing Francis wearing a Lenten purple stole, followed an audio message Francis recorded March 6 in which he thanked people for their prayers, his voice soft and labored.",
      "Together, they suggested Francis is very much controlling how the public follows his illness to prevent it from turning into a spectacle. While many in the Vatican have held up St. John Paul II\u2019s long and public battle with Parkinson\u2019s disease and other ailments as a humble sign of his willingness to show his frailties, others criticized it as excessive and glorifying sickness.",
      "The image certainly reassured some well-wishers who came to Gemelli to pray for Francis, who is recovering in the 10th floor papal suite reserved for popes.",
      "\u201cAfter a month of hospitalization, finally a photo that can assure us that his health conditions are better,\u201d said the Rev. Enrico Antonio, a priest from Pescara.",
      "At the Vatican, Sister Mary, a nun from Kenya, said she thought \u201che looks great.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe situation was very critical. But now seeing the photo, it makes me smile. It makes me feel better,\u201d she said. \u201cIt makes me even feel safer that the church is still going on, that our pope can come back to us.\u201d",
      "But Benedetta Flagiello of Naples, who was visiting her sister who is a patient at Gemelli, wondered if the photo was even real.",
      "\u201cBecause if the pope can sit for a moment without a mask, without anything, why didn\u2019t he look out the window on the 10th floor to be seen by everyone?\u201d she asked. \u201cIf you remember our old pope (John Paul II), he couldn\u2019t speak up, but he showed up.\u201d",

      "They argue that the security situation along NATO's eastern flank has \"fundamentally deteriorated\u201d since they signed on to the Anti-Personnel Mine Ban Convention, and that \u201cmilitary threats to NATO member states bordering Russia and Belarus have significantly increased.\u201d",
      "\u201cWith this decision, we are sending a clear message: Our countries are prepared and can use every necessary measure to defend our territory and freedom,\" they wrote.",
      "Despite the intention to leave the treaty, they said they would remain committed to humanitarian law, including the protection of civilians during armed conflict.",
      "The Ottawa Convention was signed in 1997 and went into force in 1999. Nearly three dozen countries have not acceded to it, including some key current and past producers and users of land mines such as the United States, China, India, Pakistan, South Korea and Russia.",
      "In a report released last year by Landmine Monitor, the international watchdog said land mines were still actively being used in 2023 and 2024 by Russia, Myanmar, Iran and North Korea.",

      "The European Union is hosting a donor conference to garner support for a peaceful transition in Syria following the ouster of President Bashar Assad in December",
      "BRUSSELS -- The European Union hosts a donor conference for Syria on Monday to muster support to ensure a peaceful transition after President Bashar Assad was ousted by an insurgency last December.",
      "Ministers and representatives from Western partners, as well as Syria\u2019s regional neighbors, other Arab countries and U.N. agencies will take part in the one-day meeting in Brussels which will be chaired by EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas.",
      "Syria will attend the conference \u2014 the ninth edition of its kind \u2014 for the first time, and will be represented by Foreign Minister Asaad Hassan al-Shibani. The event was organized in haste by the EU to try to take advantage of the change sweeping the country.",
      "The gathering comes at a precarious time. Syria's new leaders are trying to consolidate control over territory that was divided into de facto mini-states during nearly 14 years of civil war and to rebuild the country\u2019s economy and infrastructure. The United Nations in 2017 estimated it would cost at least $250 billion to rebuild Syria, while experts say that number could reach at least $400 billion.",
      "The prospects of economic recovery have been hampered by harsh Western sanctions that were imposed during Assad\u2019s rule and largely have not been lifted.",
      "The interim government will likely be looking to the Brussels conference to shore up its legitimacy in the eyes of the international community in hopes that the sanctions will be lifted, while also seeking short-term aid.",
      "But the EU in particular is in a quandary as not all has gone well recently.",
      "Last week, an ambush on a Syrian security patrol by gunmen loyal to Assad triggered clashes. Some factions allied with the new government launched sectarian revenge attacks -- primarily targeting members of Assad\u2019s Alawite minority sect -- that monitoring groups say killed hundreds of civilians over several days.",
      "In a statement, the EU called \u201cfor the full respect of Syria\u2019s sovereignty, unity and territorial integrity,\u201d saying that it will only support \u201ca peaceful and inclusive transition, away from malign foreign interference, which guarantees the rights of all Syrians without distinction of any kind.\u201d",
      "Syria is also on the agenda of a meeting of EU foreign ministers that Kallas will chair separately Monday. The 27-nation bloc has begun to ease energy, transport and financial sector sanctions to encourage the new authorities, but remains wary.",
      "The country\u2019s interim rulers have struggled to exert their authority across much of Syria since the Islamist former insurgent group, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or HTS, led a lightning insurgency against Assad.",
      "Former HTS leader Ahmad al-Sharaa is now interim president, and on Thursday he signed a temporary constitution that leaves Syria under Islamist rule for five years during a transitional phase.",
      "While many were happy to see an end to the Assad family\u2019s dictatorial rule of more than 50 years, religious and ethnic minorities are skeptical of the new Islamist leaders and reluctant to allow Damascus under its new leadership to assert control over their areas.",
      "The EU can reintroduce the sanctions if things do not go to the liking of Western backers. At the same time, Syria's economy, infrastructure and institutions lie in tatters. As a failed state it could become another haven for extremists.",
      "People must make do with only a few hours of electricity each day, water supplies are unreliable and often unsafe, unemployment runs to 80% or 90%, and destruction is widespread. Many government employees and experts needed to rebuild fled after the 2011 Arab Spring democracy movement collapsed into conflict and authoritarian rule under Assad.",
      "The U.N. refugee agency said that last year some 7 million people had left their homes but remained in Syria. More than 4.7 million refugees are registered in neighboring countries, most in Turkey, Lebanon and Jordan. Since Assad\u2019s fall though, almost 302,000 have returned.",
      "Despite the challenges, U.N. humanitarian chief Tom Fletcher, who will attend the conference, is upbeat. \u201cIt is now easier for us to operate in Syria and across Syria than it was under the Assad regime,\u201d Fletcher told reporters last week.",
      "\u201cI had excellent conversations with the caretaker authorities,\u201d he said, noting that al-Shibani in particular had helped to keep border crossings open.",
      "While the aim of Monday's conference is to generate aid pledges, it\u2019s also focused on meeting Syria\u2019s economic needs, and that requires calm. Infrastructure, health and education must be scaled up. Jobs and cash for work programs are needed so that Syrians can start to make a living.",

      "The outgoing parliament is set to meet for a final time to vote on the plans as Merz's center-right Union bloc works to put together a governing coalition with the center-left Social Democrats of outgoing Chancellor Olaf Scholz after winning last month's election.",
      "The plans will need a two-thirds majority in parliament's lower house, the Bundestag, because they involve changes to Germany's strict self-imposed borrowing rules \u2014 the so-called \u201cdebt brake,\u201d which allows new borrowing worth only 0.35% of annual gross domestic product and is anchored in the constitution. That forced the prospective coalition partners into negotiations with the environmentalist Greens, whose votes will be needed to get enough support.",
      "The package would exempt from the debt rules spending on defense and security, including intelligence agencies and assistance to Ukraine, of more than 1% of GDP. It also foresees setting up a 500 billion-euro ($544 billion) fund, financed by borrowing, to pour funding into Germany's infrastructure over the next 12 years and help restore the economy \u2014 Europe's biggest \u2014 to growth.",
      "At the Greens' insistence, 100 billion euros from the investment fund will go into climate-related spending.",

      "Recent weeks have brought new urgency to efforts to further strengthen Germany's long-neglected military. The outgoing government created a special 100 billion-euro fund to modernize it, which also helped Berlin meet the current NATO target of spending 2% of GDP on defense. But that pot will be used up in 2027, and doubts have grown recently about the Trump administration's commitment to European allies.",
      "Merz said earlier this month that Germany and Europe must quickly strengthen their defense capability and that \u201c\u2018whatever it takes\u2019 must also go for our defense now.\"",
      "He told ARD television Sunday that \u201cthe situation has once again escalated dramatically in recent weeks\u201d and that Germany's budget had turned out to be in worse shape than previously known.",
      "Of Tuesday's vote, he said: \u201cIt will be close, but it will work.\u201d",
      "\u201cOf course there is still persuasion to be done in all three parliamentary groups, but we should not less this opportunity go unused,\u201d he said.",
      "The package is being brought to the old parliament \u2014 rather than the newly elected one, which will hold its first session on March 25 \u2014 because parties that are unlikely to agree have just over one-third of the seats in the new chamber. The far-right Alternative for Germany portrays itself as a staunch defender of the \u201cdebt brake,\u201d while the Left Party opposes it but is skeptical about military spending.",
      "In the outgoing Bundestag, the Union, Social Democrats and Greens have a combined 520 of the 733 lawmakers \u2014 31 more than are required for a two-thirds majority.",
      "If the package is approved Tuesday, it faces another hurdle Friday in parliament's upper house, which represents Germany's 16 state governments. They are also set to be given more freedom to borrow money.",
      "A two-thirds majority will also be needed in the upper house. That initially was uncertain because the parties behind the plans control only 41 of the 69 upper-house votes. But on Monday, the conservative-led governing coalition in Bavaria, which has six votes, also agreed to support the package.",

      "PepsiCo said Monday it\u2019s acquiring the prebiotic soda brand Poppi for $1.95 billion.",
      "The acquisition gives PepsiCo a fast-growing brand in the popular functional beverage category.",
      "\u201cMore than ever, consumers are looking for convenient and great-tasting options that fit their lifestyles and respond to their growing interest in health and wellness,\u201d PepsiCo Chairman and CEO Ramon Laguarta said in a statement.",
      "PepsiCo said the transaction includes $300 million of anticipated cash benefits, bringing the net purchase price to $1.65 billion.",
      "Allison Ellsworth, the co-founder of Austin, Texas-based Poppi, said the combination with PepsiCo will expand Poppi\u2019s reach.",
      "\u201cWe can\u2019t wait to begin this next chapter with PepsiCo to bring our soda to more people \u2013 and I know they will honor what makes Poppi so special while supporting our next phase of growth and innovation,\u201d Ellsworth said in a statement.",
      "Ellsworth developed Poppi \u2013 then known as Mother Beverage -- in her kitchen in 2015 because she loved soda but was tired of the way it made her feel. She mixed fruit juices with apple cider vinegar, sparkling water and prebiotics and sold the drink at farmer's markets.",
      "The brand took off in 2018 when Ellsworth and her husband pitched it on \u201cShark Tank.\u201d An investor on the show, Rohan Oza, took a stake in Mother Beverage and undertook a major rebrand. Poppi, with its brightly-colored, fruit-forward cans, was born.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re beyond thrilled to be partnering with PepsiCo so that even more consumers across America, and the world, can enjoy Poppi,\u201d said Oza, the co-founder CAVU Consumer Partners, which has also invested in beverage brands like Oatly and Bai.",
      "But it hasn\u2019t all been smooth sailing for Poppi. Last summer, a class-action lawsuit was filed against the brand by a consumer who said its products don\u2019t improve gut health as much as their marketing suggests.",

      "The jury will deliberate after the closing arguments and jury instructions. Nine jurors and two alternates have heard the case.",
      "North Dakota District Court Judge James Gion told the jury last month when the trial began, \u201cYou are the judges of all questions of fact in this case,\u201d and to \u201cbase your verdict on the evidence.\u201d",
      "Dallas-based Energy Transfer and its subsidiary Dakota Access alleged defamation, trespass, nuisance and other offenses by Netherlands-based Greenpeace International, its American branch Greenpeace USA, and funding arm Greenpeace Fund Inc. The pipeline company is seeking hundreds of millions of dollars in damages.",
      "The lawsuit stems from protests in 2016 and 2017 of the controversial Dakota Access Pipeline and its Missouri River crossing upstream of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe's reservation. The tribe for years has opposed the pipeline as a risk to its water supply. The pipeline has transported oil since mid-2017.",
      "Trey Cox, an attorney for the pipeline company, previously said Greenpeace \u201cplanned, organized and funded a game plan to stop construction\u201d of the pipeline, \u201cwhatever the cost.\u201d",
      "Cox also alleged Greenpeace paid outsiders to come into the area to protest, sent blockade supplies, organized or led protester trainings, passed \u201ccritical intel\u201d to the protesters and told untrue statements to stop the line from being built.",
      "He said a letter signed by leaders of Greenpeace International and Greenpeace USA and sent to Energy Transfer's banks contained an allegedly defamatory statement that the company desecrated burial grounds and culturally important sites during construction.",
      "Greenpeace's \u201cdeceptive narrative scared off lenders\u201d and the company lost half its banks, Cox said.",
      "Attorneys for the Greenpeace entities denied the allegations, saying there is no evidence, they had little or no involvement with the protests and the letter was signed by hundreds of organizations from dozens of countries, with no financial institution to testify the organization received, read or was influenced by the letter.",
      "Greenpeace representatives have said the lawsuit is an example of corporations abusing the legal system to go after critics and is a critical test of free speech and protest rights. An Energy Transfer spokesperson said the case is about Greenpeace not following the law, not free speech.",

      "MEXICO CITY -- The videos roll through TikTok in 30-second flashes.",
      "Migrants trek in camouflage through dry desert terrain. Dune buggies roar up to the United States-Mexico border barrier. Families with young children pass through gaps in the wall. Helicopters, planes, yachts, tunnels and jet skis stand by for potential customers.",
      "Laced with emojis, the videos posted by smugglers offer a simple promise: If you don\u2019t have a visa in the U.S., trust us. We\u2019ll get you over safely.",
      "At a time when legal pathways to the U.S. have been slashed and criminal groups are raking in money from migrant smuggling, social media apps like TikTok have become an essential tool for smugglers and migrants alike. The videos \u2014 taken to cartoonish extremes \u2014 offer a rare look inside a long elusive industry and the narratives used by trafficking networks to fuel migration north.",
      "\u201cWith God\u2019s help, we\u2019re going to continue working to fulfill the dreams of foreigners. Safe travels without robbing our people,\u201d wrote one enterprising smuggler.",
      "As President Donald Trump begins to ramp up a crackdown at the border and migration levels to the U.S. dip, smugglers say new technologies allow networks to be more agile in the face of challenges, and expand their reach to new customers \u2014 a far cry from the old days when each village had its trusted smuggler.",
      "\u201cIn this line of work, you have to switch tactics,\u201d said a woman named Soary, part of a smuggling network bringing migrants from Ciudad Juarez to El Paso, Texas, who spoke to The Associated Press on the condition that her last name would not be shared out of concern that authorities would track her down. \u201cTikTok goes all over the world.\"",
      "Soary, 24, began working in smuggling when she was 19, living in El Paso, where she was approached by a friend about a job. She would use her truck to pick up migrants who had recently jumped the border. Despite the risks involved with working with trafficking organizations, she said it earned her more as a single mother than her previous job putting in hair extensions.",
      "As she gained more contacts on both sides of the border, she began connecting people from across the Americas with a network of smugglers to sneak them across borders and eventually into the U.S.",
      "Like many smugglers, she would take videos of migrants speaking to the camera after crossing the border to send over WhatsApp as evidence to loved ones that her clients had gotten to their destination safely. Now she posts those clips to TikTok.",
      "TikTok says the platform strictly prohibits human smuggling and reports such content to law enforcement.",
      "The use of social media to facilitate migration took off around 2017 and 2018, when activists built massive WhatsApp groups to coordinate the first major migrant caravans traveling from Central America to the U.S., according to Guadalupe Correa-Cabrera, a professor at George Mason University focused on the migrant smuggling industry.",
      "Later, smugglers began to infiltrate those chats and use the choice social media app of the day, expanding to Facebook and Instagram.",
      "Migrants, too, began to document their often perilous voyages north, posting videos trekking through the jungles of the Darien Gap dividing Colombia and Panama, and after being released by extorting cartels.",
      "A 2023 study by the United Nations reported that 64% of the migrants they interviewed had access to a smart phone and the internet during their migration to the U.S.",
      "Around the time of the study's release, as use of the app began to soar, that Correa-Cabrera said she began to see smuggling ads skyrocket on TikTok.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a marketing strategy,\u201d Correa-Cabrera said. \u201cEveryone was on TikTok, particularly after the pandemic, and then it began to multiply.\u201d",
      "Last year, Soary, the smuggler, said she began to publish videos of migrants and families in the U.S. with their faces covered and photos of the U.S.-Mexico border with messages like: \u201cWe\u2019ll pass you through Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez, no matter where you are. Fence jumping, treks and by tunnel. Adults, children and the elderly.\u201d",
      "Hundreds of videos examined by the AP feature thick wads of cash, people crossing through the border fence by night, helicopters and airplanes supposedly used by coyotes, smugglers cutting open cacti in the desert for migrants to drink from and even crops of lettuce with text reading \u201cThe American fields are ready!\u201d",
      "The videos are often layered over heavy northern Mexican music with lyrics waxing romantically about being traffickers. Videos are published by accounts with names alluding to \u201csafe crossing,\u201d \u201cUSA destinations,\u201d \u201cfulfilling dreams\u201d or \u201cpolleros,\u201d as smugglers are often called.",
      "Narratives shift based on the political environment and immigration policies in the U.S. During the Biden administration, posts would advertise getting migrants access to asylum applications through the administration's CBP One app, which Trump ended.",
      "Amid Trump's crackdown, posts have shifted to dispelling fears that migrants will be captured, promising American authorities have been paid off. Smugglers openly taunt U.S. authorities: one shows himself smoking what appears to be marijuana right in front of the border wall; another even takes a jab at Trump, referring to the president as a \u201chigh-strung gringo.\u201d",
      "Comments are dotted with emojis of flags and baby chickens, a symbol meaning migrant among smugglers, and other users asking for prices and more information.",
      "Cristina, who migrated because she struggled make ends meet in the Mexican state of Zacatecas, was among those scrolling in December after the person she had hired to smuggle her to the U.S. abandoned her and her partner in Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez.",
      "\u201cIn a moment of desperation, I started searching on TikTok and, well, with the algorithm videos began to pop up,\u201d she said. \u201cIt took me a half an hour\u201d to find a smuggler.",
      "After connecting, smugglers and migrants often negotiate on encrypted apps like WhatsApp and Telegram, doing a careful dance to gain each other's trust. Cristina, now living in Phoenix, said she decided to trust Soary because she was a woman and posted videos of families, something the smuggler admitted was a tactic to gain migrants' trust.",
      "Smugglers, migrants and authorities warn that such videos have been used to scam migrants or lure them into traps at a time when cartels are increasingly using kidnapping and extortion as a means to rake in more money.",
      "One smuggler, who asked to only be identified by his TikTok name \u201cThe Corporation\u201d due to fear of authorities tracking him down said other accounts would steal his migrant smuggling network's videos of customers saying to camera they arrived safely in the U.S.",
      "\u201cAnd there's not much we can do legally. I mean, it's not like we can report them,\u201d he said with a laugh.",
      "In other cases, migrants say that they were forced by traffickers to take the videos even if they haven't arrived safely to their destinations.",
      "The illicit advertisements have fueled concern among international authorities like the U.N.'s International Organization for Migration, which warned in a report about the use of the technology that \u201cnetworks are becoming increasingly sophisticated and evasive, thus challenging government authorities to address new, non-traditional forms of this crime.\u201d",
      "In February, a Mexican prosecutor also confirmed to the AP that they were investigating a network of accounts advertising crossings through a tunnel running under the border fence between Ciudad Juarez and El Paso. But investigators would not provide more details.",
      "In the meantime, hundreds of accounts post videos of trucks crossing border, of stacks of cash and migrants, faces covered with emojis, promising they made it safely across the border.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re continuing to cross and we\u2019re not scared,\u201d one wrote.",
      "___",

      "Experts say the case at the state court in Hamm, in western Germany, could set a significant precedent in the fight to hold major polluters accountable for climate change.",
      "Sa\u00fal Luciano Lliuya's lawsuit against RWE argues that the company\u2019s historical greenhouse gas emissions have fueled global warming, accelerating glacial melt above his hometown of Huaraz, Peru. As a result, Lake Palcacocha has swelled to dangerous levels, threatening the community with the risk of catastrophic flooding.",
      "RWE, which has never operated in Peru, denies legal responsibility, arguing that climate change is a global issue caused by many contributors.",
      "The mountains, glaciers and lakes \u201cgive us water, give us life,\u201d Lliuya said outside the courthouse, standing in front of photos of glaciers in the shape of mountains. But \u201cthe glaciers are melting, are disappearing bit by bit. Some lakes, lakes like Palcacocha \u2014 it's a risk to me, to more than 50,000 people who live in the zone at risk.\u201d",

      "Shopping for a new home",
      "Shopping for a new home? Ready to renovate your kitchen or install a new deck? You'll be paying more to do so.",
      "The Trump administration\u2019s tariffs on imported goods from Canada, Mexico and China \u2014 some already in place, others set to take effect in a few weeks \u2014 are already driving up the cost of building materials used in new residential construction and home remodeling projects.",
      "The tariffs are projected to raise the costs that go into building a single-family home in the U.S. by $7,500 to $10,000, according to the National Association of Home Builders. Such costs are typically passed along to the homebuyer in the form of higher prices, which could hurt demand at a time when the U.S. housing market remains in a slump and many builders are having to offer buyers costly incentives to drum up sales.",
      "We Buy Houses in San Francisco, which purchases foreclosed homes and then typically renovates and sells them, is increasing prices on its refurbished properties between 7% and 12%. That's even after saving $52,000 in costs by stockpiling 62% more Canadian lumber than usual.",
      "\u201cThe uncertainty of how long these tariffs will continue has been the most challenging aspect of our planning,\u201d said CEO Mamta Saini.",
      "The timing of the tariffs couldn\u2019t be worse for homebuilders and the home remodeling industry, as this is typically the busiest time of year for home sales. The prospect of a trade war has roiled the stock market and stoked worries about the economy, which could lead many would-be homebuyers to remain on the sidelines.",
      "\u201cRising costs due to tariffs on imports will leave builders with few options,\u201d said Danielle Hale, chief economist at Realtor.com. \u201cThey can choose to pass higher costs along to consumers, which will mean higher home prices, or try to use less of these materials, which will mean smaller homes.\u201d",
      "Prices for building materials, including lumber, have been rising, even though the White House has delayed its tariffs rollout on some products. Lumber futures jumped to $658.71 per thousand board feet on March 4, reaching their highest level in more than two years.",
      "The increase is already inflating costs for construction projects.",
      "Dana Schnipper, a partner at building materials supplier JC Ryan in Farmingdale, New York, sourced wooden doors and frames for an apartment complex in Nassau County from a company in Canada that cost less than the American equivalent.",
      "Half the job has already been supplied. But once the tariff goes into effect it will be applied to the remaining $75,000, adding $19,000 to the at-cost total. Once JC Ryan applies its mark up, that means the customer will owe $30,000 more than originally planned, Schnipper said.",
      "He also expects the tariffs will give American manufacturers cover to raise prices on steel components.",
      "\u201cThese prices will never come down,\u201d Schnipper said. \u201cWhatever is going to happen, these things will be sticky and hopefully we\u2019re good enough as a small business, that we can absorb some of that. We can\u2019t certainly absorb all of it, so I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s going to be an interesting couple of months.\u201d",
      "Sidestepping the tariffs by using an alternative to imported building materials isn\u2019t always an option.",
      "Bar Zakheim, owner of Better Place Design & Build, a contracting business in San Diego that specializes in building accessible dwelling units, or ADUs, said Canada remains the best source for lumber.",
      "By sticking with imported lumber, Zakheim had to raise his prices about 15% compared with a year ago. He also has 8% fewer jobs lined up compared with last year.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not about to go out of business, but it\u2019s looking to be a slow, expensive year for us,\u201d he said.",
      "On March 6, the Trump administration announced a one-month delay on its 25% tariffs on certain imports from Mexico and Canada, including softwood lumber. Tariffs of 20% on imports from China are already in effect. A 25% tariff on steel and aluminum imports \u2014 50% on those from Canada \u2014 kicked in on March 12.",
      "Tariffs on Mexican and Canadian goods slated to go into effect next month will raise the cost of imported construction materials by more than $3 billion, according to the NAHB. Those price hikes would be in addition to a 14.5% tariff on Canadian lumber previously imposed by the U.S., ratcheting up tariffs on Canadian lumber to 39.5%.",
      "Building materials costs overall are already up 34% since December 2020, according to the NAHB.",
      "Builders depend on raw materials, appliances and many other components produced abroad. About 7.3% of all products used in single-family home and apartment building construction are imported. Of those, nearly a quarter come from Canada and Mexico, according to the NAHB.",
      "Both nations also account for 70% of the imports of two key home construction materials: lumber and gypsum. Canadian lumber is used in everything from framing to cabinetry and furniture. Mexican gypsum is used to make drywall.",
      "Beyond raw materials, refrigerators, washing machines, air conditioners and an array of other home components are manufactured in Mexico and China, which is also a key source of steel and aluminum.",
      "The tariffs will mean higher prices for home improvement shoppers, said Dent Johnson, president of True Value Hardware, which operates more than 4,000 independently owned hardware stores.",
      "\u201cThe reality is that many products on the shelves of your local hardware store will eventually be affected,\u201d he said in a statement emailed to The Associated Press.",
      "Confusion over the timing and scope of the tariffs, and their impact on the economy, could have a bigger chilling effect on the new-home market than higher prices.",
      "\u201cIf consumers can\u2019t plan, if builders can\u2019t plan, it gets very difficult to know how to price product because you don\u2019t know what price you need to move it,\u201d said Carl Reichardt, a homebuilding analyst at BTIG. \u201cIf people are worried about their jobs, worried about the future, it\u2019s very difficult to make the decision to buy a new home, whatever the price.\u201d",
      "The uncertainty created by the Trump administration\u2019s tariffs policy will probably result in increased volatility for home sales and new home construction this year, said Robert Dietz, the NAHB's chief economist.",
      "Still, because it can take several months for a home to be built, the larger impact of from building materials costs are going to happen \u201cdown the road,\u201d Dietz said.",
      "The impact tariffs are having on consumers is already evident at Slutsky Lumber in Ellenville, N.Y.",
      "\u201cThere are not as many people getting ready for spring like they usually are,\u201d said co-owner Jonathan Falcon. \u201cIt seems like people are just cutting back on spending.\u201d",
      "Falcon also worries that smaller businesses like his will have a tough time absorbing the impact of the tariffs.",
      "\u201cThis is just like another thing that\u2019s going to be harder for small lumber yards to handle than the big guys and just sort of keep driving businesses like us to not make it,\u201d he said.",

      "The Portland, Oregon, resident could sympathize with those drivers: He knew to avoid his own neighborhood pothole, but another one damaged his car's suspension to the tune of $1,000.",
      "\u201cHearing that awful sound of your car bottoming out \u2014 it\u2019s horrible,\" he said.",
      "Oregon transportation officials say that without more funding, residents like Taylor could see further declines in the quality of roads, highways and bridges starting this year. But revenues from gas taxes paid by drivers at the pump are projected to decrease as more people adopt electric and fuel-efficient cars, forcing officials to look for new ways to fund transportation infrastructure.",
      "States with aggressive climate goals like Oregon are facing a conundrum: EVs can help reduce emissions in the transportation sector, the nation's largest source of greenhouse gas emissions, but they also mean less gas tax revenue in government coffers.",
      "\u201cWe now find ourselves right now in a position where we want to address fuel use and drive down reliance on gases and internal combustion engines. But we need the funds to operate our roads that EVs need to use as well,\u201d said Carra Sahler, director of the Green Energy Institute at Lewis & Clark Law School.",
      "Motor fuel taxes are the largest source of transportation revenue for states, according to the National Association of Budget Officers\u2019 most recent report on state expenditures. But the money they bring in has fallen: Gas taxes raised 41% of transportation revenue in fiscal year 2016, compared with roughly 36% in fiscal year 2024, the group found.",
      "In California, where zero-emission vehicles accounted for about a quarter of all car sales last year, legislative analysts predict gas tax collections will decrease by $5 billion \u2014 or 64% \u2014 by 2035, in a scenario where the state successfully meets its climate goals. California and Oregon are among the multiple states that will require all new passenger cars sold to be zero-emission vehicles by 2035.",

      "That could mean cuts to winter snow plowing and the striping and paving of roads, as well as layoffs of as many as 1,000 transportation employees.",
      "Republican lawmakers say the gas tax revenue issue has been compounded by the department mismanaging its money. An audit released in January found the department overestimated its revenue for the current budget cycle by over $1 billion and failed to properly track certain funds.",
      "\u201cIt really is about making sure that the existing dollars that are being spent by the department are being spent efficiently and effectively,\u201d said state Sen. Bruce Starr, GOP co-vice chair of the joint transportation committee.",
      "To make up for lost revenue, 34 states have raised their gas tax since 2013, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. California has the highest gas tax at over 69 cents a gallon when including other taxes and fees, while Alaska has the lowest at 9 cents a gallon, according to figures from the U.S. Energy Information Administration. In Oregon \u2014 which in 1919 became the first state to implement a gas tax \u2014 it is 40 cents a gallon.",
      "The federal gas tax of 18 cents a gallon, which isn\u2019t adjusted for inflation, hasn\u2019t been raised in over three decades.",
      "In Oregon, where there is no sales tax and tolling has met fierce opposition, lawmakers are debating next steps.",
      "Other states have taken steps ranging from indexing their gas tax to inflation, to raising registration fees for EVs, to taxing EV charging stations.",
      "To bolster transportation dollars, some have reorganized their budgets: In Michigan, where Gov. Gretchen Whitmer was first elected using the slogan \u201cFix the Damn Roads,\u201d some revenues from marijuana taxes and personal income taxes now go toward transportation. In Connecticut, the sales tax now brings in more money for its special transportation fund than gas tax revenues, a 2024 fiscal report shows.",
      "Another concept that could provide a long-term solution is a so-called road user charge. Under such a system, drivers pay a fee based on the distance they travel.",
      "In 2023, Hawaii established a road usage charge program for EV drivers that will phase in starting this July. In 2028, all EV drivers will be automatically enrolled, with odometers read at annual vehicle inspections.",

    "story": [
      "The United States under President Donald Trump has launched a new campaign of intense airstrikes targeting Yemen\u2019s Houthi rebels",
      "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- The United States under President Donald Trump has launched a new campaign of intense airstrikes targeting Yemen's Houthi rebels.",
      "This weekend's strikes killed at least 53 people, including children, and wounded others. The campaign is likely to continue, part of a wider pressure campaign by Trump now targeting the Houthis' main benefactor, Iran, as well.",
      "Here's what to know about the U.S. strikes and what could happen next:",
      "The Houthi rebels attacked over 100 merchant vessels with missiles and drones, sinking two vessels and killing four sailors, from November 2023 until January this year. Their leadership described the attacks as aiming to end the Israeli war against Hamas in the Gaza Strip. The campaign also greatly raised the Houthis' profile in the wider Arab world and tamped down on public criticism against their human rights abuses and crackdowns on dissent and aid workers.",
      "Trump, writing on his social media platform Truth Social, said his administration targeted the Houthis over their \u201cunrelenting campaign of piracy, violence and terrorism.\u201d He noted the disruption Houthi attacks have caused through the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden, key waterways for energy and cargo shipments between Asia and Europe through Egypt's Suez Canal.",
      "\u201cWe will use overwhelming lethal force until we have achieved our objective,\u201d Trump said.",
      "Under former President Joe Biden, the U.S. and the United Kingdom began a series of airstrikes against the Houthis starting in January 2024. A December report by The International Institute for Strategic Studies said the U.S. and its partners struck the Houthis over 260 times up to that point.",
      "U.S. military officials during that period acknowledged having a far-wider target list for possible strikes. While the Biden administration didn't go too far into explaining its targeting, analysts believe officials largely were trying to avoid civilian casualties and not rekindle Yemen's stalemated war, which pits the Houthis and their allies against the country's exiled government and their local and international allies, like Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.",
      "The Trump administration, however, appears willing to go after more targets, based on the weekend's strikes and public remarks made by officials.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re doing the entire world a favor by getting rid of these guys and their ability to strike global shipping,\u201d U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio told CBS News' \u201cFace The Nation\u201d on Sunday. \u201cThat\u2019s the mission here, and it will continue until that\u2019s carried out.\u201d",
      "Rubio added: \u201cSome of the key people involved in those missile launches are no longer with us, and I can tell you that some of the facilities that they used are no longer existing, and that will continue.\u201d",
      "In two words: More attacks.",
      "The Houthis said last week they'll again target \u201cIsraeli\u201d ships traveling through Mideast waterways like the Gulf of Aden and the Red Sea, because of Israel's blocking of aid to the Gaza Strip. No rebel attack targeting commercial shipping has been reported as of Monday morning.",
      "However, the new U.S. campaign likely could inspire Houthi attacks at sea or on land beyond American warships. The rebels previously targeted oil infrastructure in Saudi Arabia and the UAE, two countries deeply involved in Yemen's war since 2015.",
      "\u201cAlthough the U.S. has been striking at Houthi targets for over a year, the scope and scale of this new campaign, including the targeting of senior Houthi figures, marks a significant escalation in the conflict,\u201d analysts at the Eurasia Group said Monday.",
      "Gulf Arab countries \"will distance themselves from ongoing hostilities but now face threats to their major oil infrastructure. The Houthis will want to hit President Donald Trump where it hurts, oil prices.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, the Houthis likely will expand their possible targets for ship attacks, meaning shippers will continue to stay out of the region, said Jakob P. Larsen, the head of maritime security for BIMCO, the largest international association representing shipowners.",
      "Iran long has armed the Houthis, who are members of Islam\u2019s minority Shiite Zaydi sect, which ruled Yemen for 1,000 years until 1962. Tehran routinely denies arming the rebels, despite physical evidence, numerous seizures and experts tying the weapons back to Iran. That's likely because Tehran wants to avoid sanctions for violating a United Nations arms embargo on the Houthis.",
      "The Houthis now form the strongest group within Iran's self-described \u201cAxis of Resistance.\" Others like Lebanon's Hezbollah and the Palestinian militant group Hamas have been decimated by Israel after the Oct. 7, 2023, attack by Hamas that sparked Israel's war of attrition in the Gaza Strip. Allied Shiite militias in Iraq largely have kept their heads down since the U.S. launched retaliatory attacks last year over a drone attack that killed three American troops and injured at least 34 others at a military base in Jordan.",
      "While Iranian state television aired footage of civilian casualties from the weekend strikes in Yemen, top political leaders stayed away from suggestion Tehran itself would get involved in the fight. Revolutionary Guard chief Gen. Hossein Salami notably underscored the Houthis made their own decisions \u2014 while not offering any warning over what would happen if the strikes killed any members of the Guard's expeditionary Quds Force, who are believed to actively support the rebels on the ground.",
      "\u201cWe have always declared \u2014 and we declare again today \u2014 that the Yemenis are an independent and free nation in their own land, with an independent national policy,\u201d Salami said.",
      "Trump's national security adviser Mike Waltz, speaking to ABC's \u201cThis Week\u201d on Sunday, warned Guard officials training the Houthis \u201cwill be on the table too\u201d as possible targets for attack.",
      "Meanwhile, Iran is still trying to determine how to respond to a letter from Trump aiming to restart negotiations over Tehran's rapidly advancing nuclear program. Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Esmail Baghaei said Monday officials continue to review the letter and will respond \"after investigations are completed.\u201d",
      "Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi separately traveled Sunday to Oman, which long has been an interlocutor between Tehran and the West. The Houthis also operate a political office in the sultanate.",
      "The attacks on the Houthis are \u201ca not-so-subtle signal to Iran, as President Trump has been unequivocal in his insistence that Iran return to the negotiating table to deal with its nuclear program,\u201d the New York-based Soufan Center said in an analysis Monday.",

      "\u201cWhile we have evaluated all options to best position the company for the future, we have been unable to find a sustainable path forward, given competition from foreign fast fashion companies, which have been able to take advantage of the de minimis exemption to undercut our brand on pricing and margin,\u201d Chief Financial Officer Brad Sell said in a statement.",
      "The de minimis tax exemption lets shipments headed to U.S. businesses and consumers valued at less than $800 to enter the country tax free and duty free.",
      "Forever 21 stores in the U.S. will hold liquidation sales and the website will continue to run while operations wind down. The retailer's locations outside of the U.S. are run by other licensees and are not included in the bankruptcy filing. International store locations and websites will continue operating as normal.",
      "Authentic Brands Group owns the international intellectual property associated with the Forever 21 brand and may license the brand to other operators, F21OpCo said.",
      "Forever 21 first filed for bankruptcy protection in 2019. It was acquired by a consortium of parties including Authentic Brands Group and mall owners Simon Property Group and Brookfield Property Partners.",
      "Forever 21 was founded in 1984 and, along with other fast-fashion chains like H&M and Zara, rode a wave of popularity among young customers in the mid-1990s. Their popularity grew during the Great Recession, when shoppers were seeking bargains. But Forever 21 went on an aggressive expansion just as shoppers were moving more online.",
      "Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData, said in a statement that part of the problem now is that Forever 21's stores are too big for its current needs and it's in malls with not enough foot traffic.",
      "\u201cForever 21 was always a retailer living on borrowed time. Over recent years it has been hit with dual headwinds from a weak apparel market and stiff competition from cheap Chinese marketplaces,\u201d he said. \u201cBoth things have eroded its standing and depleted its market share.\u201d",

      "LONDON -- LONDON (AP) \u2014 Thames Water, which serves 16 million people in and around London, has received court approval for up to 3 billion pounds ($3.7 billion) of emergency funding, preventing the company from falling into government administration.",
      "The High Court in London on Monday dismissed an appeal from a small group of creditors who argued that the funding package was too expensive and favored bigger lenders. The appeal challenged the court\u2019s earlier decision to authorize the deal, which has been backed by lenders holding about 90% of the company\u2019s debt.",
      "The court said it would release the reasoning behind its decision at a later date.",
      "Thames Water, which has about 17 billion pounds ($20.9 billion) of debt, was in danger of running out of money within days if the court had not authorized the new funding. That would have forced the government to consider nationalizing the company.",
      "Both the government and Thames Water say water will continue flowing to customers regardless of what happens.",
      "Thames Water is at the center of nationwide anger over sewage spills that have fouled lakes, rivers and beaches at a time when water and sewage companies are seeking billions of pounds in rate increases to modernize their systems and cope with the demands of climate change and population growth.",
      "Consumers and politicians have criticized the company, arguing that Thames Water created its own problems by paying overly generous dividends to investors and high salaries to executives while failing to invest in pipelines, pumps and reservoirs. Company executives say the fault lies with regulators who kept bills too low for too long, starving the company of the cash it needed to fund improvements.",
      "Ofwat, which regulates water companies in England and Wales, in December approved a 35% increase in Thames Water\u2019s consumer charges over the next five years.

      "On Friday, a measure of consumer sentiment fell sharply for the third straight month and is now down more than 20% since December. Respondents to the University of Michigan's survey cited policy uncertainty as a leading reason for the gloomier outlook. While the respondents were divided sharply by party \u2014 sentiment about the current economy fell among Republican by much less than for Democrats \u2014 Republicans' confidence in the economy's future dropped 10%.",

      "February sales also fell last month at gas stations, clothing stores, and sporting goods stores. The figures aren't adjusted for prices, and the cost of gas also declined in February, which likely accounts for most of the drop. Excluding gas and autos, retail sales rose 0.5%, a healthier figure but still modest after a plunge of 0.8% in January.",
      "Also Monday, the National Association of Homebuilders said its index measuring builder sentiment fell three points to 39, the lowest level in seven months, as economic uncertainty dimmed builders' outlook and fewer potential buyers visited homes.",
      "\u201cEconomic uncertainty, the threat of tariffs and elevated construction costs pushed builder sentiment down in March,\u201d the group said. The homebuilders estimate tariffs will add $9,200 to the cost of a new home.",

      "Hiring has mostly held up and there are no signs that companies are laying off workers. As long as Americans have jobs, spending could remain resilient. But that is not assured.",
      "Dollar General CEO Todd Vasos said Thursday that the overall economic picture for his customers is not ideal and the company said it would close around 100 stores.",
      "\u201cOur customers continue to report that their financial situation has worsened over the last year as they have been negatively impacted by ongoing inflation \u201d Vasos said during an earnings call. \u201cMany of our customers report that they only have enough money for basic essentials, with some noting that they have had to sacrifice even on the necessities.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "In the Central Mamuju district of Indonesia\u2019s West Sulawesi, where the Budong-Budong River meets the sea, people have long feared crocodiles",
      "BUDONG-BUDONG, Indonesia -- Nearly seven months after a crocodile attack almost took her life, Munirpa walked to the estuary outside her home with her husband and her children, ready to brave a reenactment.",
      "Munirpa, who like many Indonesians only uses one name, recounted how one early morning in August, she threw her household garbage into a creek about 50 meters (164 feet) away from her house, as she normally would.",
      "She didn't see what was coming next.",
      "By the time she realized a crocodile had attacked her, the four-meter-long (13-foot) beast had already sunk its teeth into most of her body, sparing only her head. She fought hard, trying to jab its eyes. Her husband, hearing her screams, ran over and tried to pull her by the thigh out of the crocodile's jaws. A tug-of-war ensued; the reptile whipped him with its tail. Fortunately, he saved Munirpa in time, eventually dragging her out of the crocodile's grip.",
      "People have long feared the ancient predators in the Central Mamuju district of Indonesia\u2019s West Sulawesi, where the Budong-Budong River meets the sea. For Munirpa, 48, that fear turned into a brutal reality when she became one of nearly 180 recorded crocodile attack victims in Indonesia last year. Residents like her are learning to coexist with the crocodiles, a legally protected species in Indonesia, as they balance conservation with looking out for their safety. But as attacks rise, several residents and experts have called for better government interventions to stop the problem from getting even worse.",
      "Following the attack, Munirpa was hospitalized for a month and has had two surgeries. By February this year, her fear was still clearly visible, as were the scars on her legs and thighs.",
      "\u201cI am so scared. I don\u2019t want to go to the beach. Even to the back of the house, I don\u2019t dare to go,\" said Munirpa. \u201cI am traumatized. I asked my children not to go to the river, or to the backyard, or go fishing.\"",
      "In the villages surrounding the Budong-Budong River, like Munirpa's, crocodiles have become a daily topic of conversation. Their presence has become so common that warning signs now mark the areas where they lurk, from the river mouth to the waterways which were once a popular swimming spot for children.",
      "In 2024, there were 179 crocodile attacks in Indonesia, the highest number of crocodile attacks in the world, with 92 fatalities, according to CrocAttack, an independent database. Social media videos showing crocodile appearances and attacks in Sulawesi and other regions in Indonesia are also on the rise.",
      "The increase in attacks began about 12 years ago with the rise of palm oil plantations around the river mouth, said 39-year-old crocodile handler Rusli Paraili. Some companies carved artificial waterways, linking them to the larger part of the Budong-Budong River. That was when the crocodiles started straying, leaving the river and creeping to nearby residential areas, such as fish and shrimp ponds, he explained.",
      "Palm oil plantations now dominate the landscape in West Sulawesi, from the mountains to the coast, and patrolling for crocodiles has become part of people's daily routine. When residents check the water pumps in their ponds, they have no choice but to keep out an eye for the beasts \u2014 flashlights in hand, scouring up, down and across canals and waterways \u2014 resigned to the uneasy reality of sharing their home with a predator.",
      "The saltwater crocodile has been a legally protected species in Indonesia since 1999, making it an animal that cannot be hunted freely. As a top predator, there is also no population control in nature.",
      "Paraili, the crocodile handler, said that while the law protects crocodiles from being killed, the rise in attacks is a major concern. In response, he's taken care of some of the crocs in a specially-designed farm away from human populations. He's received some financial support from the government and community donations, as well as support from palm oil companies for the last five years.",
      "The farm has four ponds and around 50 reptiles. Some have names: Tanker, the largest, shaped like a ship, or Karossa, named after the sub-district the animal was caught after fatally attacking someone.",
      "When funds run low, he uses his own money to ensure they\u2019re fed, at least once every four days.",
      "Amir Hamidy, who studies reptiles at the National Research and Innovation Agency, worries the rise in attacks indicates that crocodile numbers are becoming far too dangerous. Hamidy supports better population control.",
      "Being a protected species \u201cdoes not necessarily mean that the population cannot be reduced when it is at a level that is indeed unsafe,\" he said.",
      "Around a year ago in Tumbu village, Suardi, who goes by one name, was harvesting coconuts when they fell into the river. When he went to retrieve them, he was attacked by a crocodile he initially didn't notice. He's since made a full recovery.",
      "Still, the experience has made him more cautious. \u201cYes, I am worried. But what else can we do,\" Suardi said. \u201cThe important thing is that we are careful enough.\u201d",
      "Along with Munirpa, Suardi is one of 10 people in the region who was attacked by a crocodile last year. Three of those attacked were killed.",
      "Suyuti Marzuki, who's head of West Sulawesi Marine and Fisheries Agency, said the crocodile habitat shift is making people's everyday activities \u2014 like harvesting coconuts, fishing or even disposing of garbage like Munirpa \u2014 very risky.",
      "Marzuki said the government is looking at possible options that can provide both safety and economic alternatives for residents.",
      "While he acknowledged that crocodile population numbers and ecosystems need to be protected, Marzuki also raised the possibility of bolstering the local economy through the crocodile skin trade. That industry is controversial because of conservation and animal welfare issues.",
      "Paraili, the crocodile handler, also urged serious government interventions.",
      "\"This is a matter of human lives. So when the government is not serious, then our brothers and sisters in the future \u2014 in 5 or 15 years \u2014 there will be even more who will die from being attacked by crocodiles,\u201d he said.",
      "Residents like Munirpa and Suardi are waiting for more immediate and realistic steps from the authorities to ensure their community's and families' safety.",
      "\u201cIt is enough that I've been bitten by a crocodile,\" Munirpa said. \u201cI won\u2019t let it happen to my children.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "With U.S. support for Ukraine in doubt, Kyiv\u2019s European allies are weighing whether to seize $300 billion in frozen Russian assets",
      "FRANKFURT, Germany -- With U.S. support for Ukraine in doubt, Kyiv's European allies are weighing whether to seize $300 billion in frozen Russian assets and use the money to compensate Ukraine, support its military and help rebuild shattered homes and towns.",
      "For now, the assets are still on ice, with opponents of seizure warning that the move could violate international law and destabilize financial markets.",
      "Here are key things to know about the debate surrounding the Kremlin assets that were frozen shortly after Russia's full-scale invasion in early 2022:",
      "Originally, the money was in short-term government bonds held as reserves for the Russian central bank. By now, most of the bonds have have matured and turned into cash piling up in custodian banks. Some 210 billion euros are in European Union member states, with the biggest chunk, some 183 billion euros, at Euroclear, a Belgian clearinghouse for financial transactions. Other amounts are at financial institutions in Great Britain, Japan, France, Canada, Switzerland, Australia and Singapore.",
      "So far, the Group of Seven democracies have used the interest on the frozen cash to fund $50 billion in upfront assistance to Ukraine by borrowing against future interest income. That solution avoids legal and financial complications associated with outright confiscating the money and giving it it to Ukraine.",
      "Some of Ukraine's friends \u2014 Poland, the United Kingdom and the Baltic states Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia \u2014 want to do more by taking the principal as well, given the enormous damage Russia has done. The World Bank estimates that reconstructing Ukraine will cost $524 billion over 10 years, already more than the total of the Russian assets. If one or more Western governments resists seizing the assets, the others that want to could still go ahead.",
      "Meanwhile, Ukraine's allies in Europe are contemplating stepping up their financial aid in the wake of statements by U.S. President Donald Trump that Europe must take care of its own security. Several of those allies \u2014 France and Belgium, for instance \u2014 are already saddled with troublesome debt levels above 100% of gross domestic product.",
      "European leaders say seizing the assets now would mean they couldn't be used as a bargaining chip in any peace deal or to help enforce a ceasefire.",
      "French Finance Minister Eric Lombard said Tuesday that it was against international law to seize assets in central banks. If Russian assets were seized without legal grounds, \"it could pose a risk to European financial stability,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cI advocate great caution when it comes to those frozen assets,\u201d Belgian Prime Minister Bart De Wever said at a March 6 EU summit. \u201cAt the moment, that is actually a chicken that also lays golden eggs. Those windfall profits are going to Ukraine.\"",
      "Opponents of seizure also fear that countries and investors would hesitate to use European financial institutions if they are afraid assets could be seized, undermining the euro's role as an international currency for state reserves.",
      "More specifically, governments worry that countries such as Saudi Arabia and China may sell European government bonds in response, said Elina Ribakova, an economist with the Bruegel think tank in Brussels. That would raise borrowing costs for governments already deep in debt.",
      "She favors seizure, however, arguing that the European Central Bank has tools to thwart any unjustified bond selloff by purchasing government bonds.",
      "Also looming over the issue are memories of the 2010-2012 European government debt crisis, in which borrowing costs spiked and raised concerns the euro currency could break up.",
      "There is a \u201cgood deal of PTSD in the EU around messing with the EU sovereign bond market\u201d because of that, said Tom Keatinge, director of the Centre for Finance and Security at the Royal United Services Institute in London.",
      "Some experts argue that seizure would be an appropriate \u201ccountermeasure.\u201d That's a specific legal term referring to an action that would normally be illegal but which is justified as a means to push Russia to stop its own violations of international law.",
      "\u201cThere is no dilemma between using an aggressor's assets to protect its victim and maintaining a commitment to the rules-based order,\u201d wrote Nigel Gould-Davies, senior fellow at the International Institute for Strategic Studies and Britain's former ambassador to Belarus, in a legal analysis.",
      "Other scholars say confiscation would not be a legitimate countermeasure.",
      "One reason: justifying a countermeasure as compensation for damages \u2014 instead of merely as pressure to behave \u2014 would be \u201ca very significant expansion of the way we have used countermeasures in the past,\" said Ingrid Brunk, professor of international law at Vanderbilt University Law School. \u201dI would term it as a violation of international law on countermeasures.\u201d",
      "Additionally, Brunk said international law grants strong protection to central bank reserves against seizure \u2014 a principle that has been \u201cabsolutely sacrosanct for a century.\u201d",
      "\u201cAt a time when countries agree on almost nothing, this is a widely, universally accepted rule,\u201d Brunk said, cautioning against \u201ddestabilizing one of the few ironclad bases for the international financial system.\u201d",
      "Keatinge said the legal question is a \u201c50-50 call.\u201d It boils down to a question of \u201cpolitical will.\"",
      "Frozen state assets were used to compensate victims of Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait and Iran's 1979 seizure of the U.S. Embassy in Tehran. Those actions were legally justified because they were part of post-conflict peace deals: a U.N. resolution in the case of Iraq, and by diplomatic accords in the case of Iran, noted Brunk.",
      "The Kremlin has repeatedly warned that the seizure of Russian assets would be illegitimate and erode investors\u2019 confidence. \u201cWe view those intentions as unlawful, and any attempt to fulfill them would entail very serious legal consequences,\u201d Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters earlier this month.",
      "Russia could, in theory, seize the assets of the estimated 1,800 Western companies that continue to do business in Russia. Recent legislation would enable state seizure of companies based in countries designated as \u201cunfriendly,\u201d Russian news media report.",
      "However, there's less to seize on Russia's end. Foreign companies have suffered more than $170 billion in losses since 2022, often as they decided to leave Russia or scale back there, according to the Kyiv School of Economics.",

      "He is one of the attorneys for Yulia Guryeva-Motlokhov, who claims she is the rightful owner of the Alfa Nero megayacht, which remained anchored off Antigua for a couple months before the local government seized and sold it last year.",
      "Browne did not immediately respond to a message for comment regarding the judge\u2019s ruling.",
      "The attorneys for Guryeva-Motlokhov alleged in a March 11 filing in federal court that Browne\u2019s administration has not released documents related to the $40 million sale of the yacht, once owned by Andrey Guryev, a Russian businessman who founded a fertilizer company and worked in the Russian government.",
      "He was sanctioned by the U.S. Treasury Department in August 2022, and the megayacht was removed from the sanctions list in June 2023 so Antigua could liquidate it.",
      "Antigua\u2019s opposition leaders also have demanded details of how the proceeds from the yacht sale were spent.",
      "Browne has said that details related to the yacht sale are public. On Sunday, he sent The Associated Press several documents he said showed those details.",
      "\u201cThis is irrefutable evidence that the claim that $10M is missing from the proceeds is a fabrication,\u201d he wrote in a message, referring to claims made in the March 11 filing.",
      "However, key information was redacted in bank payment/transfer forms that made it difficult to confirm details of the loans and advances.",
      "Browne also accused Guryeva-Motlokhov of defamation.",
      "In July 2024, Browne\u2019s wife, Maria Browne, Antigua\u2019s Minister of Housing, told The Antigua Observer newspaper that the proceeds were used to pay off government debt. Days before the report was published, the prime minister had said his administration was considering using the money to build a resort.",

      "President Donald Trump has signed into law legislation funding the government through the end of September",
      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump has signed into law legislation funding the government through the end of September, ending the threat of a partial government shutdown and capping off a struggle in Congress that deeply divided Democrats.",
      "Harrison Fields, White House principal deputy press secretary, said in a post on X that Trump signed the continuing resolution Saturday.",
      "The bill largely keeps government funding at levels set during Joe Biden's presidency, though with changes. It trims non-defense spending by about $13 billion from the previous year and increases defense spending by about $6 billion, which are marginal changes when talking about a topline spending level of nearly $1.7 trillion.",
      "The Senate cleared the legislation on Friday in a 54-46 party line vote, with 10 members of the Senate Democratic caucus helping the bill advance to passage despite opposition from within their party \u2014 most vocally from colleagues in the House, who exhorted them to reject the bill out of hand.",
      "Senate Democrats argued for days over whether to force a shutdown, livid that Republicans in the House had drafted and passed the spending measure without their input. Democrats said the legislation shortchanges health care, housing and other priorities and gives Trump wide leeway to redirect federal spending even as his administration and the Department of Government Efficiency rapidly dismantle congressionally approved agencies and programs.",
      "In the end, enough of the Democratic senators decided a government shutdown would be even worse than letting the funding bill pass.",
      "Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said a shutdown would have given the Trump administration the ability to deem whole agencies, programs and personnel non-essential, furloughing staff with no promise they would ever be rehired.",

      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump in recent days has dismissed fears of a recession and brushed aside the stock market sell-off, going so far as to say, \u201cYou can\u2019t really watch the stock market.\" That's a new message from a leader who has frequently pointed to the market's ups and downs as a reflection of himself and his activities, even when he was not in power.",
      "Over the last year, while President Joe Biden was in office, Trump took credit for stock market rallies as a vote of confidence in his electoral prospects. When the market dipped, he blamed Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris. And he predicted that if Democrats won the 2024 presidential election, the stock market would have crashed.",

      "On whether he thinks there will be a recession: \u201cI don't see it at all. I think this country's going to boom. But as I said, I can do it the easy way or the hard way. The hard way to do it is exactly what I'm doing, but the results are going to be 20 times greater. Remember, Trump is always right.\u201d",

      "LOS ANGELES -- They have run through heartache and grief, battling illnesses and injuries as their bodies have aged. Some are now using wheelchairs, including the oldest who is 87.",
      "Despite it all, the Los Angeles Marathon's Legacy Runners have stuck to their mission: finish the race.",
      "On Sunday, the group of 92 marathoners, including 10 women, marked their 40th LA Marathon, participating in the 26.2-mile (42.2-kilometer) race every year since the city's iconic event began in 1986.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re legacy runners, we just don\u2019t know when to quit,\u201d 77-year-old Lou Briones said.",
      "Briones even has finished the race on crutches after surgery. Since getting both knees replaced, he walks the race.",
      "\u201cYou gotta do it,\u201d Briones said. \u201cNo matter what the conditions are, you gotta be there at the starting line on race day.\u201d",
      "When Briones and others gathered at the starting line for the first LA marathon, President Ronald Reagan had just been reelected and few weeks prior the Space Shuttle Challenger exploded, shocking the country. Tom Bradley was serving as the first Black mayor of Los Angeles and the city was grappling with the spread of HIV/AIDS.",
      "Los Angeles was inspired to start its own marathon after the success of hosting the 1984 Summer Olympic Games, much like the beginning of the Boston Marathon in 1897 after the first marathon competition was held in the 1896 Summer Olympics. Los Angeles is now preparing to host its next Olympics in 2028.",
      "Five years after the LA Marathon started, event organizers began recognizing runners who had completed every race with a plaque. They continued to hold celebrations for the dedicated runners every five years.",
      "Around the 15th year, Briones decided he wanted to formalize the group. He and a friend printed out stickers with an email address and brought them to the marathon in 2002.",
      "\u201cWe went to the race and we just started yelling out,\u201d Briones said. \u201cWe\u2019d stick it right on their bib, and then after the race, most of them immediately sent an email. That was the beginning.\u201d",
      "Some Legacy Runners said they were inspired by U.S. runner Joan Benoit, who won the first Olympic women\u2019s marathon at the 1984 Los Angeles Games.",
      "May DuBois, 80, remembers watching the race on TV and seeing Benoit finish far ahead of the rest of the pack of runners. A classical pianist, she had never run in her life.",
      "Two years later, DuBois ran the same path as Benoit \u2014 starting and ending at the Memorial Coliseum \u2014 since back then, the LA Marathon route was the same as the Olympics. She said it felt just \u201clike running in the Olympics with everybody cheering us on.\u201d",
      "Now, she can\u2019t imagine going a day without running 3 to 5 miles (4.8 to 8 km).",
      "\u201cI\u2019m healthy, I look good, and I don\u2019t get tired. I never get sick, I don\u2019t even catch colds,\u201d said DuBois, who hosts a brunch to celebrate after each marathon.",
      "Each year, Legacy Runners are given the same bib number. They start meeting monthly for training about six months before the marathon.",
      "Cliff Housego, 76, started running after his father died at 48 from a heart attack. He decided he wanted to live long enough to see his grandchildren and even great-grandchildren.",
      "Over the years, Housego has gone through two divorces and lost his daughter. Through it all, the marathon has been a constant in his life.",
      "\u201cMany, many things could\u2019ve stopped me from being there,\u201d Housego said.",
      "At 83, Sharon Kerson realizes that, too.",
      "After a year of dealing with sickness and vertigo, Kerson completed her training last week at the West Los Angeles College track, the same place she first started running more than 40 years ago. She has run more than 600 marathons.",
      "She wore a rain jacket from the St. George Marathon in Utah, shorts from the San Francisco Marathon and a T-shirt from the 30th LA Marathon.",
      "\u201cI never was fast and I\u2019m not competitive at all,\u201d Kerson said, adding that her only goal each time is to finish.",
      "Rick Bingham began racing in a wheelchair a decade ago after injuring his Achilles tendon during a triathlon. At 87, he swims half a mile (0.8 kilometer) every other day and lifts weights. To train, he went 5 miles (8 kilometers) one day around his ranch in a wheelchair.",
      "Bingham has no plans to slow down. He wants to reach his 50th LA Marathon.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ll only be 97 when I do that,\u201d he said.",
      "Bingham's commitment to remaining in the race has inspired Luis Gallardo to continue.",

      "\u201cWe went through too many things over the years, too many hardships,\u201d Gallardo said. \u201cTo do it with him is just a blessing.\u201d",

      "A transformation of women\u2019s soccer in Europe is well under way",
      "UMEA, Sweden -- Sprinkled around its small, shared office are trophies and mementos signifying the not-so-distant glory days of Swedish women\u2019s soccer team Ume\u00e5 IK.",
      "On one wall is the No. 60 jersey worn by its greatest ever player, Brazil superstar Marta. Across the corridor is a bookcase crammed with European and Swedish silverware and medals. Gathering dust in the corner of a room nearby is a trophy for the 2003 UEFA Women\u2019s Cup, the precursor to the Champions League.",
      "Indeed, it\u2019s only 21 years ago that the team from this small northern city virtually unknown outside Sweden was a back-to-back European champion.",
      "Now Ume\u00e5 is adjusting to its new status in women\u2019s soccer \u2014 languishing in Sweden\u2019s second division, playing before average attendances of around 400 spectators, and battling debts.",
      "A transformation of the women\u2019s game in Europe is well under way. As attendance figures and TV ratings rise, big-money clubs already well established in men\u2019s soccer \u2013 think Barcelona, Real Madrid, Chelsea \u2013 are taking over the show.",
      "Ume\u00e5 is among the unfashionable clubs of yesteryear who know they can no longer compete.",
      "\u201cNot to be harsh or anything, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s possible anymore,\u201d Ume\u00e5 coach Edvin Erfanian said about the club\u2019s chances of returning to the top of the European game. \u201cBut I don\u2019t necessarily see it as a bad thing. The product of women\u2019s football is a whole lot better than it was 20 years ago.\u201d",
      "The changing face of women\u2019s European soccer is best illustrated by comparing the lineup of the Champions League quarterfinals taking place this week to that of 20 years ago.",
      "On Tuesday, it\u2019s Real Madrid vs. Arsenal and Bayern Munich vs. Lyon. On Wednesday, it\u2019s Wolfsburg vs. Barcelona and Manchester City vs. Chelsea.",
      "Rewind to the 2004-05 season and the quarterfinalists included Bobruichanka Bobruisk (Belarus), Energy Voronezh (Russia), Trondheims-\u00d8rn (Norway), Turbine Potsdam (Germany), Torres (Italy), as well as Djurg\u00e5rden/\u00c4lvsj\u00f6 and defending champion Ume\u00e5 from Sweden.",
      "Arsenal, a rare example of a top men\u2019s club that also had a strong women\u2019s team in those days, is the only quarterfinalist from 20 years ago that remains competitive in the Women\u2019s Champions League today.",
      "The contrast in resources is considerable.",
      "Barcelona, the reigning European champion, generated 17.9 million euros ($19.5 million) in revenue in 2023-24, according to analysis from accountancy firm Deloitte. J\u00f6rgen Crovin, Ume\u00e5\u2019s sporting manager, estimates that Ume\u00e5\u2019s revenue last year was about $800,000.",
      "Ume\u00e5 IK is a club located around 400 kilometers (250 miles) from the Arctic Circle \u2014 the winters here are long and cold \u2014 and in a quiet university town populated by 130,000. The team has been surviving year-to-year, even week-to-week as recently as last November when a last-gasp crowdfunding campaign and donations from wealthy locals raised enough cash to keep the team afloat.",
      "Expectations and targets have been realigned. Being European champion again is a pipe dream for a squad containing many students and only three full-time professionals. Crovin joined in 2022 and says the players brought in during his time have all been free transfers. Chelsea, meanwhile, just made U.S. defender Naomi Girma the world's first million-dollar female player.",
      "Instead, returning to Sweden's top division and consolidating with a strong youth system and robust finances, while serving as a pipeline for the best players in the north of the country, is the best Ume\u00e5's soccer leadership can realistically hope for these days.",
      "\u201cWe just need to find our own way,\u201d Erfanian, a 28-year-old coach, told the AP. \u201cWe don\u2019t have the finances and, in the end, that\u2019s what it\u2019s about. ... For us, what we need to do is put our resources in the academy and create a good environment for young girls in the north part of Sweden.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s very different to the early years of this century when women\u2019s soccer wasn\u2019t such big business and Ume\u00e5 was a benchmark in the European game.",
      "In lore in these parts is the cold, gray day in February 2004 when an 18-year-old Marta, reportedly wearing flip-flops, arrived in Ume\u00e5 from Belo Horizonte with her cousin, Marina, and threw a snowball for the first time in her life. Within months, Marta was scoring in both legs of the Champions League final against FFC Frankfurt as Ume\u00e5 retained the title before losing the 2007 and \u201908 finals \u2014 by which time she was the Ballon d\u2019Or winner.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s pretty much a different world up there \u2014 really small place, really cold \u2014 and she adapted,\u201d Johanna Frisk, a teammate of Marta\u2019s at Ume\u00e5 and now a pundit for Swedish broadcaster Viaplay, told the AP. \u201cHer skills were on another level. She could do pretty much anything.\u201d",
      "Ume\u00e5 was a \u201cwinning machine,\u201d Frisk said. For Crovin, the club \u201craised the bar\u201d in terms of how much they trained and the ambition they had in using their money, pumped into the club from local and national businesses, to buy foreign players.",
      "\u201cUme\u00e5 was ahead of its time,\u201d Crovin said in an interview in a cluttered office the club now shares with the city\u2019s indoor floor hockey team.",
      "Sponsors started to leave and debts started to build for Ume\u00e5. Marta left after the 2008 season and the team hasn\u2019t won a major title since.",
      "Around that time, Europe\u2019s powerhouse clubs started taking women\u2019s soccer seriously. Paris Saint-Germain won its first major women's title in 2010 and soon was fueled by cash from the men\u2019s team\u2019s Qatari ownership. Barcelona won its first Spanish women's league title in 2011. Bayern Munich, which wasn\u2019t in Germany\u2019s top women's league during much of the 1990s, started winning cups and leagues in the 2010s. Manchester United\u2019s women's team was reformed in 2018, having been disbanded in 2005. Real Madrid\u2019s women\u2019s team was founded in 2020.",
      "With resources, infrastructure and a brand name behind them, the big-name women\u2019s teams are flourishing. Even in Sweden, Malm\u00f6 \u2014 the biggest men's club \u2014 relaunched a women's team in 2019 that just got promoted to the top division.",
      "According to a Deloitte report, the 15 top revenue-generating women\u2019s clubs whose financial results were available for analysis brought in more than 100 million euros (dollars) combined for the first time during the 2023-24 season, a year-on-year growth of 35%.",
      "\u201cInvesting in women\u2019s football is proving to be a good business decision, benefitting both brand recognition and the business models of football clubs,\u201d Jennifer Haskel, knowledge and insight lead in Deloitte's sports business group, said.",
      "It seems the best way to be a strong, financially sound women's team is to be linked to a successful men's club \u2014 or have an owner with deep pockets.",
      "Crovin says there are no immediate plans for Ume\u00e5 to be affiliated with the city's men's team, which also plays in the second tier in Sweden and doesn't have so strong a brand.",
      "Similarly in Germany, Turbine Potsdam \u2014 the Champions League winner in 2005 and \u201810 based outside Berlin \u2014 has slumped as hard as old rival Ume\u00e5 amid the changing financial landscape. It's also an independent women\u2019s team, with a recent co-operation with the Hertha Berlin men\u2019s team lasting only three years.",
      "Demoted in 2023 after 26 years in Germany's top division and now battling to avoid a return to the second tier after promotion last year, Turbine has struggled to bring through enough talented young players in recent years to get close to competing with powers like Bayern and Bayer Leverkusen.",
      "\u201cWe need money,\u201d Turbine president Karsten Ritter-Lang told the AP. \u201cIt\u2019s really, really difficult to find sponsors ... I\u2019m absolutely sure if we have enough money and we develop our sports school system, then it will be possible to be successful as an isolated women\u2019s football club.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "It is time: Millions of Americans are going through the annual March rite of filling out an NCAA Tournament bracket (or two or three)",
      "INDIANAPOLIS -- When Bryce Yoder needs a study break this time of year, the college student flips on a TV and attends his favorite March Madness class \u2014 bracket science.",
      "The 19-year-old sports management major at Indiana University-Indianapolis studies hard to learn the secrets of picking winners in the nearly dozen NCAA Tournament bracket pools he hopes to enter before Thursday's first-round games. It takes time, patience and some lucky bounces to get those picks right.",
      "Yoder is hardly alone. Millions of Americans \u2014 from hard-core sports junkies to casual fans and school alumni to those with no rooting interest \u2014 engage in this annual national pastime by filling out a tourney bracket and seeing how they fare. Winning is possible, though few hold out much hope of a perfect bracket: The NCAA says the odds of that are 1 in 9,223,372,036,854,775,808 if you wing it and a still-absurd 1 in 120.2 billion if you know a bit about hoops.",
      "For players like Yoder, it\u2019s more about proving he\u2019s the best.",
      "\u201cThe satisfaction of being right,\u201d he said in explaining why he fills out so many brackets. \u201cReally, it\u2019s about having the best bracket possible, whether that\u2019s with my friends and family or just the leaderboard over a random bunch of people that I\u2019ve never met. I\u2019m just so competitive.\u201d",
      "From online gambling to office pools to family contests, brackets are big business and a big distraction. A study released in 2023 by Challenger, Gray & Christmas, a work outplacement firm, estimated $17.3 billion is lost in productivity during the three-week tourney. A Finance Buzz survey back then also found 36% of employees tune into the games during work hours, and nearly 25% use paid time off or sick days.",
      "Even elective surgery companies now advertise that customers can have mid-March procedures so they can recover \u2014 and watch basketball \u2014 at the same time.",
      "It seems almost unfathomable today, but brackets meant virtually nothing for about the first 50 years of the NCAA tourney, which dates to 1939 and this year is holding its 86th edition.",
      "During the '70s, though, the changes began in earnest.",
      "The NCAA tourney expanded from 25 to 32 teams in 1975, the first year leagues could send two teams. Seeding started in 1978, and the field grew to 40 in 1979 and to 48 in 1980 when organizers dropped the restriction on how many league teams could play.",
      "But the real revolution really with the 1979 title game between Michigan State and Indiana State. That Magic Johnson-Larry Bird matchup drew a 24.1 television rating, still the tourney record, and it gave everyone a glimpse into what college basketball's biggest event could become at the same time an 8-year-old boy named Charlie Creme looked into his future.",
      "\u201cI cut the (men's) bracket out of the newspaper in 1979 and had it on the pantry door in my family's kitchen,\" said Creme, now ESPN's women's basketball bracketologist. \u201cI was filling it out, making actual predictions and I couldn't wait till a game ended and I could run up to the pantry door and advance the next team in the tournament. Within a couple years, I was making my own brackets with big pieces of oak tag (paper) and a pencil and a ruler.\u201d",
      "Soon, he'd have company as the tourney grew.",
      "America's first all-sports network, ESPN, broadcast the 16 first-round games, 12 on tape delay, in 1980. CBS wrested the broadcast rights away from NBC in 1982 with a three-year deal for $16 million annually and the promise of expanded coverage including the first televised selection show.",
      "Suddenly, brackets mattered and broadcasters such as Dick Vitale stoked long debates over which teams belonged, which did not and who would win games. Live, daily telecasts on ESPN spurred interest, too, heading into 1985, the first 64-team field and introduced a future NCAA executive to fill out the bracket.",
      "\u201cThe first one I remember filling out was 1985,\u201d said Dan Gavitt, the son of Big East co-founder Dave Gavitt and now the NCAA senior vice president for basketball. \u201cI had four Big East teams in the Final Four and I was right on three of them. Boston College got beat by Memphis in in the regional finals.\u201d",
      "Gavitt, like Creme, was hooked and brackets became fashionable.",
      "Could it happen again on the women's side? Perhaps.",
      "After seeing ticket sales, television ratings and coverage of the sport soar in the last few years with more to come thanks to stars such as Paige Bueckers, Hannah Hidalgo and JuJu Watkins, Creme thinks women's brackets are on a similar trajectory.",
      "\u201cWe might be seeing 1985-95,\u201d Creme said. \u201cStar players in the men's game back then, stuck around longer. Right now we're in that period where Caitlin Clark played four years in college and as the rules stand now, JuJu Watkins has to play four years and Paige could if she wanted \u2014 she's not going to \u2014 but could stick around another year. That's where the men's game was in that period.\u201d",
      "In its infancy, the bracket phenomenon was geared to teenagers and college students like Yoder who watched multiple games.",
      "Soon, office pools and games among family members with entry fees and prize money became popular, too. In some cases, all you did was pluck a name out of a hat.",
      "Back then, the NCAA frowned on such practices, labeling it gambling. Today, the NCAA runs its own online bracket game as part of its \u201cfan engagement.\u201d",
      "Still, the prize pool only fueled interest. So did the 1980s national championship games that became must-see TV \u2014 and the upset factor.",
      "From surprising title runs by North Carolina State in 1983 and Villanova in 1985 to Princeton's near-upset of Georgetown in 1989, it seemed every team was in the mix and nobody would pick all the winners.",
      "\u201cThere will never be a perfect bracket,\u201d ESPN men's basketball bracketologist Joe Lunardi said. \u201cThat's just not going to happen. When Warren Buffet offered $10 million for perfect bracket, he knew he wasn't going to pay that out.\"",
      "Those daunting odds haven't stopped anyone from filling out brackets.",
      "\u201cIf I feel really strongly about a game, I'll probably pick the same outcome more times than not,\u201d Yoder said, referring to how he handles multiple brackets. \u201cBut I try to throw some silly type of stuff that wouldn't necessarily have a good chance of happening, like upsets, because that's just naturally going to happen.\u201d",
      "Figuring out how to pick teams and games has evolved the years.",
      "Selection committee members use tangible measures such as wins and losses, strength of schedule and NET rankings to round out the 68-team field. Other measures include quad victories, which vary in how they're compiled and applied. In an era of analytics, sites such as kenpom.com have become regular components for hard-core and casual fans.",
      "The NCAA certainly is paying attention.",
      "Gavitt said he filled out brackets in the early years of the NET just to see how reliable the rankings were to results And when the topic of expansion is broached, NCAA officials look to see how the potential new bracket would fit on a single printed page.",
      "The question, of course, is how far can this go and whether artificial intelligence can become the next big thing when it comes to picking winners.",
      "\u201cIf AI did it, then the analysis would not be as much fun or as interesting,\u201d Creme said. \"I don't know that the NCAA would ever go that far. I kind of hope not because I like the human element. If it's eliminated, if we know the AI formula, then it's sort of over.\"",

      "\u201cWe have offered more markets and more games than ever before, which could explain some of our continuing success,\u201d Luther said. \u201cAnother factor has been the increased visibility of the sport through TV and media coverage and more players with major endorsement deals.\u201d",

      "The value of the Japanese yen has fallen drastically in relation to the dollar in the last 2 1/2 years. That means it has become very expensive for Japanese to travel to the United States. The yen buys fewer and fewer dollars, making American prices seem very high for Japanese. Conversely, tourists with dollars find Japan affordable.",

      "Trying to prove the real inventor of the March Madness pool seems about as implausible as picking a perfect bracket",
      "NEW YORK -- Could it really be true? That of all of college basketball\u2019s urban myths, one of New York\u2019s five boroughs is actually the birthplace of filling out an NCAA Tournament bracket?",
      "Before all those office pools truly defined March, betting the bracket was the supposed brainchild of an Irish pub owner in Staten Island \u2014 a \u201ccreative businessman,\u201d his son calls him \u2014 whose straightforward idea of plunking down 10 bucks to pick the Final Four teams and the national champion turned the unassuming spot into a bustling attraction where the special of the day could be a million-dollar payout.",
      "\u201cWe created a pool that just blew up over time,\u201d current bar owner Terence Haggerty said. \u201cLooking back at it now, how did we pull it off? How did we do it? It was crazy.\u201d",
      "Through the decades of Larry and Magic, of Jordan and Laettner, through word of mouth and an embarrassment of riches the contest took off \u2014 so much so that the West Brighton neighborhood favorite, Jody\u2019s Club Forest, stakes its claim (though not without at least one other contender to the crown) as the bar that helped ignite the bracket into a billion-dollar business.",
      "Haggerty\u2019s parents, Mary and Jody, opened the club in 1976, and by the next college basketball season, already had hatched the idea of running a college basketball pool to boost business. The rules were simple: pay $10 to pick only the Final Four teams, the national champ and total points as a tiebreaker in a winner-take-all format. The tournament field of 32 teams \u2014 no need to fill a line for every round \u2014 was dwarfed by the 88 total entries, with the winner netting $880.",
      "By the time Jody\u2019s Club shut down the pool in 2006, under scrutiny from everyone from the IRS to Sports Illustrated, the jackpot was a whopping $1.6 million to the winner.",
      "\u201cWe never in a million years would have ever imagined where it got,\u201d Terence Haggerty said.",
      "Every March needs a Cinderella, and Jody\u2019s Forest Club can punch its ticket as an originator in gambling-related contests.",
      "But in the home of bourbon, basketball and the Louisville Slugger, could the idea of penciling in a winner for every line have taken its first swing in 1970s Kentucky?",
      "Bob Stinson, who died at 68 in 2018, was a U.S. Postal Service worker who applied the idea of using his recreational softball league bracket and the furor over Kentucky Derby betting slips to create his own bracket for the 1978 NCAA Tournament.",
      "\u201cMy dad just thought it would be fun to fill out the brackets,\u201d said his son, Damon Stinson. \u201cIt was kind of a betting thing but not really. It was kind of a who knows college basketball better kind of thing.\u201d",
      "Stinson said his father used a ruler and unlined paper to sketch out brackets and required only a nominal entry fee. The winner earned more bragging rights than a life-changing bonanza, though that was just fine with Bob Stinson, who traveled around the country for his job and brought brackets with him every March.",
      "\u201cHe was proud of it,\u201d Damon said. \u201cInstead of just watching the games, let\u2019s fill this out. He self-promoted the idea. He was tech savvy back in the day. So when Excel came out, the first thing my dad did was build a tournament bracket off it. This was perfect. He really had the first bracket pool electronically that anybody had, and he emailed it to everybody. That\u2019s how it grew into a much bigger pool and things got out of hand.\u201d",
      "Damon Stinson says he once almost got thrown out of Catholic school for peddling brackets to other students for $10 each and was caught with $350 and a \u201cbunch of brackets in my backpack.\u201d",
      "Trying to prove the real inventor of the March Madness pool seems as implausible as, well, picking a perfect bracket.",
      "Stinson said his father truly believed, though, he made the first one.",
      "\u201cYes, 100%. Because he traveled for work, nobody had seen what he was doing,\u201d Stinson said. \u201cHe traveled a lot nationally around the same time he was coming up with the idea and spreading it. He truly believed. The true 1-64, we\u2019re going to write them down, we\u2019re going to go round-by-round, that literal format is what he started with.\u201d",
      "There is not a shred of acknowledgment at Jody\u2019s Club that it was ever a hub for basketball bets. No banner outside, no photos of past winners or framed snapshots of winning tickets. The decor is mostly an homage to Haggerty\u2019s parents, who raised their kids about 12 blocks away.",
      "Haggerty conceded there\u2019s no real proof the bar was the first spot to run an organized pool.",
      "\u201cIf somebody said, \u2018No, it\u2019s mine,\u2019 go right ahead,\u201d Haggerty said. \u201cLook around here. It\u2019s not something we really promote. It\u2019s not how we were. It\u2019s not how my father was. It\u2019s definitely not how my mother was. If I celebrated that, I wouldn\u2019t feel right doing it.\u201d",
      "Haggerty has no record of ticket winners \u2014 not even of the $1.6 million jackpot \u2014 but on a recent trip to the pub, a past champion had a barstool seat, a pint and a pining for his share of a six-figure payout won in 2003. Jack Driscoll said he played nearly every year during the life of the pool and recalled the thrill of placing that first bet each March.",
      "\u201cThe cutoff day for submitting tickets was as big as any other holiday around here,\u201d he said.",
      "Driscoll struck it big when Syracuse won the national championship. He used the windfall to invest in home improvements, notably a new kitchen.",
      "The real March Madness at the Club was figuring out where to stuff piles and piles of cash. No ordinary cash register would hold the hundreds, then thousands, and \u2014 twice! \u2014 millions wagered in the pool. The family once asked a nun to hold a hefty wad of collections.",
      "\u201cIt was sprinkled here, sprinkled there, a little bit of everywhere,\u201d Haggerty said. \u201cBanks. It was hidden in houses at some point. It was quite the operation.\u201d",
      "The pool was essentially a mom-and-pop business, and it took days in its beginning in an era without fast and reliable computers to enter all the picks. The lines to buy a ticket \u2014 firefighters, police officers, elected officials and even Mike and the Mad Dog, Haggerty said \u2014 snaked down the street. Haggerty said ticket collection was forced into a neighboring dry cleaner and even other local bars to ease the congestion and give everyone a fair shot at playing.",
      "\u201cIt was the best week of the year,\u201d Haggerty said.",
      "The jackpot swelled to about $997,000 in 2004 and topped $1.2 million the following year \u2014 again, much like in that first 1977 pool, the entry fee remained $10, cash only \u2014 before it stretched to 166,000 entries and a $1.6 million prize in 2006.",
      "Thanks in large part to the swelling media attention, the numbers raised a red flag in the federal government. After the winner supposedly claimed the winnings on a tax form, the IRS came knocking on Jody\u2019s Club door. The bar was in the clear for the pool \u2014 no one skimmed off the top, and the bar never profited from the seasonal business \u2014 but the IRS found Jody Haggerty had underreported his income over three years. Haggerty pleaded guilty to tax-evasion charges, received probation and was forced to pay restitution.",
      "The charges were the fatal blow to Jody\u2019s slice of March Madness.",
      "Embarrassed by the notoriety, Jody Haggerty shut down the pool for good ahead of the 2007 tournament. Jody Haggerty died in 2016 without another March bet placed in the pub.",
      "\u201cPart of it killed my father, I felt like,\u201d the 42-year-old Haggerty said of the investigation. \u201cMy father was really never the same after it.\u201d",
      "Even after his mother\u2019s death in 2019, Haggerty never had any serious thoughts of restarting the pool.",
      "\u201cWhat we were put through was horrible,\u201d Haggerty said. \u201cBut if I did it, I think it would skyrocket right away.\u201d",
      "Jody\u2019s Club Forest remains a destination each March for basketball junkies who know of the bars\u2019 role \u2014 was it really the first? Does it even matter? \u2014 in making betting pools and the art of bracketology an integral part of March Madness.",
      "\u201cWe started something that nobody\u2019s come close to since,\u201d Haggerty said.",

      "After Indiana won five of its last seven games in the regular season to get in the mix, the bubble burst after losing to Oregon in its only Big Ten Tournament game.",
      "The 66-year-old Woodson, who has been under fire most of the past two years, announced in February that he was stepping down at his alma mater at the end of the season. The Hoosiers missed the NCAAs last season after making it in his first two seasons, then ending their first stretch of four missed NCAAs in a row since 1968-72.",
      "Boise State (24-10) made it to the Mountain West Conference Tournament championship game, but wasn\u2019t one of the league\u2019s four teams that moved on to the NCAA Tournament. Colorado State got the league\u2019s automatic berth with 69-56 win over the Broncos in the title game.",
      "The Broncos had been to the NCAA Tournament the past three seasons, and 15th-season coach Leon Rice spoke after the MWC title game about his team's continued aggressive scheduling and \u201cgreat wins\u201d this season over Clemson and Saint Mary's. He also lamented how the selection committee might look at a single loss in November at the end of an early-season tournament.",
      "\u201cSo because, on the third day of a tournament, Boston College hits a step-back 3 to beat us, does that mean we\u2019re not tournament-worthy?

      "\u201cObviously, we are extremely shocked, saddened and disappointed with not being selected for the NCAA Tournament,\" first-year Mountaineers coach Darian DeVries said. \u201cWe strongly believe that we have a resume that is worthy of an NCAA Tournament team.\"",
      "The Mountaineers played much of the season without the coach's son, 6-foot-7 Tucker DeVries, who averaged 14.9 points and 4.9 rebounds in his eight starts before an upper-body injury that required surgery. The father-son duo came from Drake, where Tucker DeVries was a two-time Missouri Valley Conference player of the year.",
      "Bubba Cunningham, the North Carolina athletic director who is chairman of the NCAA Tournament selection committee, referenced DeVries' injury when talking about the first four teams left out.",
      "\u201cThe last four teams that were out for, it was a tough call. The next team out was West Virginia and they had an outstanding year and unfortunately knowing Tucker DeVries was hurt, player availability is something that we talk about quite a bit,\u201d Cunningham said during the Selection Show. \u201cIndiana was close, Ohio State was close, Boise was close.\u201d",
      "On Monday, West Virginia Gov. Patrick Morrisey said he has asked his attorney general to investigate and work closely with the NCAA to ensure that the tournament selection process is transparent and fair.",
      "Ohio State had six Quad I wins like West Virginia, but the Buckeyes lost five of their last seven games and missed the NCAA Tournament for the third consecutive season. The last time they did that was 2003-05.",
      "Wake Forest (21-11) turned down playing in the 32-team National Invitation Tournament after recently marking the 25th anniversary of its 2000 NIT championship.",
      "The Demon Deacons haven't made the NCAA field since 2017, but athletic director John Currie touted their 13-7 record in the Atlantic Coast Conference for a fourth-place finish that was their best since 2009. He also noted their 86 wins over the past four seasons, after averaging only 12 wins the previous 11 years.",
      "\u201cI deeply respect how difficult it is for the members of the NCAA Tournament selection committee to choose from 332 teams for just 37 at-large spots,\" Currie said. \"The embedded principles which enabled six teams who finished at below .500 in their conferences to take 16% of those at-large spots don\u2019t make sense to me.\u201d",

      "CAPE TOWN, South Africa -- A member of a South African research team that is confined for more than a year at an isolated Antarctica base was put under psychological evaluation there after he allegedly assaulted and sexually harassed colleagues, government officials said.",
      "The problems at the SANAE IV base were first reported by South Africa's Sunday Times newspaper, which said it had seen an email from a team member to authorities last month claiming the man had attacked the base leader and made threats.",
      "The email pleaded for help.",
      "\u201cHis behavior has escalated to a point that is deeply disturbing,\u201d the email said, according to The Sunday Times. \u201cI remain deeply concerned about my own safety, constantly wondering if I might become the next victim.\u201d The report said the man allegedly made a death threat.",
      "South Africa\u2019s Ministry of Environment, which oversees the research missions, said in a statement Monday night that the alleged assault on the base leader was reported on Feb. 27, and officials and counselors intervened remotely \u201cto mediate and restore relationships at the base.\u201d They were speaking with team members almost daily, it said.",
      "\u201cThe alleged perpetrator has willingly participated in further psychological evaluation, has shown remorse and is willingly cooperative,\u201d the ministry said, adding that he had written a formal apology to the victim of the alleged assault. It said the allegations were being investigated. No one was identified.",
      "The nine-member team, which includes scientists, a doctor and engineers, is expected to stay at the base for about 13 months until next year, authorities said, living in close quarters through the hostile Antarctic winter, whose six months of darkness begin in June.",
      "The base is on a cliff in Queen Maud Land and is surrounded by a glacial ice sheet, more than 4,000 kilometers (2,485 miles) from South Africa.",
      "The next planned visit by a supply ship is in December, according to the South African National Antarctic Program. It takes the ship around 10 days to travel from Cape Town.",
      "Authorities said they had decided not to evacuate anyone from SANAE IV, where the onset of unpredictable weather conditions meant the team was now confined to the base.",
      "The ministry said all team members had undergone evaluations ahead of the trip to ensure they are able to cope with the \u201cextreme nature of the environment in Antarctica\u201d and the isolation and confinement, and no problems were identified.",
      "\u201cIt is not uncommon that once individuals arrive at the extremely remote areas where the scientific bases are located, an initial adjustment to the environment is required,\u201d it said.",
      "Previous problems have been reported at another of South Africa's remote research bases on Marion Island, a South African territory near Antarctica.",
      "In 2017, a member of a research team there smashed a colleague's room with an ax over an apparent love triangle, according to a report to South Africa's Parliament. Lawmakers said it appeared the researchers were living in highly stressful conditions.",
      "The National Science Foundation, the federal agency that oversees the U.S. Antarctic Program, published a report in 2022 in which 59% of women in the U.S. program said they\u2019d experienced harassment or assault while on research trips in Antarctica.",

      "CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. -- CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) \u2014 Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams were barely known outside space circles when they strapped in for what was supposed to be a quick test flight of Boeing's Starliner capsule last June. Nine months later, they've captured the world's attention \u2014 and hearts \u2014 as NASA's stuck astronauts.",
      "Their homecoming is imminent now that a new crew has arrived at the International Space Station to replace them after launching from Florida last week. They'll fly back with SpaceX as soon as Tuesday, their problem-plagued Starliner having returned to Earth empty months ago, leaving them behind in orbit.",
      "Here's a look at \u201cSuni and Butch\u201d and their drama-filled mission:",
      "The two test pilots came to NASA via the Navy. Wilmore, 62, played high school and college football in his home state of Tennessee before joining the Navy. Williams, 59, grew up in Needham, Massachusetts, a competitive swimmer and distance runner.",
      "Wilmore racked up 663 aircraft carrier landings, while Williams served in combat helicopter squadrons.",
      "NASA picked Williams as an astronaut in 1998 followed by Wilmore in 2000. Each had two spaceflights behind them including monthslong stints at the space station before signing up as Starliner's first crew.",
      "While they accepted their repeated homecoming delays, they noted it was much harder on their families. Wilmore\u2019s wife Deanna has held down the fort, according to her husband. Their oldest daughter is in college and their youngest in her last year of high school.",
      "Williams\u2019 husband, Mike, a retired federal marshal, has been caring for their two Labrador retrievers. She said her mother is the worrier.",
      "Besides reuniting with loved ones, Wilmore, an elder with his Baptist church, can\u2019t wait to get back to face-to-face ministering and smelling fresh-cut grass.",
      "Wilmore kept in touch with members of his congregation over the months, taking part in occasional prayer services and calling ailing members via the space station's internet phone.",
      "Williams looks forward to long walks with her dogs and an ocean swim.",
      "Several other astronauts have spent even longer in space so no special precautions should be needed for these two once they're back, according to NASA.",
      "\u201cEvery astronaut that launches into space, we teach them don't think about when you're coming home. Think about how well your mission's going and if you're lucky, you might get to stay longer,\u201d NASA's space operations mission chief and former astronaut Ken Bowersox said last week.",
      "Wilmore and Williams found themselves in the middle of a political storm when President Donald Trump and SpaceX founder Elon Musk announced at the end of January they would accelerate the astronauts' return and blamed the Biden Administration on keeping them up there too long.",
      "NASA officials stood by their decision to wait for the next scheduled SpaceX flight to bring them home, targeting a February return. But their replacements got held up back on Earth because of battery work on their brand new SpaceX capsule.",
      "SpaceX switched capsules to speed things up, moving up their return by a couple of weeks. The two will come back in the capsule that's been up there since last fall.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s great to see how much people care about our astronauts,\u201d Bowersox said, describing the pair as \u201cprofessional, devoted, committed, really outstanding.\u201d",
      "Astronauts almost always fly back in the same spacecraft they launched in. Wilmore and Williams launched aboard Boeing's Starliner and will return in SpaceX's Dragon.",
      "Their first flights were aboard NASA's space shuttle, followed by Russia's Soyuz capsule. Both the Starliner and Dragon are completely autonomous but capable of manual command if necessary.",
      "As test pilots, they were in charge of the Starliner. The Dragon had fellow astronaut Nick Hague in command; he launched in it last September with a Russian and two empty seats reserved for Wilmore and Williams.",
      "Starliner almost didn't make it to the space station. Soon after the June 5 liftoff, helium leaked and thrusters malfunctioned on the way to the orbiting lab.",
      "NASA and Boeing spent the summer trying to figure out what went wrong and whether the problems would repeat on the flight back, endangering its two test pilots. NASA ultimately decided it was too risky and ordered the capsule back empty in September.",
      "Engineers are still investigating the thruster breakdowns, and it's unclear when Starliner will fly again \u2014 with astronauts or just cargo. NASA went into its commercial crew program wanting two competing U.S. companies for taxi service for redundancy's sake and stand by that choice.",

      "A new study out Monday finds that even in the most optimistic scenarios, grass-fed beef is no less carbon-intensive than industrial beef",
      "For cattle fattened in fields instead of feedlots, the grass may be greener, but the carbon emissions are not.",
      "A study out Monday in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences finds that even in the most optimistic scenarios, grass-fed beef produces no less planet-warming carbon emissions than industrial beef. The finding calls into question the frequent promotion of grass-fed beef as a more environmentally friendly option. Still, other scientists say grass-fed beef wins out on other factors like animal welfare or local environmental pollution, complicating the choice for conscientious consumers.",
      "\u201cI think that there is a large portion of the population who really do wish their purchasing decisions will reflect their values,\u201d said Gidon Eshel, a research professor of environmental physics at Bard College and one of the study's authors. \u201cBut they are being misled, essentially, by the wrong information.\u201d",
      "When it comes to food, beef contributes by far the most emissions fueling climate change and is one of the most resource- and land-intensive to produce. Yet demand for beef around the world is only expected to grow. And carefully weighing the benefits of grass-fed beef matters because in most parts of the world where beef production is expanding, such as South America, it\u2019s being done by deforesting land that would otherwise store carbon, said Richard Waite of the World Resources Institute.",
      "Experts say this study's finding makes sense because it's less efficient to produce grass-fed cattle than their industrial counterparts. Animals that are fattened up in fields instead of feedlots grow more slowly and don't get as big, so it takes more of them to produce the same amount of meat.",
      "The researchers used a numerical model of the emissions produced across the process of raising beef, then simulated many herds of industrial and grass-fed cattle. It compared differences in how much food they would eat, how much methane and carbon dioxide they would emit and how much meat they would produce. Those differences mirror real-life scenarios; cattle in arid New Mexico and lush northern Michigan have different inputs and outputs.",
      "Eshel and his team also analyzed previous studies that examined how much cattle grazing promotes carbon storage, but found that even in the best-case scenarios, the amount of carbon that grasses could sequester didn\u2019t make up for the emissions of the cattle.",
      "Randy Jackson, a professor of grassland ecology at University of Wisconsin-Madison who was not involved in the study, said he has found similar results in his own research showing that grass-fed beef has higher emissions assuming the same demand. In fact, Eshel's team cited his work. But he worries that the study is too focused on minimizing emissions \u201cwithout concern for the environmental impacts beyond GHG load to the atmosphere,\u201d like biodiversity and soil and water quality, he wrote in an email.",
      "The American Grassfed Association, a nonprofit membership group for producers of grass-fed livestock, did not immediately provide a comment on the study.",
      "Jennifer Schmitt, who studies the sustainability of U.S. agricultural supply chains at the University of Minnesota and also wasn't involved in the study, said she thinks the paper \u201chelps us get a little closer to answering the question of maybe how much beef should we have on the landscape versus plant proteins,\u201d she said.",
      "Schmitt said maybe if beef was scaled back on a large enough scale and if farmers could free up more cropland for other foods that humans eat, the localized environmental benefits of grass-fed cattle could make up for the fact that they come with higher emissions.",
      "It would be harder to convince Eshel, however. He thinks climate change is \u201csecond to none\u201d when it comes to global problems and should be prioritized as such.",
      "\u201cI have a hard time imagining, even, a situation in which it will prove environmentally, genuinely wise, genuinely beneficial, to raise beef,\" Eshel said.",
      "For consumers who truly want to be environmentally conscious, he added, \"don't make beef a habit.\"",

      "They thought maybe they scurried there through Asia or Australia before volcanic activity pushed Fiji so far away.",

That journey is thought to be a record \u2014 further than any other land-dwelling vertebrate has ever traveled on the ocean.",
      "Scientists think that's how iguanas got to the Galapagos Islands off of Ecuador and between islands in the Caribbean. Initially they thought Fiji might be a bit too far for such a trip, but in a new study, researchers inspected the genes of 14 iguana species spanning the Americas, the Caribbean and Fiji. They discovered that Fijian iguanas were most closely related to desert iguanas from North America, and that the two groups split off around 31 million years ago.",
      "The researchers created a statistical model using that information and other tidbits about where iguanas live today and how they may spread. It suggested that the iguanas most likely floated to Fiji from North America.",

      "The research was published Monday in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.",
      "The journey from North America to Fiji could have taken a few months, but these desert iguanas would have been ideal passengers because they were adept at resisting dehydration and could have snacked on the plants underfoot.",

      "\u201cWe serve the public better by saying, OK, we\u2019ve issued this decision,\" she said. \"Now, let us help you understand what it is.\u201d",
      "Timmer told The Associated Press earlier this year that if the court had to do the abortion ruling over again, it would have approached the dissemination of information differently. In a Wednesday interview, she said that a news release and avatar video could have helped the public better understand the legal underpinnings of the lengthy decision \u2014 possibly including what it didn't do, which she said some misunderstood.",
      "\u201cWe got a lot of backlash for it and probably deservedly so, in terms of how can we complain that people don\u2019t understand what we did when we didn\u2019t really do enough to give a simplified version,\" she said in the January interview, explaining that people want to know the basis for the court\u2019s decisions and what they can do, such as lobbying state lawmakers for whatever changes in law would support their positions.",
      "Democratic Gov. Katie Hobbs signed a repeal of the ban last May, and in November, Arizona voters approved a constitutional amendment expanding abortion access up to the point of fetal viability.",
      "Created with a program called Creatify, Daniel and Victoria in a way bring to life the court's news releases. Videos featuring one or the other are being posted for every ruling by the high court, and may be used for Access to Justice projects, community programs and civics information in the future.",
      "The court has been sending out releases since October to summarize and explain rulings. After seeing success with the releases, it began exploring options to convey that information through video.",
      "The AI-generated avatars were the most efficient way to produce videos and get the information out, said court spokesperson Alberto Rodriguez. Producing a video usually can take hours, he said, but an AI-generated video is ready in about 30 minutes. The court might introduce more AI-generated reporters in the future, Rodriguez said in a news release.",
      "The justice who authors the legal opinion also drafts a news release, the wording of which must be approved by the entire bench. The justice then works with the court's communications team to craft a script for the avatars \u2014 the avatars aren't interpreting original court decisions or opinions, Rodriguez said.",
      "Daniel and Victoria's names and physical appearances were designed to represent a wide cross-section of people, Rodriguez said. He said they aren\u2019t meant to come off as real people and the court emphasizes their AI origins with disclaimers. The court is exploring different emotional deliveries, cadences and pronunciations as well as Spanish translations for the avatars, Rodriguez said.",
      "Mason Kortz, a clinical instructor at the Harvard Law School's Cyberlaw Clinic at the Berkman Klein Center for Internet & Society, described the court's new cyber employees as \"quite realistic.\" While their voices might give them away, he said some people could be fooled into thinking that Daniel and Victoria are real reporters if viewers are only reading the subtitles and looking at the characters' movements and facial expressions.",
      "Kortz also said it would be better for the language of the disclaimer that is in the videos' text description to be featured more prominently.",
      "\u201cYou want to make it as hard as possible for someone to advertently or inadvertently remove the disclaimer,\u201d he said.",
      "Asheley Landrum, associate professor at the Walter Cronkite School of Journalism and Mass Communication at Arizona State University, said the avatars feel robotic. She said a format that mimics real dialogue and storytelling might be more engaging than an AI reading of a news release.",
      "\u201cBecause it\u2019s not just about using AI or even creating videos,\u201d she said, \u201cbut about doing so in a way that really resonates with audiences.\u201d",
      "Still, it's fine line. She said engaging characteristics can help to build trust over time but the danger is that content could appear biased.",

      "The bus pulls away from the stop with its passengers on its own, brakes before changing lanes and eases down one of Barcelona\u2019s most fashionable boulevards.",
      "Renault is testing a new driverless mini-bus in Barcelona this week. The autonomous vehicle is running on a 2.2-km (1.3-mile) circular route with four stops in the center of the Spanish city. Adventurous commuters can jump on free of charge.",
      "The French carmaker has teamed up with WeRide, a company specializing in autonomous vehicles, to make the prototype. It unveiled the driverless bus at the French Open venue last year, but now it is testing it on the open road in Barcelona. It also has testing projects going in Valence, France, and at the Zurich airport.",
      "Pau Cugat was one of the curious to step aboard for a short ride along Passeig de Gracia boulevard.",
      "\u201cWe just passed by a regular, combustion-engine city bus, and I thought, \u2018Look, there is a bus of the past, and right behind it you have the bus of the future,\u2019\u201d the 18-year-old student said.",
      "Driverless taxis and buses are being tried out by companies in other cities, from San Francisco to Tokyo.",
      "But Renault\u2019s initiative comes as Europe generally lags behind the United States and China in driverless vehicle technology, where companies are fiercely competing to get ahead.",
      "\u201cThe US is doing a lot of experimentation with autonomous vehicles, the same thing in China,\u201d Patrick Vergelas, head of Renault's autonomous mobility projects, told The Associated Press. \u201cUntil now we don\u2019t have a lot in fact in Europe. And this is why we want to show that this works and prepare Europe to this route in public transportation.\u201d",
      "The electric bus can run for 120 kilometers without a recharge and reach 40 kilometers per hour (25 mph). It is equipped with 10 cameras and eight lidars (sensor arrays) to help it navigate the streets filled with cars, motorbikes and pedestrians. The company says the bus is able to drive safely on a given course through a busy downtown like that of bustling Barcelona.",
      "Carlos Santos, of Renault\u2019s autonomous driving group, said that he has seen all types of reactions from riders.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve seen a lot of behaviors of people. Some of them were smiling, (while) other people just start crying, taking photographs or even try to open the doors,\" Santos said before he insisted that the bus ride was a safe one.",
      "Barcelona's city officials said that they have had no reports of accidents caused by the experimental bus.",

      "LOS ANGELES -- The FBI and the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency are warning against a dangerous ransomware scheme.",
      "In an advisory posted earlier this week, government officials warned that a ransomware-as-a-service software called Medusa, which has launched ransomware attacks since 2021, has recently affected hundreds of people. Medusa uses phishing campaigns as its main method for stealing victims' credentials, according to CISA.",
      "To protect against the ransomware, officials recommended patching operating systems, software and firmware, in addition to using multifactor authentication for all services such as email and VPNs. Experts also recommended using long passwords, and warned against frequently recurring password changes because they can weaken security.",
      "Medusa developers and affiliates \u2014 called \u201cMedusa actors\u201d \u2014 use a double extortion model, where they \u201cencrypt victim data and threaten to publicly release exfiltrated data if a ransom is not paid,\u201d the advisory said. Medusa operates a data-leak site that shows victims alongside countdowns to the release of information.",
      "\u201cRansom demands are posted on the site, with direct hyperlinks to Medusa affiliated cryptocurrency wallets,\u201d the advisory said. \u201cAt this stage, Medusa concurrently advertises sale of the data to interested parties before the countdown timer ends. Victims can additionally pay $10,000 USD in cryptocurrency to add a day to the countdown timer.\u201d",
      "Since February, Medusa developers and affiliates have hit more than 300 victims across industries, including the medical, education, legal, insurance, technology and manufacturing sectors, CISA said.",

      "The next time you\u2019re due for a medical exam you may get a call from someone like Ana: a friendly voice that can help you prepare for your appointment and answer any pressing questions you might have.",
      "With her calm, warm demeanor, Ana has been trained to put patients at ease \u2014 like many nurses across the U.S. But unlike them, she is also available to chat 24-7, in multiple languages, from Hindi to Haitian Creole.",
      "That\u2019s because Ana isn\u2019t human, but an artificial intelligence program created by Hippocratic AI, one of a number of new companies offering ways to automate time-consuming tasks usually performed by nurses and medical assistants.",
      "It\u2019s the most visible sign of AI\u2019s inroads into health care, where hundreds of hospitals are using increasingly sophisticated computer programs to monitor patients' vital signs, flag emergency situations and trigger step-by-step action plans for care \u2014 jobs that were all previously handled by nurses and other health professionals.",
      "Hospitals say AI is helping their nurses work more efficiently while addressing burnout and understaffing. But nursing unions argue that this poorly understood technology is overriding nurses' expertise and degrading the quality of care patients receive.",
      "\u201cHospitals have been waiting for the moment when they have something that appears to have enough legitimacy to replace nurses,\u201d said Michelle Mahon of National Nurses United. \u201cThe entire ecosystem is designed to automate, de-skill and ultimately replace caregivers.\u201d",
      "Mahon\u2019s group, the largest nursing union in the U.S., has helped organize more than 20 demonstrations at hospitals across the country, pushing for the right to have say in how AI can be used \u2014 and protection from discipline if they decide to disregard automated advice. The group raised new alarms in January when Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the incoming health secretary, suggested AI nurses \u201cas good as any doctor\u201d could help deliver care in rural areas. On Friday, Dr. Mehmet Oz, who\u2019s been nominated to oversee Medicare and Medicaid, said he believes AI can \u201cliberate doctors and nurses from all the paperwork.\u201d",
      "Hippocratic AI initially promoted a rate of $9 an hour for its AI assistants, compared with about $40 an hour for a registered nurse. It has since dropped that language, instead touting its services and seeking to assure customers that they have been carefully tested. The company did not grant requests for an interview.",
      "Hospitals have been experimenting for years with technology designed to improve care and streamline costs, including sensors, microphones and motion-sensing cameras. Now that data is being linked with electronic medical records and analyzed in an effort to predict medical problems and direct nurses' care \u2014 sometimes before they've evaluated the patient themselves.",
      "Adam Hart was working in the emergency room at Dignity Health in Henderson, Nevada, when the hospital's computer system flagged a newly arrived patient for sepsis, a life-threatening reaction to infection. Under the hospital's protocol, he was supposed to immediately administer a large dose of IV fluids. But after further examination, Hart determined that he was treating a dialysis patient, or someone with kidney failure. Such patients have to be carefully managed to avoid overloading their kidneys with fluid.",
      "Hart raised his concern with the supervising nurse but was told to just follow the standard protocol. Only after a nearby physician intervened did the patient instead begin to receive a slow infusion of IV fluids.",
      "\u201cYou need to keep your thinking cap on\u2014 that\u2019s why you\u2019re being paid as a nurse,\u201d Hart said. \u201cTurning over our thought processes to these devices is reckless and dangerous.\u201d",
      "Hart and other nurses say they understand the goal of AI: to make it easier for nurses to monitor multiple patients and quickly respond to problems. But the reality is often a barrage of false alarms, sometimes erroneously flagging basic bodily functions \u2014 such as a patient having a bowel movement \u2014 as an emergency.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re trying to focus on your work but then you\u2019re getting all these distracting alerts that may or may not mean something,\u201d said Melissa Beebe, a cancer nurse at UC Davis Medical Center in Sacramento. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to even tell when it\u2019s accurate and when it\u2019s not because there are so many false alarms.\u201d",
      "Even the most sophisticated technology will miss will miss signs that nurses routinely pick up on, such as facial expressions and odors, notes Michelle Collins, dean of Loyola University\u2019s College of Nursing. But people aren't perfect either.",
      "\u201cIt would be foolish to turn our back on this completely,\u201d Collins said. \u201cWe should embrace what it can do to augment our care, but we should also be careful it doesn\u2019t replace the human element.\u201d",
      "More than 100,000 nurses left the workforce during the COVID-19 pandemic, according to one estimate, the biggest staffing drop in 40 years. As the U.S. population ages and nurses retire, the U.S. government estimates there will be more than 190,000 new openings for nurses every year through 2032.",
      "Faced with this trend, hospital administrators see AI filling a vital role: not taking over care, but helping nurses and doctors gather information and communicate with patients.",
      "At the University of Arkansas Medical Sciences in Little Rock, staffers need to make hundreds of calls every week to prepare patients for surgery. Nurses confirm information about prescriptions, heart conditions and other issues \u2014 like sleep apnea \u2014 that must be carefully reviewed before anesthesia.",
      "The problem: many patients only answer their phones in the evening, usually between dinner and their children\u2019s bedtime.",
      "\u201cSo what we need to do is find a way to call several hundred people in a 120-minute window -- but I really don\u2019t want to pay my staff overtime to do so,\u201d said Dr. Joseph Sanford, who oversees the center\u2019s health IT.",
      "Since January, the hospital has used an AI assistant from Qventus to contact patients and health providers, send and receive medical records and summarize their contents for human staffers. Qventus says 115 hospitals are using its technology, which aims to boost hospital earnings through quicker surgical turnarounds, fewer cancellations and reduced burnout.",
      "Each call begins with the program identifying itself as an AI assistant.",
      "\u201cWe always want to be fully transparent with our patients that sometimes they are talking to a human and sometimes they\u2019re not,\u201d Sanford said.",
      "While companies like Qventus are providing an administrative service, other AI developers see a bigger role for their technology.",
      "Israeli startup Xoltar specializes in humanlike avatars that conduct video calls with patients. The company is working with the Mayo Clinic on an AI assistant that teaches patients cognitive techniques for managing chronic pain. The company is also developing an avatar to help smokers quit. In early testing, patients have spent about 14 minutes talking to the program, which can pickup on facial expressions, body language and other cues, according to Xoltar.",
      "Nursing experts who study AI say such programs may work for people who are relatively healthy and proactive about their care. But that\u2019s not most people in the health system.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the very sick who are taking up the bulk of health care in the U.S. and whether or not chatbots are positioned for those folks is something we really have to consider,\u201d said Roschelle Fritz of the University of California Davis School of Nursing.",

      "Closer to home in our own Milky Way galaxy, Spherex will hunt for water and other ingredients of life in the icy clouds between stars where new solar systems emerge.",
      "The cone-shaped Spherex \u2014 at 1,110 pounds (500 kilograms) or the heft of a grand piano \u2014 will take six months to map the entire sky with its infrared eyes and wide field of view. Four full-sky surveys are planned over two years, as the telescope circles the globe from pole to pole 400 miles (650 kilometers) up.",
      "Spherex won\u2019t see galaxies in exquisite detail like NASA\u2019s larger and more elaborate Hubble and Webb space telescopes, with their narrow fields of view.",
      "Instead of counting galaxies or focusing on them, Spherex will observe the total glow produced by the whole lot, including the earliest ones formed in the wake of the universe-creating Big Bang.",
      "\u201cThis cosmological glow captures all light emitted over cosmic history,\u201d said the mission\u2019s chief scientist Jamie Bock of the California Institute of Technology. \u201cIt\u2019s a very different way of looking at the universe,\u201d enabling scientists to see what sources of light may have been missed in the past.",
      "By observing the collective glow, scientists hope to tease out the light from the earliest galaxies and learn how they came to be, Bock said.",
      "\u201cWe won\u2019t see the Big Bang. But we\u2019ll see the aftermath from it and learn about the beginning of the universe that way,\u201d he said.",
      "The telescope\u2019s infrared detectors will be able to distinguish 102 colors invisible to the human eye, yielding the most colorful, inclusive map ever made of the cosmos.",
      "It's like \"looking at the universe through a set of rainbow-colored glasses,\u201d said deputy project manager Beth Fabinsky of NASA\u2019s Jet Propulsion Laboratory.",
      "To keep the infrared detectors super cold \u2014 minus 350 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 210 degrees Celsius) \u2014 Spherex has a unique look. It sports three aluminum-honeycomb cones, one inside the other, to protect from the sun and Earth's heat, resembling a 10-foot (3-meter) shield collar for an ailing dog.",
      "Besides the telescope, SpaceX\u2019s Falcon rocket provided a lift from Vandenberg Space Force Base for a quartet of NASA satellites called Punch. From their own separate polar orbit, the satellites will observe the sun\u2019s corona, or outer atmosphere, and the resulting solar wind.",

      "\u201cThat\u2019s not good at all,\u201d Foster said after learning the district inadvertently released the records. \u201cBut what are my options? What do I do? Pull my kid out of school?\u201d",
      "Foster says she\u2019d be upset if her daughter\u2019s private information was compromised.",
      "\u201cAt the same time,\u201d she said, \u201cI would like to avoid a school shooting or suicide.\u201d",
      "Gaggle uses a machine-learning algorithm to scan what students search or write online via a school-issued laptop or tablet 24 hours a day, or whenever they log into their school account on a personal device. The latest contract Vancouver signed, in summer 2024, shows a price of $328,036 for three school years \u2014 approximately the cost of employing one extra counselor.",
      "The algorithm detects potential indicators of problems like bullying, self-harm, suicide or school violence and then sends a screenshot to human reviewers. If Gaggle employees confirm the issue might be serious, the company alerts the school. In cases of imminent danger, Gaggle calls school officials directly. In rare instances where no one answers, Gaggle may contact law enforcement for a welfare check.",
      "A Vancouver school counselor who requested anonymity out of fear of retaliation said they receive three or four student Gaggle alerts per month. In about half the cases, the district contacts parents immediately.",
      "\u201cA lot of times, families don\u2019t know. We open that door for that help,\u201d the counselor said. Gaggle is \u201cgood for catching suicide and self-harm, but students find a workaround once they know they are getting flagged.\u201d",
      "Seattle Times and AP reporters saw what kind of writing set off Gaggle\u2019s alerts after requesting information about the type of content flagged. Gaggle saved screenshots of activity that set off each alert, and school officials accidentally provided links to them, not realizing they weren\u2019t protected by a password.",
      "After learning about the records inadvertently released to reporters, Gaggle updated its system. Now, after 72 hours, only those logged into a Gaggle account can view the screenshots. Gaggle said this feature was already in the works but had not yet been rolled out to every customer.",
      "The company says the links must be accessible without a login during those 72 hours so emergency contacts \u2014 who often receive these alerts late at night on their phones \u2014 can respond quickly.",
      "In Vancouver, the monitoring technology flagged more than 1,000 documents for suicide and nearly 800 for threats of violence. While many alerts were serious, many others turned out to be false alarms, like a student essay about the importance of consent or a goofy chat between friends.",
      "Foster\u2019s daughter Bryn, a Vancouver School of Arts and Academics sophomore, was one such false alarm. She was called into the principal\u2019s office after writing a short story featuring a scene with mildly violent imagery.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m glad they\u2019re being safe about it, but I also think it can be a bit much,\u201d Bryn said.",
      "School officials maintain alerts are warranted even in less severe cases or false alarms, ensuring potential issues are addressed promptly.",
      "\u201cIt allows me the opportunity to meet with a student I maybe haven\u2019t met before and build that relationship,\u201d said Chele Pierce, a Skyview High School counselor.",
      "Between October 2023 and October 2024, nearly 2,200 students, about 10% of the district\u2019s enrollment, were the subject of a Gaggle alert. At the Vancouver School of Arts and Academics, where Bryn is a student, about 1 in 4 students had communications that triggered a Gaggle alert.",
      "While schools continue to use surveillance technology, its long-term effects on student safety are unclear. There\u2019s no independent research showing it measurably lowers student suicide rates or reduces violence.",
      "A 2023 RAND study found only \u201cscant evidence\u201d of either benefits or risks from AI surveillance, concluding: \u201cNo research to date has comprehensively examined how these programs affect youth suicide prevention.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf you don\u2019t have the right number of mental health counselors, issuing more alerts is not actually going to improve suicide prevention,\u201d said report co-author Benjamin Boudreaux, an AI ethics researcher.",
      "In the screenshots released by Vancouver schools, at least six students were potentially outed to school officials after writing about being gay, transgender or struggling with gender dysphoria.",
      "LGBTQ+ students are more likely than their peers to suffer from depression and suicidal thoughts, and turn to the internet for support.",
      "\u201cWe know that gay youth, especially those in more isolated environments, absolutely use the internet as a life preserver,\u201d said Katy Pearce, a University of Washington professor who researches technology in authoritarian states.",
      "In one screenshot, a Vancouver high schooler wrote in a Google survey form they\u2019d been subject to trans slurs and racist bullying. Who created this survey is unclear, but the person behind it had falsely promised confidentiality: \u201cI am not a mandated reporter, please tell me the whole truth.\u201d",
      "When North Carolina\u2019s Durham Public Schools piloted Gaggle in 2021, surveys showed most staff members found it helpful.",
      "But community members raised concerns. An LGBTQ+ advocate reported to the Board of Education that a Gaggle alert about self-harm had led to a student being outed to their family, who were not supportive.",
      "Glenn Thompson, a Durham School of the Arts graduate, spoke up at a board meeting during his senior year. One of his teachers promised a student confidentiality for an assignment related to mental health. A classmate was then \u201cblindsided\u201d when Gaggle alerted school officials about something private they\u2019d disclosed. Thompson said no one in the class, including the teacher, knew the school was piloting Gaggle.",
      "\u201cYou can\u2019t just (surveil) people and not tell them. That\u2019s a horrible breach of security and trust,\u201d said Thompson, now a college student, in an interview.",
      "After hearing about these experiences, the Durham Board of Education voted to stop using Gaggle in 2023. The district ultimately decided it was not worth the risk of outing students or eroding relationships with adults.",
      "The debate over privacy and security is complicated, and parents are often unaware it\u2019s even an issue. Pearce, the University of Washington professor, doesn\u2019t remember reading about Securly, the surveillance software Seattle Public Schools uses, when she signed the district\u2019s responsible use form before her son received a school laptop.",
      "Even when families learn about school surveillance, they may be unable to opt out. Owasso Public Schools in Oklahoma has used Gaggle since 2016 to monitor students outside of class.",
      "For years, Tim Reiland, the parent of two teenagers, had no idea the district was using Gaggle. He found out only after asking if his daughter could bring her personal laptop to school instead of being forced to use a district one because of privacy concerns.",
      "The district refused Reiland\u2019s request.",
      "When Reiland's daughter, Zoe, found out about Gaggle, she says she felt so \u201cfreaked out\u201d that she stopped Googling anything personal on her Chromebook, even questions about her menstrual period. She didn\u2019t want to get called into the office for \u201csearching up lady parts.\u201d",
      "\u201cI was too scared to be curious,\u201d she said.",
      "School officials say they don\u2019t track metrics measuring the technology\u2019s efficacy but believe it has saved lives.",
      "Yet technology alone doesn\u2019t create a safe space for all students. In 2024, a nonbinary teenager at Owasso High School named Nex Benedict died by suicide after relentless bullying from classmates. A subsequent U.S. Department of Education Office for Civil Rights investigation found the district responded with \u201cdeliberate indifference\u201d to some families\u2019 reports of sexual harassment, mainly in the form of homophobic bullying.",
      "During the 2023-24 school year, the Owasso schools received close to 1,000 Gaggle alerts, including 168 alerts for harassment and 281 for suicide.",
      "When asked why bullying remained a problem despite surveillance, Russell Thornton, the district\u2019s executive director of technology responded: \u201cThis is one tool used by administrators. Obviously, one tool is not going to solve the world\u2019s problems and bullying.\u201d",
      "Despite the risks, surveillance technology can help teachers intervene before a tragedy.",
      "A middle school student in the Seattle-area Highline School District who was potentially being trafficked used Gaggle to communicate with campus staff, said former Superintendent Susan Enfield.",
      "\u201cThey knew that the staff member was reading what they were writing,\u201d Enfield said. \u201cIt was, in essence, that student\u2019s way of asking for help.\u201d",
      "Still, developmental psychology research shows it is vital for teens to have private spaces online to explore their thoughts and seek support.",
      "\u201cThe idea that kids are constantly under surveillance by adults \u2014 I think that would make it hard to develop a private life, a space to make mistakes, a space to go through hard feelings without adults jumping in,\u201d said Boudreaux, the AI ethics researcher.",
      "Gaggle\u2019s Patterson says school-issued devices are not the appropriate place for unlimited self-exploration. If that exploration takes a dark turn, such as making a threat, \u201cthe school\u2019s going to be held liable,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you\u2019re looking for that open free expression, it really can\u2019t happen on the school system\u2019s computers.\u201d",

      "WASHINGTON -- A fossil of a partial face from a human ancestor is the oldest in western Europe, archaeologists reported Wednesday.",
      "The incomplete skull \u2014 a section of the left cheek bone and upper jaw \u2013 was found in northern Spain in 2022. The fossil is between 1.1 million and 1.4 million years old, according to research published in the journal Nature.",
      "\u201cThe fossil is exciting,\" said Eric Delson, a paleontologist at the American Museum of Natural History, who was not involved in the study. \u201cIt's the first time we have significant remains older than 1 million years old in western Europe.\u201d",
      "A collection of older fossils from early human ancestors was previously found in Georgia, near the crossroads of eastern Europe and Asia. Those are estimated to be 1.8 million years old.",
      "The Spanish fossil is the first evidence that clearly shows human ancestors \u201cwere taking excursions into Europe\u201d at that time, said Rick Potts, director of the Smithsonian\u2019s Human Origins Program.",
      "But there is not yet evidence that the earliest arrivals persisted there long, he said. \u201cThey may get to a new location and then die out,\u201d said Potts, who had no role in the study.",
      "The partial skull bears many similarities to Homo erectus, but there are also some anatomical differences, said study co-author Rosa Huguet, an archaeologist at the Catalan Institute of Human Paleoecology and Social Evolution in Tarragona, Spain.",
      "Homo erectus arose around 2 million years ago and moved from Africa to regions of Asia and Europe, with the last individuals dying out around 100,000 years ago, said Potts.",
      "It can be challenging to identify which group of early humans a fossil find belongs to if there's only a single fragment versus many bones that show a range of features, said University of Zurich paleoanthropologist Christoph Zollikofer, who was not involved in the study.",
      "The same cave complex in Spain's Atapuerca Mountains where the new fossil was found also previously yielded other significant clues to the ancient human past. Researchers working in the region have also found more recent fossils from Neanderthals and early Homo sapiens.",

      "Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin on Wednesday announced nearly three dozen deregulatory moves that he said would spur the U.S. economy by rolling back rules that have unfairly burdened industry",
      "Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin on Wednesday announced nearly three dozen deregulatory moves that he said would spur the U.S. economy by rolling back rules that have unfairly burdened industry. Many of the moves would affect landmark regulations aimed at protecting clean air and water.",
      "Industry generally applauded the proposed changes, while environmentalists worried about what would amount to historic rollbacks if they are approved. Here's a look at some of the 31 regulatory changes Zeldin announced:",
      "The Biden administration set limits on planet-warming emissions from existing gas and coal-fired power plants \u2013 a major step in the administration\u2019s effort to reduce greenhouse gases from the heavily polluting energy sector. Trump has long opposed such tough, climate-friendly limits and has instead promoted oil and gas development. Zeldin said the agency would reconsider the Biden administration standards to avoid constraining energy production.",
      "Coal plants emit toxic metals like mercury and the Biden administration issued a rule to severely limit those pollutants. Officials at the time said technology had progressed enough for these plants to do better. The EPA on Wednesday said nearly two dozen states had sued, arguing the rule was costly and a major burden, especially to coal plants. They also considering offering industry a two-year compliance extension while officials reconsider the rule.",
      "Hazardous metals like mercury and arsenic end up in the wastewater of steam-powered electric generating power plants like coal. These can have serious health effects including increasing cancer rates and lowering childhood IQ scores. The Biden administration tightened regulations of this wastewater. The EPA said it will revisit those \u201cstringent\u201d rules that are costly to industry and therefore may raise residential energy bills.",
      "Currently, treated wastewater generated from oil and gas drilling can be used in limited ways in certain western lands, such as for agriculture. Environmentalists say there can be a broad range of contaminants in the wastewater, some of which might not be known. The EPA said it will reconsider those rules and look at how the treated water could be used for other purposes like cooling data centers, fighting fires and other ecological needs. They say the current rules are costly, old and don\u2019t reflect the capabilities of modern treatment technologies.",
      "The Biden administration tightened safeguards against accidents for industrial and chemical plants that millions of people live near. The agency\u2019s risk management program added planning and reporting requirements for facilities and forced some to implement new safeguards. Accidents at these plants can be severe \u2013 a 2019 explosion at a Texas facility, for example, forced tens of thousands to evacuate, for example. Industry associations have criticized parts of the rule, such as requirements to publicly report sensitive information.",
      "Zeldin said Biden administration officials \u201cignored recommendations from national security experts on how their rule makes chemical and other sensitive facilities in America more vulnerable to attack.\u201d The EPA is reconsidering the rule.",
      "The EPA said it was reconsidering its mandatory greenhouse gas reporting program, which requires thousands of major industrial polluters to tell the agency about its emissions. Zeldin said the \u201cbureaucratic government program\u201d costs hundreds of millions of dollars and doesn\u2019t help air quality. Until now, the EPA said the data helped businesses compare their emissions to competitors and find opportunities to reduce them and lower costs.",
      "Zeldin vowed to review his agency\u2019s emissions standards for cars and trucks, calling the tightened emissions rules the \u201cfoundation for the Biden-Harris electric vehicle mandate.\u201d Nothing the Biden administration implemented required automakers to make and sell EVs or for consumers to buy them. Loosening standards would allow vehicles to emit more planet-warming greenhouse gases, but many automakers have already been investing in making their vehicles more efficient.",
      "The scientific finding, under the 2009 Clean Air Act, determined that planet-warming greenhouse gases endanger public health and welfare. It has been at the core of the nation\u2019s action against climate change. Trump had already directed the EPA to consider the finding\u2019s \u201clegality\u201d in an executive order. Experts say the impacts of climate change on human health and the environment are already clear, and that upending the finding would be devastating.",
      "This program enforced strict rules to reduce the use of hydrofluorocarbons, highly potent and planet-warming greenhouse gases used in refrigerators, air conditioners, heat pumps and more. HFCs, as they are known, are thousands of times more powerful than carbon dioxide and leak through equipment that uses compressed refrigerants. Dozens of countries around the globe have pledged to slash their use and production of the chemicals.",
      "This rule was intended to limit air pollution by restricting power plant smokestack emissions, and those from other industrial sites, across 11 states. Eliminating it would especially impact downwind neighborhoods that are burdened by pollution from ground-level ozone, or smog, that is out of their control. However, the Supreme Court had already put a hold on the rule last summer, ruling that states challenging it were likely to prevail.",
      "These seats have long been politicized given how influential they can be in setting national environmental policy. The board reviews \u201cthe quality and relevance of the scientific and technical information being used by the EPA or proposed as the basis for Agency regulations\u201d and agency research programs. Congress directed the agency to establish the board to provide the Administrator science advice in 1978. The committee can give \u201cindependent advice\u201d to the agency\u2019s Administrator specific to the nation\u2019s Ambient Air Quality Standards.",
      "Power plants and industrial facilities release particulate matter, or soot, that can easily pass through a person\u2019s lungs and into their bloodstream. Last year, the Biden administration tightened standards regulating soot in response to scientific research indicating existing regulations were insufficient. At the time, the EPA estimated its stronger regulations would save thousands of lives and prevent hundreds of thousands of cases of asthma and lost workdays annually. The Trump administration\u2019s EPA says these regulations are \u201ca major obstacle\u201d for companies and that the U.S. has low levels of soot.",
      "These EPA standards apply to pollutants known or suspected to cause cancer, birth defects or other serious health problems. Industrial facilities are required to follow strict standards to monitor and limit the amount of these chemicals they release into the air. Last year, the EPA tightened standards surrounding ethylene oxide emissions, a human carcinogen commonly used as a sterilizer for medical equipment. The Trump administration said it is considering a \u201c2-year compliance exemption\u201d for facilities affected by these standards, among others.",
      "For decades, this EPA program has required states to reduce pollution that threatens scenic views in more than 150 national parks and wilderness areas, including in the Grand Canyon and Yellowstone. Zeldin said that the U.S. has made strides in improving visibility in national parks and that the program is being used as justification for shutting down industrial facilities and threatening affordable energy.",
      "The social cost of carbon is an EPA tool to weigh the economic costs and benefits of regulating polluting industries by putting a price tag on climate-warming carbon dioxide emissions \u2013 set at $190 per ton under the Biden administration\u2019s EPA. That calculation is used in cost-benefit analyses, and was intended to account for greenhouse gas emissions\u2019 impacts including natural disasters, crop damage, health problems and sea-level rise. Under the first Trump administration, carbon was pegged at around $5 per ton. An executive order Trump signed on his first day in office directs the EPA to consider eliminating this calculation entirely to advance his \u201cUnleashing American Energy\u201d policy.",
      "After coal is burned, ash filled with heavy pollutants including arsenic, lead and mercury is left behind and typically stored in giant pits under federal regulation. The EPA says it is now seeking to rapidly put regulation \u201cmore fully into state hands,\u201d which environmental groups fear could lead to weaker standards. Last year, the Biden administration closed a gap that had allowed companies to avoid responsibility for cleaning up inactive coal ash pits \u2013 a policy that environmental groups say could now be repealed.",

Mayor Gaetano Manfredi told reporters that one church, a seven-story residential building and another building were declared off-limits due to damage, and some schools were closed as a precaution.",
      "Inspectors were checking buildings for further damage, Manfredi said. \u201cWe are following with the greatest attention all of our structures, and are monitoring all events in real time,\u2019\u2019 the mayor said.",
      "In all, 11 people sought hospital treatment. One woman was injured after part of a ceiling fell, and several others suffered cuts from glass that broke in the quake, Manfredi said.",
      "Seismologists have reported a fresh increase in activity around the Phlegrean Fields over recent weeks. Authorities last summer conducted drills in preparation for a major emergency as the frequency of temblors increased.",
      "The area around the Phlegrean Fields, which encompasses western neighborhoods of Naples and its suburbs, is both seismically and volcanically active. The surface has been pushed up 1.3 meters (4.3 feet) since 2006, which is higher than prior to the last major event in 1984, but seismologists have emphasized it is impossible to predict when an eruption or stronger quake might occur.",
      "At least 500,000 people live in the zone most at risk should the volcano erupt. Italy's national institute for geophysics and vulcanology has called for a governmental plan to ensure that structures can withstand a quake of at least a magnitude 5.0.",
      "During the 1984 event, 40,000 residents were evacuated during a period of intense seismic activity as a precaution against a feared eruption that did not occur.",

      "An hours-long outage on StudentAid",
      "WASHINGTON -- An hours-long outage Wednesday on StudentAid.gov, the federal website for student loans and financial aid, underscored the risks in rapidly gutting the Department of Education, as President Donald Trump aims to dismantle the agency.",
      "Hundreds of users reported FAFSA outages to Downdetector starting midday Wednesday, saying they were having trouble completing the form, which is required for financial aid at colleges nationwide. The National Association of Student Financial Aid Administrators, a group of people who handle colleges' financial aid awards, also received reports of users experiencing technical issues and having trouble completing the FAFSA.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve been trying to get more clarity on why it\u2019s down,\" said Allie Bidwell Arcese, a spokeswoman for NASFAA. The Education Department hadn't shared any information on the outage, she said. \u201cThe maintenance and troubleshooting may be impacted by yesterday\u2019s layoffs.\u201d",
      "The developers and IT support staff who worked on the FAFSA form were hard hit in the Education Department's layoffs Tuesday, along with staff buyouts and the termination of probationary employees. In all, the Education Department has reduced its staff by half, to roughly 2,000, since Trump took office.",
      "A list of laid-off staff obtained and verified by AP shows more than 300 people cut from Federal Student Aid \u2014 two dozen of them from Federal Student Aid's technology division. That included the entire team responsible for systems supporting the FAFSA form, a person with knowledge of the outage told The Associated Press, speaking anonymously for fear of retaliation. While laid-off staffers are still technically employed until March 21, they had limited access to their email, phones and computers, making a response to the outage difficult, the person said. At one point Wednesday, about 70 people had joined a Teams call to try to pinpoint the cause of the outage.",
      "The call continued for hours. By Wednesday evening, the website carried a banner claiming \u201cPlanned Maintenance\u201d was underway, and login access was cut off.",
      "The Education Department did not respond to a request for comment on the outage.",
      "Problems with the FAFSA had vexed the administration of former President Joe Biden, drawing rebuke from Republicans. The form was overhauled last year in an attempt to simplify it, but technical problems blocked students from submitting forms or bungled financial aid calculations.",
      "Advocates say the frustration probably led thousands of students to give up on going to college at all. Last fall, U.S. colleges saw a 5% decrease in freshmen enrollment over the previous year, and it was deeper at colleges with large numbers of low-income students, according to the National Student Clearinghouse.",

      "Universities across the U.S. have announced hiring freezes, citing new financial uncertainty as the Trump administration threatens a range of cuts to federal contracts and research grants.",
      "In February, the administration announced deep cuts to National Institutes of Health grants for research institutions, a shift that could reduce the money going to some universities by over $100 million. Some schools already have shelved projects because of the cuts, which have been delayed temporarily by a court challenge.",
      "Recently, President Donald Trump has shown appetite for targeting colleges\u2019 funding more directly. His administration has vowed to take federal money from colleges that defy his agenda on issues including diversity, equity and inclusion programs, transgender athletes\u2019 participation in women\u2019s sports, and student protests that he deems \u201cillegal.\u201d",
      "On March 7, the administration on Friday pulled $400 million from Columbia University over what it described as the Ivy League school\u2019s failure to squelch antisemitism on campus. The Education Department followed up with a letter Monday warning 60 colleges they could lose federal money if they fail to make campuses safe for Jewish students.",
      "Higher education has been a steady job generator since the pandemic, with private colleges and universities adding 35,000 jobs nationwide last year. Hiring freezes and cuts at universities could contribute to slower job growth in the months ahead, advocates for workers say.",
      "Over the last two weeks, more than a dozen institutions have announced limits on hiring for faculty and staff positions and other measures to tighten purse strings.",
      "Hiring freezes have been announced at schools including Harvard; the Massachusetts Institute of Technology; Notre Dame; the University of Pennsylvania; the University of Pittsburgh; Emory University; the University of Vermont; North Carolina State University; the University of Washington; and the University of California, San Diego.",

      "The University of Washington\u2019s provost, Tricia Serio, said in a blog post she recognized how the uncertainty of the moment could \u201cprompt stress, worry and anxiety.\u201d",
      "\u201cBy using this time to proactively save our resources and thoughtfully plan, we will be better prepared to manage any future funding cuts to protect our mission for the public good,\u201d she wrote.",
      "Several universities said they also are looking for other ways to reduce expenses, including Emory, where President Gregory Fenves said it is necessary to \u201ctake prudent measures to prepare for what may be a significant disruption to our finances.\u201d",
      "Colleges had been bracing for head winds under the new administration, including the possibility of a big hike in the tax on university endowments. But the new administration has taken several steps that have heightened uncertainty.",
      "In addition to the reductions ordered to NIH grants, money for research and projects has been held up by delays in approval processes and cuts to programs linked to DEI.",
      "After a dustup between Trump and Maine\u2019s governor over transgender athletes, the U.S. Department of Agriculture suspended funding for research at the University of Maine. The funding was restored this week, officials said.",
      "The $400 million hit to Columbia in particular shook institutions of higher education.",
      "The withdrawal of federal money is not the way to fight hate, said Ted Mitchell, president of the American Council of Education. The cancelation, he said, will \u201ceviscerate academic and research activities\u201d at Columbia.",
      "\u201cBut we also are deeply concerned that unless the administration reverses course, it will move on to wrongly target research at other institutions, wreaking further chaos, confusion, and negative consequences,\u201d Mitchell said.",

      "That positive assessment follows his prediction Sunday night that \"we'll see if we have something to announce -- maybe by Tuesday,\" saying \"a lot of work\" had been done over the weekend. \"Maybe we can. Maybe we can't, but I think we have a very good chance.\"",
      "Since then, Putin has been noncommittal on the proposal while fighting intensifies in Kursk.",

      "A key question moving forward is how far Trump will go in pressuring Russia to agree to a ceasefire and ultimately bring an end to the three-year conflict, which began when Putin's forces invaded its sovereign neighbor.",
      "The Trump administration took drastic steps in stopping military aid and pausing some intelligence sharing with Ukraine after the Oval Office clash between Trump and Zelenskyy. Those two tools resumed after Ukraine agreed to the ceasefire last Tuesday.",
      "Plus, U.S. officials have said it would be unrealistic for Ukraine to return to its prewar borders and expressly ruled out its bid for NATO membership.",

      "\"Whether or not the planes had cleared U.S. territory, the U.S. retained custody at least until the planes landed and the individuals were turned over to foreign governments,\" the plaintiffs' filing said. \"And the Court could not have been clearer that it was concerned with losing jurisdiction and authority to order the individuals returned if they were handed over to foreign governments, not with whether the planes had cleared U.S. territory or had even landed in another country.\"",
      "Plaintiffs' attorneys said that based on publicly available information, it appears that two flights carrying migrants under the Alien Enemies Act landed after the court's verbal and written orders. They added that \"public comments made by Defendants and the President of El Salvador\" boasting about the court being \"too late\" to stop the deportations reinforces concerns that the Trump administration may have violated the order.",
      "\"Defendants could have turned the plane around without handing over individuals subject to the Proclamation and this Court's [Temporary Restraining Order],\" the lawyers argued.",
      "Finding the deportations would cause irreparable harm, Boasberg's temporary restraining order on Saturday barred the Trump administration from deporting \"all non-citizens who are subject to the AEA proclamation\" for at least 14 days.",
      "\"You shall inform your clients of this immediately any plane containing these folks that is going to take off or is in the air needs to be returned to the United States,\" Boasberg said during Saturday's hearing. \"However that's accomplished, turning around the plane, or not embarking anyone on the plane. ... This is something that you need to make sure is complied with immediately.\"",

      "President Donald Trump's order to cut off funding to Voice of America (VOA) and several other affiliated pro-democracy media outlets has drawn widespread criticism from press freedom organizations and journalists, who warn it risks severely damaging independent journalism covering some of the world's most repressive countries.",
      "Trump announced an executive order late Friday to effectively dismantle the U.S. Agency for Global Media, which supervises VOA. Following the order, the head of VOA said all of its 1,300 journalists and staff had been put on administrative leave.",
      "Trump\u2019s executive order also terminated grants for Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty and Radio Free Asia, which broadcast news to Eastern Europe, Russia, China and North Korea and Central Asia.",
      "The order threatens to close down media organizations that for decades have provided independent news coverage and promoted journalism to hundreds of millions of people worldwide and provided an information lifeline to people living in countries under authoritarian regimes, advocates say.",
      "The Committee to Protect Journalists, a prominent press freedom organization, called the move a \u201creward to dictators and despots\u201d and urged Congress to act to preserve the media outlets.",
      "VOA and the other media organizations were founded during World War II to promote democracy and provide uncensored information. But even after the end of the Cold War, in many authoritarian and poor countries, they have continued to play a powerful role as independent news providers, sometimes as the only open media where all others are censored or severely under-resourced, such as Iran, Russia, Belarus, Afghanistan and North Korea.",
      "VOA and its affiliates reach 420 million people in 63 languages and more than 100 countries each week, according to the U.S. Agency for Global Media. VOA and RFE/RL\u2019s reporting has been routinely deemed a threat by authoritarian regimes, which have sought to pressure them, including by jailing their journalists.",

      "\u201cShutting down outlets like VOA Persian, Radio Liberty, and Radio Farda would deal a major blow to press freedom and the free flow of information in Iran, directly serving the interests of the Islamic Republic,\u201d the journalist, who asked not to be named for security reasons, added.",

      "The White House in a statement Saturday said the order \u201cwill ensure that taxpayers are no longer on the hook for radical propaganda.\u201d",
      "The Trump administration has also framed the gutting of VOA as part of the drastic effort to cut down the federal budget being led by Elon Musk.

      "Trump\u2019s threat comes after the United States launched a new series of airstrikes against the Yemeni group beginning Saturday. The Houthis on Sunday claimed to have thwarted \u201ca hostile attack the enemy was preparing to launch against our country.\u201d A U.S. official told ABC News that the Houthis fired 11 drones and one ballistic missile at the USS Harry S Truman aircraft carrier group in the Red Sea on Saturday, none of which came close to hitting any U.S. vessels.",
      "In a post on his Truth Social platform, Trump called the Houthis \"sinister mobsters and thugs\" said their attacks \"emanate from, and are created by, IRAN.\"",
      "Trump said Iran is \"dictating every move, giving them the weapons, supplying them with money and highly sophisticated Military equipment, and even, so-called, 'Intelligence.'\"",
      "\"Every shot fired by the Houthis will be looked upon, from this point forward, as being a shot fired from the weapons and leadership of IRAN, and IRAN will be held responsible, and suffer the consequences, and those consequences will be dire!\" Trump said.",
      "On Sunday, the Houthis claimed to have fired 18 ballistic missiles and a drone in two separate attacks over the previous 24 hours. All drones were downed by fighters -- 10 shot down by Air Force planes and one by Navy planes -- while the ballistic missile was not intercepted as it fell far short of the vessels, the U.S. official said.",
      "Trump described the U.S. strikes as \"decisive and powerful military action\" against the Iranian-backed group. The Houthis have been targeting Western-linked shipping and launching munitions into Israel since the fall of 2022, in protest of Israel's war against Hamas in the Gaza Strip.",
      "\"They have waged an unrelenting campaign of piracy, violence, and terrorism against American, and other, ships, aircraft and drones,\" Trump posted on Truth Social on Saturday. \"We will use overwhelming lethal force until we have achieved our objective.\"",
      "Lt. Gen. Alexus Grynkewich, the head of operations at the Joint Staff, told reporters at Monday's Pentagon press briefing that the U.S. struck 30 targets at multiple locations on Saturday and there were additional strikes conducted on Sunday. He said the operation continued Monday \"and it will continue in the coming days until we achieve the President's objectives.\u201d",
      "Grynkewich said targets included terrorist training sites, unmanned aerial vehicle infrastructure, weapons manufacturing capabilities and weapon storage facilities. They also included command and control centers, where \"several senior duty unmanned aerial vehicle experts were located on Sunday,\" as well as facilities that have been used to threaten shipping.",
      "The Yemeni Health Ministry said the strikes killed 53 people and injured 98 more. Grynkewich there were \u201cdozens of military fatalities\u201d from Saturday\u2019s strikes and that there are no indications of civilian casualties. He said the Pentagon was aware of reports of civilian casualties, and \u201cwe look at those closely when they do come in, but we have no credible indications.\u201d",
      "Speaking with reporters on Air Force One on Sunday, Trump said he was not concerned about retaliatory strikes related to the latest American strikes.",
      "National security adviser Mike Waltz told ABC's \"This Week\" on Sunday that the strikes represented \"an overwhelming response that actually targeted multiple Houthi leaders and took them out. And the difference here is, one, going after the Houthi leadership, and two, holding Iran responsible.\"",
      "Detailing their latest attack on U.S. Navy vessels, the Houthis said in a Sunday statement that they will \"continue to ban the passage of Israeli ships through the zone of \u200b\u200boperations until the blockade on the Gaza Strip is lifted.\"",
      "The Houthis then released a statement late Monday, claiming \"the implementation of a qualitative military operation targeting the US aircraft carrier USS Harry Truman for the third time in the past 48 hours, as well as targeting a US destroyer, in response to the brutal US aggression against our country.\" The extent of their attacks or their relative success has not been confirmed.",

      "Dust storms have proven deadly to motorists across the U.S. for years",
      "TOPEKA, Kan. -- A gust of wind sweeps over bare soil, kicking up enough dirt and dust to cut visibility to nearly zero, and for drivers, the dust storm seems to come out of nowhere.",
      "Such conditions resulted in a pileup on Interstate 70 last week in western Kansas involving dozens of cars and trucks that left eight people dead. Blinding dust also prompted New Mexico's transportation department to close Interstate 25 from the Colorado border southwest to Las Vegas, New Mexico.",
      "Hazy or dust-darkened skies have recalled the \u201cDust Bowl\u201d of the 1930s, when millions of tons of blowing soil buried farms and coated towns across the Great Plains. Lesser storms occur every year, particularly in the western U.S., particularly when farmland hasn't been planted yet in the spring. Some scientists worry that many motorists don't take them seriously enough.",
      "\u201cWe have a very low level of public awareness of a dust storm and what damage it can cause,\u201d said Daniel Tong, an associate professor of atmospheric chemistry at George Mason University who is among the authors of a 2023 paper on dust storm deaths.",
      "The High Plains Museum in Goodland displays a photo of a tractor buried in blown soil in the 1930s, a reminder of the consequences of a severe drought across the Great Plains that came after farming had destroyed native grasses.",
      "The fatalities Friday near Goodland were the first in the area in a dust storm since 2014, said Jeremy Martin, the Weather Service meteorologist in charge there.",
      "But they came less than a month after an 11-car pileup on I-25 left three people dead, with heavy dust cited as a factor, according to Albuquerque TV's KRQE. Similarly, a dust storm on I-55 between St. Louis and Springfield, Illinois, in 2023 led to a fatal pileup involving dozens of vehicles.",
      "In 1991, 17 people died in an accident involving more than 100 vehicles on I-5 in California's San Joaquin Valley, blamed on blowing dust.",
      "Tong and four co-authors concluded in their paper published in 2023 in the Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society that there were 232 deaths from \u201cwindblown dust events\u201d from 2007 through 2017, far higher than the number recorded by National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association data.",
      "In January, he and four colleagues concluded that the economic damaged caused by wind erosion and dust is four times higher than previously calculated and more than $154 billion a year.",
      "Martin said a cold front moved through the area of the pileup after it had been warm and dry for six hours. Winds that reached 70 miles per hour (113 kph) kicked up dust that then became trapped in the cold front.",
      "\u201cThat's when you get that classic wall of dust,\" he said.",
      "As blowing dust cut visibility on the road to almost zero, drivers slowed down, causing collisions, authorities said.",
      "A preliminary investigation found that 71 vehicles were involved, said Kansas Highway Patrol spokesperson April McCollum. Aerial photos showed at least 10 were semis.",
      "\u201cIt was hard to even keep your eyes open outside because there was so much dust in the air,\u201d said Jeremy Martin, the National Weather Service meteorologist in charge in Goodland. \u201cIt kind of stung to even breathe out in it.\u201d",
      "Similar conditions in eastern Colorado prompted the Colorado State Patrol to warn drivers: \u201cZero visibility due to high winds and blowing dirt.\u201d",
      "\u201cYou couldn\u2019t see,\u201d said Jerry Burkhart, the fire and emergency services chief in Lamar, Colorado. \u201cThe best thing to do is get way off the road in a parking lot or something like that.\u201d",
      "Martin said it's hard to tell how thick dust is from a distance, so motorists often don't know they won't able to see until they're in it.",
      "Weather Service forecasters also said some of the advice for motorists in a dust storm is counter-intuitive. Michael Anand, a NWS meteorologist in Albuquerque, said motorists should pull off the road as safely as possible, turn off all lights and never use their high beams.",
      "\u201cYou don\u2019t want people behind you to think you\u2019re going in the road,\u201d Martin said. \u201cThat light from your tail light might be the only thing they can see. They\u2019re thinking the road suddenly curves.\u201d",
      "High winds make cars harder to control, and a dust storm coats the road with fine particles that slow breaking, and drivers panic, Tong said.",
      "He said dust storms are frequent and widespread enough across the U.S. that states should test prospective drivers on what to do in a dust storm on license exams.",
      "\u201cThat could be, actually, a very easy way to educate drivers,\u201d he said.",

      "PARIS -- Hey, America: Give the Statue of Liberty back to France.",
      "So says a French politician who is making headlines in his country for suggesting that the U.S. is no longer worthy of the monument, which was a gift from France nearly 140 years ago.",
      "Rapha\u00ebl Glucksmann, as a member of the European Parliament and co-president of a small left-wing party in France, can't claim to speak for all of his compatriots.",
      "But his assertion in a speech this weekend that some Americans \u201chave chosen to switch to the side of the tyrants\u201d reflects the broad shockwaves that U.S. President Donald Trump's seismic shifts in foreign and domestic policy are triggering in France and elsewhere in Europe.",
      "\u201cGive us back the Statue of Liberty,\u201d Glucksmann told supporters of his Public Place party, who applauded and whistled, on Sunday.",
      "\u201cIt was our gift to you. But apparently you despise her. So she will be happy here with us,\u201d Glucksmann said.",
      "The White House brushed back on the comments Monday, saying France instead should still be \u201cgrateful\u201d for U.S. support during World War I and World War II. Glucksmann, in turn, then shot back that French gratitude for Americans' wartime sacrifices is \u201ceternal,\u201d but added: \u201cIf the free world no longer interests your government, then we will take up the torch, here in Europe.\"",
      "\u201cNo one, of course, will come and steal the Statue of Liberty,\u201d he wrote in X posts. \u201cThe statue is yours. But what it embodies belongs to everyone.\u201d",
      "Dream on.",
      "UNESCO, the United Nations' cultural arm that has the statue on its list of World Heritage treasures, notes that the iconic monument is U.S. government property.",
      "It was initially envisaged as a monumental gesture of French-American friendship to mark the 100th anniversary of the July 4, 1776, Declaration of Independence.",
      "But a war that erupted in 1870 between France and German states led by Prussia diverted the energies of the monument's designer, French sculptor Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric-Auguste Bartholdi.",
      "The gift also took time to be funded, with a decision made that the French would pay for the statue and Americans would cover the costs of its pedestal.",
      "Transported in 350 pieces from France, the statue was officially unveiled on Oct. 28, 1886.",
      "No. French-U.S. relations would have to drop off a cliff before Glucksmann found support from French President Emmanuel Macron's government.",
      "For the moment, the French president is treading a fine line \u2014 trying to work with Trump and temper some of his policy shifts on the one hand, but also pushing back hard against some White House decisions, notably Trump's tariff hikes.",
      "Macron has let his prime minister, Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou, play the role of being a more critical voice. Bayrou tore into the \u201cbrutality\u201d that was shown to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy during his White House visit and suggested that Trump's administration risked handing victory to Russia when it paused military aid to Ukraine.",
      "Glucksmann's party has been even more critical, posting accusations on its website that Trump is wielding power in an \u201cauthoritarian\u201d manner and is \u201cpreparing to deliver Ukraine on a silver platter\u201d to Russia.",
      "In his speech, Glucksmann referenced New York poet Emma Lazarus' words about the statue, the \u201cmighty woman with a torch\u201d who promised a home for the \u201chuddled masses yearning to breathe free.\u201d",
      "\u201cToday, this land is ceasing to be what it was,\u201d Glucksmann said.",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt was asked Monday about Glucksmann's comments, and responded that the U.S. would \u201cabsolutely not\u201d be parting with the landmark in New York Harbor.",
      "\u201cMy advice to that unnamed low-level French politician would be to remind them that it\u2019s only because of the United States of America that the French are not speaking German right now,\" Leavitt said, apparently referencing the U.S. fight with Allied powers to free France from Nazi occupation during World War II and alongside France during World War I. \"They should be very grateful.\u201d",
      "But the debt of gratitude runs both ways. Leavitt skipped past France's key role in supporting the future United States during its war for independence from the United Kingdom.",
      "In his subsequent follow-up, Glucksmann said that his call for Lady Liberty to travel back across the Atlantic to France had been intended as \u201ca wake-up call.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe all in Europe love this nation to which we know we owe so much,\" he posted. \u201cIt will rise again. You will rise again. We are counting on you.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "It\u2019s a local threat to some and a full-on invasion to President Donald Trump",
      "CARACAS, Venezuela -- Debates over President Donald Trump\u2019s hardline migration policies are focused on the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua, to some a ruthless transnational criminal organization and to others the pretext for an overhyped anti-migrant narrative.",
      "Trump labeled the Tren de Aragua an invading force on Saturday when he invoked the Alien Enemies Act, a little-used authority from 1798 that allows the president to deport any noncitizen during wartime. Hours later, the Trump administration transferred hundreds of immigrants to El Salvador even as a federal judge issued an order temporarily barring the deportations. Flights were in the air when the ruling came down.",
      "The Alien Enemies Act requires a president to declare the United States at war, giving him extraordinary powers to detain or remove foreigners to whom immigration or criminal laws otherwise protect. It had been used only three times \u2014 the last time to justify the detention of Japanese-American civilians during World War II.",
      "The Trump administration has not identified the more than 200 immigrants deported, provided any evidence they are in fact members of Tren de Aragua or that they committed any crimes in the United States.",
      "From the heartland to major cities like New York and Chicago, the gang has been blamed for sex trafficking, drug smuggling and police shootings, as well as the exploitation of the nearly 1 million Venezuelan migrants have crossed into the U.S. in recent years. Trump told Congress this month that a Venezuelan migrant found guilty of murdering 22-year-old nursing student Laken Riley on the University of Georgia campus was a member of the gang.",
      "The size of the gang is unclear as is the extent to which its actions are coordinated across state lines and national borders.",
      "The Venezuelan gang entered U.S. political discourse after footage from a security camera surfaced on social media last summer showing heavily armed men entering an apartment in the Denver suburb of Aurora shortly before a fatal shooting outside. In response, Trump vowed to \u201c liberate Aurora \u201d from Venezuelans he falsely said were \u201ctaking over the whole town.\u201d",
      "The city initially downplayed concerns. But most of the apartment complex was closed under an emergency order last month after officials said they suspected Tren de Aragua members in the kidnapping and assault of two residents.",
      "Most of the men seen in the video have been arrested, with Immigration and Customs Enforcement accusing them of gang membership.",
      "The Tren, which means \u201ctrain\u201d in Spanish, traces its origin more than a decade ago to an infamously lawless prison with hardened criminals in the central state of Aragua. It has expanded in recent years as more than 8 million Venezuelans fled economic turmoil under President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro\u2019s rule and migrated to other parts of Latin America or the U.S.",
      "Countries such as Peru and Colombia \u2014 all with large populations of Venezuelan migrants \u2014 have accused the group of being behind a spree of violence in a region that has long had some of the highest murder rates in the world. Some of its crimes have spread panic in poor neighborhoods, where the gang extorts local businesses and illegally charges residents for \u201cprotection.\u201d",
      "The gang operates as a loose network in the U.S. Tattoos, which are commonly used by Central American gangs, aren't required for those affiliated with the Tren, said Ronna Risquez, a Venezuelan journalist who wrote a 2023 book about the gang\u2019s origins.",
      "On his first day in office, Trump he took steps to designate the gang a \u201cforeign terrorist organization\u201d alongside several Mexican drug cartels. The Biden administration had sanctioned the gang and offered $12 million in rewards for the arrest of three of its leaders.",
      "Trump\u2019s executive order Saturday accused the gang of working closely with top Maduro officials \u2014 most notably the former vice president and one-time governor of Aragua state, Tareck El Aissami, \u2014 to infiltrate migration flows, flood the U.S. with cocaine and plot against the country.",
      "\u201cThe result is a hybrid criminal state that is perpetrating an invasion of and predatory incursion into the United States, and which poses a substantial danger to the United States,\u201d Trump\u2019s executive order alleged.",
      "Wes Tabor, who headed the Drug Enforcement Administration's office in Venezuela when the gang first came onto law enforcement radar, said Trump's decision to give the DEA and other federal agencies authority to carry out immigrant arrests is a \u201cforce multiplier\u201d that will curtail the Tren's activities in the U.S.",
      "Tabor said authorities need to build a robust database like it did when combating El Salvador's MS-13 containing biometric data, arrest information and intelligence from foreign law enforcement partners.",
      "\u201cWe have to use a hammer on an ant because if we don\u2019t it will get out of control,\u201d said Tabor. \u201cWe need to smash it now.\u201d",
      "In Venezuela, officials originally expressed bafflement at the U.S. interest in the Tren, claiming it had dismantled the gang after retaking control of the prison where the group was born.",
      "As Trump's immigration crackdown has intensified, they've conditioned their cooperation with U.S. deportation flights on progress in other areas in the long-strained bilateral relationship.",
      "Last month, authorities gave a hero's welcome to some 190 Venezuelan migrants deported by Trump, accusing the U.S. of spreading an \"ill-intentioned\u201d and \u201cfalse\u201d narrative about the Tren in the U.S. They said most Venezuelan immigrants are decent, hard-working people and that U.S. officials were looking to stigmatize the South American nation.",
      "Over the weekend they protested the use of Trump\u2019s invocation of the wartime rules, likening it to the \u201cdarkest episodes in human history, from slavery to the horror of the Nazi concentration camps.\u201d",

      "ATLANTA -- A judge has ordered Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis to pay more than $54,000 in attorneys' fees and to turn over documents after finding that her office violated Georgia's Open Records Act.",
      "Attorney Ashleigh Merchant represents former Trump campaign staffer Michael Roman, one of the 18 people indicted in August 2023 along with President Donald Trump on allegations that they illegally tried to overturn Trump's 2020 election loss in Georgia. Merchant sued in January 2024, alleging that the district attorney's office had failed to turn over public records she had requested.",
      "Fulton County Superior Court Judge Rachel Krause found that the failures to comply with the records law \u201cwere intentional, not done in good faith, and were substantially groundless and vexatious.\u201d Because Willis and her office \u201clacked substantial justification\u201d for not complying, Merchant is entitled to attorneys' fees and litigation expenses totaling just over $54,000, Krause found.",
      "Krause ordered Willis to search for and turn over all records responsive to Merchant's requests. The documents and payment are to be delivered within 30 days of Friday's order.",
      "A spokesperson for Willis' office said Monday that they plan to appeal the order.",
      "Merchant posted Krause's order on the social media platform X, writing, \u201cProud that we have judges willing to hold people in power accountable when they ignore the law!!!!\u201d",
      "Willis' office was \u201copenly hostile\u201d to Merchant and testimony showed that Merchant's requests \u201cwere handled differently than other requests,\u201d Krause wrote in her order. Open records officer Dexter Bond said during a hearing that he refused to communicate by phone with Merchant, even though it was his regular practice to call the requester if a request was unclear.",
      "Treating Merchant's requests this way \u201cindicates a lack of good faith,\u201d Krause wrote.",
      "Among the records Merchant sought were reports provided to Willis' office by companies hired \u201cto track the impact of Willis' statements to the media and whether such statements were viewed favorably by the public,\u201d according to a court filing. The filing says Willis began contracting with those companies just before she and her office sought to indict Trump, Roman and others.",
      "Merchant also asked for a copy of the non-disclosure or confidentiality agreement that employees of the district attorney's office are required to sign, as well as a list of attorneys Willis had hired.",
      "The Georgia Court of Appeals in December ruled that Willis and her office could not continue to prosecute the election interference case against Trump and others. Willis in January asked the Georgia Supreme Court to review and reverse that ruling, and the high court has not yet said whether it will take up the case.",
      "The intermediate appeals court's ruling was based on an \u201cappearance of impropriety\u201d created by a romantic relationship Willis had with special prosecutor Nathan Wade, whom she had hired to lead the case. It was a bombshell filing by Merchant in January 2024 that first exposed that relationship publicly, alleging that the relationship created a conflict of interest that should disqualify Willis and her office from the case.",
      "A grand jury in Atlanta indicted Trump and 18 others in August 2023, using the state\u2019s anti-racketeering law to accuse them of participating in a wide-ranging scheme to illegally try to overturn Trump\u2019s narrow 2020 loss to Democrat Joe Biden in Georgia. The alleged scheme included Trump\u2019s call to Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger urging him to help find enough votes to beat Biden. Four people have pleaded guilty. Trump and the others, including Roman, have pleaded not guilty.",
      "Even if the Georgia Supreme Court agrees to hear the case and eventually rules in Willis\u2019 favor, it seems unlikely that she will be able to prosecute Trump while he's the sitting president. But there are 14 other defendants, including Roman, who still face charges in the case.",

      "\u201cThere\u2019s no predictability or fairness about destroyed houses,\u201d Shufran said. \u201cThere\u2019s only two options for the homes in our neighborhood: standing or burned to the ground.\u201d",
      "Over 400 homes were severely damaged or destroyed in the outbreak of wildfires that started Friday in Oklahoma. At least four people died due to the fires or high winds, including a person who died in a vehicle accident as a result of poor visibility due to dust or smoke, officials said.",
      "While calm weather over the weekend helped crews get a handle on most wildfires burning across Texas and Oklahoma, forecasters at the National Weather Service said extremely critical fire weather conditions were expected Tuesday over an area spanning from southeastern New Mexico through the Texas Panhandle and into western Oklahoma.",
      "\u201cThese fires, once they get started, become really hard to stop,\" said Keith Merckx of Oklahoma Forestry Services. \"They move more quickly than our resources can keep up with.\u201d",
      "He said officials will be returning their attention toward western and central Oklahoma, where high winds are expected to pick back up again over the next few days.",
      "In Stillwater, a city of about 50,000 about 65 miles (100 kilometers) northeast of Oklahoma City and home to Oklahoma State University, over 70 homes were destroyed by wildfires. The toll included Shufran's house, which burned to the ground in a matter of hours.",

      "Top Democrats on the House Judiciary and House Oversight committees have filed a lengthy Freedom of Information Act request about the Department of Government Efficiency",
      "WASHINGTON -- Top Democrats on the House Judiciary and House Oversight committees have filed a lengthy Freedom of Information Act request questioning whether the Trump administration\u2019s DOGE Service is operating \u201coutside the bounds of federal law,\u201d The Associated Press has learned.",
      "Rep. Jamie Raskin of Maryland and Rep. Gerald Connolly of Virginia are seeking detailed information about the authority of the Department of Government Efficiency Service, including billionaire Trump adviser Elon Musk and some 40 other people, to carry out firings of federal workers and dismantling of federal agencies.",
      "They also are requesting detailed information about DOGE's access to sensitive data, its use of artificial intelligence, the resumes and training of its staff and its communications related to Musk-held entities including SpaceX, Starlink and Tesla.",
      "\u201cThe Administration and Mr. Musk have hidden behind a veil of secrecy as they systematically dismantle the federal government of the United States,\" the Democrats wrote in a letter to DOGE administrator Amy Gleason accompanying the FOIA request, which was obtained by the AP. \"The American people deserve answers, and we are committed to using every tool at our disposal to expose the truth about DOGE\u2019s operations.\"",
      "They are seeking expedited review of the request, with a response within 20 days.",
      "The FOIA request is the latest in an escalating confrontation between Congress and the executive branch as President Donald Trump is rapidly slashing routine aspects of the federal government by doing away with thousands of workers and unwinding various longstanding agencies and services.",
      "The Oversight Committee Democrats have already issued a formal request for information from the Republican president's administration on Musk's potential conflicts of interest, which is pending. Their attempt to subpoena Musk was rejected by committee Republicans, who hold the majority in Congress.",
      "While generally anyone can file a FOIA request, the Democrats on the panels are utilizing the avenues at their disposal as the minority party to press for oversight of the Republican administration any way they can. It's also a potential step toward more binding measures, including legal action.",
      "In the FOIA request, Raskin and Connolly, who are the ranking Democrats on the committees, wrote that the information is necessary \u201cto provide answers to the many open questions and an explanation to the public.\"",
      "They said, \u201cThere exist possible questions concerning the government\u2019s integrity regarding DOGE\u2019s operations, formation, and activity, which form the basis of this request, as many of DOGE\u2019s actions may be outside the bounds of federal law.\"",
      "It\u2019s unclear if the Trump administration will respond.",
      "Trump and Musk have shown little regard for the protests coming from Democrats \u2014 and some Republicans \u2014 in Congress as their teams march across the federal government. Musk has vowed transparency, but the Democrats noted he has met privately with House and Senate Republicans.",
      "The Trump administration is purging employees, shuttering federal agencies and otherwise disrupting operations in the name of rooting out waste, fraud and abuse. Some 100 lawsuits have been filed, with judges slowing and stopping some actions, while allowing others.",
      "In the sweeping request, the Democrats seek four main types of information about the authority involved with DOGE\u2019s activity: its access to sensitive data; the guidance and decision-making around its firings of federal employees; the potential conflicts of interest around its leadership; and its internal communications.",
      "They seek the names, job titles and qualifications of DOGE staffers who have \u201cbeen granted access to personally identifiable or sensitive information\" since inauguration day, Jan. 20, and their purpose for doing so.",
      "Additionally, they want to know about the various computer programs, including but \u201cnot limited to, artificial intelligence (AI) and large language models (LLMs), your agency is using to store, process or analyze personally identifiable or sensitive information or data.\"",
      "The request seeks all DOGE directives, guidance and analyses around the firing of federal workers, including the dismissal of inspectors general, and the undoing of various government agencies, including the U.S. Agency for International Development, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the Department of Education and others.",
      "Democrats are also requesting information about DOGE's authority to direct and execute these directives as well as details around the funding of DOGE operations.",
      "Musk, DOGE administrator Gleason and some 40 other employees are listed in the FOIA request, which seeks information about their resumes, salaries, any conflict of interest waivers and any non-disclosure agreements involving their employment.",
      "The request also seeks all communication from those workers, including via text message, and various messaging platforms, and specifically around key words including Musk-related entities SpaceX, Starlink, Twitter, Tesla and others.",

      "Thousands of spectators have lined the streets of an Arkansas city known its St. Patrick's Day parade for more than two decades for an unusual reason",
      "HOT SPRINGS, Ark. -- Cities like New York and Chicago boast some of the largest St. Patrick's Day parades, attracting thousands of revelers and plenty of green beer.",
      "But a city in Arkansas has gained popularity over the years with its parade for an entirely different reason. The city of Hot Springs, a resort town known for its mineral-rich waters, promotes its 98-foot (30-meter) route as the World's Shortest St. Patrick's Day Parade.",
      "Thousands of people lined the streets Monday to watch the parade, which has been one of the city's biggest draws for more than two decades. Over the years, the event has gained the attention of celebrities, and this year, actor Valerie Bertinelli and rap icon Flavor Flav participated.",
      "Steve Arrison, CEO of Visit Hot Springs, said the idea began in 2003 when he and a group of friends were at a downtown restaurant \u201cdrinking adult beverages\u201d and the topic of St. Patrick's Day came up.",
      "\u201cWe got to talking and said, well, why don't we have a parade?\u201d Arrison said.",
      "The parade began the following year and drew about 1,500 people. More than 30,000 people watch the parade each year, organizers say.",
      "For the world's shortest, the parade packs in a lot. They'll have 40 different floats, and participants included 100 members of a group of Elvis Presley impersonators known as the International Order of the Marching Irish Elvi.",
      "Another float featured the local chapter of the International Society of Helen Ropers, with participants dressed up as the character from the 1970s sitcom, \u201cThree's Company.\u201d",
      "The parade has also featured a celebrity grand marshal and parade starter, and over the years has included familiar faces such as actor Kevin Bacon, \u201cCheers\u201d star George Wendt and country music star Justin Moore. This year, Bertinelli was the grand marshal and Flav, the official starter.",
      "\u201cWe're not doing small stuff here. This is big,\u201d Bertinelli said before the parade.",
      "The parade even created its own green version of the signature clock necklace that Flav, a founding member of Public Enemy, is known for wearing. Flav, who celebrated his birthday on Sunday, danced along the route, enthusiastically greeting parade watchers.",
      "\u201cI can have fun in a five-foot parade. Ninety-eight feet gives me a little bit more time to have more fun,\u201d Flav, said before the parade.",
      "The Dallas Cowboys cheerleaders, who have participated in the parade for the past several years, sat in the back of cars and threw beads to crowds along the route.",
      "The parade includes other events, including a concert and a \u201cBlarney Stone kissing contest.\u201d Before the parade kicked off there was an official measuring of the route to verify its shortness. A bugler from Oaklawn, a Hot Springs horse track and casino, marked the start.",
      "\u201cI've been to Chicago, I've been to Savannah, Georgia. I like this one better than any of them,\" said Chuck Last, from Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin, who has gone to the past two parades.",
      "Other parades have tried to lay claim to being the shortest in recent years, including two cities in New York that dueled over who had the shortest parade. Another 78-pace parade was planned in Bemidji, Minnesota, on Monday.",
      "The Hot Springs parade's organizers also keep up a feud with another parade in Adamsville, Rhode Island that claims its 89-foot (27-meter) route is the shortest. But Arrison dismisses their claim, noting that city's parade is held on the day before St. Patrick's Day.",
      "Arrison also notes that the Hot Springs event has copyrighted the title \u201cWorld's Shortest St. Patrick's Day Parade.\u201d",

      "A Hindu temple in Chino Hills, California, was desecrated on March 7 with anti-Hindu graffiti, which also targeted Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi",
      "CHINO HILLS, Calif. -- The recent desecration of an iconic Hindu temple in Southern California with anti-Hindu and anti-Indian government graffiti has heightened concerns among South Asian groups following a slew of such incidents over the past year.",
      "Devotees who arrived early morning on March 8 at the BAPS Shri Swaminarayan Mandir in Chino Hills were shocked to find the words \u201cHindustan Murdabad,\u201d which means \u201cdeath to\u201d or \u201cdown with\u201d Hindus and India, scrawled on a pink stone sign bearing the temple\u2019s name, said Mehul Patel, a volunteer with the organization.",
      "Expletive-laden graffiti targeting India\u2019s Prime Minister Narendra Modi was written on one of the outer brick walls and abutting sidewalk, he said. San Bernardino Sheriff\u2019s officials have said they are investigating the incident as a hate crime and have not identified any suspects yet.",
      "Patel said the incident \u201cinvoked a sense of fear\u201d among community members. The impact was felt as far away as India, where most major media outlets reported the incident, and India's External Affairs ministry condemned the vandalism.",
      "\u201cWe condemn such despicable acts in the strongest terms,\u201d said ministry spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal. \"We call upon the local law enforcement authorities to take stringent action against those responsible for these acts, and also ensure adequate security to places of worship.\u201d",
      "Patel said the vandalized temple had nearly 1,000 visitors every day, with thousands of people gathering during Diwali and temple festivals.",
      "\u201cWe do have security protocols in place, but such a violation still makes you think twice about how safe you really are, especially if you have young children,\" Patel said.",
      "The majestic temple, the largest in California, sits on a 20-acre lot along a freeway, its arches and domes carved out of pink sandstone and interior decked with white Italian marble. In October 2023, the organization built in Robbinsville, New Jersey, the largest Hindu temple outside India in the modern era. The Swaminarayan sect, a branch of Hinduism, oversees more than 1,300 temples and 5,000 centers around the world, according to the group's website.",
      "This is not the first time the global Bochasanwasi Shri Akshar Purushottam Swaminarayan Sanstha, known as BAPS, has been hit by vandals. The organization\u2019s temple in Melville, New York, was tagged with similar writing on Sept. 16. Nine days later, their temple near Sacramento was hit, and there was also an incident at the Newark, California, temple in December 2023. Those incidents are also being investigated as hate crimes.",
      "The denigration of Modi, under whom Hindu nationalism has surged in India, appears to be a common thread in these vandalism incidents across the country. Other non-BAPS Hindu temples in the U.S. have also been attacked recently. In Hayward, California, Vijay\u2019s Sherawali Temple, dedicated to the Hindu Goddess Durga and run by a family of immigrants from Fiji, was vandalized in January 2024 with graffiti calling Modi a \u201cterrorist\u201d and with the words \u201cKhalistan Zindabad\u201d (Long live Khalistan).",
      "Khalistan is the name by which Sikh separatists refer to a sovereign state they hope to create in Indian state of Punjab, birthplace of Sikhism. A violent Khalistani insurgency in India was quelled by the government in 1984; India has declared it a terrorist movement. Activists in the diaspora are currently holding a nonbinding referendum across the United States to create an independent Khalistan; voting will take place in Los Angeles on March 23.",
      "In the summer of 2023, tensions escalated between India and Canada over allegations by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau that the Indian government had a hand in the assassination of Hardeep Singh Nijjar, a Canadian citizen who was shot dead outside a Sikh temple in Surrey, British Columbia. In November 2023, the U.S. Department of Justice stated that an Indian government official plotted to assassinate Gurpatwant Singh Pannun, a Sikh separatist leader, in New York who is spearheading the Khalistan referendum. In August, the FBI opened an investigation into a drive-by shooting that targeted Satinder Pal Singh Raju, a close associate of Nijjar, in Yolo County, California.",
      "The temple vandalism incidents in Northern California last year were condemned by local Sikh groups. Sikhs in the diaspora and in India are divided on the issue of Khalistan.",
      "Immediately after the incident in Southern California, the Coalition of Hindus of North America posted on X raising the possibility of a connection between the tagging incident and the upcoming Khalistan referendum in Los Angeles. Pushpita Prasad, a spokesperson for the group, said Thursday that regardless of who committed the crime, \u201cthis repeated assault on the freedom of Hindus to gather in their place of worship is unacceptable.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe go to a place of worship to find solace,\u201d she said. \u201cIf that place becomes a target, how do you find solace there?\u201d",
      "Prasad called for a robust discussion on what is driving these attacks against Hindu temples and acknowledge that anti-Hindu hate exists. She called for treating Hindu places of worship equally.",
      "Another South Asian group pointed out the perils of jumping to conclusions about perpetrators of a crime before an investigation has concluded. Without evidence, such assumptions only serve to further divide communities, said Prachi Patankar, board member of the interfaith Savera Coalition. Her group represents Indian Americans who are Hindu, Sikh, Muslim, Dalit or the people formerly regarded as \u201cuntouchables\u201d in the caste system, and those unaffiliated with religion.",
      "\u201cSuch incidents should never be used to scapegoat other minority religious communities such as the Sikh community, because it can lead to further criminalization or repression of the entire community,\u201d she said.",
      "Patel said it is important for the public to understand that Hindus are not a monolith and the Chino Hills temple is a nonprofit that does not represent any single government, leader or country.",
      "\u201cWe are a Hindu temple in the United States,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are Indian Americans. But people who are not of Indian origin who practice Hinduism worship here as well.\u201d",
      "He hopes surveillance video, which showed two suspects in the act of scoping the area and tagging the property, will help apprehend them.",
      "Members of the organization gathered in front of their temple on March 9 where a priest chanted the \u201cShanthi Path,\u201d a blessing and prayer for peace.",
      "\u201cWe prayed not just for our community, but also for the perpetrators,\u201d Patel said. \u201cWe believe in the right of people to express themselves, but to get their message out in a peaceful and not in a hateful way.\u201d",

      "In court papers over the weekend, lawyers for the Justice Department also blamed his move on overcrowded facilities in the Northeast.",
      "Khalil made the statement about bedbugs in an exhibit attached to court papers in which his lawyers asked that he be freed on bail while the courts decide whether his arrest violated the First Amendment.",
      "The lawyers have also asked a judge to widen the effect of any order to stop the U.S. government from \u201carresting, detaining, and removing noncitizens who engage in constitutionally protected expressive activity in the United States in support of Palestinian rights or critical of Israel.\u201d",
      "In his declaration, Khalil said he was put in a van when he was taken away from the Elizabeth facility and he asked if he was being returned to FBI headquarters in Manhattan, where he was taken immediately after his arrest.",
      "\u201cI was told, \u2018no, we are going to JFK Airport.\u2019 I was afraid they were trying to deport me,\u201d he recalled.",
      "Of his time spent at the Elizabeth facility, he wrote: \u201cI was in a waiting room with about ten other people. We slept on the ground. Even though it was cold inside the room, there were no beds, mattresses, or blankets.\u201d",
      "In the weekend court papers, lawyers for the Justice Department gave a detailed description of Khalil's March 8 arrest and his transport from Manhattan to Elizabeth and then to Kennedy International Airport in New York the next day for his transfer to Louisiana, where he has been held since.",
      "\u201cKhalil could not be housed at Elizabeth Detention Facility long-term due to a bedbug issue, so he remained there until his flight to Louisiana,\u201d the lawyers wrote. They said he was at the facility from 2:20 a.m. until 11:30 a.m. on March 9.",
      "The lawyers have asked that legal issues be addressed by federal judges in New Jersey or Louisiana rather than New York. A Manhattan federal judge has not yet ruled on the request.",

Smith said a rise in the Bay Area's Hindu and Buddhist communities has made sea burials more popular, and he now does more than 200 a year \u2014 and that's helping him pay off his $250,000 boat engine.",
      "\u201cThe bills keep going, whether I\u2019ve got a fishery or not,\u201d said Smith, who runs Riptide Sportfishing in Half Moon Bay, California. \u201cThere\u2019s no season on when people die.\u201d",
      "California's sport and commercial fishermen have been walloped by two years of salmon closures and are bracing for a potential third, which they blame on a years-earlier drought and state and federal water management policies they say have made it tough for the species to thrive. The closures have taken a toll on people's livelihoods in coastal communities where salmon, fishermen say, is a special fish.",
      "Salmon must swim upstream to lay their eggs, and young fish make their way out to the ocean through California's waterways \u2014 something done more easily when cool water flows are abundant. The fishery has long been strained and the Pacific Fishery Management Council, which manages West Coast fisheries, said there will be very limited salmon fishing this year in California, if at all. A decision is due in April.",
      "The dim outlook comes as President Donald Trump has ordered officials to find ways to put \u201cpeople over fish\u201d and route more water to farmers in California\u2019s crop-rich Central Valley and residents of its densely-populated cities. Trump has professed his love for farmers and contends too much heed is paid to the tiny delta smelt, a federally-threatened species seen as an indicator of the health of California's Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta.",
      "But salmon depend on this same water system for their survival. And some in the fishing community are wondering if fishermen aren't people, too.",
      "\u201cWe are people that are hardworking and it's our jobs on the line,\u201d said Sarah Bates, a commercial fishing captain in San Francisco. She said local markets have been devastated by the salmon closures and Bay Area restaurants aren't snapping up halibut or other catch as they did salmon.",
      "The history of commercial salmon fishing in California dates back more than a century, and in the 1970s and 1980s the fishery thrived off the state's coast. Over time, salmon fishing has declined with swings in stocks amid volatile weather patterns in a drought-prone state and water management decisions about when surface water, and how much of it, should flow to farms, burgeoning cities and the ecologically-sensitive bay delta.",
      "California's salmon fishing industry includes commercial fleets and charters that take anglers out for recreation.",
      "Jamie O\u2019Neill, owner of Seattle-based Dock Street Brokers, said many of California's commercial salmon fishermen are getting out of the business, selling their permits or simply letting them expire. Permits now sell for a fraction of what they used to, and there are fewer than 900 permits compared to 1,200 in 2010, he said.",
      "Charter operators, meanwhile, have branched out to host boat tours and party cruises, especially since short trips require little fuel and can help offset the cost of boat maintenance.",
      "While fishermen can still catch halibut, cod and striped bass along the extensive Pacific coastline, they say without the all-popular King Salmon, anglers just aren\u2019t coming like before. Each fish requires a different bait and technique, and a fast-swimming salmon is a fighter that anglers aspire to catch.",
      "\u201cOne is hamburger, and one is filet mignon,\u201d said Andy Guiliano, whose sportfishing boat the Pacific Pearl in Emeryville has expanded its historic tour offerings since the closure. \u201cIt makes the cash register ring.\u201d",

      "The Taliban\u2019s chief spokesman, Zabihullah Mujahid, posted a statement on his official X account this month saying the dignity, honor and legal rights of women were a priority for the country, in accordance with Islamic law and Afghan culture and traditions.

But his call for impeachment \u2014 a rare step that is usually taken only in cases of grave ethical or criminal misconduct \u2014 represents an intensifying clash between the judicial and executive branches.",

Boasberg in Washington, as an unelected \u201ctroublemaker and agitator\u201d in a post on Truth Social, his social media platform. Boasberg recently issued an order blocking deportation flights under wartime authorities from an 18th century law that Trump invoked to carry out his plans.",

      "She fled Iran following the country\u2019s disputed 2009 presidential election and became a U.S. citizen in October 2019. In an opening statement last week, a prosecutor said she will testify about why she stands up to the Iranian regime and why she \u201crefuses to back down.\u201d",

      "He testified for the government after pleading guilty to multiple charges in Brooklyn and Manhattan courts, including attempted murder, conspiracy and weapons charges.",
      "Mehdiyev, testifying in a monotone, said he was paid $30,000 of the $160,000 he expected to be paid for killing Alinejad. To prepare for the job, he took photographs and video footage outside her Brooklyn residence, where he did surveillance for hours a day sometimes.",
      "He testified that he reached out to her on social media, complimenting her as \u201cthe best journalist.\u201d",
      "When asked why he reached out, he answered: \u201cI was trying to have a conversation with her so I can get into her life. ... Because I was trying to get the easy way to kill her.\u201d",

      "\u201cYou might find this hard to believe \u2014 but for simply posting videos of myself showing my hair and encouraging women in Iran to do the same, the regime sent a man with an AK-47 to my house in Brooklyn to kill me,\u201d she said.",
      "It was a theme delivered to the jury by Assistant U.S. Attorney Jacob Gutwillig at the trial's start.",

      "After Secretary of State Marco Rubio determined that Ambassador Ebrahim Rasool was no longer welcome in the U.S. and posted his decision Friday on social media, South African embassy staff were summoned to the State Department and given a formal diplomatic note explaining the decision, the department said.",

      "CHICAGO -- Federal immigration agents violated the rights of 22 people, including a U.S. citizen, in immigration enforcement arrests during the first weeks of President Donald Trump\u2019s second term, Chicago activists and attorneys alleged Monday.",
      "The arrests allegedly violate a 2022 agreement between Chicago groups and the federal government detailing how U.S. Immigration Customs and Enforcement officers can make \u201c collateral arrests,\u201d where agents detain others besides those being targeted. The agreement, following a lawsuit over 2018 immigration sweeps, covers Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Missouri, Kentucky and Wisconsin, which are under the ICE office in Chicago.",
      "\u201cEvery time you hear from this administration about how they're rounding up gang members, terrorists, the worst of the worst, you need to take a dose of reality,\" said Mark Fleming, an attorney with the National Immigrant Justice Center, said at a news conference. \"You need to dig deeper to understand who exactly they are arresting.\u201d",
      "The NIJC detailed alleged violations in a federal complaint filed last week on behalf of advocacy groups in Chicago. Among other things, the agreement says ICE agents can make a warrantless arrest only when they have evidence that an individual is likely to escape.",
      "The groups are seeking the release of two people who remain detained, sanctions against arresting officers and more transparency in how the agency conducts its operations, among other things.",
      "ICE declined comment Monday, citing pending litigation.",
      "Aggressive immigration enforcement has been central to the Trump administration's agenda, particularly in places such as Chicago that are often called sanctuary cities because they limit cooperation between federal immigration agents and local police. To send a message, the Trump administration gathered top immigration officials in Chicago in January to kick off an enforcement operation with cameras rolling live.",
      "But there have been limited details on how the arrests are taking place and what practices are being used.",
      "While the 2022 settlement applied only to six states, the new federal complaint could have nationwide implications. For instance, advocates in other states could join the effort .",
      "Of those arrested, one was deported, 19 were released on bond and one was a U.S. citizen who was released after being handcuffed for hours. Most in the complaint do not have criminal records aside from one person with a driving under the influence charge, according to attorneys.",
      "Those detained include Abel Orozco Ortega, a 47-year-old man who was arrested Jan. 26 while returning to his suburban Chicago home after getting tamales for his family. According to the complaint, ICE was actually looking for one of his sons in his 20s who has the same name. Ortega, who is in the U.S. illegally, remains detained in Indiana.",
      "Family members said Monday that Ortega has no criminal record. His wife has breast cancer, they said, and, they have struggled to make mortgage payments without him.",

      "In the hours leading up to Louisiana's first nitrogen gas execution, attorneys for the inmate are hoping for a last-minute court ruling to halt the death penalty from being carried out",
      "BATON ROUGE, La. -- On the day that Louisiana's first execution in 15 years is scheduled to take place, attorneys for the inmate are hoping for a last-minute court ruling to halt the death penalty from being carried out.",
      "Jessie Hoffman Jr., 46, is scheduled to be put to death Tuesday evening using nitrogen gas, which would be the first time Louisiana has ever used the method. Nitrogen gas has been used just four other times to execute a person on death row in the United States, all in Alabama \u2014 which is the only other state where there is a protocol for the specific method.",
      "Hoffman's attorneys say the method is unconstitutional, violating the Eighth Amendment that prohibits cruel and unusual punishment. They also say that it infringes on Hoffman's freedom to practice religion, specifically his Buddhist breathing and meditation in the moments leading up to his death.",
      "Louisiana officials say that it is past time for the state to deliver justice that was promised to the families of the victims, after a decade and a half hiatus on executions. Attorney General Liz Murrill says that she expects at least four people on Louisiana's death row to be executed this year.",
      "Following court battles earlier this month, attorneys for Hoffman are turning to the United States Supreme Court to halt the execution. However, last year the court declined to intervene in the nation's first nitrogen hypoxia death row execution.",
      "On Monday, Hoffman's attorneys filed a slew of additional challenges in state and federal courts as a last-ditch effort to stop the execution. A state judge will consider one of the new challenges on Tuesday morning. But with the hearing taking place just hours before Hoffman is scheduled to be put to death, attorneys will face a race against the clock.",
      "The 19th Judicial District Court judge issued a temporary restraining order \u2014 preventing the state from executing Hoffman \u2014 \u201cpending\u201d a morning hearing. Attorneys for Hoffman and the state say their understanding is that the restraining order, as it stands, expires at 10:30 a.m. (EST). However the execution is scheduled to occur in the evening, hours after the order expires.",
      "Murrill said that she expects the execution to go forward as planned and that \u201cjustice will finally be served.\u201d Hoffman was convicted of the 1996 murder of Mary \u201cMolly\u201d Elliott, a 28-year-old advertising executive, in New Orleans.",
      "Under Louisiana protocol, which is nearly identical to Alabama's, Hoffman will be strapped to a gurney and have a full-face respirator mask \u2014 similar to what is used by painters and sandblasters \u2014 fitted tightly on him. Pure nitrogen gas will then be pumped into the mask, forcing him to breathe it in and depriving him of the oxygen needed to maintain bodily functions.",
      "The nitrogen gas will be administered for at least 15 minutes or five minutes after his heart rate reaches a flatline indication on the EKG, whichever is longer.",
      "The state has maintained that the method is seemingly painless. Hoffman's attorneys argue that the method is torturous.",
      "Each inmate put to death using nitrogen in Alabama has appeared to shake and gasp to varying degrees during their executions, according to media witnesses, including AP. The reactions are involuntary movements associated with oxygen deprivation, state officials have said.",
      "Currently, four states \u2014 Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi and Oklahoma \u2014 specifically authorize execution by nitrogen hypoxia, according to records compiled by the Death Penalty Information Center.",
      "Alabama first used the lethal gas to put Kenneth Eugene Smith to death last year, marking the first time a new method had been used in the U.S. since lethal injection was introduced in 1982.",
      "In an effort to resume executions, Louisiana's GOP-dominated Legislature expanded the state\u2019s approved death penalty methods last year to include nitrogen hypoxia and electrocution. Already in place was lethal injection.",
      "Over recent decades, the number of executions nationally has declined sharply amid legal battles, a shortage of lethal injection drugs and waning public support for capital punishment. That has led a majority of states to either abolish or pause carrying out the death penalty.",

    "summary": "Ways are being developed for subsea cables to \"sense\" whether they are being disturbed or attacked.",
    "story": [
      "The diver had found the fibre optic cable lying on the seabed of the North Sea. He swam closer, until it was near enough to touch.",
      "He reached out his hand. But someone could tell he was lurking there. Someone was watching.",
      "\"He stops and just touches the cable lightly, you clearly see the signal,\" says Daniel Gerwig, global sales manager at AP Sensing, a German technology company. \"The acoustic energy which travels through the fibre is basically disturbing our signal. We can measure this disturbance.\"",
      "Multiple reports of damaged telecommunications cables in the Baltic Sea have raised alarm in recent months.",
      "So important are these cables, which carry huge volumes of internet data between countries, that Nato has launched a mission called \"Baltic Sentry\", to patrol the Baltic Sea with aircraft, warships and drones.",
      "The EU is also stepping up measures to monitor and protect cables.",
      "Despite those efforts the authorities cannot be everywhere at once.",
      "So, some companies are trying to monitor what's going on in the vicinity of any cable \u2013 by using fibre optic signals to listen out for surreptitious underwater drones, or hostile vessels dragging their anchors along the seabed.",
      "It was during tests of AP Sensing's system last year \u2013 not a real attempt at sabotage \u2013 that the diver patted his hand on the subsea cable watched over by the firm.",
      "The company also deployed ships, drones and divers with sea scooters to find out how accurately its software could pick out and identify the presence of these vehicles.",
      "And, the team tested whether their cable could \"hear\" a vessel plunging its anchor into the water.",
      "When pulses of light travel along a fibre optic strand, tiny reflections sometimes bounce back along that line. These reflections are affected by factors including temperature, vibrations or physical disturbance to the cable itself.",
      "Noticing a temperature change along part of a buried cable could reveal that part has become unburied, for example.",
      "AP Sensing shows me a video of a man walking across a lawn before lifting up a rifle and firing it during a test. A fibre optic cable buried in the ground a few metres away picked up the whole sequence.",
      "\"You see every single footstep,\" says Clemens Pohl, chief executive, as he points to a chart revealing disturbances in the fibre optic signal. The footsteps appear as brief blips or lines and the gunshot as a larger splodge.",
      "With this technology, it is even possible to work out the approximate size of a vessel passing above a subsea cable, as well as its location and, in some circumstances, its direction of travel. That could be correlated with satellite imagery, or even automatic identification system (AIS) records, which most ships broadcast at all times.",
      "It is possible to add monitoring capabilities to existing fibre optic cables if one unused, \"dark\" fibre is available, or a lit fibre with enough free channels, the firm adds.",
      "There are limitations, however. David Webb at Aston University says that fibre optic sensing technology cannot pick up disturbances from very far away, and you need to install signal listening devices, or interrogators, every 100km (62 miles) or so along a cable.",
      "AP Sensing says that it can pick up vibrations hundreds of metres away but \"usually not several kilometres away\". The company confirms that its technology is currently deployed on some cable installations in the North Sea, though declines to comment further.",
      "\"People really need an early warning in order to determine what to do,\" says Paul Heiden, chief executive of Optics11, a Dutch firm that also makes fibre optic acoustic sensing systems.",
      "Mr Heiden argues that cables installed solely for the purpose of monitoring marine activity could be especially useful \u2013 one might place such listening cables, say, 100km from a vital port, or in the vicinity of a key gas pipeline or telecommunications cable, rather than within those assets themselves.",
      "That could give operators an overview of vessel traffic in the area, and potentially advance notice of a ship heading towards a critical asset.",
      "Optics11's fibre optic listening technology can be deployed on military submarines, Mr Heiden adds, and he says the firm is soon to begin testing a monitoring cable installed somewhere on the floor of the Baltic Sea.",
      "Demand for fibre optic sensing technology is growing, says Douglas Clague at Viavi Solutions, a network testing and measurement company: \"We do see the number of requests increasing.\"",
      "Some of the cables damaged in recent incidents were made by Swedish cable company Hexatronic, says Christian Priess, head of Central Europe, Middle East, Africa and submarine cable business at the firm.",
      "Acoustic sensing is an emerging technology that Mr Priess suggests will become more common in the future. But there's relatively little one can do to protect a cable from sabotage, in terms of physical strengthening.",
      "Today's fibre optic cables already have metal casings folded and welded shut around the fibres, he says. There is also \"armoury wire\", thick metal cords, running along the outer parts of the cable and in some cases there are two layers of these cords. \"On the UK side of the Channel where you have a lot of rocks and a lot of fishing, you want to have it double-armoured,\" says Mr Priess.",
      "But should a vessel deliberately drag its heavy anchor across even a double-armoured cable, it will almost certainly still damage it, Mr Priess says \u2013 such is the force of the collision or pulling action.",
      "While it is possible to bury cables in the seabed for additional protection, this might become prohibitively expensive over long distances and at depths below a few dozen metres.",
      "\"Cables break all the time,\" says Lane Burdette, research analyst at TeleGeography, a telecoms market research firm. \"The number of cable faults per year has really held steady over the last several years,\" she adds, explaining that the 1-200 faults that typically occur annually has not risen despite ever more subsea cables being installed during that period.",
      "Ms Burdette also notes that, even when a cable is severed, telecommunications networks typically have significant redundancy built into them, meaning that end users often don't notice much disruption to their service.",
      "Still, the visible military response to cable breakages in the Baltic Sea is welcome, says Thorsten Benner, co-founder and director of the Global Public Policy Institute, a think tank: \"It's good that Nato and the European Union have woken up.\"",
      "And while cable sensing technology might be useful, its efficacy in terms of preventing damage rests on how quickly coastguard or military patrols could receive alerts about potential sabotage and react. \"The question is how quickly you could establish contact with a vessel,\" Says Benner.",

      "The Chinese government has promised new child care subsidies, increased wages and better paid leave to revive a slowing economy. That is on top of a $41bn discount programme for all sorts of things, from dishwashers and home decor to electric vehicles and smartwatches.",
      "Beijing is going on a spending spree that will encourage Chinese people to crack open their wallets.",
      "Simply put, they are not spending enough.",
      "Monday brought some positive news. Official data said retail sales grew 4% in the first two months of 2025, a positive sign for consumption data. But, with a few exceptions like Shanghai aside, new and existing home prices continued to decline compared to last year.",
      "While the US and other major powers have struggled with post-Covid inflation, China is experiencing the opposite: deflation - when the rate of inflation falls below zero, meaning that prices decrease. In China, prices fell for 18 months in a row in the past two years.",
      "Prices dropping might sound like good news for consumers. But a persistent decline in consumption - a measure of what households buy - signals deeper economic trouble. When people stop spending, businesses cut prices to attract buyers. The more this happens, the less money they make, hiring slows, wages stagnate and economic momentum grinds to a halt.",
      "That is a cycle China wants to avoid, given it's already battling sluggish growth in the wake of a prolonged crisis in the property market, steep government debt and unemployment.",
      "Three reasons Trump tariffs aren't China's only problem",
      "China says it is ready for 'any type of war' with US",
      "The cause of low consumption is straightforward: Chinese consumers either don't have enough money or don't feel confident enough about their future to spend it.",
      "But their reluctance comes at a critical moment. With the economy aiming to grow at 5% this year, boosting consumption is a top priority for President Xi Jinping. He is hoping that rising domestic consumption will absorb the blow US tariffs will inflict on Chinese exports.",
      "So, will Beijing's plan work?",
      "China is getting serious about spending",
      "To tackle its ailing economy and weak domestic demand, Beijing wrapped up its annual National People's Congress last week with increased investment in social welfare programmes as part of its grand economic plan for 2025.",
      "Then came this week's announcement with bigger promises, such as employment support plans, but scant details.",
      "Some say it is a welcome move, with the caveat that China's leaders need to do more to step up support. Still, it signals Beijing's awareness of the changes needed for a stronger Chinese consumer market - higher wages, a stronger social safety net and policies that make people feel secure enough to spend rather than save.",
      "A quarter of China's labour force is made up of low-paid migrant workers, who lack full access to urban social benefits. This makes them particularly vulnerable during periods of economic uncertainty, such as the Covid-19 pandemic.",
      "Rising wages during the 2010s masked some of these problems, with average incomes growing by around 10% annually. But as wage growth slowed in the 2020s, savings once again became a lifeline.",
      "The Chinese government, however, has been slow to expand social benefits, focusing instead on boosting consumption through short-term measures, such as trade-in programmes for household appliances and electronics. But that has not addressed a root problem, says Gerard DiPippo, a senior researcher at the Rand think tank: \"Household incomes are lower, and savings are higher\".",
      "The near-collapse of the property market has also made Chinese consumers more risk-averse, leading them to cut back on spending.",
      "\"The property market matters not only for real economic activity but also for household sentiment, since Chinese households have invested so much of their wealth in their homes,\" Mr DiPippo says. \"I don't think China's consumption will fully recover until it's clear that the property sector has bottomed out and therefore many households' primary assets are starting to recover.\"",
      "Some analysts are encouraged by Beijing's seriousness in targeting longer-term challenges like falling birth rates as more young couples opt out of the costs of parenthood.",
      "A 2024 study by Chinese think tank YuWa estimated that raising a child to adulthood in China costs 6.8 times the country's GDP per capita - among the highest in the world, compared to the US (4.1), Japan (4.3) and Germany (3.6).",
      "These financial pressures have only reinforced a deeply ingrained saving culture. Even in a struggling economy, Chinese households managed to save 32% of their disposable income in 2024.",
      "That's not too surprising in China, where consumption has never been particularly high. To put this in perspective, domestic consumption drives more than 80% of growth in the US and UK, and about 70% in India. China's share has typically ranged between 50% to 55% over the past decade.",
      "But this wasn't really a problem - until now.",

      "But the last one \"was a dud,\" a Beijing-based coffee bean online seller told the BBC.  \"If anything, it caused more trouble than it was worth.\"",
      "Chinese consumers have grown frugal since the pandemic, and this caution has persisted even after restrictions were lifted in late 2022.",
      "That's the year Alibaba and JD.com stopped publishing their sales figures, a significant shift for companies that once headlined their record-breaking revenues. A source familiar with the matter told the BBC that Chinese authorities cautioned platforms against releasing numbers, fearing that underwhelming results could further dent consumer confidence.",
      "The spending crunch has even hit high-end brands - last year, LVMH, Burberry and Richemont all reported sales declines in China, once a backbone of the global luxury market.",
      "On RedNote, a Chinese social media app, posts tagged with \"consumption downgrade\" have racked up more than a billion views in recent months. Users are swapping tips on how to replace expensive purchases with budget-friendly alternatives. \"Tiger Balm is the new coffee,\" said one user, while another quipped, \"I apply perfume between my nose and lips now \u2013 saving it just for myself.\"",
      "Even at its peak, China's consumer boom was never a match for its exports. Trade  was also the focus of generous state-backed investment in highways, ports and special economic zones. China relied on low-wage workers and high household savings, which fuelled growth but left consumers with limited disposable income.",
      "But now, as geopolitical uncertainties grow, countries are diversifying supply chains away from China, reducing reliance on Chinese exports. Local governments are burdened by debt, after years of borrowing heavily to invest, particularly in infrastructure.",
      "Xi Jinping has already vowed \"to make domestic demand the main driving force and stabilising anchor of growth\". Caiyun Wang, a National People's Congress representative, said, \"With a population of 1.4 billion, even a 1% rise in demand creates a market of 14 million people.\"",
      "But there's a catch in Beijing's plan.",
      "For consumption to drive growth, many analysts say, the Chinese Communist Party would have to restore the consumer confidence of a generation of Covid graduates that is struggling to own a home or find a job. It would also require triggering a cultural shift, from saving to spending.",
      "\"China's extraordinarily low consumption level is not an accident,\" according to Michael Pettis, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. \"It is fundamental to the country's economic growth model, around which three-four decades of political, financial, legal and business institutions in China have evolved. Changing this won't be easy.\"",
      "The more households spend, the less there is in the pool of savings that China's state-controlled banks rely on to fund key industries - currently that includes AI and innovative tech that would give Beijing an edge over Washington, both economically and strategically.",
      "That is why some analysts doubt that China's leaders want to create a consumer-driven economy.",
      "\"One way to think about this is that Beijing's primary goal is not to enhance the welfare of Chinese households, but rather the welfare of the Chinese nation,\" David Lubin, a research fellow at Chatham House wrote.",
      "Shifting power from the state to the individual may not be what Beijing wants.",
      "China's leaders did do that in the past, when they began trading with the world, encouraging businesses and inviting foreign investment. And it transformed their economy. But the question is whether Xi Jinping wants to do that again.",

    "story": [
      "About 6,000 community pharmacies in England are being advised to start working to rule in two weeks, unless an agreement can be reached with the government on a new NHS contract.",
      "The National Pharmacy Association (NPA) is urging its members to take action because they have yet to receive any confirmation of an increase in funding for this or next financial year.",
      "Action could involve reducing their opening hours and cutting other services, such as delivering medicines to people's homes.",
      "The government said the move would cause \"unnecessary disruption for patients\" and a settlement with pharmacies was already being worked on.",
      "Causing anxiety",
      "A pharmacy's NHS contract accounts for about 90% of its revenue, on average.",
      "And with increases in National Insurance, the National Living Wage and business rates, from 1 April, pharmacies say the lack of agreement over their contract is causing worry and uncertainty.",
      "This comes on top of a decade of cuts to funding, which has seen 30 pharmacies close since the start of this year, the NPA says.",
      "Some 3,000 pharmacy owners in England, Wales and Northern Ireland voted in favour of action, in November.",
      "This could involve cutting pharmacy opening times to 40 hours a week, which is the minimum set out in the current NHS contract, with shops less likely to be open at weekends and in the evenings.",
      "Pharmacies may also decide to stop offering other services not in their current contract, such as stop smoking and addiction support, and emergency contraception.",
      "Hundreds of pharmacies could close - trade body",
      "'I can't keep running my pharmacy from my savings'",
      "Demoralised pharmacists face uncertain future",
      "Nick Kaye, who chairs the NPA, said pharmacies had been \"left with little choice\".",
      "\"It is better that we temporarily reduce access in the short term than to let pharmacies collapse altogether under the weight of unsustainable operating costs,\" he said.",
      "There had been little feedback from ministers and the impact of the current uncertainty was \"devastating\" for pharmacies, Mr Kaye added.",
      "\"We want to get on with seeing patients, pay our staff, not have to think about closing, and invest in our business for the future.\"",
      "'Unnecessary disruption'",
      "The Department of Health and Social Care said pharmacies had a vital role to play as the NHS's focus shifted away from hospitals and into the community - and negotiations over a contract were making progress.",
      "\"The National Pharmacy Association's pre-emptive action will cause unnecessary disruption for patients and we urge them to reconsider,\" an official said.",
      "Healthwatch England, which records the experiences and concerns of people who use health and social-care services, urged the government to conclude negotiations with pharmacies as soon as possible.",
      "Benedict Knox, from Healthwatch England, said many patients had seen their local pharmacy close or experience disruptions due to staff shortages.",
      "\"This issue especially impacts older people and is particularly acute in rural areas, where people often have to travel further to visit their pharmacist,\" he said.",
      "But he stressed not every community pharmacy was an NPA member and it was up to each one to decide if they would reduce services.",
      "There are about 10,500 pharmacies in England, according to Community Pharmacy England, which represents all pharmacy owners."

    "summary": "German MPs could pave the way for huge investments to defend Europe against a threatening Russia.",
    "story": [
      "What happens today, here in Berlin, will impact the entire future of Europe's defence and its ongoing support for Ukraine.",
      "Germany's Parliament, the Bundestag, is voting on whether to take the brakes off defence spending. This could pave the way for a massive uplift in military investment just as Russia makes gains in Ukraine and Washington signals that Europe can no longer rely on US protection.",
      "\"This vote in the Bundestag is absolutely crucial,\" says Prof Monika Schnitzer, who chairs Germany's Council of Economic Experts.",
      "\"After the Munich Security Conference, then the Trump-Zelensky row, Europe got a wake-up call. For the first time Europeans may not be able to rely on Washington. A lot of people had sleepless nights after that.\"",
      "\"The outlook for European defence spending hinges on developments in Germany, as the holder of the region's largest defence budget,\" agrees Dr Fenella McGerty, senior fellow for defence economics at the London-based International Institute for Strategic Studies.",
      "Defence spending in Germany rose by 23.2% last year, helping to drive a record 11.7% rise in European defence outlay.",
      "\"The remarkable initiatives announced in Germany are key to enabling further growth,\" adds Dr McGerty.",
      "\"Without them, any progress made on strengthening Germany's military capability may have stalled.\"",
      "Germany's incoming new Chancellor, Friedrich Merz, is in a race against time.",
      "The new parliament convenes on 25 March and not everyone is in favour of all this money being spent, especially on defence.",
      "Both the far-right AfD party and the far-left Linke have vowed to oppose it. The vote needs two-thirds in favour to go through, so Merz has a better chance of this happening today, under the existing (old) parliament. It then needs to be approved by Germany's upper house.",
      "Meanwhile Europe is still coming to terms with the shock of announcements coming from the Trump administration.",
      "At last month's Munich Security Conference I watched as delegates sat open-mouthed listening to US Vice-President JD Vance's blistering attack on Europe's policies on migration and free speech.",
      "This was preceded days earlier by US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth telling Nato members that America's 80-year-long defensive umbrella for Europe should no longer be taken for granted.",
      "Defence strategists in Europe are already planning for the unthinkable: a semi-victorious Russia making gains in Ukraine, then rebuilding its army and threatening Nato's eastern members, such as the Baltic states, within three years or less.",
      "This, at a time when the US commitment to Europe's defence is looking extremely shaky. President Trump is being urged by some in his circle to pull US troops out of Europe and even to withdraw from Nato altogether.",
      "Historical caution",
      "There is talk of France extending its national nuclear deterrent to cover other European nations.",
      "Meanwhile, most European governments are under pressure to raise defence spending after years of cuts.",
      "The British Army has now shrunk to its smallest size since the Napoleonic Wars, over 200 years ago, and experts predict it would run out of ammunition within two weeks of fighting a full-scale conventional war in Europe.",
      "Germany has long been cautious about defence spending, not just for historical reasons dating back to 1945, but also due to the global debt crisis of 2009.",
      "Which brings us back to today's crucial vote in the Bundestag. It is not just about defence. One part is about freeing up \u20ac500bn (\u00a3420bn) for German infrastructure \u2013 fixing things like bridges and roads, but also to pay for climate change measures, something the Green Party insisted on.",
      "The other part is about removing the restrictions in the constitution on borrowing that could, in theory, free up unlimited billions of euros for defence spending, both for Germany's armed forces and for a pan-European defence fund. On 4 March European Commission President Ursula Von der Leyen announced plans for an \u20ac800bn defence fund called The ReArm Europe Fund.",
      "The proposal being voted on in Berlin is that any spending on defence that amounts to more than 1% of Germany's GDP (national wealth) would no longer be subject to a limit on borrowing. Until now this debt ceiling has been fixed at 0.35 pct of GDP.",
      "Other countries will be watching closely to see if this proposal passes. If it does not, then the EU Commission's 'ReArm Europe' project could be off to a shaky start.",
      "The challenge today for Europe's security is a stark one. If the US no longer has its back, or at the very least cannot be relied upon to come to Europe's defence, then what does the continent need to do to fill the gap?",
      "Let's start with the numbers. According to the Kiel Institute, which meticulously tracks these things, Europe spends just 0.1% of its wealth on helping to defend Ukraine, while the US has been spending 0.15%.",
      "\"That means,\" says the Kiel Institute's Giuseppe Irto, \"that if Europe is to make up the shortfall then it needs to double its contribution to 0.21%.\"",
      "But regardless of what happens today in Berlin this is not just about money.",
      "Many of the most sought-after weapons in Ukraine's armoury have come from the US, like Patriot air defence and long-range artillery systems like Himars. The Kiel Institute puts the proportion of Ukraine's rocket artillery at 86% coming from the US, with 82% of its howitzer ammunition also being US-sourced.",
      "Then there is the whole question of US intelligence aid for Kyiv, much of it derived from satellites and geospatial imagery. If Washington were to permanently switch that off, then Ukrainian forces risk being partially blinded.",
      "If America's nuclear arsenal is taken out of the equation then there is a massive disparity between Russia's 5,000-plus warheads and the combined total of Britain and France's nukes which amount to less than a tenth of that. But that still theoretically leaves enough to act as a nuclear deterrent.",
      "Culture shift",
      "When it comes to \"conventional\", ie. non-nuclear arms, Western defence chiefs are fond of saying that Nato's combined forces are superior to Russia's.",
      "Maybe, but if there is one glaring lesson to come out of the Ukraine war it is that \"mass\" matters. Russia's army may be of poor quality but President Putin has been able to throw such huge numbers of men, drones, shells and missiles at Ukraine's front lines that the Russians are inexorably advancing, albeit slowly and at huge cost.",
      "This should not come as a surprise. Moscow put its economy on to a war footing some time ago. It appointed an economist as its defence minister and retooled many of its factories to churn out vast quantities of munitions, especially explosive-tipped drones.",
      "While many European nations have dragged their feet over raising defence spending much above the Nato-mandated 2% of GDP, Russia's is closer to 7%. Around 40% of Russia's national budget is spent on defence.",
      "So Europe has a fair bit of catching up to do if it is to even come close to shoring up its defence and security.",
      "\"If the vote passes then it will be significant for Germany and for Europe,\" says Ed Arnold, senior research fellow for European security at the Royal United Services Institute think tank.",
      "\"It will set a precedent and allow others to follow... However, three years on from the invasion of Ukraine the case of Germany is a reminder that more money for defence is necessary but not sufficient.",
      "\"Europe needs defence and security leaders who are able to navigate a rapidly deteriorating Euro-Atlantic security environment. Cultural, rather than financial reform, would be most valuable to Europe right now.\"",

    "summary": "The debate has sparked a wider dilemma about the broader purpose of welfare",
    "story": [
      "In the next 24 hours and then over the following fortnight up until the Spring Statement, the government is going to talk a lot about a broken welfare system that is failing the people who use it, the economy and taxpayers.",
      "Taking a tough call on fixing it goes against the instincts of much of the Labour Party and has already sparked an internal backlash that could rise to ministerial level, as well as protests.",
      "The government is making two key related judgements. The first is that the country cannot afford to sustain recent ballooning increases in the health-related benefit bill and caseload, in particular for mental illness.",
      "At the same time, it will argue that a job is the best medicine.",
      "Underlying this is an assumption that a health-related benefits system that was built-up to deal with industrial injuries can't apply to the post-pandemic service economy workforce.",
      "The net result is likely to be significant changes to Personal Independence Payments, aiming to reduce eligibility for the highest levels of payments, especially among those of working age with mental illness.",
      "In addition, there will be a levelling of the generosity of the health component of Universal Credit. This will save billions of pounds, and about a billion of that will be reinvested in trying to help get those capable of part-time work some help for a partial return.",
      "Mapping welfare trends",
      "The Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) is rolling in real-time data. \"Cluster analysis maps\" reveal to ministers exactly who is claiming out of work benefits and where they are.",
      "As the numbers continue to increase, the data is being cut by sector, postcode, age and type of illness. Every pattern is being analysed.",
      "The idea was that the data would firstly offer the government insight into how it could make billions of pounds of cuts to a rapidly growing bill in order to help the Chancellor meet her self-imposed government borrowing rules.",
      "Secondly, it was meant to point to more fundamental reforms to welfare, also designed to temper the same ballooning rise in the costs of dealing with ill health among the working population.",
      "The data has thrown up answers.",
      "That poor mental health is driving the rise in claimants is clear. To a lesser extent, so too is the role that raising the state pension age has played, with many thousands who would previously have been retired now claiming health-related benefits.",
      "But it has also thrown up a major question too: does cutting welfare to incentivise people to work more hours in fact do the opposite - nudging them out of the workforce altogether and ultimately increasing the benefit bill?",
      "If this is the case - and it is by no means a universally accepted interpretation of what has happened - then the question is whether further cuts could in fact increase the numbers claiming? And should Labour instead invest in getting people back into work?",
      "Growing sickness",
      "When I visited a job centre in Birmingham alongside the Work and Pensions Secretary Liz Kendall in the Autumn, I was taken aback by how the work coaches were talking as much about health as about work.",
      "\"There's a lot of mental health, depression and anxiety,\" Qam told me.",
      "GPs have reported that their surgery time is dominated by trying to work out whether their patients are \"fit for work\". Roughly 11 million fit notes are issued every year in England alone, with 93% assessing the patient as \"not fit for work\". That has doubled over a decade. In the latest quarter, 44% were for 5 weeks or more absence.",
      "From that pool of growing in-work sickness, a significant proportion ends up on some form of incapacity benefits. The Treasury's bill for health and disability benefits, which was \u00a328bn in the year before the pandemic, is now \u00a352bn a year. It is forecast by the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) to hit \u00a370bn by the end of the decade.",
      "The pure financial aim here is to \"bend the curve\" down to nearer \u00a360bn in that period. This means restricting both the generosity and eligibility of some - or all of such - payments. It could require a wholesale cash freeze so that benefits do not rise with inflation, for example, or the abolition of entire categories of recipients.",
      "'Deaths of despair'",
      "An Institute for Fiscal Studies report published last week showed that wider measures of mental ill health have rocketed since the pandemic. Between 2002 and 2024, the number of 16-64-year-olds claiming disability benefits for mental or behavioural health conditions increased from 360,000 to 1.28 million.",
      "Every day in 2023 there were 10 extra \"deaths of despair\" (defined as deaths from alcohol, drugs or suicide) in England and Wales than the average between 2015 and 2019. Average sickness absence rates across the whole economy remained structurally higher than pre-pandemic.",
      "Of particular concern is how this affects young people. In a recent report DWP adviser Prof Paul Gregg points to the \"incredibly low\" chances of sustained returns to the workforce once a person has been on incapacity benefits for two years.",
      "About two fifths of new incapacity benefit claimants under 25 came directly from education. The latest DWP analysis shows these trends are now closely related to broader socio-economic vulnerabilities such as limited education and also with precarious sectors such as retail and hospitality.",
      "The question that remains is whether so many people really are more sick - and what role (if any) is played by the reduction in stigma around mental health.",
      "But then there is the question of how to address it.",
      "Overly binary",
      "Another major factor is that rise in the state pension age, which the DWP calculates, resulted in 89,000 older workers instead claiming health-related benefits. However, the sharp increase in claimants of such benefits since the pandemic is not only attributable to ageing populations or increasing mental health diagnoses.",
      "Research suggests there are significant systemic and policy-driven causes. At its heart the problem is perceived to be that the current welfare structure has become overly binary, failing to accommodate a growing demographic who should be able to do at least a bit of work.",
      "This rigidity - what ministers refer to as a \"hard boundary\" - inadvertently pushes individuals towards declaring complete unfitness for work, and can lead to total dependence on welfare, particularly Universal Credit Health (UC Health), rather than facilitating a gradual transition back into employment.",
      "This has been bad for the economy, for employers, terrible for the public finances, and deeply concerning for the career prospects of individuals.",
      "History helps here. Health-related benefits are often a disguised form of unemployment. The caseload for incapacity benefits (which include not just UC Health but previous incarnations) since the 1970s shows the UK heading for a record of one in 12 adults of working age in receipt.",
      "But this is not the first such build-up. It happened in the late 1980s when Margaret Thatcher was prime minister, and it was reversed in the early 2000s under New Labour.",
      "The launch in 1986 of Restart Programme, a forerunner to JobSeekers Allowance modelled on Ronald Reagan's policies in the US, helped return many claimants to the workforce but also pushed a staggering number into incapacity claims.",
      "Over the decade and a half of this policy, there was a 1.6 million increase in people in receipt of the benefit. But at the time this migration from claimant unemployment into incapacity was apparently a deliberate strategy, as it helped deal with headlines about \"three million unemployed\".",
      "A middle ground",
      "The government has not yet published its analysis on the jobs market, but Prof Gregg's early thinking was made clear in a report for the Health Foundation. He argued that, historically, the welfare system responded effectively through a middle ground that allowed individuals to combine part-time work with partial welfare benefits. He puts this down to reforms introduced in the early 2000s, such as tax credits.",
      "This is essentially the crystallisation of Iain Duncan Smith's critique of then chancellor George Osborne's welfare cuts of 2016. He told me at the time that they were \"deeply unfair\" on working people and the vision of a proper welfare-to-work scheme \"could not be repeatedly salami-sliced\".",
      "Some argue that those reforms created a situation where individuals, unable to sustain full-time work, gravitate towards more generous health-based welfare program.",
      "Crucially, claims began to rise in 2018. At the DWP ministers have tried to research the reasons behind the increase in caseload - and found that about a third of the increase can be explained as the predictable consequence of policy or of demographics.",
      "Prevention rather than cure",
      "With an ongoing flow of new claimants arriving in the system (nearly half a million in the last financial year) the onus is now on finding a prevention rather than a cure.",
      "And this is where it becomes tricky - one suggestion involves eliminating the current welfare trap by reintroducing intermediate support for part-time work. However, that requires extra funding, as well as a way of providing more personalised job searches and better mental health support.",
      "Another option is passing responsibilities to employers. In the Netherlands, employers bear significant responsibilities and financial costs if they fail to adequately support employees facing health challenges. In the early 2000s, the Dutch also had very high levels of incapacity but they now report employment rates of 83%.",
      "The structure of the jobs market in the UK makes that challenging to replicate - for example there are more insecure zero hours contracts.",
      "And given that businesses feel under pressure from National Insurance rises and a slow economy, could they really be cajoled into helping?",
      "Faster cuts",
      "The questions arising from the data will matter for the economy, for the public finances, our health, and young people's careers and livelihoods, at a time of considerable change.",
      "Fundamentally, it is a question of what the benefit system is for, at a time when illness is being redefined, and when the trends are, frankly, scary.",
      "Then there is the question of whether the public wants to pay even higher taxes in the hope of delivering long-term gain. Welfare-to-work programs can pay for themselves eventually, but the Government feels it needs to book faster cuts.",
      "That's because all of this is in the context of what \"fiscal headroom\" the government did have against the Chancellor's self-imposed borrowing targets being wiped out since the Trump shock to the world economy, the Budget and the announcements of extra European defence spending.",
      "But government insiders are at pains to argue that the primary motivation for any cuts is not regaining the extra room for manoeuvre. \"We don't need the OBR to tell us that we need to fix welfare to get people back to work. We don't need the OBR to tell us we need to make the NHS more productive. And we don't need the OBR to tell us that the taxpayer should be getting more value for money,\" a source told me.",

    "story": [
      "The chancellor has told regulators there is \"too much bureaucracy\" as she aims to slash red tape to boost economic growth.",
      "Rachel Reeves met industry watchdogs on Monday, revealing plans to cut the cost of regulation, including on environmental measures, and axe some bodies entirely.",
      "It comes as a leading think tank cut its UK growth forecasts for 2025 and 2026 as it downgraded prospects for the global economy over trade war concerns.",
      "The government has made boosting growth its main priority, but the Conservatives said Labour's taxes were harming growth and called on Reeves to set out a \"real plan\".",
      "Reeves told regulators at the 40-minute meeting that the current level of bureaucracy made it \"too slow to get things done\".",
      "\"There are a number of things over the last decade or so that have held back growth, and one of them - if we are honest and you know better than anyone - is the regulatory landscape,\" she said.",
      "Reeves also spoke about reducing the duplication of work done by regulators.",
      "'Global headwinds'",
      "In its latest forecast, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development's (OECD) cut its predictions for UK growth to 1.4% in 2025, from its previous forecast of 1.7%, and to 1.2% in 2026, down from 1.3%.",
      "However, the forecast is more optimistic than the Bank of England, which earlier this month cut its UK growth forecast for 2025 to 0.75%.",
      "Economic forecasts are not always accurate but predictions from the OECD are looked at closely.",
      "The OECD said that for the world economy, growth would slow from 3.2% in 2024 to 3.1% in 2025, largely as a result of the trade tensions sparked by US President Donald Trump's introduction of tariffs on imports into the US.",
      "In response to the OECD's forecast, Reeves said: \"This report shows the world is changing, and increased global headwinds such as trade uncertainty are being felt across the board.\"",
      "The UK economy shrank unexpectedly in January, contracting by 0.1%, which was weaker than forecast, driven mainly by a decline in the manufacturing sector.",
      "Ahead of Monday's meeting with regulators, Reeves said. \"By cutting red tape and creating a more effective system, we will boost investment, create jobs and put more money into working people's pockets.\"",
      "Changes announced by the government include streamlining the environmental regulatory process for major projects including Lower Thames Crossing (subject to planning approval) and future ones such as a Heathrow expansion.",
      "Meanwhile, environmental guidance, including hundreds of pages on protection of bats, will be reviewed, while environmental permits for some low-risk and temporary projects will be removed.",
      "This plan comes alongside 60 measures agreed upon by watchdogs \"following weeks of intense negotiations\" that are designed to make it easier to do business in the UK.",
      "Those measures include:",
      "Fast-tracking new medicines through a pilot to provide parallel authorisations from healthcare regulatorsReviewing the \u00a3100 cap on individual contactless paymentsSimplifying mortgage lending rules to make it easier to re-mortgage with a new lender and reduce mortgage termsSetting up a 'concierge service' to help international financial services firms navigate regulationsCivil Aviation Authority permitting at least two more large drone-flying trials for deliveries in the coming months - which the government said has already cut travel times for blood samples between hospitals from 30 minutes down to two minutes",

      "The government has already announced plans to fold another quango, the Payments Systems Regulator, into the Financial Conduct Authority.",

      "The chancellor has promised to significantly cut the number of regulators by the end of the Parliament.",

      "\"Rachel Reeves has nine days until her emergency budget, where the Conservatives are calling on her to set out a real plan for\u00a0growth,\" Stride said.",
      "Mark Allan, chief executive of commercial property firm Landsec, said: \"We have been through a period over many years of having regulation laid on top of existing regulation.\"",

    "summary": "Despite dire predictions of climate breakdown, more Sports Utility Vehicles are being spotted on, and off, the roads.",
    "story": [
      "Across the globe more and more Sports Utility Vehicles (SUVs) are being spotted on \u2013 and off \u2013 the roads.",
      "This is despite predictions from the United Nations of an inevitable pivot towards smaller and more environmentally friendly vehicles because of the urgency of the climate crisis and the rising cost of living.",
      "That pivot has not materialised: globally, 54% of the cars sold in 2024 were SUVs, including petrol, diesel, hybrids and electric makes. This is an increase of three percentage points from 2023 and five percentage points from the year before, according to GlobalData.",
      "Of the SUVs which are now on the road \u2013 both new and older models \u2013 95% are burning fossil fuels, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA).",
      "Manufacturers, however, say their new fleets of such cars are increasingly becoming electric, and that not all SUVs now being sold cause an increase in emissions.",
      "SUVs are hard to miss. They are heavy and larger with spacious interiors, higher ground clearance and a high driving position with a better view of the road, although smaller versions are also on the market.",
      "Environmental campaigners such as Greenpeace see SUVs as one of the villains of the climate crisis and argue that their manufacturing consumes significant resources given their size.",
      "Experts also say they require larger batteries to power their electric versions, which then further increases the demand for critical minerals, putting even more pressure on the planet.",
      "Momentum was thought to be with smaller, energy-efficient electric vehicles. But the sales of standard-sized electric vehicles (EVs) has actually decreased in major markets such as Japan and Germany, and their sales growth has slowed in India.",
      "And in Europe, sales of SUVs have outpaced those of EVs despite indications more than half a decade ago of an opposite trend. In Europe in 2018, 3.27 million small hatchbacks \u2013 both those powered by fossil fuels and those by electricity \u2013 were sold while 2.13 million were sold in 2024, according to GlobalData.",
      "Its sales forecast manager Sammy Chan said: \"This is partly because of the SUV alternatives being offered in smaller [sizes] whose sales in Europe have now grown to nearly to 2.5 million in 2024 from 1.5 million in 2018.\"",
      "China saw the largest sales of nearly 11.6 million SUVs in 2024 followed by the US, India and Germany, according to GlobalData.",
      "What is driving this SUV growth?",
      "Industry experts say people's purchasing power has been improving in many fast-emerging economies, making SUVs the likelier choice of car.",
      "\"Manufacturers respond to consumer demand and, increasingly, drivers are attracted to dual purpose vehicles given their practicality, comfort and good view of the road,\" said Mike Hawes who is the chief executive of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT).",
      "Automobile industry analysts also say that manufacturers are attracted to high profit margins from SUVs: they can make more money from SUVs even though they make fewer vehicles.",
      "\"It is the industry that has driven the demand through huge marketing and advertising campaigns in recent years,\" said Dudley Curtis, the communications manager at the European Transport Safety Council.",
      "\"SUVs offered the industry a simple way of charging more for a vehicle that does the same thing [as others],\" he said.",
      "Are SUVs an issue?",
      "Because of the robust growth in SUVs sales, the IEA says oil consumption of these  vehicles has increased by 600,000 barrels per day globally between 2022 and 2023, accounting for more than a quarter of the total annual rise in global oil demand.",
      "\"If ranked among countries, the global fleet of SUVs would be the world's fifth largest emitter of CO2, exceeding the emissions of Japan and various other major economies,\" said Apostolous Petropolous, an energy modeller with the IEA.",
      "The agency says that even when compared to medium-sized cars that run on petrol and diesel, SUVs burn 20% more of such fuels as they weigh up to 300 kg more on average.",
      "In fact, road transport is responsible for more than 12% of global carbon emissions which is the main driver of global warming. Scientists say all sectors must rapidly decarbonise if we are to avoid a climate catastrophe.",
      "But industry representatives say in response that not all SUVs now being sold cause an increase in emissions.",
      "BMW delays electric Mini over 'uncertainty'",
      "Why don't Europeans buy more American cars?",
      "\"Around two in five of these [new] vehicle models are zero emission as their body type lends itself well to electrification with longer battery range that can reassure consumers concerned about charging accessibility,\" said Hawes, from the SMMT.",
      "\"This has led to the average CO2 emissions of new dual purpose cars more than halving since 2000, helping the segment lead the decarbonisation of UK road mobility.\"",
      "Although the vast majority of new SUVs still burn fossil fuels, IEA officials have said that over 20% of SUVs sold in 2023 were fully electric, up from 2% in 2018.",
      "As for hybrids that can run on both electricity and fossil fuels, a study in Europe by the International Council on Clean Transportation in 2022 found only around 30% of the total distance driven by plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (all types including SUVs) was in electric mode on average.",
      "Similar results were found in other major economies such as the US and China.",
      "Overall, the back-gear towards SUVs, some experts say, has caused a significant setback in the decarbonisation of the transport sector.",
      "\"The trend toward heavier and less efficient vehicles such as SUVs (in countries where it is happening) has largely nullified the improvements in energy consumption and emissions achieved elsewhere in the world's passenger car fleet,\" said the IEA.",

      "Stewart Kenny, who helped found the Irish company in the 80s, believes online slot games spin too fast, which contributes to them being addictive.",
      "He thinks new government rules limiting the stakes are not enough to render them safe, and thinks the games should also be slowed down.",
      "From April, slots will be limited to \u00a35 per spin for over 25s. In May, 18-24-year-olds will be limited to \u00a32 per spin.",
      "This follows a government review of the 2005 Gambling Act, and the publication of a white paper which introduces new measures to strengthen gambling harm legislation.",
      "Online slots are web versions of slot machines you see in a casino. The punter enters money and spins a wheel. If the symbols or pictures match, they could win money.",
      "The government said it was bringing in stake limits for them because they are \"a higher-risk gambling product associated with large losses, long sessions, and binge play\".",
      "But in a new documentary series on Radio 4, Stewart Kenny, who resigned from the board of the betting company in 2016, says the speed of the games is what makes them addictive.",
      "He says the gap between investment and results being \"only seconds\" means punters can \"repeat the dose\" at high speed.",
      "In addition to this, he says the machines provide \"plenty of noise and plenty of colours\", as well as near misses, which are \"fundamental to gambling addiction\".",
      "The Department for Culture Media and Sport said the Gambling Commission introduced requirements that changed speed and intensity of slots in 2021: \"This included a minimum speed of 2.5 seconds per spin, a ban on autoplay and features that increase play intensity, such as turbo, quick spin and slam stop, or give the illusion of 'false wins'.\"",
      "Gambling companies make a significant proportion of their profits from online slots. Acording to market data collected by the Gambling Commission up to December 2024, the profits from slots increased 15% year on year to a new high of \u00a3709m. The number of spins increased 9% in the previous quarter to a new peak of \u00a323.9bn.",

      "Stewart Kenny resigned from the board of Flutter, saying he felt the company was not doing enough to protect vulnerable customers using its websites.",
      "Mr Kenny no longer has any financial interest with the company, and receives no payment for taking part in the programmes.",
      "In the documentary series Changing the Odds, Mr Kenny teams up with journalist Lydia Thomas, who has reported on the betting industry for a decade, to chart 20 years since the 2005 Gambling Act. The act paved the way for the UK betting industry to revolutionise gambling and take it online.",
      "For many years, the UK has been the biggest online betting market in the world \u2013 with the industry worth \u00a315.6bn. Only recently has the United States overtaken as more states allow online gambling.",
      "And it is the move online that sparked Mr Kenny's worries when he was sitting on the board. He believes the internet by its very nature can be addictive and that adding online casinos in the mix has \"made the cocktail too strong\".",
      "Mr Kenny still enjoys gambling, and regularly bets on horse and dog racing, which he believes is a less addictive gambling product. But he criticises the industry for encouraging sports betting punters to move to online slots.",
      "\"I have always said I have been very relaxed about my kids opening up betting accounts. But, I would be horrified if my grandchildren open up a betting account.",
      "\"What the bookmakers do is, when you open a betting account at the age of 18 to have a bet, and you're a kid and you want to have a fiver on your local team, within 48 hours, the bookmakers will try and suck you into the highly addictive online casino by sending you free spins.\"",
      "Mr Kenny believes it is up to the government and regulators to make gambling safe.",
      "\"There's a balance here. If you want to bet, you should be allowed to bet. It's a free society. So you don't want to interfere with people's entertainment too much.  It's so easy to blame the betting companies. This is a matter for legislators.\"",
      "Flutter Entertainment said it recognised that the gambling industry had not always got things right in the past but said its UK business had \"evolved significantly in the years since Stewart's involvement, which ended over eight years ago\".",
      "It said in that time, it had been \"a vocal and constructive supporter\" of the Gambling Act Review and the white paper, while \"leading the industry on proactive change\" with its introduction of deposit limits for under-25s and the setting of a \u00a310 stake limit on online slot products.",

      "But the project missed out on the first round of UK government support and campaigners want a clear signal that it will be given full backing by ministers.",
      "One thing that is definitely going to be created at Grangemouth is a new import terminal to replace the closing refinery.",
      "That would mean the procession of tankers which deliver aviation fuel to Edinburgh Airport can be maintained.",
      "In the longer-term, a facility creating sustainable aviation fuel could use some of the skills of the existing workforce.",
      "It is on the political agenda.",
      "Since January, the UK government has mandated that 2% of UK jet fuel has to come from renewable sources - which means alternatives to fossil fuels. This will increase to 10% by the end of the decade.",
      "But there's been no commitment that Grangemouth will be the source of some of that fuel.",
      "The other potential options include a \"biorefinery\" which could use waste whisky and food in chemical production processes to reduce reliance on fossil fuels.",
      "Advanced recycling methods could also be developed which would produce high quality plastics able to be used in food packaging and health care.",
      "That would involve a process called \"cracking\" which breaks down the products into smaller molecules.",
      "It's a technique which is already carried out on fossil-fuel based chemicals at the Ineos site.",
      "Hydrogen will also play an increasingly important role in our economy over the coming decades as a clean energy, particularly in heavy transport and industry.",
      "Scotland's abundance of wind means generating green hydrogen from electricity has huge potential.",
      "Some hydrogen is already made at Grangemouth, and plans have previously been announced to significantly increase production by 2030.",
      "That hydrogen would then be used to displace gas to generate high temperatures in industrial processes.",
      "Grangemouth, however, does not currently have the right conditions to store hydrogen in significant quantities.",
      "Large underground salt caverns are ideal - but the nearest potential sites are in East Yorkshire and Cheshire.",
      "So either expensive storage units would have to be built above ground near Grangemouth, or the hydrogen would have to be piped hundreds of miles.",
      "The Project Willow report, when it's released, is expected to put figures to some of these propositions.",
      "It will cover the likely costs, the potential jobs and the value to the Scottish and UK economies.",
      "That will not be the end of the matter; in fact, it's barely the beginning.",
      "Attracting the public and private investment will be far more challenging than outlining the options.",
      "But talking about it early - and in a co-ordinated way - will surely maximise the chances of securing a long-term future for a site so intrinsically linked with fossil fuels."

      "In July 2023, we published our initial investigation, which reported claims by workers, some as young as 17, of being groped and harassed almost routinely.",
      "At the time, McDonald's apologised and set up a new unit to deal with complaints.",

      "The price of gold has hit the $3,000 per ounce mark for the first time as demand for the precious metal surges amid economic uncertainty over the impact of a global trade war.",
      "Gold touched a record $3,004.86 per ounce on Friday, with prices having risen by 14% since the start of 2025.",
      "Gold is seen as a safer asset for investors and is often sought after in times of economic instability.",
      "The escalating trade war between the US and many of its largest trading partners has unsettled financial markets and raised concerns about the impact on economies and consumers across the world.",
      "The introduction of tariffs, which are taxes charged on businesses importing goods from overseas, has fuelled fears of price inflation, which has driven investors to gold.",
      "When tariffs are imposed on goods, businesses face extra costs, which could be passed on through the price tags of the products sold to consumers - increasing the cost of living.",
      "On Thursday, US President Donald Trump threatened a 200% tariff on any alcohol coming to the US from the European Union (EU) in the latest twist of the trade war.",
      "The announcement was in response to the EU's plans for a 50% tax on imports of US-produced whiskey as part of the bloc's first retaliation to Trump's blanket tariffs on all steel and aluminium imports to the US from any country.",
      "The US president has also raised levies on Chinese imports into the US to at least 20%.",
      "Trump threatens 200% tariff on alcohol from EU",
      "What are tariffs and why is Trump using them?",
      "\"In a backdrop of geopolitical uncertainty and ongoing tariff changes, appetite for gold remains strong,\" said Suki Cooper, a precious metals analyst at Standard Chartered.",
      "Victoria Hasler, head of fund research at Hargreaves Lansdown, suggested there were two main drivers behind the gold price at present.",
      "\"Between Trump's tariffs and social media comments and the ongoing tensions in both the Middle East and Russia/Ukraine, uncertainty is high and seems to be rising,\" she said.",
      "\"Markets hate uncertainty. This dynamic has helped to drive the gold price to new highs.\"",
      "The second big driver was central banks buying up gold, Ms Hasler said, but the exact reasons for this were difficult to determine. \"It's probably safe to assume that at least part of the reason is a desire to diversify reserves away from US dollars.",
      "\"Both of the above drivers remain intact and I can't see them diminishing in the near future.\"",
      "Peaks and troughs of the gold price have occurred at some of the key moments in economic history. At the outbreak of the global financial crisis in 2007, investors bought gold as a haven asset, which led to a rise in its price.",
      "Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, cited World Gold Council figures, which showed central banks had added some 1,045 tonnes of gold to their reserves last year - the third year in a row more than 1,000 tonnes had been bought.",
      "He said we were in an \"era in which gold is really starting to shine\".",
      "Since the metal dipped below $1,200 an ounce in late 2018, Mr Mould said prices had \"marched inexorably higher\", driven by several factors including the Covid pandemic and higher government deficits pushing investors to \"warm to gold once more\".",
      "\"Quite which of these issues is now the main driver of gold's renaissance is hard to divine, especially as Donald Trump's tariffs are prompting a debate about how inflationary (or stagflationary) they may prove to be, and how effective they may be at funding the new US President's hoped-for tax cuts,\" he said."

      "It is unclear who at Tesla wrote the letter as it is unsigned, or if Mr Musk was aware of it.",
      "Tesla's share price has dropped 40% since the start of the year. Mr Musk is the carmaker's chief executive and while some have argued his alignment with the Trump administration is hurting its brand, market analysts say the share fall is more about worries over Tesla meeting production targets and a drop in sales over the past year.",
      "In the letter, Tesla said it was making changes to its supply chains to find as many local suppliers for its cars and batteries so it was less reliant on foreign markets.",
      "\"None the less,\" it warned, \"even with aggressive localisation of the supply chain, certain parts and components are difficult or impossible to source within the US.\"",

      "\"We don't process those value-added ingredients into more valuable ingredients here at home,\" says Mr Markham.",
      "From critical minerals and uranium to lumber and soybeans, he argues that this is the moment to change.",
      "\"Canada has long been a successful supplier of raw materials to the world. The opportunity now is to stop exporting the job creation and innovation that comes from processing those materials domestically.\"",

      "Then there's the reality of global trade.",
      "\"Some countries are better at producing some things than other countries are,\" Mr Bartlett says, suggesting that rather than a full reshoring push, diversifying Canada's trade partners might be more practical.",
      "He says that Canada should focus on \"those industries where we have a comparative advantage\", which he says include renewable energy and processing steel and aluminium. Those two metals have now been hit with a 25% tariff if they are exported to the US.",

      "\"Yes, Apple now makes some iPhones in India and [the Taiwanese chipmaker] TSMC has been diversifying to Arizona,\" says Mary Lovely, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute in Washington DC.",
      "\"But China is still a massive part of the supply chain. Relationships with new suppliers take time to develop, they are costly to develop.\"",
      "Research suggests that companies pass on a large proportion of the costs of tariffs by putting up prices. Earlier this month Corie Barry, boss of US electronics retailer Best Buy, said that the \"the vast majority\" of the new tariffs will \"probably be passed on to the consumer\" because vendors in the industry have such small margins.",
      "In February, Taiwanese firm Acer said the price of its laptops would likely rise by 10% based on the 10% duties in place on China at the time, while US group HP has warned its profits would be lower because of the tariffs.",
      "Ms Ghazarian says she may have to raise her prices this year, but worries it could backfire. \"There is a price point where the customer is satisfied with the value of goods provided.",
      "\"The moment I shift above that I start to lose customers. High inflation has squeezed Americans.\"",
      "During Mr Trump's first term, companies such as Apple successfully secured exemptions for products, and we may yet see carve-outs.",
      "Insiders have also suggested Mr Trump views tariffs as a negotiating tactic and could ease them if he wins concessions, as he did when China agreed to buy more American goods in a deal reached in 2020.",
      "Fears of a US economic slowdown could also make him change course.",
      "For the time being, though, tensions look likely to escalate. China, Mexico and Canada have vowed to retaliate against any US duties imposed on them, and this week Mr Trump threatened to double tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminium only to row back at the last minute.",
      "He plans to impose \"reciprocal tariffs\" on the rest of the world soon, and threatened tariff increases of up to 60% on Chinese goods while on the campaign trail.",
      "There is a risk this could drive up the price of tech goods around the world if China is forced to relocate manufacturing to countries where labour costs are higher. Moreover, countries may hit back with tariffs on imported US technology.",
      "Ms Ghazarian says she is worried but at least she's prepared this time. Like many other US business-owners she bulk-ordered extra inventory before Mr Trump took office, and is storing it in her east coast warehouse.",
      "She hopes that will get the company through the next year until it can \"pivot\" again.",

    "published": "Fri, 14 Mar 2025 22:16:48 GMT",
    "summary": "The former banker may not have been elected to office before, but his experience managing global economic crises will help.",
    "story": [
      "The former Bank of England boss, Mark Carney, became Canada's prime minister after he was sworn in on Friday. He will need all his experience handling global economic crises as the country faces a trade war launched by US President Donald Trump.",
      "Mark Carney was the first non-British person to become governor of the Bank of England in its more than 300-year history when he took the job in 2013.",
      "He had previously steered his home country through the Great Recession as the governor of the Bank of Canada, the country's central bank, before being poached for Britain's top banking job.",
      "But unlike most PM-hopefuls, Carney has never held political office. Still, he won the contest to replace outgoing Prime Minister Justin Trudeau handily. Now, he must lead the country through one of its toughest challenges yet - an escalating trade war with its biggest trading partner, the United States.",
      "But holding on to the role of PM will be a fight in and of itself. Canada's next federal election is scheduled for this October, but many expect Carney to call it soon after he is sworn in.",
      "Carney wins race to succeed Trudeau as PMA simple guide to Canada's federal electionHow Trump's threats have changed everything about Canada's politics",
      "Carney wins race to succeed Trudeau as PM",
      "A simple guide to Canada's federal election",
      "How Trump's threats have changed everything about Canada's politics",
      "Early life and childhood",
      "Although Carney has travelled the globe, working in places like New York, London and Tokyo, he was born in the remote northern town of Fort Smith, in the Northwest Territories.",
      "With three out of four grandparents hailing from County Mayo in Ireland, Carney holds both Irish and Canadian citizenship. He got British citizenship in 2018, but recently said he intends to relinquish his British and Irish citizenship because he thinks the prime minister should only hold Canadian citizenship.",
      "The son of a high-school principal, he went to Harvard University on scholarship where he played the most Canadian of sports, ice hockey.",
      "In 1995, he earned his PhD in economics from Oxford University, where he wrote his thesis on whether domestic competition can make an economy more nationally competitive - a subject that is sure to come up as Canada works to make internal trade easier in the face of American tariffs.",
      "\"Mark was an extraordinarily versatile student, rapidly mastering new approaches, perspectives and challenges,\" recalled his former doctoral supervisor Meg Meyer, in a press release sent by the university after Carney won the leadership race.",
      "\"These skills will undoubtedly serve him well as he leads Canada during these turbulent times.\"",
      "Previous experience",
      "In 2003, he left the private sector to join the Bank of Canada as a deputy governor, then worked for the Department of Finance as senior associate deputy minister.",
      "In 2007, he was appointed governor of the Bank of Canada, shortly before global markets crashed, sending the country into a deep recession. His leadership at the central bank is widely praised for helping the country avoid the worst of the crisis.",
      "Although central bankers are notoriously circumspect, he was open about his intentions to keep interest rates low for at least a year, after dramatically cutting them.",
      "That move would be credited for helping businesses keep investing even when the markets sank. He would go on to take a similar approach when he was lured back to London - this time as the governor of the Bank of England.",
      "He is credited with modernising the Bank, appearing much more frequently in the media than his predecessor.",
      "In 2015, the Bank reduced the number of interest rate meetings from 12 to eight a year, and started publishing minutes alongside the announcement of interest rate decisions.",
      "Interest rates were anchored at historic lows when he took over, but he introduced a policy of \"forward guidance\", where the Bank would try to further support the economy and encourage lending by pledging not to raise rates until unemployment fell below 7%.",
      "Confusion about this policy saw an MP compare him to an \"unreliable boyfriend\", a moniker that stuck around long after the original controversy died down.",
      "Unlike previous governors who generally kept a low profile, he made controversial interventions ahead of two big constitutional referendums.",
      "In 2014 he warned that an independent Scotland might have to surrender powers to the UK if it wanted to continue using the pound.",
      "Before the Brexit referendum, he warned that a vote to leave the EU could spark a recession.",
      "In the wake of the leave vote, after David Cameron resigned as prime minister and the pound plunged, he addressed the nation in a bid to reassure the country that the financial system would operate as normal.",
      "He described it as his \"toughest day\" on the job, but said the contingency plans the Bank put in place worked effectively.",
      "The Bank later cut interest rates from 0.5% to 0.25% - and restarted its quantitative easing programme to support the economy.",
      "His final week in March 2020 saw the start of the acutest phase of the Covid pandemic - the Bank cut rates by 0.5% to support the economy, and Carney told the country that the economic shock \"should be temporary\".",
      "Crossing paths with Trump",
      "Carney's time at the Bank gave him plenty of experience dealing with Donald Trump - who has not only imposed steep tariffs on Canada since returning to office in January, but has also suggested that America should annex its less powerful neighbour.",
      "From 2011-18, Carney was chair of the Financial Stability Board, which co-ordinated the work of regulatory authorities around the world, giving him a key role in the global response to the policies of the first Trump presidency.",
      "He was a regular at the G20 meetings, with a pitch-side view of Trump on the global stage.",
      "Although he kept his thoughts on the US president to himself at the time, he has been much more frank in recent days.",
      "After Trump made repeated comments about making Canada the 51st state, he was less diplomatic, comparing him to the villain in the Harry Potter books.",
      "\"When you think about what's at stake in these ridiculous, insulting comments of the president, of what we could be, I view this as the sort of Voldemort of comments,\" Carney said.",
      "\"Like I will not even repeat it, but you know what I'm talking about.\"",
      "He seems prepared to dig in his heels as the trade war continues, noting he would continue to impose counter-tariffs \"until the Americans show us respect \u2026 and [make] credible and reliable commitments to free and fair trade\".",
      "Political ambitions",
      "The Liberals have reportedly courted him for a decade, but until recently the 59-year-old had brushed off the idea.",
      "\"Why don't I become a circus clown?\" he told a reporter in 2012.",
      "Things changed, however, when Trudeau stepped down in January after his finance minister, Chrystia Freeland quit his cabinet, sparking a party squabble that, coupled with Trudeau's tanking poll numbers, led the prime minister to announce his resignation.",
      "Reports suggested Trudeau had intended to replace Freeland with Carney in the finance post.",
      "Freeland - a personal friend - even ran against him in the race to replace Trudeau. But Carney won by a landslide, pitching himself as the best equipped to take on Trump, who has imposed steep tariffs on Canadians goods.",
      "\"I know how to manage crises,\" Carney said during a leadership debate late last month. \"In a situation like this, you need experience in terms of crisis management, you need negotiating skills.\"",
      "Still, his time in the world of finance has opened him up to criticism from political rivals in Canada.",
      "The Conservatives have accused Carney of lying about his role in moving investment firm Brookfield Asset Management's head office from Toronto to New York, though Carney says the recent formal decision to relocate the firm was made after he quit the board.",
      "They have also pushed him to disclose his financial assets, which Carney currently does not need to do as he is not an elected member of parliament.",
      "His team has said he will comply with all applicable ethics rules and guidelines once he is prime minister.",
      "Where does Carney stand on issues?",
      "In addition to Carney's get-tough-on-Trump approach, he has proposed a number of policies to address at-home issues as well.",
      "He is known as an advocate for environmental sustainability. In 2019 he became a UN special envoy for climate change, and in 2021 launched the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero, a grouping of banks and financial institutions working to combat climate change.",
      "One of the most contentious parts of Trudeau's platform has been the carbon tax, which saw Canadians pay a tax on carbon emissions, and receive a rebate. Conservatives repeatedly promised to end the tax, which they say does little for the environment.",
      "Shortly after being sworn in, Carney signed an order-in-council scrapping the tax from 1 April. \"This will make a difference to hard-pressed Canadians,\" he said.",
      "On immigration, Carney has advocated for a cap on current immigration targets, in order to ensure that Canada's housing and healthcare systems are not stressed. The issue had come to the fore last year, with Trudeau lowering targets amid critics saying the country's immigration system was overrun.",
      "His biggest mission, he had said, will be to keep Canada's economy growing, despite slowed trade with the US.",
      "There are early signs that Carney's rhetoric is being well received - a recent poll, conducted before Carney became PM, indicated Canadians believe Carney is better able to deal with Trump than Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre."

      "Speaking to the Daily Telegraph, Ms Spielman claims \"effective reforms are being reversed\" - referring to potential changes to academy schools' powers.",

      "Ms Spielman stepped down as head of Ofsted at the end of 2023.",
      "An inquiry into Ofsted was launched that year, after the death of head teacher Ruth Perry, who died by suicide following an Ofsted inspection.",

      "But Ms Spielman claimed the changes to Ofsted were being done \"to please unions\", by making it \"much less likely that inspection will detect weaknesses or convey a negative message.\"",
      "Speaking to Radio 4's World at One programme, Ms Spielman said she thought it was \"surprising\" that education unions were approached for comments on stories about Ofsted.",
      "A government source's comment, which said Ms Spielman should \"spend less time criticising the reforms this government is bringing, and more time reflecting on her failure at Ofsted\", was also put to the ex-Ofsted boss during the interview.",

    "summary": "Plans to axe a fifth of the workforce at Dundee University have drawn attention to problems in the sector.",
    "story": [
      "Scotland's universities are hitting a crunch point with their finances, forcing job losses on a scale we used to see from major factory closures and raising questions about whether they can all survive.",
      "Dundee University is cutting 632 full-time jobs \u2013 a fifth of its workforce - as it tries to tackle a \u00a335m deficit, and its underlying financial position looks even worse.",
      "The University of Edinburgh is looking to make \u00a3140m of cuts over the next 18 months. That figure is equivalent to about a tenth of the annual spending at the institution, which now has about 15,000 staff on its payroll.",
      "Aberdeen University has also cut staff through voluntary redundancy programmes, while the city's Robert Gordon University has put 135 roles \"at risk\" - which usually means they are bound to go.",
      "It has been suggested that more than 80 universities across the UK face deficits of between \u00a310m and \u00a350m, with Durham and Cardiff both planning significant spending cuts.",
      "When the Scottish Funding Council publishes its delayed annual assessment of the sector, it is expected to say that more than half of Scotland's institutions are running a deficit.",
      "They all face similar pressures, but some have done better than others at foreseeing the danger and planning for it.",
      "So what are the challenges facing the sector in Scotland?",
      "The level of student funding",
      "Scottish students get \"free tuition\". Undergraduates don't have to pay fees for their courses if they can secure one of the limited number of places.",
      "The Scottish government has committed to pay the tuition costs, which it does through the Scottish Funding Council (SFC).",
      "Universities Scotland, which represents the 18 institutions, says that level of funding has not kept pace with inflation or with the number of students.",
      "It says there has been a decade of under-investment by the Scottish government in the higher education sector.",
      "The figures differ according to how you measure inflation, but it told MSPs that funding per student had fallen by 39% in real terms.",
      "It says research funding from the government is down by 43% since 2014/15, and its members say Scotland has lost much of the sizeable lead it held over the rest of the UK in attracting research funding.",
      "While the Scottish government proudly points to its provision of \u00a31.1bn for the sector, the Institute for Fiscal Studies has noted that the \u00a31,810 fee per student has not changed for 15 years.",
      "But that's far from all the money allocated. With block grants for tuition, the average being spent per student was calculated as \u00a37,530 this year.",
      "Using a different measure for inflation, the IFS says spending per student is down by 22% since 2013. Half of that reduction has been in the most recent three years, when costs have been rising most steeply.",
      "The IFS said that while the surplus of Scottish universities stood at 5.2% in 2022/23, it has concerns that finances are getting rapidly worse.",
      "How does that compare with elsewhere?",
      "Undergraduates in the rest of the UK are required to pay fees, often building up debt to do so.",
      "These are capped at \u00a39,250 per year for a typical three-year degree course - less for part-time students, more for accelerated courses.",
      "Students from the rest of the UK must pay an equivalent amount to study at Scottish universities, although the cost is usually spread over the four years of a Scottish degree.",
      "While the number of Scottish students is capped, there is no limit on the number of undergraduates from elsewhere. As a result, they became an important source of income for Scottish institutions.",
      "However, the growth in funding per student has not kept up with inflation. It has been increased only slightly from \u00a39,000 in 2012.",
      "The maximum annual fee is going up next year by nearly \u00a3300 to compensate universities for the higher cost of employer National Insurance contributions from next month, but there is no equivalent increase for Scottish students funded through Holyrood.",
      "Because England and Wales have more open competition to recruit students - and attract their fee income - there have been sharper divergences in financial fortunes than you'll see in Scotland, where the SFC allocates places to institutions.",
      "The more prestigious Russell Group of research-rich universities have gone after the students that would previously have gone to middle-ranking institutions, leaving the latter financially flailing.",
      "The vice-chancellors of English universities complain that fees fail to cover the cost of educating undergraduates. Yet the total they receive is around \u00a32,500 per student higher than the funding for Scottish-based students doing courses in Scotland.",
      "With these shortfalls in income compared with costs, there had to be a new stream of funding, and that's where foreign fees have become a vital part of the solution - and the problem.",
      "The overseas recruitment drive",
      "UK universities have been on a recruitment splurge to draw in students from other parts of the world, charging them much higher fees than UK students \u2013 from about \u00a310,000 up to \u00a340,000 per year.",
      "The number of European Union students fell by half as Britain left the EU, but the numbers from other countries have soared. The share of foreign students has risen from one in 20 in the 1990s to more than one in four.",
      "For those with a prestigious reputation, including Scotland's older universities, the share of foreign students has been closer to 40%.",
      "The most recent figures show there were about 750,000 international students studying in the UK in 2022/23 - with the number of new arrivals almost doubling in the space of five years.",
      "This has brought controversy - about the quality of learning, standards of English language ability, and the surge in demand for student accommodation.",
      "It has also brought vulnerability if the demand for places falls away.",
      "Growth in foreign fees swelled university income, and the increase was most marked as the pandemic ended, reaching a peak in 2022.",
      "It fell by 5% the following year, and is thought to have continued falling - quite steeply for some universities.",
      "The volatility of that income stream reflects many international factors.",
      "A growing concern about universities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, becoming too dependent on Chinese students saw recruitment shift to other countries.",
      "Chinese recruitment remains high, but has stopped growing, and post-grads are down.",
      "Nigeria was one new target, encouraged by the UK government.",
      "But the market there depends on the strength of the Nigerian currency, which fell sharply and cut off the number of people who could afford to come to the UK.",
      "Dundee was one of the universities hit hard by the falling numbers.",
      "Numbers were also affected by visa restrictions.",
      "In order to meet pressure to cut immigration numbers, the Conservative government increased the annual fee for using the NHS and made it more difficult for graduates to reach the pay threshold for a work visa after they graduate.",
      "It also restricted visas for students' family dependents.",
      "The biggest cash cow among foreign students has been in taught post-graduate degrees.",
      "These tend to be older students with families who won't come if there is a restriction on partners and families.",
      "Some international markets are sensitive to the signals sent out by the UK government, including India, where UK visa changes and reports of attacks on Indian students in British universities can make the front page of national newspapers.",
      "A further factor is that competition has been growing.",
      "The UK used to see its main competitors for English-language degrees as the US, Canada and Australia.",
      "That now extends to about 20 countries, including Ireland and Singapore and extending to polyglot Holland and Germany.",
      "What about spending?",
      "To increase capacity for teaching and studying for all those additional students, universities have had to increase spending.",
      "And with more foreign fee income, they have been investing in buildings and equipment as well as more staff.",
      "Ten years ago, Edinburgh University had 35,000 students and an income of \u00a3819m, with expenditure of \u00a3793m.",
      "In 2023/24, student numbers were nearing 50,000 and income was at \u00a31.43bn, with expenditure of \u00a31.3bn.",
      "That level of increased activity is harder to handle where there are so many moving parts to the income.",
      "It becomes impossible if financial planners fail to see the risk that the growth in foreign student fee income can stall and reverse, while they continue with expansion plans, prestigious new buildings and more debt.",
      "So what happens next?",
      "An external inquiry will be carried out at Dundee University, which is expected to highlight major management failures and a shonky IT system for student recruitment.",
      "Its interim principal, Prof Shane O'Neill, says the financial crisis has \"challenged us to ask some very fundamental questions about the size, shape, balance and structure of the university\".",
      "Dundee's response points to job losses and a narrowing of course options for students. Fewer modules will be offered, and that may also be the case elsewhere.",
      "Subjects that don't bring in enough income will be vulnerable.",
      "Language departments are a common target when cuts are needed. There's not much research or consultancy income, and there's competition from commercial software.",
      "The Scottish Funding Council faces deficits in the majority of the institutions it funds, and pressure from Holyrood ministers to make sure the pain is eased and that no institution is allowed to fail.",
      "But money is tight, and there are limited powers to intervene because these are autonomous institutions.",
      "Dundee University to cut 632 jobs to plug \u00a335m deficit",
      "Edinburgh University to seek \u00a3140m in savings",
      "Record foreign student numbers at Scottish universities",
      "Some see sense in mergers, cutting out the duplication of back office costs and the notoriously high salaries of principals.",
      "Others see shared services and teaching space as the way to go, with other universities, colleges and with other organisations such as the NHS.",
      "And there may be value in a crisis such as this.",
      "With a period of rapid growth now ended, one principal told me this is the time to reflect on what university is for: how to re-shape Scotland's universities towards the needs of the next 20 to 30 years, using artificial intelligence in learning and teaching.",
      "On funding, that principal warned said we need to move on from the simplistic \"fee or free\" argument over tuition costs in Scotland.",
      "What comes out of that reflection matters profoundly to Scotland, to its people and to its economy.",
      "In the various scenarios for Scotland's economic future, universities form the one sector where there is world-leading expertise and reputation.",
      "Scotland punches above its weight. But if it is to continue doing so, it will have to change."

      "Thieves smashed their way in and ripped out the fully functional toilet, hours after a glamorous launch party at the Oxfordshire stately home in September 2019.",
      "Michael Jones was found guilty of planning the burglary. Fred Doe was convicted of conspiring to sell the gold, while Bora Guccuk was cleared of the same charge.",
      "The BBC can now reveal the full criminal history of the heist gang's kingpin James Sheen. He has been jailed at least six times since 2005 and has led organised crime groups that made more than \u00a35m from fraud and theft - money authorities have largely failed to recover.",
      "Five men were seen on CCTV carrying out the heist, but only two - Sheen and Jones - have ever been caught.",
      "Within days the artwork, called America, had been broken up and sold on, the court heard. None of the gold has been recovered.",
      "Sheen, from Oxford, pleaded guilty last year after police found his DNA at the scene and gold fragments in his clothing. He was described in court as the \"common denominator\" - having been charged with planning and transferring criminal property, as well as burglary.",
      "The 40-year-old, who has previous convictions for fraud, theft and a firearms offence, was arrested four weeks after the heist, on suspicion of planning it, but he was released on bail.",
      "He continued his crime spree, including a similar raid eight months later at the National Horseracing Museum in Newmarket, Suffolk, where he stole gold and silver trophies worth \u00a3400,000, none of which have ever been recovered.",
      "The court heard how the gang had meticulously researched the burglary at Blenheim Palace - a UNESCO World Heritage Site to the north of Oxford.",
      "Jones visited the palace for a second time the day before the heist, and took pictures of the golden toilet, a lock on the door and a nearby window. Later that day, the artist Maurizio Cattelan hosted his launch party.",
      "A few hours after guests left, the gang used two stolen cars to ram through palace gates, smash a window, wrench the toilet from its fittings and roll it out of the building, the court heard.",
      "The BBC has discovered they exploited a series of security flaws at the palace - where there were no guards patrolling the exhibition or the grounds. Overnight, the artwork was locked behind a thin wooden door and was not monitored by CCTV.",
      "External CCTV showed the gang were inside for less than three minutes. Palace chief executive Dominic Hare told the BBC the \"facts speak for themselves\".",
      "\"We took possession of this precious item and managed to lose it within a day,\" he said, because the thieves simply \"drove through the gates, smashed through the window, they picked it up and they went\".",
      "Police arrived within five minutes of the alarm sounding, but the thieves had already left.",
      "As a work of art, the toilet weighed 98kg (216lbs) and was insured for $6m (\u00a34.8m). Gold prices at the time would have meant the metal alone was worth \u00a32.8m, the court was told."

      "\"I fall into rabbit holes on YouTube. A lot of them. New music writing software, things about health, tech things.\"",
      "That is his explanation as to why he has not made an album for 15 years.",
      "\"I get victimised by it, so to speak, but that's life,\" he chuckles.",
      "Speaking from his house in west Hollywood, the ridiculously sprightly 84-year-old pianist has never been afraid to embrace technology, but normally he is the one doing the mastering, not vice versa.",
      "Hancock's half century... and more",
      "Discovered by trumpeter Donald Byrd at the start of the 60s, Hancock signed to Blue Note Records, and wrote jazz standards including Watermelon Man, Cantaloupe Island and Maiden Voyage.",
      "In the 70s he was an early adopter of synthesisers, blending genres with the electro-funk classic Head Hunters.",
      "In the 80s, he had a bona fide worldwide hit single with Rockit after embracing turntablism and scratching, winning five awards at the first ever MTV Awards for its classic dancing robots video.",
      "Deee Lite's Groove Is in the Heart? The riff that drives that song is a sample from Hancock's Blow-Up soundtrack. Madonna, Janet Jackson and NWA are amonst the plethora of performers to have incorporated his music into their own.",
      "While as recently as 2008, he beat Amy Winehouse and Kanye West to win his first album of the year award at the Grammys.",
      "The reason we are talking is that Hancock has been announced as one of the recipients of this year's Polar Music Prize, the closest music has to a Nobel prize.",
      "Previous laureates have included Sir Paul McCartney, Dizzy Gillespie, Stevie Wonder, Bob Dylan, Joni Mitchell and Quincy Jones.",
      "\"It's a huge, fantastic list of people I've admired,\" says Hancock before expressing particular delight that the saxophonist Wayne Shorter was chosen for the honour in 2017, six years before his death. Together they made up two fifths of Miles Davis's Second Great Quintet.",
      "Working with Miles Davis",
      "Joy comes over Hancock's face when reminiscing about the period between 1964 to 1968, when he toured the world with the man Rolling Stone magazine called \"the most revered jazz trumpeter of all time\".",
      "\"I was always frightened playing with Miles,\" he laughs.",
      "\"It was very intimidating. I always wanted to be at my best, because I admired him so much. He was such a big part in my own development as a musician.",
      "\"It was fear on one hand. On the other hand, it was exciting. And when things were at their best, it was really inspiring. When were all in sync, that made life worth living.\"",
      "On the pianist's favourite distraction, YouTube, there is a clip that has been viewed almost five million times, showing a furious Davis, on stage in Milan in 1964, stopping his improvised solo to send dagger eyes at Hancock.",
      "Online there is much debate as to what caused this trumpet temper tantrum. But for Hancock, this was a regular occurrence.",
      "\"A lot of times I would be surprised at what would upset Miles, what would make him a little angry. I didn't always know. He was not always easy to figure out, so I got used to that slight discomfort,\" he says grinning.",
      "\"That's life. But I was always looking to learn from those discomforts.\"",
      "And when he embarks on his European tour this summer, which includes three UK dates at London's Barbican, Hancock will be thinking about another lesson he learnt from Davis - this one about the make-up of his audience.",
      "He adopts a low, deep whispering voice and does a full-on Miles Davis impression, recreating the conversation from the mid 1960s, when the trumpeter gave him a stern warning: \"If all you see are dudes in the audience, that means your music is dead.\"",
      "Herbie Hancock is pretending to be Miles Davis to an audience of me. It is a glorious moment.",
      "\"He used more expletives than I just did,\" Hancock chortles. \"But you get the idea,\" clearly enjoying his mimicry as much as I did.",
      "Hancock has been playing the piano for almost 80 years, but the instrument still gives him so much joy, that on occasion, during a session on the keys, he finds himself sobbing.",
      "\"If I've solved some kind of problem that I've had with the tune and made some kind of discovery that surpassed my expectations, I've been known to cry, to have tears coming down my face.\"",
      "I ask what kind of problem leaves him reaching for Herbie hankies.",
      "\"It's difficult to explain,\" he responds, \"But, trying to make something work out, where there's no easy answer. Where, 'this is not supposed to work', but 'how can I make it work?'\"",
      "It feels like we have been invited inside Hancock's brain and are seeing the cogs turn. At speed.",
      "He continues: \"There may be something that I want to connect, but all the ways I know of connecting them are not the solution. And I have to find some other means.",
      "\"And sometimes that [means] can come from looking at it in a different way. And not necessarily through music.\"",
      "This answer goes a long way to explaining the difference between someone who is a musical genius and someone who is not.",

    "summary": "The theft of an oil sketch from a stately home in Northamptonshire remained a riddle for 70 years.",
    "story": [
      "An Exeter University art historian has solved the 70-year mystery over the theft of an original oil sketch, by Flemish painter Anthony van Dyck, from a stately home in Northamptonshire.",
      "The Portrait of Wolfgang Wilhelm of Pfalz-Neuburg was stolen in 1951 from Boughton House, the home of the Duke of Buccleuch and Queensberry.",
      "It was part of a collection - described as \"a puzzle missing a central piece\" - of 17th Century oil sketches that had been housed at the property since 1682.",
      "But the artwork's disappearance was only noted in 1957, when Mary Montagu Douglas Scott, Duchess of Buccleuch and Queensberry, visited one of Harvard University's galleries - and saw it on display.",
      "Now, thanks to an investigation by Dr Meredith Hale, senior lecturer in Art History and Visual Culture at the University of Exeter, the riddle of how the sketch made its way to the US via prominent members of the art world - including Christie's auction house in London - has been solved.",
      "Dr Hale noted how through \"new archival research in the UK, US and Canada\" she was able to \"reconstruct the painting's movements over three generations\".",
      "She said it \"passed through the hands of experts, conservators, auctioneers, dealers, and collectors from London to Toronto\".",
      "\"Not only do these sources reveal a dynamic picture of events as they unfold,\" she added, \"but they highlight the factors that contributed to the success of the theft, foremost among them the conceptual and material complexity of Van Dyck's iconography project - and the audacity of a thief cloaked in the respectability of expertise.\"",
      "The artwork has now been returned and the story of its journey has been chronicled in a new paper in the British Art Journal.",
      "Money for new curtains",
      "The thief, Dr Hale said, was Leonard Gerald Gwynne Ramsey, the editor of the journal The Connoisseur, and a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries.",
      "Ramsey visited Boughton in July 1951 with a photographer in order to gather material for a piece for the journal's year book.",
      "Among the objects housed at the property for safekeeping during the war were the 37 wooden panels from Van Dyck's unfinished iconography project.",
      "Each panel featured an oil-painted sketch of a prominent prince, scholar, military leader or artist, and would have been used to create prints for sale.",
      "Correspondence between Ramsey and art historian Ludwig Goldscheider revealed that the former intended to sell two paintings because he needed the money to buy new curtains.",
      "According to the research, Goldscheider supplied a certificate of authentication and the picture was sold anonymously at Christie's for \u00a3189 in April 1954.",
      "Dr Hale traced the sale of the picture, less than a year later, to an art dealer in New York, before it moved on to a second dealer who sold it for $2,700 to Dr Lillian Malcove; who in turn donated it to the Fogg Art Museum of Harvard University.",
      "In her paper, Dr Hale chronicles terse correspondences between the museum's art director, Professor John Coolidge, and Ramsey once concerns had been raised by the duchess.",
      "Ramsey, it shows, claimed he'd bought the picture from a market in Hemel Hempstead, and he also attempted to cast doubt on the authenticity of the picture.",
      "With doubts growing, the museum returned the picture to Dr Malcove in 1960, and after she died in 1981, it was donated to the Art Museum of the University of Toronto.",
      "Dr Hale said the findings have helped to \"resolve the question of whether this was the picture stolen from Boughton\".",
      "It resulted in the executive committee of the University of Toronto voting to return it to the Duke of Buccleuch, 73 years after it was stolen.",
      "\"Without this painting, the Boughton oil sketches were like a puzzle that's missing a central piece,\" said Dr Hale.",
      "\"Its return has now restored the integrity of the group.\"",

      "James Lee Williams, better known as drag star The Vivienne, died from a cardiac arrest caused by the effects of taking ketamine, their family has said.",
      "The performer's sister Chanel Williams said her family \"continue to be completely devastated\" by the death of the 32-year-old and will be working with a substance abuse charity to raise awareness of the dangers of the drug.",
      "The RuPaul's Drag Race UK winner was found dead at their home in Cheshire in January, with celebrities and fans around the world paying tribute.",
      "An inquest is scheduled to take place in June.",
      "Cheshire Police said there are no suspicious circumstances surrounding the performer's death.",
      "Simon Jones, Williams' manager and close friend, said the family felt it was important to share the circumstances of their death.",
      "He said: \"I hope by us releasing this information we can raise awareness about the dangers of ongoing ketamine usage and what it can do to your body.\"",
      "Williams, who grew up in Colwyn Bay in north Wales before moving to Liverpool, won the first series of RuPaul's Drag Race UK in 2019 and went on to have a varied career in TV and theatre.",
      "They later became the only queen from a UK series to compete on the US version of Drag Race All Stars.",
      "Their family said they \"brought the sparkle to life\" and will be missed \"for eternity\" during an emotional vigil in Liverpool shortly after Williams' death.",

      "Clueless has been brought to the stage by the film's original writer and director Amy Heckerling - who says keeping the 90s theme was integral to the show.",
      "Heckerling insists she has \"no interest in being modern\" - which will come as a relief to the audiences who grew up quoting \"As if!\" and aspiring to Cher's plaid and Prada-filled wardrobe.",
      "The story follows the life of the na\u00efve and lovably spoiled teenager, who plays matchmaker with her friends before ultimately finding love herself.",
      "An adaption of Jane Austen's Emma, Clueless captured the teen spirit of the 90s and inspired countless school dramas like Mean Girls, Gossip Girl and Legally Blonde.",
      "The stage version has songs in the form of an original score by singer-songwriter KT Tunstall.",
      "Speaking to the BBC, Tunstall says the film was \"omnipotent\" in the 90s and influenced everything from the clothes people wore to the music people listened to.",
      "The Scottish singer, best known for songs like Black Horse and the Cherry Tree and Suddenly I See, says working on the show was a \"dream project\".",
      "She says the original soundtrack was a big inspiration, and describes the music as \"a mixtape of all your favourite 90s bangers\".",
      "The process of creating the soundtrack for Clueless: The Musical was intense for Tunstall, who says it's no easy feat to add music to an adaptation of a film that didn't originally have it.",
      "\"You really have to think about whether a song fits the structure and flow of the story and whether it actually helps the audience understand the narrative better,\" she says.",
      "Heckerling says she actually wishes the film had been a musical because \"there were natural moments in the script where characters could have sung\".",
      "\"Those types of films weren't very common in the 90s but I'm glad we could add in music now,\" she says.",
      "Critics had mixed thoughts about the new songs - the Guardian called them \"disappointingly flat-footed\" in a two-star review and said the lyrics \"too often serve as exposition rather than raising the emotional drama\".",
      "Similarly, the Telegraph's Dominic Cavendish wrote that the show has \"numbers designed to sound in keeping with the period but which are so generic they don't ring with real-world authenticity\".",
      "But What'sOnStage praised Tunstall's \"infuriatingly catchy tunes\" and Glenn Slater's \"nifty, witty lyrics\".",
      "For Emma Flynn, who is making her West End debut as Cher, the music has another important function in the show - it allows characters to easily share their inner thoughts with the audience.",
      "\"In the film you hear these really funny inner monologues of Cher, but the great thing about this show is you can hear all of the character's thoughts, which makes you feel more connected to them.\"",
      "Flynn has been praised by critics, with the Evening Standard noting her \"powerfully-sung breakout performance\" and describing it as channelling \"both Alicia Silverstone in the original movie and Sabrina Carpenter today, while making the role entirely her own\".",
      "Co-star Keelan McAuley, who plays nerdy Josh, tells the BBC he loves the play's nostalgia factor.",

      "The show stays almost entirely true to the 1995 film, with everyone sporting the latest 90s fashions, carrying a glitzy pager, and listening to angsty teen bangers on a Walkman.",
      "While it may feel like a nostalgia fest, Heckerling admits she doesn't \"like to stick to real life\", and even her sunny film was far from the reality of what the 90s were like for most teenagers in LA, with race riots and other political problems.",
      "The Independent's three-star review says the show \"sticks to the original movie like chewing gum to the underside of a school desk\" at first, but changes tack by the second half.",
      "\"[Director Rachel] Kavanaugh and Heckerling gain the confidence to part ways a bit from the movie's script, and to let the story's heart show,\" Alice Saville wrote.",
      "For Tunstall, what sets Clueless apart from traditional rom-coms and high school dramas is that there isn't a typical villain and there's no nastiness or bad intentions from the main characters.",
      "Jane Austen famously thought her main character wouldn't be a widely liked heroine, but Tunstall says she is often people's favourite character because of her honesty and depth.",
      "\"People can relate to her on a deeper level, like how she is trying to process the death of her mother and help keep her family in order.",

    "story": [
      "Netflix's latest big-budget film The Electric State, starring Millie Bobby Brown and Chris Pratt, is one of the most expensive movies ever made, and had some of the most scathing reviews in recent memory. But that doesn't mean it will flop.",
      "Film critics haven't minced their words when delivering their verdicts on The Electric State.",
      "It is \"a turgid eyesore\" and \"top-dollar tedium\", according to the Times. It's \"slick but dismally soulless\", declared the Hollywood Reporter, while the New York Times called it  \"obvious, garish and just plain dumb\".",
      "Paste pointed out its eye-watering budget, billing it as \"the most banal way you can spend $320m\". Warming to the theme, the magazine summed it up as \"one hell of an artistically neutered, sanitized boondoggle\".",
      "There have been some kinder reviews. Empire said it was \"breezily watchable\" and worth three stars, while the Telegraph awarded four stars to the \"Spielbergian treat\".",
      "But overall, its 15% Rotten Tomatoes score is a meagre return for any major film, especially one costing such a lot. The $320m (\u00a3247m) figure has been widely reported but neither confirmed nor denied by Netflix. It would make The Electric State the most expensive streaming film ever.",
      "Critics' opinions, however, have become more irrelevant in the streaming age. The bad reviews didn't stop The Electric State from going straight to number one on Netflix's chart after its release on Friday.",
      "It fits into Netflix making star-packed, entertaining and escapist movies that often get panned by reviewers - but are watched by hundreds of millions of subscribers.",
      "\"I would love to say that what I've written and what other critics have written will matter, but I just don't think it will,\" says Digital Spy movies editor Ian Sandwell.",
      "Sandwell awarded the film two stars out of five, noting that the action and visual effects are \"decent\", the robots are \"impressive\" and the finale is \"epic\".",
      "\"My main problem was they'd created this really impressive, visually spectacular world and then just told quite a generic seen-it-all-before story inside it,\" he says.",
      "Bad reviews might have put people off paying to see the film if it had been released in cinemas, he says. \"But on Netflix, I think it will still be absolutely massive. I don't think bad reviews will matter at all.\"",
      "While a critic's job is to analyse a movie, \"audiences probably do just want a big, spectacular blockbuster to watch at home, with two massive stars\", he adds.",
      "The Electric State follows Brown, Pratt and a succession of zany robots in an alternative version of 1990s America, where there has been a war between humans and intelligent bots.",
      "It also stars Ke Huy Quan, Stanley Tucci and the voices of Woody Harrelson and Brian Cox, and is directed by Anthony and Joe Russo - who have made four Marvel movies, including the wildly successful Avengers: Infinity War and Endgame.",
      "The Electric State is based on the graphic novel by Simon St\u00e5lenhag, although some critics pointed out that Netflix had missed the book's point about the perils of a consumerist society addicted to technology.",
      "The film is \"absolutely not\" value for money in terms of quality, says City AM's film editor Victoria Luxford.",
      "And it remains to be seen whether the film makes financial sense for Netflix, she says.",
      "The streaming giant's most popular ever film, 2021's Red Notice, has had 231 million views, according to Netflix's measurements.",
      "\"The Electric State will be hoping for that kind of performance, just as a $320m theatrically released movie would be aiming to break box office records,\" Luxford says.",
      "\"The higher the price, the higher the target for success, even with a business model as opaque as Netflix's.\"",
      "Red Notice, an action-packed art crime caper starring Dwayne Johnson, Gal Gadot and Ryan Reynolds, has a lukewarm 39% critics' score on Rotten Tomatoes - but a 92% audience rating.",
      "Other recent Netflix hits have been lapped up by viewers more than reviewers.",
      "Brooke Shields' lightweight multi-generational rom-com Mother of the Bride has a 13% critics' score, Jennifer Lopez's AI action thriller Atlas is on 19%, Cameron Diaz and Jamie Foxx's family spy escapade Back In Action has 29%, and Kevin Hart's heist comedy Lift is on 30%.",
      "They are enjoyable but forgettable - and easy to watch in the midst of potential distractions at home. The Hollywood Reporter described Atlas as \"another Netflix movie made to half-watch while doing laundry\" - summing up this new genre.",

    "story": [
      "As Donatella Versace steps down from designing after 27 years at the helm of the Italian brand, the fashion world has been reflecting on her achievements and what this means for the future.",
      "The 69-year-old took over the family business after her brother Gianni was murdered in 1997, with many unsure whether she had what it takes to steer the fashion house.",
      "Her appointment was seen at the time as \"a sentimental appointment by a shell-shocked family,\" the Guardian's fashion editor Jess Cartner-Morley wrote.",
      "But she proved the doubters wrong, anointing herself in the process as a global fashion icon.",
      "She leaves the job as \"one of the most successful female designers in modern fashion history\", Cartner-Morley added.",
      "New York Times fashion director Vanessa Friedman declared that Donatella \"wore her struggles - with personal tragedy, self-doubt, finding her creative feet, and drugs - with as much aplomb as her long platinum hair\".",
      "As singer and Versace ambassador Dua Lipa put it in a tribute on Instagram: \"No-one does it like you @donatella_versace!!!!!\"",
      "She did it all with \"grit, kindness and, even in the troughs of addiction, an infectious sense of humour\", the Telegraph's head of fashion Lisa Armstrong wrote.",
      "However,  Versace \"never set a fashion agenda\" under Donatella as it had under her brother, Armstrong added - but her \"nose for a story could nevertheless produce fashion magic\".",
      "Her magic moments included dressing Jennifer Lopez in the green jungle dress at the 2000 Grammy Awards, generating so much interest that Google created its image search function.",
      "As former Miu Miu design director Dario Vitale takes over, Donatella will now become an ambassador for the Versace brand.",
      "The big question is what that means for both the company and Donatella herself, who has poured her life into the company, dealing with grief, drug addiction and divorce along the way?",
      "Speculation is growing over whether the company will be sold to the Prada Group by its current owner Capri Holdings.",
      "Capri paid \u20ac2bn (\u00a31.67bn) for the fashion house in 2018 and owns other companies such as Michael Kors.",
      "Prada has been credited with developing a strong vision in recent years, which has translated to healthy sales during a climate of slowdown in the fashion economy.",
      "Imran Amed, CEO of The Business of Fashion, told the BBC World Service that \"Versace is one of the most iconic brands in the fashion industry\" and has \"a very clear design and brand DNA\".",
      "He believes it \"would be a mistake to dilute\" the company or merge it with another, so hopes that if Versace is bought, the vision is to grow it into something bigger.",
      "Amed said Versace makes about $1bn (\u00a3772m) a year, while rivals such as Louis Vuitton and Gucci make $20bn (\u00a315.5bn) and $8bn (\u00a36.2bn) respectively.",
      "Some have touted that Versace's failure to expand into the beauty industry and other affordable luxuries is why it has been left behind financially by its rivals.",
      "Luisa Zargani, Milan bureau chief for Women's Wear Daily, said Donatella had probably stepped back because she knows a \"moment of creative upheaval\" is coming for the brand.",
      "\"There has been a lot of talk about the future of Versace and for the last few years she has been very involved with all her charity work, so she will continue to do [that] while continuing to be part of the Versace family,\" she told BBC News.",
      "Zargani said Donatella \"has always championed young designers\" such as Christopher Kane, Jonathan Anderson and Anthony Vaccarello, and she expects her to continue to be involved as Vitale moves from Miu Miu.",
      "\"[Vitale] is a very solid designer, he's very steady, very creative and has been key in building Miu Miu, so I'm sure she has had her input in this,\" Zargani added.",
      "Friedman said Donatella had probably been thinking about her succession plan \"for a while\".",
      "\"There's a lot of turmoil in the luxury industry at large, and she may have decided it was time for a change,\" she told the World Service's Newshour.",
      "Friedman called her replacement \"a very talented designer\", adding: \"He's been working behind the scenes at Miu Miu for two years and it has been the single hottest brand in fashion over that time period.\"",
      "Vitale has helped steer the brand to record profits, which she said was \"mind boggling\" when \"every other brand in the fashion world has declined during that period\".",
      "Versace herself can be proud of how she has successfully transformed from her brother's muse to a fashion powerhouse, Friedman added.",
      "\"She wasn't the person toiling away with pattern-making back in the atelier, but she really did prove herself, and more credit to her.\"",
      "Donatella's final show earlier this month was staged in a tram station in northern Milan, drawing some of the world's biggest celebrities - once again showcasing how her star power has helped keep the brand a talking point in the fashion world.",
      "Friedman said the show, which featured the brand's signature bold aesthetic, \"reflected the fuzziness around the fate of Versace\" by lacking any clear direction.",
      "Her exit was not announced at the show, but many speculated it was coming because the collection featured references to her late brother's final designs from autumn/winter 1997.",
      "Everyone is now talking about what Donatella does next.",
      "A book or documentary about her would undoubtedly be well received. She is also an advocate for several women's and LGBTQ charities, so could increase her input into those in the future. But she will continue to cast a shadow over the catwalk."

    "story": [
      "Plans to overhaul the benefits system are to be announced later in a move aimed at cutting the growing welfare bill.",
      "Changes to personal independence payments (PIP) are expected to mean some may no longer qualify, while those with the most serious conditions may not have to be assessed again.",
      "Unemployed people in receipt of universal credit, who are actively looking for work, are also expected to see their benefit levels rise, though this is likely to be by a relatively modest amount.",
      "Cabinet Office Minister Pat McFadden told the BBC protection would \"always be there for people who need help\" - but there is concern in Labour ranks on the impact on vulnerable claimants.",
      "Does cutting benefits actually work?",
      "What are PIP disability payments and why could they change?",
      "Labour's plan for benefits throws up a bigger dilemma",
      "Speaking earlier, McFadden confirmed reassessment of conditions to qualify for benefits would be part of the announcement.",
      "He said the government did not \"believe that every time someone is signed off sick that it's a permanent condition\".",
      "\"What we won't do is sit back and relax and pretend it's a progressive thing to watch millions go onto benefits,\" he added.",
      "Cabinet ministers are meeting in Downing Street on Tuesday morning, before Work and Pensions Secretary Liz Kendall announces the welfare changes in the House of Commons around 12.30 GMT.",
      "The government is hoping to reassure some recipients of PIPs , and indeed some restless Labour MPs, that they will not lose out when the plans are unveiled.",
      "Initial reports had suggested PIP - the main disability benefit in England, Wales and Northern Ireland - would be frozen for a year. But reforms are now expected to focus on eligibility for the benefit instead, after pushback from Labour MPs.",
      "In practice, this is likely to mean that those clearly unable to work will not face further reassessments of their condition, and will keep the entirety of their payments.",
      "However, the eligibility criteria are set to be tightened for those with less severe conditions, meaning some current recipients will lose out.",
      "It is expected that unemployed people in receipt of Universal Credit, and who are actively looking for work, will see their benefit levels rise - though this is likely to be by a relatively modest amount.",
      "It is also expected that people with disabilities who try out a job will not lose their existing benefit entitlement if it goes wrong.",
      "The Times reports that sick and disabled benefit claimants will face more frequent reassessments under the reforms, but that people with \"permanent or degenerative conditions\" may never have to be reassessed.",
      "The government is still facing resistance from within its own party, with Labour peer Baroness Shami Chakrabarti telling the BBC it was \"wrong in principle\" to cut benefits from people suffering from disabilities and illnesses.",
      "Speaking to the BBC, McFadden admitted there had been \"difficult\" discussions about welfare with his party.",
      "But he said Labour had been \"elected on a platform of change\".",
      "\"And part of the change we need is a welfare state that is better suited to the 21st Century,\" he said.",
      "Chancellor Rachel Reeves is set to deliver a spring statement on 26 March against the backdrop of worsening economic forecasts, which have increased the need to find savings to allow the government to meet its self-imposed spending rules.",
      "The prime minister's policy team met Labour MPs last week to discuss savings in the range of \u00a35bn to \u00a36bn from potential welfare reforms.",
      "But Downing Street has said its overhaul is not purely driven by financial concerns.",
      "\"I think the prime minister has been clear there is both a moral and an economic case for fixing our broken social security system that's holding our people back, and our country back,\" Sir Keir Starmer's official spokesman told reporters on Monday.",
      "He added that the changes would put the welfare system \"back on a more sustainable path\".",
      "Several disability benefit claimants have told the BBC that speculation about the prospect of looming cuts has been upsetting.",
      "\"It's not a case of not wanting to [work],\" said Alison, 56, who lives with her brother in a council property in Southampton. \"I think about it all the time. Being on benefits doesn't make me feel happy.\"",
      "Speaking in the Commons on Monday, Social Security minister Sir Stephen Timms admitted speculation in the run-up to the official announcement had been a source of \"anxiety\" for claimants, adding: \"I'm sad that that's happened, and that people have been concerned.\"",
      "Claimant numbers for PIP and Universal Credit payments have increased significantly in the four years since the pandemic, with total spending on health and disability benefits forecast to rise from \u00a364.7bn in 2023-24 to \u00a3100.7bn in 2029-30.",
      "Kendall said on Monday that the government would not \"shy away from the decisions that we believe are right to give opportunities to people who can work\" but would also maintain \"security for those who can't\".",
      "She added the changes would ensure \"trust and fairness in the social security system\".",
      "The previous Conservative government had explored making it harder for younger people with mental health conditions to claim PIP.",
      "But no detailed proposals were announced ahead of the general election last July, which saw Labour return to power after 14 years out of office.",
      "The Conservatives' shadow work and pensions secretary, Helen Whately, questioned Kendall on Monday reports about unease among the Cabinet.",
      "Whately asked the minister whether there was \"collective agreement\" on the plans, with Kendall responding that the shadow secretary would have to \"show a little patience\"."

      "Panorama has heard from families and teachers about the impact on these children, who are just starting or are still in primary school.",
      "Schools say some have delayed speech and understanding of words, or have slower social or emotional development, or they lack basic skills normally picked up through play.",

      "Ministers have argued that cutting around 9,000 jobs with the shift of NHS England into the Department of Health would free up resources for frontline services, perhaps as much as \u00a3500 million a year. Having two organisations often duplicating work, they say, led to wasted time and needless costs.",

      "The government has announced NHS England will be abolished to \"cut bureaucracy\" and reform how the National Health Service is run.",
      "The changes will not impact anyone's access to the NHS - it will still be free at the point of use and cover all the services it does already.",
      "Around 9,000 administrative roles are being cut at NHS England and the Department of Health and Social Care as part of the changes - amounting to roughly half of all roles at the two organisations.",
      "As part of Your Voice Your BBC, we asked for your questions on the plans and what they could mean for you - below we have answered them for you.",
      "What does NHS England do?",
      "NHS England is the administrative body which manages how health services up and down the country are run. It is made up primarily of managers and officials, not the doctors and nurses providing care in hospitals.",
      "The government provides it with money and tells it what its priorities are for the health service - for example, that might be cutting waiting times or improving cancer survival rates.",
      "NHS England's role is to funnel the money it is given into different parts of the health service and work out how to juggle resources in order to bring about the change the government wants to see.",
      "In 2012, NHS England was given more independence by the Conservative-led government. They said doing so would prevent politicians from interfering too much in how front line services are run - but critics say that change has made it harder to carry out reform or drive improvement.",
      "Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer believes that overhauling management structures will put NHS in England \"back into democratic control\" and free up money for front-line services.",
      "NHS England is also responsible for other functions like overseeing training and collecting data, as well as managing GP services.",
      "There are separate organisations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, so these changes only impact England.",
      "Did this decision come out of the blue?",
      "Within the NHS and Westminster, the writing has been on the wall for NHS England for some months.",
      "Even in the latter years of the Tory government, health ministers expressed frustration that they were not in charge of the day-to-day running of the health service.",
      "When Labour came into power, it was clear Health Secretary Wes Streeting wanted more control of the NHS and saw a lot of duplication and bureaucracy.",
      "NHS England's chief executive Amanda Pritchard recently said she would step down at the end of the March and a number of her senior leadership team have followed suit.",
      "In that respect, it was clear there was going to be significant reform - but this is as big a change as you could possibly get at the heart of the NHS management structure.",
      "What is a 'quango' - and why do ministers think 'bureaucracy' is a problem?",
      "These are two words we have heard the government use a lot when setting out why it is scrapping NHS England and bringing the health service under closer government control.",
      "In this context, bureaucracy is a stand-in word for a system that is particularly complicated, or requires excessive amounts of administration, paperwork, regulations or layers of management.",
      "Starmer made it clear he thinks this sort of admin is getting in the way of delivering health services.",
      "We also heard him describe NHS England as the \"world's largest quango\" - a term that stands for Quasi-Autonomous Non-Governmental Organisation.",
      "Could Starmer's regulation shake-up mean a 'bonfire of the quangos'?",
      "In short, quangos are bodies like regulators and advisory groups, which are funded by taxpayers but not directly controlled by central government. They do things on behalf of the government, but are not directly controlled by ministers.",
      "They range from big organisations like NHS England, Network Rail and the Environment Agency to smaller ones like the British Film Institute and Gambling Commission.",
      "Their numbers have fallen by more than half since 2010 because David Cameron's coalition government abolished nearly 300 - but there are still more than 300 across the UK.",
      "Labour has set up more than 20 since winning the election last July, including Great British Energy and Skills England.",
      "The total budget for quangos in 2022/23 - when the latest figures were published - was \u00a3353bn.",
      "Will there be more control over decision-making and budgets locally?",
      "We do not yet know all of the detail about how health services in England will be managed in the future but it is likely that some of the responsibilities NHS England currently holds will be devolved down to regional bodies.",
      "One of the arguments being made about NHS reform is that if you move decision-making down to a local level and nearer to patients, it will be health leaders who are more attuned to the needs of patients in the area making those calls.",
      "They will know what local populations need and where the weaknesses are - and that, in theory, could improve services for patients in different parts of the country.",
      "Will this mean an increase in funding to the NHS and better access to medicines?",
      "Thursday's announcement was not about funding - that is expected in the summer.",
      "We already know NHS is getting an uplift of about 3-4% next year and we do not yet know what spending will look like beyond that.",
      "But government sources believe scrapping NHS England will save the government \u00a3500m a year.",
      "On access to medicines, it is the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence - which is separate from NHS England - which sets the guidelines on what treatments are judged affordable and cost effective.",
      "When a new drug is produced by the pharmaceutical industry, the institute will decide if the NHS can afford it and whether it is better than other drugs that are used.",

    "story": [
      "A cancer charity has said it is \"angry and frustrated\" that ministers and health officials have not approved the provision of a life-extending prostate cancer drug through the NHS in England.",
      "The drug, abiraterone, has been available in Scotland and Wales for two years for high-risk patients whose cancer has not yet spread, but not in England and Northern Ireland.",
      "In a letter to Prostate Cancer UK, seen by the BBC, Health Minister Karin Smyth said the decision by NHS England, following a lengthy review, was \"based on overall affordability\" and that \"it would not be appropriate to intervene\".",
      "The government said urgent advice had been requested on the issue.",
      "The charity said it was a \"dire and urgent situation in England\" with \"a bureaucratic blockage denying men this treatment\".",
      "A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: \"We understand the frustration and upset of some patients who cannot access this potentially life-saving treatment. Ministers have requested urgent advice on the issue.\"",
      "Although not a cure, abiraterone can help stop prostate cancer spreading to other parts of the body.",
      "In England and Northern Ireland, the drug is only approved for men with very advanced prostate cancer which has spread already.",
      "In Wales and Scotland, people with the disease that has not yet spread can also get it.",
      "Research has shown that for these earlier stage patients, the survival rate after six years is improved and that the drug halved the rate of progression of the cancer.",
      "The charity says many lives could be extended by the drug, given the findings from a trial called Stampede, published in 2022.",
      "It found improved odds of survival among men given the drug alongside usual care, and concluded that abiraterone should be considered a new standard treatment.",
      "According to figures from NHS England, each year about 8,400 patients have high-risk prostate cancer that has not yet spread.",
      "Using the Stampede assumptions, 672 of those men could die prematurely without access to abiraterone.",
      "In October 2023, BBC News spoke to Giles Turner, a retired banker living in Sussex. He was diagnosed with prostate cancer earlier that year but was told that abiraterone could not be obtained on the NHS in England.",
      "He chose to pay for treatment with the drug at \u00a3250 a month. He told us then that he felt \"very fortunate\" to be able to afford it, but outraged for others who could not.",
      "At the time, NHS England said it was reviewing the drug's use for a wider range of men.",
      "However, in December 2024 it told Prostate Cancer UK that \"it has not been possible to identify the necessary recurrent headroom in revenue budgets\".",
      "Because abiraterone is a generic drug which has gone \"off patent\" and is licensed for only one group of prostate cancer patients, there is a complicated process to get it approved for wider use.",
      "Each year, NHS England can make \"discretionary\" investment decisions with a specialist advisory group, but it has chosen not to for this drug.",
      "Smyth's letter earlier this month said the process had to look at \"the overall budget impact of introducing a new treatment based on patient volumes\", and ministers would not intervene.",
      "Mr Turner said he was \"stunned\" that nearly one-and-a-half years after the BBC report, NHS England had not caught up with NHS Scotland and NHS Wales.",
      "He has spent \u00a320,000 so far on his treatment, and said he felt it was wrong that while expensive new patented drugs treatments could be funded, abiraterone - costing the NHS \u00a377 per pack per month - could not be."

    "story": [
      "The chair of NHS England has said he does not disagree with the abolishing of the organisation - although he warns that the buck will now stop with ministers.",
      "\"There will no longer be a separate vehicle that can be pointed [at] to say that's what got it wrong,\" Richard Meddings told BBC Radio 4's The World This Weekend, in the first interview with a senior official from the organisation since it was announced it would be abolished.",
      "Earlier this week the government confirmed the administrative body would be swallowed up by the Department of Health and Social Care. It will not affect patient care in hospitals, GP practices, and other health organisations but it will change how the NHS is run.",
      "Mr Meddings, who is due to step down at the end of this month, acknowledged that ministers wanted to be involved in the running of the NHS, but argued there had been a subtle form of micromanagement.",
      "\"At times, some weeks, almost 20 new instructions, commissions coming from government and ministers into the system,\" he said.",
      "Streeting admits 'risk of disruption' in NHS overhaul",
      "He also defended the idea of quangos \u2013 the term used to describe publicly funded organisations at arm's length from the government. \"I've worked with six secretaries of state and complete changes of ministers. So there is an argument for a construct that would separate the delivery vehicle from government.\"",
      "The advantage, he said, is that \"it brings in a steady engagement from relevant expertise on a particular topic. And the difference from the political world is.... they don't all necessarily come with relevant experience to run and oversee those areas\".",
      "And he argued that NHS organisational changes can't do much to change the underlying health of the population: \"The NHS deals with whoever or whatever comes through the gates in whatever condition. And many of the conditions of poor health are driven by factors outside the NHS.\"",
      "As Mr Meddings was setting out the case for the defence, the debate about the shake-up rages on.",
      "One well-placed source argued that NHS England's leaders had the chance just after the election to re-set the relationship with government but failed to do so as \"there had been too much suspicion of politicians\".",
      "The organisation, said the source, had become a bureaucracy that was \"intellectually stagnant\" and that its position interacting with both the health service and ministers \"wasn't right\".",
      "Ministers have argued that cutting around 9,000 jobs with the shift of NHS England into the Department of Health would free up resources for frontline services, perhaps as much as \u00a3500 million a year. Having two organisations often duplicating work, they say, led to wasted time and needless costs.",
      "But one NHS source noted that the government claimed credit for the fall in the overall waiting list for planned treatment since the election and a two million year-on-year increase in the number of appointments and operations \u2013 performance delivered on NHS England's watch.",
      "The same source pointed out that \"with decrepit hospital buildings a new leadership structure won't make it any easier to carry out operations and care for patients\".",
      "These are huge structural changes for the leadership of the NHS and health administration in England. But they will take time to implement.",
      "Moving two large organisations into one and implementing 9,000 redundancies will take up a lot of management time and there are warnings of possible distraction from the day to day running of services. Patients won't see much difference for a while yet.",

      "Children should completely avoid \"slushy\" ice drinks containing glycerol, which can make them very ill, until they are at least eight years old, say researchers calling for official health advice to change.",
      "The researchers studied the cases of 21 two-to-seven-year-olds in the UK and Ireland who needed emergency treatment soon after drinking a slushy product.",
      "The brightly coloured drinks are designed to appeal to children - but most contain the naturally occurring sweetener glycerol, instead of sugar, to stop them freezing solid and give the slushy effect.",
      "Current Food Standards Agency (FSA) advice says under-fives should avoid the drinks and under-11s should have no more than one.",
      "The advice is due to concerns that if a young child drinks a slushy too quickly, glycerol intoxication could cause shock, hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar) and loss of consciousness.",
      "Arla, two, and Albie, four, both ended up in hospital after drinking slushies.",
      "All of the children in the study, published in the journal Archives of Disease in Childhood, needed accident-and-emergency (A&E) treatment after becoming acutely ill within an hour of having the drinks, mostly between 2018 and 2024.",

      "There could be a \"milder cohort\" who may not need hospital treatment but still suffer symptoms such as \"nausea and vomiting\", she added.",
      "The paediatricians behind the study - all working in the UK and Ireland - say it's difficult for parents to work out how much glycerol is contained in slushy ice drinks.",
      "Recommendations based on a child's weight are hard for parents to interpret, they say, and how quickly a slushy is drunk and whether it's taken with a meal or after exercise can also be factors in the side-effects experienced.",
      "\"Estimating a safe dose is therefore not easy,\" the researchers say, who recommend changing the advice based on a child's age instead.",
      "Dr Sally Anne Wilson, chair of the Royal College of Emergency Medicine's safer care committee, told BBC Breakfast: \"As a parent you want to make sensible decisions for what you buy your child and if you're not aware that there's glycerol in the slushie and what that can do, then you're not going to have any qualms about buying the said slushie.\"",
      "Dr Wilson said age-based advice on the drinks is difficult because there's a variation in children's weight, but added \"there's definitely an argument\" for increasing the minimum age because it would solve that problem.",
      "One reason for the recent rise in children becoming ill may be the lower sugar content of the slushies, which is attractive to parents, the study says.",
      "In countries with no sugar tax, they contain much more glucose and often no glycerol at all, the authors say.",
      "Rebecca Sudworth, director of policy at the Food Standards Agency, said it was considering the finding of the review \"carefully\".",
      "\"We continue to strongly encourage parents to follow [our] advice which is that slushie drinks should not be given to children under four years old. Retailers are also advised to make parents fully aware of this guidance.\"",

    "summary": "The debate has sparked a wider dilemma about the broader purpose of welfare",
    "story": [
      "In the next 24 hours and then over the following fortnight up until the Spring Statement, the government is going to talk a lot about a broken welfare system that is failing the people who use it, the economy and taxpayers.",
      "Taking a tough call on fixing it goes against the instincts of much of the Labour Party and has already sparked an internal backlash that could rise to ministerial level, as well as protests.",
      "The government is making two key related judgements. The first is that the country cannot afford to sustain recent ballooning increases in the health-related benefit bill and caseload, in particular for mental illness.",
      "At the same time, it will argue that a job is the best medicine.",
      "Underlying this is an assumption that a health-related benefits system that was built-up to deal with industrial injuries can't apply to the post-pandemic service economy workforce.",
      "The net result is likely to be significant changes to Personal Independence Payments, aiming to reduce eligibility for the highest levels of payments, especially among those of working age with mental illness.",
      "In addition, there will be a levelling of the generosity of the health component of Universal Credit. This will save billions of pounds, and about a billion of that will be reinvested in trying to help get those capable of part-time work some help for a partial return.",
      "Mapping welfare trends",
      "The Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) is rolling in real-time data. \"Cluster analysis maps\" reveal to ministers exactly who is claiming out of work benefits and where they are.",
      "As the numbers continue to increase, the data is being cut by sector, postcode, age and type of illness. Every pattern is being analysed.",
      "The idea was that the data would firstly offer the government insight into how it could make billions of pounds of cuts to a rapidly growing bill in order to help the Chancellor meet her self-imposed government borrowing rules.",
      "Secondly, it was meant to point to more fundamental reforms to welfare, also designed to temper the same ballooning rise in the costs of dealing with ill health among the working population.",
      "The data has thrown up answers.",
      "That poor mental health is driving the rise in claimants is clear. To a lesser extent, so too is the role that raising the state pension age has played, with many thousands who would previously have been retired now claiming health-related benefits.",
      "But it has also thrown up a major question too: does cutting welfare to incentivise people to work more hours in fact do the opposite - nudging them out of the workforce altogether and ultimately increasing the benefit bill?",
      "If this is the case - and it is by no means a universally accepted interpretation of what has happened - then the question is whether further cuts could in fact increase the numbers claiming? And should Labour instead invest in getting people back into work?",
      "Growing sickness",
      "When I visited a job centre in Birmingham alongside the Work and Pensions Secretary Liz Kendall in the Autumn, I was taken aback by how the work coaches were talking as much about health as about work.",
      "\"There's a lot of mental health, depression and anxiety,\" Qam told me.",
      "GPs have reported that their surgery time is dominated by trying to work out whether their patients are \"fit for work\". Roughly 11 million fit notes are issued every year in England alone, with 93% assessing the patient as \"not fit for work\". That has doubled over a decade. In the latest quarter, 44% were for 5 weeks or more absence.",
      "From that pool of growing in-work sickness, a significant proportion ends up on some form of incapacity benefits. The Treasury's bill for health and disability benefits, which was \u00a328bn in the year before the pandemic, is now \u00a352bn a year. It is forecast by the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) to hit \u00a370bn by the end of the decade.",
      "The pure financial aim here is to \"bend the curve\" down to nearer \u00a360bn in that period. This means restricting both the generosity and eligibility of some - or all of such - payments. It could require a wholesale cash freeze so that benefits do not rise with inflation, for example, or the abolition of entire categories of recipients.",
      "'Deaths of despair'",
      "An Institute for Fiscal Studies report published last week showed that wider measures of mental ill health have rocketed since the pandemic. Between 2002 and 2024, the number of 16-64-year-olds claiming disability benefits for mental or behavioural health conditions increased from 360,000 to 1.28 million.",
      "Every day in 2023 there were 10 extra \"deaths of despair\" (defined as deaths from alcohol, drugs or suicide) in England and Wales than the average between 2015 and 2019. Average sickness absence rates across the whole economy remained structurally higher than pre-pandemic.",
      "Of particular concern is how this affects young people. In a recent report DWP adviser Prof Paul Gregg points to the \"incredibly low\" chances of sustained returns to the workforce once a person has been on incapacity benefits for two years.",
      "About two fifths of new incapacity benefit claimants under 25 came directly from education. The latest DWP analysis shows these trends are now closely related to broader socio-economic vulnerabilities such as limited education and also with precarious sectors such as retail and hospitality.",
      "The question that remains is whether so many people really are more sick - and what role (if any) is played by the reduction in stigma around mental health.",
      "But then there is the question of how to address it.",
      "Overly binary",
      "Another major factor is that rise in the state pension age, which the DWP calculates, resulted in 89,000 older workers instead claiming health-related benefits. However, the sharp increase in claimants of such benefits since the pandemic is not only attributable to ageing populations or increasing mental health diagnoses.",
      "Research suggests there are significant systemic and policy-driven causes. At its heart the problem is perceived to be that the current welfare structure has become overly binary, failing to accommodate a growing demographic who should be able to do at least a bit of work.",
      "This rigidity - what ministers refer to as a \"hard boundary\" - inadvertently pushes individuals towards declaring complete unfitness for work, and can lead to total dependence on welfare, particularly Universal Credit Health (UC Health), rather than facilitating a gradual transition back into employment.",
      "This has been bad for the economy, for employers, terrible for the public finances, and deeply concerning for the career prospects of individuals.",
      "History helps here. Health-related benefits are often a disguised form of unemployment. The caseload for incapacity benefits (which include not just UC Health but previous incarnations) since the 1970s shows the UK heading for a record of one in 12 adults of working age in receipt.",
      "But this is not the first such build-up. It happened in the late 1980s when Margaret Thatcher was prime minister, and it was reversed in the early 2000s under New Labour.",
      "The launch in 1986 of Restart Programme, a forerunner to JobSeekers Allowance modelled on Ronald Reagan's policies in the US, helped return many claimants to the workforce but also pushed a staggering number into incapacity claims.",
      "Over the decade and a half of this policy, there was a 1.6 million increase in people in receipt of the benefit. But at the time this migration from claimant unemployment into incapacity was apparently a deliberate strategy, as it helped deal with headlines about \"three million unemployed\".",
      "A middle ground",
      "The government has not yet published its analysis on the jobs market, but Prof Gregg's early thinking was made clear in a report for the Health Foundation. He argued that, historically, the welfare system responded effectively through a middle ground that allowed individuals to combine part-time work with partial welfare benefits. He puts this down to reforms introduced in the early 2000s, such as tax credits.",
      "This is essentially the crystallisation of Iain Duncan Smith's critique of then chancellor George Osborne's welfare cuts of 2016. He told me at the time that they were \"deeply unfair\" on working people and the vision of a proper welfare-to-work scheme \"could not be repeatedly salami-sliced\".",
      "Some argue that those reforms created a situation where individuals, unable to sustain full-time work, gravitate towards more generous health-based welfare program.",
      "Crucially, claims began to rise in 2018. At the DWP ministers have tried to research the reasons behind the increase in caseload - and found that about a third of the increase can be explained as the predictable consequence of policy or of demographics.",
      "Prevention rather than cure",
      "With an ongoing flow of new claimants arriving in the system (nearly half a million in the last financial year) the onus is now on finding a prevention rather than a cure.",
      "And this is where it becomes tricky - one suggestion involves eliminating the current welfare trap by reintroducing intermediate support for part-time work. However, that requires extra funding, as well as a way of providing more personalised job searches and better mental health support.",
      "Another option is passing responsibilities to employers. In the Netherlands, employers bear significant responsibilities and financial costs if they fail to adequately support employees facing health challenges. In the early 2000s, the Dutch also had very high levels of incapacity but they now report employment rates of 83%.",
      "The structure of the jobs market in the UK makes that challenging to replicate - for example there are more insecure zero hours contracts.",
      "And given that businesses feel under pressure from National Insurance rises and a slow economy, could they really be cajoled into helping?",
      "Faster cuts",
      "The questions arising from the data will matter for the economy, for the public finances, our health, and young people's careers and livelihoods, at a time of considerable change.",
      "Fundamentally, it is a question of what the benefit system is for, at a time when illness is being redefined, and when the trends are, frankly, scary.",
      "Then there is the question of whether the public wants to pay even higher taxes in the hope of delivering long-term gain. Welfare-to-work programs can pay for themselves eventually, but the Government feels it needs to book faster cuts.",
      "That's because all of this is in the context of what \"fiscal headroom\" the government did have against the Chancellor's self-imposed borrowing targets being wiped out since the Trump shock to the world economy, the Budget and the announcements of extra European defence spending.",
      "But government insiders are at pains to argue that the primary motivation for any cuts is not regaining the extra room for manoeuvre. \"We don't need the OBR to tell us that we need to fix welfare to get people back to work. We don't need the OBR to tell us we need to make the NHS more productive. And we don't need the OBR to tell us that the taxpayer should be getting more value for money,\" a source told me.",
      "\"Headroom or no headroom the Chancellor is determined to push through the change we need to make Britain more secure and prosperous.\"",
      "Ultimately, the economic imperative is clear - to bring a cohort of young people suffering a combination of mental ill health and joblessness back into work.",
      "And the government believes there is no way of doing this without, at least at first, hurting the incomes of ill people. There is going to be quite the backlash from disability charities, and in turn from backbench Labour MPs.",
      "That's why it's no exaggeration to say this month's explosive row about welfare will come to define this Government.",

      "Liz Kendall said the changes would create \"a more proactive, pro-work system for those who can work\", while protecting those who cannot.",
      "Eligibility for disability payments will be restricted to those with the greatest need, and the test to qualify for the extra universal credit payment for health conditions will be replaced.",
      "The health-related top ups will also be frozen for current claimants and reduced for new applicants.",

      "At-a-glance: Key changes to benefits in welfare shake-up",
      "What are Pip disability payments and how are they changing?",
      "Spending on health and disability-related benefits has ballooned in recent years, and has been forecast to increase from \u00a365bn a year currently to \u00a3100bn by 2029.",
      "However, some Labour MPs and charities are worried about the potential impact of restricting benefits on vulnerable people.",
      "In response to these concerns, the government has abandoned the idea of a one-year freeze to the level of personal independence payments (Pips), which provide help with extra living costs for people who have a long-term physical or mental health condition.",
      "But Kendall said eligibility for the payment - the main disability benefit in England, Wales and Northern Ireland - would be tightened.",
      "Under the current system, applicants are scored on their ability to carry out everyday tasks, with those who score 8-11 points eligible for the standard rate and scores of 12 points and over eligible for the enhanced rate.",
      "From November 2026, there will be an extra requirement to score a minimum four points in at least one activity to qualify for the daily living element of the payment.",
      "The mobility component of Pips, for those who need help getting around, will not be affected.",
      "Kendall announced work capability assessments, which are used to determine whether someone is fit to work and if they can receive additional benefits payments because of a health condition or disability, would be scrapped in 2028.",
      "She said the assessments were \"complex, time-consuming and often stressful for claimants\", as well as being based \"on a binary can-can't work divide\".",
      "In the future, financial support for health conditions will only be available through the Pip assessment, based on the impact of someone's health condition rather than their capacity to work.",
      "Reassessments to determine whether someone is still eligible for benefits will increase, although those with the most severe conditions that will never improve will not be reassessed.",
      "In an attempt to tackle the \"financial incentive to define yourself as incapable of work\", Kendall said from April next year the extra amount of universal credit for a health condition or disability will be frozen for existing claimants until 2029/30 and cut by almost half for new claimants.",
      "There will be an additional premium for people with severe, lifelong conditions that mean they will never work.",
      "Meanwhile, there will be a permanent, above-inflation rise to the standard allowance of universal credit \u2013 equivalent to a \u00a3775 annual increase in cash terms by 2029/30.",
      "The government will also introduce a \"right to try\", to guarantee that people who try out a job will not lose their existing benefits if it does not work out.",
      "For adults under the age of 22, ministers are considering preventing access to universal credit top-up payment for health conditions, alongside more support to get people into work.",
      "'Too little, too late'",
      "Charities, trade unions and some Labour MPs were among those to condemn the cuts to benefits.",
      "The Disability Benefits Consortium, which represents more than 100 charities and organisations, said: \"These immoral and devastating benefits cuts will push more disabled people into poverty, and worsen people's health.\"",
      "The SNP said the measures  would \"harm the most vulnerable\" and \"mark the start of a new era of austerity cuts\".",
      "Debbie Abrahams, the Labour MP who chairs the Commons work and pensions committee, argued there were \"more compassionate ways to balance the books rather than on the back of sick and disabled people\".",
      "However, the Conservatives said the changes were \"too little, too late\" and needed to be \"tougher\".",
      "Shadow work and pensions secretary Helen Whately asked why the government was only planning to save \u00a35bn annually, when the total bill for health and disability benefits is forecast to rise to more than \u00a3100bn a year by 2029/30.",
      "Liberal Democrat work and pensions spokesman Steve Darling said: \"If the government was serious about cutting welfare spending it would get serious about fixing health and social care and the broken Department of Work and Pensions.\"",
      "Some of the changes will require new legislation, raising the prospect of a rebellion by some Labour MPs during votes in Parliament.",

    "published": "Mon, 17 Mar 2025 06:06:29 GMT",
    "summary": "The debate has sparked a wider dilemma about the broader purpose of welfare",
    "story": [
      "In the next 24 hours and then over the following fortnight up until the Spring Statement, the government is going to talk a lot about a broken welfare system that is failing the people who use it, the economy and taxpayers.",
      "Taking a tough call on fixing it goes against the instincts of much of the Labour Party and has already sparked an internal backlash that could rise to ministerial level, as well as protests.",
      "The government is making two key related judgements. The first is that the country cannot afford to sustain recent ballooning increases in the health-related benefit bill and caseload, in particular for mental illness.",
      "At the same time, it will argue that a job is the best medicine.",
      "Underlying this is an assumption that a health-related benefits system that was built-up to deal with industrial injuries can't apply to the post-pandemic service economy workforce.",
      "The net result is likely to be significant changes to Personal Independence Payments, aiming to reduce eligibility for the highest levels of payments, especially among those of working age with mental illness.",
      "In addition, there will be a levelling of the generosity of the health component of Universal Credit. This will save billions of pounds, and about a billion of that will be reinvested in trying to help get those capable of part-time work some help for a partial return.",
      "Mapping welfare trends",
      "The Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) is rolling in real-time data. \"Cluster analysis maps\" reveal to ministers exactly who is claiming out of work benefits and where they are.",
      "As the numbers continue to increase, the data is being cut by sector, postcode, age and type of illness. Every pattern is being analysed.",
      "The idea was that the data would firstly offer the government insight into how it could make billions of pounds of cuts to a rapidly growing bill in order to help the Chancellor meet her self-imposed government borrowing rules.",
      "Secondly, it was meant to point to more fundamental reforms to welfare, also designed to temper the same ballooning rise in the costs of dealing with ill health among the working population.",
      "The data has thrown up answers.",
      "That poor mental health is driving the rise in claimants is clear. To a lesser extent, so too is the role that raising the state pension age has played, with many thousands who would previously have been retired now claiming health-related benefits.",
      "But it has also thrown up a major question too: does cutting welfare to incentivise people to work more hours in fact do the opposite - nudging them out of the workforce altogether and ultimately increasing the benefit bill?",
      "If this is the case - and it is by no means a universally accepted interpretation of what has happened - then the question is whether further cuts could in fact increase the numbers claiming? And should Labour instead invest in getting people back into work?",
      "Growing sickness",
      "When I visited a job centre in Birmingham alongside the Work and Pensions Secretary Liz Kendall in the Autumn, I was taken aback by how the work coaches were talking as much about health as about work.",
      "\"There's a lot of mental health, depression and anxiety,\" Qam told me.",
      "GPs have reported that their surgery time is dominated by trying to work out whether their patients are \"fit for work\". Roughly 11 million fit notes are issued every year in England alone, with 93% assessing the patient as \"not fit for work\". That has doubled over a decade. In the latest quarter, 44% were for 5 weeks or more absence.",
      "From that pool of growing in-work sickness, a significant proportion ends up on some form of incapacity benefits. The Treasury's bill for health and disability benefits, which was \u00a328bn in the year before the pandemic, is now \u00a352bn a year. It is forecast by the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) to hit \u00a370bn by the end of the decade.",
      "The pure financial aim here is to \"bend the curve\" down to nearer \u00a360bn in that period. This means restricting both the generosity and eligibility of some - or all of such - payments. It could require a wholesale cash freeze so that benefits do not rise with inflation, for example, or the abolition of entire categories of recipients.",
      "'Deaths of despair'",
      "An Institute for Fiscal Studies report published last week showed that wider measures of mental ill health have rocketed since the pandemic. Between 2002 and 2024, the number of 16-64-year-olds claiming disability benefits for mental or behavioural health conditions increased from 360,000 to 1.28 million.",
      "Every day in 2023 there were 10 extra \"deaths of despair\" (defined as deaths from alcohol, drugs or suicide) in England and Wales than the average between 2015 and 2019. Average sickness absence rates across the whole economy remained structurally higher than pre-pandemic.",
      "Of particular concern is how this affects young people. In a recent report DWP adviser Prof Paul Gregg points to the \"incredibly low\" chances of sustained returns to the workforce once a person has been on incapacity benefits for two years.",
      "About two fifths of new incapacity benefit claimants under 25 came directly from education. The latest DWP analysis shows these trends are now closely related to broader socio-economic vulnerabilities such as limited education and also with precarious sectors such as retail and hospitality.",
      "The question that remains is whether so many people really are more sick - and what role (if any) is played by the reduction in stigma around mental health.",
      "But then there is the question of how to address it.",
      "Overly binary",
      "Another major factor is that rise in the state pension age, which the DWP calculates, resulted in 89,000 older workers instead claiming health-related benefits. However, the sharp increase in claimants of such benefits since the pandemic is not only attributable to ageing populations or increasing mental health diagnoses.",
      "Research suggests there are significant systemic and policy-driven causes. At its heart the problem is perceived to be that the current welfare structure has become overly binary, failing to accommodate a growing demographic who should be able to do at least a bit of work.",
      "This rigidity - what ministers refer to as a \"hard boundary\" - inadvertently pushes individuals towards declaring complete unfitness for work, and can lead to total dependence on welfare, particularly Universal Credit Health (UC Health), rather than facilitating a gradual transition back into employment.",
      "This has been bad for the economy, for employers, terrible for the public finances, and deeply concerning for the career prospects of individuals.",
      "History helps here. Health-related benefits are often a disguised form of unemployment. The caseload for incapacity benefits (which include not just UC Health but previous incarnations) since the 1970s shows the UK heading for a record of one in 12 adults of working age in receipt.",
      "But this is not the first such build-up. It happened in the late 1980s when Margaret Thatcher was prime minister, and it was reversed in the early 2000s under New Labour.",
      "The launch in 1986 of Restart Programme, a forerunner to JobSeekers Allowance modelled on Ronald Reagan's policies in the US, helped return many claimants to the workforce but also pushed a staggering number into incapacity claims.",
      "Over the decade and a half of this policy, there was a 1.6 million increase in people in receipt of the benefit. But at the time this migration from claimant unemployment into incapacity was apparently a deliberate strategy, as it helped deal with headlines about \"three million unemployed\".",
      "A middle ground",
      "The government has not yet published its analysis on the jobs market, but Prof Gregg's early thinking was made clear in a report for the Health Foundation. He argued that, historically, the welfare system responded effectively through a middle ground that allowed individuals to combine part-time work with partial welfare benefits. He puts this down to reforms introduced in the early 2000s, such as tax credits.",
      "This is essentially the crystallisation of Iain Duncan Smith's critique of then chancellor George Osborne's welfare cuts of 2016. He told me at the time that they were \"deeply unfair\" on working people and the vision of a proper welfare-to-work scheme \"could not be repeatedly salami-sliced\".",
      "Some argue that those reforms created a situation where individuals, unable to sustain full-time work, gravitate towards more generous health-based welfare program.",
      "Crucially, claims began to rise in 2018. At the DWP ministers have tried to research the reasons behind the increase in caseload - and found that about a third of the increase can be explained as the predictable consequence of policy or of demographics.",
      "Prevention rather than cure",
      "With an ongoing flow of new claimants arriving in the system (nearly half a million in the last financial year) the onus is now on finding a prevention rather than a cure.",
      "And this is where it becomes tricky - one suggestion involves eliminating the current welfare trap by reintroducing intermediate support for part-time work. However, that requires extra funding, as well as a way of providing more personalised job searches and better mental health support.",
      "Another option is passing responsibilities to employers. In the Netherlands, employers bear significant responsibilities and financial costs if they fail to adequately support employees facing health challenges. In the early 2000s, the Dutch also had very high levels of incapacity but they now report employment rates of 83%.",
      "The structure of the jobs market in the UK makes that challenging to replicate - for example there are more insecure zero hours contracts.",
      "And given that businesses feel under pressure from National Insurance rises and a slow economy, could they really be cajoled into helping?",
      "Faster cuts",
      "The questions arising from the data will matter for the economy, for the public finances, our health, and young people's careers and livelihoods, at a time of considerable change.",
      "Fundamentally, it is a question of what the benefit system is for, at a time when illness is being redefined, and when the trends are, frankly, scary.",
      "Then there is the question of whether the public wants to pay even higher taxes in the hope of delivering long-term gain. Welfare-to-work programs can pay for themselves eventually, but the Government feels it needs to book faster cuts.",
      "That's because all of this is in the context of what \"fiscal headroom\" the government did have against the Chancellor's self-imposed borrowing targets being wiped out since the Trump shock to the world economy, the Budget and the announcements of extra European defence spending.",
      "But government insiders are at pains to argue that the primary motivation for any cuts is not regaining the extra room for manoeuvre. \"We don't need the OBR to tell us that we need to fix welfare to get people back to work. We don't need the OBR to tell us we need to make the NHS more productive. And we don't need the OBR to tell us that the taxpayer should be getting more value for money,\" a source told me.",
      "\"Headroom or no headroom the Chancellor is determined to push through the change we need to make Britain more secure and prosperous.\"",
      "Ultimately, the economic imperative is clear - to bring a cohort of young people suffering a combination of mental ill health and joblessness back into work.",
      "And the government believes there is no way of doing this without, at least at first, hurting the incomes of ill people. There is going to be quite the backlash from disability charities, and in turn from backbench Labour MPs.",

      "Rachel Reeves met industry watchdogs on Monday, revealing plans to cut the cost of regulation, including on environmental measures, and axe some bodies entirely.",
      "It comes as a leading think tank cut its UK growth forecasts for 2025 and 2026 as it downgraded prospects for the global economy over trade war concerns.",
      "The government has made boosting growth its main priority, but the Conservatives said Labour's taxes were harming growth and called on Reeves to set out a \"real plan\".",
      "Reeves told regulators at the 40-minute meeting that the current level of bureaucracy made it \"too slow to get things done\".",
      "\"There are a number of things over the last decade or so that have held back growth, and one of them - if we are honest and you know better than anyone - is the regulatory landscape,\" she said.",
      "Reeves also spoke about reducing the duplication of work done by regulators.",
      "'Global headwinds'",
      "In its latest forecast, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development's (OECD) cut its predictions for UK growth to 1.4% in 2025, from its previous forecast of 1.7%, and to 1.2% in 2026, down from 1.3%.",
      "However, the forecast is more optimistic than the Bank of England, which earlier this month cut its UK growth forecast for 2025 to 0.75%.",
      "Economic forecasts are not always accurate but predictions from the OECD are looked at closely.",
      "The OECD said that for the world economy, growth would slow from 3.2% in 2024 to 3.1% in 2025, largely as a result of the trade tensions sparked by US President Donald Trump's introduction of tariffs on imports into the US.",
      "In response to the OECD's forecast, Reeves said: \"This report shows the world is changing, and increased global headwinds such as trade uncertainty are being felt across the board.\"",
      "The UK economy shrank unexpectedly in January, contracting by 0.1%, which was weaker than forecast, driven mainly by a decline in the manufacturing sector.",
      "Ahead of Monday's meeting with regulators, Reeves said. \"By cutting red tape and creating a more effective system, we will boost investment, create jobs and put more money into working people's pockets.\"",
      "Changes announced by the government include streamlining the environmental regulatory process for major projects including Lower Thames Crossing (subject to planning approval) and future ones such as a Heathrow expansion.",
      "Meanwhile, environmental guidance, including hundreds of pages on protection of bats, will be reviewed, while environmental permits for some low-risk and temporary projects will be removed.",
      "This plan comes alongside 60 measures agreed upon by watchdogs \"following weeks of intense negotiations\" that are designed to make it easier to do business in the UK.",
      "Those measures include:",
      "Fast-tracking new medicines through a pilot to provide parallel authorisations from healthcare regulatorsReviewing the \u00a3100 cap on individual contactless paymentsSimplifying mortgage lending rules to make it easier to re-mortgage with a new lender and reduce mortgage termsSetting up a 'concierge service' to help international financial services firms navigate regulationsCivil Aviation Authority permitting at least two more large drone-flying trials for deliveries in the coming months - which the government said has already cut travel times for blood samples between hospitals from 30 minutes down to two minutes",

      "The government has pledged to build 1.5 million homes over the next five years.",
      "He has used the example of Ebbsfleet in Kent, where he said the \"dream of home ownership for thousands of families\" had been \"held back by arachnids\".",
      "A rare species of spider known as the \"distinguished jumping spider\" was found in the area, which was given environmental protections to restrict building.",
      "Those protections meant 1,300 homes could not be built.",
      "But more than 4,000 homes have been built in other parts of Ebbsfleet and thousands more are planned.",
      "Kent Wildlife Trust has accused Sir Keir of an \"oversimplification\" and said he has \"misrepresented this complex issue\".",
      "The charity is planning to write directly to the prime minister, along with other conservation groups, to complain.",
      "Ebbsfleet Garden City has been under development since 2015 and is being built across 2,500 acres of brownfield land in the Thames Estuary.",
      "Writing in the Daily Telegraph on Thursday, Sir Keir said the project was to \"build more than 15,000 new homes\" with a \"17-minute commute into central London\".",
      "He wrote that the previous government had bought 125 hectares of former industrial land and quarries to build homes on, but the plan had been \"blocked by Natural England\" due to \"the discovery of a colony of 'distinguished jumping spiders'\".",
      "He added: \"It's nonsense. And we'll stop it.\"",
      "In a speech in Hull later the same day, Sir Keir appeared to refer to Ebbsfleet again, saying that \"jumping spiders\" had stopped \"an entire new town\".",
      "He added: \"I've not made that example up, it's where we've got to.\"",
      "Conservation charities say that characterisation is wrong.",
      "Natural England declared the Swanscombe Pensinsula, where around 1,300 of Ebbsfleet's homes were planned, as a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) in March 2021.",
      "It is one of just two sites in the UK which are home to the distinguished jumping spider.",
      "The tiny creatures are just millimetres in size and thrive in rubble and post-industrial environments .",
      "It is understood Sir Keir was using the example to make a broad point but conservation charities have expressed disappointment at his apparent lack of accuracy.",
      "Jamie Robins, from the charity Bugslife, said: \"Making false claims about critically endangered jumping spiders stopping 'an entire new town' is misleading and incorrect.\"",
      "He said it \"undermines public confidence in the vital protections and binding commitments that we have for nature and the role of Natural England in helping it to thrive\".",
      "Emma Waller, from Kent Wildlife Trust, said: \"All of the SSSI, including where the 1,300 [homes] were planned, are vital habitats that we simply cannot afford to lose.\"",

    "summary": "The government is identifying cuts to the welfare budget ahead of the Spring Statement, with the PM working to rally MPs to support the move.",
    "story": [
      "Sir Keir Starmer has been urged to protect disabled people claiming welfare payments from expected cuts to the benefits system.",
      "The health and disability-related benefits bill is now \u00a365bn a year and projected to increase to \u00a3100bn over the next four years, with research suggesting rising levels of mental ill health are behind the figures.",
      "The government is identifying cuts to the welfare budget ahead of the Spring Statement, with the PM working to rally MPs to support the move.",
      "Sir Keir was challenged at PMQs by Lib Dem leader Sir Ed Davey and Labour's Richard Burgon, who said disabled people were \"frightened\" and suggested \"the moral thing to do\" would be to introduce a wealth tax.",
      "Starmer says benefit system unfair and indefensible",
      "Work coaches to focus on long-term unemployed",
      "How big is the welfare budget and where might cuts fall?",
      "Expected cuts could fall on Personal Independent Payments (PIP), which provides help with extra living costs to those with a long-term physical or mental health condition, and cuts to incapacity benefits for people unable to work and receiving Universal Credit (UC).",
      "Speaking at PMQs, Sir Ed asked the prime minister to confirm that disability benefits for people who cannot work would not be cut.",
      "Sir Keir said: \"We will of course support those who need support, but help those who can work into work. They'll be the guiding principles.\"",
      "Later, Labour MP Burgon said that when disabled people \"hear the language of tough choices... it means the easy option of of making the poor and vulnerable people pay\", and said the \"courageous\" thing to do would be to introduce a wealth tax.",
      "Sir Keir responded that the Conservatives had \"locked millions out of work\" and there was \"a moral imperative\" to \"help those who want to work to get back into work\".",
      "On a wealth tax, he added: \"We have raised money, the energy profits levy, taxing non-doms, and air passenger duty on private jets, but this isn't a bottomless pit and must kickstart growth to get the economic stability that we need.\"",
      "Labour MPs have been called in to 10 Downing Street to discuss the changes,",
      "Bassetlaw MP Jo White, who represents the so-called Red Wall MPs, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme there was \"a moral duty to change people's lives\".",
      "\"It's a generational thing \u2013 if families are out of work they tend to bring up their children to exist on the benefits system,\" she said.",
      "\"People slide along on that low level of income, perhaps dipping into the black market, but their aspirations are so low and the communities do not change.\"",
      "Tackling this issue through changing the welfare system \"is absolutely critical\", White argued, because in order to \" lift people out of poverty... they need to be in work\".",
      "But significant numbers of Labour colleagues are unhappy. Nottingham East MP Nadia Whittome told the BBC her party was \"getting it badly wrong on this\".",
      "\"We cannot go back\" to the \"narrative of strivers versus skivers\", she said.",
      "Asked if she would rebel over the issue, Whittome said: \"I was on these benefits - my mum had to stop work when I was a teenager to care for me.",
      "\"I represent disabled people, all of us do, and we all hear their stories every day and just how scared they are about this and what a difference these payments make to their lives.",
      "\"I can't look my constituents in the eye, I can't look my mum in the eye, and support this.\"",
      "Many Labour MPs who spoke to the BBC have said they agreed many people currently on disability benefits could work and should.",
      "But they worried the government's rumoured plans, such as freezing Personal Independence Payments, would punish all those on disability benefits, including those with severe disabilities who could never work.",
      "That would be \"unforgivable\", one MP told the BBC.",
      "Another said making it more difficult to access disability payments was \"not what the Labour party ought to be about\".",
      "\"It's our very DNA that Labour was created to lift people out of difficult circumstances,\" they said.",
      "\"The government needs to stop talking about everyone who is on disability benefits as if they are all the same because they are not,\" said another.",
      "In the UK 1.3m people now claim disability benefits primarily for mental health or behavioural conditions \u2013 44% of all claimants, the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) found.",
      "Exploring the reasons behind the rise, which has \"accelerated\" since the pandemic,  researchers said the UK was an outlier compared to other countries, none of which have seen the same level of post-pandemic increases in health-related benefit claims.",
      "More than half of the rise in 16 to 64-year-olds claiming disability benefits since the pandemic is for claims relating to mental health or behavioural conditions, according to a report from the IFS.",
      "Researchers found particularly fast growth in new disability benefit claims for learning disability and autism spectrum claims.",
      "There was also evidence of increasing levels of severe mental health problems.",
      "There is a heightened rate of mortality among working age people, due to \"deaths of despair\"- either by suicide, alcohol or drug misuse - and such deaths are much more likely if someone has a mental health illness.",
      "Trades Union Congress (TUC) general secretary Paul Nowak said slashing welfare for disabled people would \"only make the current challenges worse\".",
      "He urged Labour not to cut PIP, which he said enables many disabled people to access work rather than relying on benefits, but he backed reforms to a \"one-size-fits all approach\" towards one that provides tailored employment support.",
      "\"Trade unions share the government's ambitions to improve the nation's health and to help more people into good quality work,\" he said.",
      "\"A major lesson from the Tory years is that austerity damaged the nation's health - we must not make the same mistake again.\"",

      "There are two elements - a daily living component and a mobility component. Claimants may be eligible for one or both.",
      "Daily living covers areas such as requiring help with preparing food, washing, reading and managing your money. The mobility element includes physically moving around or getting out of your home.",
      "Applicants are scored on a points system based on their ability to carry out everyday tasks and on their mobility. Those who score 8-11 points in total receive the standard rate of Pip, and those who score 12 points and over are eligible for the enhanced rate.",
      "From November 2026, the government says applicants will need to score at least four points in one activity to receive the daily living component of Pip.",
      "Eligibility for mobility payments will not be affected.",
      "The payments for daily living are:",
      "A standard rate of \u00a372.65 per weekAn enhanced rate of \u00a3108.55 per week",
      "A standard rate of \u00a372.65 per week",
      "An enhanced rate of \u00a3108.55 per week",
      "For mobility the payments are:",
      "A standard rate of \u00a328.70 per weekAn enhanced rate of \u00a375.75 per week",
      "A standard rate of \u00a328.70 per week",
      "An enhanced rate of \u00a375.75 per week",
      "Pip is usually paid every four weeks and is tax-free. It does not change depending on your savings or income and does not count as income affecting other benefits, or the benefit cap. You can get Pip if you are working.",
      "At present, the payment is made for a fixed period of time between one and 10 years, after which it is reviewed. A reassessment could come earlier if your circumstances change.",
      "Under the changes announced by the government, there will be more frequent reassessments for many people claiming Pip. Many recipients could be affected.",
      "However, those with the highest levels of a permanent condition or disability will no longer face reassessment.",
      "Initially, it was thought Pip payments might not be increased in line with inflation for a year, but the government has said they will not be frozen or means tested.",
      "Pip is paid in England, Wales and Northern Ireland.",
      "There is a similar but separate benefit in Scotland called the Adult Disability Payment.",
      "How big is the welfare budget and where might cuts fall?",
      "Labour's plan for benefits throws up a bigger dilemma",
      "Does cutting benefits actually work?",
      "How is universal credit changing?",
      "The government has also made changes to universal credit, which is currently paid to 7.5 million people.",
      "At present, more than three million recipients have no requirement to find work, a number that has risen sharply.",
      "The basic level of universal credit is worth \u00a3393.45 a month to a single person who is 25 or over.",
      "But if you have limited capacity to work because of a disability or long term condition, this payment more than doubles, due to a top up of \u00a3416.19.",
      "Under the proposals, claimants will not be eligible to get this incapacity top-up until they are aged 22 or over.",
      "There will also be an \"expectation to engage\" for those who receive the extra money, involving personalised employment support.",
      "At the same time, the basic payment level will rise, reaching a \u00a3775 annual increase by the year 2029-30.",
      "Why is the government aiming to cut welfare spending?",
      "Overall, the government currently spends \u00a365bn a year on health and disability-related benefits. This is projected to increase to \u00a3100bn by 2029.",
      "Pip is now the second-largest element of the working-age welfare bill, with spending expected to almost double to \u00a334bn by 2029-30.",
      "When Pip was introduced in 2013, the aim was to save \u00a31.4bn a year by reducing the number of people eligible for payments. However, initial savings were modest and the number of claimants has risen.",
      "About 1.3m people now claim disability benefits primarily for mental health or behavioural conditions such as ADHD.",
      "That is 44% of all working age claimants, according to the independent economic think-tank, the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS)."

    "published": "Sat, 15 Mar 2025 13:05:44 GMT",
    "summary": "Labour may have ditched its factional in-fighting - but deep welfare cuts could reignite tensions.",
    "story": [
      "The prime minister has just had another moment at the lectern, urging Europe to stand up for Ukraine. He's an increasingly confident leader, but in the coming days No 10 faces what could be a defining fight at home.",
      "\"There is a collision coming,\" a Labour insider tells me. Sir Keir Starmer has long been up for fights with his party. But with controversy around every corner, who are the tribes in the party in 2025, and might they fight back?",
      "The party's history is crammed with bitter bust-ups, years when MPs seemed most comfortable to be fighting each other, rather than political rivals.",
      "With a squeeze on benefits coming, there is unease on the back, and the front benches, including in cabinet. The decision on winter fuel payments still causes resentment, and new plans for immigration coming in a white paper later in the spring are likely to be controversial too.",
      "A long-time party observer says: \"Put three Labour people in a room and you'll have a faction.\"",
      "Sir Keir's allies seem pretty confident Labour's ditched that habit of constant scrapping. But No 10 is worried enough to be inviting MPs into Downing Street to make their pitch for the changes to welfare, knowing there'll be upset from the usual suspects and hoping there won't be too much of a backlash on the soft left.",
      "It's also grappling with the massive group of MPs elected last year, with some eager backbenchers actively trying to make Sir Keir's case, unkindly branded by one source as \"toadies\" trying to suck up to the leadership.",
      "So how will the \"usual suspects\", the \"softies\", the \"newbies\" and the \"toadies\" shake down?",
      "There has always been criticism of Sir Keir from the left-hand edge of Labour, not least because he spent the first couple of years in charge squeezing out the hard left, and even kicked out some MPs after the general election for voting against him over the cap on benefits for families with more than two children.",
      "It's common for MPs like Diane Abbott or Nadia Whittome to take pot shots at the prime minister's plans. But now this group is much smaller and less influential than it once was, it can't do much damage on its own. Gone are the days when the Socialist Campaign Group held sway with Jeremy Corbyn \u2013 there are only around 30 MPs in the group these days. But unhappiness about the coming welfare cuts spreads its tentacles far further.",
      "One of those arguing against them told me the vast majority of Labour MPs were in the \"group of resistance\" \u2013 and \"privately some of the cabinet are very against it.\"",
      "There is a whiff of opportunity to force Sir Keir to back down, some believe. \"There is a chance that the old left and the soft left come together,\" another MP tells me.",
      "A source on the left of the party tells me there's \"potential to broaden this out and team up with people who don't want to see benefits cut after 15 years of austerity. The challenge for us on the left is to work with those people - then we'll have a sizeable rebellion.\" It is \"breathtaking\" to see new MPs backing undisclosed changes to benefits for disabled people, they add.",
      "They point to the rebellion against Tony Blair in 1997 when 47 Labour MPs voted against the new government over - you guessed it - cuts to benefits. One hundred MPs abstained. It didn't change the policy, just as a rebellion of that kind of size wouldn't change it this time either, given the PM's huge majority. But it shocked ministers, still in the pomp of their massive victory that year. Could this do the same?",
      "Downing Street evidently is worried - but the resistance on the soft left so far seems, well, rather soft.",
      "Another source tells me there are lots of colleagues who are expressing discomfort, and there are fault-lines, but it's not organised. Some of those who would rather like there to be a rebellion seem to also rather like the idea of someone else organising it.",
      "Rebellions do need organising, effort, energy, and an eagerness to make sparks fly. They also need leaders willing to put their head above the parapet. While the concern is strong, the appetite for a big spat when the plans eventually get to Parliament is less so, at least for now.",
      "It's symbolic of where power is held in the party right now. \"The soft left has been obliterated,\" a senior Labour figure tells me, adding: \"I'm not sure No 10 has the story right and I fear it will be handled badly, but on welfare \u2013 they have got no choice.\"",
      "Ministers are trying to make a moral argument - that sorting out welfare is a mission, that it's better for people's well-being and health to have a job. Wes Streeting, the health secretary, will almost inevitably make that case when he joins us in the studio tomorrow. That argument was made by Labour in the election and in its manifesto. But the second part of the expected plans - squeezing payments to disabled people who may already be struggling - was not.",
      "None of the hordes of Labour MPs elected for the first time in 2024 had taking cash from the worst off on their campaign leaflets or Facebook posts. But are the newbies, barely a year into the job, the kind of tribe to cause trouble? Of course, it's important to note they don't all think the same but talking to some of them, there are some characteristics you can trace.",
      "Remember more than half of Labour's MPs \u2013 243 out of 406 \u2013 are completely new, so understanding their centre of gravity is hugely important. And it seems very different to the previous generations.",
      "One of the newbies told me: \"Even more than the welfare stuff, the moment that was most revealing about how different we are to 1997 was the 3% defence target and the aid cuts.\" This wasn't met with any more resistance than the resignation of International Development Minister Annaliese Dodds and a \"few rumblings\" from inside the party - but for most of the 2024 intake it was a \"no-brainer\", given the need to spend more on defence as the world becomes less secure.",
      "It's not just that Labour's recruits are different, but they note their political upbringing is different too: \"We have come of age politically in a time when chaos is the norm and the world feels like it is continually going to hell\" \u2013 so cutting aid and other policies that are uncomfortable for moderates a generation above \"are not that troubling\".",
      "Indeed, some of the newbies have been unkindly branded \"toadies\" by others, as another source describes them - not just accepting some of the leadership's tougher plans, but even egging them on, busy writing public letters, or giving supportive interviews.",
      "Whether on welfare, defence or planning, another MP describes them as \"pop-up pressure groups\", publicly calling for No 10 to push its reforms harder, and further.",
      "\"Aren't they hilarious?\" a party veteran jokes, gently mocking the ambition of those involved, suspicious that the leadership may have gently encouraged a few aspirant MPs to make their case vigorously and loudly.",
      "A government source acknowledges there is a significant chunk of MPs who want to be helpful to the leadership, but with many in marginal seats, \"they are not swots, they are street fighters\" who are closer to their voters' concerns. They're telling the leadership they can give them space to be more radical on welfare, immigration or getting houses built.",
      "For now, whatever the motivation of the usual suspects, No 10 can enjoy a level of unity in the governing party.",
      "It's also plain that the political operation in government has improved since the summer, in part due to his chief of staff, Morgan McSweeney, credited by many for bringing a new discipline to the party. \"There is only one tribe,\" a senior figure told me, \"it's Morgan McSweeney's \u2013 it's his way or the high way \u2013 his people are controlling things at the moment.\" That's described differently by others, who say: \"It's Keir's party now.\" And an increasingly confident prime minister abroad has more clout at home.",
      "But the rows over welfare that will bubble up this week and the chancellor's decisions in the Spring Statement next week still certainly matter. Not every MP or activist agrees with the decisions being taken by the centre - but with a whopping majority, the risk is not about losing votes.",
      "It's about a direction of travel and the perception of the party to the public. It matters in the next few weeks on the inside of government because managing unhappiness takes up political time, energy and effort. It matters outside because rows over policy, whether welfare or immigration, create headlines, and headaches, and the danger of giving the public the impression that the party in charge is not pulling together.",
      "That's acknowledged by a government source observing the journey Sir Keir's Labour Party has been on: \"We were united against the hard left, then we were united against the Tories\" - but as the government settles in, it's less clear what the party is united on now.",

    "summary": "The government is to set out details of how it will save billions of pounds from the working welfare bill.",
    "story": [
      "Work and Pensions Secretary Liz Kendall is set to unveil details of how the government plans to cut billions of pounds from the working-age welfare bill.",
      "The focus will be on reducing spending on health-related and disability benefits.",
      "That bill is rising rapidly and many argue it needs to be curbed for the sake of the UK's public finances \u2013 as well as the economic and individual benefits of getting people back into work.",
      "But this is not the first government to seek savings from the welfare budget, and to try to encourage more people into employment.",
      "And charities are warning about the adverse impact on vulnerable recipients.",
      "There are three broad approaches which the government is believed to be examining:",
      "Cutting the level of benefit paymentsTightening the eligibility for benefitsAttempting to get people off benefits and into work",
      "Cutting the level of benefit payments",
      "Tightening the eligibility for benefits",
      "Attempting to get people off benefits and into work",
      "BBC Verify has examined the past 15 years of policies in this area to see what might be effective \u2013 and what risks being counterproductive.",
      "Cutting payments",
      "The working-age health and disability benefits bill has certainly been increasing in recent years, and is rising rapidly.",
      "The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), the official forecaster, has projected that total state spending on these benefits for people in the UK aged between 18 and 64 will increase from \u00a348.5bn in 2023-24 to \u00a375.7bn in 2029-30.",
      "That would represent an increase from 1.7% of the size of the UK economy to 2.2%.",
      "By 2030, around half of the expenditure is projected to be on incapacity benefit, which is designed to provide additional income for people whose health limits their ability to work.",
      "The other half is projected to be on Personal Independence Payments (PIP), which are intended to help people of working age with disabilities manage the additional day-to-day costs arising from their disability.",
      "One straightforward way for ministers to curb this projected rise would be to hold payments flat in cash terms, rather than allowing them to rise in line with prices each year.",
      "\"Reducing award amounts is the easiest way to get savings in the short term,\" says Eduin Latimer of the Institute for Fiscal Studies.",
      "Freezing incapacity benefits in cash terms until 2030 would save \u00a31bn a year, according to the Resolution Foundation.",
      "But you can only receive incapacity benefit if your income and savings are below a certain level, so freezing payments would impact people who are worse off.",
      "Also, people on disability benefits such as PIP are considerably more likely to be in poverty and material deprivation.",
      "Under previous governments between 2014 and 2020, most working-age benefits did not rise in line with inflation - to save money.",
      "And from 2015, more and more people claimed incapacity benefit.",
      "So cutting the value of individual payments might save some money up front, but still not have a dramatic impact on the overall bill in the longer term if claimants continue to rise.",
      "Tighten eligibility",
      "Rather than cutting the value of these benefits for all recipients, the government could seek to save money by making it harder for people to claim them in the first place.",
      "For instance, the previous government had proposed making it harder for people with mental health conditions to claim PIP, arguing that the monthly payment was not proportionate to the additional financial needs created by their conditions.",
      "But it is important to note that efforts to change the eligibility criteria for these benefits over the past 15 years have not yielded the results hoped for.",
      "PIP was introduced in 2013 to replace the old Disability Living Allowance, with the intention it would lead to savings of \u00a31.4bn a year relative to the previous system by reducing the number of people eligible.",
      "PIP was initially projected to reduce the number of claimants by 606,000 (28%) in total.",
      "Yet the reform ended up saving only \u00a3100m a year by 2015 and the number of claimants rose by 100,000 (5%).",
      "Another attempt in 2017 to limit access to PIP was also reversed.",
      "The reason was that many people appealed against refusals that had been triggered by the tightened eligibility criteria. Also, the emergence of cases in the media which seemed unfair meant ministers, often under pressure from their own backbench MPs, ultimately ordered the eligibility rules to be relaxed.",
      "Official decisions not to award PIP and incapacity benefit to claimants are still often challenged and around two-thirds are ultimately decided in the challenger's favour at an independent tribunal.",
      "\"Britain's chequered history of benefit reform shows that the government should proceed cautiously, rather than rush ahead to find savings which could backfire,\" says Louise Murphy of the Resolution Foundation.",
      "Encourage work",
      "Another way for the government to try to achieve savings is by encouraging more people to come off these benefits and enter work.",
      "Around 93% of incapacity benefit claimants are not in work and the same is true of 80% of PIP claimants.",
      "One potential route to increase employment rates could be regular reassessments of people in receipt of incapacity benefit and a requirement for them to start looking for jobs if they are found to be fit for work.",
      "The fall in the number of people claiming incapacity benefit in the early 2010s has been attributed by the OBR to reassessments of a large number of people in receipt of an older form of the benefit.",
      "However, an aggressive or onerous reassessment regime could risk imposing distress on people who are unable to work and could also create unexpected distortions in the system.",
      "The OBR has suggested the sanctions introduced to the wider benefits system by the last government, requiring people judged fit to work to be actively looking for employment or risk losing their benefits, had the counterproductive effect of increasing the incentive for people to try to claim incapacity benefits (for which these work-searching requirements did not apply).",
      "Another potential policy avenue to boost employment rates is through providing much greater support to find jobs.",
      "Some advocate increasing government investment in official schemes, working with employers, to help people to enter the workplace.",
      "There have been various schemes designed to achieve this over the past 15 years, though they have not been on a large scale.",
      "Evaluations have shown some positive employment effects from them.",
      "However, the OBR concluded last year that the evidence base was still limited and did not suggest such programmes have, so far, made a \"significant contribution\" to getting people into work.",
      "That implies the official forecaster may hesitate to assume greater state investment in these schemes will pay for itself through higher employment and tax revenues, and result in net savings in public expenditure.",
      "Nevertheless, some experts argue it would make sense for the government to re-assess more regularly whether people in receipt of health and disability benefits are still unable to work and - if their circumstances are found to have changed - to provide them with additional support to get into the workforce.",
      "\"Not doing reassessments and work-focused interviews definitely makes things worse,\" says Jonathan Portes, a former chief economist at the Department for Work & Pensions.",
      "Correction 17 March: an earlier version of this article wrongly stated the percentage of claimants' appeals upheld, based on DWP appeals. The article has been updated to reflect the full proportion, upheld at independent tribunal.",

      "In a speech, he said politicians had chosen to hide behind quangos and he took aim at a \"cottage industry of checkers and blockers slowing down delivery for working people\".",
      "But the key announcement was the abolition of the \"world's largest quango\", NHS England, which works with the government to agree funding and priorities, and oversees the delivery of services.",
      "He announced the government was bringing it back under the control of the Department of Health.",
      "Incoming governments have often sought to cut the number of quangos - but what are they and what do they do?",
      "What is a quango?",
      "Quango stands for Quasi-Autonomous Non-Governmental Organisation, but the government calls them \"arm's length bodies\". They are organisations such as regulators, cultural institutions and advisory bodies, which are funded by taxpayers but not directly controlled from Whitehall.",
      "They range from huge organisations like NHS England, to smaller ones like the Gambling Commission and the British Film Institute.",
      "How many quangos are there?",
      "The number of quangos has fallen by more than half since 2010 but there are still more than 300 across the UK.",
      "Under the Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition, nearly 300 were axed - dubbed the \"bonfire of the quangos\" - in an attempt to improve accountability and cut costs.",
      "Despite Sir Keir indicating he would also like to reduce the role of quangos, the new Labour government has set up more than 20 since winning power.",
      "These include Great British Energy, which will invest in renewable energy to help meet the government's clean power goals, and Skills England, which aims to support people in finding jobs.",
      "Asked earlier this week if the government was planning another \"bonfire of the quangos\", Downing Street said the PM wanted to see a more \"active and agile state\", rather than \"outsourcing\" decisions to other bodies.",
      "How much do they cost?",
      "Almost 60% of day-to-day government spending is channelled through quangos, with 90% of this going to the largest 10 bodies.",
      "The total budget for quangos in 2022/23 - the latest published figures - was \u00a3353.3bn.",
      "Why are they controversial?",

      "The Institute for Government think tank says in some cases scrapping public bodies can save money and improve how services are delivered.",
      "It gives the example of how absorbing JobCentre Plus into the Department for Work and Pensions helped cut the department's workforce and office space by a third.",

      "Confirming details of how international aid funding will be reallocated to defence, following the prime minister's announcement that UK defence spending will rise to 2.5% of national income by 2027.",
      "Government sources have been keen to state that this event is not a major one because it will not include tax rises, only spending cuts.",
      "A debateable tax hiking policy could be announced, however, if Reeves decides to extend the freeze on the thresholds at which people start to pay different rates of income tax.",
      "The policy is known as a hidden tax rise or stealth tax, as it takes effect over time as people are dragged into paying more tax as their pay goes up, without the tax rate rising at all.",
      "Thresholds were frozen by the previous Conservative government until April 2028, but the chancellor could decide to extend the freeze beyond this to raise about \u00a37bn a year, according to consultancy Pantheon Macroeconomics and investment bank Citi.",
      "Reeves decided not to extend the threshold freeze in her first Budget, arguing that doing so \"would hurt working people\" and \"take more money out of their payslips\".",
      "Whether any other spending cuts are announced in the Spring Statement or in the Spending Review in June, or even delayed until the next Budget, remains to be seen.",
      "How is the UK economy doing?",
      "Recent figures show UK economic growth has been sluggish, with the Office for National Statistics describing the situation as one of \"weak growth\".",
      "The economy grew by just 0.1% between October and December 2024, while the latest monthly figures show it contracted by 0.1% in January.",
      "When an economy grows, more businesses can employ extra workers or give pay rises. Firms making higher profits also pay more in tax to the government, which can be spent on public services.",
      "In addition to slow growth, prices are also rising faster than wanted.",
      "The current inflation rate of 3% is higher than the Bank of England's 2% target, and is forecast to go higher. Inflation could dictate whether interest rates are lowered further from their current 4.5%.",
      "Higher rates mean higher borrowing costs for loans, credit cards and mortgage deals, but it also provides better returns on savings.",
      "Costs for businesses are expected to jump further in April, when National Insurance contributions paid by employers rise. These could be passed on to consumers.",
      "Pressure has also increased on the chancellor's tax and spending plans after a surplus in government finances missed official forecasts, prompting speculation from economists that she could break her fiscal rules as things stand.",
      "Borrowing costs for the UK surged in January in part due to concerns over the UK's economic outlook, threatening Reeves's economic plans. The costs have since fallen back but remain higher than this time last year.",
      "Reeves has also warned that a potential global trade war, despite tariffs not directly targeting the UK, would lower growth and raise inflation."

    "published": "Thu, 13 Mar 2025 15:18:13 GMT",
    "summary": "Sir Keir's argument overlaps with the former PM's - that the proliferation of arm's length bodies slow down change.",
    "story": [
      "It is a comparison neither would likely welcome, but look closely and the arguments of Sir Keir Starmer and Liz Truss about why government doesn't work well enough are remarkably similar.",
      "Neither are the first to grumble about the machinery of government.",
      "More than 20 years ago, Sir Tony Blair gave a speech much of which Sir Keir could give today.",
      "\"Sometimes we can be so frightened of the process of accountability, we opt for inertia,\" Sir Tony said in 2004, adding that too often the civil service had acted as \"a shock absorber in order to maintain the status quo\".",
      "So claims about a lack of nimbleness and pace are not new.",
      "But a core strand of Sir Keir's argument overlaps with Liz Truss's.",
      "Perhaps the person the prime minister has to thank the most for his whopping majority has been making the case he is now making for a while.",
      "Their language and emphases may be different, but the diagnosis is the same.",
      "Starmer and Dominic Cummings now agree on one thing - the civil service is a problem",
      "Starmer pledges to tackle 'flabby' state",
      "Starmer pitches reform to 'shackled' civil servants",
      "Sir Keir Starmer says the state has become \"overcautious\" and \"flabby\" and government has become bigger, but weaker.",
      "By weaker, he means a growing inability to make stuff happen and a big reason for that, he reckons, is the proliferation of arm's length bodies \u2013 taxpayer funded organisations with independence from the government and considerable power.",
      "There has been a growing sense in Downing Street as the prime minister and his team have adjusted to life in government that organisations dreamt up as a wheeze by previous governments so they don't get blamed for this or that all too often now stand in the way of a minister being able to do what they want.",
      "The recent row about the Sentencing Council in England and Wales is seen as a case in point.",
      "And now, scrapping NHS England is, ministers will argue, the ultimate case study in scrapping unaccountable bureaucracy.",
      "Scale of challenge",
      "So what did Liz Truss argue after her time in government?",
      "She talked of the \"tyranny of the technocracy\", the \"power of the administrative state\" and argued that \"there is something rather undemocratic about this\".",
      "She said that \"Blair and Brown had imposed a web of legalistic architecture that added process and put more power in the hands of technocrats\", which granted is a point where you might think Truss and Starmer would depart and no doubt do in many instances.",
      "But strikingly, given that recent row about the Sentencing Council, when was it set up?",
      "In April 2010, when Gordon Brown was prime minister.",
      "\"For any challenge faced, for too long the answer has been more arm's length bodies, quangos and regulators which end up blocking the government,\" Sir Keir writes in the Daily Telegraph, without reference to any particular such body.",
      "It is also true that this new-ish government has itself created new arms-length bodies, such as GB Energy and Skills England.",
      "Perhaps it is human nature - that your own arm's length bodies don't feel as pernicious as ones dreamt up by a predecessor.",
      "Beyond the comparisons, the reason all this matters is the government is up against a pervasive sense that nothing works any more.",
      "Think the 8am scramble for an appointment with the doctor and the waiting lists for an operation for a start.",
      "Some senior Labour figures fret privately that their talk of \"missions\" and a \"Plan for Change\" might seem puny to many in comparison with the scale of that challenge.",
      "The prime minister said: \"Every pound that we spend, every regulation, every decision must deliver for working people. And I don't just mean efficiency...I mean something else which is allowing the state, the government, to operate what I call maximum power.\"",
      "The prime minister's speech is both a symptom of his early frustration at the capacity of government to get stuff done - and an acknowledgement of the urgency to do just that.",

    "published": "Wed, 12 Mar 2025 16:13:02 GMT",
    "summary": "How much will the UK be hit by US tariffs and what happens next?",
    "story": [
      "Despite the government's hopes, the UK has not, in the end, been exempted from President Trump's 25% steel and aluminium tariffs.",
      "Prime Minister Keir Starmer has said the UK will \"keep all options on the table\", but has not announced immediate retaliation.",
      "BBC Verify looks at how big the impact on the UK could be and what might happen next.",
      "Starmer says 'all options on table' on US tariffs",
      "Metal products",
      "The value of the UK's raw steel and aluminium exports to the US in 2024 was around \u00a3470m.",
      "But it's important to note that these latest US tariffs - taxes on imports - also cover products made with steel and aluminium, which covers everything from gym equipment, to furniture, to machinery.",
      "It's estimated by the Global Trade Alert think tank that the UK's exports of these products to the US in 2024 was around \u00a32.2bn.",
      "So the total annual value of UK exports affected would be around \u00a32.7bn.",
      "For context, the UK exported around \u00a358bn of goods to the US on an annual basis in 2024 - so the share of goods hit by these new Trump tariffs represents just under 5%.",
      "The UK hopes to conclude a free trade deal with the Trump administration, which could mean these tariffs being removed.",
      "But we have no way of knowing if - or how soon - such an agreement could be concluded.",
      "Trump has also threatened to impose reciprocal tariffs on all the United States' trading partners, including the UK, from next month.",
      "These are taxes on imports to the US which are set at a similar rate to taxes other countries put on goods they import from the US.",
      "And the White House has said that, in deciding what level to set them, it will take into account countries' Value Added Tax rates.",
      "The US government regards VAT as a tax that discriminates against US imports - even though it applies equally to imports and domestically-produced goods.",
      "The UK has a 20% standard VAT rate, which could potentially mean the UK being hit by a substantial reciprocal tariff from the US.",
      "While the UK is not yet retaliating, the European Union has already confirmed it plans to impose tariffs on 26bn euros (\u00a322bn) a year worth of goods imported from America.",
      "And the EU is targeting US goods including Bourbon whiskey, jeans and Harley-Davidson motorcycles, which are considered to be politically sensitive in America because of their iconic status and because of which US states some of them are  produced in.",
      "Notwithstanding the hope for a free trade deal, in the wake of any reciprocal tariffs imposed by the US, which are perceived to be unfair and punitive, the UK government could find itself under growing pressure to retaliate in a similar way to the EU.",
      "Why is Trump imposing tariffs?",
      "The US President has a long - and often shifting - list of justifications for imposing these import taxes.",
      "One is that he claims to want to restore fairness to America's trading relations with the rest of the world.",
      "Trump complains that some other countries have higher tariffs on the goods they import from the US, than the other way round.",
      "The US had an average external tariff of 3.3% in 2023.",
      "That was slightly lower than the UK's average tariff of 3.8%.",
      "It was also below the European Union's average tariff of 5% and China's average tariff of 7.5%.",
      "However, America's average tariff was considerably lower than those of some of its other trading partners such as India (17%) and South Korea (13.4%).",
      "Broadly speaking, it is legitimate for Trump to point out that some countries have a higher average tariff on imports than America does.",
      "Replacing income tax?",
      "Another justification for tariffs from the president is raising more tax revenue for the US government. At one stage during the presidential election campaign in 2024, he suggested that tariff revenue could entirely replace the federal income tax.",
      "This is not only implausible given the $3 trillion a year value of US imports and the $2 trillion a year raised by income tax - but it needs to be seen in the context of the fact that tariffs would push up US consumer prices.",
      "Trump also wants to put pressure on other countries to change some of their policies. This has been the explicit rationale for US tariffs on Canada and Mexico, with the White House saying it wants to pressure those countries to stamp out cross-border Fentanyl smuggling.",
      "Another key goal articulated by the president is wanting to encourage multinational manufacturing companies to invest and produce more in America to create domestic jobs.",
      "Some of these justifications are inconsistent.",
      "Tariffs cannot be a both a major permanent tax revenue raiser as well as a way to bring manufacturing back to America on a large scale as the latter implies imports - and therefore tariff revenues - slumping.",
      "Moreover, the vast majority of economists are also extremely sceptical about the likelihood of tariffs achieving many of these goals.",

      "That was partly drawn from her mandate - an extraordinary run of election wins that made her leader of the third placed party at Westminster.",
      "That gave her a voice in debates about Brexit and offered the UK media a political contrast with a succession of Conservative prime ministers, including Boris Johnson.",
      "She was also seen as a persistent threat to the continuation of the UK state, pushing the boundaries of devolution in pursuit of her ambition to hold another independence referendum.",
      "In the end, neither the forces of her personality or argument were able to bring that about.",
      "Her strategy collapsed when the UK Supreme Court ruled that any future vote must be agreed with the UK government.",
      "Subsequent talk of using a UK general election as a substitute referendum lacked credibility.",
      "This was a significant factor in what brought her leadership to a close, as was her focus on the politics of switching gender identity - ironically the subject of an opposition debate at Holyrood today.",
      "There were also the divisions in the SNP and the wider independence movement caused by the spectacular fallout Sturgeon had with her predecessor, Alex Salmond, when the Scottish government mishandled harassment complaints against him.",
      "Then there was her attempt to realign Scottish politics by forming a power-sharing partnership with the Greens to achieve political stability for the Scottish government.",
      "That controversial arrangement was discontinued by her immediate successor Humza Yousaf.",
      "What will be her legacy?",
      "She was the first minister who expanded early learning and childcare and used new welfare powers to introduce a weekly child payment unique to Scotland - policies she would regard as significant achievements.",
      "While opposition parties say they would maintain these benefits, financial watchdogs warn that the extent of health and social welfare spending in Scotland is unsustainable.",
      "All of this is part of the Sturgeon legacy to be debated as she counts down to her departure from the Scottish Parliament in just over a year.",
      "Nicola Sturgeon famously made decisions in a very tight circle and according to one adviser her decision-making group became ever smaller.",
      "By the end, this source said she was operating in \"a circle of one\".",
      "It was ultimately her decision to leave high office just as it is now hers to leave frontline politics altogether.",

      "But a spokesperson for the South African government told the BBC \"there was an assault\" at the station, following earlier allegations of inappropriate behaviour from inside the camp.",
      "In a further message seen by the BBC, the South African environment ministry said it was responding to the concerns with \"utmost urgency\".",
      "South Africa's Sunday Times, which was first to report the story, said members of the team had pleaded to be rescued.",
      "The ministry said that those in the team had been subject to \"a number of evaluations that include background checks, reference checks, medical assessment as well as a psychometric evaluation by qualified professionals\", which all members had cleared.",
      "In a subsequent statement, the ministry added that it was \"not uncommon\" for individuals to have an initial adjustment when they arrive at extremely remote areas even if assessments showed no areas of concern.",
      "It said when the vessel departed for Antarctica on 1 February \"all was in order\", and the incident was first reported to the ministry on 27 February.",
      "The statement added the department \"immediately activated the response plan in order to mediate and restore relations at the base\".",
      "\"This process has been ongoing on an almost daily basis in order to ensure that those on the base know that the Department is supportive and willing to do whatever is needed to restore the interpersonal relationships, but also firm in dealing with issues of discipline,\" it said.",

      "The department added that a government minister was personally handling the incident, and the alleged perpetrator had \"willingly participated in further psychological evaluation, has shown remorse and is willingly cooperative to follow any interventions that are recommended\".",
      "The alleged perpetrator has also written a formal apology to the victim, it said.",
      "The Sanae IV research base is located more than 4,000km from mainland South Africa and harsh weather conditions mean scientists can be cut off there for much of the year.",
      "The base typically houses staff who stay through the Antarctic winter for approximately 13 months.",
      "South African research expeditions have been taking place since 1959. The team to the Sanae IV base typically comprises a doctor, two mechanics, three engineers, a meteorological technician and a couple of physicists.",
      "These expeditions, with harsh weather conditions mandating a lot of time spent in a confined indoor space, normally run without incident.",

      "\"So issues about hierarchy, about workload allocation, even small things about leisure time or rations or food portions can rapidly flare up to become something much larger than they typically are,\" he told the BBC.",

    "summary": "Despite dire predictions of climate breakdown, more Sports Utility Vehicles are being spotted on, and off, the roads.",
    "story": [
      "Across the globe more and more Sports Utility Vehicles (SUVs) are being spotted on \u2013 and off \u2013 the roads.",
      "This is despite predictions from the United Nations of an inevitable pivot towards smaller and more environmentally friendly vehicles because of the urgency of the climate crisis and the rising cost of living.",
      "That pivot has not materialised: globally, 54% of the cars sold in 2024 were SUVs, including petrol, diesel, hybrids and electric makes. This is an increase of three percentage points from 2023 and five percentage points from the year before, according to GlobalData.",
      "Of the SUVs which are now on the road \u2013 both new and older models \u2013 95% are burning fossil fuels, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA).",
      "Manufacturers, however, say their new fleets of such cars are increasingly becoming electric, and that not all SUVs now being sold cause an increase in emissions.",
      "SUVs are hard to miss. They are heavy and larger with spacious interiors, higher ground clearance and a high driving position with a better view of the road, although smaller versions are also on the market.",
      "Environmental campaigners such as Greenpeace see SUVs as one of the villains of the climate crisis and argue that their manufacturing consumes significant resources given their size.",
      "Experts also say they require larger batteries to power their electric versions, which then further increases the demand for critical minerals, putting even more pressure on the planet.",
      "Momentum was thought to be with smaller, energy-efficient electric vehicles. But the sales of standard-sized electric vehicles (EVs) has actually decreased in major markets such as Japan and Germany, and their sales growth has slowed in India.",
      "And in Europe, sales of SUVs have outpaced those of EVs despite indications more than half a decade ago of an opposite trend. In Europe in 2018, 3.27 million small hatchbacks \u2013 both those powered by fossil fuels and those by electricity \u2013 were sold while 2.13 million were sold in 2024, according to GlobalData.",
      "Its sales forecast manager Sammy Chan said: \"This is partly because of the SUV alternatives being offered in smaller [sizes] whose sales in Europe have now grown to nearly to 2.5 million in 2024 from 1.5 million in 2018.\"",
      "China saw the largest sales of nearly 11.6 million SUVs in 2024 followed by the US, India and Germany, according to GlobalData.",
      "What is driving this SUV growth?",
      "Industry experts say people's purchasing power has been improving in many fast-emerging economies, making SUVs the likelier choice of car.",
      "\"Manufacturers respond to consumer demand and, increasingly, drivers are attracted to dual purpose vehicles given their practicality, comfort and good view of the road,\" said Mike Hawes who is the chief executive of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT).",
      "Automobile industry analysts also say that manufacturers are attracted to high profit margins from SUVs: they can make more money from SUVs even though they make fewer vehicles.",
      "\"It is the industry that has driven the demand through huge marketing and advertising campaigns in recent years,\" said Dudley Curtis, the communications manager at the European Transport Safety Council.",
      "\"SUVs offered the industry a simple way of charging more for a vehicle that does the same thing [as others],\" he said.",
      "Are SUVs an issue?",
      "Because of the robust growth in SUVs sales, the IEA says oil consumption of these  vehicles has increased by 600,000 barrels per day globally between 2022 and 2023, accounting for more than a quarter of the total annual rise in global oil demand.",
      "\"If ranked among countries, the global fleet of SUVs would be the world's fifth largest emitter of CO2, exceeding the emissions of Japan and various other major economies,\" said Apostolous Petropolous, an energy modeller with the IEA.",
      "The agency says that even when compared to medium-sized cars that run on petrol and diesel, SUVs burn 20% more of such fuels as they weigh up to 300 kg more on average.",
      "In fact, road transport is responsible for more than 12% of global carbon emissions which is the main driver of global warming. Scientists say all sectors must rapidly decarbonise if we are to avoid a climate catastrophe.",
      "But industry representatives say in response that not all SUVs now being sold cause an increase in emissions.",
      "BMW delays electric Mini over 'uncertainty'",
      "Why don't Europeans buy more American cars?",
      "\"Around two in five of these [new] vehicle models are zero emission as their body type lends itself well to electrification with longer battery range that can reassure consumers concerned about charging accessibility,\" said Hawes, from the SMMT.",
      "\"This has led to the average CO2 emissions of new dual purpose cars more than halving since 2000, helping the segment lead the decarbonisation of UK road mobility.\"",
      "Although the vast majority of new SUVs still burn fossil fuels, IEA officials have said that over 20% of SUVs sold in 2023 were fully electric, up from 2% in 2018.",

    "summary": "Despite dire predictions of climate breakdown, more Sports Utility Vehicles are being spotted on, and off, the roads.",
    "story": [
      "Across the globe more and more Sports Utility Vehicles (SUVs) are being spotted on \u2013 and off \u2013 the roads.",
      "This is despite predictions from the United Nations of an inevitable pivot towards smaller and more environmentally friendly vehicles because of the urgency of the climate crisis and the rising cost of living.",
      "That pivot has not materialised: globally, 54% of the cars sold in 2024 were SUVs, including petrol, diesel, hybrids and electric makes. This is an increase of three percentage points from 2023 and five percentage points from the year before, according to GlobalData.",
      "Of the SUVs which are now on the road \u2013 both new and older models \u2013 95% are burning fossil fuels, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA).",
      "Manufacturers, however, say their new fleets of such cars are increasingly becoming electric, and that not all SUVs now being sold cause an increase in emissions.",
      "SUVs are hard to miss. They are heavy and larger with spacious interiors, higher ground clearance and a high driving position with a better view of the road, although smaller versions are also on the market.",
      "Environmental campaigners such as Greenpeace see SUVs as one of the villains of the climate crisis and argue that their manufacturing consumes significant resources given their size.",
      "Experts also say they require larger batteries to power their electric versions, which then further increases the demand for critical minerals, putting even more pressure on the planet.",
      "Momentum was thought to be with smaller, energy-efficient electric vehicles. But the sales of standard-sized electric vehicles (EVs) has actually decreased in major markets such as Japan and Germany, and their sales growth has slowed in India.",
      "And in Europe, sales of SUVs have outpaced those of EVs despite indications more than half a decade ago of an opposite trend. In Europe in 2018, 3.27 million small hatchbacks \u2013 both those powered by fossil fuels and those by electricity \u2013 were sold while 2.13 million were sold in 2024, according to GlobalData.",
      "Its sales forecast manager Sammy Chan said: \"This is partly because of the SUV alternatives being offered in smaller [sizes] whose sales in Europe have now grown to nearly to 2.5 million in 2024 from 1.5 million in 2018.\"",
      "China saw the largest sales of nearly 11.6 million SUVs in 2024 followed by the US, India and Germany, according to GlobalData.",
      "What is driving this SUV growth?",
      "Industry experts say people's purchasing power has been improving in many fast-emerging economies, making SUVs the likelier choice of car.",
      "\"Manufacturers respond to consumer demand and, increasingly, drivers are attracted to dual purpose vehicles given their practicality, comfort and good view of the road,\" said Mike Hawes who is the chief executive of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT).",
      "Automobile industry analysts also say that manufacturers are attracted to high profit margins from SUVs: they can make more money from SUVs even though they make fewer vehicles.",
      "\"It is the industry that has driven the demand through huge marketing and advertising campaigns in recent years,\" said Dudley Curtis, the communications manager at the European Transport Safety Council.",
      "\"SUVs offered the industry a simple way of charging more for a vehicle that does the same thing [as others],\" he said.",
      "Are SUVs an issue?",
      "Because of the robust growth in SUVs sales, the IEA says oil consumption of these  vehicles has increased by 600,000 barrels per day globally between 2022 and 2023, accounting for more than a quarter of the total annual rise in global oil demand.",
      "\"If ranked among countries, the global fleet of SUVs would be the world's fifth largest emitter of CO2, exceeding the emissions of Japan and various other major economies,\" said Apostolous Petropolous, an energy modeller with the IEA.",
      "The agency says that even when compared to medium-sized cars that run on petrol and diesel, SUVs burn 20% more of such fuels as they weigh up to 300 kg more on average.",
      "In fact, road transport is responsible for more than 12% of global carbon emissions which is the main driver of global warming. Scientists say all sectors must rapidly decarbonise if we are to avoid a climate catastrophe.",
      "But industry representatives say in response that not all SUVs now being sold cause an increase in emissions.",
      "BMW delays electric Mini over 'uncertainty'",
      "Why don't Europeans buy more American cars?",
      "\"Around two in five of these [new] vehicle models are zero emission as their body type lends itself well to electrification with longer battery range that can reassure consumers concerned about charging accessibility,\" said Hawes, from the SMMT.",
      "\"This has led to the average CO2 emissions of new dual purpose cars more than halving since 2000, helping the segment lead the decarbonisation of UK road mobility.\"",
      "Although the vast majority of new SUVs still burn fossil fuels, IEA officials have said that over 20% of SUVs sold in 2023 were fully electric, up from 2% in 2018.",
      "As for hybrids that can run on both electricity and fossil fuels, a study in Europe by the International Council on Clean Transportation in 2022 found only around 30% of the total distance driven by plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (all types including SUVs) was in electric mode on average.",
      "Similar results were found in other major economies such as the US and China.",
      "Overall, the back-gear towards SUVs, some experts say, has caused a significant setback in the decarbonisation of the transport sector.",
      "\"The trend toward heavier and less efficient vehicles such as SUVs (in countries where it is happening) has largely nullified the improvements in energy consumption and emissions achieved elsewhere in the world's passenger car fleet,\" said the IEA.",
      "The UK Parliament's climate change committee had a similar finding in its 2024 report on decarbonisation in the country."

      "After an epic nine months in space, Nasa astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams are finally on their way home.",
      "Their stay on the International Space Station (ISS) was only supposed to last eight days, but their mission was dramatically extended after the spacecraft that they arrived on suffered technical problems.",
      "The pair are travelling back to Earth in a SpaceX capsule along with Nasa astronaut Nick Hague and Russian cosmonaut Aleksandr Gorbunov.",
      "They undocked from the ISS at 05:05 GMT (01:05 EDT) on Tuesday and are set to splash down off the coast of Florida later the same day, at 21:57 GMT (17:57 EDT) .",
      "Their landing time, however, could change if the weather conditions are not good enough.",
      "It will mark the end of a mission that has grabbed the world's attention, however the final stages of their journey won't be easy.",
      "The SpaceX Dragon capsule will make a fast and fiery re-entry through the Earth's atmosphere, enduring temperatures of up to 1600C.",
      "As it rapidly slows, the astronauts will experience significant g-forces, about four times the Earth's gravity.",
      "Finally, four large parachutes will open, allowing the craft to land gently in the ocean.",
      "Helen Sharman, Britain's first astronaut, said the thrilling ride would be worth it.",

      "Stranded astronauts heading back to Earth after nine months in space",
      "Nasa needs saving from itself \u2013 but is this billionaire right for that job?",
      "The saga of Butch and Suni began in June 2024.",
      "They were taking part in the first crewed test flight of the Starliner spacecraft, developed by aerospace company Boeing.",
      "But the capsule suffered several technical problems during its journey to the space station, and it was deemed too risky to take the astronauts home.",
      "Starliner returned safely to Earth empty in early September, but it meant the pair needed a new ride for their return.",
      "So Nasa opted for the next scheduled flight: a SpaceX capsule that arrived at the ISS in late September.",
      "It flew with two astronauts instead of four, leaving two seats spare for Butch and Suni's return. The only catch was this had a planned six month mission, extending the astronauts stay until now.",
      "The arrival of a replacement crew on Sunday was the final step needed for Butch and Suni's return \u2013 and after a short hand over with the new team, their mission is now at an end.",
      "The Nasa pair have embraced their longer than expected stay in space.",
      "They've carried out an array of experiments on board the orbiting lab and conducted spacewalks, with Suni breaking the record for the woman who's spent the most hours outside of the space station.",
      "And despite the astronauts being described as \"stranded\" they never really were.",
      "Throughout their mission there have always been spacecraft attached to the space station to get them - and the rest of those onboard - home if there was an emergency.",
      "Speaking in the weeks before their departure, Butch Wilmore said they weren't fazed when their mission was extended.",
      "\"We came up prepared to stay long, even though we plan to stay short. That's what we do in human space flight. That's what your nation's human space flight programme is all about,\" he said.",
      "Suni added that she was sad this would probably be her last mission.",
      "\"I think just the fact that we're living up here, in this very unique place, gives you an amazing perspective,\" she said. \"I don't want to lose that spark of inspiration when I leave, so I'm going to have to bottle it somehow.\"",
      "The pair's mission attracted even more publicity last month after SpaceX CEO Elon Musk said that the astronauts had been left in space for political reasons, and his company could have brought them home sooner.",
      "But Nasa officials said their decisions were based on flight scheduling and the space station's needs.",
      "Garrett Reisman, a former Nasa astronaut and former director of space operations at SpaceX, said there were good reasons why Nasa didn't opt for a dedicated rescue mission.",
      "\"It wasn't going to reduce the amount of time that Butch and Suni spent in space by very much - I mean, you'd shave a couple of months off, so the benefit wasn't that great,\" he told BBC News.",
      "\"And the cost was high - these crew missions cost hundreds of millions of dollars\u2026. I think Butch and Suni would have been the first ones to say 'no, that's not worth it'.\"",
      "Once the astronauts have arrived home, they will be taken to the Johnson Space Centre in Houston, Texas, where they will be checked over by medical experts.",
      "Long duration missions in space take a toll on the body, as astronauts lose bone density and suffer muscle loss. Blood circulation is also affected, and fluid shifts can also impact eyesight.",
      "It can take a long time for the body to return to normal, so the pair will be given an extensive exercise regime as their bodies re-adapt to living with gravity. But the first priority for Butch and Suni will be to see their families, friends - and pets.",
      "Garrett Reisman has been in touch with his friend Suni while she's been in space.",
      "\"I had an email from Suni just the other day where she talked about missing sitting on the porch in her house in Maine with the dogs, and smelling the fresh air, feeling the sun on your face,\" he told the BBC.",
      "\"It's the basic things about life here on Earth that you miss.\""

    "published": "Fri, 14 Mar 2025 01:26:54 GMT",
    "summary": "The president once derided attempts to develop new green technology as a \"green new scam\" - but his deal could help boost the US's potential in the sector",
    "story": [
      "Listen to Esme read this article",
      "Donald Trump's return to the White House is a \"major blow to global climate action\". So said Christiana Figueres, the former UN climate chief, after he was elected in November.",
      "Since taking office, Trump has withdrawn the US from what is considered the most important global climate pact, the Paris Climate Agreement. He has also reportedly prevented US scientists from participating in international climate research and removed national electric vehicle targets.",
      "Plus, he derided his predecessor's attempts to develop new green technology a \"green new scam\".",
      "And yet despite his history on the issue of climate, Trump has been eager to make a deal with the Ukrainian president on critical minerals. He has also taken a strong interest in Greenland and Canada \u2013 both nations rich in critical minerals.",
      "Critical mineral procurement has been a major focus for Trump since he took office. These minerals are crucial in industries including aerospace and defence, but intriguingly, they have another major use too - to manufacture green technology.",
      "So, could Trump's focus on obtaining these minerals have a knock-on effect, and help unlock the US's potential in the green technology sector?",
      "The Elon Musk effect?",
      "Trump's right-hand man understands more than most the importance of critical minerals in the green transition. Space X and Tesla \u2013 the companies Elon Musk leads - rely heavily on critical minerals like graphite (in electric vehicles), lithium (in batteries) and nickel (in rockets).",
      "Elizabeth Holley, an associate professor of mining engineering at Colorado School of Mines, explains that each nation has its own list of critical minerals, but they are generally made up of rare earths and other metals like lithium.",
      "She says demand is booming - in 2023, demand for lithium grew by 30%. This is being driven mostly by the rapid growth in the clean energy and electric vehicle sectors.",
      "Within two decades, they will make up almost 90% of the demand for lithium, 70% of the demand for cobalt, and 40% for rare earths, according to the International Energy Agency.",
      "Such has been Musk's concern with getting hold of some of these minerals that three years ago he tweeted: \"Price of lithium has gone to insane levels! Tesla might actually have to get into the mining & refining directly at scale, unless costs improve.\"",
      "He went on to write that there is no shortage of the element, but the pace of extraction is slow.",
      "The US position in the global race",
      "The weakness of the US position in rare earths and critical minerals (such as cobalt and nickel) was addressed in a report published by a US Government Select Committee in December 2023. It said: \"The United States must rethink its policy approach to critical mineral and rare earth element supply chains because of the risks posed by our current dependence on the People's Republic of China.\"",
      "Failure to do so, it warned, could cause \"defense production to grind to a halt and choke off manufacturing of other advanced technologies\".",
      "China's dominance in the market has come from its early recognition of the economic opportunities that green technology offers.",
      "\"China made a decision about 10 years ago about where the trend was going and has strategically pursued the development of not just renewables but also electric vehicles and now dominates the market,\" says Bob Ward, policy director at The London School of Economics (LSE) Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment.",
      "Daisy Jennings-Gray, head of prices at price reporting agency Benchmark Mineral Intelligence, explains that they are critical minerals because they are geologically restricted. \"You cannot guarantee you will have economically recoverable reserves in every country.\"",
      "Some minerals like lithium are abundant on Earth, but often they are located in difficult to reach places, so the logistics of a mining project can be very expensive. In other cases, there is dependency on one country that produces a large share of global supply \u2013 like cobalt from the the Democratic Republic of Congo. This means that if there is a natural disaster or political unrest it has an impact on the price, says Ms Jennings-Gray.",
      "China has managed to shore up supply by investing heavily in Africa and South America, but where it really has a stronghold on the market is in processing (or the separation of the mineral from other elements in the rock).",
      "\"China accounts for 60% of global rare earth production but processes nearly 90% - [it] is dominant on this stage,\" says Gracelin Baskaran, director of the critical minerals security program at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies in Washington DC.",
      "She says the country understands how important this is in economic trade - a few days after Trump introduced tariffs on China its government hit back by imposing export controls on more than 20 critical minerals including graphite and tungsten.",
      "What is motivating Trump is a fear of being at a disadvantage, argues Christopher Knittel, a professor of applied economics at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).",
      "\"I think what is driving this is because China is the dominant player on the processing side,\" he says. \"It is that processing stage, which is the high-margin stage of the business, so China is making a lot of money.\"",
      "As he puts it, it is a \"happy coincidence\" that this could end up supporting green technology.",
      "The key question, though, is whether the US is too late to fully capitalise on the sector.",
      "A stark warning for the US",
      "In the early days, the green transition was \"framed as a burden\" for countries, according to LSE's Bob Ward.",
      "The Biden administration was highly supportive of green technology industries through its introduction of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) in August 2022, which offers tax credits, loans and other incentives to technologies that reduce greenhouse gas emissions, from battery technologies for electric vehicles to solar panels.",
      "By August 2024, it was estimated to have brought $493bn (\u00a3382bn) of investment to US green industry, according to the think tank Clean Investment Monitor.",
      "And yet little work was done to support upstream processes like obtaining critical minerals, says Ms Gray from Benchmark Intelligence. Instead, the Biden administration focused heavily on downstream manufacturing - the process of getting products from the manufacturer to the end consumer.",
      "But Trump's recent moves to procure these critical minerals suggest a focus on the upstream process may now be happening.",
      "\"The IRA put a lot of legislation in places to limit trade and supply only from friendly nations,\" explains Ms Gray.",
      "\"Trump is changing tack and looking at securing critical minerals agreements that owes something to the US.\"",
      "Whispers of another executive order",
      "There could be further moves from Trump coming down the line. Those working in the sector say whispers in the corridors of the White House suggest that he may be about to pass a \"Critical Minerals Executive Order\", which could funnel further investment into this objective.",
      "The exact details that may be included in the executive order remain unclear, but experts knowledgeable with the issue have said it may include measures to accelerate mining in the US, including fast tracking permits and investment to construct processing plants.",
      "Although work may now be under way to secure these minerals, Prof Willy Shih of Harvard Business School thinks that the US administration lacks understanding of the technical complexity of establishing mineral supply chains, and emphasises the time commitment required. \"If you want to build a new mine and processing facility, it might take you 10 years.\"",
      "As a policy of his predecessor, and one that is so obviously pro-climate action, Trump has been vocally opposed to maintaining the IRA. But its success in red states mean that many Republican senators have been trying to convince him to keep it in some form in his proposed \"big, beautiful bill\" - the plan to pile all of Trump's main policy goals into one mega-bill - due to be revealed later this month.",
      "Analysis by the Clean Investment Monitor shows in the last 18 months Republican-held states had received 77% of the investment.",
      "MIT's Dr Knittel says for states like Georgia, which has become part of what is now known as the \"battery belt\" following a boom in battery production following IRA support, these tax credits are crucial for these industries to survive.",
      "He adds that failure to do so poses a real political threat for US representatives who are up for re-election in less than two years.",
      "If Trump loses even just one seat to the Democrats in the 2026 mid-terms, then he loses the house majority - limiting his ability to pass key pieces of legislation.",
      "Carl Fleming was an advisor to former President Biden's Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Advisory Committee and is a partner at law firm McDermott, Will & Emery, advising clients in the clean tech and energy space. He says that despite the uncertainty, investors remain confident. \"In the last month, my practice has been busier than ever, and this is since quadrupling last year following the IRA.\"",
      "He also believes that there is a recognition of the need to maintain parts of the IRA \u2013 although this may be alongside expansion of some fossil fuels. \"If you are really trying to be 'America First' and energy secure, you want to pull on all your levers. Keep solar and keep battery storage going and add more natural gas to release America's energy prowess.\"",
      "But the uncertainty of the US position is little consolation for its absence on the international climate stage, says LSE's Bob Ward. \"When the Americans are on the ball it helps to move people in the right direction and that's how we got the Paris Climate Agreement.\"",
      "For those in the climate space, Trump is certainly not an environmentalist. What's clear is he is not concerned with making his legacy an environmental one but an economic one - though he could achieve the former if he can be convinced it will boost the economy.",

    "published": "Tue, 18 Mar 2025 01:27:38 GMT",
    "summary": "Ways are being developed for subsea cables to \"sense\" whether they are being disturbed or attacked.",
    "story": [
      "The diver had found the fibre optic cable lying on the seabed of the North Sea. He swam closer, until it was near enough to touch.",
      "He reached out his hand. But someone could tell he was lurking there. Someone was watching.",
      "\"He stops and just touches the cable lightly, you clearly see the signal,\" says Daniel Gerwig, global sales manager at AP Sensing, a German technology company. \"The acoustic energy which travels through the fibre is basically disturbing our signal. We can measure this disturbance.\"",
      "Multiple reports of damaged telecommunications cables in the Baltic Sea have raised alarm in recent months.",
      "So important are these cables, which carry huge volumes of internet data between countries, that Nato has launched a mission called \"Baltic Sentry\", to patrol the Baltic Sea with aircraft, warships and drones.",
      "The EU is also stepping up measures to monitor and protect cables.",
      "Despite those efforts the authorities cannot be everywhere at once.",
      "So, some companies are trying to monitor what's going on in the vicinity of any cable \u2013 by using fibre optic signals to listen out for surreptitious underwater drones, or hostile vessels dragging their anchors along the seabed.",
      "It was during tests of AP Sensing's system last year \u2013 not a real attempt at sabotage \u2013 that the diver patted his hand on the subsea cable watched over by the firm.",
      "The company also deployed ships, drones and divers with sea scooters to find out how accurately its software could pick out and identify the presence of these vehicles.",
      "And, the team tested whether their cable could \"hear\" a vessel plunging its anchor into the water.",
      "When pulses of light travel along a fibre optic strand, tiny reflections sometimes bounce back along that line. These reflections are affected by factors including temperature, vibrations or physical disturbance to the cable itself.",
      "Noticing a temperature change along part of a buried cable could reveal that part has become unburied, for example.",
      "AP Sensing shows me a video of a man walking across a lawn before lifting up a rifle and firing it during a test. A fibre optic cable buried in the ground a few metres away picked up the whole sequence.",
      "\"You see every single footstep,\" says Clemens Pohl, chief executive, as he points to a chart revealing disturbances in the fibre optic signal. The footsteps appear as brief blips or lines and the gunshot as a larger splodge.",
      "With this technology, it is even possible to work out the approximate size of a vessel passing above a subsea cable, as well as its location and, in some circumstances, its direction of travel. That could be correlated with satellite imagery, or even automatic identification system (AIS) records, which most ships broadcast at all times.",
      "It is possible to add monitoring capabilities to existing fibre optic cables if one unused, \"dark\" fibre is available, or a lit fibre with enough free channels, the firm adds.",
      "There are limitations, however. David Webb at Aston University says that fibre optic sensing technology cannot pick up disturbances from very far away, and you need to install signal listening devices, or interrogators, every 100km (62 miles) or so along a cable.",
      "AP Sensing says that it can pick up vibrations hundreds of metres away but \"usually not several kilometres away\". The company confirms that its technology is currently deployed on some cable installations in the North Sea, though declines to comment further.",
      "\"People really need an early warning in order to determine what to do,\" says Paul Heiden, chief executive of Optics11, a Dutch firm that also makes fibre optic acoustic sensing systems.",
      "Mr Heiden argues that cables installed solely for the purpose of monitoring marine activity could be especially useful \u2013 one might place such listening cables, say, 100km from a vital port, or in the vicinity of a key gas pipeline or telecommunications cable, rather than within those assets themselves.",
      "That could give operators an overview of vessel traffic in the area, and potentially advance notice of a ship heading towards a critical asset.",
      "Optics11's fibre optic listening technology can be deployed on military submarines, Mr Heiden adds, and he says the firm is soon to begin testing a monitoring cable installed somewhere on the floor of the Baltic Sea.",
      "Demand for fibre optic sensing technology is growing, says Douglas Clague at Viavi Solutions, a network testing and measurement company: \"We do see the number of requests increasing.\"",
      "Some of the cables damaged in recent incidents were made by Swedish cable company Hexatronic, says Christian Priess, head of Central Europe, Middle East, Africa and submarine cable business at the firm.",
      "Acoustic sensing is an emerging technology that Mr Priess suggests will become more common in the future. But there's relatively little one can do to protect a cable from sabotage, in terms of physical strengthening.",
      "Today's fibre optic cables already have metal casings folded and welded shut around the fibres, he says. There is also \"armoury wire\", thick metal cords, running along the outer parts of the cable and in some cases there are two layers of these cords. \"On the UK side of the Channel where you have a lot of rocks and a lot of fishing, you want to have it double-armoured,\" says Mr Priess.",
      "But should a vessel deliberately drag its heavy anchor across even a double-armoured cable, it will almost certainly still damage it, Mr Priess says \u2013 such is the force of the collision or pulling action.",
      "While it is possible to bury cables in the seabed for additional protection, this might become prohibitively expensive over long distances and at depths below a few dozen metres.",
      "\"Cables break all the time,\" says Lane Burdette, research analyst at TeleGeography, a telecoms market research firm. \"The number of cable faults per year has really held steady over the last several years,\" she adds, explaining that the 1-200 faults that typically occur annually has not risen despite ever more subsea cables being installed during that period.",
      "Ms Burdette also notes that, even when a cable is severed, telecommunications networks typically have significant redundancy built into them, meaning that end users often don't notice much disruption to their service.",
      "Still, the visible military response to cable breakages in the Baltic Sea is welcome, says Thorsten Benner, co-founder and director of the Global Public Policy Institute, a think tank: \"It's good that Nato and the European Union have woken up.\"",
      "And while cable sensing technology might be useful, its efficacy in terms of preventing damage rests on how quickly coastguard or military patrols could receive alerts about potential sabotage and react. \"The question is how quickly you could establish contact with a vessel,\" Says Benner.",

      "In the UK the Online Safety Act, which comes in to force in April, has strict laws for all tech firms specifically aimed at protecting children from online harms.",
      "But Mr Baszucki says he remains confident in Roblox's safety tools and insists the firm goes above and beyond to keep its users safe.",
      "\"We do in the company take the attitude that any bad, even one bad incident, is one too many,\" he says.",
      "\"We watch for bullying, we watch for harassment, we filter all of those kinds of things, and I would say behind the scenes, the analysis goes on all the way to, if necessary, reaching out to law enforcement.\"",
      "Players who choose not to display what he calls \"civility\" can face temporary time-outs and longer bans, and Roblox claims to analyse all communications that pass between members on the platform, increasingly using more advanced AI systems and other tech to do so \u2014 and anything flagged is sent for further investigation.",
      "In November last year, under 13s were banned from sending direct messages, and also from playing in \"hangout experiences\" which features chat between players.",
      "Safety filters bypassed",
      "However, the BBC was able to create two fake accounts, one aged 15 and one aged 27, on unlinked devices and exchange messages between the two.",
      "While the filters caught our attempts to overtly move the conversation onto a different platform, we found easy ways to re-word requests to chat elsewhere and make suggestions about playing more adult games.",
      "When we showed the Roblox boss these findings, he argued that our example highlighted the comparative safety of Roblox: that people felt they had to take content which might breach Roblox's rules to other platforms.",
      "\"We don't condone any type of image-sharing on our own platform, and you'll see us getting more and more, I think, way beyond where the law is on this type of behaviour,\" Mr Baszucki says.",
      "He admits there is a delicate balance between encouraging friendships between young people, and blocking opportunities for them come to harm, but says he is confident Roblox can manage both.",
      "We also put to him some Roblox game titles that the BBC has discovered were recommended by the platform to an 11 year-old recently, including:",
      "'Late Night Boys And Girls Club RP''Special Forces Simulator'''Squid Game''Shoot down planes\u2026because why not?'",
      "'Late Night Boys And Girls Club RP'",
      "'Special Forces Simulator''",
      "'Squid Game'",
      "'Shoot down planes\u2026because why not?'",
      "When we asked whether he thought they were appropriate, he said he puts his faith in the platform's age rating systems.",
      "\"One thing that's really important for the way we do things here, is it's not just on the title of the experience, it's literally on the content of the experience as well,\" he says.",
      "He insists that when Roblox rates experience, they go through rigorous guidelines and that the company has a \"consistent policy\" on that.",
      "How can you keep your child safe online?",
      "Plan to make phone use safer for teens watered down",
      "Mr Baszucki founded the platform with Eric Cassel in 2004 and released it to the public in 2006 \u2013 a year before the first Apple iPhone appeared, heralding the start of the smartphone era.",
      "Mr Baszucki describes his younger self as \"less of a gamer, and more of an engineer\", and the pair's first company was an education software provider called Knowledge Revolution. But they soon noticed that kids weren't only using the product to do their homework.",
      "\"They wanted to play and build stuff. They were making houses or ships or scenery, and they wanted to jump in, and all of that learning was the germination of Roblox,\" he says.",
      "The name Roblox was a mash-up of the words \"robot\" and blocks\" \u2013 and it stuck. The platform grew quickly in popularity \u2013 and there were also early warning signs of its future issues.",
      "Mr Cassel noticed some players \"starting to act out\" and not always behaving in a \"civilised\" way a couple of months after it launched, recalls Mr Baszucki.",
      "He says the roots of building a \"trust and safety system\" therefore began \"very, very early\" and that in those earlier days there were four people acting as safety moderators.",
      "\"It kind of is what launched this safety civility foundation,\" he adds.",
      "But despite attracting decent numbers, it was a year later, when the firm launched its digital currency Robux, that it really started to make money.",
      "Players buy Robux and use it to purchase accessories and unlock content. Content creators now get 70% of the fee, and the store operates on dynamic pricing, meaning popular items cost more.",
      "Mr Baszucki says there was some initial resistance among the leadership team about Roblox becoming more than a hobby for its players, with the introduction of a digital economy.",
      "Robux stayed, and the firm is now worth $41bn (\u00a331bn).",
      "Its share price has fluctuated since it went public in 2021, but overall Roblox shares are worth about one third more than they were six months ago, at the time of writing. Like many big tech firms its value peaked during Covid, when lockdowns meant millions of people were indoors.",
      "Mr Baszucki compares his experience of building Roblox with how Walt Disney may have felt about his creations.",
      "He describes his job as \"a little like having the opportunity he had a long time ago when he was designing the Magic Kingdom\", and is focused on Roblox's ongoing evolution into a Metaverse-style experience where people go about their daily lives in a virtual world, in avatar form.",
      "They have also been public in their ambitions to eventually attract 10% of the world's gamers.",
      "Asked to describe Roblox in three words, he replies: \"The future of communication.\"",

      "Deena Ghazarian had only been in business for a year when the trade policies of President Donald Trump's first term of office sent her company into a tailspin.",
      "It was 2019 and her California-based firm, Austere, had just agreed to supply several big US retailers with its high-end audio and video accessories that are largely manufactured in China.",
      "Then Trump imposed sweeping tariffs on China, and overnight Deena found herself paying a 25% surcharge on every cable and component she imported \u2013 up from zero previously.",
      "She was forced to absorb the costs and for a while thought she would go bust.",
      "\"I literally thought I am going to start and end a business in less than a year,\" she says. \"I had spent all this time, money and effort, and to have something like this blindside you was shocking.\"",
      "The firm pulled through, but like numerous other US businesses it now finds itself in a strikingly similar situation.",
      "Since returning to office in January, Mr Trump has raised tariffs on all goods imported from China by 20%, and put taxes of 25% on Canadian and Mexican products, only to delay some of them until April.",
      "The president says he wants to force these countries to do more to stop flows of illegal drugs and migrants into America, to bring more manufacturing back to the US, and to address what he sees as unfair trade imbalances.",
      "But the duties are much broader in scope than last time, when they were phased in gradually and many products were granted exemptions.",
      "Goods like smartphones, desktop computers and tablets are now incurring tariffs for the first time, while taxes on others have climbed higher.",
      "\"US importers have to pay these taxes not the exporters,\" says Ed Brzytwa, vice president of international trade at the Consumer Technology Association (CTA), a North American trade body that represents more than 1,200 tech firms.",
      "\"It's American businesses and consumers who will suffer.\"",
      "Businesses like Ms Ghazarian's are particularly exposed. China is still the number one supplier of electronic products to the US, with imports totalling $146bn (\u00a3112bn) in 2023, according to official data.",
      "Meanwhile, 87% of US video game console imports came from China that year, 78% of smartphones, 79% of laptops and tablets, and two-thirds of monitors, says the CTA.",

      "'I will have to raise prices by 10%' - toymakers warn of tariff pain",
      "China retaliates against US tariffs - but it also wants to talk",
      "While many American companies like Austere have diversified their supply chains away from China since Mr Trump's first term, countries such as Thailand, Taiwan and Vietnam still do not offer the same manufacturing capabilities and expertise.",
      "At the same time, the US president is now targeting Mexico - another major electronics supplier. And while domestic manufacturing in the US has increased, partly due to tariffs, it is still limited by higher costs and stricter regulations.",
      "\"Yes, Apple now makes some iPhones in India and [the Taiwanese chipmaker] TSMC has been diversifying to Arizona,\" says Mary Lovely, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute in Washington DC.",
      "\"But China is still a massive part of the supply chain. Relationships with new suppliers take time to develop, they are costly to develop.\"",
      "Research suggests that companies pass on a large proportion of the costs of tariffs by putting up prices. Earlier this month Corie Barry, boss of US electronics retailer Best Buy, said that the \"the vast majority\" of the new tariffs will \"probably be passed on to the consumer\" because vendors in the industry have such small margins.",
      "In February, Taiwanese firm Acer said the price of its laptops would likely rise by 10% based on the 10% duties in place on China at the time, while US group HP has warned its profits would be lower because of the tariffs.",
      "Ms Ghazarian says she may have to raise her prices this year, but worries it could backfire. \"There is a price point where the customer is satisfied with the value of goods provided.",
      "\"The moment I shift above that I start to lose customers. High inflation has squeezed Americans.\"",
      "During Mr Trump's first term, companies such as Apple successfully secured exemptions for products, and we may yet see carve-outs.",
      "Insiders have also suggested Mr Trump views tariffs as a negotiating tactic and could ease them if he wins concessions, as he did when China agreed to buy more American goods in a deal reached in 2020.",
      "Fears of a US economic slowdown could also make him change course.",
      "For the time being, though, tensions look likely to escalate. China, Mexico and Canada have vowed to retaliate against any US duties imposed on them, and this week Mr Trump threatened to double tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminium only to row back at the last minute.",
      "He plans to impose \"reciprocal tariffs\" on the rest of the world soon, and threatened tariff increases of up to 60% on Chinese goods while on the campaign trail.",
      "There is a risk this could drive up the price of tech goods around the world if China is forced to relocate manufacturing to countries where labour costs are higher. Moreover, countries may hit back with tariffs on imported US technology.",
      "Ms Ghazarian says she is worried but at least she's prepared this time. Like many other US business-owners she bulk-ordered extra inventory before Mr Trump took office, and is storing it in her east coast warehouse.",
      "She hopes that will get the company through the next year until it can \"pivot\" again.",

      "This vote is a historic move for traditionally debt-shy Germany, and could be hugely significant for Europe, as Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine grinds on, and after US President Donald Trump signalled an uncertain commitment to Nato and Europe's defence.",
      "However, state government representatives in the upper house, the Bundesrat, still need to approve the moves - also by a two-thirds majority - before they officially become law. That vote is set for Friday.",
      "Friedrich Merz, the man behind these plans and who is expected to soon be confirmed as Germany's new chancellor, told the lower house during Tuesday's debate that the country had \"felt a false sense of security\" for the past decade.",
      "\"The decision we are taking today... can be nothing less than the first major step towards a new European defence community,\" he said, adding that it includes countries that are \"not members of the European Union\".",
      "Germany has long been cautious about defence spending, not just for historical reasons dating back to 1945, but also due to the global debt crisis of 2009.",
      "But despite fears the vote would be tight, lawmakers in the end voted in favour of the changes by 513 to 207 - comfortably over the two-thirds majority required.",
      "One leading German newspaper described this vote as \"A day of destiny for our nation\".",
      "Under the measure, any spending on defence that amounts to more than 1% of Germany's GDP would no longer be subject to a limit on borrowing. Until now, this debt brake has been fixed at 0.35% of GDP.",
      "The change could transform the country's partially neglected armed forces in an era of great uncertainty for Europe.",
      "And this vote was not just about defence. It was also about freeing up \u20ac500bn for German infrastructure - fixing things like bridges and roads, but also to pay for climate change measures, something the Green Party insisted on.",
      "Merz, whose CDU party won Germany's general election last month, proposed the measures swiftly after the win.",
      "In an interview on Sunday he specifically mentioned fears that the US could pull back from defending Europe and Trump's talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin, saying that the \"situation has worsened in recent weeks\".",
      "\"That is why we have to act fast,\" Merz told public broadcaster ARD.",
      "It is a significant political win for Merz, who will, when he takes power as chancellor, now have access to hundreds of billions of euros to invest in the state - what some in Germany have called a \"fiscal bazooka\".",
      "It is also an important moment for Ukraine. The defence plans approved today by the Bundestag also allow spending on aid for states \"attacked in violation of international law\" to be exempt from the debt brake.",
      "That will enable outgoing Chancellor Olaf Scholz to release \u20ac3bn in aid to Ukraine as early as next week.",
      "Merz chose to push the changes through the old parliament, knowing the vote arithmetic was more favourable now than it would be after 25 March, when the new parliament session begins.",
      "The far-right AFD and far-left Linke, which both performed well in February's election, oppose Merz's plans.",
      "Merz has still not agreed a coalition deal to govern Germany after his election win, and has announced ambitious plans to have a government in place by Easter.",
      "Coalition negotiations in Germany, however, can drag on for months at a time."

    "summary": "The Nasa astronauts prepare to head to Earth after an eight-day mission turned into nine months.",
    "story": [
      "After an epic nine months in space, Nasa astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams are finally on their way home.",
      "Their stay on the International Space Station (ISS) was only supposed to last eight days, but their mission was dramatically extended after the spacecraft that they arrived on suffered technical problems.",
      "The pair are travelling back to Earth in a SpaceX capsule along with Nasa astronaut Nick Hague and Russian cosmonaut Aleksandr Gorbunov.",
      "They undocked from the ISS at 05:05 GMT (01:05 EDT) on Tuesday and are set to splash down off the coast of Florida later the same day, at 21:57 GMT (17:57 EDT) .",
      "Their landing time, however, could change if the weather conditions are not good enough.",
      "It will mark the end of a mission that has grabbed the world's attention, however the final stages of their journey won't be easy.",
      "The SpaceX Dragon capsule will make a fast and fiery re-entry through the Earth's atmosphere, enduring temperatures of up to 1600C.",
      "As it rapidly slows, the astronauts will experience significant g-forces, about four times the Earth's gravity.",
      "Finally, four large parachutes will open, allowing the craft to land gently in the ocean.",
      "Helen Sharman, Britain's first astronaut, said the thrilling ride would be worth it.",
      "\"They're experienced astronauts but they will feel fantastic to be back on Earth. The fresh air is the first thing that gets you,\" she told BBC News.",
      "How did Nasa's Suni and Butch fill nine months in space?",
      "Stranded astronauts heading back to Earth after nine months in space",
      "Nasa needs saving from itself \u2013 but is this billionaire right for that job?",
      "The saga of Butch and Suni began in June 2024.",
      "They were taking part in the first crewed test flight of the Starliner spacecraft, developed by aerospace company Boeing.",
      "But the capsule suffered several technical problems during its journey to the space station, and it was deemed too risky to take the astronauts home.",
      "Starliner returned safely to Earth empty in early September, but it meant the pair needed a new ride for their return.",
      "So Nasa opted for the next scheduled flight: a SpaceX capsule that arrived at the ISS in late September.",
      "It flew with two astronauts instead of four, leaving two seats spare for Butch and Suni's return. The only catch was this had a planned six month mission, extending the astronauts stay until now.",
      "The arrival of a replacement crew on Sunday was the final step needed for Butch and Suni's return \u2013 and after a short hand over with the new team, their mission is now at an end.",
      "The Nasa pair have embraced their longer than expected stay in space.",
      "They've carried out an array of experiments on board the orbiting lab and conducted spacewalks, with Suni breaking the record for the woman who's spent the most hours outside of the space station.",
      "And despite the astronauts being described as \"stranded\" they never really were.",
      "Throughout their mission there have always been spacecraft attached to the space station to get them - and the rest of those onboard - home if there was an emergency.",
      "Speaking in the weeks before their departure, Butch Wilmore said they weren't fazed when their mission was extended.",
      "\"We came up prepared to stay long, even though we plan to stay short. That's what we do in human space flight. That's what your nation's human space flight programme is all about,\" he said.",
      "Suni added that she was sad this would probably be her last mission.",
      "\"I think just the fact that we're living up here, in this very unique place, gives you an amazing perspective,\" she said. \"I don't want to lose that spark of inspiration when I leave, so I'm going to have to bottle it somehow.\"",
      "The pair's mission attracted even more publicity last month after SpaceX CEO Elon Musk said that the astronauts had been left in space for political reasons, and his company could have brought them home sooner.",
      "But Nasa officials said their decisions were based on flight scheduling and the space station's needs.",
      "Garrett Reisman, a former Nasa astronaut and former director of space operations at SpaceX, said there were good reasons why Nasa didn't opt for a dedicated rescue mission.",
      "\"It wasn't going to reduce the amount of time that Butch and Suni spent in space by very much - I mean, you'd shave a couple of months off, so the benefit wasn't that great,\" he told BBC News.",
      "\"And the cost was high - these crew missions cost hundreds of millions of dollars\u2026. I think Butch and Suni would have been the first ones to say 'no, that's not worth it'.\"",
      "Once the astronauts have arrived home, they will be taken to the Johnson Space Centre in Houston, Texas, where they will be checked over by medical experts.",
      "Long duration missions in space take a toll on the body, as astronauts lose bone density and suffer muscle loss. Blood circulation is also affected, and fluid shifts can also impact eyesight.",
      "It can take a long time for the body to return to normal, so the pair will be given an extensive exercise regime as their bodies re-adapt to living with gravity. But the first priority for Butch and Suni will be to see their families, friends - and pets.",
      "Garrett Reisman has been in touch with his friend Suni while she's been in space.",
      "\"I had an email from Suni just the other day where she talked about missing sitting on the porch in her house in Maine with the dogs, and smelling the fresh air, feeling the sun on your face,\" he told the BBC.",
      "\"It's the basic things about life here on Earth that you miss.\""

    "story": [
      "A group of scientists due to work together for months at a remote Antarctic research station has been rocked after a member of the team was accused of physical assault.",
      "A team of nine researchers were due to spend the Antarctic winter at the South African-run base, which sits about 170km (about 105 miles) from the edge of the ice shelf and is difficult to reach.",
      "But a spokesperson for the South African government told the BBC \"there was an assault\" at the station, following earlier allegations of inappropriate behaviour from inside the camp.",
      "In a further message seen by the BBC, the South African environment ministry said it was responding to the concerns with \"utmost urgency\".",
      "South Africa's Sunday Times, which was first to report the story, said members of the team had pleaded to be rescued.",
      "The ministry said that those in the team had been subject to \"a number of evaluations that include background checks, reference checks, medical assessment as well as a psychometric evaluation by qualified professionals\", which all members had cleared.",
      "In a subsequent statement, the ministry added that it was \"not uncommon\" for individuals to have an initial adjustment when they arrive at extremely remote areas even if assessments showed no areas of concern.",
      "It said when the vessel departed for Antarctica on 1 February \"all was in order\", and the incident was first reported to the ministry on 27 February.",
      "The statement added the department \"immediately activated the response plan in order to mediate and restore relations at the base\".",
      "\"This process has been ongoing on an almost daily basis in order to ensure that those on the base know that the Department is supportive and willing to do whatever is needed to restore the interpersonal relationships, but also firm in dealing with issues of discipline,\" it said.",
      "The department said allegations of sexual harassment were also being investigated, but that reports of sexual assault were incorrect.",
      "The department added that a government minister was personally handling the incident, and the alleged perpetrator had \"willingly participated in further psychological evaluation, has shown remorse and is willingly cooperative to follow any interventions that are recommended\".",
      "The alleged perpetrator has also written a formal apology to the victim, it said.",
      "The Sanae IV research base is located more than 4,000km from mainland South Africa and harsh weather conditions mean scientists can be cut off there for much of the year.",
      "The base typically houses staff who stay through the Antarctic winter for approximately 13 months.",
      "South African research expeditions have been taking place since 1959. The team to the Sanae IV base typically comprises a doctor, two mechanics, three engineers, a meteorological technician and a couple of physicists.",
      "These expeditions, with harsh weather conditions mandating a lot of time spent in a confined indoor space, normally run without incident.",
      "But on Sunday, South Africa's Sunday Times reported that one member of the team had sent an email warning of \"deeply disturbing behaviour\" by a colleague and an \"environment of fear\".",
      "A South African government spokesperson told the BBC that the alleged assault was triggered by \"a dispute over a task the team leader wanted the team to do \u2013 a weather dependant task that required a schedule change\".",
      "Incidents in Antarctica are rare, but not unprecedented. In 2018 there were reports of a stabbing at the Russian-operated Bellingshausen research station.",
      "Psychologists point to the effect that isolation can have on human behaviour.",
      "\"One thing we know from these rare occurrences, when something bad happens in enforced isolation or capsule working, is that it's often the small things, tiny things that can blow up into conflict,\" said Craig Jackson, professor of workplace health psychology at Birmingham City University, and a chartered member of the British Psychological Society.",
      "\"So issues about hierarchy, about workload allocation, even small things about leisure time or rations or food portions can rapidly flare up to become something much larger than they typically are,\" he told the BBC.",
      "Gabrielle Walker, a scientist and author who has been on expeditions to Antarctica, said working in such close proximity to a small group of colleagues had risks.",
      "\"You know exactly how they put their coffee cup down and what direction the handle points in; you know that they scratch their nose three times before they sit down; you know everything about them.",
      "\"And in the bad circumstances, it can start to irritate you\u2026 because there's nothing else \u2013 there's no other stimulus and you're with people 24/7,\" she said.",
      "Sources within the Antarctic research community have told the BBC that South Africa has access to an ice-capable ship and aircraft if needed.",
      "But any rescue operation would have to contend with the harsh climate, with temperatures well below freezing and the possibility of strong winds.",

    "story": [
      "Chinese state media has welcomed Donald Trump's move to cut public funding for  news outlets Voice of America and Radio Free Asia, which  have long reported on authoritarian regimes.",
      "The decison affects thousands of employees - some 1,300 staff have been put on paid leave at Voice Of America (VOA)  alone since Friday's executive order.",
      "Critics have called the move a setback for democracy but Beijing's state newspaper Global Times denounced VOA for its \"appalling track record\" in reporting on China and said it has \"now been discarded by its own government like a dirty rag\".",
      "The White House defended the move, saying it will \"ensure that taxpayers are no longer on the hook for radical propaganda\".",
      "Trump's cuts target the US Agency for Global Media (USAGM), which is supported by Congress and funds the affected news outlets, such as VOA, Radio Free Asia (RFA) and Radio Free Europe.",
      "They have won acclaim and international recognition for their reporting in places where press freedom is severely curtailed or non-existent, from China and Cambodia to Russia and North Korea.",
      "Although authorities in some of these countries block the broadcasts - VOA, for instance, is banned in China - people can listen to them on shortwave radio, or get around the restrictions via VPNs.",
      "RFA has often reported on the crackdown on human rights in Cambodia, whose former authoritarian ruler Hun Sen has hailed the cuts as a \"big contribution to eliminating fake news\".",
      "It was also among the first news outlets to report on China's network of detention centres in Xinjiang, where the authorities are accused of locking up hundreds of thousands of Uyghur Muslims without trial. Beijing denies the claims, saying people willingly attend \"re-education camps\" which combat \"terrorism and religious extremism\". VOA's reporting on North Korean defectors and the Chinese Communist Party's alleged cover-up of Covid fatalities has won awards.",
      "VOA, primarily a radio outlet, which also broadcasts in Mandarin, was recognised last year for its podcast on rare protests in 2022 in China against Covid lockdowns.",
      "But China's Global Times welcomed the cuts, calling VOA a \"lie factory\".",
      "\"As more Americans begin to break through their information cocoons and see a real world and a multi-dimensional China, the demonising narratives propagated by VOA will ultimately become a laughing stock,\" it said in an editorial published on Monday.",
      "Hu Xijin, who was the Global Times' former editor-in-chief, wrote: \"Voice of America has been paralysed! And so has Radio Free Asia, which has been as vicious to China. This is such great news.\"",
      "Such responses \"would have been easy to predict\", said Valdya Baraputri, a VOA journalist who lost her job over the weekend. She was previously employed by BBC World Service.",
      "\"Eliminating VOA, of course, allows channels that are the opposite of accurate and balanced reporting to thrive,\" she told the BBC.",
      "The National Press Club, a leading representative group for US journalists, said the order \"undermines America's long-standing commitment to a free and independent press\".",
      "Founded during World War Two in part to counter Nazi propaganda, VOA reaches some 360 million people a week in nearly 50 languages. Over the years it has broadcast in China, North Korea, communist Cuba and the former Soviet Union. It's also been a helpful tool for many Chinese people to learn English.",
      "VOA's director Michael Abramowitz said Trump's order has hobbled VOA while  \"America's adversaries, like Iran, China, and Russia, are sinking billions of dollars into creating false narratives to discredit the United States\".",
      "Ms Baraputri, who is from Indonesia but based in Washington DC, first joined VOA in 2018, but her visa was terminated at the end of Trump's first administration.",
      "She rejoined in 2023 because she wanted to be part of an organisation that \"upholds unbiased, factual reporting that is free from government influence\".",
      "The recent cuts have left her \"feeling betrayed by the idea I had about press freedom [in the US]\".",
      "She is also concerned for colleagues who may now be forced to return to hostile home countries, where they could be persecuted for their journalism.",
      "Meanwhile, the Czech Republic has appealed to the European Union to intervene so it can keep Radio Free Europe going.  It reports in 27 languages from 23 countries, reaching more than 47 million people every week.",
      "RFA chief executive Bay Fang said in a statement that the organisation plans to challenge the order. Cutting funding to these outlets is a \"reward to dictators and despots, including the Chinese Communist Party, who would like nothing better than to have their influence go unchecked in the information space\", he said.",
      "RFA started in 1996 and reaches nearly 60 million people weekly in China, Myanmar, North Korea, Cambodia, Vietnam and Laos. In China, it also broadcasts in minority languages like Tibetan and Uyghur, apart from English and Mandarin.",
      "\"[Trump's order] not only disenfranchises the nearly 60 million people who turn to RFA's reporting on a weekly basis to learn the truth, but it also benefits America's adversaries at our own expense,\" Mr Fang noted.",
      "While Chinese state media has celebrated the cuts, it's hard to know how Chinese people feel about it given their internet is heavily censored.",
      "Outside China, those who have listened to VOA and RFA over the years appear disappointed and worried.",
      "\"Looking back at history, countless exiles, rebels, intellectuals, and ordinary people have persisted in the darkness because of the voices of VOA and RFA, and have seen hope in fear because of their reports,\" Du Wen, a Chinese dissident living in Belgium, wrote on X.",

    "title": "Germany set to vote on historic increase in defence spending",
    "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvg102564g2o",
    "published": "Tue, 18 Mar 2025 01:00:24 GMT",
    "summary": "German MPs could pave the way for huge investments to defend Europe against a threatening Russia.",
    "story": [
      "What happens today, here in Berlin, will impact the entire future of Europe's defence and its ongoing support for Ukraine.",
      "Germany's Parliament, the Bundestag, is voting on whether to take the brakes off defence spending. This could pave the way for a massive uplift in military investment just as Russia makes gains in Ukraine and Washington signals that Europe can no longer rely on US protection.",
      "\"This vote in the Bundestag is absolutely crucial,\" says Prof Monika Schnitzer, who chairs Germany's Council of Economic Experts.",
      "\"After the Munich Security Conference, then the Trump-Zelensky row, Europe got a wake-up call. For the first time Europeans may not be able to rely on Washington. A lot of people had sleepless nights after that.\"",
      "\"The outlook for European defence spending hinges on developments in Germany, as the holder of the region's largest defence budget,\" agrees Dr Fenella McGerty, senior fellow for defence economics at the London-based International Institute for Strategic Studies.",
      "Defence spending in Germany rose by 23.2% last year, helping to drive a record 11.7% rise in European defence outlay.",
      "\"The remarkable initiatives announced in Germany are key to enabling further growth,\" adds Dr McGerty.",
      "\"Without them, any progress made on strengthening Germany's military capability may have stalled.\"",
      "Germany's incoming new Chancellor, Friedrich Merz, is in a race against time.",
      "The new parliament convenes on 25 March and not everyone is in favour of all this money being spent, especially on defence.",
      "Both the far-right AfD party and the far-left Linke have vowed to oppose it. The vote needs two-thirds in favour to go through, so Merz has a better chance of this happening today, under the existing (old) parliament. It then needs to be approved by Germany's upper house.",
      "Meanwhile Europe is still coming to terms with the shock of announcements coming from the Trump administration.",
      "At last month's Munich Security Conference I watched as delegates sat open-mouthed listening to US Vice-President JD Vance's blistering attack on Europe's policies on migration and free speech.",
      "This was preceded days earlier by US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth telling Nato members that America's 80-year-long defensive umbrella for Europe should no longer be taken for granted.",
      "Defence strategists in Europe are already planning for the unthinkable: a semi-victorious Russia making gains in Ukraine, then rebuilding its army and threatening Nato's eastern members, such as the Baltic states, within three years or less.",
      "This, at a time when the US commitment to Europe's defence is looking extremely shaky. President Trump is being urged by some in his circle to pull US troops out of Europe and even to withdraw from Nato altogether.",
      "Historical caution",
      "There is talk of France extending its national nuclear deterrent to cover other European nations.",
      "Meanwhile, most European governments are under pressure to raise defence spending after years of cuts.",
      "The British Army has now shrunk to its smallest size since the Napoleonic Wars, over 200 years ago, and experts predict it would run out of ammunition within two weeks of fighting a full-scale conventional war in Europe.",
      "Germany has long been cautious about defence spending, not just for historical reasons dating back to 1945, but also due to the global debt crisis of 2009.",
      "Which brings us back to today's crucial vote in the Bundestag. It is not just about defence. One part is about freeing up \u20ac500bn (\u00a3420bn) for German infrastructure \u2013 fixing things like bridges and roads, but also to pay for climate change measures, something the Green Party insisted on.",
      "The other part is about removing the restrictions in the constitution on borrowing that could, in theory, free up unlimited billions of euros for defence spending, both for Germany's armed forces and for a pan-European defence fund. On 4 March European Commission President Ursula Von der Leyen announced plans for an \u20ac800bn defence fund called The ReArm Europe Fund.",
      "The proposal being voted on in Berlin is that any spending on defence that amounts to more than 1% of Germany's GDP (national wealth) would no longer be subject to a limit on borrowing. Until now this debt ceiling has been fixed at 0.35 pct of GDP.",
      "Other countries will be watching closely to see if this proposal passes. If it does not, then the EU Commission's 'ReArm Europe' project could be off to a shaky start.",
      "The challenge today for Europe's security is a stark one. If the US no longer has its back, or at the very least cannot be relied upon to come to Europe's defence, then what does the continent need to do to fill the gap?",
      "Let's start with the numbers. According to the Kiel Institute, which meticulously tracks these things, Europe spends just 0.1% of its wealth on helping to defend Ukraine, while the US has been spending 0.15%.",
      "\"That means,\" says the Kiel Institute's Giuseppe Irto, \"that if Europe is to make up the shortfall then it needs to double its contribution to 0.21%.\"",
      "But regardless of what happens today in Berlin this is not just about money.",
      "Many of the most sought-after weapons in Ukraine's armoury have come from the US, like Patriot air defence and long-range artillery systems like Himars. The Kiel Institute puts the proportion of Ukraine's rocket artillery at 86% coming from the US, with 82% of its howitzer ammunition also being US-sourced.",
      "Then there is the whole question of US intelligence aid for Kyiv, much of it derived from satellites and geospatial imagery. If Washington were to permanently switch that off, then Ukrainian forces risk being partially blinded.",
      "If America's nuclear arsenal is taken out of the equation then there is a massive disparity between Russia's 5,000-plus warheads and the combined total of Britain and France's nukes which amount to less than a tenth of that. But that still theoretically leaves enough to act as a nuclear deterrent.",
      "Culture shift",
      "When it comes to \"conventional\", ie. non-nuclear arms, Western defence chiefs are fond of saying that Nato's combined forces are superior to Russia's.",
      "Maybe, but if there is one glaring lesson to come out of the Ukraine war it is that \"mass\" matters. Russia's army may be of poor quality but President Putin has been able to throw such huge numbers of men, drones, shells and missiles at Ukraine's front lines that the Russians are inexorably advancing, albeit slowly and at huge cost.",
      "This should not come as a surprise. Moscow put its economy on to a war footing some time ago. It appointed an economist as its defence minister and retooled many of its factories to churn out vast quantities of munitions, especially explosive-tipped drones.",
      "While many European nations have dragged their feet over raising defence spending much above the Nato-mandated 2% of GDP, Russia's is closer to 7%. Around 40% of Russia's national budget is spent on defence.",
      "So Europe has a fair bit of catching up to do if it is to even come close to shoring up its defence and security.",
      "\"If the vote passes then it will be significant for Germany and for Europe,\" says Ed Arnold, senior research fellow for European security at the Royal United Services Institute think tank.",
      "\"It will set a precedent and allow others to follow... However, three years on from the invasion of Ukraine the case of Germany is a reminder that more money for defence is necessary but not sufficient.",
      "\"Europe needs defence and security leaders who are able to navigate a rapidly deteriorating Euro-Atlantic security environment. Cultural, rather than financial reform, would be most valuable to Europe right now.\"",

      "The Jetstream 32 aircraft had taken off from the island's Juan Manuel G\u00e1lvez International Airport at 18:18 local time (00:18 GMT on Tuesday), and was bound for Golos\u00f3n International Airport in La Ceiba on the Honduran mainland.",

    "story": [
      "King Charles gave a warm welcome to the new Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney when he visited Buckingham Palace.",
      "It was another symbolic gesture of support for Canada from a King, wearing a red tie, who has to send coded signals rather than spell things out in words, as Canada faces threats from US President Donald Trump.",
      "But the King has sought to make clear his commitment to Canada - and if it had not been for his cancer diagnosis, the BBC understands he would have travelled there for an intended visit in 2024.",
      "There are also suggestions that once Canada's election is out the way, a visit to Canada will be a priority, where he can further demonstrate his support.",

      "The King congratulated Carney on becoming the new PM, ushering him to a seat, and perhaps hoping that the broken pin was not a symbol of a Commonwealth relationship under strain.",
      "\"These things are rather important,\" said the King, ahead of a 30-minute conversation with no one else in attendance.",
      "Carney later went on to meet UK prime minister Sir Keir Starmer at Downing Street.",

      "Carney said he was \"grateful for the welcomes and the constructive discussions\" with Starmer and French president Emmanuel Macron - whom he had met earlier in the day.",
      "At a news conference, he was asked if he felt let down by the lack of public support for Canada from other allies, given Trump's trade war with Canada, and his remarks about making Canada the 51st state of the US.",
      "\"We don't need another country to validate our sovereignty, we are sovereign, we don't need praise from another country, we are proud in and of ourselves,\" he said, adding that Sir Keir had made a point of referring to Canada's sovereignty and to \"our shared sovereign in King Charles III.\"",
      "Symbolic displays",
      "The meeting with Carney is the latest scene in an intricate diplomatic balancing act for a King who is head of state of both the UK and Canada.",
      "King Charles has to show solidarity with Canada without disrupting the UK's relationship with Trump.",
      "The King also has to avoid getting directly involved in politics - and has to speak on advice of ministers. Whatever he might personally believe about Trump's comments about taking over Canada, the King has to keep his thoughts to himself.",
      "Adding to this complicated choreography is that the royals are one of the strongest cards the UK can play with President Trump. He seemed delighted by his second state visit invitation from the King.",
      "So messages from the King are sent in symbolic displays. In case anyone missed the signs over Canada, there have been multiple moments. And then some more.",

      "A ceremonial sword for Canada became an event at Buckingham Palace with a formal presentation by the King.",
      "At a tree planting ceremony in Buckingham Palace, the tree chosen was a maple. And when the King sat down at the Commonwealth Service last week, it was on a Canadian chair.",
      "If any of these moments were accidental, they were not being rejected by Buckingham Palace, with royal sources emphasising the King's commitment to Canada.",
      "But there is no avoiding the tensions and contradictions in this balancing act. Emails from Canadians to the BBC's Royal Watch newsletter show that many want a much more robust defence from the King.",
      "\"What a cop out! Throw Canada to the wolves. Giving us back pats for our flag's anniversary doesn't quite cut it. Here sits a monarchist who is seriously rethinking his allegiance to the crown!\" emailed Brian, a Canadian military veteran.",
      "Carol in Vancouver was unhappy at the invitation from the UK for a second state visit by President Trump.",
      "\"I feel ashamed for the Brits feeling they have to follow through with inviting such a boor for dinner.  For the life of me I do not understand why he has this power over you,\" she wrote.",
      "\"As a Canadian, the invitation is a slap in the face to the people of Canada.  If the King is our King (as we are a Commonwealth country), and Trump is basically at war with us, how dare King Charles give him any credence?\" emailed Patricia.",
      "\"As a Canadian I am saddened, appalled, disgusted and angry that King Charles appears to be joining the conga line of supplicants,\" said Jo-Ann in Ontario.",
      "But King Charles will have to keep to the line set by ministers, and if that means maintaining good relations with Trump, he is unlikely to be saying anything more outspoken.",

    "story": [
      "A court in Georgia has handed a further prison sentence to the jailed former president, Mikheil Saakashvili.",
      "Saakashvili was sentenced on Monday to four-and-a-half years behind bars for illegally crossing the border when returning to the country from exile in 2021, his lawyer said.",
      "He is already serving concurrent terms for embezzlement and abuse of power while in office, bringing his total sentence to more than 12 years.",
      "Saakashvili has always denied wrongdoing and called his latest sentence \"illegal\" and \"unjust\". Rights groups say his imprisonment is politically motivated.",
      "Saakashvili opposes the governing Georgian Dream party, which favours closer ties with Russia. As president, he sought to forge closer relations with Western governments.",
      "In a video posted on X on Monday from the hospital where he is being held, Saakashvili said: \"No matter what, I will fight to the end.\"",
      "The former president was sentenced last week to nine years behind bars for embezzlement, running alongside the jail term he had already been serving. In 2018, he was tried in absentia and sentenced in two separate trials.",
      "Saakashvili was arrested in 2021 after making a surprise return to Georgia ahead of the country's local elections by smuggling himself into the country on a ferry from Ukraine.",
      "He called for mass anti-government demonstrations, but was quickly arrested by Georgian authorities.",
      "The 57-year-old had led Georgia over two terms between 2004 and 2013. Since leaving the country, he had for the most part lived in Ukraine.",
      "He was granted Ukrainian citizenship in 2015, renouncing his Georgian citizenship when he became governor of Ukraine's Odesa region.",
      "His citizenship was revoked in 2017 before being restored again by President Volodymyr Zelensky in 2019.",
      "\"This [sentence] is basically sending a message... to President Zelensky, for them to scare him to show what happens when you don't surrender your country... I did not surrender Georgia,\" Saakashvili said in his video address while wearing a black shirt with the words \"I'm Ukrainian\" emblazoned on it.",
      "Zelensky, who appointed Saakashvili to oversee reforms in Ukraine, has demanded his transfer to Kyiv.",

      "Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu overnight laid the blame at Hamas's door for the renewal of his deadly aerial campaign.",
      "The Israeli leader's statement said the military have been instructed to take \"strong action\" against Hamas following their \"repeated refusal to release our hostages\" as well as its rejection of US proposals.",
      "In local press, Israeli military sources have also talked about seeing an increase of Hamas activity to regroup their forces in recent days.",
      "While the truce mostly held until last night, officials at the Hamas-run Ministry of Health in Gaza have said that over 140 people have been killed by Israel in the two months since it came into effect in January.",
      "In recent weeks, the Israel military has said it's repeatedly struck targets they've identified as Hamas fighters posing a threat to its troops stationed in Gaza.",
      "But the reasons for Netanyahu's decision to return to attacking Hamas is a subject of contention.",
      "The Hostages and Missing Families Forum has accused the government of \"a complete deception\" by pulling out of a deal \"that could have brought everyone home.\"",
      "While some of the prime minister's most staunch critics suggest that the attacks are an attempt by Netanyahu to distract from damaging legal and political crises he faces closer to home.",

      "Israel and the Palestinians: History of the conflict explained",
      "What happened to ceasefire talks?",
      "The 19 January ceasefire deal was thrashed out over many months, with US, Qatari and Egyptian mediation, and a detailed three-phase plan for how the truce should move forward.",
      "The first phase saw Hamas release 33 hostages in return for Israel releasing around 1,900 Palestinian prisoners and allowing aid and other goods to enter the Gaza Strip.",
      "As the guns fell silent and thousands of displaced Gazans returned home, Hamas and Israel were due to begin negotiations to commence the second phase.",
      "The parties had agreed that the second phase negotiations would include the release of all remaining hostages as well as a full withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza Strip, leading to a permanent end to the war.",
      "The first phase finished on 1 March, but the negotiations for the next stage had made no progress.",
      "Instead, Israel imposed a total halt on all aid entering Gaza causing widespread international alarm - and said that it backed a new proposal put together by the United States.",
      "In Qatar last week, Israeli and Hamas delegations gathered to negotiate how the ceasefire would progress and US envoy Steve Witkoff put forward his new \"bridging proposal\" that would have extended the expired first phase.",
      "More hostages would return home in exchange for more Palestinian prisoners being released - but, crucially, negotiations over a permanent end to the war would be delayed.",
      "Here lies a central element to why the truce has broken down.",
      "Israel's two key objectives - to return the hostages and to defeat Hamas - aren't both fully achievable together.",
      "Hamas, to put it crudely, has one card to play in the negotiations: the hostages. They don't want to release any further hostages in a next stage of the ceasefire unless it entails Israeli troops beginning to withdraw from the Gaza Strip, as agreed in the original truce.",
      "Israel is resisting this. The new, US proposal is an attempt to retrieve more hostages while delaying a commitment to ending the war and the question over whether Hamas will remain in some form.",
      "In recent days, the US and Israel have cast Hamas's preference for sticking close to the terms of the original ceasefire deal - instead of renegotiating its terms - as a \"refusal\" to extend the ceasefire.",
      "Witkoff accused Hamas of \"publicly claiming flexibility while privately making demands that are entirely impractical without a permanent ceasefire.\"",
      "While, in late February, Israeli officials had already briefed local press that its military wouldn't withdraw from key sites in Gaza in a breach of the ceasefire agreement.",
      "While we cannot know the detail of the negotiation talks that have taken place behind closed doors - what we do know is that Israel halting aid entering Gaza 17 days ago was an attempt to force Hamas into offering new concessions.",
      "That hasn't worked so far and now it appears Israel has returned to violence in order to try to extract a new deal, one that is more favourable for its political leaders, and one that offers fewer wins to Hamas.",
      "From now on, the situation in Gaza is likely to look different to the past two months of the truce.",
      "This morning the Israeli military has published a map, ordering Palestinians to leave a huge area along the perimeter of the Gaza Strip, where no doubt thousands of Gazans had returned to.",
      "Hamas, for its part, has called for a halt to Israel's military operation and, at the time of writing, has not said it will return to fighting.",
      "However, a BBC journalist near the Israel Gaza border today was told by a soldier that a call has gone out for 40,000 reservists to the Israeli army to present for duty. This seems to confirm reports in Israeli press that the military has been preparing for a renewed ground invasion in the Gaza Strip.",
      "Pursuing a renewed campaign in Gaza also presents a political boon for Prime Minister Netanyahu. This morning the hard right Jewish Power party has announced it will return to the coalition, its members including, former minister Itamar Ben Gvir, resigned in protest over the ceasefire. Having their cooperation will be crucial for the government as it seeks to pass its current budget.",
      "Israel's operations last night may have been a one-off attempt to force Hamas to concede at the negotiating table. It may, however, also herald the beginning of a fierce wave of fighting on the ground again, alarming Gaza's weary families and concerned Israeli hostage families alike.",

      "Critically, he would not be able to pursue this action without prosecuting, or re-prosecuting the individuals who were given immunity, she argues.",
      "Legally challenging Biden's pardons because of autopen would also call into question other aspects of US governance that use automatic signatures, such as bills passed by Congress and signed into law by the president, she added.",
      "Professor Moran says that a president revoking his predecessor's pardon is extremely rare.",
      "\"Historically, the only example I'm aware of is towards the end of Andrew Johnson's presidency in the 1860s, when he issued some pardons which were revoked before they were accepted. But that's a very small number.",
      "\"If he [Trump] decides that he wants to go after the people who were pardoned, that will end up in the courts and then that would become the point where the constitution is really tested\", he said.",

      "The soldiers, who spoke over social media, were given aliases to protect their identity. Some gave accounts of a \"collapse\" as Ukraine lost Sudzha, the largest town it held.",
      "Ukrainian restrictions on travel to the front have meant it is not possible to get a full picture of the situation. But this is how five Ukrainian soldiers described to us what had happened.",
      "Volodymyr: 'Drones around the clock'",
      "On 9 March, \"Volodymyr\" sent a Telegram post to the BBC saying he was still in Sudzha, where there was \"panic and collapse of the front\".",
      "Ukrainian troops \"are trying to leave - columns of troops and equipment. Some of them are burned by Russian drones on the road. It is impossible to leave during the day.\"",
      "Movement of men, logistics and equipment had been reliant on one major route between Sudzha and Ukraine's Sumy region.",
      "Volodymyr said it was possible to travel on that road relatively safely a month ago. By 9 March it was \"all under the fire control of the enemy - drones around the clock. In one minute you can see two to three drones. That's a lot,\" he said.",
      "\"We have all the logistics here on one Sudzha-Sumy highway. And everyone knew that the [Russians] would try to cut it. But this again came as a surprise to our command.\"",
      "At the time of writing, just before Russia retook Sudzha, Volodymyr said Ukrainian forces were being pressed from three sides.",

      "\"A few days ago, we received an order to leave the defence lines in an organised retreat,\" he said, adding that Russia had amassed a significant force to retake the town, \"including large numbers of North Korean soldiers\".",
      "Military experts estimate Russia had amassed a force of up to 70,000 troops to retake Kursk \u2013 including about 12,000 North Koreans.",
      "Russia had also sent its best drone units to the front and was using kamikaze and first-person-view (FPV) variants to \"take fire control of the main logistics routes\".",
      "They included drones linked to operators by fibre-optic wires - which are impossible to jam with electronic counter-measures.",
      "Maksym said as a result \"the enemy managed to destroy dozens of units of equipment\", and that wrecks had \"created congestion on supply routes\".",
      "Anton: The catastrophe of retreat",
      "The situation on that day, 11 March, was described as \"catastrophic\" by \"Anton\".",
      "The third soldier spoken to by the BBC was serving in the headquarters for the Kursk front.",
      "He too highlighted the damage caused by Russian FPV drones. \"We used to have an advantage in drones, now we do not,\" he said. He added that Russia had an advantage with more accurate air strikes and a greater number of troops.",
      "Anton said supply routes had been cut. \"Logistics no longer work \u2013 organised deliveries of weapons, ammunition, food and water are no longer possible.\"",
      "Anton said he managed to leave Sudzha by foot, at night \u2013 \"We almost died several times. Drones are in the sky all the time.\"",
      "The soldier predicted Ukraine's entire foothold in Kursk would be lost but that \"from a military point of view, the Kursk direction has exhausted itself. There is no point in keeping it any more\".",
      "Western officials estimate that Ukraine's Kursk offensive involved about 12,000 troops. They were some of their best-trained soldiers, equipped with Western-supplied weapons including tanks and armoured vehicles.",
      "Russian bloggers published videos showing some of that equipment being destroyed or captured. On 13 March, Russia said the situation in Kursk was \"fully under our control\" and that Ukraine had \"abandoned\" much of its material.",
      "Dmytro: Inches from death",
      "In social media posts on 11-12 March, a fourth soldier, \"Dmytro\" likened the retreat from the front to \"a scene from a horror movie\".",
      "\"The roads are littered with hundreds of destroyed cars, armoured vehicles and ATVs (All Terrain Vehicles). There are a lot of wounded and dead.\"",
      "Vehicles were often hunted by multiple drones, he said.",
      "He described his own narrow escape when the car he was travelling in got bogged down. He and his fellow soldiers were trying to push the vehicle free when they were targeted by another FPV drone.",
      "It missed the vehicle, but injured one of his comrades. He said they had to hide in a forest for two hours before they were rescued.",
      "Dmytro said many Ukrainians retreated on foot with \"guys walking 15km to 20km\". The situation, he said, had turned from \"difficult and critical to catastrophic\".",
      "In a message on 14 March, Dmytro added: \"Everything is finished in the Kursk region... the operation was not successful.\"",
      "He estimated that thousands of Ukrainian soldiers had died since the first crossing into Russia in August.",
      "Artem: 'We fought like lions'",
      "A fifth soldier sounded less gloomy about the situation. On 13 March, \"Artem\" sent a Telegram message from a military hospital, where he was being treated for shrapnel wounds suffered in a drone attack.",
      "Artem said he had been fighting further west \u2013 near the village of Loknya, where Ukrainian forces were putting up a stiff resistance and \"fighting like lions\".",
      "He believed the operation had achieved some success.",
      "\"It's important that so far the Armed Forces of Ukraine have created this buffer zone, thanks to which the Russians cannot enter Sumy,\" he said.",
      "What now for Ukraine's offensive?",
      "Ukraine's top general, Oleksandr Syrskyi, insists that Ukrainian forces have pulled back to \"more favourable positions\", remain in Kursk, and would do so \"for as long as it is expedient and necessary\".",
      "He said Russia had suffered more than 50,000 losses during the operation - including those killed, injured or captured.",
      "However, the situation now is very different to last August. Military analysts estimate two-thirds of the 1,000 sq km gained at the outset have since been lost.",
      "Any hopes that Ukraine would be able to trade Kursk territory for some of its own have significantly diminished.",
      "Last week, President Volodymyr Zelensky said he believed the Kursk operation had \"accomplished its task\" by forcing Russia to pull troops from the east and relieve pressure on Pokrovsk.",
      "But it is not yet clear at what cost."

    "summary": "The prime minister hopes to achieve solid support as he visits the UK and France, writes Lyse Doucet.",
    "story": [
      "Two European politicians, dressed symbolically in red and white, sent a message last week to Canada on social media declaring \"we've got your back\".",
      "Also signalling support was King Charles, who planted a red maple tree on the grounds of Buckingham Palace and wore his Canadian medals during a high-profile visit to a naval warship.",
      "Canada's new Prime Minister Mark Carney has arrived in Paris before heading to London on Monday - a day after his 60th birthday - for his first foreign visit hoping to achieve more than symbolic encouragement. He wants solid support from allies.",
      "Not only is Canada being targeted, like Europe, by a raft of swingeing US tariffs, but Donald Trump is making it clear he wants to take over his northern neighbour.",
      "\"We appreciate all the symbolic gestures but we need more public backing,\" a Canadian official told me in a voice which underlined the nervous disbelief shared by most Canadians \u2013 Trump is not joking when he calls Canada the United States's \"51st state\".",
      "The official messaging from Ottawa about Carney's trip underlines his priorities - finance and fortifying security \u2013 a natural fit for the economist who headed the central banks in both Canada and the UK. A statement from his office said his visit is meant \"to strengthen two of our closest and longest-standing economic and security partnerships\".",
      "His itinerary is full of great symbolism too.",
      "Carney revealed it on Friday during his first speech as prime minister when he hearkened back - with a shiny polish -  to the origins of this former colony. He hailed \"the wonder of a country built on the bedrock of three peoples: indigenous, French and British\".",
      "So there's a third destination on this whistle-stop tour \u2013 Iqaluit, the capital of Canada's northernmost territory of Nunavut and homeland of its Inuit people. That stop, the statement emphasised, was to \"reaffirm Canada's Arctic security and sovereignty\".",
      "Spectacular Arctic and northern terrain makes up 40% of the land mass of the world's second largest country. Protecting it is a critical Canadian concern in the midst of intensifying rivalry among world powers in the Arctic region, which has drawn in the US, Russia, China and more; it's the cold war of all cold wars.",
      "And there's a personal twist. Carney was born in the small town of Fort Smith in the Northwest Territories, which lies next to Nunavut.",
      "His schedule underlines that he also needs to be a quick study in a new skill - retail politics. A federal election, which has to be held by October, is expected to be called very soon. Carney needs to prove that he can engage with voters, in English and French, as naturally as he does with bankers and finance bosses.",
      "And he needs a proper political mandate. He secured a whopping 86% of the vote when his Liberal Party chose to replace Justin Trudeau, who stepped down as prime minister amid growing calls to resign from his own party after a decade at the top.",
      "But Carney doesn't have a seat in parliament; he still doesn't have the vote of Canadians.",
      "His Liberal party has just experienced a dramatic reversal, a \"Trump bump\" as well as a Trudeau one. The party which seemed certain to lose, and lose badly, is now tied with its main Conservative rivals in the polls.",
      "Looking like a world leader, and understanding the world of tariffs and trade, is a good look when you are running for high office in the dark shadow of an external threat.",
      "\"I think part of the purpose of Mark Carney's trip to Europe is to show that he can talk internationally to other like-minded powers at this very important moment,\" reflects the eminent Canadian historian Margaret MacMillan.",
      "Back home, voters will decide if that is what counts.",
      "Carney is certain to talk Trump tactics, in private, with France's President Emmanuel Macron and Britain's Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer. They've both taken great pains to flatter the US president in public, and press their case behind closed doors.",

      "Watch: Trump and Macron's history of intense handshakes",
      "Watch: Trump and Macron's history of intense handshakes",
      "Canada's new top talker has been talking tough.",
      "A week ago, when Carney won his party's leadership contest, he invoked Canada's national sport, ice hockey, which has long been locked in rivalry with US teams. \"Canadians are always ready when someone else drops the gloves,\" Carney declared to rousing applause.",
      "\"Make no mistake, Canada will win.\"",
      "But everyone knows this is no game. Carney described this escalating trade war as \"the greatest crisis of our lifetime\". More than 80% of Canada's exports cross the border to the US.",
      "And while there have been a few reports of Canadians flying the US flag, a recent poll by the Angus Reid Institute underlined that a thumping 91% of Canadians reject becoming the 51st state.",
      "Canada says too little, too late as Trump flip-flops on tariffs",
      "Canada says too little, too late as Trump flip-flops on tariffs",
      "On Friday, in Ottawa's icy cold weather, Carney struck a warmer tone, highlighting how he and Trump share a background in business, including real estate.",
      "\"The president is a successful businessperson and dealmaker. We are his largest client in so many industries,\" he remarked. \"Clients expect respect and working together in a proper commercial way.\"",
      "Carney says he \"looks forward\" to speaking with President Trump. But the fact it will be a call, not a visit, is a measure of this moment. Traditionally, the first foreign visit of a Canadian leader is to the US - its closest neighbour and most trusted partner.",
      "On Monday, Carney is expected to sit down with King Charles, Canada's head of state. The British monarch recently expressed his \"deepest affection\" for Canada, and is said to have already penned a private letter to the new prime minister.",
      "In his non-political role, showing love in public may be the limits of the King's power. But even that sends a message to the American president.",
      "Sir Keir has described Canada as \"an ally, and a very important ally too\". But last week, the head of Britain's Liberal Democrats Ed Davey called on him to show more public support for Canada to oppose the \"shocking attacks\" on its sovereignty.",

      "What is the act?",
      "The Alien Enemies Act grants the president of the United States sweeping powers to order the detention and deportation of natives or citizens of an \"enemy\" nation without following the usual processes.",
      "It was passed as part of a series of laws in 1798 when the US believed it would enter a war with France.",
      "The act states that \"whenever there shall be a declared war [...] or any invasion or predatory incursion shall be perpetrated, attempted, or threatened\" against the US, all \"subjects of the hostile nation or government\" could be \"apprehended, restrained, secured and removed, as alien enemies\".",
      "When else has it been used?",
      "The act has only been previously used three times - all during times of conflict involving the US.",
      "It was last invoked in World War Two, when people of Japanese descent - reportedly numbering about 120,000 - were imprisoned without trial. Thousands were sent to internment camps.",
      "People of German and Italian ancestry were also interned during that time.",
      "Before that, the act was used during the War of 1812 and World War One.",

      "Though this is the first time the act has been used by Trump, it is not the first time he has mentioned it.",
      "At his inaugural address in January, he said he would invoke the act to \"eliminate the presence of all foreign gangs and criminal networks bringing devastating crime to US soil\".",
      "In his proclamation on Saturday, Trump invoked the wording of the act by accusing TdA of threatening an \"invasion\" against the US. He declared its members \"liable to be apprehended, restrained, secured, and removed as alien enemies\".",
      "Trump's decision has been criticised by rights groups. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) sued to stop the removals on the grounds that the US was not at war.",
      "Speaking to BBC News on Sunday, Lee Gelernt, a lawyer with the ACLU, said: \"There's no question in our mind that the law is being violated.\"",
      "A federal judge attempted to stop the use of the law to carry out the deportations, but the White House said this had had \"no lawful basis\", and that the removals had already taken place.",
      "Reacting to a news article covering the judge's order, El Salvador's President Nayib Bukele wrote on social media: \"Oopsie... Too late.\"",
      "Venezuela criticised Trump's use of the act, saying it \"unjustly criminalises Venezuelan migration\" and \"evokes the darkest episodes in the history of humanity, from slavery to the horror of the Nazi concentration camps\".",
      "Katherine Yon Ebright, counsel at the Brennan Center for Justice, said in a statement that Trump's use of the Alien Enemies Act was illegal.",
      "\"The only reason to invoke such a power is to try to enable sweeping detentions and deportations of Venezuelans based on their ancestry, not on any gang activity that could be proved in immigration proceedings\", she added."

      "How did the gang start?",
      "Tren de Aragua was originally a prison gang that Hector Guerrero Flores turned into a \"transnational criminal organisation\", according the US state department, which is offering a reward of $5m for information that could lead to his arrest.",
      "Guerrero Flores, 41, was in and out of Tocor\u00f3n for more than a decade.",
      "He escaped in 2012 by bribing a guard and was then rearrested in 2013. Upon his return, he transformed the prison into a leisure complex.",
      "And he expanded the gang's influence far beyond the jail's gates, seizing control of gold mines in Bolivar state, drug corridors on the Caribbean coast, and clandestine border crossings between Venezuela and Colombia, according to the US state department.",
      "The gang's name translates as \"Train of Aragua\", and it may have come from a railroad workers' union. Aragua, on Venezuela's Caribbean coast, is one of the country's 23 states.",
      "Luis Izquiel, a criminology professor at the Central University of Venezuela, told the BBC that the union controlled a section of the railway that crossed Aragua and would extort contractors and sell jobs on work sites.",
      "Tren de Aragua has under Guerrero Flores's leadership expanded into Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and Chile and diversified from extorting migrants into sex-trafficking, contract killing and kidnapping.",
      "How big is the gang?",
      "By most accounts, Tren de Aragua spread out of Venezuela when the country entered a humanitarian and economic emergency in 2014 that made crime less profitable, and now is believed to have nodes in eight other countries, including the US.",
      "The group, in part, operates by forming alliances and partnerships with local criminal organisations.",
      "In Ecuador, for example, the gang is believed to work with groups loosely affiliated with Mexico's Sinaloa cartel, while in Colombia some have alleged that they have worked with members of the left-wing National Liberation Army guerrilla group, or ELN.",
      "Ronna R\u00edsquez, a journalist who has written the definitive book on the group, estimated last year that the organisation has 5,000 members and annual profits of between $10m and $15m.",
      "Others have estimated its membership at roughly half that figure.",
      "A prosecutor in Chile has called Tren de Aragua a \"brutal organisation\" that uses murder and torture to achieve its aims.",

      "On Saturday, Trump invoked the 18th Century Alien Enemies Act as he accused Tren de Aragua of \"perpetrating, attempting, and threatening an invasion of predatory incursion against the territory of the United States\".",
      "He said the gang was engaged in \"irregular warfare\" against the US at the direction of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro.",
      "Shortly after taking office in January, Trump also declared Tren de Aragua a foreign terrorist organisation, placing the group in the same category as the Islamic State and Boko Haram, Nigeria's Islamist militants.",

    "story": [
      "The dramatic political developments in Bangladesh that led to prime minister Sheikh Hasina being ousted last year have thrown up many surprises - including Dhaka's growing closeness with one-time foe Pakistan.",
      "Last month, after decades of troubled relations, the two countries began directly trading for the first time, with Dhaka importing 50,000 tonnes of rice from Pakistan. Direct flights and military contacts have also been revived, visa procedures have been simplified, and there are reports of co-operation on security matters.",
      "The countries - separated by the landmass of India - have deep, painful historical ties. The animosity between them goes back to 1971, when Bangladesh - then known as East Pakistan - launched a struggle to gain independence from Islamabad. India supported the Bengali rebels during the nine-month war which led to the formation of Bangladesh.",
      "While the scars from that period run deep, Dhaka had cordial relations with Islamabad between 2001 and 2006, when a coalition of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) and the Jamaat-e-Islami governed the country.",
      "This changed during Hasina's 15-year rule from 2009 - when she was strongly backed by Delhi and maintained a distance from Pakistan. But after she fled to India following mass protests against her government, ties seem to be thawing.",
      "\"For the past 15 years, the Pakistan-Bangladesh relationship was on a slightly difficult trajectory,\" says Humayun Kabir, a former senior Bangladeshi diplomat, adding that the relationship seems to now be returning to that of \"two normal neighbours\".",
      "The developments are being watched closely, particularly in India, which has a long history of hostile relations with Pakistan.",
      "Relations between Dhaka and Delhi have been frosty since Hasina's exit. India has not reacted to Bangladesh's demands to extradite her to face charges of crimes against humanity, money laundering and corruption. Hasina denies the accusations against her.",
      "Some experts think the reviving of relations between Dhaka and Islamabad is a strategic move.",
      "\"Pakistan and Bangladesh have a tactical relationship at the moment. Together, they want to represent a pushback against the dominance of India,\" says Ayesha Siddiqa, a Pakistani academic who is a senior fellow at King's College in London.",
      "There have been other developments apart from starting direct trade.",
      "Muhammad Yunus, head of the interim Bangladesh government, met Pakistan's Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif at multilateral forums several times in recent months.",
      "And then there is a growing military relationship.",
      "A high-level Bangladeshi military delegation made a rare visit to Pakistan in January and held talks with influential army chief General Asim Munir. The Bangladeshi navy also participated in a multinational maritime exercise organised by Pakistan off the Karachi coast in February. .",
      "Veena Sikri, who was India's high commissioner to Bangladesh between 2003 and 2006, describes the growing closeness between Dhaka and Islamabad as a \"d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu\" moment.",
      "During her tenure in Dhaka, she said, India repeatedly raised the issue of \"Indian insurgents getting trained inside Bangladesh with the support of the ISI [Pakistan's intelligence agency] and a section of the Bangladeshi military\".",
      "\"We even provided evidence to Bangladeshi authorities,\" she said.",
      "Authorities in Pakistan and Bangladesh denied these allegations at the time.",
      "The long, porous border between India and Bangladesh makes it relatively easy for armed insurgent groups from India's north-eastern states to cross over from Bangladesh. But, after Hasina's Awami League came to power in 2009, it cracked down on these groups and dismantled their bases.",
      "So the revival of military ties between Bangladesh and Pakistan is \"a major security concern for India\", says Ms Sikri.",
      "\"It's not just the military relationship. The Pakistani establishment is also reviving ties with Bangladeshi Islamist parties like the Jamaat-e-Islami, which supported Islamabad during Bangladesh's independence war,\" she adds.",
      "The Yunus administration's press office has flatly rejected Indian media reports that senior ISI officials have visited Dhaka. It has also described reports that claim Pakistani operatives were working to reopen a camp of an Indian insurgent group in Bangladesh as \"baseless\".",
      "Pakistan's military did not respond to BBC questions on India's concerns over the future role of the ISI in Bangladesh.",
      "Analysts say Bangladeshi politicians are aware that, given the close economic and linguistic ties, Dhaka cannot afford to take an anti-India stance.",
      "And despite apprehensions in Delhi, Bangladeshi diplomats argue that ties with Pakistan cannot be normalised unless issues related to the 1971 war are resolved.",
      "During the war, hundreds of thousands of Bengalis were killed and tens of thousands of women were raped. The war ended with more than 90,000 Pakistani security and civilian personnel surrendering to the joint command of Indian and Bangladeshi forces in what is seen as a humiliating chapter in Islamabad.",
      "Bangladesh has demanded a formal apology from Pakistan for the atrocities committed during the war but Islamabad has shown no inclination to do so.",
      "\"Pakistan needs to own the crimes that had taken place during the independence war,\" said Mr Kabir, the former Bangladeshi diplomat. \"We had also raised the issue of the division of pre-1971 assets between the two nations in several bilateral meetings with Pakistan.\"",
      "Even former Pakistani military officers like Ikram Sehgal accept that \"the main stumbling block in bilateral ties is the requirement of the Bangladeshis that Pakistanis should apologise for what happened in 1971\".",
      "However, the retired Pakistan army major insists that Bangladesh should also address the issue of attacks by Bengalis on Urdu speakers during the struggle for independence.",
      "\"I was a witness to the atrocities that took place against the Urdu-speaking Bihari people [in East Pakistan],\" Mr Sehgal, who now lives in Karachi, told the BBC.",
      "While history casts a shadow over ties between Dhaka and Islamabad, economists point out the two countries can first focus on improving bilateral trade, which currently stands at less than $700m (\u00a3540m), mostly in favour of Pakistan.",
      "\"Pakistan's more than 250 million population is a solid market for Bangladesh in the medium to long term,\" says Sabrin Beg, an associate professor of economics at the University of Delaware.",
      "Currently, there are constraints including high tariffs on both sides and businesses and exporters face visa and travel obstacles, she points out. However, Ms Beg says \"improved bilateral political and trade relations will ease these constraints\".",
      "Some of these issues may be discussed during Pakistani foreign minister Ishaq Dar's visit to Dhaka in April. By the end of the year Bangladesh is expected to hold general elections and a new government may have a different set of foreign policy priorities.",

    "summary": "Despite dire predictions of climate breakdown, more Sports Utility Vehicles are being spotted on, and off, the roads.",
    "story": [
      "Across the globe more and more Sports Utility Vehicles (SUVs) are being spotted on \u2013 and off \u2013 the roads.",
      "This is despite predictions from the United Nations of an inevitable pivot towards smaller and more environmentally friendly vehicles because of the urgency of the climate crisis and the rising cost of living.",
      "That pivot has not materialised: globally, 54% of the cars sold in 2024 were SUVs, including petrol, diesel, hybrids and electric makes. This is an increase of three percentage points from 2023 and five percentage points from the year before, according to GlobalData.",
      "Of the SUVs which are now on the road \u2013 both new and older models \u2013 95% are burning fossil fuels, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA).",
      "Manufacturers, however, say their new fleets of such cars are increasingly becoming electric, and that not all SUVs now being sold cause an increase in emissions.",
      "SUVs are hard to miss. They are heavy and larger with spacious interiors, higher ground clearance and a high driving position with a better view of the road, although smaller versions are also on the market.",
      "Environmental campaigners such as Greenpeace see SUVs as one of the villains of the climate crisis and argue that their manufacturing consumes significant resources given their size.",
      "Experts also say they require larger batteries to power their electric versions, which then further increases the demand for critical minerals, putting even more pressure on the planet.",
      "Momentum was thought to be with smaller, energy-efficient electric vehicles. But the sales of standard-sized electric vehicles (EVs) has actually decreased in major markets such as Japan and Germany, and their sales growth has slowed in India.",
      "And in Europe, sales of SUVs have outpaced those of EVs despite indications more than half a decade ago of an opposite trend. In Europe in 2018, 3.27 million small hatchbacks \u2013 both those powered by fossil fuels and those by electricity \u2013 were sold while 2.13 million were sold in 2024, according to GlobalData.",
      "Its sales forecast manager Sammy Chan said: \"This is partly because of the SUV alternatives being offered in smaller [sizes] whose sales in Europe have now grown to nearly to 2.5 million in 2024 from 1.5 million in 2018.\"",
      "China saw the largest sales of nearly 11.6 million SUVs in 2024 followed by the US, India and Germany, according to GlobalData.",
      "What is driving this SUV growth?",
      "Industry experts say people's purchasing power has been improving in many fast-emerging economies, making SUVs the likelier choice of car.",
      "\"Manufacturers respond to consumer demand and, increasingly, drivers are attracted to dual purpose vehicles given their practicality, comfort and good view of the road,\" said Mike Hawes who is the chief executive of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT).",
      "Automobile industry analysts also say that manufacturers are attracted to high profit margins from SUVs: they can make more money from SUVs even though they make fewer vehicles.",
      "\"It is the industry that has driven the demand through huge marketing and advertising campaigns in recent years,\" said Dudley Curtis, the communications manager at the European Transport Safety Council.",
      "\"SUVs offered the industry a simple way of charging more for a vehicle that does the same thing [as others],\" he said.",
      "Are SUVs an issue?",
      "Because of the robust growth in SUVs sales, the IEA says oil consumption of these  vehicles has increased by 600,000 barrels per day globally between 2022 and 2023, accounting for more than a quarter of the total annual rise in global oil demand.",
      "\"If ranked among countries, the global fleet of SUVs would be the world's fifth largest emitter of CO2, exceeding the emissions of Japan and various other major economies,\" said Apostolous Petropolous, an energy modeller with the IEA.",
      "The agency says that even when compared to medium-sized cars that run on petrol and diesel, SUVs burn 20% more of such fuels as they weigh up to 300 kg more on average.",
      "In fact, road transport is responsible for more than 12% of global carbon emissions which is the main driver of global warming. Scientists say all sectors must rapidly decarbonise if we are to avoid a climate catastrophe.",
      "But industry representatives say in response that not all SUVs now being sold cause an increase in emissions.",
      "BMW delays electric Mini over 'uncertainty'",
      "Why don't Europeans buy more American cars?",
      "\"Around two in five of these [new] vehicle models are zero emission as their body type lends itself well to electrification with longer battery range that can reassure consumers concerned about charging accessibility,\" said Hawes, from the SMMT.",
      "\"This has led to the average CO2 emissions of new dual purpose cars more than halving since 2000, helping the segment lead the decarbonisation of UK road mobility.\"",
      "Although the vast majority of new SUVs still burn fossil fuels, IEA officials have said that over 20% of SUVs sold in 2023 were fully electric, up from 2% in 2018.",
      "As for hybrids that can run on both electricity and fossil fuels, a study in Europe by the International Council on Clean Transportation in 2022 found only around 30% of the total distance driven by plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (all types including SUVs) was in electric mode on average.",
      "Similar results were found in other major economies such as the US and China.",
      "Overall, the back-gear towards SUVs, some experts say, has caused a significant setback in the decarbonisation of the transport sector.",
      "\"The trend toward heavier and less efficient vehicles such as SUVs (in countries where it is happening) has largely nullified the improvements in energy consumption and emissions achieved elsewhere in the world's passenger car fleet,\" said the IEA.",
      "The UK Parliament's climate change committee had a similar finding in its 2024 report on decarbonisation in the country."

      "This is part of the body's fight-or-flight response that has evolved to help us react quickly to the sounds like a predator crashing through the bushes.",
      "\"So your heart rate goes up, your nervous system starts to kick in and you release stress hormones,\" Prof Clark tells me.",
      "All of this is good in an emergency, but over time it starts to cause damage.",
      "\"If you're exposed for several years, your body's reacting like that all the time, it increases your risk of developing things like heart attacks, high blood pressure, stroke and type 2 diabetes,\" says Prof Clark.",
      "Insidiously, this even happens while we're fast asleep. You might think you adapt to noise. I thought I did when I lived in a rental near an airport. But the biology tells a different story.",
      "\"You never turn your ears off; when you're asleep, you're still listening. So those responses, like your heart rate going up, that's happening whilst you're asleep,\" adds Prof Clark.",

      "The crucial number for heart health is 53 decibels, she tells me, and the higher you go the greater the health risks.",

      "The group, led by actress Natasha Lyonne, also includes Bette Midler, Aubrey Plaza, Ava DuVernay, Paul Simon, Mark Ruffalo and hundreds of others.",
      "The letter states that OpenAI and Google have recently recommended the government remove \"all legal protections and existing guardrails surrounding copyright law protections for the training of Artificial Intelligence.\" The group believes loosening copyright laws to help AI learn would come at the expense of creative industries.",
      "OpenAI, a major U.S. artificial intelligence company, and Google\u00a0both wrote to the Office of Science and Technology Policy about an AI action plan this month, making the case that it would be beneficial for AI developers to be able to use copyrighted materials to train AI.",
      "Google argued that exceptions to copyright laws would allow the use of \"copyrighted, publicly available material for AI training without significantly impacting rights holders,\" and that fair use and text-and-data mining exceptions would balance existing copyright rules.",
      "Actors have long fought against the expansion of AI, with fears that it would undermine their creative work. One of the major setbacks during the 2024 SAG-AFTRA union negotiations with major production companies was that the parties could not agree on AI regulations in the film industry.",
      "SAG-AFTRA, the union that represents about 160,000 performers, wanted film and TV producers to obtain consent from actors to create and use their digital replicas. They also fought for actors to be compensated at their usual rate \u2013 even if the role is performed by a digital replica of them.",
      "After a 118-day strike during the contract negotiations, SAG-AFTRA and the actors it represents won, and the deal included rules about consent and compensation when AI is used in film and TV shows.",
      "California Gov. Gavin Newsom signed two bills into law last year\u00a0that protect actors from artificial intelligence replicas. One requires labor contracts to specify if there will be AI-generated replicas of an actor, while the other bans the commercial use of digital replicas of performers who are deceased in any media \u2014 including TV shows, films and video games \u2014 without getting consent from their estates.",
      "The number of artists who signed the open letter is growing, and also includes Ben Stiller, Ayo Edebiri, model and actress Cara Delevingne, directors Guillermo del Toro and Taika Waititi, \"SNL\" actress Chloe Fineman and Oscar-winner Cate Blanchett. The group initially asked the government for a response by Saturday at 11:59 p.m. but has continued to collect signatures on the letter as that deadline has elapsed.",
      "The letter states that the entertainment industry supports more than 2.3 million jobs in the U.S. and pays more than $229 billion in wages annually and argues that \"AI companies are asking to undermine this economic and cultural strength by weakening copyright protections for the films, television series, artworks, writing, music, and voices used to train AI models at the core of multi-billion dollar corporate valuations.\"",
      "Last month, Vice President JD Vance warned European Union countries against overregulation of AI during the Artificial Intelligence Action summit in Paris, France. While speaking to tech executives and world leaders, Vance said the excessive regulation of the AI sector could \"kill a transformative industry just as it's taking off.\"",

    "story": [
      "A federal judge dismissed the charges Monday against a Minnesota man accused of hiding a stolen pair of ruby slippers that Judy Garland wore in the 1939 musical \"The Wizard of Oz\" after prosecutors informed the court that he died on Sunday.",
      "Jerry Hal Saliterman, 77, of Crystal, who had been in poor health with lung disease and other ailments, had been scheduled to change his plea to guilty in January but that hearing was postponed indefinitely after he was hospitalized.",
      "Federal prosecutor Matthew Greenley notified the court in a one-page motion Monday that Saliterman died Sunday but did not say how or where. U.S. District Judge Patrick Schiltz granted the request and dropped the charges.",
      "Defense attorney John Brink confirmed Monday that his client had died but declined to give details. A spokesman for the U.S. Attorney's Office in Fargo, North Dakota, which is handling the case, did not immediately return a phone call seeking further information.",
      "According to court filings, Saliterman was hospitalized in early January \"for inability to walk and sepsis,\" an infection that can be life-threatening. He attended his arraignment three days later via video from what looked like a hospital room. In an update to the court late last month, Brink told the court that his client had been discharged to a hospice facility and that his prognosis was poor. An accompanying letter from his doctor listed severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease requiring supplemental oxygen and Parkinson's disease.",
      "Saliterman was in a wheelchair and on oxygen last March when he made his first court appearance. He was charged then with theft of a major artwork and witness tampering for his role in the ruby slippers case.",
      "The sequined red slippers were stolen in 2005 from the Judy Garland Museum in her hometown of Grand Rapids. Hollywood memorabilia collector Michael Shaw had loaned his pair to the museum before Terry Jon Martin   stole them.  Their whereabouts remained a mystery for nearly 13 years until the FBI recovered them in 2018. They fetched a record for movie memorabilia of $32.5 million in December, according to Heritage Auctions.",
      "The Judy Garland Museum's efforts to buy back the slippers at auction ultimately failed, despite being bolstered by $100,000 set aside by state lawmakers.",
      "The slippers were one of several pairs Garland wore during the filming. Only three other pairs remain.",
      "Martin, now 78, of Grand Rapids, used a hammer to smash the glass of the museum's door and display case to steal them. According to his attorney, an old associate with connections to the mob told him the shoes had to be adorned with real jewels to justify their $1 million insured value. Martin's attorneys described the theft as \"one last score\" for the aging reformed mobster. But Martin got rid of the slippers when he learned they were fake, and they ended up with Saliterman. Martin pleaded guilty in 2023 and was sentenced last January to time served because of his poor health.",
      "Garland was born Frances Gumm in 1922. She lived in Grand Rapids, about 200 miles north of Minneapolis, until she was 4 years old. She died in 1969. The Judy Garland Museum says it has the world's largest collection of Garland and \"Wizard of Oz\" memorabilia.",

      "WILLIAM: When I was a boy, my father, an Air Force fighter pilot, would tell me stories before bedtime, making up characters and weaving them into exciting tales of adventure. Every story had a moral. Elmer the Elf was always honest and kind, helping those less fortunate. Freddy the Frog was courageous and heroic, saving people from aliens and bad guys.",

      "KELLY: I've always understood the power of storytelling, but as a new mother, I'm even more aware of how crucial it is to continue our family tradition of reading to my daughter. At a time when reading levels are declining and screen time is on the rise, it's more important than ever to share stories that teach valuable lessons in fun and engaging ways.",

    "summary": "The Emmy-winning star of \"Succession\" earned an Olivier Award for portraying 26 different characters in Oscar Wilde's \"The Picture of Dorian Gray\" in London. And now, she's bringing her chameleonic performance to Broadway.",
    "story": [
      "Sarah Snook set the record straight for us: Her last name is pronounced \"Snuke\" (like nuke), not \"Snook\" (as in book or took).",
      "On Broadway this spring, she's neither Snuke nor Snook, but 26 completely different people. The 37-year-old Australian is chameleonic in Oscar Wilde's \"The Picture of Dorian Gray,\" changing accents, wigs, and gender to tell the story of a man who makes a spiritual bargain to appear eternally young, while his portrait reflects the hideousness of his actions.",
      "The show has suspense, horror, humor, and also a lot of heart. \"People don't often credit Oscar Wilde with something heartfelt,\" I said.",
      "\"Yeah, he has a lot of pathos,\" Snook said. \"I think there's a lot of empathy for the human condition \u2013 I think, you know, seeing the soul as a real thing and as a part of your body, personality, spiritual makeup that one might need to protect and look after.\"",
      "It's a performance for which Snook won an Olivier (the British theater award) during the show's run in London's West End.",
      "Oscar Wilde published the story (his only novel) in 1890. Victorian critics called it \"poisonous\" and \"morally depraved.\" Now, almost a century-and-a-half later, the tale feels resonant. Snook said today is an interesting time to come to this story, \"where we have such an image-based culture and ability to construct a visual image to sell to anyone online, on Instagram. And part of the reason of playing multiple different characters is about choosing which mask is the right mask, which is the public/private mask that we show of ourselves.\"",
      "After making her name known abroad, Snook is now beloved by American audiences as Siobhan \"Shiv\" Roy, the cutthroat billionaire she played as the scion of a family empire on the TV series \"Succession.\" The saltiness of her Shiv garnered Snook legions of fans, and several awards.",
      "But Snook initially didn't want to audition for Shiv because, she says, she couldn't relate to her being beautiful and wealthy. \"Yeah, there was nothing in myself that I could see as, like, reflective or accessible in that character,\" she said.",
      "Like Dorian Gray, Shiv is an anti-hero, and Snook's been drawn to those complicated characters for a long time: \"I watched a ton of Disney films when I was a kid, and all I wanted to be was Ursula and Scar, all the villains, all the people who had seeming more complexity to why they were that in the first place.\"",
      "Snook discovered that complexity for herself during one of her first acting gigs back home in Adelaide: \"I used to do fairy parties. It was such a good training ground, 'cause kids, man, they tell you if they're not interested.\"",
      "Was she heckled? \"Yeah. Like, 'Fly! Lemme see you fly! Come on! Why can't you fly? Show us!'\"",
      "Kip Williams, the director and adapter of \"Dorian Gray,\" arrived at the National Institute of Dramatic Art in Sydney the year that Snook had just left. \"There was this word around school that there was this incredible red-headed actress, so my radar as a director was up for Sarah from the beginning,\" he said.",
      "Williams knew that he wanted to collaborate with Snook, and felt that a single actor could embody all the facets of Wilde's legendary work. \"Oscar Wilde talks about this notion that life is one grand act of theater, and that people are always in a form of performance where they are either revealing or concealing parts of themselves,\" Williams said. \"So, the form of this piece \u2013 one performer playing all of these 26 characters \u2013 is an expression of that idea.\"",
      "It is with technology that Williams illuminates humanity. He calls it \"cine-theater\" \u2013 combining live performance with cameras, large screens, and pre-recorded videos.",
      "So, is it fair to call this a one-woman show? \"I think it is definitely a one-person show,\" Williams said, \"but it is also, paradoxically, an ensemble piece. The camera team and the crew are kind of like her co-performers. They dance with her on stage \u2013 literally, one moment.\"",
      "A dance that feels intimately familiar to Snook: \"The feeling of a camera really close to you and not having that disrupt your train of thought or your flow, I think that's something that was really useful in 'Succession,' 'cause we kind of absorbed them as extra characters in the scene,\" she said.",
      "Snook has a few extra characters in her own life, too. She got married during the pandemic and has a young daughter. But as it turns out, Sarah Snook has not bitten off more than she can chew.",
      "\"So, this is your Broadway debut. Is the pressure off since you've already had such a successful run?\" I asked.",
      "Snook replied, \"Actually, one thing that Kip said on the first day of rehearsals is, 'You can only eat an elephant one spoonful at a time.' 'Yeah, sure. Okay. I'll do it that way.'\"",
      "\"So you think you've eaten the whole thing by now?\"",
      "\"No, now I've gotta eat the Broadway part of the elephant!\" Snook laughed.",

    "story": [
      "In recent years, research has suggested a connection between oral bacteria and Alzheimer's disease, raising concerns for those with poor dental health.",
      "With nearly 700 species of bacteria inhabiting the human mouth, experts say maintaining good oral hygiene could benefit both heart and brain health.",
      "There is growing evidence suggesting good oral health could help prevent Alzheimer's disease. One study in the Journal of Alzheimer's Disease\u00a0found that people who flossed regularly had a lower risk of developing Alzheimer's than those who did not.",
      "However, researchers caution there is still limited research. The observational studies do not prove that flossing directly prevents Alzheimer's disease.",
      "\"When you think about it, what is poor gum health, poor dental health? It's really a bacterial infection,\" explained Dr. Celine Gounder, CBS News medical contributor. \"When you have chronic infection, chronic inflammation, we know that chronic inflammation increases your risk for heart disease, for cerebrovascular disease, brain disease. It's really important to control these things.\"",
      "According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, about 4 in 10 U.S. adults 30 years or older have some form of periodontal disease.",
      "In addition to causing inflammation, the bacteria associated with gum disease produce enzymes that can be directly toxic to nerves, Gounder said. They also weaken the blood-brain barrier, allowing toxins and other bacteria to enter the brain.",
      "Research shows that these oral bacteria can increase amyloid in the brain \u2014 a protein plaque connected with Alzheimer's disease.",
      "The mouth-to-brain pathway occurs when bacteria from dental problems enter the bloodstream.",
      "\"When you have gum disease and dental problems, the bacteria in your mouth are getting into the blood, and from the blood, they can travel anywhere, including the heart and the brain,\" Gounder said.",
      "This bacterial spread isn't a new concern. Before antibiotics became available in the 1800s, dental infections commonly led to heart valve infections and heart failure as bacteria spread through the bloodstream.",
      "While water picks and mouthwash offer some benefits, Gounder emphasized they aren't sufficient replacements for flossing.",
      "\"Water picks are better than nothing, but mouthwash is not a substitute ... There is really no replacement for something like flossing,\" she said.",
      "The National Institutes of Health identifies several signs of gum disease, including red, swollen, or bleeding gums; pain while chewing; persistent bad breath; and loose or sensitive teeth.",
      "For prevention, the NIH recommends brushing teeth with fluoride toothpaste, flossing regularly, visiting the dentist twice per year, and avoiding smoking.",
      "The recommendation is to floss once daily, preferably before bed. However, people with gingivitis, receding gums, diabetes or heart disease may benefit from flossing at least twice daily.",

    "story": [
      "Former heart surgeon and television host Dr. Mehmet Oz testified Friday before the Senate Finance Committee over his nomination to head the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services under President Trump.",
      "The GOP-led committee will next schedule a vote on whether to send Oz's nomination to the full Senate, where he is likely to be approved given the Republican majority.",
      "If confirmed, Oz would be the administrator charged with overseeing the nearly $1.5 trillion spent by the federal government on Medicare and Medicaid. The two health insurance programs for seniors and poor Americans make up\u00a0more than a third\u00a0of the budget.",
      "Medicare\u00a0covers around 65 million people, through programs run directly by the federal government or contracted out to private insurers.\u00a0Medicaid\u00a0supports around 85 million, through programs administered primarily by state governments overseen by CMS.",
      "CMS also sets rules that affect private health insurance, including overseeing the Affordable Care Act's health insurance marketplaces.",
      "Oz\u00a0previously worked\u00a0as a professor of cardiac surgery at Columbia University and host of \"The Dr. Oz Show\" until 2022, when he stopped taping new television episodes to run for a Senate seat in Pennsylvania. He lost that Senate race to Democrat John Fetterman, in a\u00a0narrow contest\u00a0where abortion had ranked as a top issue for voters.",
      "Oz's priorities for Medicare and Medicaid",
      "Oz outlined a vision for the agency focused in large part on modernizing its systems and tools, addressing waste and fraud and incentivizing Americans to make healthier lifestyle choices.",
      "\"Some of these decisions are not difficult. Some of them need to be simplified. And some of them need to be reminded frequently,\" Oz told senators of the healthier lifestyle choices he wants to encourage, adding later that \"the idea of giving incentives to patients is an idea that I think is a worthy one, especially for Medicaid beneficiaries.\"",
      "It will be up to Oz to finalize or abandon some major changes to Medicare and Medicaid sought by the Biden administration, like\u00a0a pricey proposal\u00a0in November to expand coverage to drugs used for weight loss like Wegovy and Ozempic.",
      "Oz did not directly address the proposal during the hearing. But he did promise to continue the Medicare drug price negotiation program launched by the Biden administration, from the Inflation Reduction Act.",
      "\"It's the law. I'm going to defend it and use it,\" Oz told senators.",
      "He also voiced support for allowing states to add work requirements in Medicaid. Oz also said he wants work requirements to be defined broadly, to include activities like going to school or volunteering at a church.",
      "\"I don't think you need to use paperwork to prove a work requirement. And I don't think that should be used as an obstacle, a disingenuous effort to block people from getting on Medicaid,\" he said.",
      "Oz criticizes Medicare Advantage",
      "During Friday's hearing, Oz singled out Medicare Advantage as one of the biggest sources of waste and abuse within the insurance industry.",
      "Just over\u00a0half of seniors\u00a0have opted for these plans offered by private insurers but paid for by taxpayers, according to the latest federal data, instead of \"original Medicare\" coverage.",
      "He cited\u00a0reports\u00a0showing spending on the private alternatives outpacing traditional Medicare coverage as \"upside down\" what it should be, questioning spending by plans and efforts by brokers to persuade seniors to sign up.",
      "He also criticized the practice of \"upcoding\" within Medicare Advantage, where providers or plans bill for treating patients as sicker than they actually are.",
      "\"A part of this is just recognizing there's a new sheriff in town. We actually have to go after places and areas where we're not managing the American people's money well,\" Oz said.",
      "Oz calls for limiting prior authorization",
      "Oz also faced questions over the significant authority he would wield over private health insurance.",
      "On Monday, CMS proposed making several moves to reverse Biden administration expansions to the insurance marketplace created by the Affordable Care Act, like shortening the open enrollment period and excluding DACA recipients from coverage. In 2022, Oz said that the law \"caused havoc on our health care system\" and that he \"wouldn't have voted for it.\"",
      "During the hearing, Oz criticized health insurance companies misusing prior authorization - sometimes delaying treatment until doctors and patients can persuade insurers that it is necessary - as \"a pox on the system.\"",
      "\"We're spending money, wasting money, trying to do a process that should be automated. I would argue we could limit the number of preauthorized procedures to a thousand,\" he told senators.",
      "Republicans optimistic Oz will be confirmed",
      "In social media posts last month, Oz\u00a0has touted\u00a0\"great conversations\" with key Republicans he would need to win over for his nomination. Multiple Republicans at Friday's hearing said they were optimistic Oz would be confirmed.",
      "Sen. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, the Republican chair of the Senate's health committee, was among those to sit down with Oz last month. Cassidy is one of four medical doctors in the Senate.",
      "\"Great meeting with Dr. Mehmet Oz, President Trump's nominee to lead the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. It will be great to have a doctor in charge,\" Cassidy\u00a0posted\u00a0on Feb. 5.",
      "Oz was the fourth of Trump's health official picks to face questioning from senators. It comes a day after a hearing for Dr. David Weldon was abruptly canceled, after the White House\u00a0withdrew his nomination\u00a0to head the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "A majority of senators on the Senate's health committee advanced Dr. Jay Bhattacharya, the president's nominee to head the National Institutes of Health, and Dr. Marty Makary, the pick to head the Food and Drug Administration, on Thursday.",
      "Oz's potential new supervisor, Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr., was narrowly confirmed by the Senate a month ago.",
      "Democrats criticized Oz's past",
      "Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon, the top Democrat on committee, during the hearing accused Oz of \"dodging Medicare and Social Security taxes.\" Wyden said a tax loophole has \"benefited Dr. Oz by $440,000 in the last three years.\"",
      "During the hearing, Oz did not respond to the allegation. A memo from the committee's Democratic staff had concluded that Oz may have underpaid his taxes based on a questionairre he submitted, his tax returns and financial disclosures.",
      "\"Now, the doctor will testify about his concern for Medicare's well being, yet he is unwilling to pay the same taxes that millions of Americans pay out of every paycheck,\" Wyden said.",
      "The president's pick to head CMS has earned criticism from some Senate Democrats for months, who have cited Oz's past embrace of \"alarming pseudoscience,\" record of anti-abortion statements and worries over conflicts of interest.",
      "As part of an ethics agreement published last month, Oz said he will resign from positions at several companies, including the nutritional supplement company iHerb and the drugmaker Housey Pharma. He also pledged to divest from several healthcare companies, including insurance giant UnitedHealth Group.",
      "After the Senate race, Oz had been advertised as iHerb's global advisor. He continued to promote iHerb's supplements on social media after his nomination.",
      "He has also continued to republish past excerpts from his show in recent years after the Senate race, like a clip he shared on Sept. 4 from a sponsored interview about Medicare Advantage coverage. In 2020, Oz would later propose that Medicare Advantage should be expanded to all Americans.",
      "In the clip, Oz said that enrollment in Medicare Advantage had grown 70% since he started his show.",

    "summary": "Barred from catching salmon off the California coast, fishermen have been running boat tours to stay afloat.",
    "story": [
      "William Smith has long fished the California coast for salmon, taking avid anglers out on his boat in hopes they'll get to wrestle with and reel in the prized catch.",
      "But not anymore.",
      "Smith, known as \"Capt. Smitty,\" now spends time on the seas with aspiring whale watchers, or scattering the ashes of the deceased \u2014 whatever it takes to stay afloat since salmon fishing was barred in California two years ago due to dwindling stocks. Smith said a rise in the Bay Area's Hindu and Buddhist communities has made sea burials more popular, and he now does more than 200 a year \u2014 and that's helping him pay off his $250,000 boat engine.",
      "\"The bills keep going, whether I've got a fishery or not,\" said Smith, who runs Riptide Sportfishing in Half Moon Bay, California. \"There's no season on when people die.\"",
      "California's sport and commercial fishermen have been walloped by two years of salmon closures and are bracing for a potential third, which they blame on a years-earlier drought and state and federal water management policies they say have made it tough for the species to thrive. The closures have taken a toll on people's livelihoods in coastal communities where salmon, fishermen say, is a special fish.",
      "Salmon must swim upstream to lay their eggs, and young fish make their way out to the ocean through California's waterways \u2014 something done more easily when cool water flows are abundant. The fishery has long been strained and the Pacific Fishery Management Council, which manages West Coast fisheries, said there will be very limited salmon fishing this year in California, if at all. A decision is due in April.",
      "The dim outlook comes as President Donald Trump has ordered officials to find ways to put \"people over fish\" and route more water to farmers in California's crop-rich Central Valley and residents of its densely-populated cities. Trump has professed his love for farmers and contends too much heed is paid to the tiny delta smelt, a federally-threatened species seen as an indicator of the health of California's Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta.",
      "But salmon depend on this same water system for their survival. And some in the fishing community are wondering if fishermen aren't people, too.",
      "\"We are people that are hardworking and it's our jobs on the line,\" said Sarah Bates, a commercial fishing captain in San Francisco. She said local markets have been devastated by the salmon closures and Bay Area restaurants aren't snapping up halibut or other catch as they did salmon.",
      "Decline in salmon population",
      "The history of commercial salmon fishing in California dates back more than a century, and in the 1970s and 1980s the fishery thrived off the state's coast. Over time, salmon fishing has declined with swings in stocks amid volatile weather patterns in a drought-prone state and water management decisions about when surface water, and how much of it, should flow to farms, burgeoning cities and the ecologically-sensitive bay delta.",
      "California's salmon fishing industry includes commercial fleets and charters that take anglers out for recreation.",
      "Jamie O'Neill, owner of Seattle-based Dock Street Brokers, said many of California's commercial salmon fishermen are getting out of the business, selling their permits or simply letting them expire. Permits now sell for a fraction of what they used to, and there are fewer than 900 permits compared to 1,200 in 2010, he said.",
      "Charter operators, meanwhile, have branched out to host boat tours and party cruises, especially since short trips require little fuel and can help offset the cost of boat maintenance.",
      "While fishermen can still catch halibut, cod and striped bass along the extensive Pacific coastline, they say without the all-popular King Salmon, anglers just aren't coming like before. Each fish requires a different bait and technique, and a fast-swimming salmon is a fighter that anglers aspire to catch.",
      "\"One is hamburger, and one is filet mignon,\" said Andy Guiliano, whose sportfishing boat the Pacific Pearl in Emeryville has expanded its historic tour offerings since the closure. \"It makes the cash register ring.\"",

      "Half the job has already been supplied. But once the tariff goes into effect it will be applied to the remaining $75,000, adding $19,000 to the at-cost total. Once JC Ryan applies its mark up, that means the customer will owe $30,000 more than originally planned, Schnipper said.",
      "Bar Zakheim, owner of Better Place Design & Build, a contracting business in San Diego that specializes in building accessible dwelling units, said Canada remains the best source for lumber.",
      "But by sticking with imported lumber, Zakheim had to raise his prices about 15% compared with a year ago, he told the Associated Press.",
      "\"I'm not about to go out of business, but it's looking to be a slow, expensive year for us,\" he said.",
      "Still, Kraut notes there are limits to how much homebuilders can lift prices to offset their own rising costs. \"You can only pass through so much to the consumer, and if the Walmarts and Targets and homebuilders say we can't afford these prices, they'll say you have to lower lumber prices coming out of Canada or we aren't going to buy it.\"",
      "After Trump earlier this month provided a one-month reprieve from tariffs on U.S. imports from Mexico and Canada, including softwood lumber, the NAHB warned that the levies \"will make it harder for builders and their customers to move ahead with new construction projects.\"",

    "summary": "The first weeks of the new Trump administration have sparked stock market jitters and recession fears. Here's advice from top experts.",
    "story": [
      "Watching your 401(k) plan savings recede as stocks slide can be gut-wrenching, sparking anxiety about whether you'll ever be able to retire \u2014 a particularly loaded issue for Gen Xers, given the oldest members of the generation are hitting 60 this year.",
      "But financial experts say it's important not to panic in the face of plunging markets\u00a0or rising\u00a0recession risks\u00a0because that can lead to rash decisions that cost you money. Instead, it's important to focus on some key investment questions before taking action, they say.",
      "Since his Jan. 20 inauguration, President Trump's tariff barrage has spooked investors and soured consumers on the economy, with many fearing that his trade policies will trigger inflation and slam economic growth. The S&P 500 last week briefly moved into so-called \"correction\" territory, meaning the index had tumbled 10% from its most recent high, although it regained some ground on Friday.",
      "The downdraft in stocks is causing angst among people saving for retirement, experts say.",
      "\"First of all, you aren't alone \u2014 a lot of people are panicking,\" TIAA wealth management director Doug Ornstein told CBS MoneyWatch. \"Don't overreact, but it might be appropriate to take some action.\"",
      "The market turmoil comes as many employees already feel behind the curve, with 7 in 10 workers saying they believe they could work until they retire and still not have enough money to fund their golden years, according to a new Transamerica Center for Retirement Studies report.",
      "\"Everyone is navigating difficult waters right now and trying to understand what the effects of market volatility will be on their overall retirement savings,\" noted Catherine Collinson, CEO and president of the Transamerica Center for Retirement Studies. \"One thing they should be doing, but many aren't, is engaging in the basics.\"",
      "Here are some key questions that experts recommend you consider before making changes to your retirement account.",
      "What is your appetite for risk?",
      "It's easy to think you've got a high tolerance for risk when stocks are in a bull market, as they've been for the last few years. But the current market turmoil may be a sign that that you're more cautious than you thought, experts say.",
      "Risk tolerance is sometimes assessed in a quiz (such as this one from Vanguard) that asks hypothetical questions about your approach towards investing, such as whether you might sell a bond if it lost money in a short period of time.",
      "\"How do I think about risk, and how do I feel about risk emotionally and psychologically \u2014 all of that is completely valid to consider,\" TIAA's Ornstein said.",
      "But it's also important to consider your risk capacity, which involves a more complicated calculation including data such as your age and your retirement horizon. That offers a more objective way to assess risk than your emotional reaction to losing money on investment.",
      "\"Both things are really important: How you feel about risk, and what resources do you have\" to manage that risk, he noted.",
      "Is your time horizon really what you think it is?",
      "Workers often think about their investment horizon as the number of years they have left in the workforce, which might seem daunting to a Gen Xer who is getting closer to retirement.",
      "But the truth, which might not be intuitive to some workers, is that this timeframe is likely much longer than you expect, Ornstein said.",
      "\"Let's say someone is 60 and plans to retire at 67 \u2014 they don't have a lot of time for the market to recover\" before they retire, he noted. \"But if you retire at 67 and live to 95, most of your money will probably remain invested for next 20, 25, 30 years.\"",
      "He added, \"We'll see a lot of ups and downs, bull and bear markets, presidential administrations, and economic cycles over the next 20 to 30 years, so what is happening right now shouldn't dictate a massive change.\"",
      "In other words, someone whose retirement is just a few years away might have an actual investment time horizon of 30 years, which means sticking to their financial plan.",
      "More generally, trying to time the market, or trading individual stocks in an effort to capture gains and avoid losses, is almost impossible and typically leads to financial losses and lost opportunities, considerable research\u00a0has found.",
      "Is your investment portfolio sufficiently diversified?",
      "Although it's important not to overreact when markets are rocky, rebalancing your investments can be a good idea is such periods, Ornstein said.",
      "\"Buy and hold works well when the market is just going up and up,\" he said. When markets head south, \"It may be a good time to consider rebalancing into a more diversified mix of investments.\"",
      "For instance, that means not only checking your mix of equities and fixed income, but also your mix of sub-asset classes within those categories. Adding international stocks, for instance, on top of your S&P 500 index fund could help spread the risk, as well as considering different types of fixed income investments aside from Treasuries.",
      "And don't forget to tend to your emergency savings, given that having a cash buffer can help in times of financial stress and keep you from raiding your retirement account, noted Transamerica's Collinson. Her group's research found that 37% of workers have tapped their retirement accounts, suggesting that many people use their 401(k)s as an emergency fund.",
      "Workers can ask their employers to set aside a portion of their paycheck in another bank account that they earmark for emergency savings. Some employers also are starting to enroll workers in accounts specifically designed for emergencies, a change that was enabled by the Secure 2.0 retirement law.",
      "\"The research indicates many workers lack adequate emergency savings,\" she said. \"Now is the time to find out how to build that up.\"",

There's also another, less-closely watched index that is showing signs of trouble ahead.",
      "The Russell 2000, a stock index made up of small companies, is down more than 18% since its peak in November when Mr. Trump was elected. The index initially rose on optimism that the new administration would create a more business-friendly environment, but that sentiment has changed amid an escalating trade war with some of the U.S.'s closest allies. Mass federal layoffs initiated by the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, have also created tremendous uncertainty for businesses.",
      "Now, the small-cap index is headed toward a bear market, defined by a decline of 20% or more from its most recent high.",
      "\"Some small caps like the Russell 2000 were outperforming the S&P 500 after the election, presumably on the theory that there was going to be substantial deal activity, because these companies are more likely to be acquired and merge than the largest of the large-caps,\" Daniel Hornung, former deputy director of the National Economic Council, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"There was a sense that there was going to be deregulation and easier environment for transactions to occur, but there's a huge amount of uncertainty hanging over the economy and markets right now that makes it really difficult for transactions to happen,\" Hornung explained.",
      "Broad-based tariffs on Mexico, Canada and China, plus 25% levies on steel and aluminum threaten to raise costs for both businesses and consumers. Smaller companies with tighter profit margins have a harder time absorbing greater input costs compared to larger ones.",
      "Canary in the coal mine",
      "The Russell 2000 comprises small companies across a variety sectors, and is widely considered to be a benchmark for small U.S. stocks. Unlike the tech-heavy S&P 500, it is not weighted toward a particular industry.",
      "Small companies are more exposed to market shocks than larger ones, given that they operate on thinner margins and typically have higher borrowing costs, making the index more sensitive to changes in the economy.",
      "\"It's more diversified at the sectoral level, so it is more representative of U.S. growth dynamics,\" Skanda Amarnath, a macroeconomist and executive director of Employ America, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Some of the Russell 2000 companies include commercial jet engine company FTAI Aviation, grocery chain Sprouts Farmers Market, plant-based food company Beyond Meat, and language learning tool Duolingo.",
      "Not pointing to a recession",
      "While the Russell 2000 is only two percentage points away from entering bear market territory, Bank of America Research economists say it's not pricing in a recession, and they still expect the economy to grow this year.",
      "\"Historically in recessions the Russell 2000 has sold off close to 40% on average,\" said Jill Carey Hall, head of U.S. small- and mid-cap strategy at Bank of America Research. \"So it's not pricing in greater than a 50% probability of a recession at this point.\"",
      "Still, small businesses could face significant profit margin erosion with tariffs in place.",
      "Based on the levies currently in place on Canada, Mexico and China, and assuming retaliatory tariffs, Bank of America estimates that the earnings hit could be three times larger for small caps than for large caps.",
      "\"These companies have much thinner margins, so a rise in input costs hurts them more,\" Carey Hall said.",

      "The removal of application materials also has caused confusion around the recertification process for borrowers already enrolled in repayment plans, experts say. Income-driven repayment plans take a borrower's finances and family size into account when calculating monthly payments, but borrowers must periodically demonstrate they still qualify.",
      "Adding to the uncertainty are layoffs at the Education Department, which oversees the federal loan system. The federal website for student loans and financial aid, StudentAid.gov, suffered an hours-long outage Wednesday, but the department has said it will continue to deliver on its commitments.",

      "Guidance for those with student loans",
      "All borrowers currently enrolled in income-driven repayment plans should \"get a sense of when your recertification deadline is and get a sense of what options are available to you if the form is not available online to recertify your income,\" Ba\u00f1ez said.",
      "Recertification confirms a borrower's financial situation. With some forms not currently available, borrowers who are unable to complete that process could be in jeopardy.",

      "Guinness, the Irish beer that has been around since before the American Revolution, is celebrating a renaissance with rapidly rising popularity in the United States.",
      "\"People are finding this beer for the first time, or, in some cases, rediscovering it,\" said Ryan Wagner, Guinness National Ambassador. \"You're not just finding it in Irish pubs. Now it's in sports bars, at the beach, in coolers being taken to tailgates.\"",
      "Part of this resurgence is attributed to social media, where the viral \"Splitting the G\" challenge has celebrities like Ed Sheeran and Niall Horan attempting to take one or two gulps and land the beer line precisely in the gap of the letter \"G\" in the logo.",
      "For newcomers concerned about Guinness' dark appearance, Wagner offered reassurance.",
      "\"The first thing we would tell someone is don't let the color scare you away. It's light in body. It's a little roasty, a little toasty, incredibly drinkable, and something that's built around occasions, bringing people together.\"",
      "The legacy of Guinness",
      "The brewing legacy dates back to 1759 in Dublin. Today, 3.5 million pints are produced daily and shipped worldwide. Devoted fans insist the beer requires a specific \"perfect pour\" technique \u2014 a two-part process that affects both taste and texture.",
      "This meticulous pouring process has spawned dedicated enthusiasts like the trio behind New York State of Pint, who anonymously rate New York City's best pints of Guinness using a scoring system that evaluates taste, pour quality, glassware, temperature and bar ambiance.",
      "\"We're not looking for favorable treatment,\" said one of the anonymous raters. \"We really just want to rate the Guinness and spread the word about good Guinness in the city.\"",

      "\"More than ever before, we value our time together. And the more that we find excuses to bring people together, whether that's a massive sporting event or just a couple of buddies sitting at the bar, Guinness draught stout is always going to be a part of those conversations.\"",

    "published": "Fri, 14 Mar 2025 07:35:18 -0400",
    "summary": "Federal agencies will begin to vacate hundreds of offices nationwide this summer under a frenetic and error-prone push by DOGE to scrap leases it says waste money.",
    "story": [
      "Federal agencies will begin to vacate hundreds of offices across the country this summer under a frenetic and error-riddled push by Elon Musk's budget-cutting advisers to terminate leases that they say waste money.",
      "The White House's Department of Government Efficiency, which Musk heads, maintains a list of canceled real estate leases on its website, but internal documents obtained by The Associated Press contain a crucial detail: when those cancellations are expected to take effect. The documents from inside the General Services Administration, the U.S. government's real estate manager, list dozens of federal office and building leases expected to end by June 30, with hundreds more slated over the coming months.",
      "The rapid pace of cancellations has raised alarms, with some agencies and lawmakers appealing to DOGE to exempt specific buildings. Several agencies are facing 20 or more lease cancellations in all, including the IRS, the Social Security Administration, the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the U.S. Geological Survey.",
      "Many of the terminations would affect agencies that aren't as well-known but oversee services critical to many Americans.",
      "They span from a Boise, Idaho, office of the Bureau of Reclamation - which oversees water supply and deals with disputes across the often-parched American West, to a Joliet, Illinois, outpost of the Railroad Retirement Board, which provides benefits for railroad workers and their survivors.",
      "The lease terminations don't mean all the locations will close. In some cases, agencies may negotiate new leases to stay in place, downsize their existing space or relocate elsewhere.",
      "\"Some agencies are saying: 'I'm not leaving. We can't leave,'\" said Chad Becker, a former GSA real estate official who now represents building owners with government leases at Arco Real Estate Solutions. \"I think there's going to be a period of pushback, a period of disbelief. And then, if necessary, they may start working on the actual execution of a move.\"",
      "DOGE says GSA has notified landlords in recent weeks that it plans to terminate 793 leases, focusing mostly on those that can be ended within months without penalty. The group estimates those moves will save roughly $500 million over the terms of the leases, which in some cases were slated to continue into the 2030s. The Bureau of Reclamation cancellation in Boise, for instance, would take effect Aug. 31 and is expected to save a total of $18.7 million through 2035.",
      "But DOGE's savings estimates - a fraction of Musk's $1 trillion cost-cutting goal - haven't been verified and don't take into account the costs of moves and closures. The group hasn't released any information about what they would mean for agencies.",
      "\"My initial reaction is this is just going to cause more chaos,\" said Jim Simpson, an accountant in Arizona who helps low-income people file taxes and serves on an IRS panel that advocates for taxpayers. \"There's a lot of room to help with government efficiency, but it should be done surgically and not with a chainsaw.\"",
      "Simpson said he was surprised to learn that dozens of IRS offices, including local taxpayer assistance centers, were facing upcoming lease cancellations. He refers clients there to get paperwork to file returns and answer IRS inquiries, and he said losing services would \"cause a lot of anxiety\" and delay refunds.",
      "DOGE scrapping some lease cancelations due to mistakes",
      "Plans to cancel the leases at several of the IRS centers and other sites were in error and have been rescinded, according to a person with direct knowledge of the changes who spoke to the AP on the condition of anonymity in order to avoid retaliation. Those changes aren't reflected yet on DOGE's list, which only removed one and added dozens more in its latest update published Thursday.",
      "The GSA walked back the cancellation of a Geological Survey office in Anchorage, Alaska, for instance, after learning it didn't have termination rights, according to the person familiar with the matter.",
      "Rep. Tom Cole, R-Okla., said Monday that he'd convinced DOGE to back off lease terminations planned for the National Weather Center in Norman, a Social Security office in Lawton and the Indian Health Services office in Oklahoma City. But all three leases remained on DOGE's list of cancellations as of Thursday.",
      "GSA's press office didn't respond to inquiries.",
      "DOGE push took many by surprise",
      "While there was already a bipartisan push to reduce the government's real estate footprint, the mass cancellations blindsided an industry known for its stability.",
      "Landlords who'd been expecting government agencies to remain tenants \u2014 for several more years in some cases under their existing leases \u2014 were stunned. Some agencies learned from building managers, not their federal partners, that their leases were being canceled, according to real estate managers.",
      "Some cancelations could incur extra costs",
      "Becker, whose firm is tracking the DOGE lease cancellations, and other observers said they expect some agencies will be unable to move their personnel and property out of their spaces within such tight timelines. That may force some agencies to pay additional rent during what's known as a holdover period, undermining DOGE's stated goal of saving taxpayer money.",
      "The Building Owners and Managers Association, which represents the commercial real estate industry, told landlords in a recent advocacy alert to be prepared to seek payment from any federal government tenants who stay beyond their leases.",
      "Asked about plans for buildings with leases that will soon expire, the IRS didn't respond. A Social Security Administration spokesperson downplayed the impact of its offices losing leases, saying many were \"small remote hearing sites,\" didn't serve the public, were already being consolidated elsewhere or planned for closure.",
      "Several other agencies provided little clarity - saying they were working with GSA to consider their options, in statements that were nearly identical in some cases.",
      "But a spokesperson for the Railroad Retirement Board expressed concern over the upcoming lease cancellations of its offices in Joliet, Illinois, and eight other states, saying it was working to \"maintain a public-facing office presence for the local railroad community.\"",
      "Trimming federal real estate was already underway",
      "Government Accountability Office official David Marroni told a congressional hearing last week that the push to unload unnecessary federal real estate was \"long overdue,\" saying agencies have for too long held onto unnecessary space. But he warned the downsizing must be deliberate and carefully planned to \"generate substantial savings and mitigate the risk of mistakes and unexpected mission impacts.\"",
      "That process had already started before Musk's team arrived, with the federal government's real estate portfolio steadily declining over the last decade. Indeed, critics of DOGE say if it were truly interested in cost-cutting it could learn from GSA, whose mission even before Mr. Trump took office was to deliver \"effective and efficient\" services to the American public.",
      "A law signed by former President Joe Biden before he left office in January directed agencies to measure the true occupancy rates of leased spaces by this summer. Those that didn't meet a target of 60% use rate over time would be directed to dispose of their excess space.",
      "\"There is a logical and orderly way to do this,\" Rep. Greg Stanton, an Arizona Democrat, said at last week's hearing. Instead, he said, DOGE is pursuing a reckless approach that threatens to harm the delivery of public services.",
      "Industry observers cautioned that each situation is different and it will take months or years to understand the full impact of the lease cancellations.",
      "\"It really depends on the terms. But it is a shock, there is no question, that all of a sudden, boom, in six weeks all these things have happened,\" said J. Reid Cummings, a professor of finance and real estate at the University of South Alabama. \"It's like a blitzkrieg.\""

      "\"If this tariff is not removed immediately, the U.S. will shortly place a 200% tariff on all wines, champagnes, & alcoholic products coming out of France and other E.U. represented countries,\" he wrote. \"This will be great for the wine and champagne businesses in the U.S.\"",
      "Mr. Trump accused the EU of being \"one of the most hostile and abusive taxing and tariffing authorities in the world.\"",
      "Since returning to office, the president has threatened tariffs, and imposed the levies, on a host of major U.S. trading partners. On Wednesday, he increased tariffs on all steel and aluminum imports to 25%, prompting retaliatory action from the EU.",

The tariffs, set to take effect April 1, target a range of U.S. exports, including beef, poultry, bourbon, jeans and peanut butter.",

      "According to the Distilled Spirits Council, a retaliatory tariff imposed in 2018 during Mr. Trump's first term, caused exports of U.S.-made whiskey to drop 20%. But over the last three years, exports to the EU grew nearly 60% from $439 million in 2021 to $699 million in 2024, the trade group said.",
      "Since returning to the White House for a second term, Mr. Trump has made tariffs a key area of his economic agenda, though the levies have sparked concerns of a recession and roiled the stock market. The president declined to rule out the possibility of an economic downturn, telling Fox News in an interview that aired Sunday that \"there is a period of transition because what we're doing is very big.\"",
      "In an interview with CBS News, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said Tuesday that Mr. Trump's economic policies are \"the most important thing America has ever had\" when asked whether they would be worth it if they lead to a recession. \"It's worth it.\"",

That agreement, the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, covers the majority of goods imported from Mexico. Those that are not subject to the deal, however, still face tariffs.",

      "However, in interviews and social media posts, Mr. Trump has exaggerated the size of the U.S.trade deficit with Canada and the amount of fentanyl coming over the northern border. The president also misrepresented Canada's tariffs on U.S. dairy and lumber products.",
      "Here's a breakdown of some of these claims:",
      "Trump's misleading claim that Canada has tariffs above 200% on U.S. dairy products",
      "President Trump said March 7: \"In Canada, we find that they're charging us over 200% for dairy products\u2026 And when I left, we had that well taken care of, but under Biden they just kept raising it.\"",
      "Details: President Trump has suggested Canada unfairly put tariffs of over 200% on American dairy products during President Biden's term, but the level has been unchanged since before Biden took office.",
      "The over 200% tariffs on U.S. dairy products are only triggered if U.S. dairy exports exceed certain yearly duty-free limits, and U.S. dairy manufacturers say they have never been close to exceeding these limits.",
      "Additionally, these tariffs were negotiated during the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, which Mr. Trump signed during his first term. Canada's published tariff lists for 2020 and 2025 show tariffs on U.S. dairy products have remained unchanged from the end of his first term through the end of President Biden's term. For example, both lists show the same tariff rate of 245.5% for any cheese products above the duty-free limit.",
      "Canadian Ambassador to the U.S. Kirsten Hillman told told CBS News the dairy tariffs are in place to \"protect our farmers and families.\" Canada is the second-largest importer of U.S. dairy, purchasing about $1.1 billion worth in 2024.",
      "The U.S. sold roughly double the amount of dairy to Canada as Canada sold to the U.S. last year, according to trade data from the U.S. Census Bureau.",
      "Trump's misleading claim that Canada has a \"tremendously high tariff\" on lumber while the U.S. charges \"a tiny fraction of that\"",
      "President Trump said March 7: \"They have a tremendously high tariff, give you the exact numbers in a little while coming out, on lumber. So, they sell us lumber, they have a tremendous tariff. They make it impossible for us to sell lumber or dairy products into Canada, but our numbers are a tiny fraction of that, almost non-existent.\"",
      "Details: On March 4, Canada imposed a tariff of 25% on softwood lumber from the U.S., a rate that is high compared to recent history.",
      "But Mr. Trump did not mention these tariffs are part of Canada's response to the 25% levies on most Canadian goods, including lumber, that the Trump administration initially announced in early March, which are now expected to take effect on April 2.",
      "Before this trade escalation, Canada had imposed zero tariffs on U.S. softwood lumber for years, according to Dustin Jalbert, a senior economist at Fastmarkets who covers wood products.",
      "\"It's certainly true that right now there are tariffs in place, but that was not the case before the kickoff of the trade war. These are retaliatory to what the U.S. instigated, if you will, in early March,\" Jalbert said.",
      "The U.S. had previously placed duties on imported softwood lumber, with tariffs on Canadian lumber rising from 8% to 14.5% in 2024.",
      "Trump's false claim that the U.S. has a $200 billion trade deficit with Canada",
      "President Trump\u00a0said\u00a0March 13:\u00a0\"In the case of Canada, we're spending $200 billion a year to subsidize Canada.\"\u00a0And on Feb. 26 he said: \"The tariffs will make it impossible for them to sell lumber or anything else into the United States. And all I'm asking to do is break even or lose a little bit, but not lose $200 billion.\"",
      "Details: Mr. Trump has repeatedly exaggerated the U.S.-Canada trade deficit, claiming it's as large as $200 billion.",
      "In fact, the U.S. trade deficit in goods and services with Canada in 2024 was closer to $35.7 billion, according to the latest trade data released from the U.S. Census Bureau on March 6.\u00a0 That trade deficit narrowed from $40.6 billion in 2023.",
      "For goods alone, the U.S. bought $70.6 billion more in goods from Canada than it sold in 2024, down from $72.3 billion in 2023.",
      "The overwhelming driver of the deficit with Canada is that the U.S. buys a lot of unrefined oil from the country, according to Julian Karaguesian, a lecturer at the department of economics at McGill University.",
      "\"A lot of Canadian economists say if you take out energy, Canada is running a small deficit with the United States,\" Karaguesian said.",
      "Trump's misleading claim that large amounts of fentanyl come from Canada",
      "President Trump said in his address to Congress\u00a0March 4: \"Much has been said over the last three months about Mexico and Canada, but we have very large deficits with both of them. But even more importantly, they have allowed fentanyl to come into our country at levels never seen before, killing hundreds of thousands of our citizens.\"",
      "Details: Mr. Trump has cited Canada's failure to halt the flow of illicit drugs as a reason for imposing tariffs, saying that fentanyl has been coming from the country \"at levels never seen before.\" He claimed, \"The fentanyl coming through Canada is massive.\"",
      "However, Mr. Trump overstates the amount of fentanyl coming across the northern border. In 2024, U.S. Customs and Border Patrol seized 43 pounds of fentanyl at the U.S.-Canada border, accounting for roughly 0.2% of all fentanyl seized by CBP that year. By contrast, approximately 21,100 pounds \u2014 about 96.6% of the total \u2014 was seized at the southern border.",

      "Schumer initially signaled last week that his caucus would fight back against a partisan measure to keep the government funded. But a day later, he reluctantly pledged to advance the continuing resolution, delivering one of the Democratic votes necessary to propel the measure to passage. The move has prompted frustrations among some within his party, and questions about his leadership, but Schumer has repeatedly defended his decision.",
      "\"I knew when I took this vote there'd be a lot of protests, but I felt I had to do it for the future, not only of the Democratic Party, but the country,\" Schumer said, adding that \"as bad as that CR bill was \u2014 and it was bad \u2014 a shutdown is 10 times worse.\"",

      "Schumer said a \"shutdown would have been the greatest disaster,\" putting the government in the hands of \"evil, nasty, nihilistic people\" like Musk, President Trump and OMB Director Russ Vought.",
      "\"We would have had half the federal government we have now,\" Schumer said. \"So I thought I did the thing a leader should do: Even when people don't see the danger around the curve, my job was to alert people to it \u2014 and I knew I'd get some bullets.\"",
      "On the question of his leadership, Schumer said he isn't going anywhere, citing his record as leader on winning Senate seats, including in 2021, when Democrats secured a majority in the upper chamber with two surprise runoff victories in Georgia. Schumer came to Congress in 1981, representing New York in the House before being elected to the Senate in 1998. He's led Democrats as leader in the Senate since 2017.",
      "Schumer said Democrats are fighting back against the Trump administration with a message focused on how GOP leaders want to \"screw every average American so they can get tax cuts for the rich,\" saying the strategy is \"beginning to work.\"",
      "\"If we keep at it everyday, relentless fighting and showing how they're hurting people so badly, Trump's numbers will get much lower, and his both popularity, but also his effectiveness will decline,\" Schumer said. \"I believe that strategy will work.\"",
      "Tuesday's interview was held one day after\u00a0Schumer postponed events to promote his book, \"Antisemitism in America: A Warning,\" this week, citing security concerns following backlash from his move to keep the government funded. Schumer had a number of events scheduled this week in Maryland, New York City, Washington, D.C., Pennsylvania and California.",
      "Schumer said he wrote the book aimed at a number of audiences \u2014 including his \"friends on the left.\" He noted that while \"we've always seen antisemitism on the right,\" more recently \"a lot of it's trickled over to the left.\"",

    "summary": "The conservative Heritage Foundation sought information about whether the Department of Homeland Security gave Britain's Prince Harry \"special treatment.\"",
    "story": [
      "London - Prince Harry's U.S. immigration files must be made public by the end of the day on Tuesday, under an order issued by a Washington D.C. district court, after the conservative Heritage Foundation alleged that the British royal may have concealed past drug use when he applied for his visa. Harry currently lives in California with his wife, Meghan, and their children.",
      "Applications for visas to live in the United States ask about current and historical drug use. Admission of drug use can lead to visa applications being rejected, but immigration officers have discretion to make their final decisions on a number of factors. Lying on visa applications can lead to lifetime bans on entering the U.S..",
      "\"There's a lot of discretion that the government has, but merely admitting to drug use very often is not disqualifying from entering the country, but lying about drug use can be more serious and potentially could be disqualifying,\" CBS News legal contributor Jessica Levinson said.",
      "The Heritage Foundation alleges that Harry may have lied about his past drug use on his application. Their allegations center around claims Harry made in his memoir, published in January 2023, where he described using various types of drugs.",
      "Cocaine \"wasn't much fun, and it didn't make me particularly happy, as it seemed to make everyone around me, but it did make me feel different, and that was the main goal,\" Harry wrote.",
      "He also wrote: \"Marijuana is different. That actually really did help me.\"",
      "The Heritage Foundation lodged a freedom of information request with the Department of Homeland Security in 2023, not long after his book was published, seeking access to Harry's immigration documents.",
      "\"Harry has publicly admitted to extensive illegal drug use. What do we submit this means? That Harry seems to have received special treatment: the DHS looked the other way if the Prince answered truthfully, or it looked the other way if the Prince lied on his visa application. Either action would be wrong,\" Nile Gardiner from the Heritage Foundation said in an online post in 2024.",
      "Harry and Meghan moved to the U.S. in 2020 after stepping down as working members of Britain's royal family.",
      "Meghan is a U.S. citizen, but it is unclear what visa Harry entered the country on. The prince has not responded publicly to the Heritage Foundation's assertions since they emerged more than a year ago.",
      "In February, President Trump ruled out deporting Harry, saying he would \"leave him alone,\" adding, \"He's got enough problems with his wife. She's terrible.\"",
      "Meghan has been a vocal critic of Mr. Trump.",
      "\"Most Americans dislike the idea of celebrities being treated differently from anyone else, and Harry's fame and profile makes this case the ideal window into DHS conduct,\" the Heritage Foundation's Gardiner argued. \"If DHS granted Harry special treatment, the implications are obvious: it has likely granted such treatment in the past to others sufficiently famous or sufficiently politically aligned, and will likely continue to do so.\"",

      "Sorokin ordered on Friday that Alawieh be kept in the U.S. and brought to a court hearing on Monday. He wrote Monday morning that \"Dr. Alawieh is now in Lebanon.\"",

      "Alawieh allegedly said her interest in Nasrallah was in his standing as a religious figure within the Shia Muslim community, as opposed to his role as a political leader, according to the documents.",
      "CBP spokeswoman Hilton Beckham said those \"who promote extremist ideologies or carry terrorist propaganda are inadmissible to the U.S., plain and simple.\"",
      "\"Officers act swiftly to deny entry to those who glorify terrorist organizations, advocate violence, or openly support terrorist leaders and commemorate their deaths,\" Beckham said. \"Anyone found with extremist materials linked to a U.S.-designated terrorist group will be removed.\"",
      "An attorney for Alawieh's cousin did not immediately reply to questions sent by CBS News. On Sunday, Sorokin ordered the government to explain before the now-canceled Monday hearing why Alawieh was removed. Lawyers for her family claimed the government \"willfully\" disobeyed his order by sending Alawieh outside the U.S.",
      "The government made a filing under seal, and Sorokin said in his latest order that the filing included an affidavit from a CBP watch commander and government attorneys said at \"no time would CBP not take a court order seriously or fail to abide by a court's order.\"",
      "Alawieh has been in the U.S. since 2018 on an H-1B visa. A transplant nephrology specialist, she was involved with the care of patients before, during and after receiving kidney transplants.",
      "A lawsuit filed by Alawieh's cousin claims she was issued a visa on March 11, and her family has not been provided with information explaining why Alawieh was detained or removed. President Trump's crackdown on immigration has recently targeted university-affiliated visa holders who the administration claims have taken actions that are contrary to the national interest.",
      "In a statement, Customs and Border Protection said \"arriving aliens bear the burden of establishing admissibility to the United States.\"",

    "summary": "The government-funded news agency stopped broadcasting after its employees were put on leave or terminated.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump's dismantling of the government-funded Voice of America will pave the way for America's adversaries to have greater influence abroad, predicted the agency's director Michael Abramowitz.",
      "After Mr. Trump signed an executive order that seeks to make sweeping cuts at the nation's largest international broadcaster, about 1,300 employees, including Abramowitz, learned over the weekend they had been placed on administrative leave, and another 500 contractors were terminated. Mr. Trump accused the news agency, which began broadcasting during World War II, of spreading \"radical propaganda.\"",
      "In an interview with CBS News Monday, Abramowitz called VOA \"an incredibly important soft power tool\" for the U.S. and said shuttering it would be a \"self-inflicted blow\" to national security because VOA's news coverage helps to combat Chinese, Russian and Iranian disinformation.",
      "\"If America pulls off the playing field and cedes it to our adversaries, then they're going to be telling the narratives that people around the world are going to be hearing, and that can't be good for America,\" he said. \"They're going to be hearing an anti-America narrative. We need to fight that with truth.\"",
      "VOA reports news about the U.S. in nearly 50 languages \u2014 with much of its focus trained on countries that lack a free press. By law, the broadcasts do not air inside the U.S., but news programming is viewed widely \u2014 with an audience of about 360 million people per week worldwide.",
      "\"We are getting through to an audience that might otherwise hear propaganda,\" Abramowitz said, adding that many VOA journalists are from countries under authoritarian control. \"The major challenge for the United States in general is this global information war in which countries like China and Russia are essentially really having our lunch. \u2026 So, I really feel that we need an organization that is accurate, unbiased, objective, and that tells the truth about America to the rest of the world in the languages that they understand.\"",
      "\"That has never been more important with a sea of lies and disinformation that are going on around the world,\" he added.",
      "Still, Abramowitz acknowledged\tthat VOA, which has a $270 million annual budget, could be reformed and that it should \"not be resistant to change.\"",
      "\"I'm not saying it has to be the way it's always been,\" Abramowitz said. \"Change is great. Change is needed. Change is required.\"",
      "\"I don't personally think it's a waste of taxpayer money,\" he argued. \"Does that mean that it has to be a $270 million budget? Maybe it could be [$240 million], maybe it could be [$200 million]. Look, we are in an era where the taxpayer expects a smaller, more modernized, more streamlined government.\"",
      "He defended VOA's journalists as non-partisan and said if they harbored any bias, it is against totalitarianism, tyranny and authoritarianism.",
      "\"If you care about a free Iran, if you care about more openness in China, if you care about freedom in Russia, if you care about freedom in Venezuela and Nicaragua, then you have an incredibly important tool in VOA to help push back and to get accurate and objective information into these places that don't have it,\" he said. \"That is incredibly important.\"",

      "\"People have been waiting decades for this,\" the president said of the release of files related to the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. Mr. Trump, who was speaking at the Kennedy Center Monday, added that he didn't believe the material, \"approximately 80,000 pages,\" would be redacted.",
      "\"I said during the campaign that I'd do it, and I'm a man of my word,\" the president said of the impending release.",

      "The bureau said that the documents, which have been inventoried and digitized, \"were previously unrecognized as related to the JFK assassination case file.\" The FBI in February was transferring the records to the National Archives and Records Administration to be included in the ongoing declassification process that has been ongoing. The bureau did not say what the records contain.",

Kennedy Assassination Records Collection Act, which required all assassination-related material be kept in a single collection within the National Archives and be publicly released.

    "summary": "The government claimed it was not bound by the judge's order to block flights carrying gang members to El Salvador because it wasn't in writing.",
    "story": [
      "A federal judge admonished the Justice Department Monday for disobeying his order to turn around two planes en route to El Salvador that were carrying alleged Tren de Aragua gang members. He also demanded explanations about removal flights ordered since President Trump invoked the Alien Enemies Act\u00a0Saturday.",
      "During a hearing on the Trump administration's compliance with his order, D.C District Chief Judge James Boasberg demanded answers by Tuesday at noon to clarify what occurred Saturday \u2014 both before and after he blocked the government's removal flights. He asked the government whether additional planes have left the U.S. with Tren de Aragua gang members, and he wants a timeline showing when the flights took off from the U.S. and landed in El Salvador and a count of remaining members of the gang in U.S. custody.",
      "Boasberg also demanded detailed timing on when President Trump's order invoking the Alien Enemies Act was signed and went into effect. The 1798 act is a wartime authority allowing the president to detain and deport noncitizens. Mr. Trump is utilizing the act to detain and deport all Venezuelan migrants 14 years of age and older who are suspected of being members of the Tren de Aragua gang.",
      "A Justice Department attorney argued that because the judge did not put his order demanding the planes to return to the U.S. in writing, the government was not bound by it, but he added that even if the order had been written, the president had the authority to keep the flights en route to their final destination.",
      "\"You're telling me your first argument is when I said those things, because I didn't say it in a minute order that the plaintiffs didn't have to turn around, you didn't have to comply?\" Boasberg said. \"You're saying that you felt you could disregard it because it wasn't in a written order?\"",
      "The attorney did not provide details about how many deportation flights left Saturday, claiming that there were \"operational issues\" prohibiting him from answering. When Judge Boesberg mentioned the two flights that departed Texas at 5:26 p.m. and 5:45 p.m. local time, the attorney said that he was \"not at liberty\" to provide information about the flights.",
      "It sparked a tense back and forth between Judge Boesberg and the government over whether or not it was asserting the flight information was classified.",
      "The Justice Department also argued that because the planes were over international waters and airspace by the time the judge ordered them to turn around, that Boasberg no longer had jurisdiction over the migrants.",
      "The judge responded that his order applied to the planes, regardless of where they were in the air.",
      "The Trump administration said the two planes had left before the judge made his decision, and a third plane left for El Salvador shortly afterwards, though details about the passengers on that plane are unclear.",
      "Despite Boasberg's ruling, 261 people were deported to El Salvador Saturday,137 of whom were removed under the Alien Enemies Act over alleged gang ties, a senior administration official said.",
      "The judge's ruling responded to a federal civil lawsuit against Mr. Trump and other administration officials filed Saturday by five Venezuelan men in immigration custody in Texas and New York local jails.",
      "Boasberg's ruling prevents the deportations of the plaintiffs and migrants for 14 days. The Justice Department appealed that decision, arguing the D.C. federal court has no authority over the case because none of the five men are being held in the District of Columbia.",
      "White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt wrote on X Saturday night that the \"written order and the Administration's actions do not conflict,\" and said a \"single judge in a single city cannot direct the movements of an aircraft carrying foreign alien terrorists who were physically expelled from U.S. soil.\"",
      "Wrapping up the hearing, Boasberg said he'd issue a written order quickly because \"apparently my oral orders don't seem to carry much weight\" with the Justice Department.",
      "Before the hearing, the Justice Department filed an appeal to the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals requesting Boasberg's removal from the case, arguing that his actions in the case have been an \"inappropriate exercise of jurisdiction\" and claiming he had followed \"highly unusual and improper procedures,\" in his hearing on Saturday evening.",
      "Jake Rosen is a reporter covering the Department of Justice. He was previously a campaign digital reporter covering President Trump's 2024 campaign and also served as an associate producer for \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan,\" where he worked with Brennan for two years on the broadcast.

    "published": "Mon, 17 Mar 2025 10:31:00 -0400",
    "summary": "President Trump is questioning former President Joe Biden's signature on preemptive pardons issued to the members of the House select committee that investigated the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump claimed late Sunday that preemptive pardons former President Joe Biden granted to members of the House select committee that investigated the Jan. 6, 2021, assault on the U.S. Capitol are \"void\" and \"vacant\" because they were allegedly signed with an autopen.",
      "However, the Justice Department two decades ago said the president can use an autopen to sign legislation, and the Constitution imposes few limits on the president's pardon power.",
      "In a post to Truth Social shared just after midnight, Mr. Trump claimed without evidence that Biden himself did not sign the pardons he issued to the members of the Jan. 6 select committee, staff members, and officers from the Washington, D.C., Metropolitan Police Department and U.S. Capitol Police who testified before the panel.",
      "Biden signed the \"full and unconditional pardon\" for any offenses arising from the committee's activities on Jan. 19, one day before he left the White House. Others who received preemptive pardons were Dr. Anthony Fauci, retired Gen. Mark Milley and several Biden family members.",
      "What did Trump say about Biden's pardons?",
      "Mr. Trump claimed that the pardons his predecessor issued to the select committee members are \"hereby declared void, vacant, and of no further force of effect, because of the fact that they were done by Autopen.\" The president wrote that Biden did not sign the pardons and \"did not know anything about them,\" though Mr. Trump did not provide evidence about the circumstances surrounding Biden's clemency decision.",
      "He said the select committee members \"should fully understand that they are subject to investigation at the highest level.\"",
      "A representative for Biden did not immediately return a request for comment.",
      "The pardons were issued to the House members who served on the panel in response to Mr. Trump's threats on the campaign trail that he would target them if elected to a second term. He had accused the former and current lawmakers of destroying evidence and committing a \"major crime\" during their probe, and told NBC's \"Meet the Press\" in December that \"everybody\" who served on the committee \"should go to jail.\"",
      "Last July, Mr. Trump circulated a social media post accusing former GOP Rep. Liz Cheney, the committee's vice chair, of being \"guilty of treason\" and promoting \"televised military tribunals.\"",
      "The president's latest message shared to Truth Social suggests that his administration may investigate Cheney and the others who served alongside her on the Jan. 6 committee.",
      "What is an autopen signature?",
      "Patented in the early 1800s and used by Thomas Jefferson, the autopen is a device used to replicate handwritten signatures.",
      "Presidents have signed documents and correspondence using an autopen for decades. According to Smithsonian Magazine, Harry Truman was the first president to use autopen, and it was said to have been used frequently by President John F. Kennedy. But Barack Obama became the first president to use an autopen for legislation when he directed it to be used to sign an extension of the Patriot Act while in France in May 2011.",
      "President George W. Bush's administration weighed in on the legality of signing legislation with an autopen in 2005, when the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel concluded that \"the president need not personally perform the physical act of affixing his signature to a bill he approves and decides to sign in order for the bill to become law.\"",
      "\"Rather, the president may sign a bill within the meaning of Article I, Section 7 by directing a subordinate to affix the president's signature to such a bill, for example by autopen,\" then-Deputy Assistant Attorney General Howard Nielson, Jr., wrote in an opinion for the White House counsel.",
      "As to the pardon power, the Constitution gives the president the exclusive authority to grant clemency, with few limits. And in 2024, a three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit found that pardons or commutations do not have to be issued in writing.",
      "\"We readily determine that nothing in the Constitution restricts the president's exercise of the clemency power to commutations that have been rendered through a documented writing,\" the unanimous 4th Circuit panel wrote.",
      "While the court found that a writing \"will generally be the means of proving to a third party that the act has occurred,\" it noted that \"a clemency warrant or, indeed, any writing, is not required for the president to exercise this authority under the Constitution.\"",
      "The case before the 4th Circuit also involved Mr. Trump and claims raised by James Rosemond, who is serving life sentences for numerous offenses arising from his role in drug trafficking and a murder. Rosemond claimed that Mr. Trump told two supporters, former Cleveland Browns running back Jim Brown and his wife, during a telephone call in December 2020 that his sentence had been commuted.",
      "But Rosemond was not among those who received written clemency warrants during Mr. Trump's first term, and his petition was listed after the president left the White House in January 2021 as \"pending.\"",
      "The judges who issued the decision are Steven Agee, appointed by Bush, Stephanie Thacker, named by Obama, and Allison Jones Rushing, nominated by Mr. Trump.",

    "published": "Mon, 17 Mar 2025 09:43:31 -0400",
    "summary": "Mahmoud Khalil, a former Columbia University student who is a green card holder, is being threatened with deportation.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Sunday that Mahmoud Khalil, an activist who is being detained by federal immigration authorities, is \"going to leave \u2014 and so are others.\"",
      "\"We're going to keep doing it,\" Rubio said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",
      "Mahmoud Khalil, a 30-year-old who was born in Syria to Palestinian parents, served as a negotiator on behalf of students during Columbia University's 2024 student encampment protests. He was arrested March 8 by Immigration and Customs Enforcement and detained in New Jersey before being transported to a federal detention facility in Louisiana. Officials were acting on a State Department order to revoke his student visa, Khalil's attorney said, but when they were informed that he was in the U.S. as a permanent resident with a green card, the agent said they were revoking that, too.",
      "Rubio said after the arrest that the administration would be revoking the visas and green cards \"of Hamas supporters in America so they can be deported.\"",
      "On Sunday, when asked whether he could provide evidence to support a link to terrorism, or whether Khalil was simply espousing a controversial political point of view, Rubio cited news footage, saying \"these guys take over entire buildings, they vandalize colleges.\"",
      "\"Negotiating on behalf of people that took over a campus, that vandalized buildings,\" Rubio said. \"That's a crime in and of itself, that they're involved in being a negotiator, the spokesperson.\"",
      "The secretary of state explained the thought process, which he called \"very simple,\" outlining that when someone entered the U.S. with a visa \u2014 whether as a student or tourist \u2014 they do so as a \"guest.\"",
      "\"And if you tell us, when you apply for a visa, 'I'm coming to the U.S. to participate in pro-Hamas events,' that runs counter to the foreign policy interest of the United States of America,\" Rubio said. \"If you had told us that you were going to do that, we never would have given you the visa.\"",
      "Neither Rubio nor the White House have provided evidence that Khalil supported Hamas in any way other than support for the protesters at Columbia University, and Khalil's lawyers say he is being punished for exercising his right to protest. Khalil's attorneys have filed a motion to dismiss the case, and declare that his arrest and detention violate the First Amendment and the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.",
      "A top ICE official in New York said in a court filing on Thursday that ICE charged Khalil as \"removable \u2026 in that the Secretary of State has reasonable grounds to believe that his presence or activities in the United States would have potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences for the United States.\"",
      "Rubio said that if Khalil had said he planned to enter the U.S. to become a \"spokesperson and one of the leaders of a movement that's going to turn one of your allegedly elite colleges upside down,\" preventing students from attending classes and resulting in vandalization of buildings, \"we never would have let him in.\"",
      "More broadly, Rubio said the administration \"every day now\" is approving visa revocations, suggesting that if the visa led to a green card, that has implications for the green card process as well.",
      "Asked whether people with pro-Palestinian views would be the sole target having their visas revoked, Rubio said members of the Tren de Aragua prison gang would be targeted as well, adding that \"we don't want terrorists in America.\"",
      "\"We don't want people in our country that are going to be committing crimes and undermining our national security or the public safety,\" Rubio said. \"It's that simple.\"",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-south-africa-ambassador-ebrahim-rasool-expelled/",
    "published": "Mon, 17 Mar 2025 08:28:00 -0400",
    "summary": "Marco Rubio declared South African envoy Ebrahim Rasool persona non grata and accused him of being a \"race-baiting politician who hates America.\"",
    "story": [
      "Johannesburg\u00a0\u2014 The Trump administration expelled South Africa's Ambassador Ebrahim Rasool on Friday, giving him 72 hours to leave the country. In a social media post, Secretary of State Marco Rubio called Rasool a \"race-baiting politician who hates America\" and President Trump.",
      "In a diplomatic notice, the Department of State said that it would no longer recognize Ambassador Rasool as a \"member of the [South African] mission from today, March 17,\" adding that \"his privileges and immunities will cease\" and that he was \"persona non grata\" in the United States.",
      "The expulsion came after Rasool, during a webinar hosted by the South African Mapungubwe Institute for Strategic Reflection, accused Mr. Trump of pursuing policies and practices that the diplomat characterized as \"a white supremacist response to growing demographic diversity in the United States.\"",
      "Rasool was expelled just two months after he arrived in Washington to serve as his country's envoy.",
      "\"Improving our relationship with the United States of America is a priority for us,\" South Africa's President Cyril Ramaphosa told journalists on Monday, calling the U.S. \"our second largest trading partner after China.\"",
      "\"We have noted the displeasure that has been expressed by the United States, particularly about the remarks he made,\" Ramaphosa said, adding that he expected Rasool to return to Pretoria and \"give me a full report.\"",
      "It's the latest in a string of incidents that have seen a marked deterioration of diplomatic relations between the U.S. and South Africa since Mr. Trump took office for his second term in January.",
      "Speaking on South African television on Saturday, the country's foreign minister said the decision by the U.S. to expel Rasool, who previously campaigned against the country's racist Apartheid regime, was \"unprecedented and regrettable,\" before adding: \"We need to find time to engage with each other behind closed doors, where the U.S. can raise their concerns with us, and we can also raise our concerns with them, because it is not helpful to engage in megaphone and Twitter diplomacy.\"",
      "A pro-Hamas, anti-Israel ambassador to the U.S.?",
      "Rasool's appointment to head the South African diplomatic mission in the U.S., by the ruling African National Congress party, was a contentious one even before he arrived in Washington, dividing opinions within the country's new Government of National Unity (GNU). The ANC had to build the coalition government to maintain power after failing to win a significant enough majority in the last elections to govern on its own.",
      "\"Rasool's appointment was opposed by all of the other political parties in the GNU, and was the first large point of contention between the parties,\" Wiliam Gumede, a professor of public management at Witwatersrand University in Johannesburg, explained to CBS News.",
      "\"Eventually, the non-ANC partners caved in,\" Gumede said, which led to Rasool getting the job.",
      "\"He is perceived to be pro-Iran and Hamas, as well as strongly anti-Israel, which is largely why it was felt he was the wrong choice for the ambassador post,\" Gumede told CBS News.",
      "Rasool has long been a controversial figure in South African politics, having spoken favorably of the U.S.- and Israeli-designated terrorist organization Hamas, and even\u00a0boasting of his ties with the group's leadership. He is a strong backer of the case South Africa filed with the United Nations' top court, accusing Israel of committing genocide in the Gaza Strip. Israel has vehemently rejected that accusation, arguing that its war in the Palestinian enclave has been a legitimate self-defense against Hamas following the group's Oct. 7, 2023 terrorist attack.",
      "Gumede said he believed the way for Ramaphosa to ease the tension with Washington was for the South African president to publicly label Rasool's comments \"unacceptable,\" while also giving a detailed acknowledgement of how important relations and aid from the U.S. are to South Africa.",
      "The analyst said if such measures were not taken by Pretoria to smooth the relationship, the impasse could deepen, with significant implications for South Africa.",
      "\"I fear the next step steps could be targeted economic sanctions against South Africa, which would mean we are in danger of losing 300,000 to 400,000 direct jobs in the country, as well as hundreds of thousands more jobs through indirect channels,\" he said.",
      "\"It's not too late,\" Gumede added. \"President Trump has a lot of South Africans in his inner circle. We need to engage them and put together a team of non-ANC partners from the Government of National Unity to travel to the U.S. and engage the Trump team. The relationship is simply too important not to.\"",

    "story": [
      "The Trump administration and Israel approached the governments of Sudan and Somalia, and have also been interested in Syria, as potential places to resettle Palestinians from Gaza, according to three sources familiar with the effort.",
      "The idea of Palestinian resettlement in another country is one of several options the Trump team is chewing over as part of the U.S. president's larger goal of ending Israel's war with Hamas in Gaza and rebuilding the devastated Palestinian enclave.",
      "\"Nobody is expelling any Palestinians,\" President Trump said Wednesday, when the Irish Prime Minister was asked during the two leaders' Oval Office meeting by a Voice of America reporter about the president's controversial remarks in February when he suggested taking ownership of Gaza to rebuild it.",
      "Mr. Trump made the remarks during a Feb. 4 press conference alongside Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, saying Gaza could be the \"Riviera of the Middle East.\"",
      "\"\u200aWe should go to other countries of interest with humanitarian hearts, and there are many of them that want to do this, and build various domains that will ultimately be occupied by the 1.8 million Palestinians living in Gaza, ending the death and destruction,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "A combination of Israeli and U.S. officials communicated to Sudan and Somalia, two diplomatic sources confirmed to CBS News. Senior far-right Israeli government officials have already been calling for Palestinians to migrate from the enclave. Mr. Trump's remarks have only emboldened Israel to reach out to other countries to explore opportunities for Palestinian resettlement, one source said.",
      "Three sources familiar with Mr. Trump's idea of resettling Gazans to another country told CBS News that his administration and Israel have also been interested in Syria. One source familiar with the Trump administration's Middle East policy said that the administration has attempted outreach to Syria's new interim government via a third-party interlocutor. Another source from the region told CBS News that Syria's government had been approached, but it was unclear whether there had been any response from Syria to the outreach.",
      "A senior Syrian official told CBS News that they are unaware of any outreach to their government by Israel or the U.S. about resettlement of Gazans.",
      "Dahir Hassan, Somalia's ambassador to the U.S., told CBS News that \"neither the U.S. administration nor Israeli authorities have approached the Somali government regarding any proposed relocation of Palestinians to Somalia.\" Hassan also cited concern that \"the dissemination of such unverified information risks fueling recruitment propaganda for extremist groups like ISIS and Al-Shabaab, potentially exacerbating security challenges in the region.\"",
      "The Sudanese government has not responded to a CBS News' request for comment.",
      "Syria's fledgling interim government is just three months old, after toppling Bashar al-Assad and his brutal regime which held an iron fist over the Syrian people for decades. The Arab northeast African nation of Sudan is currently embroiled in civil war and a refugee crisis while suffering pockets of famine. Tens of thousands of Sudanese refugees have sought asylum in Israel over the last two decades, only to be detained in the country's desert-based detention centers or left to live without any formal status. The East African country of Somalia is a fragile, formerly failed state where the militant Islamist group Al-Shabaab continues to wage a deadly insurgency.",
      "Since his Feb. 4 news conference, Mr. Trump has suggested Palestinians would have a choice on whether to leave but also indicated that their departure from Gaza could be permanent. In a Fox News interview several days later he said, \"We'll build beautiful communities, safe communities, could be five, six, could be two. But we'll build safe communities a little bit away from where they (the Palestinians) are.\" In the same interview, he said that Palestinians wouldn't have the right to return to Gaza under his plan because the enclave \"is not habitable\" and won't be for years to come.",
      "The United Nations reported in January that over 90% of housing units in Gaza are either damaged or destroyed and 1.9 million Gazan civilians have been displaced. Gaza's health ministry says more than 48,000 Palestinians have been killed in the war between Israel and Hamas, which began after the Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist attack in which Hamas killed more than 1,000 Israelis and took roughly 100 more hostage.",
      "Multiple Arab governments, the United Nations and some Democratic lawmakers, quickly denounced Mr. Trump's idea of emptying out Gaza with some defining the idea as ethnic cleansing. Instead, Arab leaders endorsed an alternative Egyptian post-war construction plan for Gaza last week, but the Trump administration and Israel were both quick to reject it, again citing that the Gaza Strip is uninhabitable.",
      "Former President Joe Biden's administration had been sending U.S. officials on a regular basis to meet with the new Syrian government in Damascus in the lead-up to Mr. Trump's inauguration when the visits stopped.\u00a0 Syria's new leader Ahmed al-Sharaa, formerly known as Abu Mohammad al-Jolani, was quick to condemn Mr. Trump's remarks in February, saying that the U.S. president's plan \"is a serious crime that will ultimately fail\". It is unclear what the Trump administration's overall policy toward the new Syrian government will be.",
      "\"The Trump administration should engage directly with the new government in Damascus, particularly after the agreement between Damascus and the SDF (the U.S.-allied Syrian Democratic Forces). And to ensure that Iran never again gains a foothold in Syria, for the true, enduring defeat of ISIS, and to conduct a full withdrawal of U.S. forces in the right way unlike what unfolded in Afghanistan,\" Mouaz Moustafa, executive director of the Washington-based advocacy and humanitarian organization Syrian Emergency Task Force, told CBS News.",
      "Israel has conducted widespread airstrikes in Syria since December, on what it described as Assad regime weapons sites, and seized territory in the buffer zone between both countries. This past week, Israel struck inside a Damascus suburb, saying it was taking out the headquarters of the Islamic Jihad, an Iran-backed militant group that has a substantial foothold in Gaza and the occupied West Bank.",
      "A State Department spokesperson deferred to the Israeli government, and told CBS News that Middle East special envoy Steve Witkoff \"continues to work tirelessly towards either an extension of Phase One (of the Israel-Hamas ceasefire agreement) or an advance to Phase Two with these principles in mind\".",
      "The State Department also referred to remarks by Witkoff from a February Fox News interview in which he said, \"We need to explore new policy prescriptions that ultimately end up in a better life for Gazans and Palestinians.\"",
      "Witkoff also suggested in the same Fox interview that Gaza's entire Palestinian population could go to other Middle East-based Arab nations and other countries beyond the region: \"I think that the president's solution is: how do we address where two million people can go? And I think the obvious answers are: in some respects, Egypt, in some respects, Jordan; but in some respects other countries who have called us up and voluntarily said this is a humanitarian effort, we want to help you\".",
      "Asked by \"Face the Nation\" moderator Margaret Brennan on Sunday about whether the Trump administration is talking to other countries about relocation of two million Palestinians in Gaza, Witkoff said again \"I think we're exploring, Margaret, all alternatives and options that lead to a better life for Gazans. And, by the way, for the people of Israel. So we're exploring all of those things.\"",
      "Millions of displaced Palestinians already live in surrounding Arab countries as refugees, including in Jordan, Syria, Lebanon and Egypt. Far-right Israeli ministers have increasingly called for moving Palestinians in Gaza and also in the West Bank off their land as part of the extreme view it would fulfill a Biblical claim by Jews to the land, and increase Israel's security.",
      "The Israeli government, the White House and its National Security Council all declined to respond to multiple CBS News requests for comment.",
      "Trump's son-in-law and former advisor Jared Kushner first suggested that Gaza's \"waterfront property could be very valuable, if people would focus on building up livelihoods\" during an on-camera discussion at Harvard University in February 2024.",

I'm wondering, how long will this campaign last and will it involve ground forces?",
      "MARCO RUBIO (U.S. Secretary of State): Well, first of all, the problem here is that this is a very important shipping lane. And in the last year- and-a-half, last 18 months, the Houthis have struck or attacked 174 Naval vessels of the United States, attacking the U.S. Navy directly 174 times. And 145 times, they have attacked commercial shipping.",
      "So we basically have a band of pirates with guided precision anti-ship weaponry and exacting a toll system in one of the most important shipping lanes in the world. That's just not sustainable. We are not going to have these people controlling which ships can go through and which ones cannot.",
      "And so your question is, how long will this go on? It will go on until they no longer have the capability to do that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, what does U.S. intelligence tell us at this point? Because the U.S. had been conducting strikes for some time, but has not stopped the Houthis.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: No.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So what's going to be different right now? Do you have more fidelity in the intelligence that would make this more successful?",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Well, those strikes were retaliation strikes. So they launch one missile, we hit the missile launcher, or we sent something to do it. This is not a message. This is not a one-off.",
      "This is an effort to deny them the ability to continue to constrict and control shipping. And it's just not going to happen. We're not going to have these guys, these people with weapons able to tell us where our ships can go, where the ships of all the world can go, by the way. It's not just the U.S. We're doing the world a favor.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: We're doing the entire world a favor by getting rid of these guys and their ability to strike global shipping. That's the mission here. And it will continue until that's carried out. That never happened before. The Biden administration didn't do that.",
      "All the Biden administration would do is, they would respond to an attack. These guys would launch one rocket, we'd hit the rocket launcher. That's it. This is an effort to take away their ability to control global shipping in that part of the world. That's just not going to happen anymore.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And it could\u2026",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: So, this will continue until that's finished.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: It could involve ground raids?",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Well, those are military decisions to be made, but I have heard no talk of ground raids. I don't think there's a necessity for it right now.",
      "I can tell you that, as of last night, some of the key people involved in those missile launches are no longer with us. And I can tell you that some of the facilities that they used are no longer existing. And that will continue.",
      "Look, it's \u2013 bottom line, easy way to understand it, OK, these guys are able to control what ships can go through there. They have attacked the U.S. Navy 174 times. They have attacked the United States Navy. We're not going to have people sitting around with the missiles attacking the U.S. Navy. It's not going to happen, not under President Trump.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The president also referenced Iran in his statement. Iran provides some support for the Houthis, as you know.",
      "Put this in context for me, because U.S. intelligence has been suggesting for some time that Israel has the desire and intent to conduct an attack on Iran's developing nuclear program in the coming months. President Trump has extended an offer for negotiations.",
      "Have you heard anything back from Iran? Is this strike in Yemen a signal to Iran?",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: This strike in Yemen is about their ability, the ability of the Houthis to strike global shipping and attack the U.S. Navy, and their willingness to do it, 174 times against the U.S. Navy, 145 sometimes against global shipping. That's what the strike is about.",
      "What we can't ignore and the reason why the president mentioned Iran is because the Iranians have supported the Houthis. They have provided them intelligence. They have provided them guidance. They have provided them weaponry. I mean, there's no way the Houthis, OK, the Houthis, would have the ability to do this kind of thing unless they had support from Iran.",
      "And so this was a message to Iran. Don't keep supporting them, because then you will also be responsible for what they are doing in attacking Navy ships, in attacking global shipping.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: They also get support from Russia, potentially, which you leveraged sanctions in regard to.",
      "But I want to ask you about tariffs, because you were just in Canada this past week. China is Canada's second biggest export market, Mexico's third. In this ongoing trade back and forth the U.S. is having, isn't there a risk that China will ultimately be the winner? If it's too costly to deal with the United States, won't they benefit?",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Well, actually, China and Canada are involved in a mini-trade war right now. In fact, the Chinese have imposed a bunch of tariffs, reciprocal or retaliatory tariffs, on Canada after Canada imposed tariffs on them.",
      "So here's the way everyone needs to understand this, OK? The president rightfully believes that the balance of global trade is completely off kilter. For 30 or 40 years, we have allowed countries to treat us unfairly in global trade, much of it during the Cold War because we wanted them to be rich and prosperous because they were our allies in the Cold War.",
      "But now that has to change. You look at the European Union. The European Union's economy is about the same size as ours. It's not a low-wage economy. It's very comparable to ours in terms of its composition and so forth. Why do they have a trade surplus with us?",
      "So what the president is saying is two things. Number one, there are critical industries like aluminum, like steel, like semiconductors, like automobile manufacturing, that he rightfully believes, President Trump rightfully believes, the U.S. needs to have a domestic capability. And the way you protect those industries and build that capability is by ensuring that there's economic incentives to produce in the United States.",
      "The second is global. And that is, we are going to put tariffs on countries reciprocal to what they impose on us. And so this is a global \u2013 it's not against Canada. It's not against Mexico. It's not against the E.U. It's everybody.",
      "And then, from that new baseline of fairness and reciprocity, we will engage potentially in bilateral negotiations with countries around the world on new trade arrangements that make sense for both sides. Fairness. But, right now, it's not fair. We're going to reset the baseline and then we can enter into these bilateral agreements potentially with countries so that our trade is fair.",
      "What's not going to continue is \u2013 of course, these countries are upset.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So this is all just about leverage to get bilateral not free trade \u2013 not North American free trade deals?",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: No, no, it's not leverage.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Renegotiation?",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: It's fairness. It's resetting baseline fairness. And then from there we can work on deals and so forth because they will have products we don't make. We have products they don't make. That's where trade works the best.",
      "It has to be free, but it has to be fair in that country. And, right now, it's only free on one side and it's not fair for the other side.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, you know, sir\u2026",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: It's an unsustainable position.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2026 the ad hoc nature of these policy announcements and pullbacks are causing concern in the marketplace, as we saw this past week.",
      "So I heard you describe what seemed like a strategy to get to negotiations on a bilateral front. You also seemed to negotiate \u2013 you say this was national security-minded.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But then we also see comments by the president of like 200 percent tariffs on champagne. That's not a critical industry for the United States. That seems more emotional.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: No, that means \u2013 that's called retaliation. That's what happens in these trade exchanges. They're going to increase tariffs on \u2013 they already have high tariffs. They're going to add more to their tariffs? Fine.",
      "Then we will have to find something to \u2013 I mean, you tell me. I mean, Canada's going after whiskey and orange juice. And, I mean\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: In retaliation.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Yes, exactly. So that sounds pretty petty to me as well. So what's the difference?",
      "The point is, I get it. I understand why these countries don't like it, because the status quo of trade is good for them. It benefits them. They like the status quo. We don't like the status quo. We are going to set a new status quo. And then we can negotiate something, if they want to, that is fair for both sides.",
      "But what we have now cannot continue. We have deindustrialized this country, deindustrialized the United States of America. There are things we can no longer make and we have to be able to make in order to be safe as a country and in order to have jobs. That's why we had a Rust Belt. That's why we have suffered all these important jobs that once sustained entire communities wiped out by trade that basically sent these factories, these jobs, this industrial capability to other places.",
      "That cannot and will not continue.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: I don't know \u2013 President Trump. This is no mystery. He's been talking about this since the 1980s, actually, even before he was a political figure.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: This is going to happen, and it's going to happen now.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about Russia.",
      "You said Envoy Steve Witkoff's meeting with Vladimir Putin that happened last week would answer the fundamental question of whether we're moving towards a cease-fire or whether Putin is using a delay tactic. You spoke with Sergey Lavrov, the foreign minister, yesterday. Is this a delay tactic?",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Well, I think that was a promising meeting. As I have said repeatedly, we're not going to negotiate this in the public. Hopefully, we will have something to announce at some point fairly soon. I can't guarantee that, but I certainly think the meeting was promising, The exchange was promising.",
      "I don't take away from Steve's meeting, from Ambassador Witkoff's meeting, negativity. There are some challenges. This is a complex three-year war that's been ongoing along a very long military front with a lot of complexity to it. So, no one's claiming that it's easy.",
      "But I want everyone to understand here's the plan. Plan A is, get the shooting to stop, so that we can move to plan B, phase two, which is have everybody at a table, maybe not \u2013 maybe with some shuttle diplomacy, to figure out a way to permanently end this war in a way that's enduring and that respects everybody's needs and so forth.",
      "No one is saying that that second part is easy, but we can't get even to that second part until we get past the first part. It's hard to negotiate an enduring end to a war as long as they're shooting at each other.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: And so the president wants a cease-fire, and that's what we're working on.",
      "Assuming we can get that done \u2013 and that won't be easy in and of itself \u2013 we move to the second phase, which is negotiating something more enduring and permanent. That will be hard. It will involve a lot of hard work, concessions from both sides, but it has to happen. This war cannot continue.",
      "The president has been clear about that, and he's doing everything he can to bring it to an end.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. We will talk about that later in the program as well with Envoy Witkoff.",
      "I want to ask you about a decision you made to revoke a student visa for someone at Columbia University this past week. \"The Wall Street Journal\" Editorial Board writes: \"The administration needs to be careful it's targeting real promoters of terrorism, not breaking the great promise of a green card by deporting anyone with controversial political views.\"",
      "Can you substantiate any form of material support for terrorism specifically to Hamas from this Columbia student? Or was it simply that he was espousing a controversial political point of view?",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Well, not just the student. We're going to do more. In fact, we \u2013 every day now, we're approving visa revocations, and if that visa led to a green card, the green card process as well.",
      "And here's why. It's very simple. When you apply to enter the United States and you get a visa, you are a guest and you're coming as a student, you're coming as a tourist or what have you. And, in it, you have to make certain assertions. And if you tell us when you apply for a visa, I'm coming to the U.S. to participate in pro-Hamas events, that runs counter to the foreign policy interest of the United States of America.",
      "It's that simple. So you lied. You came \u2013 if you had told us that you were going to do that, we never would have given you the visa. Now you're here. Now you do it. You lied to us. You're out. It's that simple. It's that straightforward.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But is there any \u2013 but is there any evidence of a link to terrorism, or is it just his point of view?",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Sure. Yes, they take over \u2013 I mean, do you not \u2013 I mean, you should watch the news. These guys take over entire buildings.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We covered it intensely.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: They vandalized colleges. They shut down colleges. Well, then you should know that this is\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I'm asking about the specific justification for the revocation of his visa. Was there any evidence of material support for terrorism?",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Well, this specific individual was the spokesperson, was the negotiator on \u2013 negotiating on behalf of people that took over a campus, that vandalized buildings? Negotiating over what? That's a crime, in and of itself, that they're involved and being a negotiator, the spokesperson, this, that, the other.",
      "We don't want \u2013 we don't need these people in our country. We never should have allowed him in, in the first place. If he had told us, I'm going over there and I'm going over there to become the spokesperson and one of the leaders of a movement that's going to turn one of your allegedly elite colleges upside down, people can't even go to school, library \u2013 the buildings being vandalized, we never would have let him in.",
      "We never would have let him in to begin with.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: And now that he's doing it and he's here, he's going to leave. And so are others. And we're going to keep doing it.",
      "We are\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: To\u2026",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: And, by the way, I find it ironic that a lot of these people out there defending the First Amendment speech, alleged free speech rights of these Hamas sympathizers\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes?",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: .. they had no problem, OK, pressuring social media to censor American political speech.",
      "So I think it's ironic and hypocritical. But the bottom line is this. If you are in this country to promote Hamas, to promote terrorist organizations, to participate in vandalism, to participate in acts of rebellion\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: .. and riots on campus, we never would have let you in if we had known that. And now that we know it, you're going to leave.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Is it only pro-Palestinian people who are going to have their visas revoked or are other points of view as well?",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: No, I think anybody who's here in favor \u2013 look, we want to get rid of Tren de Aragua gang members.",
      "They're terrorists too. I \u2013 we \u2013 the president designated them\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: \u2026 asked me to designate, and I did, as a terrorist organization. We want to get rid of them as well.",
      "You \u2013 we don't want terrorists in America. I don't know how hard that is to understand. We want people \u2013 we don't want people in our country that are going to be\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: \u2026 committing crimes and undermining our national security or the public safety. It's that simple\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: \u2026 especially people that are here as guests. That is what a visa is.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: I don't know what we have gotten it in our head that a visa is some sort of birthright. It is not. It is a visitor into our country.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: And if you violate the terms of your visitation, you are going to leave.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK, Secretary Rubio, I'd like to have you back, talk to you about a lot more on your plate another time, but we have to leave it there.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Thank you.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Face the Nation will be back in a minute.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We go now to President Trump's special envoy to the Middle East, Steve Witkoff, who joins us this morning from Miami Beach.",
      "Welcome back to Face the Nation, Ambassador.",
      "STEVE WITKOFF (U.S. Special Envoy to the Middle East): Thank you. Thank you, Margaret. Thanks for having me.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So you just heard Secretary of State Rubio talk about these efforts to broker a cease-fire. You were the man face-to-face with Vladimir Putin.",
      "I wonder what your answer to the question is in regard to whether this is a delay tactic or whether Vladimir Putin is sincere in seeking a cease-fire.",
      "STEVE WITKOFF: Well, I was there for quite some time, Margaret.",
      "And I agree with the secretary's assessment. We made a lot of progress in that meeting. It was a meeting that was \u2013 it could have been as long as four hours, but it was certainly at least three. We talked about a lot of specifics. And I point to the large gap that existed between Ukraine and Russia prior to the inauguration and where we are today.",
      "We have narrowed the issues between both of these parties, making a lot of progress, in my opinion, and I think that meeting underscores that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So I heard you say on another program this morning that you do expect Presidents Trump and Putin to speak this week. Is that a decision-making call, or is this just next steps?",
      "STEVE WITKOFF: Well, I would assume that they have a \u2013 they have a real relationship from the president's first term. They have talked already after the first visit that I had with President Putin.",
      "And I think this is going to be a very positive and constructive call between the two men, between the two presidents.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And decisions will be made on whether to move forward with this 30-day cease-fire that the U.S. and Ukraine have agreed to, but Russia, at least publicly, has not?",
      "STEVE WITKOFF: Well, President Trump is the ultimate decision-maker, our decision-maker, and President Putin for the country of Russia is their decision-maker.",
      "I think it's a very positive sign that the two of them will be talking at some point. I think that's \u2013 that's showing that there's positive momentum, that there's a \u2013 an inclination on \u2013 on the part of both countries, and, by the way, this includes Ukraine as well, to get to a long-term, durable peace here.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, France's president publicly said yesterday that, in his country's view, Russia is not genuine in seeking peace. They're intensifying the fighting.",
      "We saw Vladimir Putin on television this week dressed in military fatigues. He made public comments about wanting to resolve root causes of the war. How different was his message in private?",
      "STEVE WITKOFF: Well, I \u2013 look, I don't \u2013 I don't know what President Macron said.",
      "I think it's unfortunate when people make those sort of assessments, and they don't have necessarily firsthand knowledge. But I'm not going to comment on what he said, because I don't know what he said.",
      "I know what I heard, the body language I witnessed. I saw a constructive effort over a long period of time to \u2013 to discuss the specifics of what's going on in the field. There's a 2,000-kilometer border between these two countries, and they are facing \u2013 shooting each other and facing each other across that 2,000-mile border.",
      "That's a very, very complicated cease-fire, and yet everybody is committed to have that discussion. Here we are, in the throes of having that discussion, with the Russians talking about sending technical teams, the United States sending technical teams, a meeting in Saudi Arabia with our national security adviser, Mike Waltz, and Secretary of State Rubio that had a lot of positivity attached to it, my meeting, which I \u2013 I regard as promising.",
      "I think those are all very, very good trends, and hopefully inform on the possibility of a near-term peace agreement.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, beyond the cease-fire, a peace agreement? you're already talking about technicalities in terms of territory that would be given up?",
      "STEVE WITKOFF: Well, I \u2013 what I \u2013 what I'm saying, the technical \u2013 what I'm saying is that a cease-fire involves how to get people to not be fighting with each other over a 2,000-kilometer border. That's \u2013 that's 1,200 miles.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "STEVE WITKOFF: Nor does that include a main area of confrontation, which is Kursk. And so there's different battlefield conditions.",
      "We've got to discuss that. There are regions that we all know the Russians are focused on. There is a nuclear reactor that supplies quite a bit of electricity to \u2013 to the country of Ukraine. That's got to be dealt with. There's access to ports. There's the Black Sea potential agreement.",
      "There's \u2013 there's just \u2013 there's so many elements, Margaret, to the implementation of a cease-fire here. And I compare it sometimes to Gaza. Gaza is a finite, defined space as compared to the \u2013 the battle \u2013 where the battle is being fought in Ukraine-Russia.",
      "So this is a much more complicated situation, and yet no one is throwing their hands up in the air. What they are doing is, they are digging in, and everybody is committed, all stakeholders, including the Europeans, to doing everything we need to do to get to a successful resolution here.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You mentioned Gaza.",
      "I want to ask you what specifics you are looking at when it comes to relocating the two million Palestinians in Gaza. In the past, you've mentioned Egypt. You've mentioned Jordan. Are you talking to other countries at this point about resettling?",
      "STEVE WITKOFF: I mean, I think we're exploring, Margaret, all alternatives and options that leads to a better life for Gazans and, by the way, for the people of Israel.",
      "So we're exploring all of those things. But, right now, what's right in front of us, is coming to some sort of resolution on this conflict. And the recent experience that we had at the Arab summit, where we spent 7.5 hours with leaders of various Arab countries, the recent experience we had with Hamas' response was not encouraging.",
      "Now, to me, we put a very sensible proposal on the table that was intended as a bridge to get to a final discussion and final resolution here that would have incorporated some sort of demilitarization of Hamas, which must happen \u2013 that's a red line for the Israelis \u2013 and maybe could have led to a long-term peace resolution here.",
      "And yet Hamas \u2013 Hamas came up with their own construct\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "STEVE WITKOFF: \u2026 essentially disavowed what we discussed.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "STEVE WITKOFF: And, to my mind, that was a pretty poor ending.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "STEVE WITKOFF: And I \u2013 I hope they reconsider, because the alternative is not so good for them.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Understood.",

      "Welcome back.",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM (R-SC): Thank you.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Near miss with the government shutdown, sir. And I - I thought we'd be talking about a lot of domestic policy, but President Trump's point of view seems to be overseas in these - in this past week. Certainly a lot of action.",
      "I looked at the last time we spoke. You were advocating for President Trump to bomb Iran. You said, there's a one in trillion chance you'll degrade the Iranian nuclear program through diplomacy. Since then, President Trump has offered negotiations. Are you softening your stance?",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Well, I don't mind negotiating, as long as we get the outcome that we all desire. They can't have a nuclear bomb. So, I think there is a one in trillion chance the ayatollah would ever genuinely give up his quest for a nuclear weapon. He wants a nuclear weapon to use it. He wants to destroy Israel, kill all the Jews. He's a religious Nazi. He wants to purify Islam and drive us out of the region.",
      "Yes, I think he - I think he's a fanatical, religious Nazi who would use a bomb. But let's talk to him. And if he really is sincere, give up enrichment. There are 40 countries in this world that have nuclear power but don't enrich. There's no commercial purpose for enriching uranium at 60 percent. He has enough to make six bombs at 60 percent. So, turn that all over to the international community. We'll pay for it. Get out of the enrichment business and we'll help you with your nuclear power program. If you'll do all those things, then I will have been proven wrong.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That's a long - that's a long to-do list. And so far no - no indication that he's taking the offer.",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Not really. He's - if you don't want to bomb, give up enrichment.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: You don't need enrichment for nuclear power. You do need enrichment to make a bomb. It's not that hard.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Understood.",
      "We did see additional Russian strikes in Ukraine overnight. You have been an advocate for Ukraine.",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Yes.",

So, if Putin is sincere about wanting peace, accept the ceasefire on the same terms as Ukraine and quit trying to mix the two, ceasefire and peace deal.",

But we're talking about a ceasefire and we're talking about peace. We weren't talking about that in the last administration. But, to me, Putin's a predator. The best way to judge Putin is not in a three hour meeting but 30 years of action. And I see no indication that he's going to stop being a predator against Ukraine until the pain is too large.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you think Vladimir Putin benefits from the U.S. decision to try to shutter some of the advocates for the free press and agents of the free press, like Radio Free Europe, Radio Free Asia and Voice of America? As you know, there was an executive order to try to dismantle them.",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Yes. Yes, I don't know what value these - these ideas have in the 21st century. At the end of the day, I'll look and evaluate where the voice of America really is, Radio Free Europe, I know it made a difference in the Cold War. People told us that.

I think Jack Smith's effort to prosecute President Trump for January 6th was politically motivated.

That they made up bogus charges and they proceeded in a fashion that was designed to destroy him politically and personally. I believe that. And if these people involved pay a price, they got nobody but themselves to blame. That's what I believe.",

That this was an orchestrated effort and Biden only regretted they didn't do it sooner. So, it was politically motivated. And everybody with their fingerprints on it, I hope they pay a price.",

      "We were looking at the data. Michigan's lost more than 220,000 manufacturing jobs over the past 30 years. The vice president was out in Michigan this week. He says this is \u2013 this entire Trump strategy is about industrial resurgence. Is that landing where you live?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE DEBBIE DINGELL: So, I'm somebody that answers this differently than many. I believe that tariffs are a tool in the toolbox. And if you'll recall, I said Donald Trump would win in 2016, and nobody believed me. And I was right. And it was one issue. It was trade. NAFTA was one of the worst pieces of trade legislation in the history of this country. It sent tons of jobs overseas. And President Trump came in. I worked with him. We renegotiated it. We have the USMCA.",
      "The way that the tariffs are being done now is - it's made a ping-pong ball of the auto industry. I think they're a tool that we can look at. We need to using them against China. But I think they're being selectively applied. The domestic auto companies are complying. There's no way that in a month's time, when they have such an integrated inventory and production plan - production plants where a part will go over the border several times to make the changes that need to happen.",
      "So, I want to work with this administration. I think the 25 percent tariffs are too high. They're placing an unfair burden. Autos are a ping-pong ball in a big war. I want to bring manufacturing home. I want to bring supply chains home. We needed industrial policy. Tariffs are part of it. Let's just do it in a way that lets everybody plan for it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The automakers, the big three, called President Trump. That was partly how this April 2nd push-off of some of these tariffs happened, their persuasion.",

      "REPRESENTATIVE DEBBIE DINGELL: So, if everything were go right, which, like in this world does anything ever go right, it's going to take two to three years. Our - our suppliers, also, there are many - and, by the way, we need to immediately renegotiate USMCA. It's time to look at it. And I think we need to be treating Mexico and Canada as different trading partners. Next -",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You support this idea. Secretary Rubio was basically saying bilateral, not North America as a globe -",
      "REPRESENTATIVE DEBBIE DINGELL: Totally. I totally - Canada would never let China build a plant in China and then market it as a North American vehicle. And we need to make sure that that never happens. I'm totally on board on that.",
      "But right now, as we're talking about the aluminum and the steel tariffs, two - 60 percent of aluminum in this country - that's being used is be - coming in from Canada. You take a 25 percent tariff on that, the profit on automobiles is - is very small. It's not a big - the companies just can't eat that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE DEBBIE DINGELL: But we've got to figure it out. I am not against trade policy. We just have to do it in a way that doesn't - I - I don't believe Donald Trump wants to destroy the domestic auto industry. I think we all got to work together to keep the domestic auto industry strong. And even as we're doing Canada and Mexico, do you realize that Korea and Japan are still able - they brought 2.5 million vehicles in to - Korea, with no tariff, and Japan with 2.5, not treating everybody equally.",

Ultimately, Democrats, in the Senate, did vote with Republicans on this short-term funding deal.",

AFGE, who's employees were going to be impacted the most, were very torn about what to do because concerned about their employees. Who I'm meeting with daily when I'm out there. Came out against supporting it because they felt like they were already being harmed. There was already just the license for DOGE to go ahead and do whatever it wants. They're not including Congress, not abiding with - people are being hurt.",

If you're home, my town halls look like a Republican town hall. I'm not taking it personally. People are scared. They want to see us do something.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, you have, in your state, the Port of Baltimore. One of the country's largest ports. The president has put all these tariffs in place, teed them up, and on April 2nd is poised to enact 25 percent tariffs on goods from Canada and Mexico. Do you have any idea when you will see the impact on shipping volume, what the impact on your state's economy will be?",
      "GOVERNOR WES MOORE: We're already seeing the impacts of these - of these - of these disastrous and frankly not very well thought out policies when it comes to tariffs. You know, tariffs are a tool. They're not an ideology. But this administration is using it like an ideology. And so, while these decisions are being made - made not with us, they're being made to us, we're already seeing how this is going to have a significant impact on the Port of Baltimore. It's also seeing how the tariff policies are having disastrous impact on our farmers over in the eastern shore, on our chicken farmers in the eastern shore. This lack of predictability, this erratic behavior and this - and the indecisive decision making that's being made is already having very real impact on cost. It's having very real impact on our businesses and our small businesses. It's having a very real impact on our economic engines and American competitive, as well as our national security. And so, these are the type of things, this erratic behavior is the things that people were concerned about and we are now seeing in real time in our states.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, your state was one of 20 that decided to legally challenge the Trump administration on the decision to dismiss 1,300 workers at the Education Department. I'm wondering, as you sit there, how do you choose which issues to fight legally, and is litigation the Democrats' only tool here?",
      "GOVERNOR WES MOORE: Well, it's not. I mean then you look at the - at the flurry of executive actions and executive orders that have been laid out by this administration thus far, they really fall into three different categories. It's - it's either ineffective, it is performative, or it is illegal, right? Those are the three buckets that all of these executive actions are falling under.",
      "And the ones that are illegal, we are going to take legal action to make sure that there are legal consequences for making these decisions that, frankly, the president of the United States does not have the authority to make unilaterally.",
      "And so, when we talk about the different tools that we have, just in the past week alone, you know, I signed - I signed executive action, executive orders focusing on supporting law enforcement and our police officers and our firefighters and giving them pay raises because, on the federal side, we've seen continued attacks on our public servants and our law enforcement and the cutting of first responders like FEMA.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: On Friday, President Trump went to the Justice Department. And while he was there, he said that the FBI headquarters will no longer be moved from Washington, D.C., out to the state of Maryland. He called Maryland a liberal state, and he said he's going to stop it.",
      "I know your office thought this was going to bring in 7,500 new jobs. Have you reached out to the White House to try to persuade them not to take it away?",
      "GOVERNOR WES MOORE: Here - here's the ironic thing about it is, I found out about that announcement from the president via the news. That goes to show the level of partnership that this administration is - is - that they - that they have and they would like from our nation's governors and from our nation's chief executives.",
      "And so - so the thing that we know about this is, this is a direct attack and a direct assault on law enforcement, a direct attack on the FBI, because Maryland is the place - and we've gone - we went through this process not just for these past couple years since I've been the governor, but for the past decade, where Maryland - where Maryland won this - this element, this competition, fair and square, quantitively, where we showed that we could be at a place that it was the only site ready place to build, build ready site. So, the building is ready to go in the state of Maryland, but the president has just decided to politicize it by talking about, but he doesn't want it to go to a liberal state. We cannot continue to politicize national security when it is too important to the people who are serving us.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Have you called him? Have you called the White House?",
      "GOVERNOR WES MOORE: We've tried calling the White House before and - and there - there's - there's no response. And - and, frankly, it just highlights the fact that, again, I found out about this announcement via news break. I did not find out about this announcement from the White House.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you believe it? But you believe it?",
      "GOVERNOR WES MOORE: Do I believe the announcement?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "GOVERNOR WES MOORE: Well, I believe that the president thinks he has the authority to do this. But I also think that that falls into line of a collection of other things that the president does not have the authority to do. Congress is the one who actually allocates the capital towards where federal agencies are going to go. And so, I believe the president of the United States thinks that he can do this. But there's one thing that I know, and I say this on a Sunday morning, I know there's a king of king and a lord of lords, and I know he does not live in the White House.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about a speech you gave last night. You represented your party at the Gridiron Dinner, an annual gathering of journalists here. And you dedicated your remarks to federal workers. You said there was dignity in the work that they do.",
      "You also spoke about your party, though, and the struggles that it is having. You said Democrats used to be the cool ones. You joked about the advanced age of your party's leaders, saying their staff has to stand around with defibrillators. I know these are jokes, but - but you're acknowledging something here. Is the issue with your party age or a lack of vision? And is the reset underway to fix those things?",
      "GOVERNOR WES MOORE: I think we need to be very clear about who we're fighting for. And I think we need to be very clear about the vision that we are offering.",
      "You know, I think about what's happening, you know, in this moment, even the conversation around the continued resolution, where - where we all know that the consequences of a federal government shutdown would have been disastrous on the state of Maryland. But one thing we did not do was offer an alternative. One thing we did not do was articulate the terms for the American people.",
      "And so I think, when one - when the American people, when they do not have an option or they're not seeing people fighting on their behalf, then, yes, there is going to be a measurement of frustration. We are doing everything in our power to fight for the people. And I think it becomes incredibly important, because people are paying attention who their fighters are and who their fighters are not.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, there were voices within your party on Capitol Hill who offered alternatives, they just weren't listened to. Do you think there's just no leader in the party?",
      "GOVERNOR WES MOORE: I don't - I don't see a difference. I don't - I don't see a difference.",
      "And, frankly, I don't think the American people see a difference. If they are not hearing an alternative, if they're not hearing an alternative plan, if they're not hearing the plan to push back and fight back, if they're not seeing what we are doing in the streets and in the communities and in the neighborhoods to fight for their best interests, I think for the American people they just look at it as theater. And that is the frustrating thing. The performative politics, people are done, and they're exhausted by it. They just want to see results. And that's exactly what we're trying to provide in the state of Maryland.",

      "The HR 8799 system, 130 light years from Earth, is only 30 million years old \u2014 just a baby compared to our solar system's 4.6 billion years. A U.S.-led team of researchers used Webb to directly detect carbon dioxide in the atmosphere of all four of the system's known planets, according to the study.",
      "\"Webb's new images of two iconic systems, HR 8799 and 51 Eridani, and their planets have stunned researchers, and provided additional information into the chemical make-up of the young gas giants,\" NASA said in a statement.",
      "They used Webb's coronagraph instruments, which block the light from bright stars to get a better view of the planets revolving around them.",
      "\"It's like putting your thumb up in front of the sun when you're looking up at the sky,\" lead study author William Balmer, an astrophysicist at Johns Hopkins University, told AFP.",
      "Normally, the Webb telescope only detects exoplanets by glimpsing them when they cross in front of their host star.",
      "This \"transiting method\" was how Webb indirectly detected CO2 in the atmosphere of the gas giant WASP-39 in 2022.",

      "\"Our hope with this kind of research is to understand our own solar system, life, and ourselves in the comparison to other exoplanetary systems, so we can contextualize our existence,\" Balmer said. \"We want to take pictures of other solar systems and see how they're similar or different when compared to ours. From there, we can try to get a sense of how weird our solar system really is\u2014or how normal.\"",
      "Astronomers have now discovered nearly 6,000 exoplanets, many of them massive \u2014 and none of them known to be habitable.",
      "The \"huge leap forward we need to make\" is to focus on smaller Earth-sized worlds, Balmer said.",

    "summary": "Scientists are conducting experiments to generate clean energy through fusion, the same sub-atomic reaction that powers our Sun, with the aim of constructing plants that produce more energy than they consume.",
    "story": [
      "If it looks like the set of some Hollywood sci-fi show, perhaps that's fitting, because what they are doing here is making stars on Earth. \"We are able to make miniature stars, 'cause fusion is the same reaction that powers the Sun and stars,\" said Tammy Ma, who leads the Fusion Energy Initiative at the National Ignition Facility (NIF) in Livermore, California. It's part of the same government laboratory that ensures the safety and reliability of the nation's nuclear stockpile.",
      "\"Every time we do a fusion experiment on the NIF, we are actually the hottest place in the entire solar system, hotter than the center of the Sun,\" Ma said.",
      "The scientists here are using the largest laser ever built. It's 1,000 times more powerful than the entire U.S. electrical grid, and is housed in a massive room the size of a three football fields. Here, 192 laser beams travel nearly a mile, and then focus in on a tiny target, or fuel pellet, smaller than a peppercorn. \u00a0When the lasers hit the pellet, the atoms \"fuse\" together, releasing energy in the process.",
      "That little fuel pellet is only about two millimeters in diameter. But the consequences could be huge.",
      "Fusion is a process that merges atoms together, and releases more energy than fission (which splits atoms apart). Fission is used by today's nuclear power plants and creates hazardous nuclear waste; fusion does not.",
      "Fusion would theoretically provide a nearly-limitless source of clean and safe energy, powering our world without the fossil fuels that are warming the planet and contributing to climate change. It would make energy-intensive technologies like vertical farming and water desalination much cheaper, potentially solving the world's food and water problems. Ma said, \"It is completely clean. There's no carbon anywhere in the equation. There's no high-level nuclear waste. You can place fusion power plants nearly anywhere. It could help meet all of the energy needs for the U.S. now and into the future, even as our energy needs rise.\"",
      "But fusion is hard. After 60 years of research by scientists at NIF, they finally generated a reaction (also called \"ignition\") that produced more energy than it consumed. The breakthrough, in 2022, crucial to ever creating a fusion power plant, made headlines around the world. Humans had unlocked the power of the stars.",

      "Inside the nuclear fusion breakthrough that could be a step to unlimited clean energy in the distant future (\"60 Minutes\")",
      "They have achieved ignition several times since then, and now the race is on to generate enough energy to consistently power a commercial fusion plant.",
      "Bob Mumgaard is CEO and co-founder of Commonwealth Fusion Systems outside of Boston, one of more than two dozen fusion startups getting billions of dollars in funding from the government and investors. \"It's gonna take time, it's gonna take work, but this is the birth of an industry,\" Mumgaard said.",
      "Instead of lasers, Commonwealth uses a cloud of super-heated plasma that burns at around 180 million degrees Fahrenheit, held in place by massive magnets that the company manufactures on site. \"The magnets in this machine will be the strongest magnets in the world,\" Mumgaard said. \"[They] could lift up an aircraft carrier.\"",
      "Commonwealth expects to complete its demonstration reactor next year. It just announced plans to build its first full-scale power plant in Virginia, but that won't deliver energy to the grid until sometime next decade. The demonstration reactor, Mumgaard said, \"is the penultimate step to that.\"",
      "Critics point out that fusion power has been an ever-elusive holy grail, always 20 to 30 years away. But startups like Commonwealth say this time is different. The technology is advancing as fast as the need for clean energy is rising \u2013 stars aligning in the quest to create stars here on Earth.",
      "\"This is not a paper exercise for us,\" Mumgaard said. \"We're putting this machine together, we're buying the parts, we're machining the parts, and it's all coming together at the exact time the world really needs something like this. I think that's a really cool story.\"",

    "summary": "The Alaska Volcano Observatory said signs indicated a Mount Spurr eruption was likely, though not certain, in the weeks or months ahead.",
    "story": [
      "A volcano near Alaska's largest city is showing new signs of unrest, with experts saying the likelihood of an eruption at Mount Spurr in the next few weeks or months has increased.",
      "The Alaska Volcano Observatory said Wednesday\u00a0it had measured during recent overflights \"significantly elevated volcanic gas emissions,\" and said signs indicated an eruption was likely, though not certain, in the weeks or months ahead.",
      "\"We expect to see further increases in seismic activity, gas emissions and surface heating prior to an eruption, if one were to occur,\" the observatory said in a statement. \"Such stronger unrest may provide days to weeks of additional warning.\"",
      "However, the observatory warned that it was possible that an eruption could happen with little or no warning.",
      "\"While we expect additional changes to monitoring data prior to an eruption, it is also possible that an eruption could occur with little or no additional warning,\" the observatory wrote. \"This would be extremely hazardous for recreators on Mount Spurr or near its drainages as well as those overflying the volcano.\"",
      "What is Mount Spurr?",
      "Mount Spurr is one of 53 volcanoes in Alaska that have been active within the last 250 years. It has two main vents and is 11,070 feet (3,374 meters) tall. It is covered in ice and snow and is located roughly 80 miles (129 kilometers) northwest of Anchorage.",
      "When did Mount Spurr last erupt?",
      "The last known eruption from the summit vent was more than 5,000 years ago. The Crater Peak vent, meanwhile, erupted once in 1953 and three times in 1992, according to the observatory. The Crater Peak vent is about 2 miles (3 kilometers) south of the summit.",
      "There have been periods of increased earthquake or other activity since then, including between 2004 and 2006, but no other eruptions. Last October, the observatory raised its alert status for Mount Spurr from green to yellow when an increase in seismic activity became pronounced and a ground deformation was spotted in satellite data.",
      "The most likely outcome of the current unrest would be an eruption or eruptions similar to those in 1953 and 1992, the observatory said.",
      "\"It is also possible that no eruption occurs and the present activity slowly dies away or that a smaller eruption takes place,\" John Power, a geophysicist with the U.S. Geological Survey at the observatory, wrote in an email.",
      "What impacts could an eruption have?",
      "The eruptions during the last century lasted between three and seven hours, produced ash columns that rose more than 50,000 feet (15,240 meters) above sea level and deposited ashfall in south-central Alaska communities, according to the observatory.",
      "In 1992, ashfall of about a quarter-inch in Anchorage prompted residents to stay inside or to wear masks if going outside to avoid breathing ash. The cloud drifted as far as Greenland.",
      "CBS affiliate WGME-TV reported that the ash could drift all the way to the East Coast, but that would depend on the jet stream, and it probably would not have a major impact.",
      "Volcanic ash is angular and sharp and has been used as an industrial abrasive. The powdered rock can cause a jet engine to shut down.",
      "The 1992 eruptions prompted the temporary closures of airports in Anchorage and other communities.",

    "story": [
      "A new report on the state of birds in the United States has an urgent warning: bird populations across nearly every habitat are declining, with about one-third of U.S. bird species in critical need of conservation action.",
      "A total of 229 out of 718 bird species in the U.S. are now classified as high or moderate conservation concerns, according to the 2025 State of the Birds report, which was produced by a consortium of scientific and conservation organizations led by the North American Bird Conservation Initiative. This includes 112 \"tipping point\" species \u2014 those that have lost more than half their populations in the past five decades. Some, like the Allen's hummingbird, tricolored blackbird and saltmarsh sparrow, are at extreme risk without immediate intervention, says the report, released Thursday.",
      "The population of grassland birds in the U.S. has dropped by 43% since 1970, as row-crop production, drought and habitat loss take their toll, the report says. Aridland birds have declined 41% in the same period due to drought, wildfires and invasive species. Even forest birds, facing habitat degradation from fire suppression and industrial timber practices, are seeing widespread declines. Waterfowl, once considered a conservation success, have declined by 20% since 2014 from the loss of wetlands and grasslands.",
      "The findings continue a downward trend. A 2019 study published in Science, an academic journal, found that North America lost nearly 3 billion birds over the previous 50 years, including 90 \"tipping point\" species of 529 bird species that were examined.",
      "\"The 2025 State of the Birds report shows those losses are continuing, with declines among several bird trend indicators,\" the new report says. \"Notably duck populations\u2014a bright spot in past State of the Birds reports, with strong increases since 1970\u2014have trended downward in recent years.\"",
      "Conservationists have previously warned that bird populations are in steep decline due to habitat loss and climate change, and they're further alarmed after the U.S. Interior Department last month suspended a legal opinion from the Biden administration that held companies accountable for accidentally killing birds through industrial activities like oil and gas drilling, wind energy production and construction \u2013 in a victory for the energy sector.",
      "Birds play a critical role in maintaining healthy ecosystems. They help control pests, disperse seeds and pollinate plants, contributing to crop yields and supporting biodiversity, says Amanda Rodewald, faculty director of the Cornell Lab of Ornithology's Center for Avian Population Studies",
      "And declining bird populations signal larger environmental problems, experts say.",
      "\"There's a really long history and a lot of evidence that shows that birds can be excellent indicators of environmental conditions,\" Rodewald told CBS News. \"We share the same environments with birds, if they're not healthy for bird populations, they're not likely to be healthy for us either.\"",
      "Beyond their ecological role, birds bring significant economic and mental health benefits. Birdwatching contributes $279 billion to the U.S. economy and supports 1.4 million jobs, according to the report. Encounters with birds have also been linked to reduced stress and improved mental well-being, further underscoring their importance.",
      "Experts stress that conservation efforts can succeed when adequately funded. The bald eagle, once nearly wiped out by the pesticide DDT, has rebounded thanks to concerted efforts. In December, the species even gained bipartisan recognition as the official U.S. bird.",
      "Strategic habitat conservation efforts \u2014 such as conservation ranching, coastal restoration and seabird translocation \u2014 are already making a difference in some regions.",
      "The new report calls for increased investment in conservation programs, stronger habitat protections, and policies that promote sustainable land management. Without swift action, scientists warn, the next State of the Birds report could bring even graver news.",
      "\"Birds unite us across the hemisphere and across the political spectrum,\" said Marshall Johnson, chief conservation officer at the National Audubon Society. \"There should be no hesitation in moving to protect them today and in the future.\""

    "story": [
      "Researchers in Spain have unearthed a fossil from a potential new prehistoric member of the human family tree, and they say it's the earliest known remnants of a face discovered in Western Europe.",
      "The facial bones from an adult were found at the Atapuerca archaeological site in northern Spain in 2022. Since then, a team of scientists has been working to learn more about the hominin, whom they nicknamed Pink. The researchers shared their findings in a study in the journal\u00a0Nature, which was published on Tuesday.",
      "Pink's remains have been dated as between 1.1 and 1.4 million years old, the researchers said.",
      "The research \"introduces a new actor in the history of human evolution in Europe,\" study author Rosa Huguet, of Spain's University of Rovira i Virgili, said at a news conference, according to the AFP news agency.",
      "The discovery suggests that early humans settled in Europe, traveling from the east side of the continent to the west, about 1.4 million years ago, the researchers said. Until now, the oldest-known human species in Western Europe was the\u00a0Homo antecessor. Experts have found Homo antecessor remains that are around 850,000 years old.",
      "The oldest human ancestor found in any area of Europe is the Dmanisi people, or Homo georgicus, a group that lived in what is now the nation of Georgia. Remains of that species have been dated back to 1.8 million years ago. They are the first members of the human family known to have traveled from Africa to Europe.",
      "The face of \"Pink\"",
      "The fossilized upper jawbone and partial cheekbone were excavated from a 52-foot-deep layer of silt and mud at Sima del Elefante, or the \"elephant pit,\" a site less than 1,000 feet from where the fossils of\u00a0Homo antecessor were discovered in 1994. The bones were not enough for researchers to determine Pink's age or gender.",
      "From those fossilized bones, researchers were able to use 3D imaging techniques to create a model of Pink's face. The face is more \"projected forward and more robust\" than a modern human face or a\u00a0Homo antecessor face, Maria Martinon-Torres, director of Spain's National Research Center on Human Evolution, told the AFP.",
      "Pink's face bears some similarities to the human ancestor Homo erectus,\u00a0researchers said. That species spanned nearly 2 million years and was the first human species to evolve more familiar human body proportions and use fire and tools. Remains of the species have been found in Africa, Asia and Europe.",
      "But the similarities weren't strong enough for the scientists to confirm that Pink was a member of that species. Instead, they have proposed that Pink could belong to a new possible species, which they called Homo 'affinis' erectus.",
      "\"This is the most honest proposal we can make with the evidence we have,\" Martinon-Torres said, according to AFP.",
      "The scientists were also able to analyze small stone tools and animal bones found at the excavation site to learn more about how Pink lived. The environment at the time was a humid forest landscape, and the early human population lived alongside horses, ancient cattle, monkeys and hippos, the researchers said. The area also likely had plenty of water, which would have made it an \"ideal\" place for the species to settle, Huguet said in the news conference.",
      "The researchers suggested that the species may be a bridge between the\u00a0Homo georgicus species and the\u00a0Homo antecessor species. Study co-author Jose Maria Bermudez de Castro told the AFP that it's likely the species \"probably disappeared\" during a severe global cooling era that occurred nearly 900,000 years ago.",

      "\"On behalf of Crew 9, I'd like to say it was a privilege to call the station home, to live and work and be a part of a mission and a team that spans the globe, working together in cooperation for the benefit of humanity,\" Hague radioed as the Crew Dragon drifted away from the station.",
      "\"To our colleagues and dear friends who remain on the station ... we know the station's in great hands. We're excited to see what you guys are going to accomplish.\"",
      "Splashdown off Florida's Gulf Coast south of Tallahassee is expected at 5:57 p.m. EDT.",
      "For Wilmore and Williams, the long overdue trip back to Earth will wrap up a repeatedly extended mission totaling 286 days and 7 hours spanning 4,576 orbits and 121 million miles. They originally expected to spend just eight days or so in orbit.",
      "How will the astronauts return to Earth?",
      "After bidding their station crewmates farewell, Hague and company floated into their Crew Dragon and undocked from the ISS Harmony module's space-facing port at 1:05 a.m. EDT.",
      "Sixteen hours later, the flight plan called for an automated seven-and-a-half-minute de-orbit thruster firing starting at 5:11 p.m. to slow the ship down for re-entry.",
      "After a 27-minute free fall, the spacecraft was expected to plunge back into the discernible atmosphere for the final 12 minutes of the descent, making a parachute-assisted splashdown off the Florida panhandle's Gulf Coast a few minutes before 6 p.m.",
      "A SpaceX recovery ship will be stationed nearby to haul the spacecraft on board so the crew can be helped out of the Crew Dragon's cabin and onto stretchers for initial medical checks.",
      "CBS News will have live coverage of the astronauts' return starting at about 5:50 p.m. EDT. Watch in the video player above or download the free CBS News app for your mobile or streaming device.",
      "Why were the astronauts stuck longer at the ISS?",
      "Wilmore and Williams launched to the International Space Station last June 5 on the first piloted test flight of Boeing's Starliner. The spacecraft suffered multiple propulsion system helium leaks and thruster problems during rendezvous with the space station, and NASA eventually decided to keep them on the station and to bring the Starliner down, without its crew, by remote control.",
      "NASA launched the next crew rotation mission \u2014 Crew 9 \u2014 in September carrying just two crew members, Hague and Gorbunov, instead of four. Wilmore and Williams then joined the Crew 9 fliers aboard the ISS for a normal-duration six-month mission.",
      "By keeping them in space as part of Crew 9, NASA was able to minimize the disruption to the ISS crew rotation sequence while maintaining a full slate of experiments and research.",
      "NASA cleared the way for Crew 9's return to Earth by launching four replacements \u2014 Crew 10 commander Anne McClain, pilot Nichole Ayers, cosmonaut Kirill Peskov and Japanese astronaut Takuya Onishi \u2014 last Friday.",
      "Normal practice calls for a five-day \"handover\" between crews so the new arrivals can be fully briefed on the ins and outs of station operations and maintenance. But in this case, handover was shortened to just one day to take advantage of predicted favorable splashdown weather in the Gulf.",
      "All station astronauts spend two hours a day exercising to minimize bone and muscle loss in the weightlessness of space. Even so, Wilmore and Williams will face extensive rehabilitation over the next several weeks and months as their bodies re-adapt to the unfamiliar tug of gravity.",
      "Hague and Gorbunov, who spent spent 171 days in space, will re-adapt more quickly, perhaps, but both will require physical therapy.",
      "Was this the longest any U.S. astronaut has stayed in space?",
      "While 286 days is a long flight by normal NASA standards, it's well short of the U.S. record for a single flight \u2014 371 days, set by astronaut Frank Rubio in 2022-23.",
      "Ironically, Rubio's record was the result of another extended mission, this one the result of a major coolant leak in the Russian Soyuz he launched aboard. The Russians decided not to bring the crew down aboard their original spacecraft and instead launched a replacement.",
      "As a result, Rubio ended up spending a little more than a full year in space, twice as long as he originally expected.",
      "Given Williams' two previous stays aboard the space station, she will move up to No. 2 on the list of most experienced U.S. astronauts with 608 days in space overall. Only former astronaut Peggy Whitson has more time aloft, 675 days over four flights. Wilmore's total across three flights will stand at 464 days aloft.",

      "The James Webb Space Telescope has directly observed the key chemical of carbon dioxide in planets outside of our solar system for the first time, scientists announced Monday.",
      "The gas giants are not capable of hosting extraterrestrial life, but do offer clues in a lingering mystery about how distant planets form, according to a study in The Astrophysical Journal.",
      "The HR 8799 system, 130 light years from Earth, is only 30 million years old \u2014 just a baby compared to our solar system's 4.6 billion years. A U.S.-led team of researchers used Webb to directly detect carbon dioxide in the atmosphere of all four of the system's known planets, according to the study.",
      "\"Webb's new images of two iconic systems, HR 8799 and 51 Eridani, and their planets have stunned researchers, and provided additional information into the chemical make-up of the young gas giants,\" NASA said in a statement.",
      "They used Webb's coronagraph instruments, which block the light from bright stars to get a better view of the planets revolving around them.",
      "\"It's like putting your thumb up in front of the sun when you're looking up at the sky,\" lead study author William Balmer, an astrophysicist at Johns Hopkins University, told AFP.",
      "Normally, the Webb telescope only detects exoplanets by glimpsing them when they cross in front of their host star.",
      "This \"transiting method\" was how Webb indirectly detected CO2 in the atmosphere of the gas giant WASP-39 in 2022.",
      "But for this latest discovery, \"we're actually seeing the light that is emitted from the planet itself, as opposed to the fingerprint of that light from the host star,\" Balmer said.",
      "This is not easy \u2014 Balmer compared the process to using a torch to spot fireflies next to a lighthouse.",
      "While these gas giants may not be able to host life, it is possible that they had moons that could, he added.",
      "There are missions currently under way to find out if there could be life in the vast oceans underneath the icy shells of several of Jupiter's moons.",
      "\"Key piece of proof\"",
      "Carbon dioxide (CO2) is essential for life on Earth, making it a key target in the search for life elsewhere.",
      "Because CO2 condenses into little ice particles in the deep cold of space, its presence can shed light on planetary formation.",
      "Jupiter and Saturn are believed to have first formed from a \"bottom up\" process in which a bunch of tiny, icy particles came together into a solid core which then sucked in gas to grow into giants, Balmer said.",
      "So the new discovery is a \"key piece of proof\" that far-off planets can form in a similar way to those in our celestial backyard, Balmer said.",
      "But how common this is throughout the universe remains unclear.",
      "\"Our hope with this kind of research is to understand our own solar system, life, and ourselves in the comparison to other exoplanetary systems, so we can contextualize our existence,\" Balmer said. \"We want to take pictures of other solar systems and see how they're similar or different when compared to ours. From there, we can try to get a sense of how weird our solar system really is\u2014or how normal.\"",
      "Astronomers have now discovered nearly 6,000 exoplanets, many of them massive \u2014 and none of them known to be habitable.",
      "The \"huge leap forward we need to make\" is to focus on smaller Earth-sized worlds, Balmer said.",
      "NASA's Nancy Grace Roman space telescope will use a coronagraph to do that just after its planned launch in 2027.",
      "Last year, the Webb telescope discovered carbon dioxide and hydrogen peroxide on the surface of Charon, Pluto's largest moon.",
      "Balmer hopes to use Webb to observe more four-planet systems, but added that future funding was now in question.",
      "Last week the Trump administration announced that NASA's chief scientist has been dismissed, indicating that more cuts were to come for the U.S. space agency.",

From there, it glided straight in for docking at the Harmony module's forward port at 12:04 a.m. EDT.",
      "Motorized latches then engaged to pull the capsule into the docking mechanism for an airtight structural seal. After standard leak checks and umbilical connections, the crew opened the Dragon's forward hatch at 1:35 a.m. and floated into the space station.",
      "Crew 10 commander Anne McClain, an Army colonel and former combat helicopter pilot, told flight controllers she and her fellow fliers had a \"great trip\" from the launch pad to the space station, adding \"I cannot tell you the immense joy of our crew when we looked out the window and we saw the space station for the first time.\"",
      "\"Let me tell you, that is such an amazing journey, you can hardly even put it into words,\" she said. \"The ride up on the Falcon 9, orbiting the Earth for the last couple of days, it's been absolutely incredible ... Thank you very, very much.\"",

By that point, Wilmore and Williams will have logged about 290 days \u2014 9.7 months \u2014 in space on a flight originally expected to last a little longer than one week. Hague and Gorbunov's time in space will come to around 174 days, depending on the landing date.",
      "\"This is a huge mission for us on Crew 10,\" said Steve Stich, manager of the commercial crew program that oversees SpaceX Crew Dragons and Boeing's Starliner. \"They're all big, but this started all the way back to Crew 9 when we launched that mission with two empty seats, and we had those seats reserved for Butch and Suni.\"",
      "The Starliner astronauts have \"just done a phenomenal job,\" Stich said, \"and so we're excited to bring them back.\"",
      "Wilmore and Williams were launched aboard a Boeing Starliner capsule on June 5 for the spacecraft's first piloted test flight. They successfully docked with the International Space Station the next day, but the Starliner experienced multiple helium propulsion system leaks and several maneuvering jets did not produce the expected thrust.",
      "The astronauts originally planned to spend about eight days in space, but NASA and Boeing, the Starliner's builder, carried out weeks of tests and analysis to determine whether the Starliner could be trusted to safely bring its crew back to Earth.",

Instead, they decided to keep the astronauts aboard the station until early this year when they could hitch a ride back aboard the Crew 9 Dragon.",
      "The Starliner, meanwhile, successfully returned to Earth in September, kicking off hands-on troubleshooting and ongoing work to prepare for the eventual resumption of flights.",

      "\"Butch, and I knew this was a test flight, we knew that we would probably find some things (that did not work as expected), and we found some stuff,\" Williams told CBS News in an in-flight interview. \"And so that was not a surprise. The discussion went over the summer, and as things started unrolling, unraveling, we sort of understood that, hey, we might be up here a little bit longer.",
      "\"And that's what our job is. We have both been in the military, both Navy guys, our deployments have been extended. You do what's right for the team, and what was right for the team is to stay up here and be expedition crew members for the International Space Station.\"",
      "President Trump blamed the extended mission on the Biden administration, which he said had \"abandoned\" the Starliner crew.",
      "\"Biden left them up there,\" Trump told reporters from the Oval Office on March 6. \"We have two astronauts that are stuck in space. I have asked Elon (Musk), I said, 'Do me a favor, can you get 'em out?' He said 'Yes.' He is preparing to go up I think in two weeks.\"",
      "But the Crew Dragon that Mr. Trump was referring to will not be bringing Wilmore and Williams back to Earth. It it is assigned to the Crew 10 fliers and will remain docked at the outpost for the next five months. Their arrival does, however, clear the way for Crew 9, including Wilmore and Williams, to finally return to Earth along with Hague and Gorbunov.",
      "Musk said earlier he offered to launch a mission to bring Wilmore and Williams back to Earth earlier, but the offer, he said, was turned down for political reasons. NASA managers say they never heard of such an offer and that the current plan causes the least disruption to station operations and downstream crew rotation flights.",
      "While NASA could have brought Crew 9 down earlier aboard the Crew 9 Dragon, but that would have left a single astronaut \u2014 Pettit \u2014 aboard the lab to operate and maintain the U.S. segment of the space station. Research would have ground to a halt and he would have had difficulty in a variety of emergency scenarios.",
      "\"Sure, it could have taken us home, but that leaves only three people on the space station from the Soyuz crew, two Russians and one American,\" Williams told CBS News. \"And, you know, the space station is big. It's a building, you know, it's the size of a football field. Things happen.",
      "\"So things can go wrong, and you need to be able to fix it, either inside and outside. And so having additional people to be able to do that is really important.\"",
      "Both Wilmore and Williams have repeatedly said they are not \"stranded\" and have not been \"abandoned\" in space.",
      "\"That's been the narrative from day one, stranded, abandoned, stuck, and I get it, we both get it,\" Wilmore told a reporter during a recent interview. \"But that is, again, not what our human space flight program is about. We don't feel abandoned, we don't feel stuck, we don't feel stranded.",
      "\"We come prepared. We come committed. That is what your human space flight program is. It prepares for any and all contingencies that we can conceive of, and we prepare for those ... Let's change (the narrative) to 'prepared' and 'committed.'\"",

      "Those who glanced up at the sky Thursday night had an opportunity to catch the March 2025 \"Blood Moon,\" a phenomenon that colors the full moon in shades of red, orange and yellow during a total lunar eclipse.",
      "This month's full moon\u00a0was due to pass through the shadow of Earth either late Thursday night or very early Friday morning, depending on the viewer's time zone. It was visible to people in the Americas and elsewhere in the Western Hemisphere.",
      "Dubbed the \"Worm Moon\" by the Farmer's Almanac, which has been assigning names to full moons for almost a century, this one is expected to last through Saturday morning, according to NASA. The full moon technically rose in its totality early Friday.",
      "Here's what to know about the event \u2014 and why the moon showed a new hue when it happened.",
      "Why was the moon red, orange and yellow?",
      "The moon appeared to turn red as Earth passed directly between it and the sun in what's known as a total lunar eclipse. Their perfect alignment darkens the moon, from the perspective of folks looking up, because our planet's position blocks most sunlight from reaching it.",
      "Some light still makes its way to the moon's surface, but only certain shades of it. The colors that wind up there are longer wavelengths of light \u2014 red, orange, yellow \u2014 which withstood the journey through \"a thick slice of Earth's atmosphere,\" NASA said.",
      "Shorter wavelengths of the color spectrum, like blue, scatter easily when they hit the atmosphere. That's why a vast sky can look blue in the middle of the day, when sunlight can shine straight down from overhead. Longer wavelengths materialize on Earth when sunlight hits from more of a perpendicular angle, so its route through our atmosphere can be more extensive. Short wavelengths are essentially filtered out by the atmosphere over such a protracted distance, and only the longer reds, oranges and yellows remain.",
      "What is a \"Blood Moon\"?",
      "\"Blood Moon\" is a nickname that refers to the moon's reddish appearance during a total lunar eclipse.",
      "The full moon takes on several shades of red, orange and yellow when it's nearer the outer edges of Earth's shadow \u2014 when it first intersects with the path of Earth's shadow, for example, and as it's on its way out. But shades of deep red become more pronounced as the moon enters the darkest part of the shadow.",
      "What exactly causes a \"Blood Moon\"?",
      "A \"Blood Moon\" happens during a total lunar eclipse, when the sun, Earth and the moon align in that order. Long wavelengths of sunlight are refracted through Earth's atmosphere before reaching the moon, which reflects them in reddish hues that may resemble the color of blood.",
      "When was the \"Blood Moon\" lunar eclipse?",
      "This week's \"Blood Moon\" began late Thursday night. The moon moved through Earth's shadow overnight, with the best opportunity to see the reddish moon around 3 a.m. ET Friday.",

    "story": [
      "Astronomy fans are in for a treat this March as the full moon will appear to turn red during a total lunar eclipse.",
      "March's full moon, known as the Worm Moon, will pass into Earth's shadow on the night of March 13, or early on March 14, depending on the time zone, according to NASA. This eclipse will be visible from Earth's Western Hemisphere.",
      "The Old Farmer's Almanac details specific moonrise times for ZIP codes across the U.S. Local forecasts also include detailed information on how clear the night sky will be in various locations.",
      "What is a lunar eclipse?",
      "A lunar eclipse happens when the sun, Earth and moon all align so that the moon passes into the Earth's shadow. During a total lunar eclipse, like the one happening this March, the entire moon will fall within the darkest part of Earth's shadow.",
      "Each lunar eclipse is visible from half of Earth.",
      "There are also partial and penumbral eclipses, which are when the sun, Earth and moon are not perfectly aligned.",
      "Why does the moon look red during the lunar eclipse?",
      "With the moon in the shadow of the Earth, it will appear red-orange, according to NASA. Lunar eclipses are sometimes called blood moons because of the phenomenon.",
      "During a lunar eclipse, the moon gets its red coloration because any sunlight that's not blocked by the Earth is filtered through a \"thick slice of Earth's atmosphere\" as it heads toward the moon's surface, according to NASA. The more dust or clouds in Earth's atmosphere during the total lunar eclipse, the redder the moon will appear.",
      "\"It's as if all the world's sunrises and sunsets are projected onto the Moon,\" NASA explains in a blog post.",
      "This is the same phenomenon that makes the sky appear blue during the day.",
      "Why is March's full moon called the worm moon?",
      "The Worm Moon nickname may have come from the earthworms typically found as spring nears, according to the\u00a0Old Farmer's Almanac. Other research suggests the name may date back to writings from the 1760s about worms, or beetle larvae, coming out from bark as trees thaw from the winter.",
      "There are also other names for March's full moon related to the transition from winter to spring. The first day of spring will be on March 20, just days after the Worm Moon.",
      "Other names for March's full moon are the Eagle Moon, Goose Moon, Crow Comes Back Moon, Sugar Moon, Wind Strong Moon and Sore Eyes Moon.",
      "What else can you see during the full Blood Worm Moon?",
      "If there's a bit of rain during the full moon, there may be a rare moonbow, according to the Old Farmer's Almanac. It's like a rainbow, but created by moonlight, rather than sunlight. Moonbows only happen when the full Moon is fairly low in the sky, so the phenomenon would be most apparent in the hours after sunset when the sky is dark.",
      "Viewers can also look to the western sky on the night of the total lunar eclipse to catch a glimpse of Jupiter and Mars, according to NASA. Constellations may also be easier to spot than usual as Earth's shadow dims the Moon's glow.",

    "summary": "A space probe named Hera captured images of Mars' small Deimos moon while on a mission to examine an asteroid.",
    "story": [
      "A space probe flying past Mars captured images of the red planet's small, mysterious moon.",
      "The space probe, named Hera, was launched on Oct. 7, 2024, and is on a mission to gather close-up data about the Dimorphos asteroid, the European Space Agency said in a news release. The asteroid was the first to have its orbit altered by human action, when it was impacted by NASA's DART spacecraft in 2022. The goal of Hera is to learn more about asteroid deflection so the technique can be refined and used again.",
      "While on a flyby of Mars, Hera was able to use three of its imaging instruments to capture images of Deimos, the smaller of Mars' two moons, the ESA said. Deimos is about 15,000 miles from Mars. Scientists have previously speculated that it may actually be a piece of asteroid, not a moon.",
      "Hera got as close as 1,000 kilometers, or about 620 miles, to Deimos. It used its various instruments to capture the images, characterize the mineral makeup on the moon and chart surface temperatures. These features combined will help scientists learn more about the lunar body, the ESA said.",
      "\"These instruments have been tried out before, during Hera's departure from Earth, but this is the first time that we have employed them on a small distant moon for which we still lack knowledge \u2013 demonstrating their excellent performance in the process,\" ESA Hera mission scientist Michael Kueppers said in the news release.",
      "The ESA's Mars Express, which has been orbiting the red planet for over 20 years, also contributed observations of the moon. Results from the encounter should help guide operational planning for a mission set to explore Martian moons in 2026, the ESA said. That mission, in conjunction with NASA and French and German space agencies, will collect detailed measurements of Mars' two moons and land on Phobos, the larger lunar body, to collect a sample that can be returned to Earth for analysis.",
      "Hera also used the flyby of Mars to adjust its trajectory through deep space. That maneuver shortened Hera's travel time to Dimorphos, the ESA said. Hera will also collect information about Didymos, the asteroid that Dimorphos orbits around. Hera is expected to reach the Didymos in December 2026, the ESA said.",
      "\"This has been the Hera team's first exciting experience of exploration, but not our last,\" said Hera mission manager Ian Carnelli in the news release. \"In 21 months the spacecraft will reach our target asteroids, and start our crash site investigation of the only object in our Solar System to have had its orbit measurably altered by human action.\"",

    "published": "Thu, 13 Mar 2025 04:55:51 -0400",
    "summary": "NASA will wait at least another two days to launch its next space station crew, delaying the return of Starliner astronauts Barry \"Butch\" Wilmore and Sunita Williams a bit longer.",
    "story": [
      "With the countdown within 45 minutes of launch, NASA called off an attempt to send the next crew to the International Space Station Thursday evening to allow more time to troubleshoot a ground system hydraulics issue. If the problem can be resolved in time, NASA and SpaceX will make another attempt to launch the crew Friday evening.",
      "The scrub will add at least two more days to the eventual return to Earth of Starliner commander Barry \"Butch\" Wilmore and pilot Sunita Williams, along with two other outgoing space station crew members.",
      "Crew-10 commander Anne McClain, pilot Nichole Ayers, Japanese astronaut Takuya Onishi and Russian cosmonaut Kirill Peskov were strapped in and ready for blastoff from historic pad 39 at the Kennedy Space Center at 7:48 p.m. EDT Wednesday.",
      "But throughout the final few hours of the countdown, SpaceX engineers were troubleshooting an apparent problem with one of two clamp arms that hold the Falcon 9 rocket to its launch support gantry. Hydraulics are used to retract the two clamps prior to launch, and while the system appeared to be working normally, it wasn't clear whether one of the arms would retract fully.",
      "A launch opportunity Thursday was ruled out due to expected high winds and to give engineers more time to assess data and determine what, if any, repairs are needed. If the hydraulics problem can be resolved in time, NASA and SpaceX could be ready to press ahead with a launch attempt at 7:03 p.m. Friday.",
      "Whenever Crew-10 takes off, rendezvous and docking with the space station is expected the following day.",
      "Standing by to welcome them aboard will be Crew-9 commander Nick Hague, cosmonaut Alexander Gorbunov, Wilmore and Williams, along with cosmonauts Alexsey Ovchinin, Ivan Vagner and NASA astronaut Don Pettit, who were launched last September aboard a Russian Soyuz spacecraft.",
      "McClain and her crewmates will spend two days getting briefed by Crew-9 on the intricacies of space station operations before Hague, Gorbunov, Wilmore and Williams undock on March 19\u00a0for their return to Earth. The normal \"handover\" period is five days or so, but mission managers shortened it this time around to maintain the lab's food reserves.",
      "While the ongoing saga of the \"stranded\" Starliner astronauts has overshadowed the Crew-10 mission, McClain said she and her crewmates began training for their mission in 2023 and they were all eager to finally get into space. McClain and Onishi are space station veterans while Ayers and Peskov are making their first flight.",
      "All four are veteran military or commercial pilots. Before joining NASA, McClain, an active-duty Army colonel, served as a combat helicopter pilot while Ayers, an Air Force major, is a veteran F-22 Raptor pilot. Onishi served as a commercial pilot in Japan, flying Boeing 767 jetliners, and Peskov is an experienced commercial 757 pilot.",
      "\"We're going to have planned and unplanned maintenance to keep the space station running,\" McClain said. \"We have a plethora of science experiments, both inside and outside of the space station. We have spacewalks. We have visiting vehicles (and) the potential of (hosting) private astronaut missions.\"",
      "\"They're ready to come home\"",
      "As for Wilmore and Williams, McClain said, \"honestly, I'm kind of most looking forward to breaking bread with those guys, talking to them, giving them big hugs. We go way back. ... We're ready to go up there. They're ready to come home.\"",
      "\"This is a huge mission for us on Crew 10,\" said Steve Stich, manager of the commercial crew program that oversees SpaceX Crew Dragons and Boeing's Starliner. \"They're all big, but this started all the way back to Crew 9 when we launched that mission with two empty seats, and we had those seats reserved for Butch and Suni.\"",
      "The Starliner astronauts have \"just done a phenomenal job,\" Stich said, \"and so we're excited to bring them back.\"",
      "Given an on-time launch for Crew 10 Friday, Hague, Gorbunov, Wilmore and Williams could undock on March 19 and land as early as March 20 or 21. If so, the Starliner astronauts will have logged 288 days or so \u2014  9.5 months \u2014  \u00a0in space on a flight originally expected to last a little longer than one week. Hague and Gorbunov's time in space will come to about 173 days.",
      "The U.S. record for longest single spaceflight is held by astronaut Frank Rubio, who spent 371 days in space because of problems with the Soyuz spacecraft that carried him to orbit. Like the Starliner crew, he was forced to extend his mission and come home on a different Soyuz.",
      "In any case, what would normally be a relatively routine crew rotation, sending up four crew members to replace four others wrapping up a five- to six-month station visit, has turned into political theater, fueled by repeated criticism from President Trump and Elon Musk blaming the Biden administration for the Starliner crew's predicament.",
      "Musk said in a post on his social media platform X that he offered to \"go get\" Wilmore and Williams earlier, but the offer was turned down. He did not say who turned the proposal down or even whether it was someone at NASA or the White House.",
      "\"Biden left them up there,\" Mr. Trump told reporters from the Oval Office on March 6. \"We have two astronauts that are stuck in space. I have asked Elon, I said, do me a favor, can you get 'em out? He said yes. He is preparing to go up I think in two weeks.\"",
      "But the Crew Dragon he was referring to will not be bringing Wilmore and Williams back to Earth. It will be carrying the Crew-10 fliers and will remain docked at the outpost for the next five months. Their arrival does, however, clear the way for Crew-9, including Wilmore and Williams, to finally return to Earth aboard their own Crew Dragon.",
      "That Crew Dragon, which carried Hague and Gorbunov to the station last September for a normal tour of duty, has been docked at the lab ever since. It was launched with two empty seats for Wilmore and Williams so their ride home has been at the station for the past five-and-a-half months.",
      "NASA could have brought Crew-9 down earlier, but that would have left a single astronaut, Pettit, aboard the lab to operate and maintain the U.S. segment of the space station. Research would have ground to a halt and he would have had difficulty in a variety of emergency scenarios.",
      "\"Sure, it could have taken us home, but that leaves only three people on the space station from the Soyuz crew, two Russians and one American,\" Williams told CBS News in an in-flight interview. \"And, you know, the space station is big. It's a building, you know, it's the size of a football field. Things happen.",
      "\"So things can go wrong, and you need to be able to fix it, either inside and outside. And so having additional people to be able to do that is really important.\"",
      "\"We don't feel stranded\"",
      "Both Wilmore and Williams have repeatedly said they are not \"stranded\" and have not been \"abandoned\" in space.",
      "\"That's been the narrative from day one, stranded, abandoned, stuck, and I get it, we both get it,\" Wilmore told a reporter during a recent interview. \"But that is, again, not what our human space flight program is about. We don't feel abandoned, we don't feel stuck, we don't feel stranded.",
      "\"We come prepared. We come committed. That is what your human space flight program is. It prepares for any and all contingencies that we can conceive of, and we prepare for those. ... Let's change (the narrative) to 'prepared' and 'committed.'\"",
      "And so, NASA's plan to bring the Starliner astronauts home, a plan managers said minimized disruption to the space station crew rotation schedule, has been in place since last August. Even so, the president has repeatedly blamed the Biden administration for the extended mission.",
      "NASA managers have not openly challenged the president's comments and have generally downplayed their responses to questions about Musk's claim to have offered to launch another Crew Dragon to bring Wilmore and Williams home.",
      "Last August, Stich was asked about the possibility of launching a mission specifically to bring the Starliner crew back to Earth. He told reporters during a news conference that the agency \"really never considered that option.\"",
      "\"From the very beginning, we liked the option of modifying Crew-9 or Crew-8,\" he said, referring to the option of adding Williams and Wilmore to Hague's crew or whether to shoehorn them into a Crew Dragon that brought four other station fliers back to Earth last October.",
      "\"We looked at both of those and bringing them back on either one of those vehicles,\" Stich said at the time. \"We're trying to lay out the rest of our manifest to make sure we have vehicles available for all the flights. It just didn't make sense to go ahead and accelerate a flight to return Butch and Suni earlier.\"",
      "What went wrong with Boeing's Starliner?",
      "Wilmore and Williams were launched aboard a Boeing Starliner capsule last June 5 for the spacecraft's first piloted test flight. They successfully docked with the International Space Station the next day, but the Starliner experienced multiple helium propulsion system leaks and several maneuvering jets that did not produce the expected thrust.",
      "NASA carried out weeks of tests and analysis to determine whether the Starliner could be trusted to safely bring its crew back to Earth.",
      "By August, Boeing managers were convinced engineers understood the problems and the crew could safely come home in the Starliner. But NASA managers disagreed and ruled that option out. Instead, as Stich described, they decided to keep the astronauts aboard the station until early this year\u00a0when they could hitch a ride back aboard the Crew-9 Dragon.",
      "The Starliner astronauts took the news of a lengthy mission extension in stride.",
      "\"Butch, and I knew this was a test flight, we knew that we would probably find some things (that did not work as expected), and we found some stuff,\" Williams told CBS News. \"And so that was not a surprise. The discussion went over the summer, and as things started unrolling, unraveling, we sort of understood that, hey, we might be up here a little bit longer.",
      "\"And that's what our job is. We have both been in the military, both Navy guys, our deployments have been extended. You do what's right for the team, and what was right for the team is to stay up here and be expedition crew members for the International Space Station.\"",
      "Last September, Boeing successfully brought the Starliner down by remote control and NASA launched the Crew-9 mission aboard a Crew Dragon carrying just two crew members, Hague and Gorbunov, along with two empty seats for Wilmore and Williams.",
      "The Starliner astronauts joined the Crew-9 expedition and originally expected to return to Earth in February after arrival of the next Crew Dragon in the crew rotation sequence. But the Crew-10 Dragon, a new vehicle making its first flight, ran into problems that delayed launch, and Crew-9's return, to the end of March.",
      "NASA eventually decided to switch Crew-10 to a different Dragon, enabling a launch on March 12, a few weeks earlier than the previous late March target. Stich said the capsule swap and slightly earlier launch date were not the result of any outside pressure.",
      "The decision \"really was driven by a lot of other factors,\" Stich said. \"We were looking at this before some of those statements were made by the President and Mr. Musk.\"",
      "Said Ken Bowersox, NASA's chief of spaceflight operations at agency Headquarters: \"I can verify that Steve had been talking about how we might need to juggle the flights and switch capsules a good month before there was any discussion outside of NASA.\"",
      "\"But the president's interest sure added energy to the conversation, and it's great to have a president who's interested in what we're doing.\"",

      "\"Whether it's families looking to escape the final throes of winter or a college student seeking a brief respite from the rigors of academic life, know that the risks are there,\" FBI Assistant Director in Charge Akil Davis said in a news release\u00a0Monday. \"Maintain vigilance throughout your travels and be prepared to contact the nearest U.S. Embassy or Consulate should the need arise.\"",

      "The FBI recommends that travelers \"be vigilant of their surroundings and use caution\" while traveling. Their advice includes establishing points of contact for family members to reference in case of an emergency, using only authorized taxis or shuttles, and being on the lookout for suspicious activity, including someone following you or \"new acquaintances who probe for information about you or who attempt to get you involved in what could become a compromising situation.\"",

A country may have multiple advisories, if certain regions are known to be more of a risk than others.",
      "In Level 1 countries, travelers should exercise normal precautions and be aware that all international travel includes some level of risk. Level 2 recommends increased caution due to \"heightened risks to safety and security.\" Level 3 suggests Americans reconsider travel to that destination, and Level 4 advises against any travel to that location.",

    "story": [
      "Search efforts pressed on into their second week for Sudiksha Konanki, a college student at the University of Pittsburgh who went missing earlier this month during a trip to the Dominican Republic resort town Punta Cana.",
      "Details surrounding Konanki's disappearance have begun to emerge as the international investigation continues. Here's what we know so far about her case.",
      "Konanki seen on video walking to beach",
      "Konanki, 20, is from Chantilly, Virginia, a Washington, D.C., suburb, and attends college in Pittsburgh. She has permanent residency in the United States as well as citizenship in India. She arrived in the Dominican Republic for spring break on March 3 and was vacationing with a group of friends, five other women, according to investigators and her parents.",
      "She\u00a0has been missing\u00a0since Thursday, March 6, after surveillance video showed her, three of her friends and two other American men walk toward the beach area outside the Riu Rep\u00fablica hotel. The video was from around 4:15 a.m., investigators in the Dominican Republic said.",
      "Power outages at the hotel may have prompted guests to move outdoors around that time, the hotel said in a statement. An earlier surveillance video showed Konanki and one of her friends hugging at the hotel bar.",
      "One of the men in the group walking to the beach has been identified as 22-year-old Joshua Riibe, an American college student. In the footage, Konanki and Riibe are seen walking with their arms around each other.",
      "Video shows the other four individuals later returning to the hotel, but Konanki and Riibe stayed behind on the beach, a police source said. The last sighting of Konanki and Riibe in the water happened around 4:50 a.m., according to Loudon County Sheriff Mike Chapman, whose office in Virginia is involved in the investigation.",
      "Riibe told police he and Konanki were swept into the ocean by a large wave and both struggled against rough seas. He said he believed Konanki got out of the water but was not certain, according to a person with direct knowledge of Riibe's statements to U.S. investigators.",
      "He is presumed to be the last person who saw Konanki alive.",
      "Konanki's disappearance is so far being investigated as a missing persons case, not a criminal investigation.",
      "The Dominican Republic's attorney general said investigators were exploring whether Konanki drowned, but not ruling out the possibility of foul play.",
      "Chapman said \"it's hard to say\" whether there are indications Konanki's disappearance was anything other than an accident.",
      "\"We know that at about 4:50 a.m. was the last sighting that we had of them in the water. We don't know what happened after that,\" Chapman said in a \"CBS Mornings\" interview. \"And we also don't know what happened between the time that [Riibe] claimed to have come out of the water and the time that he actually left the beach, so it's really hard to say. It'd be speculative on my part to assume or presume anything at this point.\"",
      "Konanki's family seeking closure",
      "The Loudoun County Sheriff's Office told CBS News that Konanki's family has requested that she be declared deceased, expressed gratitude to investigators for their work, and expressed a desire for closure following her disappearance in the Dominican Republic.",
      "The family provided the request in writing to the sheriff's office, according to spokesperson Thomas Julia. Julia said the family made a similar request to Dominican authorities.",
      "Konanki's family did not immediately respond to a request for comment. CBS News has learned that their written request referenced Riibe's cooperation with investigators and a lack of evidence collected to date that would suggest foul play was involved in Konanki's disappearance.",
      "Chapman said the family has expressed their belief that she drowned.",
      "\"While a final decision to make such a declaration rests with authorities in the Dominican Republic, we will support the Konanki family in every way possible as we continue to review the evidence and information made available to us in the course of this investigation,\" he said.",
      "Riibe faces questioning, says he is cooperating",
      "Riibe has been in Punta Cana for questioning since the investigation got underway.",
      "Authorities confiscated Riibe's passport and he has been confined to a hotel with police escorts anywhere he goes, according to the law firm representing him, Guzm\u00e1n Ariza. Yeni Berenice Reynoso, the Dominican attorney general, was interrogating Riibe directly, attorneys with Guzm\u00e1n Ariza said. A hearing for Riibe's release was set to take place Tuesday, after his attorneys pushed in legal documents for his freedom given the absence of any criminal charge.",
      "Riibe and his parents, Tina and Albert Riibe, extended \"deep sorrow and solidarity\" with Konanski's family in a statement released through his attorney.",
      "\"Above all, we wish to contribute to the search efforts and understand the anguish and uncertainty they are going through and we share the hope that Sudiksha will be found as soon as possible,\" the statement said. \"Joshua Riibe is deeply dismayed by her disappearance and has fully cooperated in the search and clarification of the facts from the very beginning.\"",
      "Chapman told \"CBS Mornings\" that Riibe was \"very forthcoming\" with sheriff's detectives who traveled to the Dominican Republic to speak to him, and did not \"seem to hesitate on answering any of the questions that we threw his way.\"",
      "Chapman noted there was \"nothing that would really make us feel as though there was anything untrue coming from Joshua.\"",
      "Originally from Iowa, Riibe is a college senior at St. Cloud State University in Minnesota, where he is pursuing a degree in land surveying.",
      "His family in their statement described him as \"a beloved son, brother, and friend, known for his kind nature, sense of humor, and commitment to his community.\"",
      "They also shared concerns about the \"irregular conditions\" of his detainment in Punta Cana, where, they said, he had been \"subjected to extensive questioning without the presence of official translators or legal counsel until Wednesday, March 12.\" The family retained a lawyer \"to initiate legal actions ensuring his safety and the protection of his rights throughout this process,\" according to the statement.",
      "Intensifying search efforts",
      "More than 300 police and other officials, with support from the FBI, are searching the air, sea and land to locate her, Dominican President Luis Abinader said. The Dominican Republic National Police said they have assembled a new \"high-level commission\" to oversee the case, and Interpol has\u00a0issued a global police alert at the request of investigators.",
      "\"We are concerned,\" Abinader said at a news conference on March 10. \"All government agencies are searching \u2026 because the latest information we have from one of them, from the last person who was with the young woman, what he says according to the reports is that a wave, while on the beach, crashed into them.\"",
      "Dominican Republic National Police said in a statement March 11 that they were \"re-interviewing targeted individuals who were in the victim's proximity at the time of her disappearance.\" Investigators said the individuals included \"hotel employees where Konanki and her companions were staying, with the goal of gathering information to corroborate her movements, interactions, and any relevant details for the investigation.\"",

      "Investors are bailing out of U.S. stocks \u2014 big time.",
      "A new survey from Bank of America shows that global fund managers are moving out of domestic companies in what analysts at the financial giant describe as the \"biggest drop in U.S. equity allocation ever.\" The reason: growing pessimism about the country's economic outlook as the Trump administration beats the drum for a trade war with Canada, Mexico, China and other countries.",
      "\"Peak U.S. exceptionalism is reflected in record rotation out of U.S. stocks,\" the analysts wrote in a report. Instead, investors with a dimming view of U.S. stocks are increasingly going to cash,\u00a0buying gold and investing in other parts of the world, including the Eurozone, BofA found.",
      "After a two-day rebound, leading market indexes stumbled out of the gate on Tuesday. In morning trade, the S&P 500 fell 53 points, or 0.9%, to 5,622; the Dow Jones Industrial Average sank 236 points, or 0.6%, and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 289 points, or 1.6%.",
      "A major shadow over financial markets is the prospect of steep new U.S. tariffs on key trading partners scheduled to take effect on April 2. Those include 25% duties on U.S. imports from Mexico and Canada, as well as even more sweeping matching levies on a number of other countries.",
      "\"The size, speed and breadth of U.S. tariff hike announcements since January is staggering,\" Brian Coulton, chief economist with Fitch Ratings, said in an email.",
      "The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development on Monday downgraded its forecast for U.S. and global growth, citing the risk of escalating trade disputes.",
      "A stark reality is setting in for investors, according to analysts. President Trump's aggressive rhetoric on trade isn't simply a matter of posturing to gain negotiating leverage with other countries; rather, he's perfectly willing to let tariffs fly as part of a long-term strategy of shoring up key American industries and fostering domestic investment.",
      "Whether that strategy ultimately pays off remains to be seen. For now, however, investors are raising their guard.",
      "\"A lot of articles have appeared in the last couple of sessions suggesting the White House is working on improving its 'messaging' on economic/tariff policies and that's great, but investors shouldn't be fooled about what's coming: The trade/tariff agenda represents a seismic change, and even if one buys the view that this will pay off over time, the near and medium-term will see enormous disruption,\" market analyst Adam Crisafulli, head of Vital Knowledge, told investors in a research note.",
      "To be sure, such disruption could bolster stocks if Mr. Trump were to reverse course on his salvo of tariffs set to be deployed next month. And despite the mounting concerns that such trade measures could tip the economy into a recession, BofA's survey shows that only 11% of fund managers expect a hard landing.",

    "summary": "Schumer said he is the \"best at winning Senate seats\" amid questions about his leadership after he voted to advance a GOP measure to fund the government.",
    "story": [
      "Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer argued Tuesday that he remains the \"best leader for the Senate\" despite backlash from some Democrats over his decision to allow a Republican-led measure to advance, avoiding a government shutdown.",
      "\"We have a lot of good people,\" Schumer said on \"CBS Mornings.\" \"But I am the best at winning Senate seats.\"",
      "Schumer initially signaled last week that his caucus would fight back against a partisan measure to keep the government funded. But a day later, he reluctantly pledged to advance the continuing resolution, delivering one of the Democratic votes necessary to propel the measure to passage. The move has prompted frustrations among some within his party, and questions about his leadership, but Schumer has repeatedly defended his decision.",
      "\"I knew when I took this vote there'd be a lot of protests, but I felt I had to do it for the future, not only of the Democratic Party, but the country,\" Schumer said, adding that \"as bad as that CR bill was \u2014 and it was bad \u2014 a shutdown is 10 times worse.\"",
      "Schumer said a shutdown would have given \"sole power\" to the executive branch and Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency to determine what remained open and closed during a shutdown, saying \"within two weeks, everyone would have been howling.\"",
      "The New York Democrat said he and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries had a strategy to try to get a bipartisan bill to keep the government funded. But they didn't expect that House Republican leadership would be able to keep its conference together to advance the partisan continuing resolution \u2014 a heavy lift that defied the typical political dynamics, with conservatives who routinely oppose continuing resolutions joining their party to support the measure.",
      "Schumer said a \"shutdown would have been the greatest disaster,\" putting the government in the hands of \"evil, nasty, nihilistic people\" like Musk, President Trump and OMB Director Russ Vought.",
      "\"We would have had half the federal government we have now,\" Schumer said. \"So I thought I did the thing a leader should do: Even when people don't see the danger around the curve, my job was to alert people to it \u2014 and I knew I'd get some bullets.\"",
      "On the question of his leadership, Schumer said he isn't going anywhere, citing his record as leader on winning Senate seats, including in 2021, when Democrats secured a majority in the upper chamber with two surprise runoff victories in Georgia. Schumer came to Congress in 1981, representing New York in the House before being elected to the Senate in 1998. He's led Democrats as leader in the Senate since 2017.",
      "Schumer said Democrats are fighting back against the Trump administration with a message focused on how GOP leaders want to \"screw every average American so they can get tax cuts for the rich,\" saying the strategy is \"beginning to work.\"",
      "\"If we keep at it every day, relentless fighting and showing how they're hurting people so badly, Trump's numbers will get much lower, and his both popularity, but also his effectiveness will decline,\" Schumer said. \"I believe that strategy will work.\"",
      "Tuesday's interview was held one day after\u00a0Schumer postponed events to promote his book, \"Antisemitism in America: A Warning,\" this week, citing security concerns following backlash from his move to keep the government funded. Schumer had a number of events scheduled this week in Maryland, New York City, Washington, D.C., Pennsylvania and California.",
      "Schumer said he wrote the book aimed at a number of audiences \u2014 including his \"friends on the left.\" He noted that while \"we've always seen antisemitism on the right,\" more recently \"a lot of it's trickled over to the left.\"",

      "Launched last June aboard Boeing's problem-plagued Starliner capsule, Wilmore and Williams are sharing the 17-hour ride home with Crew 9 commander Nick Hague and cosmonaut Alexander Gorbunov, who were launched to the station last September aboard the same SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule carrying all four of them home.",
      "\"On behalf of Crew 9, I'd like to say it was a privilege to call the station home, to live and work and be a part of a mission and a team that spans the globe, working together in cooperation for the benefit of humanity,\" Hague radioed as the Crew Dragon drifted away from the station.",
      "\"To our colleagues and dear friends who remain on the station ... we know the station's in great hands. We're excited to see what you guys are going to accomplish.\"",
      "Splashdown off Florida's Gulf Coast south of Tallahassee is expected at 5:57 p.m. EDT.",
      "For Wilmore and Williams, the long overdue trip back to Earth will wrap up a repeatedly extended mission totaling 286 days and 7 hours spanning 4,576 orbits and 121 million miles. They originally expected to spend just eight days or so in orbit.",
      "How will the astronauts return to Earth?",
      "After bidding their station crewmates farewell, Hague and company floated into their Crew Dragon and undocked from the ISS Harmony module's space-facing port at 1:05 a.m. EDT.",
      "Sixteen hours later, the flight plan called for an automated seven-and-a-half-minute de-orbit thruster firing starting at 5:11 p.m. to slow the ship down for re-entry.",
      "After a 27-minute free fall, the spacecraft was expected to plunge back into the discernible atmosphere for the final 12 minutes of the descent, making a parachute-assisted splashdown off the Florida panhandle's Gulf Coast a few minutes before 6 p.m.",
      "A SpaceX recovery ship will be stationed nearby to haul the spacecraft on board so the crew can be helped out of the Crew Dragon's cabin and onto stretchers for initial medical checks.",
      "CBS News will have live coverage of the astronauts' return starting at about 5:50 p.m. EDT. Watch in the video player above or download the free CBS News app for your mobile or streaming device.",
      "Why were the astronauts stuck longer at the ISS?",
      "Wilmore and Williams launched to the International Space Station last June 5 on the first piloted test flight of Boeing's Starliner. The spacecraft suffered multiple propulsion system helium leaks and thruster problems during rendezvous with the space station, and NASA eventually decided to keep them on the station and to bring the Starliner down, without its crew, by remote control.",
      "NASA launched the next crew rotation mission \u2014 Crew 9 \u2014 in September carrying just two crew members, Hague and Gorbunov, instead of four. Wilmore and Williams then joined the Crew 9 fliers aboard the ISS for a normal-duration six-month mission.",
      "By keeping them in space as part of Crew 9, NASA was able to minimize the disruption to the ISS crew rotation sequence while maintaining a full slate of experiments and research.",
      "NASA cleared the way for Crew 9's return to Earth by launching four replacements \u2014 Crew 10 commander Anne McClain, pilot Nichole Ayers, cosmonaut Kirill Peskov and Japanese astronaut Takuya Onishi \u2014 last Friday.",
      "Normal practice calls for a five-day \"handover\" between crews so the new arrivals can be fully briefed on the ins and outs of station operations and maintenance. But in this case, handover was shortened to just one day to take advantage of predicted favorable splashdown weather in the Gulf.",
      "All station astronauts spend two hours a day exercising to minimize bone and muscle loss in the weightlessness of space. Even so, Wilmore and Williams will face extensive rehabilitation over the next several weeks and months as their bodies re-adapt to the unfamiliar tug of gravity.",
      "Hague and Gorbunov, who spent spent 171 days in space, will re-adapt more quickly, perhaps, but both will require physical therapy.",
      "Was this the longest any U.S. astronaut has stayed in space?",
      "While 286 days is a long flight by normal NASA standards, it's well short of the U.S. record for a single flight \u2014 371 days, set by astronaut Frank Rubio in 2022-23.",
      "Ironically, Rubio's record was the result of another extended mission, this one the result of a major coolant leak in the Russian Soyuz he launched aboard. The Russians decided not to bring the crew down aboard their original spacecraft and instead launched a replacement.",
      "As a result, Rubio ended up spending a little more than a full year in space, twice as long as he originally expected.",
      "Given Williams' two previous stays aboard the space station, she will move up to No. 2 on the list of most experienced U.S. astronauts with 608 days in space overall. Only former astronaut Peggy Whitson has more time aloft, 675 days over four flights. Wilmore's total across three flights will stand at 464 days aloft.",

    "published": "Tue, 18 Mar 2025 08:59:39 -0400",
    "summary": "Barred from catching salmon off the California coast, fishermen have been running boat tours to stay afloat.",
    "story": [
      "William Smith has long fished the California coast for salmon, taking avid anglers out on his boat in hopes they'll get to wrestle with and reel in the prized catch.",
      "But not anymore.",
      "Smith, known as \"Capt. Smitty,\" now spends time on the seas with aspiring whale watchers, or scattering the ashes of the deceased \u2014 whatever it takes to stay afloat since salmon fishing was barred in California two years ago due to dwindling stocks. Smith said a rise in the Bay Area's Hindu and Buddhist communities has made sea burials more popular, and he now does more than 200 a year \u2014 and that's helping him pay off his $250,000 boat engine.",
      "\"The bills keep going, whether I've got a fishery or not,\" said Smith, who runs Riptide Sportfishing in Half Moon Bay, California. \"There's no season on when people die.\"",
      "California's sport and commercial fishermen have been walloped by two years of salmon closures and are bracing for a potential third, which they blame on a years-earlier drought and state and federal water management policies they say have made it tough for the species to thrive. The closures have taken a toll on people's livelihoods in coastal communities where salmon, fishermen say, is a special fish.",
      "Salmon must swim upstream to lay their eggs, and young fish make their way out to the ocean through California's waterways \u2014 something done more easily when cool water flows are abundant. The fishery has long been strained and the Pacific Fishery Management Council, which manages West Coast fisheries, said there will be very limited salmon fishing this year in California, if at all. A decision is due in April.",
      "The dim outlook comes as President Donald Trump has ordered officials to find ways to put \"people over fish\" and route more water to farmers in California's crop-rich Central Valley and residents of its densely-populated cities. Trump has professed his love for farmers and contends too much heed is paid to the tiny delta smelt, a federally-threatened species seen as an indicator of the health of California's Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta.",
      "But salmon depend on this same water system for their survival. And some in the fishing community are wondering if fishermen aren't people, too.",
      "\"We are people that are hardworking and it's our jobs on the line,\" said Sarah Bates, a commercial fishing captain in San Francisco. She said local markets have been devastated by the salmon closures and Bay Area restaurants aren't snapping up halibut or other catch as they did salmon.",
      "Decline in salmon population",
      "The history of commercial salmon fishing in California dates back more than a century, and in the 1970s and 1980s the fishery thrived off the state's coast. Over time, salmon fishing has declined with swings in stocks amid volatile weather patterns in a drought-prone state and water management decisions about when surface water, and how much of it, should flow to farms, burgeoning cities and the ecologically-sensitive bay delta.",
      "California's salmon fishing industry includes commercial fleets and charters that take anglers out for recreation.",
      "Jamie O'Neill, owner of Seattle-based Dock Street Brokers, said many of California's commercial salmon fishermen are getting out of the business, selling their permits or simply letting them expire. Permits now sell for a fraction of what they used to, and there are fewer than 900 permits compared to 1,200 in 2010, he said.",
      "Charter operators, meanwhile, have branched out to host boat tours and party cruises, especially since short trips require little fuel and can help offset the cost of boat maintenance.",
      "While fishermen can still catch halibut, cod and striped bass along the extensive Pacific coastline, they say without the all-popular King Salmon, anglers just aren't coming like before. Each fish requires a different bait and technique, and a fast-swimming salmon is a fighter that anglers aspire to catch.",
      "\"One is hamburger, and one is filet mignon,\" said Andy Guiliano, whose sportfishing boat the Pacific Pearl in Emeryville has expanded its historic tour offerings since the closure. \"It makes the cash register ring.\"",

      "\"People have been waiting decades for this,\" the president said of the release of files related to the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. Mr. Trump, who was speaking at the Kennedy Center Monday, added that he didn't believe the material, \"approximately 80,000 pages,\" would be redacted.",
      "\"I said during the campaign that I'd do it, and I'm a man of my word,\" the president said of the impending release.",
      "Last month, the FBI said it had discovered roughly 2,400 records related to the assassination during a search stemming from Mr. Trump's executive action ordering files related to the 1963 killing to be declassified.",
      "The bureau said that the documents, which have been inventoried and digitized, \"were previously unrecognized as related to the JFK assassination case file.\" The FBI in February was transferring the records to the National Archives and Records Administration to be included in the ongoing declassification process that has been ongoing. The bureau did not say what the records contain.",

      "Congress in 1992 enacted the President John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection Act, which required all assassination-related material be kept in a single collection within the National Archives and be publicly released.

    "summary": "The government claimed it was not bound by the judge's order to block flights carrying gang members to El Salvador because it wasn't in writing.",
    "story": [
      "A federal judge admonished the Justice Department Monday for disobeying his order to turn around two planes en route to El Salvador that were carrying alleged Tren de Aragua gang members. He also demanded explanations about removal flights ordered since President Trump invoked the Alien Enemies Act\u00a0Saturday.",
      "During a hearing on the Trump administration's compliance with his order, D.C District Chief Judge James Boasberg demanded answers by Tuesday at noon to clarify what occurred Saturday \u2014 both before and after he blocked the government's removal flights. He asked the government whether additional planes have left the U.S. with Tren de Aragua gang members, and he wants a timeline showing when the flights took off from the U.S. and landed in El Salvador and a count of remaining members of the gang in U.S. custody.",
      "Boasberg also demanded detailed timing on when President Trump's order invoking the Alien Enemies Act was signed and went into effect. The 1798 act is a wartime authority allowing the president to detain and deport noncitizens. Mr. Trump is utilizing the act to detain and deport all Venezuelan migrants 14 years of age and older who are suspected of being members of the Tren de Aragua gang.",
      "A Justice Department attorney argued that because the judge did not put his order demanding the planes to return to the U.S. in writing, the government was not bound by it, but he added that even if the order had been written, the president had the authority to keep the flights en route to their final destination.",
      "\"You're telling me your first argument is when I said those things, because I didn't say it in a minute order that the plaintiffs didn't have to turn around, you didn't have to comply?\" Boasberg said. \"You're saying that you felt you could disregard it because it wasn't in a written order?\"",
      "The attorney did not provide details about how many deportation flights left Saturday, claiming that there were \"operational issues\" prohibiting him from answering. When Judge Boesberg mentioned the two flights that departed Texas at 5:26 p.m. and 5:45 p.m. local time, the attorney said that he was \"not at liberty\" to provide information about the flights.",
      "It sparked a tense back and forth between Judge Boesberg and the government over whether or not it was asserting the flight information was classified.",
      "The Justice Department also argued that because the planes were over international waters and airspace by the time the judge ordered them to turn around, that Boasberg no longer had jurisdiction over the migrants.",
      "The judge responded that his order applied to the planes, regardless of where they were in the air.",
      "The Trump administration said the two planes had left before the judge made his decision, and a third plane left for El Salvador shortly afterwards, though details about the passengers on that plane are unclear.",
      "Despite Boasberg's ruling, 261 people were deported to El Salvador Saturday,137 of whom were removed under the Alien Enemies Act over alleged gang ties, a senior administration official said.",
      "The judge's ruling responded to a federal civil lawsuit against Mr. Trump and other administration officials filed Saturday by five Venezuelan men in immigration custody in Texas and New York local jails.",
      "Boasberg's ruling prevents the deportations of the plaintiffs and migrants for 14 days. The Justice Department appealed that decision, arguing the D.C. federal court has no authority over the case because none of the five men are being held in the District of Columbia.",
      "White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt wrote on X Saturday night that the \"written order and the Administration's actions do not conflict,\" and said a \"single judge in a single city cannot direct the movements of an aircraft carrying foreign alien terrorists who were physically expelled from U.S. soil.\"",
      "Wrapping up the hearing, Boasberg said he'd issue a written order quickly because \"apparently my oral orders don't seem to carry much weight\" with the Justice Department.",
      "Before the hearing, the Justice Department filed an appeal to the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals requesting Boasberg's removal from the case, arguing that his actions in the case have been an \"inappropriate exercise of jurisdiction\" and claiming he had followed \"highly unusual and improper procedures,\" in his hearing on Saturday evening.",

    "story": [
      "Hollywood actors, directors and other creatives are pushing back on the loosening of AI regulations, with more than 420 entertainment industry insiders signing an open letter urging the government to uphold copyright laws that apply to artificial intelligence.",
      "The group, led by actress Natasha Lyonne, also includes Bette Midler, Aubrey Plaza, Ava DuVernay, Paul Simon, Mark Ruffalo and hundreds of others.",
      "The letter states that OpenAI and Google have recently recommended the government remove \"all legal protections and existing guardrails surrounding copyright law protections for the training of Artificial Intelligence.\" The group believes loosening copyright laws to help AI learn would come at the expense of creative industries.",
      "OpenAI, a major U.S. artificial intelligence company, and Google\u00a0both wrote to the Office of Science and Technology Policy about an AI action plan this month, making the case that it would be beneficial for AI developers to be able to use copyrighted materials to train AI.",
      "Google argued that exceptions to copyright laws would allow the use of \"copyrighted, publicly available material for AI training without significantly impacting rights holders,\" and that fair use and text-and-data mining exceptions would balance existing copyright rules.",
      "Actors have long fought against the expansion of AI, with fears that it would undermine their creative work. One of the major setbacks during the 2024 SAG-AFTRA union negotiations with major production companies was that the parties could not agree on AI regulations in the film industry.",
      "SAG-AFTRA, the union that represents about 160,000 performers, wanted film and TV producers to obtain consent from actors to create and use their digital replicas. They also fought for actors to be compensated at their usual rate \u2013 even if the role is performed by a digital replica of them.",
      "After a 118-day strike during the contract negotiations, SAG-AFTRA and the actors it represents won, and the deal included rules about consent and compensation when AI is used in film and TV shows.",
      "California Gov. Gavin Newsom signed two bills into law last year\u00a0that protect actors from artificial intelligence replicas. One requires labor contracts to specify if there will be AI-generated replicas of an actor, while the other bans the commercial use of digital replicas of performers who are deceased in any media \u2014 including TV shows, films and video games \u2014 without getting consent from their estates.",
      "The number of artists who signed the open letter is growing, and also includes Ben Stiller, Ayo Edebiri, model and actress Cara Delevingne, directors Guillermo del Toro and Taika Waititi, \"SNL\" actress Chloe Fineman and Oscar-winner Cate Blanchett. The group initially asked the government for a response by Saturday at 11:59 p.m. but has continued to collect signatures on the letter as that deadline has elapsed.",
      "The letter states that the entertainment industry supports more than 2.3 million jobs in the U.S. and pays more than $229 billion in wages annually and argues that \"AI companies are asking to undermine this economic and cultural strength by weakening copyright protections for the films, television series, artworks, writing, music, and voices used to train AI models at the core of multi-billion dollar corporate valuations.\"",
      "Last month, Vice President JD Vance warned European Union countries against overregulation of AI during the Artificial Intelligence Action summit in Paris, France. While speaking to tech executives and world leaders, Vance said the excessive regulation of the AI sector could \"kill a transformative industry just as it's taking off.\"",
      "In January, President Trump said that the U.S. would invest up to $500 billion in private sector investment to build artificial intelligence infrastructure in the country as a way to keep up with competitors in China.",
      "Upon taking office in January, Mr. Trump repealed former President Joe Biden's executive order\u00a0to keep the development of AI safe, secure and trustworthy and also put out a National Security Memo\u00a0that outlined the framework to develop AI in government and national security, according to the American Civil Liberties Union.",
      "The ACLU, which works to protect people's rights in the U.S., called Mr. Trump's rollback of AI guidelines a \"grave mistake,\" saying the guardrails put in place by the Biden administration were \"common sense steps,\" including transparency and regular testing \"to ensure that AI tools follow existing laws protecting civil rights and civil liberties, accurately perform the tasks they're given, and don't waste agency resources.\"",

      "The FBI recommends that travelers \"be vigilant of their surroundings and use caution\" while traveling. Their advice includes establishing points of contact for family members to reference in case of an emergency, using only authorized taxis or shuttles, and being on the lookout for suspicious activity, including someone following you or \"new acquaintances who probe for information about you or who attempt to get you involved in what could become a compromising situation.\"",
      "The FBI also recommends avoiding illegal and \"improper\" actions as well as \"offers of sexual companionship,\" which may lead to a \"room raid, photography and blackmail.\"",

      "Anyone traveling abroad should check the travel advisories for their intended destination, the FBI says. Travel advisories range from Level 1 to Level 4 and are regularly reviewed and updated for each country. The levels are based off several factors, including crime levels, threats of terrorism, civil unrest, health concerns and the possibility of a natural disaster, according to the State Department. A country may have multiple advisories, if certain regions are known to be more of a risk than others.",
      "In Level 1 countries, travelers should exercise normal precautions and be aware that all international travel includes some level of risk. Level 2 recommends increased caution due to \"heightened risks to safety and security.\" Level 3 suggests Americans reconsider travel to that destination, and Level 4 advises against any travel to that location.",

Overseas, the deaths of American tourists in\u00a0Mexico\u00a0and the\u00a0Bahamas\u00a0have been linked to carbon monoxide poisoning.",

      "Details surrounding Konanki's disappearance have begun to emerge as the international investigation continues. Here's what we know so far about her case.",
      "Konanki seen on video walking to beach",
      "Konanki, 20, is from Chantilly, Virginia, a Washington, D.C., suburb, and attends college in Pittsburgh. She has permanent residency in the United States as well as citizenship in India. She arrived in the Dominican Republic for spring break on March 3 and was vacationing with a group of friends, five other women, according to investigators and her parents.",
      "She\u00a0has been missing\u00a0since Thursday, March 6, after surveillance video showed her, three of her friends and two other American men walk toward the beach area outside the Riu Rep\u00fablica hotel. The video was from around 4:15 a.m., investigators in the Dominican Republic said.",
      "Power outages at the hotel may have prompted guests to move outdoors around that time, the hotel said in a statement. An earlier surveillance video showed Konanki and one of her friends hugging at the hotel bar.",
      "One of the men in the group walking to the beach has been identified as 22-year-old Joshua Riibe, an American college student. In the footage, Konanki and Riibe are seen walking with their arms around each other.",
      "Video shows the other four individuals later returning to the hotel, but Konanki and Riibe stayed behind on the beach, a police source said. The last sighting of Konanki and Riibe in the water happened around 4:50 a.m., according to Loudon County Sheriff Mike Chapman, whose office in Virginia is involved in the investigation.",
      "Riibe told police he and Konanki were swept into the ocean by a large wave and both struggled against rough seas. He said he believed Konanki got out of the water but was not certain, according to a person with direct knowledge of Riibe's statements to U.S. investigators.",
      "He is presumed to be the last person who saw Konanki alive.",
      "Konanki's disappearance is so far being investigated as a missing persons case, not a criminal investigation.",
      "The Dominican Republic's attorney general said investigators were exploring whether Konanki drowned, but not ruling out the possibility of foul play.",
      "Chapman said \"it's hard to say\" whether there are indications Konanki's disappearance was anything other than an accident.",
      "\"We know that at about 4:50 a.m. was the last sighting that we had of them in the water. We don't know what happened after that,\" Chapman said in a \"CBS Mornings\" interview. \"And we also don't know what happened between the time that [Riibe] claimed to have come out of the water and the time that he actually left the beach, so it's really hard to say. It'd be speculative on my part to assume or presume anything at this point.\"",
      "Konanki's family seeking closure",
      "The Loudoun County Sheriff's Office told CBS News that Konanki's family has requested that she be declared deceased, expressed gratitude to investigators for their work, and expressed a desire for closure following her disappearance in the Dominican Republic.",
      "The family provided the request in writing to the sheriff's office, according to spokesperson Thomas Julia. Julia said the family made a similar request to Dominican authorities.",
      "Konanki's family did not immediately respond to a request for comment. CBS News has learned that their written request referenced Riibe's cooperation with investigators and a lack of evidence collected to date that would suggest foul play was involved in Konanki's disappearance.",
      "Chapman said the family has expressed their belief that she drowned.",
      "\"While a final decision to make such a declaration rests with authorities in the Dominican Republic, we will support the Konanki family in every way possible as we continue to review the evidence and information made available to us in the course of this investigation,\" he said.",
      "Riibe faces questioning, says he is cooperating",
      "Riibe has been in Punta Cana for questioning since the investigation got underway.",
      "Authorities confiscated Riibe's passport and he has been confined to a hotel with police escorts anywhere he goes, according to the law firm representing him, Guzm\u00e1n Ariza. Yeni Berenice Reynoso, the Dominican attorney general, was interrogating Riibe directly, attorneys with Guzm\u00e1n Ariza said. A hearing for Riibe's release was set to take place Tuesday, after his attorneys pushed in legal documents for his freedom given the absence of any criminal charge.",
      "Riibe and his parents, Tina and Albert Riibe, extended \"deep sorrow and solidarity\" with Konanski's family in a statement released through his attorney.",
      "\"Above all, we wish to contribute to the search efforts and understand the anguish and uncertainty they are going through and we share the hope that Sudiksha will be found as soon as possible,\" the statement said. \"Joshua Riibe is deeply dismayed by her disappearance and has fully cooperated in the search and clarification of the facts from the very beginning.\"",
      "Chapman told \"CBS Mornings\" that Riibe was \"very forthcoming\" with sheriff's detectives who traveled to the Dominican Republic to speak to him, and did not \"seem to hesitate on answering any of the questions that we threw his way.\"",
      "Chapman noted there was \"nothing that would really make us feel as though there was anything untrue coming from Joshua.\"",
      "Originally from Iowa, Riibe is a college senior at St. Cloud State University in Minnesota, where he is pursuing a degree in land surveying.",
      "His family in their statement described him as \"a beloved son, brother, and friend, known for his kind nature, sense of humor, and commitment to his community.\"",
      "They also shared concerns about the \"irregular conditions\" of his detainment in Punta Cana, where, they said, he had been \"subjected to extensive questioning without the presence of official translators or legal counsel until Wednesday, March 12.\" The family retained a lawyer \"to initiate legal actions ensuring his safety and the protection of his rights throughout this process,\" according to the statement.",
      "Intensifying search efforts",
      "More than 300 police and other officials, with support from the FBI, are searching the air, sea and land to locate her, Dominican President Luis Abinader said. The Dominican Republic National Police said they have assembled a new \"high-level commission\" to oversee the case, and Interpol has\u00a0issued a global police alert at the request of investigators.",
      "\"We are concerned,\" Abinader said at a news conference on March 10. \"All government agencies are searching \u2026 because the latest information we have from one of them, from the last person who was with the young woman, what he says according to the reports is that a wave, while on the beach, crashed into them.\"",
      "Dominican Republic National Police said in a statement March 11 that they were \"re-interviewing targeted individuals who were in the victim's proximity at the time of her disappearance.\" Investigators said the individuals included \"hotel employees where Konanki and her companions were staying, with the goal of gathering information to corroborate her movements, interactions, and any relevant details for the investigation.\"",

      "At least 12 people including a popular musician died Monday when a small plane crashed into the Caribbean sea quickly after taking off from the Honduran island of Roatan, officials and local media said. The Lanhsa Airlines plane departed at nightfall from Roatan, one of the central American country's main tourist destinations, headed for the port of La Ceiba on the Honduran mainland.",

    "story": [
      "Johannesburg \u2014\u00a0It sounds like the plot of a horror movie. Researchers stuck on a remote research base in Antarctica send an email out to the world, pleading for help as a colleague is accused of assault.",
      "But this was real. An urgent email was sent by a researcher at South Africa's isolated Sanae IV base in Antarctica accusing a man, one of the nine team members, of becoming violent and mentally unstable. In the email sent to a journalist at South Africa's Sunday Times newspaper, the researcher, who has not been identified publicly, requests immediate action to ensure the team's safety.",
      "According to the Times, the researcher alleged that the male team member had physically assaulted a colleague, threatened to kill a different colleague and sexually assaulted another. However, South African officials later said the report of a sexual assault was not correct.",
      "\"His behavior has become increasingly egregious, and I am experiencing significant difficulty in feeling secure in his presence,\" the newspaper quoted the researcher as writing, adding: \"It is imperative that immediate action is taken to ensure my safety and the safety of all employees.\"",
      "South Africa's Department of Forestry, Fisheries and the Environment released a statement saying the alleged assault at the base was reported on Feb. 27, triggering a response plan that saw the government agency use \"trained professionals\" to mediate. The department said those mediators continued to engage with the team at the base on \"an almost daily basis.\"",
      "According to the agency, the alleged perpetrator had \"willingly participated in further psychological evaluation, has shown remorse and is willingly cooperative to follow any interventions that are recommended.\"",
      "The statement went on to say the male perpetrator had written an apology to the victim and was willing \"to verbally apologize to other team members.\"",
      "South African Environment Minister Dion George told CBS News on Tuesday that \"the situation at the base remains calm and all is under control.\"",
      "\"I will be keeping close contact with the base to ensure it remains that way,\" said George, adding that a \"team of psychologists and other experts\" were also in \"direct and constant\" contact with the team.",
      "When pressed on what else he could do to ensure the safety of the team, George said he was \"considering available options.\"",
      "Those options may be few, as severe weather conditions have completely cut the base off from the sea. The base sits on stilts near a cliff edge \u2014 a row of buildings that the team will remain in until December, the heart of the Antarctic summer, when a ship is set to depart from South Africa to make the near-15-day journey to retrieve them.",
      "An emergency evacuation, at significant cost, would be required to get the team out before then.",
      "The environment department said it also activated a legal \"labor relations process to investigate the [claim of] physical assault and alleged sexual harassment.\"",
      "There have been several incidents in the past with team members at the remote base threatening violence, and at least two other team members have been evacuated during previous expeditions.",
      "The latest incident has fueled discussions about the reliability of the psychometric tests given to team members before they're deployed to the isolated station. Scientists sent previously to the base and others like it have spoken of how lonely it is, surrounded by white and silence and cut off from the rest of the world, and of the toll that can take on someone's mental health.",

    "story": [
      "Deir al-Balah, Gaza Strip \u2014 Israel has launched new strikes in the Gaza Strip, killing more than 400 people, according to the Palestinian territory's Hamas-run Health Ministry, and promising to wield \"increasing military force\" after talks on further hostage releases stalled, according to officials on both sides of the war. The resumption of Israel's war against Hamas on Monday came after almost two months of relative calm in Gaza under a ceasefire the U.S. helped to broker, but which Israel and Hamas could not agree on how to continue.",
      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said in a statement its military is \"currently attacking targets of the Hamas terrorist organization throughout the Gaza Strip, with the aim of achieving the war goals as determined by the political echelon, including the release of all our hostages \u2014 living and dead.\"",
      "\"From now on, Israel will act against Hamas with increasing military force,\" the prime minister's office said.",
      "The health ministry in Gaza, a densely populated coastal enclave that has been run by the U.S.- and Israeli-designated terrorist organization Hamas for almost two decades, said at least 404 people had been killed in Israel's fresh strikes by midday on Tuesday. Video from the territory showed bodies lined up on the floors of hospitals as more casualties streamed in.",
      "The statement from Netanyahu's office said Israel was resuming strikes because of Hamas' repeated refusals to release its hostages and its rejection of all offers it received from the U.S. presidential envoy Steve Witkoff and mediators.",
      "\"If Hamas does not release all the kidnapped, the gates of hell will open in Gaza and Hamas' murderers and rapists will meet the IDF with forces they have never known before,\" Defense Minister Israel Katz said. \"We will not stop fighting until all the kidnapped return home and all the war's goals are achieved.\"",
      "Over the weekend, Witkoff warned that Hamas must release living hostages immediately \"or pay a severe price.\"",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Monday evening that the Trump administration was consulted by the Israelis on their attacks in Gaza.",
      "\"Hamas could have released hostages to extend the ceasefire but instead chose refusal and war,\" National Security Council spokesman Brian Hughes told CBS News on Monday.",
      "Hostages families, U.N. and Egypt condemn resumption of war",
      "The group representing the Israeli hostages' families condemned Netanyahu's decision to resume the fighting, accusing him of a \"complete deception,\" arguing that it would endanger the remaining captives, and quickly organizing a new protest against the move.",
      "\"The families' greatest fear has come true \u2014 the Israeli government has chosen to give up on the abductees. We are shocked, angry and anxious about the deliberate disruption of the process to return our loved ones from Hamas captivity,\" the Hostages and Missing Families Forum said in a statement.",
      "\"Returning to fighting before the last abductee is returned will come at the cost of the 59 abductees who are still in Gaza and could be saved and returned,\" the group said, accusing Netanyahu's government of having \"refused to declare an end to the war in order to implement the next steps in the [ceasefire] deal and return all the abductees.\"",
      "The forum dismissed Netanyahu's claim that the resumption of fighting was intended to secure the remaining hostages' release as \"a complete deception.\"",
      "The forum said \"families are now making their way to Jerusalem and calling on the people of Israel to stand with them\" in a protest on Tuesday. \"There is nothing more urgent than this! With each passing day, the danger to the hostages grows. Military pressure could further endanger their lives and complicate efforts to bring them home safely.\"",
      "United Nations human rights chief Volker Turk said he was \"horrified by last night's Israeli airstrikes and shelling in Gaza, which killed hundreds, according to the Ministry of Health in the strip,\" adding that it would \"add tragedy onto tragedy.\"",
      "Farhan Haq, deputy spokesperson for U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, said the U.N. chief was \"shocked by the Israeli airstrikes in Gaza, in which a meaningful number of civilians have been killed. He strongly appeals for the ceasefire to be respected, for unimpeded humanitarian assistance to be reestablished and for the remaining hostages to be released unconditionally.\"",
      "Egypt, which helped negotiate the ceasefire along with the U.S. and Qatar, issued a statement condemning Israel's actions, which it called \"a flagrant violation of the ceasefire agreement and a dangerous escalation that threatens to have dire consequences for the stability of the region.\"",
      "\"Egypt reiterates its complete rejection of all Israeli attacks aimed at re-igniting tension in the region and thwarting efforts aimed at calming the situation and restoring stability. It calls on the international community to intervene immediately to halt the Israeli aggression on the Gaza Strip and prevent the region from re-entering a new cycle of violence and counter-violence,\" Egypt's foreign ministry said.",
      "Hamas says Israel \"fully responsible for violating and overturning\" ceasefire",
      "Hamas also condemned the attacks, accusing Israel of breaching the ceasefire and putting the fate of the remaining hostages in jeopardy.",
      "In a statement, Hamas said it would hold Netanyahu's government \"fully responsible for the repercussions of the treacherous aggression on Gaza, and for the defenseless civilians and our besieged Palestinian people, who are subjected to a brutal war and a systematic policy of starvation.\"",
      "\"Netanyahu and his extremist government have decided to overturn the ceasefire agreement, exposing the prisoners in Gaza to an unknown fate,\" said Hamas, adding a demand for the U.S. and its negotiating partners Egypt and Qatar to \"hold Netanyahu and the Zionist occupation fully responsible for violating and overturning the agreement.\"",
      "In a separate statement, Hamas spokesperson Abdul Latif al-Qanou said Israel's \"coordination with the U.S. administration prior to the attacks confirms the U.S. partnership in the genocide perpetrated against our people and its role in covering up Israeli war crimes.\"",
      "What happened during the ceasefire?",
      "The new strikes come amid the Muslim holy month of Ramadan and after nearly two months of a ceasefire to pause the 17-month-long war that saw dozens of hostages released in exchange for nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners. The first phase of the ceasefire ended on March 1 but the pause in major fighting held until Monday.",
      "Since the first phase of the ceasefire ended, the sides have not been able to agree on a way forward to a second phase aimed at releasing the nearly 60 remaining hostages and ending the war altogether. Netanyahu had repeatedly threatened to resume the war, and President Trump had also issued several warnings and ultimatums to Hamas \u2014 some contradicting the agreed-upon terms of the ceasefire \u2014  as negotiations on a second phase of the ceasefire struggled to materialize.",
      "Egypt, Qatar and the United States had been trying to mediate the next steps in the ceasefire.",
      "Earlier in the month, Israel cut off aid into Gaza, stopping the entry of all goods and supplies into the Palestinian territory. Israel said the aid blockade was aimed at pressuring Hamas to accept a\u00a0proposal drafted by the Trump administration to extend the first phase\u00a0of the ceasefire. Under the proposal, Israel had demanded Hamas immediately hand over half of the remaining hostages held in Gaza, which would have been a significant change in the terms initially agreed to under the deal brokered by the U.S., Qatar and Egypt.",
      "On Friday, Hamas said it had accepted a proposal from mediators to release one living American-Israeli hostage and the bodies of four dual-nationals who had died in captivity. Netanyahu's office cast doubt on the offer last week, accusing the U.S. and Israeli-designated terrorist group of trying to manipulate talks underway in Qatar on the next stage of the Israel-Hamas ceasefire.",
      "In a separate Friday statement, Hamas official Husam Badran reaffirmed what he said was Hamas' commitment to fully implementing the ceasefire agreement in all its phases, warning that any Israeli deviation from the terms would return negotiations to square one.",
      "The agreement had called for negotiations to begin on the ceasefire's more difficult second phase, in which the remaining hostages would be released and Israeli forces would withdraw from Gaza. Hamas is believed to have 24 living hostages and the bodies of 35 others.",
      "The war erupted with Hamas' Oct 7, 2023, cross-border terrorist attack, which killed some 1,200 people and took 250 others hostage. Israel responded with a military offensive that killed over 48,000 Palestinians, according to local health officials, and displaced an estimated 90% of Gaza's population. The territory's Health Ministry doesn't differentiate between civilians and militants, but says over half of the dead have been women and children.",
      "While the ceasefire largely halted the fighting, Israel has left troops in Gaza throughout the past two months and continued to strike targets, claiming that Palestinians were trying to carry out attacks or approaching troops in no-go zones.   A number of strikes earlier Monday killed a total of 10 people, according to Palestinian officials.",

Harry currently lives in California with his wife, Meghan, and their children.",
      "Applications for visas to live in the United States ask about current and historical drug use. Admission of drug use can lead to visa applications being rejected, but immigration officers have discretion to make their final decisions on a number of factors. Lying on visa applications can lead to lifetime bans on entering the U.S..",
      "\"There's a lot of discretion that the government has, but merely admitting to drug use very often is not disqualifying from entering the country, but lying about drug use can be more serious and potentially could be disqualifying,\" CBS News legal contributor Jessica Levinson said.",
      "The Heritage Foundation alleges that Harry may have lied about his past drug use on his application. Their allegations center around claims Harry made in his memoir, published in January 2023, where he described using various types of drugs.",
      "Cocaine \"wasn't much fun, and it didn't make me particularly happy, as it seemed to make everyone around me, but it did make me feel different, and that was the main goal,\" Harry wrote.",
      "He also wrote: \"Marijuana is different. That actually really did help me.\"",
      "The Heritage Foundation lodged a freedom of information request with the Department of Homeland Security in 2023, not long after his book was published, seeking access to Harry's immigration documents.",
      "\"Harry has publicly admitted to extensive illegal drug use. What do we submit this means? That Harry seems to have received special treatment: the DHS looked the other way if the Prince answered truthfully, or it looked the other way if the Prince lied on his visa application. Either action would be wrong,\" Nile Gardiner from the Heritage Foundation said in an online post in 2024.",
      "Harry and Meghan moved to the U.S. in 2020 after stepping down as working members of Britain's royal family.",

      "Washington \u2014 President Trump's dismantling of the government-funded Voice of America will pave the way for America's adversaries to have greater influence abroad, predicted the agency's director Michael Abramowitz.",
      "After Mr. Trump signed an executive order that seeks to make sweeping cuts at the nation's largest international broadcaster, about 1,300 employees, including Abramowitz, learned over the weekend they had been placed on administrative leave, and another 500 contractors were terminated. Mr. Trump accused the news agency, which began broadcasting during World War II, of spreading \"radical propaganda.\"",
      "In an interview with CBS News Monday, Abramowitz called VOA \"an incredibly important soft power tool\" for the U.S. and said shuttering it would be a \"self-inflicted blow\" to national security because VOA's news coverage helps to combat Chinese, Russian and Iranian disinformation.",
      "\"If America pulls off the playing field and cedes it to our adversaries, then they're going to be telling the narratives that people around the world are going to be hearing, and that can't be good for America,\" he said. \"They're going to be hearing an anti-America narrative. We need to fight that with truth.\"",
      "VOA reports news about the U.S. in nearly 50 languages \u2014 with much of its focus trained on countries that lack a free press. By law, the broadcasts do not air inside the U.S., but news programming is viewed widely \u2014 with an audience of about 360 million people per week worldwide.",
      "\"We are getting through to an audience that might otherwise hear propaganda,\" Abramowitz said, adding that many VOA journalists are from countries under authoritarian control. \"The major challenge for the United States in general is this global information war in which countries like China and Russia are essentially really having our lunch. \u2026 So, I really feel that we need an organization that is accurate, unbiased, objective, and that tells the truth about America to the rest of the world in the languages that they understand.\"",
      "\"That has never been more important with a sea of lies and disinformation that are going on around the world,\" he added.",
      "Still, Abramowitz acknowledged\tthat VOA, which has a $270 million annual budget, could be reformed and that it should \"not be resistant to change.\"",
      "\"I'm not saying it has to be the way it's always been,\" Abramowitz said. \"Change is great. Change is needed. Change is required.\"",
      "\"I don't personally think it's a waste of taxpayer money,\" he argued. \"Does that mean that it has to be a $270 million budget? Maybe it could be [$240 million], maybe it could be [$200 million]. Look, we are in an era where the taxpayer expects a smaller, more modernized, more streamlined government.\"",
      "He defended VOA's journalists as non-partisan and said if they harbored any bias, it is against totalitarianism, tyranny and authoritarianism.",
      "\"If you care about a free Iran, if you care about more openness in China, if you care about freedom in Russia, if you care about freedom in Venezuela and Nicaragua, then you have an incredibly important tool in VOA to help push back and to get accurate and objective information into these places that don't have it,\" he said. \"That is incredibly important.\"",

    "story": [
      "Johannesburg\u00a0\u2014 The Trump administration expelled South Africa's Ambassador Ebrahim Rasool on Friday, giving him 72 hours to leave the country. In a social media post, Secretary of State Marco Rubio called Rasool a \"race-baiting politician who hates America\" and President Trump.",
      "In a diplomatic notice, the Department of State said that it would no longer recognize Ambassador Rasool as a \"member of the [South African] mission from today, March 17,\" adding that \"his privileges and immunities will cease\" and that he was \"persona non grata\" in the United States.",
      "The expulsion came after Rasool, during a webinar hosted by the South African Mapungubwe Institute for Strategic Reflection, accused Mr. Trump of pursuing policies and practices that the diplomat characterized as \"a white supremacist response to growing demographic diversity in the United States.\"",
      "Rasool was expelled just two months after he arrived in Washington to serve as his country's envoy.",
      "\"Improving our relationship with the United States of America is a priority for us,\" South Africa's President Cyril Ramaphosa told journalists on Monday, calling the U.S. \"our second largest trading partner after China.\"",
      "\"We have noted the displeasure that has been expressed by the United States, particularly about the remarks he made,\" Ramaphosa said, adding that he expected Rasool to return to Pretoria and \"give me a full report.\"",
      "It's the latest in a string of incidents that have seen a marked deterioration of diplomatic relations between the U.S. and South Africa since Mr. Trump took office for his second term in January.",
      "Speaking on South African television on Saturday, the country's foreign minister said the decision by the U.S. to expel Rasool, who previously campaigned against the country's racist Apartheid regime, was \"unprecedented and regrettable,\" before adding: \"We need to find time to engage with each other behind closed doors, where the U.S. can raise their concerns with us, and we can also raise our concerns with them, because it is not helpful to engage in megaphone and Twitter diplomacy.\"",
      "A pro-Hamas, anti-Israel ambassador to the U.S.?",
      "Rasool's appointment to head the South African diplomatic mission in the U.S., by the ruling African National Congress party, was a contentious one even before he arrived in Washington, dividing opinions within the country's new Government of National Unity (GNU). The ANC had to build the coalition government to maintain power after failing to win a significant enough majority in the last elections to govern on its own.",
      "\"Rasool's appointment was opposed by all of the other political parties in the GNU, and was the first large point of contention between the parties,\" Wiliam Gumede, a professor of public management at Witwatersrand University in Johannesburg, explained to CBS News.",
      "\"Eventually, the non-ANC partners caved in,\" Gumede said, which led to Rasool getting the job.",
      "\"He is perceived to be pro-Iran and Hamas, as well as strongly anti-Israel, which is largely why it was felt he was the wrong choice for the ambassador post,\" Gumede told CBS News.",
      "Rasool has long been a controversial figure in South African politics, having spoken favorably of the U.S.- and Israeli-designated terrorist organization Hamas, and even\u00a0boasting of his ties with the group's leadership. He is a strong backer of the case South Africa filed with the United Nations' top court, accusing Israel of committing genocide in the Gaza Strip. Israel has vehemently rejected that accusation, arguing that its war in the Palestinian enclave has been a legitimate self-defense against Hamas following the group's Oct. 7, 2023 terrorist attack.",
      "Gumede said he believed the way for Ramaphosa to ease the tension with Washington was for the South African president to publicly label Rasool's comments \"unacceptable,\" while also giving a detailed acknowledgement of how important relations and aid from the U.S. are to South Africa.",
      "The analyst said if such measures were not taken by Pretoria to smooth the relationship, the impasse could deepen, with significant implications for South Africa.",
      "\"I fear the next step steps could be targeted economic sanctions against South Africa, which would mean we are in danger of losing 300,000 to 400,000 direct jobs in the country, as well as hundreds of thousands more jobs through indirect channels,\" he said.",
      "\"It's not too late,\" Gumede added. \"President Trump has a lot of South Africans in his inner circle. We need to engage them and put together a team of non-ANC partners from the Government of National Unity to travel to the U.S. and engage the Trump team. The relationship is simply too important not to.\"",

    "story": [
      "While St. Patrick's Day celebrations often produce images of T-shirts donning \"Kiss me, I'm Irish,\" leprechaun hats and pubs full of people, the holiday holds a deeper meaning.",
      "Here's a look at who Ireland's patron saint was and why he is celebrated each year.",
      "When did we start celebrating St. Patrick's Day?",
      "The first historical record of revelry for St. Patrick dates back to the 7th century in Ireland, Sarah Waidler, a visiting assistant professor of Irish language, literature and culture at New York University, told CBS News. However, she said people had likely already begun to honor him before that.",
      "During medieval times, texts show that people not only believed St. Patrick was a saint, but also that he was a part of God's final judgement of Irish people when they died. Over the years, Patrick became \"strongly identified\" with Ireland and would become one of its three patron saints, along with St. Brigid and St. Columba, Waidler said.",
      "The first St. Patrick's Day parade currently on record was held in St. Augustine, Florida, in 1601, historians say. Not, as some might assume, on the Emerald Isle.",
      "\"The parade is an embracing of the Irish diaspora,\" said Elizabeth Stack, the executive director of the American Irish Historical Society in New York City. Especially, she said, in times when there was pushback against Catholics.",
      "Through the parades, the Irish community is saying, \"Yes, we're proud of our heritage and our roots,\" she said, \"but we are also a very vibrant part of a modern city or a modern America.\"",
      "It's also a gentle reminder, she said, that \"there are a lot of us, and if we choose to vote as a block, we can use a lot of power.\"",
      "According to the U.S. Census, 31.5 million Americans, or 9.5% of the population, claimed Irish ancestry in 2021. In 2023, the population of Ireland was 5.3 million. \"There's more of us that left the country then stayed there,\" said Stack.",
      "Who was St. Patrick?",
      "This may come as a surprise to some, but St. Patrick was not actually Irish. \"The patron saint of Ireland is actually a Welshman,\" Cian T. McMahon, an expert on modern Ireland and the Irish diaspora and history professor at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, told CBS News.",
      "\"In the days before there were England, Scotland and Wales, it was Rome,\" he said. So, Patrick was born in what is now Wales, but was then Roman Britain.",
      "Much of what historians know about St. Patrick comes from two of his very own writings, which is considered lucky to have from so long ago, Waidler said. The two pieces were likely written in the 5th century, but Patrick did not date them or give much historical context. So, historians aren't certain of when he lived.",
      "However, according to these writings, Patrick said he was captured when he was 16 years old by slavers from Roman Britain, where he was, in McMahon's words, a \"lukewarm Catholic.\"",
      "The slavers took Patrick to Ireland, where he said he worked as a shepherd. This hardship helped him rediscover his faith, and after 6 years, he escaped to Britain, attributing his release to the works of God. After escaping, he spent many years training to become a bishop, according to his writings.",
      "Waidler said it is hard to say if Patrick was truly recognized as a bishop because there are no other historical texts backing this claim up.",
      "After he supposedly became a bishop, Patrick said that in a vision he heard the voice of an Irish fisherman calling him back to the country he was formerly enslaved in. He then went back to the Celtic Pagan nation of Ireland and converted people to Catholicism.",
      "St. Patrick died on March 17, as recognized by the church. Waidler said it is hard to know the exact year.",
      "Patrick's story, many later writers point out, is very similar to Moses' from the Bible.",
      "After being kidnapped into slavery, he could have been vengeful or looked down on the people who put him in bondage, Stack said. But he decided, instead, to forgive the Irish.",
      "In doing so, she said he \"changed Ireland forever, converting a Pagan country to an intensely Catholic one.\" St. Patrick's \"beautiful message\" of tolerance and forgiveness \"becomes more and more relevant,\" said Stack.",
      "In modern times, many know of the legends that St. Patrick rid Ireland of snakes and that he taught the idea of the holy trinity by using a shamrock.",
      "According to Waidler, the stories attributing the expulsion of poisonous creatures or reptiles to St. Patrick began in the 12th century. However, some later writers see the expulsion of snakes as a metaphor for paganism. \"It is a story that keeps getting repeated after the 12th century and also appears in early images of the saint,\" she said.",
      "\"Shamrocks are harder to trace,\" Waidler said. The term shamrock first appears in 1571, but it was first attributed to St. Patrick in a treatise on Ireland's native plants in 1726. \"Shamrocks, by the way,\" she said, \"are simply clovers.\"",
      "St. Patrick's Day also used to be associated with the color blue. However, as other countries started celebrating it in more modern times, green became associated with the day because Irish-Americans attribute green to \"all things Ireland,\" said Waidler.",
      "Where is St. Patrick's Day celebrated?",
      "\"The better question is where is it not celebrated,\" said McMahon.",
      "Mass migration has been a defining feature of Irish life since the early 1700s, he said. \"Wherever Irish people end up settling, they use St. Patrick's Day as a way to make themselves at home.\"",
      "\"We can be Irish anywhere in the world,\" he said.",
      "Irish people have emigrated to \"every corner of the world,\" said Stack. Dubai, Singapore, Australia, the U.S. and more all celebrate the saint.",
      "\"Irish people made a point of welcoming non-Irish people to St. Patrick's Day,\" McMahon explained.",
      "Even George Washington, an Anglican Christian, was a member of the Friendly Sons of St. Patrick in Philadelphia. The rationale, McMahon said, was, \"We were born Irish but became American ... why can't Washington be born American but become Irish?\"",
      "Ireland's leaders also tend to celebrate St. Patrick's Day in other countries, McMahon said. This, he explained, is because its government recognizes that the day is an opportunity to reconnect with friends and allies around the world.",
      "The Irish Prime Minister, or the Taoiseach, Miche\u00e1l Martin, visited the White House on March 12 to celebrate St. Patrick's Day this year.",
      "According to Ireland's website, \"Our diaspora fosters goodwill. It generates economic development. It cherishes and showcases our diverse and dynamic culture.\"",
      "So, the common phrase \"Everybody's Irish on St. Patrick's Day\" may have some truth to it.",

      "Cancer death rates have dropped 34% between 1991 and 2022, which the ACS attributes to early detection, smoking reduction and improvements in treatment.",
      "While these numbers are encouraging, oncologists and cancer specialists still have concerns about some other factors.",
      "CANCER DEATH RATES DECLINE YET NEW DIAGNOSES SPIKE FOR SOME GROUPS, SAYS REPORT",
      "While the report shows continued progress on many fronts, certain areas remain of \"significant concern,\" Dr. Joshua Strauss, an attending hematologist and medical oncologist at Advanced Care Oncology and Hematology Associates of the Atlantic Medical Group in Morristown, New Jersey, shared with Fox News Digital.",
      "Oncologists share which cancer trends most concern them for 2025. (iStock)",
      "Below are some of the most concerning trends, according to experts.",
      "1. Cancer deaths not improving in younger individuals",
      "Cancer prevalence in younger individuals and adolescents has continued to rise, according to the report, with rates in teens slowly increasing by 0.7% each year.",
      "Cancer is the leading disease-related cause of death among children and adolescents \u2014 most commonly leukemia, brain cancer and lymphoma.",
      "In 2025, the ACS estimates that 9,550 kids up to 14 years old and 5,140 adolescents aged 15 to 19 will be diagnosed with cancer, and that 1,050 children and 600 adolescents will die.",
      "Cancer is the leading disease-related cause of death among children and adolescents, according to ACS. (iStock)",
      "Dr. Paul Oberstein, a gastrointestinal medical oncologist and section chief of GI Medical Oncology at NYU Langone Perlmutter Cancer Center, reiterated that people below age 50 are seeing higher rates of cancer deaths.",
      "\"It\u2019s shown in multiple cancers,\" he told Fox News Digital. \"I would say the biggest finding is in young women with breast cancer.\"",
      "PANCREATIC CANCER PATIENT SURVIVAL DOUBLED WITH HIGH DOSE OF COMMON VITAMIN, STUDY FINDS",
      "The prevalence of GI (gastrointestinal) cancers is also increasing among younger adults, including pancreatic and colon cancer.",
      "Experts have varying hypotheses on why young people are being diagnosed more often, including diet, exposure to microplastics or other environmental triggers, according to Oberstein.",
      "One medical oncologist pushed for more research across patients and institutions to \"figure out what's going on.\" (iStock)",
      "\"We don't have a good explanation, and we need to invest in discovering why this might be the case so that we can change it,\" he said.",
      "2. Cervical cancer continues to pose unnecessary threat",
      "Cervical cancer is one of the few cancers that can be prevented, yet thousands of women are still at risk.",
      "While cervical cancer incidence rates decreased by more than half from the mid-1970s to the mid-2000s due to screening uptake, these numbers have since stabilized, according to the report.",
      "ALCOHOL LINKED TO CANCER RISK IN US SURGEON GENERAL'S NEW ADVISORY",
      "A projected 13,000 women will be diagnosed with cervical cancer in 2025 and 4,000 will die, according to Dr. Jessica Shepherd, a board-certified obstetrician gynecologist in Dallas, Texas.",
      "Cervical cancer risk and rates of mortality correlate to connectivity with a healthcare provider, one expert said. (iStock)",
      "\"Cervical cancer in women from 30 to 44 is increasing,\" she told Fox News Digital. \"But also, this is a cancer that has the potential to be eradicated, if not eliminated, because of us knowing the understanding of HPV and its prevalence in the disease.\"",
      "HPV (human papillomavirus infection), the most common cause of cervical cancer, can be detected through testing.",
      "EXPERIMENTAL VACCINE FOR COMMON CANCER SHOWS POTENTIAL IN CLINICAL TRIAL",
      "\"We have innovation and technology that should be decreasing certain cervical cancer rates,\" Shepherd said.",
      "3. Some communities lack healthcare access",
      "The ACS report found that Native Americans and Black people continue to die at higher rates than White people for several different cancers.",
      "Among cervical cancer patients, the death rate in Black women and Native American women is 50% and 70% higher than in white women.",
      "The five-year relative survival rate for cervical cancer in Black women is 58% compared to 67% of White women, the report found.",
      "Black women are 50% more likely to die from cervical cancer than White women, the report found. (iStock)",
      "This discrepancy in mortality rate is most likely due to lack of access to doctors and regular screenings, added Shepherd, who pushed for more research, awareness and public education.",
      "\"Cervical cancer is preventable through screening with the Pap plus HPV and co-testing,\" she said. \"If we had the ability to have more potential early detection, then we could see abnormalities in cells \u2026 before it actually gets to cancer and could take the time to address it.\"",
      "4. GI cancer diagnoses are worsening",
      "Gastrointestinal (GI) cancers, such as pancreatic, liver, colorectal and stomach cancers, are all considered highly deadly.",
      "The ACS report noted that colorectal diagnoses in men and women under the age of 65 have continued to increase.",
      "Between 2012 and 2021, colorectal cancer incidence rates increased by 2.4% each year in people younger than 50 and by 0.4% per year in adults 50 to 64.",

      "Buettner and his team of demographers and researchers investigated the lifestyle and environmental characteristics in these five areas to determine what people may be doing differently.",
      "\u2018Healthy choice is easy\u2019",
      "\"The big insight we learned from blue zones is that in places where people are actually living longer, it's not because they try,\" Buettner said.",
      "\"In America, we tend to pursue health. We try to identify the right diet or exercise program or supplement regimen \u2014 but our brains are hardwired for novelty.\"",
      "Studies have shown that people who wake up and have a sense of purpose, whether it\u2019s a duty, a passion or an outlet, have greater health outcomes.\u00a0 (iStock)",
      "\"We're constantly bombarded and bamboozled by new health news and people \u2014 and in blue zones, they never tried to live a long time.\"",
      "The reason for this longevity, according to Buettner, is that they live in environments where the healthy choice is easy.",
      "Nutrition and exercise",
      "One of the characteristics most blue zones share is their walkability, as people walk to work, school, friends\u2019 homes or gardens.",
      "\"They're getting 8,000 to 10,000 steps a day without thinking about it,\" Buettner said.",
      "Also, the cheapest and most convenient foods in blue zones are unprocessed.",
      "\"The big insight we learned from blue zones is that in places where people are actually living longer, it's not because they try.\"",
      "\"People in blue zones also eat healthier, as they consume primarily whole, unprocessed, plant-based foods,\" Buettner noted.",
      "The average American eats about 220 pounds of meat a year, which he believes is \"too much.\"",
      "\"I'm not advocating a no-meat diet, but I will tell you, people in blue zones eat about 20 pounds of meat a year, so about once a week as a celebratory food \u2014 and they are getting all the nutrients they need.\"",

      "People also eat far more fiber in these areas, Buettner found.",
      "\"In blue zones, the cheapest and most accessible foods were full fiber,\" he said. \"They pull them out of their garden \u2026 whole grains or beans are the cornerstone of every longevity diet in the world.\"",
      "FRESH FOOD CONSUMPTION COULD HELP SOLVE DIET-RELATED ILLNESS: EXPERTS",
      "Fiber is often neglected in the American diet, Buettner said, with only about 5% to 10% of Americans getting enough.",
      "\"If you don't get enough fiber, it often goes to work at the mucous membrane and creates a certain permeability or leaky gut, and that causes all kinds of problems,\" he warned.",
      "Passion and purpose",
      "Studies have shown that people who wake up and have a sense of purpose, whether it\u2019s a duty, a passion or an outlet, have greater health outcomes.",
      "\"The blue zone purpose almost always includes an altruistic dimension,\" Buettner shared.",
      "\"There's almost always doing it for the next generation, or for the community or their church. There's always some philanthropic dimension to their purpose.\"",
      "Power of community",
      "\"In blue zones, we see very clearly that people are connecting face to face, probably five to six hours a day,\" Buettner said.",
      "People in these areas often live in extended families.",
      "\"People in blue zones eat healthier, as they consume primarily whole, unprocessed, plant-based foods.\" (iStock)",
      "\"Grandma never gets lonely, because she lives upstairs and helps with the garden,\" Buettner shared as an example. \"She helps cook food and she helps with childcare. And the kids do better because they're getting better attention. And it's this virtuous circle.\"",
      "In blue zones, people typically live in communities where they care about each other, he added.",
      "\"They're not spending nearly as many stress hormones arguing about things \u2014 and there's more time for laughter when you're not angry.\"",
      "Faith factor",
      "Data shows that people who regularly go to church live anywhere from four to 14 years longer than people who don't, Buettner noted.",
      "\"You can't measure faith, but you can measure religiosity,\" he said. \"Scientists simply ask people how often they show up at church, temple or mosque, and then they compare the longevity of the people who show up to those who don't show up at all.\"",
      "WARDING OFF DEMENTIA MEANS MORE READING, PRAYING AND LISTENING TO MUSIC: STUDY",
      "Part of this likely stems from the fact that churchgoers have a built-in community, he said, as loneliness has proven to be \"toxic.\"",

      "Those who worship on Sunday may also benefit from having one day a week where they \"stop everything.\"",
      "\"Being human is inherently stressful, and church gives us an hour or maybe a couple of hours where we fully take the focus off of our everyday life and troubles, and we get to sort of elevate to a higher plane and focus on a greater good,\" Buettner said.",

      "The act of prayer itself could also \"stack the deck\" in favor of longevity and health, he added.",
      "\"By the way, people who sing in the choir actually even live longer,\" Beuttner said. \"So if you want a little extra bump, join the church and sing in the choir.\"",
      "Sleep's role in health",
      "In his visits to blue zones, Buettner found that the residents are usually early to bed, early to rise.",
      "\"They have kind of two sleeps, where they'll go to bed shortly after sunset, and then get up at 3 or 4 a.m. and do some chores, and then go back to sleep until sunrise,\" he told Fox News Digital.",

      "\"And some good research shows that people who take a 20-minute nap five days a week have significantly lower rates of cardiovascular disease and about 30% lower rates of cardiovascular mortality,\" Buettner said. \"So napping is definitely part of the blue zone approach to longevity.\"",
      "\"Blue zones give us a very clear set of choices and environmental factors that would help us mindlessly get the years we deserve.\"",
      "Overall, he concluded, anyone can benefit from the lessons learned from the blue zones \u2014 primarily the importance of keeping people healthy in the first place.",
      "\"It\u2019s about shaping their environment so that healthier choices are easier or unavoidable and setting them up for success, so they're subconsciously making better decisions on a day-to-day basis for years or decades,\" Buettner said.",

      "He said many parents became aware of the issue when they discovered that schools were socially transitioning children, sometimes as young as fifth grade, without notifying parents.

      "In other words, some Democrats believed the interim spending bill was an inflection point. They might not be able to stop President Trump and Congressional Republicans from approving the \"big, beautiful bill\" to slash spending and cut taxes. But they could have shuttered the government by filibustering the spending plan because it failed to reflect any major Democratic priorities. They needed to stand up.",
      "\"Leader Schumer has been very effective in a lot of battles. But these are new times,\" said Heinrich. \"Second guessing Leader Schumer out here isn't going to accomplish the kind of unity that we're going to need to be able to stand up the President. So we'll have that conversation inside the caucus.\"",
      "The Senate is out until next week now. That might cool some of the tensions. But it also may exacerbate them. Schumer was supposed to go on a tour this week, promoting his book \"Antisemitism in America.\" Appearances in Baltimore and Washington are now canceled \"due to security concerns.\"",
      "Regardless, it\u2019s possible that dissonance about Schumer\u2019s leadership may have overshadowed anything he could say about antisemitism in his forthcoming book.",

He or she is the Constitutional officer of the legislative branch of government. In the Senate, the positions of Majority and Minority Leader are determined by their respective party caucuses or conferences \u2013 behind closed doors. Therefore, there\u2019s no \"motion to vacate the chair\" like in the House. The real power of the Majority Leader stems from the custom of the Senate recognizing the Majority Leader first \u2013 ahead of the 99 others.",
      "The Senate has only removed one party leader in recent memory. And that wasn\u2019t even done formally on the floor. The administration of President George W.

      "A federal judge set a noon Tuesday deadline for the Trump administration to submit detailed information about the deportation flight, or flights, it conducted over the weekend that sent Venezuelan nationals to El Salvador, amid questions over whether the administration knowingly defied an earlier court order to halt any planned removals of Venezuelan migrants for a period of 14 days.",
      "During a fact-finding hearing Monday evening, U.S. District Judge James Boasberg ordered the Trump administration to submit more information on the flight, which transported hundreds of migrants to El Salvador, including Venezuelan nationals targeted for removal under the 1798 wartime-era Alien Enemies Act. Judge Boasberg had granted an emergency order to temporarily block the flights from taking place for 14 days while the court considered the legality of using wartime immigration law to immediately deport Venezuelan nationals and alleged members of the violent gang Tren de Aragua.",
      "During Monday's hearing, which lasted about 45 minutes, Judge Boasberg asked the government lawyers to submit information on how planes departed the U.S. on Saturday that were carrying any people who were deported \"solely on the basis\" of that proclamation, how many individuals were on each plane, where the planes landed and what time each plane took off from the U.S., and from where.",

      "Boasberg at times appeared frustrated as he pressed government lawyers for more details as to why his Saturday order \u2013 which called for the administration to immediately return all planes with expelled migrants, including the Venezuelan nationals and alleged Tren de Aragua gang members \u2013 was not enforced.",
      "\"My orders don\u2019t seem to carry much weight,\" Judge Boasberg said near the end of the hearing.

      "Not answering unfamiliar calls is one of the best ways to avoid a potential scam. Most phone carriers now label robocalls as \"Spam Risk\" or something similar. Scammers often use your local area code or even parts of your phone number to make you think the call is legitimate. That's why it's crucial to carefully check the number before picking up. If you don\u2019t recognize the number, it\u2019s safest to ignore the call or text in case it's spam.",

      "Unfortunately, there\u2019s a high chance that your phone number is readily available on many lists that data brokers sell to numerous search websites. However, removing your number from these sites can help lower the chances of spammers getting a hold of it and reaching out to you. With a data removal service, your personal information is removed from the web so data brokers and scammers never get their hands on your personal phone number, home address or email address. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",

      "This kind of fraud involves a scammer impersonating you to request a change of address with the United States Postal Service (USPS).",
      "Once they have your mail redirected to an address they control, they can go through it at their leisure, looking for mail they can steal and information they can use to perpetrate further scams, like taking out loans or credit cards in your name or using your identity to defraud others.",

      "This detailed breakdown explains the process of a change-of-address scam, from initial targeting to the potential consequences and warning signs to watch for.",
      "A person with criminal intent gets your postal address and full name, something that\u2019s most easily done using a so-called people search site. People search sites, also known as people finder sites, are a kind of data broker that specializes in collecting, organizing and selling access to personal information.",
      "The scammer then mails a change-of-address request to the USPS, providing your name and a new address he has access to. The\u00a0online change-of-address form is generally more secure, requiring confirmation via a bank account. That\u2019s why scammers will almost always mail in the request.",
      "The form requires a signature, but this is unlikely to be verified when processing the request. So, the scammer will either find an image of your signature somewhere, steal a document that includes your signature or simply sign your name any which way.",
      "Now that they\u2019ve redirected your mail straight into their hands, the scammer just has to patiently wait for sensitive mail to arrive.

This will dramatically reduce the amount of sensitive mail heading to your mailbox, leaving criminals with little value to steal. Check your mail daily, as soon as possible after it\u2019s delivered. Get someone to do this for you if you\u2019re away. Some redirection scams start with mail being stolen from your mailbox. Definitely avoid allowing your mailbox to overflow.",

      "There are concerns about how the technology might affect personal space and data security.",
      "The trucking industry is in the midst of a technological revolution, thanks to the arrival of artificial intelligence-powered dashcams.",
      "These innovative devices promise to make roads safer and operations more efficient, but they also raise some important questions about privacy.",
      "For truck drivers, other motorists and even pedestrians, there are valid concerns about how this technology might affect their personal space and data security.",

      "AI dashcam system\u00a0 (Motive)",
      "The promise of AI dashcams",
      "AI dashcams are transforming road safety and fleet management through advanced computer vision technology. These smart devices, equipped with both inward- and outward-facing cameras, can detect a wide range of unsafe driving behaviors.",
      "The outward-facing cameras are capable of detecting rolling stops, unsafe lane changes and potential collisions, while the inward-facing cameras monitor driver drowsiness, distraction, seatbelt violations and smoking. The accuracy of these systems is impressive, with detection rates ranging from 88% to 99.5% and false positives as low as 0.5% to 12%.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "FusionSite Services, a waste management provider, installed\u00a0Motive's AI dashcam system across their 800-unit fleet, resulting in a significant reduction in accidents and unsafe behaviors. Specifically, it saw an 89% decrease in accidents and a 92% decrease in unsafe behaviors, highlighting the tangible impact of this technology on safety.",

      "BIG RIGS DELIVER CARGO WITH NO HUMANS AT THE WHEEL",
      "Privacy concerns",
      "Despite the safety benefits, the installation of AI dashcams raises significant privacy issues. Many truck drivers view their vehicles as second homes, especially long-haul drivers who spend extended periods on the road. The constant presence of cameras in their workspace raises concerns about perceived invasion of privacy in personal space, fear of constant surveillance and micromanagement and worries about data security and potential misuse of collected information.",
      "The use of outward-facing cameras also affects the privacy of other road users because they may record private citizens without consent. There is a risk of data breaches exposing personal information or location data and concerns about how footage might be used or shared. These concerns underscore the need for careful consideration of privacy rights when deploying such technology.",
      "To address some of these privacy concerns, Motive has implemented features such as Driver Privacy Mode, which allows drivers to disable the driver-facing camera while off duty. Additionally, Motive's AI dashcam system includes privacy controls and the option to activate Driver Privacy Mode for individual drivers, groups or entire fleets. Motive's AI dash cam also incorporates blurring technology to protect the privacy of individuals captured in the footage, further addressing concerns about recording private citizens without consent.",

      "The implementation of AI dashcams must navigate a complex landscape of legal and ethical considerations. In some jurisdictions, like California, the use of such cameras is not considered a violation of state laws. However, in Illinois, a lawsuit has been filed against Samsara, alleging violations of the Biometric Information Privacy Act (BIPA) for capturing and storing drivers' facial scans without proper consent. This highlights the importance of understanding and complying with local regulations when using AI dashcams.",

      "Balancing safety and privacy",
      "To address privacy concerns while maintaining safety benefits, companies should develop clear policies on camera usage and data access. Cameras should only record during specific events rather than continuously, and robust data security measures must be established to prevent breaches and misuse.",
      "Providing comprehensive training to drivers on the purpose and benefits of the technology is also crucial. Open communication and trust between management and drivers are essential for fostering a positive environment where both safety and privacy are respected.",
      "As reported by\u00a0The Trucker, an authority on all things in the trucking and freight industry, \"Truck drivers are not much different than the rest of us in our desire to adapt to technological advances. At first, they don't want to, and some may go as far as getting out of the business. Eventually, like many of us, once we do adapt to the changing landscape, it soon becomes second nature.\u00a0However, a driver-facing camera may be too much of an invasion of personal privacy.\"",

However, the implementation of these systems must be carefully balanced against privacy concerns. As the technology continues to evolve, it is crucial for companies, policymakers and drivers to work together to establish guidelines that protect individual privacy while harnessing the safety potential of AI dashcams.

      "IOS 18.3.2 software update on iPhone (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What is CVE-2025-24201?",
      "This vulnerability resides in WebKit, the open-source browser engine that powers Safari, Mail, App Store and other apps on Apple devices.

These attacks are believed to involve well-funded threat actors, such as state-sponsored hackers or advanced cybercriminal groups.",
      "Why does this matter?",
      "Zero-day vulnerabilities like CVE-2025-24201 are particularly dangerous because they are exploited before developers can patch them.

      "Kurt the CyberGuy explains how to increase your security and privacy through Google Chrome on your devices when browsing the web.",
      "Chrome extensions are incredibly useful, whether you want to block ads, track the best deals or\u00a0enhance your browsing experience. They can be downloaded from the Chrome Web Store, which functions like the Play Store but for extensions. However, extensions are easier to mimic and turn into malicious software compared to apps.",
      "As we just reported, over 3.2 million users were victimized by a security breach tied to\u00a016 malicious browser extensions, highlighting how attackers exploit tools that seem legitimate to spread malware or steal sensitive data.",
      "Now, security researchers have discovered a polymorphic attack that allows malicious Chrome extensions to transform into other browser extensions, including password managers, crypto wallets and banking apps, to steal sensitive information.",
      "Keep reading to learn how this attack works and how to protect yourself from it.",

      "Chrome browser on smartphone (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How the malicious polymorphic attack works",
      "Security researchers at\u00a0SquareX Labs have found a new attack that lets malicious Chrome extensions disguise themselves as legitimate ones, like password managers, crypto wallets and banking apps, to steal sensitive information. This \"polymorphic\" attack takes advantage of Chrome\u2019s extension system to trick users while staying under the radar.",
      "The attack starts with hackers uploading what looks like a harmless extension to the Chrome Web Store. It might even have real features, like an AI-powered marketing tool, to convince users to install and pin it to their browser.",
      "Once installed, the malicious extension scans the victim\u2019s browser for other extensions. It can do this in two ways. If it has permission to use the \"chrome.management\" API, it grabs a list of installed extensions directly. If not, it injects code into web pages to check for unique files or resources tied to certain extensions.",
      "If it finds a targeted extension, like 1Password, the malicious extension reports back to an attacker-controlled server. The attacker then tells it to impersonate the real extension by disabling it if permissions allow, changing its name and icon and displaying a fake login popup that looks just like the real thing.",
      "Fake extension page (SquareX)",
      "THE HIDDEN COSTS OF FREE APPS: YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION",
      "Social engineering makes things worse",
      "To steal user credentials, the malicious extension triggers a fake \"Session Expired\" prompt when the victim tries to log in to a website. This tricks them into thinking they need to reenter their credentials for their password manager or banking app. When they do, the stolen data is sent straight to the attackers.",
      "After collecting the credentials, the extension switches back to its original form. It restores the legitimate extension, making everything look normal so the victim doesn\u2019t suspect anything. This shows just how dangerous malicious Chrome extensions can be and why stronger security measures are needed to protect users.",
      "We reached out to Google, and a spokesperson told CyberGuy,\u00a0\"We appreciate the work of the research community and we've received the report. We are constantly investing in ways to improve the security of the Chrome Web Store, and we take appropriate action when we learn of emerging threats.\"",

      "5 ways you can protect your personal data",
      "Here are five ways to safeguard your sensitive information and maintain your online privacy.",
      "1.\u00a0Keep your browser and extensions up to date: Outdated software is a goldmine for cybercriminals. Bugs or security gaps in old versions of your browser or extensions can be exploited to inject malicious code, steal data or take control of your system. Updates patch these vulnerabilities, making them a critical line of defense. Turn on automatic updates for your browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge) so you\u2019re always running the latest version without thinking about it. See my guide on\u00a0keeping your devices and apps updated for more information.",
      "2. Install extensions only from trusted sources:\u00a0Official browser stores like the Chrome Web Store or Firefox Add-ons have rules and scans to catch bad actors, but they\u2019re not perfect. Extensions from random websites or third-party downloads are far more likely to hide malware or spyware. Stick to the official store for your browser; don\u2019t download extensions from sketchy links.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "3. Have strong antivirus software:\u00a0The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "4. Update your passwords: Change passwords for any accounts that may have been affected by the extension and use unique, strong passwords for each account. Consider using a password manager. This can help you generate and store strong, unique passwords for all your accounts. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 here.",
      "5.\u00a0Invest in personal data removal services: If your personal data gets stolen by the extension, it\u2019s crucial to act quickly to reduce your risk of identity theft and scams. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",

      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "The malicious extension highlights that Google isn\u2019t doing enough to keep malware off its platform. Security researchers pointed out that the Chrome Web Store lacks protections against these types of attacks, such as blocking sudden changes to an extension\u2019s icon or HTML, or at least alerting users when such changes occur. The problem isn\u2019t limited to the Chrome Web Store. The Play Store also hosts malicious apps from time to time, affecting millions of users.

      "3. Enable transaction alerts and spending limits:\u00a0Set up real-time alerts for transactions and daily spending limits on your cards. This way, you\u2019ll be notified immediately of any unauthorized activity.",
      "4. Never store card details in browsers:\u00a0Infostealers target autofill data in Chrome, Edge and Firefox. Always deny the pop-up that asks to \"save payment info\" and use a secure password manager instead. You may also want to take advantage of additional digital security measures such as\u00a0two-factor authentication. Newer types of authentication, such as Face ID and Touch ID, are slowly replacing passwords as a legitimate means to grant a person access to sensitive financial information.",
      "5. Be smart about passwords: Simply employing all the password rules won\u2019t prevent a breach, but since you don\u2019t know exactly what information thieves are looking for, it can\u2019t hurt. You should use strong passwords and change them frequently. I recommend using a password manager to generate and store strong passwords.

The Houthis, an Iranian proxy, have dragged Yemen into chaos, destabilized the region, and attacked global shipping.

The Houthis have disrupted global trade, attacked U.S. forces and fueled instability. That said, it\u2019s unclear how far the U.S. is willing to go in its campaign against them. The Red Sea and the Strait of Mandab are among the most strategic trade routes in the world, carrying over 20% of oil shipments and 13% of global trade.\"",

      "EXCLUSIVE: After surviving nearly a year and a half deep underground, with barely enough air to breathe and no light, and sharing an 18-square-foot space with three other men, recently released hostage Tal Shoham shared with Fox News Digital his harrowing story of captivity at the hands of Hamas.",
      "Shoham was forcibly taken from Kibbutz Be\u2019eri on\u00a0October 7, 2023. His wife and children, ages four and eight, were also kidnapped that day, but he didn\u2019t know that when he was thrown into the trunk of a car and driven into Gaza by Hamas terrorists. He didn\u2019t even know whether his family was alive; hoping to save them, he surrendered to the terrorists just before they set fire to the house where his family was hiding.",
      "He would spend the eight-and-a-half months in an underground tunnel and another five months captive in five different houses deep inside Gaza, where his captors kept him shackled, starved him and deprived him of basic human comforts.",

      "But he gave himself a mission: He was determined not to lose his humanity. Even in moments when he feared that he was facing death, he tried to stay focused. \"I am not a victim. Even if this ends, I will end it with my head high, looking death in the eyes. They won\u2019t break me, and I will not surrender to self-pity. We are stronger than the other side,\" he said.",
      "It has been three weeks since he came home, and he is ready to speak. Kibbutz Be\u2019eri is just nine kilometers \u2014 about five-and-a-half miles \u2014\u00a0from Gaza, but that short distance is practically an ocean between what he describes as two worlds. \"Half-an-hour\u2019s drive, two separate worlds,\" he said. \"The first \u2014 unbelievably surreal, cruel beyond reason. And just 30 minutes away [on this side of the border], a world of sanity, logic, dignity and compassion.\"",
      "He remembers every detail of his 505 days in captivity. Tal wants to tell his story for the sake of the two fellow captives\u00a0who remain behind, starving, abused and at constant risk of death. \"Just as someone emerges from a womb alive, I emerged from the tunnel I was held in and was born again,\" he says. But the men he calls his \"brothers,\" Evyatar David and Guy Gilboa-Dalal, are still held underground. \"I can\u2019t sleep at night knowing they are still there,\" he says.",

      "Tal and his wife and children had come from the north of Israel to Kibbutz Be\u2019eri to spend the Simchat Torah holiday with his wife\u2019s parents and were in the home when the terror attack began. He said everyone entered the safe room, and as the sounds of gunfire drew closer, they tried to barricade themselves inside. But the terrorists pried open the window, and Tal feared they might toss in a grenade if the family did not surrender. On the same street, the terrorists set fire to every other home, burning the people inside alive.",
      "\"I went out and raised my hands,\" he said. \"A man with murder in his eyes led me onto the road and to a vehicle. I saw about 40 heavily armed terrorists. Some of them were filming me on their phones. I was in shock \u2014 there was an entire battalion of Hamas terrorists inside our kibbutz, bodies of people I knew who were murdered on the ground, and they are laughing, unafraid.\"",

      "The terrorists threw him into the trunk of a car and drove him across the border, into Gaza. There, a crowd gathered. \"Teenagers with sticks ran toward me, trying to beat me from all sides,\" he says. Taking him from the car, his captors pointed a rifle at him, ready, he believed, to execute him, and tried to force him to kneel. \"I said, \u2018I can\u2019t control whether you kill me or not,\u2019 and I raised my hands \u2014 but I refused to kneel. \u2018If you want to kill me, kill me, but you will not execute me like ISIS.\u2019\"",
      "He was then paraded through the streets in what he described as a \"victory march.\" \"They were shouting, \u2018Soldier! Pig! Zionist!\u2019 A mob gathered around, boys with wooden clubs trying to hit me. But I just waved and smiled. I didn\u2019t show fear. \u2018You\u2019ve captured me, but you won\u2019t see terror in my eyes.\u2019\"",
      "He was first taken to the home of a family, where he was held, alone and always shackled, for 34 days. Though he was allowed to periodically shower, the captivity was otherwise severe.",
      "His food was strictly rationed. \"For the first three days, I had pita bread. Then, they stopped giving me that,\" he says. \"Food supplies dwindled. Some days, I would receive three spoons of avocado and three dates, or half an orange from a tree in the yard.\"",
      "But the worst torment was not knowing whether his family was alive. \"I am 40 years old. Never in my life have I experienced suffering like this. The isolation, being alone with relentless thoughts \u2014that was worse than even extreme hunger.\"",
      "To endure, he made a heartbreaking decision. \"I had to accept that my family was dead,\" Tal says. \"I sat on the floor and imagined myself at their funeral. I stood in front of a grave \u2014 one large for my wife, and two small for my children \u2014 and I eulogized each of them. I thanked them for the time we had. I told them to move on. I sobbed but didn\u2019t let my captors see me cry. That was the hardest thing I\u2019ve ever done \u2014 burying my family in my mind.\"",

      "On the 34th day of his captivity, Evyatar David and Guy Gilboa-Dalal were brought to the home. The Hamas terrorists tortured them daily, hitting them, denying them food while eating in front of them. The hostages were allowed only about 300 calories a day \u2014 Shoham's weight dropped from 174 pounds to 110 pounds when he was released \u2014 and speaking was forbidden. \"We couldn\u2019t move from our beds or talk. We whispered everything,\" he said.",
      "Then came some glimmer of hope. On the 50th day of his captivity, Tal received proof of life from his wife \u2014 a letter telling him she and the children had been held hostage but were being released. \"I read it, my hands shaking,\" he said. \"The most important thing had happened \u2014 my family was safe. I didn\u2019t need to be a father and husband protecting them anymore. Now, I could focus on my war, the one I knew how to fight, the one for survival.\"",

      "The Tunnel",
      "By June 2024, Tal, Guy and Evyatar were moved by an ambulance\u00a0that Hamas used\u00a0for discreetly transporting hostages, to an underground tunnel, where there already was another captive, Omer Wenkert. There were four mattresses on the floor and a hole in the ground for a toilet. The space was illuminated by a single, dim lightbulb. \"It took me weeks to stop feeling like the walls were closing in, to adapt to the oxygen deprivation,\" Tal says.",
      "They were given just 300 milliliters of water a day \u2014 a little more than 10 ounces. They could use it to either drink or wash their hands. Rice was all they had to eat. Months passed. They were beaten, monitored by cameras, randomly deprived of food and sleep. The guards were Hamas tunnel diggers \u2014 digging every day, even as war raged above. \"Hamas never stopped digging tunnels,\" Tal Says. \"Not for a single day.\"",
      "The conditions were so bad that both he and Evyatar developed severe infections. But it would be months before a doctor would come to see them. \"My leg turned blue, yellow, and purple with internal bleeding,\" He recalls. \"They gave us all blood thinners, fearing we might develop clots from prolonged immobility. Eventually, they realized the issue was malnutrition and provided us with vitamin supplements for seven days. It tasted like dog food, but it dramatically improved our condition.\"",
      "ISRAEL SAYS HAMAS SENT A TODDLER TO A MILITARY OUTPOST",
      "Guy Gilboa-Dalal is still being held in Gaza by Hamas terrorists. \u00a0 (Courtesy: Bring Them Home Now)",
      "But the abuse continued. A new guard arrived, even more violent than the previous ones. \"He made some of us kneel like dogs and beat us,\" he says. \"He would come in screaming that we were filthy Jews, hit us, and then 10 minutes later, he would smile and bring food.\"",
      "Then, what seemed like a miracle. Tal and Omer were named as part of the\u00a0hostage-release deal\u00a0in February. When he was led outside after many months underground, still blindfolded, he felt moisture on his face. \"Is it rain?\" he asked. \"No,\" his captors responded, \"\u2019It is dew.\u2019 And I realized, my name, Tal, is \u2018dew\u2019 in Hebrew. I felt the morning dew on my skin.\"",
      "There were humiliations to come before he was handed over to the Red Cross and returned to Israel: a procession on a stage in the heart of Rafah where he was forced to repeat Hamas propaganda.\u00a0 But he said he didn\u2019t care \u2014 he was going home. When he arrived in Israel, he was taken to the Re\u2019im base, where his wife, Adi, and their two children, Nave and Yahel, were waiting for him. \"It was a dream come true, yet it still felt like a dream,\" Tal says. \"It took a few days to fully grasp that it was real. It was hard to take in. The emotions flooded me, like I was floating above everything.\"",
      "And there was tragic news to absorb. Eleven members of Tal\u2019s family were kidnapped or murdered on October 7. Adi\u2019s father, Avshalom Haran, and two uncles, Lilach and Evyatar Kipnis, were killed. His mother-in-law, Shoshan Haran, was taken, along with two other relatives \u2014 Sharon Avigdori and her daughter, Noam Avigdori \u2014 who were later released in the first hostage deal. Two other relatives who had come from the United States to celebrate a birthday, 59-year-old Judith Raanan, and her 17-year-old daughter, Natalie, were also kidnapped from Kibbutz Nahal Oz.",

The terrorists brought in whatever horrors they wanted, inflicted whatever cruelty and pain they could, imposed their inhumanity on us. But within our space, we preserved our inner cleanliness, our humanity between one another. And that was crucial to making it out unbroken.\"",

    "story": [
      "For some hoops fans, the NCAA men\u2019s basketball tournament is about school spirit, shocking upsets, Cinderella runs, the office bracket contest, mid-majors with funny mascots or a myriad of other happenstances that make March Madness popular.",

      "First game: Friday at 2:50 p.m. ET, opponent TBD",
      "Whether your favorite NBA team blatantly tanked (the Washington Wizards) or hilariously fell apart and slid into the lottery despite lofty preseason expectations (the Philadelphia 76ers), the most important team to keep an eye on in the tourney are the Blue Devils. If you can put aside your disgust of Duke for a moment, the Blue Devils are projected by many draft experts to have three players selected in the top-10 of the upcoming NBA draft.",
      "By now, you probably know about Cooper Flagg, the forward who is the presumptive No. 1 pick this June. Flagg was the No. 1 recruit in the high school class of 2024, and last summer he earned an invite to practice against the U.S. men\u2019s Olympic\u00a0squad\u00a0as part of the Select Team. He averaged 18.9 points, 7.5 rebounds and 4.1 assists a contest as a freshman.",
      "The other names to know are forward Kon Knueppel, a shot-making forward whose 3-point prowess makes him attractive to pretty much any team, and Khaman Maluach, a center who can offer teams a potential defensive anchor and rim runner at the next level.",
      "Team you wish you could watch: Rutgers Scarlet Knights",
      "No team epitomizes the dichotomy of the college and NBA games better than the Scarlet Knights. Rutgers is expected to have two players \u2014 guard Dylan Harper and forward Ace Bailey \u2014 selected in the lottery.",

      "Guard Kasparas Jakucionis and forward Will Riley are both possible first-round selections. Jakucionis has a chance to go in the top 10, while Riley is most often projected as going final third of the first.",
      "Bleacher Report\u2019s Jonathan Wasserman describes Jakucionis as a Chauncey Billups-type guard who can thrive off the ball. Meanwhile, ESPN bills Riley as a player whose size on the wing could be an asset, though he still has room for improvement as a shooter.",
      "Player who could shoot his way into your heart: Tre Johnson",
      "First game: Wednesday at 9:10 p.m. ET vs. Xavier",
      "Texas Longhorns guard Tre Johnson is an unapologetic scorer who seems to have emerged as the fifth-best player in the upcoming draft class. Nearly every mock has a consensus top four in Flagg, Harper, Bailey and the Baylor Bears\u2019 V.J. Edgecombe. Johnson is the player who most often pops up after them.",
      "Johnson is a gunner who is not afraid to let it fly. He can create for himself on the perimeter and seems to have NBA-ready scoring talent.",
      "The Longhorns are no guarantee to make a tournament run, however. Texas will play in the First Four for an opportunity to make the 64-team field. A big night from Johnson could give him a March bump.",

      "The order and the subsequent appeal could have major implications for the future legal treatment of AI-generated child sexual abuse material, or CSAM, which has been a top concern among child safety advocates and has become a subject of at least two prosecutions in the last year. If higher courts uphold the decision, it could cut prosecutors off from successfully charging some people with the private possession of AI-generated CSAM.",
      "The case centers on Steven Anderegg, 42, of Holmen, Wisconsin, whom the Justice Department charged in May with \u201cproducing, distributing, and possessing obscene visual depictions of minors engaged in sexually explicit conduct and transferring obscene material to a minor under the age of 16.\u201d",
      "Prosecutors alleged that he used an AI image generator called Stable Diffusion to create over 13,000 images depicting child sexual abuse by entering text prompts into the technology that then generated fake images depicting non-real children. (Some AI systems are also used to create explicit images of known people, but prosecutors do not claim that is what Anderegg was doing.)",
      "In February, in response to Anderegg\u2019s motion to dismiss the charges, U.S. District Judge James D. Peterson allowed three of the charges to move forward but threw one out, saying the First Amendment protects the possession of \u201cvirtual child pornography\u201d in one\u2019s home. On March 3, prosecutors appealed.",
      "In the decision, Peterson denied Anderegg\u2019s request to dismiss charges of distribution of an obscene image of a minor, transfer of obscene matter to a person under 16 and production of an image of a minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct.",
      "Anderegg\u2019s lawyer did not respond to a request for comment. The Justice Department declined to comment.",
      "Many AI platforms have tried to prevent their tools from being used in creating such content, but some safety guardrails can easily be modified or removed, and a July study from the Internet Watch Foundation found that the amount of AI-generated CSAM posted online is increasing.",
      "The Justice Department alleged in a news release in May that Anderegg described his image-making process in a chat with a 15-year-old boy and sent the images to the teenager. Law enforcement was alerted to Anderegg after Instagram reported his account to the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children, the release said.",
      "The Justice Department has argued that the 2003 Protect Act, while not specifically referring to it, criminalizes AI-generated CSAM by banning \u201cobscene visual representations of the sexual abuse of children.\u201d",
      "Peterson referred to a 1969 Supreme Court ruling, Stanley v. Georgia, which said private possession of obscene material in one\u2019s own home cannot be made a crime.",
      "That ruling has not traditionally been applied to cases involving CSAM that includes real children, which have typically been tried under a different set of laws about the sexual exploitation of minors, such as banning the transport or sale of CSAM."

    "summary": "The Trump administration says the group should be treated as an invading force. Critics say it\u2019s a pretext for the administration\u2019s anti-immigrant narrative.",
    "story": [
      "AURORA, Colo. \u2014 At the center of an increasingly fraught political and legal battle led by President Donald Trump is a Venezuelan gang, Tren de Aragua \u2014 to some an organized and violent menace threatening U.S. national security, and to others the administration\u2019s pretext for its anti-migrant narrative and mass deportation efforts.",
      "This weekend, Trump claimed the gang was invading the United States and invoked the Alien Enemies Act, a rarely used law from 1738 that allows the president to deport noncitizens during wartime. The administration sent hundreds of immigrants to a prison in El Salvador even as a federal judge temporarily barred the deportations. Flights were already in the air when the ruling came down. At a federal court hearing in the case Monday, U.S. District Judge James Boasberg summarized the administration\u2019s position on his court order Saturday as: \u201cWe don\u2019t care, we\u2019ll do what we want.\u201d",
      "Trump and his supporters have sought to portray the gang as the embodiment of the criminal immigrant they so often conjure to explain the president\u2019s increasingly aggressive immigration enforcement, which has also included sending hundreds of Venezuelan migrants to the U.S. naval base in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and stripping hundreds of thousands more of temporary legal status in the U.S.",
      "The reality is more complicated.",
      "Origins in prison",
      "Tren de Aragua began in the 2000s in a notorious penitentiary in north-central Venezuela, where gang leaders at one point had their own zoo, nightclub and bank inside the prison. What distinguishes the gang from other, larger criminal organizations is the quickness and ease with which it has spread over a large portion of the American continent, a movement experts say is tied to the mass exodus of Venezuelans.",
      "According to the U.N., roughly 7.7 million Venezuelans have left their homeland in the last decade, more than a quarter of the population and almost certainly an undercount. It\u2019s the largest mass displacement in the history of the Americas and one of the largest in the modern era anywhere in the world, by some estimates outpacing even the Syrian refugee crisis. Roughly three-quarters of a million people have arrived in the U.S. from Venezuela since 2022.",
      "The massive and yearslong flow out of Venezuela and into the surrounding region provided the gang with an easy way to grow. Its signature enterprise is a model of sex trafficking that uses migration as a coercive weapon.",
      "The gang facilitates a woman\u2019s travel out of Venezuela, and when she reaches her destination, it forces her into prostitution to pay down the often insurmountable debt. Tren de Aragua developed this model in Colombia starting in 2018 and now practices it in several countries, including, according to federal prosecutors, the United States.",
      "In the U.S., law enforcement has accused dozens of people of belonging to Tren de Aragua in at least 14 states, according to an NBC News analysis. The crimes include sex trafficking in Nashville, Tennessee; ATM theft in New York; a contract killing in Miami; and low-level arms dealing in Denver. Six states \u2014 Colorado, Florida, Illinois, New York, Texas and Virginia \u2014 have what police have identified as the most organized presence, with enterprises that mirror their Latin American operations.",
      "But Tren de Aragua is dwarfed in both size and organization by more established criminal syndicates both foreign and homegrown. It\u2019s often unclear how law enforcement identifies gang members, and evidence of their involvement is tenuous in some of the most violent and high-profile cases that Trump and his supporters attribute to the gang. This has prompted advocates to suggest the specter of violence is being used as a pretext for violating civil rights.",
      "Caught in the middle are law-abiding Venezuelans. They are, according to law enforcement, the most frequent targets of gang violence. They are also in the crosshairs of Trump\u2019s immigration crackdown.",
      "Aurora, Colorado",
      "In recent years, Denver and surrounding cities like Aurora became a major destination for Venezuelans arriving in the U.S. The city barely had a Venezuelan diaspora before then: Jeanette Rodriguez, who moved to the area when she was 18 years old, said that for nearly three decades she could count the number of fellow Venezuelans she knew on one hand.",
      "\u201cThat changed about 2 1/2 years ago,\u201d she said.",
      "Rodriguez \u2014 a pastor at her church, a community leader and a deputy with the Arapahoe County Sheriff\u2019s Office \u2014 said she was glad to suddenly see so many of her people at church or selling arepas on the street.",
      "But she was also apprehensive. Beginning in 2023, close to 50,000 Venezuelans settled in metro Denver, including Aurora, in roughly the span of 18 months.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s like taking a small city and putting it inside of a big city,\u201d Rodriguez said. \u201cIt was stressful both for the newcomers and for the city itself.\u201d",
      "In Aurora, criminal activity among Venezuelans centered around three apartment complexes. The buildings, all owned by New York-based CBZ Management, were neglected for years before large numbers of Venezuelans moved in, city officials said.",
      "\u201cBacked-up sewage, leaking pipes, mold, rats \u2014 the gamut of all the things we think about when it comes to a slum,\u201d said Jason Batchelor, Aurora\u2019s city manager.",
      "(Two of the complexes have since been shut down by the city, one last year and one in February, and the third is under new management. CBZ Management did not respond to requests for comment.)",
      "Former residents of one complex said Tren de Aragua grew emboldened last summer, when gang members realized management had effectively abandoned the buildings.",
      "\u201cThey took the place over,\u201d said Carlos, a former resident of a particularly notorious apartment complex on Dallas Street, who spoke to NBC News on the condition that his last name be withheld over fear of retaliation from the gang. They dealt drugs, they stole cars, and they flashed guns, he said. \u201cThey would take vacant apartments and use them for parties. They would charge $20 at the door and have drugs and women.\u201d",
      "\u201cThey weren\u2019t afraid that anyone would report them. They weren\u2019t afraid of anything,\u201d Carlos said. \u201cIt was like living in a prison.\u201d",
      "On Aug. 18, a 25-year-old Venezuelan man was killed at the Dallas Street apartments in what police say was a gang-related shooting. As the shooters walked the halls searching for their target, they were captured by a doorbell camera, police said. The footage made national news and was seized on by Trump and his supporters.",
      "Rodriguez toured the troubled complexes with law enforcement in August. City officials wanted her in uniform, but she insisted on wearing civilian clothes.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s when I started hearing stories,\u201d Rodriguez said. She pieced together that the buildings were, at a minimum, the site of a crude protection racket, which started with gang members extorting fees from residents to park their cars and, when management abandoned the properties, grew to collecting the actual rent. Rodriguez noticed that the gang picked its targets based on their perceived vulnerability.",
      "In December, one woman, a Venezuelan immigrant, was unloading groceries outside the apartment complex when she was surrounded by armed men and dragged, along with her boyfriend, to a vacant apartment in the complex.",
      "The men bound the couple, beat them and tortured them with a knife, said the woman, who spoke to NBC News on condition of anonymity because she fears for her life. According to police, the kidnappers were members of Tren de Aragua.",
      "During her hours in captivity, she said, they showed her the footage of the armed men roaming the halls and told her the video was why they\u2019d kidnapped her. They were sick of the extra attention that had come from the Trump campaign\u2019s continued fixation on the video.",
      "\u201cThey told me, \u2018This is why we\u2019re getting harassed,\u2019\u201d she said.",
      "She had nothing to do with the original video, but she had recently recorded a different one, which showed two women fighting in the courtyard outside her apartment window surrounded by a crowd; unbeknownst to her, the group included several gang members. She said an acquaintance had taken the video from her phone and posted it online.",
      "So they were making an example of her. \u201cThey told us we weren\u2019t going to leave that apartment alive,\u201d she said. \u201cI was certain that I was going to die.\u201d",
      "The Trump effect",
      "The doorbell camera footage \u2014 and the gang\u2019s presence in Aurora \u2014 had become a major plot point in Trump\u2019s effort to demonize migrants in the U.S. and call for mass deportations during the 2024 presidential election.",
      "In October, Trump made a campaign stop in the city, where he promised to name his military roundup of gang members \u201cOperation Aurora.\u201d Tren de Aragua, Trump said, had \u201cinvaded and conquered\u201d the city with \u201cbetter guns than our military has.\u201d",
      "Trump has zeroed in on Latin American gangs before. During the 2016 presidential race, the target of his ire was MS-13, a gang that originated in Los Angeles but grew in Central America, and whose members had committed several violent crimes on Long Island, in New York. At the time, Trump said MS-13 gang members from El Salvador were coming to the U.S. illegally and as unaccompanied minors, holding up the gang as a reason for stricter immigration policies.",
      "Now, that focus has shifted to Tren de Aragua. Trump has cited the death of 22-year-old Laken Riley, a Georgia nursing student who was killed in February 2024, as the most egregious example of the gang\u2019s terror. A Venezuelan man, Jose Ibarra, was convicted in November of murder and kidnapping and is serving life in prison.",
      "Trump and conservative media routinely refer to Ibarra as a member of the gang. But neither the police who investigated the case nor the prosecutors who tried it have ever publicly made that claim themselves.",
      "Nationwide, federal prosecutors have identified suspected members of Tren de Aragua in six ongoing cases. Two of them, in Tennessee and Louisiana, involve sex trafficking schemes.",
      "Suspected Tren de Aragua operatives have also been known to move between cities where the gang is active: One of the men in the viral video from Aurora, for example, was arrested in New York City in January. Law enforcement officials call this a sign that the gang organizes its operations across state lines. Officials also say they have uncovered evidence that Tren de Aragua operatives in the U.S. are coordinating and communicating with gang leaders in Latin America.",
      "But there are flaws in some of the methods law enforcement uses to tie people to the gang. Federal and local authorities have claimed certain tattoos or types of clothing serve as markers of affiliation, including tattoos or jerseys related to Michael Jordan and the number 23. A Jordan tattoo was among the reasons one man was sent to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, along with 176 other Venezuelans, according to documents filed in a lawsuit by the American Civil Liberties Union and other groups. (All have since been moved off the island.) But Jordan imagery \u2014 and basketball generally \u2014 are popular in Venezuela.",
      "The gang is also prone to petty and reckless violence in a way more organized criminal groups are not. In Denver, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration has spent months surveilling pop-up nightclubs heavily featuring sex workers and a drug called tusi, or \u201cpink cocaine,\u201d typically a mixture of ketamine and a stimulant such as meth or MDMA. These events often end in gunfire.",
      "\u201cThey are not the Sinaloa Cartel,\u201d\u00a0said Jonathan Pullen, special agent in charge for the Rocky Mountain Field Division of the DEA in Denver, referring to the notorious Mexican syndicate. \u201cThey\u2019re not that massive in scope and they don\u2019t have that type of reach or control.\u201d",
      "The majority of crimes attributed to the gang in the U.S. are prosecuted at the state level. These offenses \u2014 homicide, assault, theft, extortion \u2014 do not require coordination across state lines, much less with a transnational criminal structure. They are crimes, in other words, that can be committed just as well by freelancers.",
      "\u201cWhat Tren de Aragua represents is not only an organization but also a model for criminal activity,\u201d said Ronna Risquez, a Venezuelan investigative journalist and expert on the gang. The model is successful in large part because it is easy to replicate.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s entirely possible that a lot of Venezuelans who ended up in the United States are deploying that criminal model without necessarily belonging to Tren de Aragua.\u201d",
      "Grappling with crime",
      "In September, police officials in Aurora created a team focused on crimes among Venezuelan migrants, which had daily phone calls to report progress, Police Chief Todd Chamberlain said.",
      "At first, the work was slow-going. The vast majority of Venezuelans had no interest in talking to police, he said. But a breakthrough came on Dec. 17, when they got a call from the woman who\u2019d been kidnapped.",
      "\u201cThey told us they would be keeping an eye on us, and that they\u2019d kill us if we reported anything,\u201d the woman told NBC News. She called 911 anyway. \u201cI didn\u2019t think twice. I told myself, \u2018The United States is a country where the laws actually mean something.\u2019\u201d",
      "Within hours, the police chief had mobilized officers at the apartment complex. Chamberlain called in help from Homeland Security Investigations, a unit of Immigration and Customs Enforcement tasked with investigating transnational crimes. Together they detained 19 people; 11 have been charged in the kidnapping so far.",
      "Local immigrant rights advocates say people who were not involved in the crime were caught up in the operation, which they say may have violated Colorado\u2019s sanctuary statute limiting law enforcement\u2019s ability to cooperate with immigration agents. Chamberlain disputes the claim, saying only people connected to the kidnapping were detained.",
      "Chamberlain\u2019s officers ultimately amassed evidence of a wide range of criminal activities at the complexes: vehicle and retail theft, extortion, intimidation and violence, narcotics, prostitution. In one especially dilapidated apartment, he said, gang members had set up a tent for clients\u2019 encounters with sex workers.",
      "The apartment complex closed in February \u2014 shut down by the city as a public nuisance. After the kidnapping, the Venezuelan woman moved away from Aurora, but she still spends most of her time indoors. \u201cWhen you\u2019re surrounded by guns, when they\u2019re doing things to you with a knife \u2026 you don\u2019t get over that so quickly,\u201d she said.",
      "She talks with reproach about the people who suffered or witnessed crimes in the apartment complex but stayed quiet. \u201cIf we had died that day, it would be partly on them,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople die because of fear.\u201d",
      "She is seriously considering leaving the United States. Where she settles after years of displacement, she said, is not up to her but to God \u2014 as is the fate of the people who attacked her.",
      "\u201cYou don\u2019t leave this world without paying what you owe,\u201d she said."

      "Soon after taking office,\u00a0President Donald Trump signed an executive order designed to ban transgender athletes from participating in girls\u2019 and women\u2019s sports.",
      "Last month, during a meeting with governors, Trump characterized Maine as out of line with the order and told the state's Democratic governor, Janet Mills, \"You better comply, because otherwise you're not getting any federal funding.\"",
      "Mills responded by saying: \u201cWe\u2019ll see you in court.\u201d",
      "The Trump administration followed by\u00a0launching an investigation into whether Maine violated Title IX, which prohibits sex-based discrimination in school programs, by allowing trans women and girls to participate in female sports.",
      "The clash plunged Maine into the national spotlight and reinvigorated a debate over gender and sports.",
      "Since that time, the Democratic majority in the Maine House of Representatives voted to\u00a0censure Republican State Rep. Laurel Libby\u00a0over a\u00a0controversial post she made\u00a0before the showdown between Trump and Mills about a high school athlete who won a girls\u2019 track competition. The post included a photo of the student and identified the student by first name, with the name in quotation marks, saying that the athlete had previously competed in boys\u2019 track.",
      "\u201cSharing images of kids online without their consent is a clear violation of the bond of trust and respect between citizens and their Legislators. There is a time and place for policy debates. That time and place will never be a social media post attacking a Maine student,\u201d House Speaker Ryan Fecteau said in February.",
      "Libby then filed a federal lawsuit against Fecteau and House clerk Robert Hunt claiming the censure violated her right to free speech. The lawsuit said the censure stripped her right to speak and vote on the House floor, and that disenfranchises the thousands of residents in her district.",
      "\u201cI have the constitutional right to speak out and my constituents have the right to full representation in the Maine House,\u201d Libby said in a statement. \u201cBiological males have no place in girls\u2019 sports. Our girls have every right, under federal law, to fair competition in sports.\u201d",
      "The lawsuit seeks a judgment that the censure is unlawful. It also seeks the restoration of Libby\u2019s voting and speaking rights on the House floor.",

    "story": [
      "Leland Dudek, the acting commissioner of the Social Security Administration, outlined his vision for the agency in a lengthy memo to staff on Tuesday, detailing exploratory efforts to implement artificial intelligence and boost anti-fraud efforts as President Donald Trump and his right-hand adviser Elon Musk have zeroed in on claims of widespread improper payments at the bureau.",
      "Before ascending to this position, Dudek previously worked at the agency\u2019s anti-fraud office. The bureau opened an investigation into him after he was suspected of improperly sharing information with Musk\u2019s U.S. DOGE Service; the Trump administration then placed him in charge of the agency.",
      "In the Tuesday memo, which was shared with NBC News by a person who obtained it, Dudek apologized for having made mistakes, said he will continue to make more and pledged to learn from them.",
      "\u201cOver the past month, this agency has seen an unprecedented level of media coverage, some of it true and deserved, while some has not been factual and painted the agency in a very negative light,\u201d Dudek wrote. \u201cI know this has been stressful for you and has caused disruption in your life. Personally, I have made some mistakes, which makes me human like you. I promise you this, I will continue to make mistakes, but I will learn from them. My decisions will always be with the best intentions for this agency, the people we serve, and you.\u201d",
      "Dudek's remarks on making mistakes echoes Musk, who has said DOGE \"will make mistakes\" but that they will be fixed \"very quickly.\"",
      "Dudek praised employees as \u201coutstanding,\u201d saying the agency \u201chasn\u2019t missed a beat\u201d amid the heightened attention. He then laid out where he believes the agency has \u201cmade meaningful progress\u201d in recent weeks.",
      "He highlighted three specific points: Working to \u201cprevent improper payments,\u201d improving telephone services and processing submissions from employees who chose the voluntary separation program that the Trump administration promoted.",
      "Dudek said 2,700 Social Security employees signed up for that program; 2,000 were deemed eligible, while more than 1,400 have signed their voluntary separation agreements.",
      "On the other items, Dudek pointed to \u201cexpanded data-sharing agreements\u201d with outside agencies as \u201ca key step toward reducing fraud and waste. On telephone services, Dudek noted that the agency is \u201cexploring ways to implement AI \u2014\u00a0in a safe, governed manner in accordance with\u201d guidance from the Office of Management and Budget \u201cto streamline and improve call resolution.\u201d",
      "The acting commissioner then outlined what he sees as the action plan for the agency over the next three months. Those items included a further zeroing-in on \u201cfraud and waste,\u201d as well as \u201coptimizing and empowering\u201d its workforce. On the latter, Dudek said the agency is \u201cnow in a good position to avoid reliance on involuntary reductions in our workforce for this fiscal year.\u201d",
      "Late last month, SSA said it plans to reduce its 57,000 workforce by 7,000 people.",
      "Dudek said the Trump administration's \"focus on detecting and eliminating fraud, waste and abuse is in line with our mission to pay the right person the right amount at the right time.\"",
      "Additionally, Dudek said he \u201cdirected our leadership team to present real-time data online so that the public can see how we are doing.\u201d",
      "\u201cI am increasing our anti-fraud efforts and leading with establishing state-of-the-art methods for identity proofing, which enables the public to securely interact with us online or over the phone,\u201d he continued.",
      "The Social Security Administration did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Dudek\u2019s tenure has been marked so far by wide-ranging proposals and big shifts that have quickly been walked back. Earlier this month, the agency scrapped plans to end phone services for filing disability and retirement claims, as The Washington Post reported. Instead, the agency will move forward with a narrower plan that will no longer allow Americans to change their bank information with the agency over the phone.",
      "Also this month, Dudek rescinded and apologized for an order that would have no longer allowed for parents in Maine to sign up for their newborns\u2019 Social Security numbers at hospitals, instead having to register them at a federal office.",
      "Michelle King, who previously served as the top official at the SSA, stepped down in February after she refused a request from the U.S. DOGE Service to access sensitive government records at the agency, NBC News previously reported.",
      "That same month, Musk tweeted glowingly of Dudek.",
      "\"There ARE good people in the government who want to eliminate fraud & waste,\" Musk wrote. \"Amazingly, Leland was fired by Social Security Administration upper management for helping @DOGE find taxpayer savings. Can you believe that?? Thanks to President Trump, Leland was brought back right away and now HE is upper management \ud83d\ude0e Promote good players, exit bad players. That\u2019s the right thing to do.\"",
      "Both Musk and Trump have heightened their focus on what they allege are improper payments flowing out of the agency. Democrats and critics have said this focus is merely a cover to cut Americans' earned benefits.",
      "Notably, Musk has pledged that DOGE will be able to cut anywhere from $1 trillion to $2 trillion in federal spending \u2014\u00a0a number that would be virtually impossible to hit without touching entitlement spending. In an interview with NBC News in December, Trump said \u201cwe\u2019re not touching\u201c Social Security when asked about proposed spending cuts.",
      "In a spate of more recent interviews, Musk has referred to Social Security as \"a Ponzi scheme,\" suggested it is paying out benefits to millions of dead Americans over 100 years old and is a vehicle for Democrats to make payments to undocumented immigrants. On Tuesday, the DOGE account on X tweeted that the Social Security Administration \"has begun a major cleanup of their records.\"",
      "\"Approximately 3.2 million numberholders, all listed age 120+, have now been marked as deceased,\" DOGE tweeted.\u00a0\"More work still to be done.\"",
      "During a joint speech to Congress, Trump joined in, claiming the administration was finding \"shocking levels of incompetence and probable fraud in the Social Security program for our seniors.\"",
      "Social Security is not fraudulently paying out benefits to millions of Americans age well beyond 100, as NBC News previously reported. Rather than fraud, the information Trump and Musk have pointed to as the basis of their claims amounted to a misreading of a known problem with the government's data. Though there are millions of people over age 100 in the SSA's database, the vast majority aren\u2019t receiving benefits. The agency\u2019s online records showed that fewer than 90,000 people over age 99 received retirement benefits in December.",
      "A 2023 report from the SSA\u2019s inspector general found that from 2015 to 2022, 0.84% of benefits payments were improper, totaling $71.8 billion over eight years. Most of those payments, the report said, were overpayments, not payments to deceased Americans or people who did not qualify for them. (In an interview on the podcast of Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, on Monday, Musk surmised that there was between $100 billion and $200 billion in entitlements fraud across federal benefit systems.)"

      "Japan is seen as an important market for baseball, which was introduced to the country in 1872 and is now its most popular spectator sport. Last week, Japan\u2019s Hanshin Tigers beat both the Dodgers and the Cubs in exhibition games in a sign that America\u2019s sport is being redefined as a global game.",

If higher courts uphold the decision, it could cut prosecutors off from successfully charging some people with the private possession of AI-generated CSAM.",
      "The case centers on Steven Anderegg, 42, of Holmen, Wisconsin, whom the Justice Department charged in May with \u201cproducing, distributing, and possessing obscene visual depictions of minors engaged in sexually explicit conduct and transferring obscene material to a minor under the age of 16.\u201d",
      "Prosecutors alleged that he used an AI image generator called Stable Diffusion to create over 13,000 images depicting child sexual abuse by entering text prompts into the technology that then generated fake images depicting non-real children. (Some AI systems are also used to create explicit images of known people, but prosecutors do not claim that is what Anderegg was doing.)",
      "In February, in response to Anderegg\u2019s motion to dismiss the charges, U.S. District Judge James D. Peterson allowed three of the charges to move forward but threw one out, saying the First Amendment protects the possession of \u201cvirtual child pornography\u201d in one\u2019s home. On March 3, prosecutors appealed.",
      "In the decision, Peterson denied Anderegg\u2019s request to dismiss charges of distribution of an obscene image of a minor, transfer of obscene matter to a person under 16 and production of an image of a minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct.",
      "Anderegg\u2019s lawyer did not respond to a request for comment. The Justice Department declined to comment.",
      "Many AI platforms have tried to prevent their tools from being used in creating such content, but some safety guardrails can easily be modified or removed, and a July study from the Internet Watch Foundation found that the amount of AI-generated CSAM posted online is increasing.",
      "The Justice Department alleged in a news release in May that Anderegg described his image-making process in a chat with a 15-year-old boy and sent the images to the teenager. Law enforcement was alerted to Anderegg after Instagram reported his account to the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children, the release said.",
      "The Justice Department has argued that the 2003 Protect Act, while not specifically referring to it, criminalizes AI-generated CSAM by banning \u201cobscene visual representations of the sexual abuse of children.\u201d",
      "Peterson referred to a 1969 Supreme Court ruling, Stanley v. Georgia, which said private possession of obscene material in one\u2019s own home cannot be made a crime.",
      "That ruling has not traditionally been applied to cases involving CSAM that includes real children, which have typically been tried under a different set of laws about the sexual exploitation of minors, such as banning the transport or sale of CSAM."

If you can put aside your disgust of Duke for a moment, the Blue Devils are projected by many draft experts to have three players selected in the top-10 of the upcoming NBA draft.",
      "By now, you probably know about Cooper Flagg, the forward who is the presumptive No. 1 pick this June. Flagg was the No. 1 recruit in the high school class of 2024, and last summer he earned an invite to practice against the U.S. men\u2019s Olympic\u00a0squad\u00a0as part of the Select Team. He averaged 18.9 points, 7.5 rebounds and 4.1 assists a contest as a freshman.",
      "The other names to know are forward Kon Knueppel, a shot-making forward whose 3-point prowess makes him attractive to pretty much any team, and Khaman Maluach, a center who can offer teams a potential defensive anchor and rim runner at the next level.",
      "Team you wish you could watch: Rutgers Scarlet Knights",
      "No team epitomizes the dichotomy of the college and NBA games better than the Scarlet Knights. Rutgers is expected to have two players \u2014 guard Dylan Harper and forward Ace Bailey \u2014 selected in the lottery.",
      "Both the NBA\u2019s and ESPN\u2019s mock drafts have Harper going second and Bailey going third, respectively. The only problem? The Scarlet Knights missed the tournament and also declined an invitation to the NIT.",
      "Another team with potentially multiple first-round picks: Illinois Fighting Illini",
      "First game: Friday at 9:45 p.m. ET, opponent TBD",
      "Guard Kasparas Jakucionis and forward Will Riley are both possible first-round selections. Jakucionis has a chance to go in the top 10, while Riley is most often projected as going final third of the first.",
      "Bleacher Report\u2019s Jonathan Wasserman describes Jakucionis as a Chauncey Billups-type guard who can thrive off the ball. Meanwhile, ESPN bills Riley as a player whose size on the wing could be an asset, though he still has room for improvement as a shooter.",
      "Player who could shoot his way into your heart: Tre Johnson",
      "First game: Wednesday at 9:10 p.m. ET vs. Xavier",
      "Texas Longhorns guard Tre Johnson is an unapologetic scorer who seems to have emerged as the fifth-best player in the upcoming draft class. Nearly every mock has a consensus top four in Flagg, Harper, Bailey and the Baylor Bears\u2019 V.J. Edgecombe. Johnson is the player who most often pops up after them.",
      "Johnson is a gunner who is not afraid to let it fly. He can create for himself on the perimeter and seems to have NBA-ready scoring talent.",
      "The Longhorns are no guarantee to make a tournament run, however. Texas will play in the First Four for an opportunity to make the 64-team field. A big night from Johnson could give him a March bump.",

But neither the Gators or Tigers have players who most mockers expect to appear in the lottery.",
      "In fact, while Clayton Jr. and Broome both have a chance to be drafted, don\u2019t expect to hear their names called until much later in the first round or even the second. Both Auburn and Florida have had great seasons. If you love watching the two teams play, appreciate what their stars do now, because they may not get a chance to shine as bright in the NBA."

    "story": [
      "The issue of diversity, equity and inclusion programs is among the most tightly divided and polarizing questions in the United States at this time, with wide gaps emerging along partisan and racial lines, according to the latest national NBC News poll.",
      "President Donald Trump has made dismantling DEI programs an early focus of his administration, and voters are split over the future of the programs in the workplace, with deep differences depending on their political party.",
      "Half of registered voters (49%) in the NBC News poll say DEI programs should be eliminated \u201cbecause they create divisions and inefficiencies in the workplace by putting too much emphasis on race and other social factors over merit, skills and experience.\u201d",
      "And 48% say DEI programs in the workplace should continue \u201cbecause diverse perspectives reflect our country, create innovative ideas and solutions, encourage unity and make our workplaces fair and inclusive.\u201d",
      "Asked to share whether they have positive or negative feelings about DEI programs, a slightly higher share of voters (43%) say they have negative feelings, while 39% have positive views and 14% are neutral.\u00a0(The poll's margin of error is plus or minus 3.1 percentage points.)",
      "The divides over DEI are part of a broader cultural split. In another question in the poll asking them to pick between two different statements, 51% of voters say there is \u201ctoo much political correctness in our society today, and too much pressure on people to limit what they can do or say to avoid offending other people.\u201d Meanwhile, 45% say there is \u201ctoo much prejudice in our society today and people need to be more respectful in what they do and say to avoid offending other people.\u201d",
      "Trump issued an executive order on his first day in office to end DEI programs at federal agencies, which prompted some private companies to also roll back programs focused on increasing diversity in the workplace. The Education Department has launched investigations of more than 50 colleges and universities as part of a broader push against DEI programs. The Federal Communications Commission also moved to open an inquiry into DEI practices at Comcast. (Comcast owns NBCUniversal, the parent company of NBC News.)",
      "\u201cWhen we see these heated conversations at a partisan level about DEI, it really comes down to: How are they looking at American society today? Where do they see the problems? And that\u2019s going to lead to very different solutions and very different approaches,\u201d said Democratic pollster Aileen Cardona-Arroyo of Hart Research Associates, which conducted the poll with Public Opinion Strategies, a Republican polling firm.",
      "Beneath the surface of the overall division in the electorate are wide gaps depending on voters\u2019 party affiliation and race. Fully 80% of Republicans believe there is too much political correctness, while 77% of Democrats say there is too much prejudice. Independents are split, with 46% saying there is too much political correctness and 43% saying there is too much prejudice.",
      "An overwhelming share of Republicans (85%) believe DEI programs should be eliminated, while the same share of Democrats believe they should continue. More independents side with Democrats on that question, with 59% saying DEI programs should continue and 39% saying they should be eliminated.",
      "And while younger people were more likely to support DEI programs than older respondents, the issue highlights another example of a wide gender gap among younger voters on politics in the Trump era.",
      "Among women ages 18 to 49, 67% say DEI programs should continue, while 31% want to eliminate them. But among men ages 18 to 49, 40% want to continue DEI programs, while 57% say they should be eliminated. More older women support DEI programs than older men, but the gap between them is not as large.",
      "\u201cThe survey also points to there being more political intensity and salience for Republicans around these issues than there is for Democrats,\u201d Cardona-Arroyo said, noting the overwhelmingly negative views of DEI programs from voters who make up Trump\u2019s base, including white men without a college education, self-described MAGA Republicans and self-described conservatives.",
      "Republican pollster Bill McInturff of Public Opinion Strategies said that Trump\u2019s actions on DEI and other issues such as immigration underscore the president\u2019s near-unified support from Republicans, which has bolstered Trump\u2019s early approval numbers.",
      "\u201cYou can see how his efforts, including on DEI, are just really echoing with his core political base,\u201d McInturff said.",
      "The survey also finds divisions along racial lines, with a majority of white voters saying DEI programs should end and that there is too much political correctness in society. White women with college degrees were the exception among white voters, with 59% saying there is too much prejudice and two-thirds saying DEI programs should continue.",
      "An overwhelming share of Black voters (80%) say DEI programs should persist, and 71% say there is too much prejudice in society today. The share of Latino voters in the survey was too small to analyze the group\u2019s overall views on the issue.",
      "The NBC News poll surveyed 1,000 registered voters from March 7-11 via a mix of telephone interviews and an online survey sent via text message. The margin of error is plus or minus 3.1 percentage points."

      "\u201cLet me just say Mike White doesn\u2019t make it easy for us, because these books are so obscure,\u201d Edwards says with a laugh, referring to the show\u2019s creator.",
      "The 26-year-old put his degree in English literature and his internet detective skills to the test to identify the books the characters in \u201cThe White Lotus\u201d have been reading.",
      "\u201cI always said that I thought my my English degree was just a long-term investment into being good at pub quizzes, but it turns out it\u2019s also good identifying books in \u2018The White Lotus,\u2019\u201d he says with a grin.",
      "Edwards says he appreciates the detail behind the props and wardrobe design on the show, because it allows viewers to think about what they are seeing each week, as opposed to binging the full season in one watch.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s something quite pleasant and satisfactory about having to linger on a show like this, where it\u2019s being rolled out weekly,\u201d Edwards says. \u201cI think maybe that\u2019s why we\u2019re seeing so many theories and so much debate around what could possibly happen.\u201d",
      "Here are the books featured on Season 3 of \u201cThe White Lotus \u2014 and what could be in store for the characters based on what they\u2019re reading.",
      "'Hunger' by Knut Hamsun",
      "Lochlan (Sam Nivola) is reading one of the first books seen in Season 3. During Episode 4, Lochlan\u2019s older brother Saxon (Patrick Schwarzenegger) asks him what he\u2019s doing, and he replies that he\u2019s reading. Saxon responds, \u201cWhy?\u201d",
      "Edwards says the scene represents the difference between the two brothers. Even though they are siblings and had almost identical educations, one values reading and the other does not.",
      "\u201cOne of those characters wants to learn, is inquisitive, and the other one is the sort of nepo baby figure who has had everything handed to him on a plate,\u201d he says. \u201cSo even there, I think we can see a different dynamic in who is reading and who isn\u2019t.\u201d",
      "In the scene, Lochlan holds up the book, which Edwards says he watched frame by frame, trying to get a clear shot of the book. He  ultimately identified the cover as an Oxford World's Classics edition.",
      "\u201cSo I Googled, \u2018How many Oxford World\u2019s Classics are there?\u2019 and it was, like, a horror movie sound effect when I realized there were 929. But I am nothing if not committed to the bit, and I scrolled through them,\u201d he says, noting there is a full Oxford archive online.",
      "On the penultimate page, Edwards finally spotted one that looked familiar: \u201cHunger\u201d by Knut Hamsun.",
      "According to the book\u2019s description, \u201cHunger\u201d follows an aspiring writer as he tries to make ends meet in the city. The narrative becomes blurred as the voice of the narrator shifts between a level assessment of his situation and wild outbursts of anger and despair.",
      "\u201cWhen I was looking into it, it\u2019s about a young man who was trying to establish himself, but he does so with unease and sensitivity,\u201d Edwards says. \u201cAnd when I then thought about Lochlan\u2019s character, I was like, well, that completely adds up for who he is.\u201d",
      "\u201cSo it\u2019s actually quite intentional, I think who reads and who doesn\u2019t,\u201d he continues.",
      "'Surrounded by Narcissists' by Thomas Erikson",
      "Viewers first see Belinda (Natasha Rothwell) reading a book alone by the pool. But almost as soon as she picks it up, she puts it back down to go inside to research Greg (Jon Gries).",
      "When she puts the book down on her desk, Edwards was able to see part of the cover and the words \u201cSurrounded By,\u201d which he says was more than enough for him to narrow it down to \u201cSurrounded by Narcissists\u201d by Thomas Erikson.",
      "Erikson\u2019s book describes what qualities make up a narcissist, and teaches readers how to manage other people\u2019s narcissistic behaviors so they can pursue a happier life, the book\u2019s description reads.",
      "\u201cSo again, that feels like a very deliberate choice,\u201d he says. \u201cShe seems to be the person who is able to contextualize this hotel. As we\u2019re seeing it, it\u2019s the Full Moon Party in Thailand right now \u2014 it\u2019s a festival \u2014 and no one seems to be engaging with it at all, whereas Belinda is much more aware of her surroundings and the social hierarchies of the space she\u2019s in.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe can see that Belinda is much more self-aware than the rest of the characters about their kind of social status and where they exist within the hierarchy,\u201d he adds. \u201cSo I thought that was interesting, that she\u2019s reading \u2018Surrounded by Narcissists,\u2019 and it feels like a fun commentary for the people who notice.\u201d",
      "Belinda is seen reading the book again in Episode 5, as she\u2019s trying to relax in her room when she starts hearing a noise (which ends up being the lizard Pornchai chases out of her room).",

      "Parker Posey\u2019s character Victoria Ratliff reads F. Scott Fitzgerald\u2019s \u201cThe Beautiful and the Damned\u201d throughout Season 3 of the show.",
      "The meaning of the title can be taken literally in her character\u2019s case, Edwards says.",
      "\u201cThis family is beautiful, like those genes are strong,\u201d he says. \u201cBut from this episode, we can see this family was doomed.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe Beautiful and the Damned\u201d is widely believed to have been based on Fitzgerald\u2019s relationship with his wife Zelda Fitzgerald. The book follows a 25-year-old Harvard graduate who falls deeply in love and enters into a reckless marriage. The pair live a life of decadence, thinking they will receive inheritance money, but their lifestyle ultimately leads to their ruin and the end of their marriage.",
      "\u201cThat book is about success and money and wealth and how relationships survive in times of difficulty,\u201d he says.",
      "The book is also about substance abuse \u2014 specifically alcoholism. \"I think we\u2019re seeing substance abuse being referenced a little bit more in the show. But again, it feels very deliberate,\" Edwards says.",
      "Chelsea's book",
      "Aimee Lou Wood's character Chelsea reads a book throughout the season, though Edwards says he hasn't been able to get a good enough view of the book to identify it.",
      "\u201cI need a few more clips of her reading. Every time I\u2019m like, \u2018Come on Mike. Give us another shot on the other side this time, please!\u2019 But I feel like they drip feed them throughout the series, so hopefully, next episode,\u201d he says. \u201cI just want you to know if they show a clip of her reading that book from the front, just know I\u2019m jumping for joy at home.\u201d",
      "Some Reddit users have hypothesized the book could be \u201cStart Where You Are: How to Accept Yourself and Others\u201d by Pema Chodron due to its light purple cover, but it is unclear if it\u2019s the exact book Chelsea is reading at this point in the season.",
      "According to the book's description, readers work with slogans and meditation practices to work on their inner pain and discover joy.",
      "Piper's book",
      "Piper (Sarah Catherine Hook) can be seen reading a book called \"The Loving Kindness\" in the third season as well, though Edwards thinks it may be a book created specifically for her character.",
      "In Episode 5, Piper reveals to her parents that she didn't actually want to go to Thailand to write her thesis \u2014 it's because she wants to move to the country to study under a monk.",
      "\u201cI think that it\u2019s a fake book, and that it\u2019s that it\u2019s meant to be the monk that she\u2019s studying,\u201d Edwards says. \u201cI think it's interesting that she\u2019s more willing to engage in text. It\u2019s more palatable when it\u2019s a book rather than the actual person who could challenge her.\u201d"

    "summary": "What happened to Haymitch Abernathy in \"The Hunger Games\"? Here's what to remember about the character before \"Sunrise on the Reaping.\"",
    "story": [
      "We know the story of Katniss Everdeen's time in the arena. Now, Suzanne Collins is telling the tale of how Katniss' mentor, Haymitch Abernathy, survived the Hunger Games \u2014 more than 20 years before Katniss' story begins.",
      "In \"Sunrise on the Reaping,\" the fifth book in the \"Hunger Games\" franchise, Collins chronicles the events of the 50th Hunger Games. The annual event sees children from the districts in the dystopian country of Panem fight to the death as entertainment for its Capitol \u2014\u00a0a punishment for a decades-old rebellion.",
      "The first \"Hunger Games\" book, which was published in 2008, follows the events of the 74th Hunger Games, when 16-year-old Katniss Everdeen from District 12 famously volunteered as tribute in her sister's place. The next two books in the series see her become a reluctant leader of a districtwide rebellion against the Capitol and face off against Panem's dictatorial president, Coriolanus Snow.",
      "Collins returned to Panem in 2020 with the book \"The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes,\" which tells Snow's villain origin story against the backdrop of the 10th annual Hunger Games. It details how he turned the Games into a spectacle while mentoring District 12 tribute Lucy Gray Baird.",
      "\"Sunrise on the Reaping,\" out March 18, is Collins' second spinoff book of the \"Hunger Games\" trilogy.",
      "Here's what to remember before returning to the world of Panem.",
      "Who is Haymitch Abernathy?",
      "Haymitch Abernathy is introduced in the first \"Hunger Games\" book as the drunken mentor of Katniss and her male tribute counterpart, Peeta Mellark. As the only surviving victor from District 12, Haymitch is tasked with preparing Katniss and Peeta for the Games.",
      "In the first book, he travels with them to the Capitol, but he spends most of his time drinking. After Katniss fights back against his perceived indifference, he realizes her potential to succeed in the Games, and he helps Katniss and Peeta strategize.",
      "During the Games, he's also responsible for sending resources, including water and medicine, bought by sponsors to his tributes in the arena.",
      "While mentoring Katniss and Peeta, he gradually reveals things about his own traumatic experience in the 50th Games, also known as the Second Quarter Quell.",
      "What is a Quarter Quell?",
      "A Quarter Quell is a special version of the Hunger Games that comes around every 25 years. Each Quarter Quell brings a different twist. For Haymitch's Games, there were double the amount of tributes, making him one of four tributes reaped from District 12.",
      "The second \"Hunger Games\" book, \"Catching Fire,\" follows the third Quarter Quell, or the 75th Hunger Games. This time around, tributes were reaped from the pool of surviving victors. For District 12, that pool consists of Katniss, Peeta and Haymitch, guaranteeing the trilogy's heroine would go back into the arena. While Haymitch was named the male tribute by the luck of the draw, Peeta immediately volunteers to take his place.",
      "During \"Catching Fire,\" Haymitch again serves as Katniss and Peeta's mentor. But in the background, he also coordinates with District 13's underground resistance effort and undercover rebel Gamemaker Plutarch Heavensbee to rescue tributes from the arena.",
      "At the end of the book, Katniss finally learns of the conspiracy to start a second rebellion from Haymitch. In \"Mockingjay,\" he serves as one of the rebellion's leaders, providing unconditional support to Katniss as conflict between her and District 13's President Coin emerges.",
      "What happened during the 50th Hunger Games?",
      "Well, we're about to find out.",
      "The book's synopsis teases what's ahead for Haymitch.",
      "\"Haymitch Abernathy is trying not to think too hard about his chances,\" it reads. \"All he cares about is making it through the day and being with the girl he loves. When Haymitch\u2019s name is called, he can feel all his dreams break. He\u2019s torn from his family and his love, shuttled to the Capitol with the three other District 12 tributes: a young friend who\u2019s nearly a sister to him, a compulsive oddsmaker, and the most stuck-up girl in town. As the Games begin, Haymitch understands he\u2019s been set up to fail. But there\u2019s something in him that wants to fight ... and have that fight reverberate far beyond the deadly arena.\"",
      "Notably, the first three books allude to significant moments from Haymitch\u2019s time in the arena. In \"Catching Fire,\" Katniss and Peeta even watch tape from the 50th Hunger Games to prepare for the Third Quarter Quell.",
      "We learn that one of the female tributes from District 12 was a girl named Maysilee Donner, and she and Haymitch form an alliance at some point in the Games.",
      "Haymitch spends much of the Games exploring the edge of the arena, trying to see what lies at the end of it. When he finally reaches the edge, he finds a force field. That force field becomes his saving grace. He ultimately wins the Games after the only other remaining tribute throws an ax toward him and the edge of the arena \u2014 only for the weapon to rebound and kill her.",
      "After his time in the arena, we know his family and girlfriend are murdered by President Snow for his perceived defiance. He turns to alcohol to cope with the trauma and the consistent loss of the tributes he mentors in the Games until Katniss and Peeta's turn.",
      "At the end of \"Mockingjay,\" he returns to District 12 with Katniss and Peeta and takes up raising geese as the country of Panem rebuilds."

      "Critics are saying \"Adolescence\" is \"complete perfection\" and a harrowing, hard-to-watch that looks at the challenges and pitfalls young people face on the internet.",
      "The action kicks off straight away. Three minutes into Episode 1, the police barge into a seemingly normal home in England, guns at the ready.",
      "After passing by Jamie's parents \u2014 Manda Miller (Christine Tremarco), who drops to the ground in her bathrobe, and Eddie Miller (creator Stephen Graham) \u2014 the police arrest Jamie, still underneath the bed covers.",

      "What is Jamie accused of? And what could have pushed him toward it? Below, find out the inspiration behind this intense story.",
      "Is 'Adolescence' based on a true story?",
      "Stephen Graham, the show's co-creator who also played Eddie Miller, told Netflix's press site Tudum that a series of recent stabbings by boys inspired the tale.",
      "\u201cThere was an incident where a young boy (allegedly) stabbed a girl,\u201d Graham said. \u201cIt shocked me. I was thinking, \u2018What\u2019s going on? What\u2019s happening in society where a boy stabs a girl to death? What\u2019s the inciting incident here?\u2019 And then it happened again, and it happened again, and it happened again. I really just wanted to shine a light on it, and ask, \u2018Why is this happening today? What\u2019s going on? How have we come to this?\u2019\"",
      "Fifteen-year-old Elianne Andam, for example, was stabbed to death in London in September by Hassan Sentamu, then 17. Sentamu was sentenced to a minimum of 23 years in prison per a March court sentencing.",
      "Graham said that with the show, one of his goals was to answer the question, \"What is happening to our young men these days and what are the pressures they face from their peers, from the internet and from social media?\"",
      "\"And the pressures that come from all of those things are as difficult for kids here as they are the world over,\" he continued to tell Tudum.",
      "Graham told Rolling Stone that when he sees these stories of kids committing violent acts on the news, he knows he's \"not alone in blaming the parents sometimes.\"",
      "Because of this, he wanted to create a narrative where the crime decidedly isn't the parents' fault.",

      "\"I didn\u2019t want him to be a violent dad who would raise his hand to his children. It\u2019s the same for the mum too; we imagined her as a manager for John Lewis. Let\u2019s take all of those normal common denominators away from the table, and let\u2019s just concentrate on something that\u2019s happened with the boy here.\u201d",
      "Instead of his parents, it's the internet, and certain radical groups, that have an impact on Jamie. He was inspired by looking at his own son's interactions with friends and social media use.",
      "\"It was just about looking at the influence that certain people can have upon our children without our knowledge,\" he said.",
      "As an example, Graham said his son sent him a workout video. A few days after watching the video, his algorithm showed him the same creator, this time spouting \"misogynistic opinions and views.\"",
      "\u201cI was able to say, \u2018Yeah, that\u2019s not for me,\u2019 but what if I was a 13-year-old boy who didn\u2019t really have an ideal relationship with my father, and all of a sudden I\u2019m seeing this man who has everything I aspire to have \u2014 a fancy car and loads of money \u2014 this man who is everything I, maybe, aspire to be. If you\u2019re influencing the youth with your own views and opinions, then surely you know that we need to be mindful of what\u2019s being said?\u201d",
      "As for the project as a whole, Graham tells Rolling Stone it's something he's \"very proud to have been a part of.\"",

      "Hudson had spent the entirety of his four-year NFL career with the Cleveland Browns before signing with the Giants, who are coming off one of the most disastrous seasons in team history. They went 3-14 and are set to pick third in next month\u2019s NFL draft, so if T-Pain has any ideas about how to score more points, while allowing opposing teams to score fewer, maybe he'd be interested in contacting the Giants."

    "story": [
      "Social media has fallen in love with Doechii's \"Anxiety.\"",
      "Doechii, whose real name is Jaylah Ji\u2019mya Hickmon, first recorded the song in her bedroom. Until recently, the song was only available on YouTube as part of her \"Coven Music Sessions,\" first posted in 2020.",
      "\u201cAnxiety\u201d samples Gotye and Kimbra\u2019s song \u201cSomebody That I Used to Know.\u201d While Gotye sings about the pain of losing a romantic partner in his smash hit, Doechii instead raps about the struggles she faces from constant worrying.",
      "A few years after Doechii dropped the song, rapper Sleepy Hollow used the hook from the chorus to make his own track of the same name. Sleepy Hollow's version arrived in 2023 and it reached No. 44 on\u00a0Billboard's Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs.",
      "Recently, the spotlight has been on Doechii. She swept the Grammys earlier this year, winning best new artist, best rap album and best rap performance for her album \"Alligator Bites Never Heal.\"",
      "While \"Anxiety\" is not on her award-winning album, the song picked up steam on TikTok, where it inspired a dance trend. Using the song, people have been re-creating a scene from \"The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air\" where Will Smith sneaks up on Ashley Banks (Tatyana Ali) and copies her dance moves.",
      "The trend brings the song's chorus to life: \"Somebody\u2019s watchin\u2019 me / It\u2019s my anxiety, yeah.\"",
      "Doechii released the full version of her song on March 4, years after she first recorded it. She also explained the timeline of the \"Anxiety\" saga in a March 4 TikTok announcing the song's release.",
      "\"OK, so just a quick rundown on 'Anxiety,'\" she said while talking fast. \"'Anxiety' is a song that Sleepy Hollow dropped, but, he sampled my song, and then I, years ago, did a remix of 'Somebody That I Used To Know.' I titled it, 'Anxiety,' and I wrote a completely different song, and now it's blowing up on TikTok, and everybody's requesting it and it's out now!\"",
      "What is 'Anxiety' about?",
      "\"Anxiety\" is about what appears to be Doechii's experiences with worrying and mental health.",
      "She describes the physical sensation of anxiety in the lyrics, saying it's like a \"tightness\" in her chest \u2014 or \"lke an elephant is standin\u2019 on me.\"",
      "The song is a battle between anxiety and Doechii's higher mind. At points in the song, Doechii lets anxiety \"take over,\" and at other points, she fights back.",
      "She likens anxiety to something that is trying to \u201csilence\u201d her. She is aware and tries to counteract its effects: \u201cGotta shake it off of me\u201d and \u201ccan\u2019t let it caution me,\u201d she sings at points.",
      "But it\u2019s a battle. The song ends with the back-and-forth experience of anxiety, like a spiral \u2014 wanting to shake it off, being unable to, then trying again.",
      "\u201cCan\u2019t shake it off of me, shake, shake it off of me / It\u2019s my anxiety, gotta shake it off of me,\u201d she sings, creating a sense of lingering unease.",
      "Read the lyrics to Doechii's 'Anxiety'",

      "\u201cFrom now on, Israel will act against Hamas with increasing military force,\u201d it said, with the Israeli military later issuing evacuation orders to several neighborhoods across the enclave.",
      "The health ministry in Hamas-ruled Gaza, whose figures the World Health Organization has previously said it considers to be reliable, said hospitals across the enclave had received the bodies of at least 404 people killed, with more than 560 injured. It added that people were still buried under rubble, with recovery efforts underway.",
      "Dr. Muneer Al-Boursh, the ministry's director-general said \"most of the victims\" were women and children as he called on Gaza's residents to donate blood.",
      "While Tuesday's strikes are not the first to happen during the ceasefire, their scale puts the two-month-old ceasefire on shaky ground, although neither Israel or Hamas have explicitly said they considered the current ceasefire to be over.",
      "Follow along for live coverage",
      "Still, Hamas accused Israeli officials of having violated the terms of the truce.\u201cNetanyahu and his extremist government have decided to overturn the ceasefire agreement and are exposing the prisoners in Gaza to an unknown fate,\u201d Hamas said in a statement.",
      "Video captured by NBC News' crew on the ground in southern Gaza's Khan Younis showed scenes of people being rushed to Nasser Hospital, while bloodied bodies could be seen being laid down on the floor and on metal stretchers, including those of young children.",
      "Dr. Tanya Haj-Hassan, a volunteer with Medical Aid for Palestinians' emergency medical team at Nasser Hospital described the \"frenzy\" Tuesday morning as having \"felt like Armageddon.\"",
      "\u201cThe windows were shaking, the doors flew open, it was non-stop and then within about ten minutes we started hearing the sirens,\" she said in a statement shared by MAP with NBC News.",
      "Gaza Civil Defense spokesman Mahmoud Basal said early Tuesday that dozens of people had been killed and wounded, following attacks on homes.",
      "\u201cOur crews are unable to deal with the attacks due to limited resources and the dangerous situation,\u201d Basal said. \u201cWe call on the world to stop this aggression.\u201d",
      "The Israeli military issued evacuation orders Tuesday morning to Palestinians in neighborhoods across the enclave in Beit Hanoun, Khirbet Khuza\u2019a, Abasan al-Kabira, and al-Jadidah, saying they were \"dangerous combat zones.\" Residents were told to evacuate to known shelters in western Gaza City and Khan Younis.",
      "The strikes were the heaviest Israeli military bombardment in Gaza since the ceasefire deal was reached in January and brought a pause to fighting that followed the Hamas-led Oct. 7 terrorist attacks, when more than 1,200 people were killed and 250 taken hostage."

      "HONG KONG \u2014 Chinese state media are celebrating President Donald Trump\u2019s move to gut Voice of America and other U.S. government-funded news outlets that push back against authoritarian regimes.",
      "His executive order Friday dismantling Voice of America, Radio Free Asia and other outlets has been criticized as another blow to longstanding U.S. soft power efforts, amid fears that eroding U.S. influence abroad could create opportunities for governments such as China and Russia to promote their values instead.",
      "The government of China, where media is tightly controlled by the ruling Chinese Communist Party, has long criticized coverage by VOA and other U.S. government-funded news outlets. In an editorial Monday, the state-backed nationalist tabloid Global Times called VOA a \u201clie factory\u201d with an \u201cappalling track record\u201d when it comes to China-related reporting.",
      "From alleged human rights violations in the Chinese region of Xinjiang to the origins of the coronavirus and Chinese military aggression in the South China Sea, \u201calmost every malicious falsehood about China has VOA\u2019s fingerprints all over it,\u201d the editorial read, calling the news outlet a \u201cfrontline propaganda tool.\u201d",
      "VOA, which some Republicans had criticized as being biased against conservatives, has been in Trump\u2019s crosshairs since his first term.",
      "Fears for the outlet were raised last year when he said he wanted it to be led by ally Kari Lake, a former news anchor who accused journalists of anti-Trump bias during her two failed runs for statewide office in Arizona. Instead she was made a special adviser to the U.S. Agency for Global Media, the independent U.S. government agency that oversees Voice of America, Radio Free Europe/Radio Free Liberty, Radio Free Asia and other editorially independent outlets.",
      "\u201cFrom top-to-bottom this agency is a giant rot and burden to the American taxpayer \u2014 a national security risk for this nation \u2014 and irretrievably broken,\u201d Lake said in a statement Saturday.",
      "Elon Musk, who is leading Trump\u2019s government cost-cutting initiative, called for VOA to be shut down last month, saying, \u201cNobody listens to them anymore\u201d and \u201cit\u2019s just radical left crazy people talking to themselves while torching\u201d taxpayer money.",

      "\u201cIn the current international context, we want to be able to develop our most strategic projects with our closest, more loyal partners,\u201d Macron said, adding that \u201cwe are stronger together, better able to ensure the respect of our interests, the full exercise of our sovereignty.\u201d",

During his swearing-in, he noted the country was built on the bedrock of three peoples, French, English and Indigenous. He said Canada is fundamentally different from America and will \u201cnever, ever, in any way shape or form, be part of the United States.\u201d",
      "\u201cI want to ensure that France, and the whole of Europe, works enthusiastically with Canada, the most European of non-European countries, and at the same time resolutely North American, determined, like you, to maintain the most positive relations possible with the United States,\u201d Carney said Monday.",
      "Since Trump came to office, he has imposed whopping tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminum and repeatedly commented on turning Canada into the 51st state, infuriating Canadians and sparking a call to boycott U.S. products across the country.",

      "\u201cThe fact that Canada never broke away from the U.K. in a violent fashion is a key historical and institutional difference between the United States and Canada, a constitutional monarchy rather than a republic that has adopted and retained a U.K.-style parliamentary system,\u201d B\u00e9land said.",
      "The trip to London will be a kind of homecoming. Carney became the first non-British governor in the Bank of England\u2019s 319-year history when he took the job on July 1, 2013. He served until March 15, 2020.",
      "Carney, who turned 60 on Sunday, has said he\u2019s ready to meet with Trump if he shows respect for Canadian sovereignty.

His government is also reviewing the purchase of U.S.-made F-35 fighter jets in light of Trump\u2019s trade war.",
      "Meanwhile, Macron has been increasing efforts to persuade France\u2019s allies to move away from purchases of American military hardware, which also coincides with mounting concerns in Europe that European defenses are overly dependent on U.S. weaponry, technical support and goodwill.",
      "Macron touched on the French-British plan for securing any ceasefire in Ukraine.",
      "\u201cThis common commitment at the side of the Ukrainians has always aimed for a peace that is solid and lasting,\u201d Macron said. \u201cCanada and France are powers of peace, reliable allies, which will take part together in this effort.\u201d He did not give details.",
      "Carney spoke with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy by phone late Sunday and invited him to the G7 summit this summer that Canada is hosting.",
      "Trump said he would speak to Russian President Vladimir Putin on Tuesday as he pushes to end the war in Ukraine.",
      "Carney is expected to call a parliamentary election by the end of the week, to take place in late April or early May. Canada\u2019s governing Liberal Party had appeared poised for a historic election defeat this year until Trump declared economic war. Now, the party and its new leader could come out on top."

      "BOSTON \u2014 A former mayor from Haiti is set to go on trial Monday after authorities say he lied on his visa application about committing rights abuses in his country.",
      "Jean Morose Viliena, who has been living just north of Boston in the city of Malden, Massachusetts, was indicted in 2023 on three counts of visa fraud. Authorities said he wrote on his application that he had not \u201cordered, carried out or materially assisted in extrajudicial and political killings and other acts of violence against the Haitian people.\u201d",
      "But federal prosecutors allege that while mayor of the town of Les Irois, a community of about 22,000 on Haiti\u2019s western tip, Viliena was involved in acts of violence against political foes.",
      "In 2007, prosecutors said, he led a group of his allies to the home of a political opponent, where he and his associates shot and killed the opponent\u2019s younger brother, then smashed his skull with a rock.",
      "Prosecutors also allege that in 2008, Viliena and his allies went armed with guns, machetes, picks and sledgehammers to shut down a community radio station that he opposed. Authorities said he pistol-whipped and punched a man and ordered an associate to shoot and kill the man and another person.",
      "Both survived, but one of the men lost a leg and the other was blinded in one eye.",
      "Viliena was found liable by an American jury in a civil trial in 2023 in the killing and the two attempted killings and assessed $15.5 million in compensatory and punitive damages.",
      "The lawsuit was filed by the San Francisco-based Center for Justice and Accountability on behalf of David Boniface, Juders Ysem\u00e9 and Nissage Martyr in Boston in 2017. Nissage Martyr died and his son, Nissand\u00e8re Martyr, replaced him as a plaintiff.",
      "The lawsuit was filed under the Torture Victim Protection Act of 1991, which allows lawsuits to be filed in the U.S. against foreign officials over allegations of wrongdoing in their homeland if all legal avenues in their country have been exhausted.",
      "The center also called on the State Department, the U.S. Embassy in Haiti and the Inter-American Court of Human Rights to work with Haiti\u2019s government to ensure the safety of their clients and family members, who have been subjected to retaliation and intimidation.",
      "Jason Benzaken, lead counsel for Villena, said his client now \u201chas the opportunity to present evidence of his innocence.\u201d",
      "\u201cMr. Viliena is innocent of the charges against him and we are looking forward to the opportunity to prove this,\u201d Benzaken said.",
      "Boniface, Ysem\u00e9 and Martyr live in hiding and said in statements Wednesday that while pleased with Viliena\u2019s arrest, they are concerned about their families.",
      "Martyr\u2019s mother and sisters still live in Les Irois."
