      "Alec Baldwin says the year since his trial ended has been a lot better than the years before it",
      "SAN DIEGO -- SAN DIEGO (AP) \u2014 Alec Baldwin says the year since his trial suddenly ended with a dismissal has been far better than the few years that preceded it, and the affect that time has had on him has been \u201cimmeasurable.\u201d",
      "\u201cSomething as powerful as that happens in your life, you don\u2019t know how much it changes you,\u201d he said. \u201cI can\u2019t even tell you how different I am from three-and-a-half years ago. And what I want and what I don\u2019t want, and how I want to live my life and not live my life.\u201d",
      "The 67-year-old actor spoke to The Associated Press at San Diego's Comic-Con International, where he was part of a panel on 75 years of Charles Schulz's \u201cPeanuts,\u201d whose simplicity, existential philosophy and moral outlook have been very much on his mind.",
      "Baldwin spoke while a suited Snoopy character stood nearby after posing for photos with him.",
      "In a foreword Baldwin wrote for \u201cThe Complete Peanuts 1977-1978,\u201d he said while reading Schulz's newspaper comic strip every day as a child, he realized Charlie Brown, more than anyone, wanted the things he wanted.",
      "Chief among those wants are \u201cthe desire to have friends and the desire to hold your friends close to you.\u201d",
      "That hasn\u2019t changed in the years since.",
      "\u201cCome on, what man my age doesn\u2019t relate to Charlie Brown? If Charlie Brown was 67 years old, he\u2019d be me, but he wouldn\u2019t have been stupid enough to have seven (small) children,\u201d he said with a laugh.",
      "But he aspires to the qualities of a different character.",
      "\u201cLucy. I want to be Lucy. Lucy is in charge. She\u2019s got it all figured out,\u201d he said. \u201cShe pauses for a moment of self-awareness, but not too long.\u201d",
      "Baldwin said he admired Schulz's simple line drawings combined with the real circumstances of the characters, embodied by real children's voices when the animated holiday specials emerged in his childhood.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s so complicated and simple at the same time, which is what I think makes it beautiful,\u201d he said.",
      "And he admired Schulz's willingness to embrace melancholy, and deeper darknesses, in stories about inner struggle that needed no villains.",
      "\u201cA dog sitting on top of a dog house would have the same impact on you as, like, Nietzsche, he said,\u201d looking across the room at Snoopy. \u201cThey should have named the dog Nietzsche.\u201d",

      "With more than 20 top 10 singles in their native country, Golden Earring had more success at home than overseas. But they began to attract an underground following in the U.S. in the late 1960s and broke through commercially in 1973 with the worldwide hit \u201cRadar Love,\" which has been covered by U2, R.E.M. and hundreds of others and used on the soundtrack to \u201cBaby Driver,\u201d \u201cWayne's World 2\u201d and other films.",

      "Hulk Hogan has left an indelible mark on professional wrestling and pop culture",
      "Hulk Hogan\u2019s back had weakened, a failed early attempt at slamming all 525 pounds of Andre the Giant left the \u201cImmortal One\" unsteady as the World Wrestling Federation champion once more needed to rally to beat another of wrestling\u2019s baddest bad guys.",
      "Andre wrapped his tree-trunk arms around the champ and tried to wring the final breaths out of Hogan with a bear hug so tight that more than 90,000 fans in Detroit almost witnessed the final day of Hulkamania.",
      "But, wait!",
      "This was Hulk Hogan.",
      "Wrestling\u2019s biggest star had more late comebacks than fellow 1980s sports stars John Elway or Michael Jordan combined. Hogan had some gas left in the tank, some extra bite in those 24-inch pythons, and hammered away at Andre. One right hand, then another one, and another! Wrestling fans roared as they knew the bad news that was coming for Andre. Hogan fought back \u2014 much as he did against those 1980s baddies out of the Cold War or Iran \u2014 and finally body-slammed Andre the Giant. Hogan hit the hopes and delivered his famous leg drop on Andre\u2019s chest to get the three count.",
      "Hulk Hogan won again at WrestleMania.",
      "He always won, of course. It\u2019s what the story called for and there was no reason for WWF owner and pro wrestler puppeteer Vince McMahon to ever deviate from the plan of Hulkamania running wild.",
      "Why would he?",
      "Hogan had the hulking size, the charisma and catchphrases \u2014 \u201cWhat\u2019cha gonna do when Hulkamania runs wild on you?\u201d \u2014 that led the industry out of gyms and regional arenas and into NFL stadiums, like that 1987 night when Hogan beat Andre at the Pontiac Silverdome in WrestleMania III.",
      "\u201cThere he is,\u201d announcer Gorilla Monsoon said, as Hogan played to the crowd, \u201cthe greatest professional athlete in the world today.\u201d",
      "Whether you break out an eye roll or crank up Hogan\u2019s \u201c Real American \u201d anthem to that statement depends, of course, on one\u2019s ability to suspend disbelief. There is no denying, though, just how real Hogan\u2019s impact was on professional wrestling and pop culture in the 1980s. He stood toe-to-toe with Rocky Balboa. He fought side-by-side with Mr. T. He hosted \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d and flexed on the cover of Sports Illustrated.",
      "\u201cHe did what he set out to do,\u201d WWE Hall of Famer Sgt. Slaughter said Friday by phone. \u201cHe became the most recognized, not only professional wrestler and sports entertainer in the world, he\u2019s probably top-five of anybody you\u2019d recognize when you saw him.\u201d",
      "WWE has long claimed the paid attendance of WrestleMania III was 93,173, a number some historians claim is as artificially inflated as the chemically-enhanced biceps of that era. What can\u2019t be disputed, when the two had their match in 1988, live on national television, more than 33 million fans tuned in to NBC, still far and away the record for largest viewing audience in American televised wrestling.",
      "Making money and moving merch. That was the real power of Hulkamania.",
      "Hogan, who died Thursday in Florida at age 71, left behind more than three decades of memorable matches that captured the spirit of those little Hulkamaniacs to the ones that loved to hate him in the 1990s as \u201cHollywood\u201d Hulk Hogan in the New World Order.",
      "Here are some of his best moments.",
      "Hogan wasn\u2019t some upstart when he returned to the WWF (now WWE) in late 1983. He tested the waters of Hulkamania in the old American Wrestling Association and made his famous appearance as Thunderlips in \u201cRocky III,\u201d when was beckoned back to WWE and became an instant contender to face the champion, the hated Iron Sheik. Hogan broke out of the dreaded camel clutch and pinned the Sheik to become the new champion on Jan. 23, 1984, at Madison Square Garden \u2014 the building paid tribute to Hogan on Thursday night \u2014 and set the course for Hulkamania.",

      "He was champion for 1,474 days before losing to Andre in 1988.",
      "Back before the internet spilled behind-the-scenes secrets, and there was easy access to watch wrestling around the globe, WWE created its own version of wrestling history. If the company said Andre the Giant had never been slammed, and had never been pinned over a 15-year undefeated streak, then it was believed to be true (neither were, of course).",
      "Yet, the faux hype set the stage for the match that changed wrestling forever.",
      "\u201cAndre the Giant was a momentum-shifting moment where he passed his torch,\u201d Hogan said in a 2009 interview with the AP. \u201cHe was like the icing on the cake. Once he blessed me, it was up to me to mold that business and carry it through.\u201d",
      "By 1996, Hogan\u2019s good-guy, beats-the-odds character had grown stale as he made the shift from WWE to Ted Turner\u2019s World Championship Wrestling. Hogan even started to get booed as wrestling fans clamored for a new direction, a new star on top.",
      "They got one. \u201cHollywood\u201d Hulk Hogan.",
      "For weeks, two former WWE stars had \u201cinvaded\u201d WCW and claimed they were taking over the company. That led to a six-man tag-team match where the two outsiders, Kevin Nash and Scott Hall, promised a third man to help with their cause. No one showed to help the two until the end, when Hogan walked out in his red-and-yellow attire, and stunned the crowd when he put the leg drop on Randy Savage. Hogan was third man. He ditched his traditional colors for black-and-white, sunglasses, dark facial hair and embraced the \u201cHollywood\u201d heel persona.",
      "Much as he did a decade earlier, Hogan led WCW to new heights and the company would defeat WWE in the TV ratings for 83 straight weeks in what would be known as the \u201cMonday Night Wars.\u201d Hogan lost as much as he won without his Hulkamania powers. He still moved the needle where it mattered most and made WCW must-see TV every Monday night.",
      "With WCW out of business and bought by McMahon, Hogan kept a low profile until he made a comeback with WWE in 2002. He returned with Hall and Nash as the NWO but at this point, WWE fans wanted their old Hulkster back.",
      "Dwayne \u201cThe Rock\u201d Johnson was WWE\u2019s baby-faced crowd favorite when he met the villainous Hogan at WrestleMania in an \u201cIcon vs. Icon\u201d match in WrestleMania in 2002. One problem, the Toronto crowd decided to back Hogan.",
      "\u201cWhen we hit the ring, 70,000 loyal people didn\u2019t want to hate Hulk Hogan,\u201d Hogan said in 2009. \u201cEverybody kind of started to panic and I just said, \u2019Brother, stick with me and I\u2019ll get you through this.\u201d\u2019",
      "After the match, the cheers for Hogan called for a last-second change of plans, with his former NWO allies running down to attack him. The Rock helped Hogan fight off the NWO and the two men posed together to riotous cheers.",
      "\u201cAs I raised his hand and said he\u2019s the greatest wrestler in the world, they had to turn me back red and yellow immediately,\u201d Hogan said. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of interesting, that was going to be the nail in my coffin. It turned out to be the fountain of youth for me.\u201d",

      "Cleo Laine, whose husky contralto was one of the most distinctive voices in jazz and who was regarded by many as Britain\u2019s greatest contribution to the quintessentially American music, has died",
      "LONDON -- Cleo Laine, whose husky contralto was one of the most distinctive voices in jazz and who was regarded by many as Britain's greatest contribution to the quintessentially American music, has died. She was 97.",
      "The Stables, a charity and venue Laine founded with her late jazz musician husband John Dankworth, said Friday it was \u201cgreatly saddened\u201d by the news that \u201cone of its founders and Life President, Dame Cleo Laine has passed away.\"",
      "Monica Ferguson, artistic director of The Stables, said Laine \"will be greatly missed, but her unique talent will always be remembered.\u201d",
      "Laine's career spanned the Atlantic and crossed genres: She sang the songs of Kurt Weill, Arnold Schoenberg and Robert Schumann; she acted on stage and on film, and even played God in a production of Benjamin Britten's \"Noye's Fludde.\"",
      "Laine's life and art were intimately bound up with band leader Dankworth, who gave her a job and her stage name in 1951, and married her seven years later. Both were still performing after their 80th birthdays. Dankworth died in 2010 at 82.",
      "In 1997, Laine became the first British jazz artist to be made a dame, the female equivalent of a knight.",
      "\"It is British jazz that should have received the accolade for its service to me,\" she said when the honor was announced. \"It has given me a wonderful life, a successful career and an opportunity to travel the globe doing what I love to do.\"",
      "Laine was born Clementina Dinah Campbell in 1927. Her father, Alexander Campbell, was a Jamaican who loved opera and earned money during the Depression as a street singer. Despite hard times, her British mother, Minnie, made sure that her daughter had piano, voice and dance lessons.",
      "She began performing at local events at age 3, and at age 12 she got a role as a movie extra in \"The Thief of Bagdad.\" Leaving school at 14, Laine went to work as a hairdresser and faced repeated rejection in her efforts to get a job as a singer.",
      "A decade later, in 1951, she tried out for the Johnny Dankworth Seven, and succeeded. \"Clementina Campbell\" was judged too long for a marquee, so she became Cleo Laine.",
      "\"John said that when he heard me, I didn't sound like anyone else who was singing at the time,\" Laine once said. \"I guess the reason I didn't get the other jobs is that they were looking for a singer who did sound like somebody else.\"",
      "Laine had a remarkable range, from tenor to contralto, and a sound often described as \"smoky.\"",
      "Dankworth, in an interview with the Irish Independent, recalled Laine's audition.",
      "\"They were all sitting there with stony faces, so I asked the Scottish trumpet player Jimmy Deuchar, who was looking very glum and was the hardest nut of all, whether he thought she had something. 'Something?' he said, 'She's got everything!'\"",
      "Offered 6 pounds a week, Laine demanded \u2014 and got \u2014 7 pounds.",
      "\"They used to call me 'Scruff', although I don't think I was scruffy. It was just that having come from the sticks, I didn't know how to put things together as well as the other singers of the day,\" she told the Irish Independent. \"And anyway, I didn't have the money, because they weren't paying me enough.\"",
      "Recognition came swiftly. Laine was runner-up in Melody Maker's \"girl singer\" category in 1952, and topped the list in 1956 and 1957.",

      "The premiere also took aim at Paramount and its $16 million recent settlement with Trump just hours after Parker and Stone signed a five-year deal with the company for 50 new episodes and streaming rights to previous seasons.

      "NEW YORK -- MrBeast's new CEO hit Wall Street Wednesday as YouTuber Jimmy Donaldson's media empire looks to develop long-term brand partnerships and, in turn, unlock more funding for its charitable content.",
      "Venture capitalist Jeff Housenbold took over MrBeast leadership last summer with a mandate to professionalize an ever-growing entertainment company. YouTube's most popular creator had reached record audience levels far outpacing its startup days, while vowing to reassess its internal culture amid multiple controversies. But, despite joining Nasdaq's closing bell ceremony on Wednesday, Housenbold said their strategic plan does not currently include a public offering \u2014 or any active funding rounds.",
      "\u201cDo I want to make banger content? Yeah. That\u2019s cool,\" Housenbold told The Associated Press. \"But what can we do with that banger content? Generate profits, make a sustainable business that gives us greater ability to impact people\u2019s lives around the world.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re marching quickly to profitability, so we don\u2019t have to raise additional capital,\u201d he added.",
      "Instead, MrBeast is focused on securing multi-year exclusive advertising deals as opposed to single-video brand partnerships. With 416 million subscribers and legions of impressionable young fans, Housenbold argued that MrBeast is uniquely positioned to deliver more bang for companies' marketing bucks by pointing that \u201cfirehouse of attention\u201d at them.",
      "Along the way, Housenbold said he is encouraging Donaldson to tout the channel's charitable works \u2014 which often feature quantifiable stunts such as building wells, removing ocean plastic or covering cataract surgery costs. The company, in his view, \u201ccan do good while doing well.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe more people who like us \u2019cause we do good, the more people watch our videos,\" he said. \u201cThe more people watch our videos, the more we\u2019re able to drive in fees from our advertising partners... the more we can invest in more content to do more good in the world.\u201d",
      "New projects such as the Amazon Prime reality show and a James Patterson novel from HarperCollins aim to diversify the genders and ages of his audience. Housenbold said that base has historically consisted mostly of 8-to-25-year-olds and men.",
      "But Housenbold acknowledged missteps in last year's production of \u201cBeast Games,\" which prompted allegations of \u201cunsafe\u201d conditions from some contestants who said an unorganized set led to injuries, irregular food provision and lacking access to medication. While describing most of those reports as \u201cinaccurate,\u201d Housenbold said they were \u201cbetter prepared\u201d for the second season's recently wrapped shoot.",

      "Fleetwood Mac\u2019s Stevie Nicks and Lindsey Buckingham have announced the reissue of 1973's \u201cBuckingham Nicks.\u201d",
      "NEW YORK -- They're not going their own way anymore. After much speculation, Fleetwood Mac\u2019s Stevie Nicks and Lindsey Buckingham announced Wednesday the reissue of \u201cBuckingham Nicks,\u201d more than 50 years after the release of their only full-length album as a duo.",
      "Since its initial release in 1973, \u201cBuckingham Nicks\u201d has never been reissued and is not currently available on streaming platforms. The remastered version arrives Sept. 19 via Rhino Records' high-fidelity series and was sourced from the original analog master tapes. The album will also receive a CD and digital release for the first time, and the opening track, \u201cCrying in the Night,\u201d was available to stream Wednesday.",
      "Buckingham and Nicks were in their early to mid-20s during the making of their album. \u201cIt was a very natural thing, from the beginning,\u201d Nicks says in the re-release's liner notes, written by music journalist David Fricke.",
      "Despite their relative inexperience, \u201cit stands up in a way you would hope it would, by these two kids who were pretty young to be doing that work,\u201d Buckingham says, according to the announcement release.",
      "The reissue announcement was foreshadowed by cryptic Instagram posts last week. Both Nicks and Buckingham shared handwritten lyrics to their official social media accounts.",
      "\u201cAnd if you go forward\u2026\u201d Nicks posted, a line from their song \u201cFrozen Love,\u201d which appears on \u201cBuckingham Nicks.\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019ll meet you there,\u201d Buckingham shared, completing the lyric.",
      "In 2011, Buckingham told Uncut that he and Nicks had \u201cevery intention of putting that album back out and possibly even doing something along with it, but I can\u2019t put any specifics on that.\u201d In 2013, on the album\u2019s 40th anniversary, Fleetwood Mac released \u201cExtended Play,\u201d their first new studio material since 2003\u2019s \u201cSay You Will.\u201d The four-track collection featured a song titled \u201cWithout You,\u201d which had been originally slated for \u201cBuckingham Nicks.\u201d",
      "The reissued version of \u201cBuckingham Nicks\u201d features the same album cover as the original, despite Nicks' public dissatisfaction with the photograph, telling classic rock magazine MOJO that she \u201cfelt like a rat in a trap\u201d during the shoot.",

      "\u201cBuckingham Nicks\u201d was released one year before they joined Fleetwood Mac, and was met with little commercial success. But it did attract the attention of Mick Fleetwood, who invited Buckingham to join Fleetwood Mac. Buckingham in turn insisted Nicks come, too.

      "The pair\u2019s tumultuous relationship appeared across the band\u2019s discography: She wrote \u201cDreams\u201d about him. He wrote \u201cGo Your Own Way\u201d about her.

      "Buckingham left the band in 1987, returning in 1996. The last time the band reunited, however, for a 2018-2019 tour, the rest of the members kicked Buckingham out, and as a result, he sued them. He claimed he was told five days after the group appeared at Radio City Music Hall that the band would tour without him. He says he would have been paid at least $12 million for his share of the proceeds. Later that year, Buckingham said they had settled the lawsuit.",
      "Both Buckingham and Nicks have also released reams of solo music. Some fans had theorized that Nicks and Buckingham were teasing a Fleetwood Mac reunion, which would have been the first since the death of vocalist, songwriter and keyboard player Christine McVie in 2022.",
      "Last year, Nicks told MOJO that without McVie, \u201cthere is no chance of putting Fleetwood Mac back together in any way.\u201d",

      "UNITED NATIONS -- The Trump administration announced Tuesday that it will once again withdraw from the U.N. cultural agency UNESCO, an expected move that has the U.S. further retreating from international organizations.",
      "The decision to pull U.S. funding and participation from UNESCO comes two years after the Biden administration rejoined following a controversial, five-year absence that began during President Donald Trump\u2019s first term. The White House cited similar concerns as it did in 2018, saying it believes U.S. involvement is not in its national interest and accusing the agency of promoting anti-Israel speech.",
      "The decision, which won't go into effect until December 2026, will deal a blow to an agency known for preserving cultural heritage through its UNESCO World Heritage Sites program \u2014 which recognizes significant landmarks for protection, ranging from the Taj Mahal to Egypt's pyramids of Giza and the Grand Canyon National Park. The agency also empowers education and science across the globe.",
      "It is the Trump administration\u2019s latest move to pull support for U.N. agencies under a larger campaign to reshape U.S. diplomacy. Under the \"America First\" approach, the administration has pulled out of the U.N. World Health Organization and the top U.N. human rights body, while reassessing its funding for others. This has left the U.N., which is in the process of its own massive overhaul, reevaluating core programs and initiatives and what the international body would look like without support from the U.S. \u2014 its largest donor.",
      "State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce said in a statement that the withdrawal was linked to UNESCO\u2019s perceived agenda to \u201cadvance divisive social and cultural causes.\u201d",
      "She added that UNESCO\u2019s decision in 2011 \u201cto admit the \u2018State of Palestine\u2019 as a Member State is highly problematic, contrary to U.S. policy, and contributed to the proliferation of anti-Israel rhetoric within the organization.\u201d",
      "UNESCO director general Audrey Azoulay said she \u201cdeeply\u201d regrets the U.S. decision but said it was expected and that the agency \u201chas prepared for it.\u201d She also denied accusations of anti-Israel bias, saying it contradicts \u201cthe reality of UNESCO\u2019s efforts, particularly in the field of Holocaust education and the fight against antisemitism.\u201d",
      "Azoulay added that \u201cthe reasons put forward by the United States of America are the same as seven years ago, even though the situation has changed profoundly, political tensions have receded, and UNESCO today constitutes a rare forum for consensus on concrete and action-oriented multilateralism.\"",
      "Danny Danon, Israel's ambassador to the U.N., celebrated the announcement, saying in a statement that it is a \u201cfitting response to the consistent misguided anti-Israel bias of UNESCO, an organization that has lost its way.\u201d",
      "The Biden administration had rejoined UNESCO in 2023 after citing concerns that China was filling the gap left by the U.S. in UNESCO policymaking, notably in setting standards for artificial intelligence and technology education.",
      "\u201cUnilaterally withdrawing the United States from UNESCO is another assault by the Trump administration on international cooperation and U.S. global leadership,\" Rep. Gregory Meeks, the top Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said.",

While the U.S. had previously provided a notable share of the agency\u2019s budget, UNESCO has diversified its funding sources in recent years as the U.S. contribution has decreased. Today, American assistance represents only 8% of the agency\u2019s total budget.",

      "\u201cWe\u2019re sending our furry child out into the world and you are the custodian of it. Now, please be careful with our child,\u201d Oliver said a couple of hours before the Moon Mammoths took the field against the Chesapeake Oyster Catchers.",
      "Oliver spotlighted Minor League Baseball promotions and alternate nicknames during \u201cLast Week Tonight\u201d on May 4. At the end of the segment, Oliver invited teams to send in proposals on why they should get rebranded by the show's staff.",
      "Forty-seven teams sent in pitches, including the Erie SeaWolves, the Double-A affiliate of the Detroit Tigers.",
      "Erie president Greg Coleman sent a list of 11 reasons why they were the perfect candidate, including: \u201cThe SeaWolves play baseball nowhere near the sea.\u201d",

We thought this would be a group of people that would respond to the ludicrous idea that we had,\u201d Oliver said.",
      "Erie was announced as the winner on May 18. After six weeks of research by Oliver and his staff, the Moon Mammoths were unveiled on June 29. That included the mascot named Fuzz, a purple woolly mammoth wearing a space helmet.",
      "\u201cErie did stand out to us as being, you know, uniquely eccentric. And I say that as both a compliment and an insult, which is the biggest compliment there is,\" Oliver said. \u201cThere was something about the Moon Mammoth that spoke to us for being particularly odd.

That\u2019s a bad decision, and it\u2019s that kind of bad decision making that I love about minor league baseball.\u201d",

      "Dr. Salvador Plasencia would be the fourth of five people charged in connection with Perry's death to plead guilty.",

      "He had previously pleaded not guilty, but in exchange for the guilty pleas prosecutors have agreed to drop three additional counts of distribution of ketamine and two counts of falsifying records.",
      "Plasencia's attorneys emphasized in an email after he reached his agreement that he \u201cwas not treating Matthew Perry at the time of his death and the ketamine that caused Mr. Perry\u2019s death was not provided by Dr. Plasencia.\u201d",
      "The remaining charges can carry a maximum sentence of 40 years in prison, and there is no guarantee he'll get less, but he's likely to. Plasencia has been free on bond since shortly after his arrest in August. He will not be sentenced until a future hearing.",
      "The only remaining defendant who has not reached an agreement with the U.S. Attorney's Office is Jasveen Sangha, who prosecutors allege is a drug dealer known as the \u201cKetamine Queen\u201d and sold Perry the lethal dose. Her trial is scheduled to begin next month. She has pleaded not guilty.",
      "According to prosecutors and co-defendants who reached their own deals, Plasencia illegally supplied Perry with a large amount of ketamine starting about a month before his death on Oct. 28, 2023.",
      "According to a co-defendant, Plasencia in a text message called the actor a \u201cmoron\u201d who could be exploited for money.",

      "The larger-than-life frontman of the pioneering heavy metal band Black Sabbath Ozzy Osbourne has died",
      "NEW YORK -- There are pioneering music figures, and then there is Ozzy Osbourne, the larger-than-life frontman of Black Sabbath, whose personal mythology is eclipsed only by the strength and immortality of his songs.",
      "A godfather and force of heavy metal, Osbourne died Tuesday at 76, just weeks after his last performance.",
      "The English icon's idiosyncratic, throaty voice launched generations of metalheads, both through his work at the reins of Black Sabbath and in his solo career. Across his repertoire, there are songs with total global ubiquity and lesser-known innovations with his unique, spooky aesthetic quality.",
      "To celebrate Osbourne\u2019s life and legacy, we've selected just a few songs that made the man, from timeless tunes to a few left-of-center selections.",
      "Read on and then listen to all of the tracks on our Spotify playlist.",
      "It would be a challenge to name a more immediately recognizable guitar riff than the one that launches Black Sabbath's 1970 megahit \u201cIron Man.\u201d It transcends the metal genre \u2014 an all-timer heard around the world and in guitar stores everywhere.",
      "One of the great Vietnam War protest songs, Black Sabbath's \u201cWar Pigs\u201d is a rare moment where hippies and metalheads can agree: \u201cPoliticians hide themselves away / They only started the war / Why should they go out to fight?\u201d Osbourne sings in the bridge.",
      "Osbourne's heaviest performances are at least partially indebted to Black Sabbath's bassist and lyricist Terry \u201cGeezer\u201d Butler, and there is perhaps no better example than \u201cChildren of the Grave,\u201d the single from the band's 1971 album, \u201cMaster of Reality.\u201d \u201cMust the world live in the shadow of atomic fear?\u201d Osbourne embodies Butler's words, a sonic fist lifted in the air. \u201cCan they win the fight for peace or will they disappear?\u201d",
      "Black Sabbath were in a creative rut in the time period leading up to \u201cSabbath Bloody Sabbath,\u201d the opening track from their 1973 album of the same name. It's almost hard to believe now \u2014 the song features one of their best-known riffs, and its chorus features some truly ascendant vocals.",

      "Another classic cut from Osbourne's debut solo album, \u201cBlizzard Of Ozz\u201d \u2014 released one year after Osbourne was fired from Black Sabbath for his legendary excesses, \u2014 the arena rock anthem \u201cMr. Crowley\u201d pays tribute to the famed English occultist Aleister Crowley and features Deep Purple's Don Airey on keyboard.",
      "The title track and coda of Osbourne's second solo studio album, \u201cDiary of a Madman,\u201d runs over six minutes long, features big strings and a choir so theatrical it sounds like they're scoring a medieval war film. He wanted big, he wanted dramatic, and he nailed it.",
      "It wouldn't be inaccurate to call \u201cMama, I'm Coming Home\u201d a beautiful-sounding song. It's unlike anything on this list, a power ballad featuring lyrics written by the late Mot\u00f6rhead frontman Lemmy and a welcomed deviation.",
      "When Black Sabbath comes to mind, most fans jump to an unimpeachable run of albums released in the '70s and early \u201980s. But \u201cI,\u201d a cut from Black Sabbath's too often overlooked 16th studio album, \u201cDehumanizer,\u201d is worth your ear. And not only because it is the first Sabbath album to feature singer Ronnie James Dio and drummer Vinny Appice since 1981's \u201cMob Rules,\u201d though that's an obvious plus.",
      "Late in life Ozzy Osbourne was generous with his time and talent, often collaborating with younger performers who idolized the metal legend. One such example is Post Malone's \u201cTake What You Want,\u201d which also features the rapper Travis Scott. Osbourne gives the song a necessary gothic edge \u2014 validating the otherwise balladic song's use of a sprightly guitar solo.",

      "The NBA Summer League in Las Vegas has become more than just basketball",
      "LAS VEGAS -- While Bronny James and other young talent were lighting up the NBA Summer League court in Las Vegas, another game was being played just a few steps away: One with scripts, storyboards and studio buzz.",
      "Inside the Thomas & Mack Center, just as the league wrapped up Sunday, a different kind of crowd formed. Hollywood execs, producers and curious power players were slipping away from the basketball action to catch a slate of 34 film projects created by NBA stars past and present.",
      "More than just film screenings, it\u2019s an emerging playground where sports and the art of storytelling collide. From baseline to backlot, the Summer League Film Festival is generating off-court buzz \u2014 with the likes of Hall of Famer Kevin Garnett, actor-producer Mark Wahlberg and filmmaker Deon Taylor joining the mix. Conversations are building on turning this three-day showcase into a launchpad for athlete-filmmakers, backed by film industry veterans who understand both the creative and business sides of shaping ideas and grooming projects for the screen.",
      "\u201cThis definitely has legs,\u201d said retired NBA player Stacey Augmon after previewing \u201cUNLV: Kings of Vegas,\u201d a documentary chronicling the untold story of the Runnin\u2019 Rebels in the Strip View Pavilion. A 10-minute clip was screened before a packed audience, including Sundance Film Festival director Michelle Satter and production companies like the Wahlberg co-owned Unrealistic Ideas and Alcon Entertainment, the company behind \u201cThe Book of Eli\u201d and \u201cBlade Runner 2049.\u201d",
      "Like other entries, the \u201cKings of Vegas\u201d team showcased select footage, including interviews with high-profile names such as Snoop Dogg, Chuck D and Jimmy Kimmel, alongside UNLV legends Augmon, Larry Johnson, Greg Anthony and others. After the screening, the producers and cast discussed the film\u2019s origins, drawing a standing ovation from the crowd.",
      "The documentary remains in development, but Augmon says the film festival is already proving its worth.",
      "\u201cThis gives us another great avenue,\u201d said Augmon, who played on the Runnin' Rebels team that won the 1990 NCAA championship before his 15-season NBA career. His college teammate, Anderson Hunt, said sharing their authentic, real-life stories offer a major advantage like never before, unlocking new pathways to getting their projects financed and sold.",
      "\u201cWe have control of what's coming out,\u201d Hunt said. \u201cPeople might know about our stories through the internet. But stuff like this takes our platform to the next level. This is great for us, and Deon is like a golden child.\u201d",
      "The festival spotlighted stories produced by NBA stars past and present including Nikola Jokic, Luguentz Dort, Tony Allen, Nate Robinson, Kyle Anderson, Cole Anthony, Keyon Dooling and Udonis Haslem.",
      "Deon and Roxanne Avent Taylor of Hidden Empire Film Group were tapped to infuse the festival with seasoned filmmaking expertise, helping bridge the worlds of sports and entertainment. He played a key role in encouraging Hollywood insiders to show up, especially during the NBA Summer League's final stretch to keep the closing days as enticing as opening week.",
      "Taylor credited NBA Summer League co-founder Albert Hall for having the foresight to spark the collaboration.",
      "\u201cThis is all invaluable,\u201d said Hall, who cofounded the league with Warren LeGarie in 2004. \u201cThe players make money, no doubt about it. They invest in these projects. But they don\u2019t really know what the system can provide or how to approach it. Kind of like a young executive getting into the sport or a young player trying to be seen and get exposure. It\u2019s the same way. They have to be coached up.\u201d",
      "Hall said the partnership with Hidden Empire was a natural next step following their successful collaboration with the NFL and Skydance Sports, where they led film training sessions in March for more than 20 current and former NFL players. He added that having Wahlberg and Archie Gips of Unrealistic Ideas on board brings more industry muscle to strengthen the initiative and help drive it forward.",

You can do that if you've lived and experienced it. You can't do that from a high-rise building with no pain. These guys come from adversity in life and sports.\u201d",
      "EverWonder Studio president Michael Antinoro certainly thinks so, and then some. He sees the film festival as more than a one-off spectacle in Las Vegas.",

      "\u201cIf we can add any value, we\u2019re in the rooms talking to all the networks and streamers that distributes films,\u201d said Antinoro, a founding partner of the studio, which specializes in nonfiction content, documentaries and live events. The company served as co-executive producer on \u201cDefiant: The Manny Pacquiao Obsession\u201d in 2019 and produced projects featuring Mike Tyson and Brett Favre.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re talking to them a lot. It\u2019s all about exposure,\u201d he said. \u201cSome of these films maybe need a little more money just to get them over the line. If it makes sense, we can play a little there too.\u201d",
      "For Michelle Satter, it\u2019s all about fostering a supportive creative community. She sees promising potential in what\u2019s taking shape at the Summer League Film Festival.",
      "While it\u2019s still early, Satter can envision a future where projects from the festival eventually find their way into Sundance.",
      "\u201cWhy not? Of course,\u201d said Satter, a founding figure at Sundance since 1981. She now serves as the founding senior director of Sundance Institute's artist programs. She's exploring how it might support the festival after being invited by Taylor.",
      "Sundance already has an existing partnership with Taylor\u2019s Hidden Empire. She called the opportunity to collaborate on this new venture both exciting and aligned with Sundance\u2019s mission to uplift emerging voices in storytelling.",
      "Satter's late son, Michael Latt, had his documentary short \u201cHoops, Hopes & Dreams\u201d premiere at Sundance early this year. She said Sundance gets about 15,000 short film submissions each year, but there\u2019s room for compelling storytelling that opens up new perspective from an athlete\u2019s lens.",

      "But the state has a blind spot when it comes to the hundreds of thousands of people who live in its mobile home parks.",
      "Regulators say they have little power to enforce the rules in the state's estimated 100 or more unlicensed parks when owners fail to provide safe water. The problem is compounded by private equity firms that have been buying up parks over the past two decades and now control about 1 in every 6 parks in Michigan \u2014 among the highest rates in the country, according to the Private Equity Stakeholder Project, a group that advocates against such purchases.",
      "Officials say it can be a struggle to even contact those park owners, let alone get them to comply with regulations.",
      "\u201cWith private equity moving into this space, the goal these companies seem to have is to return the absolute highest return they can to investors even if that means providing inadequate service or engaging in exploitative practices, or unsafe practices for the residents,\u201d said state Sen. John Cherry, a Democrat who sponsored legislation to strengthen enforcement in the communities.",
      "But the state doesn't attempt to track unlicensed parks. And an industry spokesperson said Michigan officials \u2014 particularly law enforcement \u2014 have the power to do more if they choose.",
      "At North Morris Estates where Theo Gantos lives outside Flint, conditions got so bad that the state refused to renew the park\u2019s license to operate.",
      "Water often flowed weakly from the tap because the wells that service the park didn\u2019t produce enough, Gantos said. Sometimes the water was discolored. It could stain laundry and destroy appliances. He installed a multistage filter system just to be able to use it.",
      "Eventually, local law enforcement investigated. In March, the owner pleaded guilty to a criminal charge for operating without a license, agreeing to pay a fine and sell the park.",
      "That might not have happened if Gantos had not been so pugnacious. He spent years battling Homes of America, an affiliate of private equity group Alden Global Capital that local prosecutors said owns North Morris. That included filing a public records request for emails on officials\u2019 handling of problems at his park, pushing regulators to enforce rules and speaking out to media over what he calls blight conditions.",
      "\u201cThese guys, they don\u2019t care,\u201d Gantos said about complying with the rules.",
      "Representatives of North Morris and Homes of America, including an attorney who appeared for the park in legal proceedings, did not respond to messages seeking comment.",
      "The Michigan Department of Licensing and Regulatory Affairs, called LARA, has the authority to inspect and investigate complaints at licensed mobile home parks. But it\u2019s typically fallen to law enforcement to pursue criminal charges against unlicensed parks.",
      "The North Morris conviction for operating without a license is likely the first such under the state\u2019s mobile home law that has been on the books since 1987, the county prosecutor said.",

And what we\u2019ve seen so far with both the state and local units of government is they\u2019ve elected not to.\u201d",
      "Mobile home parks without a license are \u201cessentially operating unregulated,\u201d Cherry said. One of the state\u2019s few options is to shut down a park, a rarely used last resort that can mean throwing people out of their homes.",
      "Mobile home parks have long been an important affordable housing option. But that affordability is fading.",
      "A study by Lending Tree, a lending marketplace, found new mobile home sale prices rose more than 50% nationally from 2018 to 2023 \u2014 new single-family home price averages, by contrast, rose 38% over that period.",
      "Last year, LARA supported legislation that would have given the department more power to penalize unlicensed parks, force parks to provide owner contact information and limit rent increases. That failed.",
      "This year, Democratic Sen. Jeff Irwin has proposed a narrower law that would give state drinking water officials more power to make sure water in all mobile home parks is drinkable. Right now, they only have direct authority over parks that provide their own water. But it\u2019s common for parks to take city water from a pipe connecting to the nearby town.",
      "That water is usually safe when it reaches the park, but if the park\u2019s water pipes crack or fail, water protections won\u2019t apply on the private property. That keeps officials from stepping in and forcing change except in limited situations when there\u2019s a public health threat. It can leave residents unsure where to turn when the owner refuses to fix problems.",
      "\u201cWe take those issues very seriously,\u201d said Eric Oswald, director of the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy\u2019s drinking water and environmental health division. He said they try to work with licensing officials to ensure water is safe, though \u201cthe problem is, I\u2019m not resourced for that.\u201d",
      "The Michigan Manufactured Housing Association opposed last year\u2019s legislation, arguing it would make mobile homes less affordable. The group says it supports extending water protections to within parks, as called for in this year\u2019s legislation. It passed the state Senate in late June and is now in the GOP-controlled House.",

      "The European Medicines Agency has recommended authorizing a twice-yearly injectable drug to prevent HIV",
      "LONDON -- The European Medicines Agency has recommended authorizing a twice-yearly injectable drug aimed at preventing HIV, which scientists say could help end the virus' transmission.",
      "In a statement on Friday, the EU drug regulator said its evaluations of lenacapavir, sold as Yeytuo in Europe by Gilead Sciences, showed the drug is \u201chighly effective\u201d and \u201cconsidered to be of major public health interest.\u201d Once the regulator's guidance is accepted by the European Commission, the authorization is valid in all 27 EU member countries as well as Iceland, Norway and Liechtenstein.",

Other medication aimed at preventing HIV include daily pills that people can take and another injectable drug called cabotegravir, which is given every two months.

      "Millions of people living in mobile home parks don't enjoy the same drinking water protections that Americans are accustomed to",
      "The worst water Colt Smith has seen in 14 years with Utah\u2019s Division of Drinking Water was at a mobile home park, where residents had been drinking it for years before state officials discovered the contamination.",
      "The well water carried cancer-causing arsenic as much as 10 times the federal limit. Smith had to put the rural park under a do-not-drink order that lasted nearly 10 years.",
      "\u201cThe Health Department refers it to us like ... \u2018Why aren\u2019t you guys regulating it?\u2019 We had no idea it existed,\u201d he said.",
      "More than 50 years after the Safe Drinking Water Act was passed to ensure that Americans\u2019 water is free from harmful bacteria, lead and other dangerous substances, millions of people living in mobile home parks can\u2019t always count on those basic protections.",
      "A review by The Associated Press found that nearly 70% of mobile home parks running their own water systems violated safe drinking water rules in the past five years, a higher rate than utilities that supply water for cities and towns, according to Environmental Protection Agency data. And the problems are likely even bigger because the EPA database doesn\u2019t catch all parks.",
      "Even where parks get water from an outside source \u2014 such as a city \u2014 the clean water coming in can become contaminated if it passes through problematic infrastructure before reaching residents' taps. Because the EPA doesn\u2019t generally require this water to be tested and regulated, the problems may go unseen.",
      "Utah is one of the few states to step in with their own rules, according to an AP survey of state policies.",
      "\u201cIf you look back at the history of the Safe Drinking Water Act, like in the \u201970s when they were starting, it was, \u2018Well, as long as the source \u2026 is protected, then by the time it gets to the tap, it\u2019ll be fine.\u2019 And that\u2019s just not how it works,\u201d Smith said.",
      "In one Colorado mobile home park, raw sewage backed up into a bathtub. In a Michigan park, the taps often ran dry and the water resembled tea; in Iowa, it looked like coffee \u2014 scaring residents off drinking it and ruining laundry they could hardly afford to replace. In California, boxes of bottled water crowd a family's kitchen over fears of arsenic.",
      "Almost 17 million people in the U.S. live in mobile homes. Some are comfortable Sun Belt retirees. Many others have modest incomes and see mobile homes as a rare opportunity for home ownership.",
      "To understand how water in the parks can be so troubled, it\u2019s useful to remember that residents often own their homes but rent the land they sit on. Despite the name, it's difficult and expensive to move a mobile home. That means they\u2019re \u201chalfway homeowners,\u201d said Esther Sullivan, a professor of sociology at the University of Colorado in Denver who lived in several mobile home parks as she researched a book. Residents often put up with \u201creally egregious\u201d property maintenance by landlords because all their money is tied up in their home, she said.",
      "Pamela Maxey, 51, of Kalamazoo, Michigan, said she had forgotten what it was like to have reliable, clean water until she traveled to her state Capitol last year to advocate for better mobile home park protections and stayed in a hotel. By then, she had spent eight years in a park where sewage backed up into homes and the flow of tap water was sometimes weak or discolored.",
      "\u201cIt wasn\u2019t until I went into the bathroom to take a shower that I realized, \u2018I don\u2019t have to jump in here and squint my eyes closed the entire time and make sure water doesn\u2019t get in my mouth because I don\u2019t know what\u2019s in it,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cI went to brush my teeth, and I just turned the faucet on and I brushed my teeth from the water coming from the faucet. I haven\u2019t been able to do that for over a year.\u201d",
      "Victoria Silva, a premed student in Fort Collins, Colorado, estimates the water in Harmony Village Mobile Home Park where Silva lives went out or lost pressure 20 to 30 times over roughly three years there.",
      "\u201cPeople don\u2019t realize how much water they need until the water is out for five minutes when they need to flush, when they need to rinse something off their hands, when they need to make some pasta,\u201d Silva said.",
      "The park's owner says a licensed professional ensures water is maintained and tested, and outages are minimized.",
      "The U.S. has some 50,000 water utilities, most serving small towns and rural areas. Many struggle to find expert staff and funding, and they violate clean water rules more often than the handful of large utilities that serve cities. But even among the hard-pressed small utilities, mobile home parks stand out.",
      "The AP analysis found that more than half these parks failed to perform a required test for at least one contaminant, or failed to properly report the results, in the past five years. And they are far more likely to be repeat offenders of safe drinking water rules overall.",
      "But that's only part of the story. The true rates of mobile home park violations aren\u2019t knowable because the EPA doesn\u2019t track them well. The agency\u2019s tap water violation database depends on information from states that often don\u2019t properly categorize mobile home parks.",
      "When Smith first searched Utah\u2019s database in response to an AP request for data from all 50 states, he found only four small water systems identified as belonging to mobile home parks. With some keyword searches, he identified 33 more.",

      "The water in these other parks had been off their radar. At some, testing found high levels of cancer-causing arsenic in the water that had been provided to residents for years.",
      "It\u2019s impossible to know how many unnoticed parks are out there. Most states aren\u2019t actively looking for them and say they find very few. In Colorado, after the state passed a new law to require water testing at all mobile home parks, officials uncovered 79 parks with their source of water unknown. That\u2019s about a tenth of the total parks in the state.",
      "Many parks are decades old with aging pipes that can cause chronic water problems, even if the water that supplies the park is clean when it enters the system.",
      "Jake Freeman, the engineering director at Central States Water Resources, a Missouri-based private utility company that specializes in taking over small water systems in 11 states, said substandard and poorly installed pipes are more common to see in mobile home parks.",
      "\u201cA lot of times, it\u2019s hard to find the piping in the mobile home parks because if there\u2019s any kind of obstruction, they just go around it,\u201d he said. \u201d\u201cIt\u2019s like spaghetti laying in the ground.\u201d",
      "After a major winter storm devastated Texas in 2021, Freeman said, the company found pipes at parks it had taken over that \u201cwere barely buried. Some of them weren\u2019t buried.\u201d",
      "When pipes break and leak, the pressure drops and contaminants can enter water lines. In addition, parks sometimes have stagnant water \u2014 where pipes dead-end or water sits unused \u2014 that increases the risk of bacterial growth.",
      "Rebecca Sadosky is public water supply chief in North Carolina, where mobile home communities make up close to 40% of all water systems. She said owners don\u2019t always realize when they buy a park that they could also be running a mini utility.",
      "\u201cI think they don\u2019t know that they\u2019re getting into the water business,\u201d she said.",
      "Utah is a rare state that enforces safe drinking water standards even within mobile home parks that get their water from another provider, according to AP\u2019s survey of states. A small number of other states like New Hampshire have taken some steps to address water safety in these parks, but in most states frustrated residents may have no one to turn to for help beyond the park owner.",
      "In Colorado, when Silva asked officials who enforces safe drinking water rules, \u201cI just couldn\u2019t get clear answers.\u201d",
      "Steve Via, director of federal regulations at the American Water Works Association utility group, argued against regulating mobile home parks that get their water from a municipality, saying that would further stretch an already taxed oversight system. And if those parks are regulated, what\u2019s to stop the rules from extending to the privately owned pipes in big apartment buildings \u2014 the line has to be drawn somewhere, he said.",
      "Via said residents of parks where an owner refuses to fix water problems have options, including going to their local health departments, suing or complaining publicly.",
      "Silva is among the advocates who fought for years to change Colorado\u2019s rules before they succeeded in passing a law in 2023 that requires water testing in every mobile home park. It gives health officials the ability to go beyond federal law to address taste, color and smell that can make people afraid to drink their water, even when it\u2019s not a health risk. The state is now a leader in protecting mobile home park tap water.",
      "Smith, the Utah environmental scientist, said stopping the contaminated water flowing into the mobile home park and connecting it to a safe supply felt like a career highlight.",
      "He said Utah's culture of making do with scarce water contributed to a willingness for stronger testing and regulations than the federal government requires.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s sort of the communal nature of like, everybody should have access to clean water,\u201d he said. \u201cIt seems to transcend political ideologies; it seems to transcend religious ideologies.\u201d",

It gradually rose to 2.1 in 2007 before falling again, aside from a 2014 uptick. The rate in 2023 was 1.621, and inched down in 2024 to 1.599, according to the CDC's National Center for Health Statistics.",
      "Birth rates are generally declining for women in most age groups \u2014 and that doesn\u2019t seem likely to change in the near future, said Karen Guzzo, director of the Carolina Population Center at the University of North Carolina.",

      "That brought the yearly national total to just over 3.6 million babies born.",
      "But this is different: The provisional data indicated birth rate increases last year for women in their late 20s and 30s. However, the new report found birth rate declines for women in their 20s and early 30s, and no change for women in their late 30s.",
      "What happened? CDC officials said it was due to recalculations stemming from a change in the U.S. Census population estimates used to compute the birth rate.",
      "That's plausible, Root said. As the total population of women of childbearing age grew due to immigration, it offset small increases in births to women in those age groups, she said.",

      "The U.S. is developing new safeguards for the organ transplant system after a government investigation found a Kentucky group continued preparations for donation by some patients who showed signs of life",
      "WASHINGTON -- The U.S. is developing new safeguards for the organ transplant system after a government investigation found a Kentucky group continued preparations for organ donation by some patients who showed signs of life, officials told Congress Tuesday.",
      "While the organ removals were canceled, near misses that some lawmakers called horrifying should never happen. A House subcommittee asked how to repair trust in the transplant network for potential organ donors and families -- some of whom have opted out of donor registries after these cases were publicized.",
      "\u201cWe have to get this right,\u201d said Rep. Brett Guthrie, a Kentucky Republican who chairs the Energy and Commerce Committee and whose mother died waiting for a liver transplant.",
      "\u201cHopefully people will walk away today knowing we need to address issues but still confident that they can give life,\u201d Guthrie said, adding that he will remain a registered organ donor.",
      "The hearing came after a federal investigation began last fall into allegations that a Kentucky donation group pressured a hospital in 2021 to proceed with plans to withdraw life support and retrieve organs from a man despite signs that he might be waking up from his drug overdose. That surgery never happened after a doctor noticed him moving and moaning while being transported to the operating room \u2014 and the man survived.",
      "Lawmakers stressed most organ donations proceed appropriately and save tens of thousands of lives a year. But the federal probe \u2013 concluded in March but only made public ahead of Tuesday\u2019s hearing -- cited a \u201cconcerning pattern of risk\u201d in dozens of other cases involving the Kentucky group's initial planning to recover someone's organs.",
      "The report said some should have been stopped or reassessed earlier, and mostly involved small or rural hospitals with less experience in caring for potential organ donors.",
      "The Kentucky organ procurement organization, or OPO, has made changes and the national transplant network is working on additional steps. But notably absent Tuesday was any testimony from hospitals \u2013 whose doctors must independently determine a patient is dead before donation groups are allowed to retrieve organs.",
      "Here's a look at how the nation's transplant system works.",
      "More than 100,000 people are on the U.S. transplant list and about 13 a day die waiting, according to the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network.",
      "Only about 1% of deaths occur in a way that allows someone to even be considered for organ donation. Most people declared dead in a hospital will quickly be transferred to a funeral home or morgue instead.",
      "Several groups are involved in every transplant: the hospital caring for someone dead or dying; the 55 OPOs that coordinate recovery of organs and help match them to patients on the waiting list; and transplant centers that decide if an organ is the right fit for their patients.",
      "Adding to the complexity, two government agencies \u2014 HRSA, the Health Resources and Services Administration, and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services \u2014 share regulatory oversight of different parts of the donation and transplant process.",
      "Most organ donors are brain-dead \u2013 when testing determines someone has no brain function after a catastrophic injury. The body is left on a ventilator to support the organs until they can be retrieved.",

      "Hospitals are required to alert their area OPO to every potential donor who is declared brain-dead or once the decision to withdraw life support is made. The OPOs by law can't participate in that decision and \"we are not even in the room at that time,\u201d said Barry Massa of Kentucky's Network for Hope.",
      "During the following days of preparation, hospital employees continue caring for the patient \u2013 while the donation team talks with the family about the process, gathers hospital records showing the patient is eligible, requests tests of organ quality, and make arrangements with transplant centers to use them.",
      "Once the hospital withdraws life support and the heart stops beating there\u2019s a mandatory wait \u2013 five minutes \u2013 to be sure it won\u2019t restart. When the doctor declares death, the organ retrieval process can begin.",
      "Organs are only considered usable if death occurs relatively quickly, usually up to about two hours. Sometimes that takes much longer and thus the organs can\u2019t be used \u2013 and HRSA\u2019s Dr. Raymond Lynch told Congress that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean anything was done wrong. Still, he said HRSA is investigating reports of possible mistakes elsewhere.",
      "\u201cThis is a technically demanding form of care\u201d that requires \u201cgood collaboration between the OPO and the hospital,\u201d he said.",
      "At issue is how doctors are sure when it\u2019s time to withdraw life support from a dying patient \u2014 and the delicate balance of how OPOs interact with hospital staff in preparing for donation once death occurs.",
      "In May, HRSA quietly ordered the U.S. transplant network to oversee improvements at the Kentucky OPO and to develop new national policies making clear that anyone \u2013 family, hospital staff or organ donation staff \u2013 can call for a pause in donation preparations any time there are concerns about the patient\u2019s eligibility.",
      "Lynch said the government now wants more proactive collaboration from OPOs to give hospital staff \u201ca clear understanding\u201d of when to at least temporarily halt and reevaluate a potential donor if their health status changes.",
      "Kentucky's Massa said his group only received HRSA\u2019s reports this week \u2013 but that after learning about last fall\u2019s allegations, it made some changes. Massa said every hospital doctor and nurse now gets a checklist on caring for potential donors and how to pause when concerns are raised \u2014 and anyone can anonymously report complaints.",

      "BEIRUT -- Ziad Rahbani, a visionary Lebanese composer, playwright, pianist and political provocateur, died on Saturday, at the age of 69, according to the state-run National News Agency.",
      "The death was confirmed by a person close to Rahbani who spoke on condition of anonymity. The cause of death was not immediately clear.",
      "Born in 1956 in Antelias, near Beirut, Ziad was the eldest son of legendary Lebanese singer Fayrouz and late composer Assi Rahbani, one half of the famed Rahbani Brothers. From a young age, he showed signs of prodigious talent, composing his first musical work at just 17 years old. Raised among artistic royalty, his world was steeped in music, theater, and political consciousness \u2014 a combination that would define his life\u2019s work.",
      "His mother, considered to be the most famous and esteemed performer in the Arab world, performed some of his compositions at her sellout concerts, blending Lebanese folklore with Western syncopation and phrasing.",
      "Lebanese President Joseph Aoun mourned Rahbani\u2019s death as a national loss, describing him as \u201cnot just an artist, but a complete intellectual and cultural phenomenon.\u201d In a statement, Aoun praised Rahbani as \u201ca living conscience, a rebellious voice against injustice, and an honest mirror reflecting the suffering and marginalized.\u201d",
      "He highlighted how Rahbani\u2019s fusion of classical, jazz and Oriental music \u201copened new windows for Lebanese cultural expression\u201d and elevated it to global levels. \u201cZiad was a natural extension of the Rahbani family, which gave Lebanon much beauty and dignity,\u201d the president added.",
      "While his parents helped construct a golden era of Lebanese musical theater steeped in idealism and nostalgia, Rahbani charged onto the scene with irreverent satire, unflinching political critique and jazz-inflected scores that mirrored the chaos and contradictions of a Lebanon at war with itself.",
      "\u201cI admire the music of composers like Charlie Parker, Stan Getz and Dizzy Gillespie,\u201d he once said. \u201cBut my music is not Western, it\u2019s Lebanese, with a different way of expression.\u201d",
      "Rahbani\u2019s music reflected the hybrid heritage of Lebanon, which until the civil war erupted in 1975 was a cultural melting pot where East met West. But it was also deeply rooted in the traumatic events of the sectarian strife, the bloody street battles between rival militias and three years of violent Israeli occupation after the 1982 invasion.",
      "His breakout play, Nazl el-Sourour (Happiness Hotel), premiered in 1974 when he was only 17 and portrayed a society disfigured by class inequality and repression. The tragicomic narrative follows a group of workers who hijack a restaurant to demand their rights, only to be dismissed by the political elite. With this bold debut, Rahbani revealed his enduring theme: that Lebanese society was fractured not only by war but by entrenched power.",
      "A leftist Greek Orthodox, Rahbani also wrote plays and satirical radio shows centered on his violent environment that mock the sectarian divisions of his country.",

      "Rahbani\u2019s subsequent plays solidified his reputation as the voice of the disenchanted. In Bennesbeh Labokra Chou? (What About Tomorrow?), he plays a jaded bar pianist in post-civil war Beirut who drifts through a surreal landscape of broken dreams, corruption and absurdity. The work features some of Rahbani\u2019s most poignant music and biting commentary, including the famous line, \u201cThey say tomorrow will be better, but what about today?\u201d",
      "Prime Minister Nawaf Salam also mourned Rahbani's loss, describing him as \u201can exceptional and creative artist\u2014a free voice who remained true to the values of justice and dignity.\u201d",
      "More than just a playwright, Rahbani was a composer of staggering range. He infused traditional Arabic melodies with jazz, funk and classical influences, creating a hybrid sound that became instantly recognizable. His live performances were legendary, whether playing piano in smoky clubs in Hamra, one of Beirut's major commercial districts that harbors a multifaceted identity, or orchestrating large-scale productions.",
      "His collaborations with Fayrouz, especially during the late 1970s and 1980s, ushered in a darker, more politically charged phase in her career. Songs like Ouverture 83, Bala Wala Chi (Without Anything), and Kifak Inta (How Are You) reflected Ziad\u2019s brooding compositions and lyrical introspection.",
      "Rahbani came under fire from Arab traditionalists for his pioneering efforts to bridge the gap between Arab and Western culture with music.",
      "In recent years, Ziad appeared less in the public eye, yet his influence never waned. Younger generations rediscovered his plays online and sampled his music in protest movements. He continued to compose and write, speaking often of his frustration with Lebanon\u2019s political stagnation and decaying public life.",
      "Rahbani is survived by his mother, Fayrouz, now 90, his sister Reema and brother Hali.",
      "Lebanese pop star Elissa joined the outpouring of tributes to Ziad Rahbani, writing on X, \u201cZiad_Rahbani was not an ordinary artist ... With his loss today, Lebanon has lost a part of itself and a big piece of its collective memory.\"",

She alleged that at one point, government fighters who were brought to the hospital for treatment opened fire, killing a police officer guarding the hospital and wounding another. The AP could not independently verify her claim.",
      "She said the bodies had piled up for days with no one to remove them, becoming a medical hazard.",
      "Disturbing videos and reports from Sweida surfaced showing Druze civilians being humiliated and executed during the conflict, sometimes accompanied by sectarian slurs. After a ceasefire took hold, some Druze groups launched revenge attacks on Bedouin communities. The U.N. has said more than 130,000 people were displaced by the violence.",
      "Government officials, including interim President Ahmad al-Sharaa, have promised to hold accountable those who targeted civilians, but many residents of Sweida remain angry and suspicious.",
      "The Druze religious sect is an offshoot of Ismailism, a branch of Shiite Islam. There are roughly a million Druze worldwide and more than half of them live in Syria. The others live in Lebanon and Israel, including in the Golan Heights \u2014 which Israel captured from Syria during the 1967 Mideast War and annexed in 1981.",
      "The Druze largely welcomed the fall of former President Bashar Assad in December in a rebel offensive that ended decades of autocratic rule by the Assad dynasty.",
      "However, the new government under al-Sharaa, a former Islamist commander who once had al-Qaida ties, drew mixed reactions from Druze leaders. Some clerics supported engaging with the new leadership, while others, including spiritual leader Sheikh Hikmat al-Hijri and his Sweida Military Council, opposed him.",
      "Al-Sharaa has denied targeting the Druze and blamed the unrest on armed groups defying state authority, particularly those loyal to al-Hijri. He also accused Israel of deepening divisions by striking Syrian forces in Sweida, attacks that were carried out under the pretext of defending the Druze.",

      "TOKYO -- Japanese director Kiyoshi Kurosawa, known as a master of horror films set within the neurotic realism of the modern day, will bring his signature edge-of-your-seat storytelling to a genre he has never tackled before: the samurai movie.",
      "\u201cI do want to do it once, and it looks like it might be really happening, although things are still uncertain. I may finally be able to make my samurai film,\u201d he told The Associated Press, noting he couldn't give much detail just yet.",
      "His upcoming samurai film will not have sword-fight scenes or action-packed outdoor shots that characterize the genre, known as \u201cjidaigeki.\u201d Instead, it will be the same creepy quiet narrative of Kurosawa movies, where the action takes place almost claustrophobically, in this case, in a castle that just happens to be set in the samurai era.",

      "He also made it clear he isn\u2019t interested in directing science fiction, but rather pursues realism. However, he readily acknowledged that his films are all made up, in fact, \u201ca lie.\u201d",
      "\u201cMaybe this is my weakness, or my characteristic; I want to tell my stories in a setting of a very real modern-day society, yet I want to entertain,\" he said. \"And so it\u2019s a contradiction that I aim for every time,\"",

      "Despite his insistence on realism, Kurosawa, who counts Alfred Hitchcock among his influences, doesn\u2019t rule out the addition of tiny unreal elements for that perfectly subtle and eerie effect. But his movies are never happy-go-lucky, he said.",

      "\u201cIn the end, it all boils down to: I understand there are many opinions, but we must choose what is right. What does being right mean? To figure that out is the creator\u2019s job,\u201d he said.",

      "France's highest court is ruling on whether it can strip Bashar al-Assad, the former Syrian leader now in exile in Russia, of his immunity as a head of state",
      "BRUSSELS -- France's highest court is ruling Friday on whether it can strip the head of state immunity of Bashar Assad, the former leader of Syria now in exile in Russia, because of the brutality of the evidence in accusations against him collected by Syrian activists and European prosecutors.",
      "If the judges at the Cour de Cassation lift Assad's immunity, it could pave the way for his trial in absentia over the use of chemical weapons in Ghouta in 2013 and Douma in 2018, and set a precedent to allow the prosecution of other government leaders linked to atrocities, human rights activists and lawyers say.",
      "Assad has retained no lawyers for these charges and has denied he was behind the chemical attacks.",
      "A ruling against Assad would be \u201ca huge victory for the victims,\u201d said Mazen Darwish, president of the Syrian Center for Media which collected evidence of war crimes. \u201cIt\u2019s not only about Syrians, this will open the door for the victims from any country and this will be the first time that a domestic investigative judge has the right to issue an arrest warrant for a president during his rule.\u201d",
      "He said the ruling could enable his group to legally go after regime members, like launching a money laundering case against former Syrian Central Bank governor and Minister of Economy Adib Mayaleh, whose lawyers have argued he had immunity under international law.",
      "For over 50 years, Syria was ruled by Hafez Assad and then his son Bashar. During the Arab Spring, rebellion broke out against their tyrannical rule in 2011 across the country of 23 million, igniting a brutal 13-year civil war that killed more than half a million people, according to the Syrian Observatory of Human Rights. Millions more fled to Lebanon, Jordan, Turkey and Europe. The Assad dynasty manipulated sectarian tensions to stay in power, a legacy driving renewed violence in Syria against minority groups despite promises that the country\u2019s new leaders will carve out a political future for Syria that includes and represents all its communities.",
      "The ruling stripping Assad's immunity could set a \u201csignificant precedent\u201d that \u201ccould really set the stage for potentially for other cases in national jurisdictions that strike down immunities,\" said Mariana Pena, a human rights lawyer at the Open Society Justice Initiative, which helped bring the case to court.",
      "As the International Criminal Court has issued arrests warrants for leaders accused of atrocities \u2014 like Vladimir Putin in Ukraine, Benjamin Netanyahu in Gaza, and Rodrigo Duterte in the Philippines \u2014 the French judges\u2019 ruling could empower the legal framework to prosecute not just deposed and exiled leaders but those currently in power.",
      "The Syrian government denied in 2013 that it was behind the Ghouta attack, an accusation the opposition rejected as Assad\u2019s forces were the only side in the brutal civil war to possess sarin. The United States subsequently threatened military retaliation, but Washington settled for a deal with Moscow for Assad to give up his chemical weapons\u2019 stockpile.",
      "Assad survived more than a decade longer, aided militarily by Russia and Iranian-backed proxies. Activists and human rights group accuse him of using barrel bombs, torture, and massacres to crush opponents. But then in late 2024, a surprise assault by rebels swept into Aleppo and then Damascus, driving the dictator to flee for his ally Russia on Dec. 8, 2024. While Darwish and others plan to press Interpol and Russia to extradite him, they know it is unlikely. But an arrest warrant issued by France could lay the groundwork for the former dictator\u2019s trial in absentia or potential arrest if he travels outside Russia.",
      "Any trial of Assad, whether in absentia or if he leaves Russia, would mean this evidence could then \u201cbe brought to light,\u201d Pena said, including an enormous trove of classified and secret evidence amassed by the judges during their investigations.",
      "Syrians often took great personal risk to gather evidence of war crimes. Darwish said that in the aftermath of a chlorine gas attack in Douma, for example, teams collected eyewitness testimonies, images of devastation, and soil samples. Others then tracked down and interviewed defectors to build a \u201cchain of command\u201d for the regime\u2019s chemical weapons production and use.",

      "But that protection has been whittled away over the years by courts ruling that the brutality of Augusto Pinochet in Chile, Charles Taylor in Liberia, and Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107 in Yugoslavia, to name just a few, merited a restructuring of the world's legal foundations, said James Goldston, executive director of the Open Society Justice Initiative.",
      "Syria today remains beholden to many awful legacies of the Assad dynasty. Poverty, sectarianism, destruction, and violence still haunt the Syrian Arab Republic.",
      "Damascus' new rulers are investigating nearly 300 people for crimes during several days of fighting on Syria's coast earlier this year. The interim authorities in Damascus have pledged to work with the United Nations on investigating further war crimes of the Assad regime and the civil war. The global chemical weapons watchdog has called on the new government of interim president Ahmad al-Sharaa to protect and dismantle Assad's stockpiles.",
      "Darwish is working on 29 cases against Assad and other regime figures who have fled to Russia, the Gulf, Lebanon and Europe. He said many Syrians hope Assad sits for a fair trial in Syria.",
      "\u201cIt should be done in Damascus, but we need also a lot of guarantees that we will have a fair trial even for this suspect,\" he said.",
      "His organization has already received requests to bring to court war crimes accusations against those involved in recent bloodshed in southern Syria.",
      "\u201cSo anyone, whatever his name, or the regime, or their authority, we will keep fighting this type of crime,\u201d Darwish said.",

      "At the age of 13, Nahideh is in the last grade of primary school, the limit of education allowed for girls in Afghanistan. The country\u2019s Taliban government banned girls from secondary school and university three years ago \u2014 the only country in the world to do so. The ban is part of myriad restrictions on women and girls, dictating everything from what they can wear to where they can go and who they can go with.",

      "The center\u2019s roughly 400 students range in ages from about 3 to 60, and 90% are female. They study the Quran, Islamic jurisprudence, the sayings of the Prophet Muhammad, and Arabic, the language of the Quran.",
      "Most Afghans, Sahibi noted, are religious. \u201cEven before the schools were closed, many used to attend madrassas,\u201d he said. \u201cBut after the closure of schools, the interest has increased significantly, because the doors of the madrassas remain open to them.\u201d",
      "No recent official figures are available on the number of girls enrolled in madrassas, but officials say the popularity of religious schools overall has been growing. Last September, Deputy Minister of Education Karamatullah Akhundzada said at least 1 million students had enrolled in madrassas over the past year alone, bringing the total to over 3 million.",
      "Sheltered from the heat of an early summer\u2019s day in a basement room at the Tasnim Nasrat center, Sahibi\u2019s students knelt at small plastic tables on the carpeted floor, their pencils tracing lines of Arabic script in their Qurans. All 10 young women wore black niqabs, the all-encompassing garment that includes a veil, leaving only the eyes visible.",
      "\u201cIt is very good for girls and women to study at a madrassa, because \u2026 the Quran is the word of Allah, and we are Muslims,\u201d said 25-year-old Faiza, who had enrolled at the center five months earlier. \u201cTherefore, it is our duty to know what is in the book that Allah has revealed to us, to understand its interpretation and translation.\u201d",
      "Given a choice, she would have studied medicine. While she knows that is now impossible, she still harbors hope that if she shows she is a pious student dedicated to her religion, she will be eventually allowed to. The medical profession is one of the very few still open to women in Afghanistan.",
      "\u201cWhen my family sees that I am learning Quranic sciences and that I am practicing all the teachings of the Quran in my life, and they are assured of this, they will definitely allow me to continue my studies,\u201d she said.",

      "His remarks were reportedly not well tolerated by the Taliban leadership; Stanikzai is now officially on leave and is believed to have left the country. But they were a clear indication that many in Afghanistan recognize the long-term impact of denying education to girls.",

      "MONTEVIDEO, Uruguay -- Palm trees in Uruguay are more than just plants, they are icons, much like olive groves for Greeks or cherry blossoms for the Japanese.",
      "The treasured trees lining one of the world\u2019s longest sidewalks through Montevideo, Uruguay\u2019s capital, and adorn the swanky Atlantic beach resorts of Punta del Este have recently come under ruthless attack.",
      "Across the small South American country, palm trees are falling prey to a fierce enemy measuring just 5 centimetres (2 inches) in length: The red palm weevil.",
      "First the elegant fronds droop. Then the tell-tale holes appear in the trunk. Soon enough, the tree is tilting toward collapse.",
      "The weevil has devoured thousands of Uruguay\u2019s palm trees since its unexplained arrival from Southeast Asia in 2022. But authorities are only now waking up to the threat as the landscape of municipalities transforms and fears grow that the country's beloved palms could be wiped out.",
      "\u201cWe are late in addressing this,\u201d Estela Delgado, the national director of biodiversity at Uruguay's Ministry of Environment, acknowledged last month. \u201cBut we are doing so with great commitment and seriousness.\u201d",
      "The insect and its devastating impact can be found in 60 countries around the world but nowhere else in South America. Authorities first detected it in the town of Canelones, bordering Montevideo, where the insect killed more than 2,000 palm trees in less than a month.",
      "Weevils quietly wreak destruction by boring through the open scars of pruned palms and laying hundreds of eggs inside. When larvae hatch, they tunnel through trunks and eat up the trees\u2019 internal tissue. Death strikes within weeks.",
      "The Uruguayan government set up a task force to combat the plague in March. In May, Environment Minister Edgardo Ortu\u00f1o declared the fight against the red palm weevil \u201ca national priority.\"",
      "As of this year, the red bug has proliferated in eight of the country's 19 regions, including Montevideo. Half of the capital's 19,000 palm trees have been infected, estimates Gerardo Grinvald, director of pest control company Equitec, which helps authorities combat the bug.",

      "The Montevideo municipality this year earmarked $70,000 for chemical pesticide sprays and insecticide injections meant to kill bugs inside infested trunks, with the goal of saving some 850 trees in the city\u2019s prominent Parque Rod\u00f3, a scenic urban park along the coast.",
      "In the southeast corner of Uruguay, home to Punta del Este, a beachy, palm-fringed haven for jet-set elites from all over the world, authorities recently allocated $625,000 for efforts to dispose of infected trees and lure weevils away from affected areas with pheromone traps and other methods.",

      "The Philippine Supreme Court has ruled an impeachment case against Vice President Sara Duterte violated the country\u2019s constitution due to a technicality",
      "MANILA, Philippines -- The Philippine Supreme Court ruled Friday that an impeachment case filed against Vice President Sara Duterte violated the country\u2019s constitution due to a key technicality, a decision that blocks her upcoming trial over a raft of criminal allegations including her threat to have the president assassinated.",
      "The House of Representatives, which impeached Duterte in February and sent the case to the Senate for trial, violated a rule that only one impeachment case could be processed by the lower chamber against an impeachable official in a single year, court spokesperson Camille Ting said.",
      "The House received at least four separate impeachment cases against Duterte between December and February but only one was transmitted to the Senate, which would have served as an impeachment tribunal.",
      "The other three impeachment cases were placed in the House's order of business but were archived with no action and \u201ceffectively dismissed,\u201d according to the ruling.",
      "The ruling was \u201cimmediately executory,\u201d the court said.",
      "\u201cIt is not our duty to favor any political result,\u201d the court said in a statement, suggesting it did not pass judgement on the array of allegations. \u201cOurs is to ensure that politics are framed within the rule of just law.\u201d",
      "Duterte's lawyers welcomed the decision, which they said upheld the rule of law.",
      "\u201cWe remain prepared to address the allegations at the proper time and before the appropriate forum,\" the attorneys in a statement.",
      "Duterte, 47, became the first vice president of the Philippines to be impeached by the House in February over an array of alleged high crimes.",
      "The accusations were led by her threat during a November online news conference to have President Ferdinand Marcos Jr., his wife and cousin, then-House Speaker Martin Romualdez, killed by an assassin if she were killed herself during her high-profile disputes with them.",
      "The daughter of Marcos\u2019 controversial predecessor, Rodrigo Duterte, she also has been accused of large-scale corruption, sedition, terrorism and failing to openly support Philippine government efforts to oppose and denounce China\u2019s aggressive actions against Filipino forces in the disputed South China Sea.",
      "Duterte allegedly backed her father\u2019s brutal crackdowns against illegal drugs that led to extrajudicial killings in their southern home city.",

      "Her impeachment trial was set to begin either next week or early next month by the 24-member Senate, which has convened to hear the case. If the Supreme Court ruling becomes final, the vice president's opponents could file another impeachment case after a year.",
      "Duterte ran as Marcos\u2019s running mate in 2022 on a campaign battle cry of unity in their deeply divided and poverty-stricken Southeast Asian country. Both were scions of strongmen accused of human rights violations, but their strong regional bases of political support combined to give them landslide victories.",
      "Their whirlwind political alliance, however, rapidly frayed when they took office.",
      "Duterte\u2019s father openly accused Marcos of being a weak leader and a drug addict even during the campaign, allegations the president denied. The vice president later resigned from her then-concurrent Cabinet post as educations secretary as the rifts between the two political families deepened.",
      "She later accused Marcos, his wife and Romualdez of corruption, weak leadership and attempting to muzzle her because of speculation she may seek the presidency in 2028 when Marcos\u2019s six-year term ends.",
      "Duterte made the comment about killing Marcos and his family members during a Nov. 23 news conference, a threat she warned wasn\u2019t a joke.",
      "Faced with the prospects of criminal lawsuits, Duterte later said she wasn\u2019t threatening him but was expressing concern for her own safety. Still, her statements set off a criminal investigation and national security concerns and prompted calls for her impeachment.",
      "Among the impeachment complaint signatories was the president\u2019s son, Rep. Sandro Marcos, and Romualdez. The petition urged the Senate to shift into an impeachment court to try the vice president, \u201crender a judgement of conviction,\u201d remove her from office and ban her from holding public office.",
      "\u201cDuterte\u2019s conduct throughout her tenure clearly displays gross faithlessness against public trust and a tyrannical abuse of power that, taken together, showcases her gross unfitness to hold public office and her infidelity to the laws and the 1987 Constitution,\u201d the complaint said.",
      "Last month, senators voted to send the raft of complaints back to the House due to legal questions, sparking street protests demanding Duterte\u2019s immediate trial.",
      "Then-Senate President Chiz Escudero said the move led by Duterte\u2019s allies in the Senate did not mean the impeachment complaint was being dismissed and issued a summons for Duterte to appear when the trial proceeds.",

      "On July 25, 2021, Saied suspended parliament, dismissed his prime minister and invoked a state of emergency to begin ruling by decree. Though some cheered his efforts, critics called the moves a coup and said the events marked the beginning of Tunisia's descent toward authoritarianism.",

      "Women led much of the chanting, demanding the release of imprisoned opposition figures from across the political spectrum, including Moussi and attorney Sonia Dahmani.",
      "The two are among those who have been imprisoned since Saied's power grab as Tunisia's once-vibrant civil society has gradually been suppressed. Activists, journalists, dissidents and opposition figures have faced jail time, including many who have been charged with undermining state security.",

      "Some companies offer more, including Bank of America, which provides tuition assistance of up to $7,500 annually, and Spectrum which, in addition to its prepaid tuition program, reimburses employees earning master's degrees or enrolled in classes that fall outside the scope of its prepaid program up to $10,000 per year.",
      "\"For companies who are looking to attract Generation Z and Millennials, it\u2019s a great way to bring them in because they\u2019re keenly interested in how companies are investing in them and the benefits that are available,\" said Dufrane.",
      "Because many college graduates start jobs after accumulating student loan debt, about 8% of employers also offer help with student loan repayment, according to James Atkinson, vice president of thought leadership at SHRM.",
      "If continuing education feels out of reach financially or seems incompatible with job demands, experts say there are ways to explore the possibility, either by by making the case to your employer or seeking a position at a place that provides education benefits.",
      "In traditional tuition reimbursement programs, employees lay out thousands of dollars to pay for tuition, books and fees at the start of a semester, and usually must complete the course with a passing grade before a company would kick in its contribution.",
      "That means employees would often wait four to six months before being reimbursed, which only works for more affluent workers, said Paul Marchand, chief human resources officer at Spectrum.",
      "\u201cThe person that can afford to put it on their credit card and sit with $3- or $4- or $5,000 of expenses due back to them and not be concerned about that cost, that is not our average worker,\u201d Marchand said. \u201cOur average worker is making $25, $28, $30 bucks an hour, maybe having a second job, maybe a single parent with kids, ... and they\u2019re important workers for us, and we want to help develop them and grow their careers.\u201d",
      "Spectrum launched a program that lets employees sign up for an array of certificates or college courses while paying nothing themselves. The eligible courses and where to take them came from Guild, a Denver company that works with employers on workforce development and tuition assistance.",
      "Walmart offers a similar benefit to its front-line associates, who can enroll in college or certain classes without ever seeing an invoice, according to company spokesperson Jimmy Carter. The benefit also extends to family members of the employees, he said.",
      "As recent college graduates have struggled with debts from college, some employers have added student loan repayment programs as well as tuition assistance.",

      "NASHVILLE, Tenn. -- They were in love once.",
      "Four years before Fleetwood Mac\u2019s \u201cRumours\u201d became one of the best breakup records of the 1970s \u2014 and, many might say, all time \u2014 Stevie Nicks and Lindsey Buckingham were relative unknowns, a young couple putting out their own album, posing nude on the cover like a Laurel Canyon version of Adam and Eve.",

Now, in addition to new vinyl, it will be available on streaming and CD for the first time when it's reissued Sept. 19 on Rhino, Warner Music Group announced Wednesday.",
      "\u201cIt's one of those records that everybody has heard of but not that many people have actually heard,\u201d said Brian Mansfield, a music historian, journalist and record collector in Nashville, Tennessee. \u201cEspecially before everything got put onto YouTube, very few people had heard it because it had never been on CD. But it had this iconic cover that everybody recognized.\u201d",
      "\u201cBuckingham Nicks\u201d featured the duo's iconic harmonies and Buckingham's distinct guitar sound, which later fueled Fleetwood Mac's ability to sell tens of millions of records. But \u201cBuckingham Nicks\u201d bombed upon release and Polydor dropped them from the label, prompting Nicks' return to waitressing and Buckingham to briefly tour with Don Everly.",
      "The rest of the story is enshrined in lore: Drummer Mick Fleetwood heard \u201cFrozen Love\u201d from the album when he visited the studio where it was recorded, Sound City. After guitarist Bob Welch left the band, Fleetwood invited Buckingham to Fleetwood Mac, with Buckingham insisting Nicks join too. The band also included the late Christine McVie on keyboards and John McVie on bass.",
      "Generations of avid Fleetwood Mac fans have tattooed their lyrics or analyzed them at a forensic level, enshrining the tumultuous relationship between Buckingham and Nicks in pop culture. The upcoming reissue of \u201cBuckingham Nicks\u201d is a reminder of the couple's musical beginnings and the special status their only joint album has held among fans and record collectors.",
      "\u201cAs soon as we put it out, it goes that day,\u201d said Michael Bell, owner of Hunky Dory Records, which has locations in Raleigh, Durham and Cary, North Carolina.",

      "PORCIUNCULA, Brazil -- Brazilian Jos\u00e9 Natal da Silva often tends to his modest coffee plantation in the interior of Rio de Janeiro state in the middle of the night, sacrificing sleep to fend off pests that could inflict harm on his precious crops.",
      "But anxiety has troubled his shut-eye even more in recent weeks, following President Donald Trump\u2019s announcement earlier this month of a 50% tariff on Brazilian imported goods, which experts expect to drive down the price of coffee in Brazil.",
      "Da Silva sighed as he recounted his fears, sitting on the dry earth surrounded by his glossy green arabica coffee shrubs, in the small municipality of Porciuncula.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re sad because we struggle so much. We spend years battling to get somewhere. And suddenly, everything starts falling apart, and we\u2019re going to lose everything,\u201d da Silva said. \u201cHow are we going to survive?\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s tariff on Brazil is overtly political. In his public letter detailing the reasons for the hike, the U.S. president called the trial of his ally, former President Jair Bolsonaro, a \u201c witch hunt.\u201d Bolsonaro is accused of masterminding a coup to overturn his 2022 election loss to left-leaning President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva.",
      "The tariff has sparked ripples of fear in Brazil, particularly among sectors with deep ties to the American market such as beef, orange juice \u2014 and coffee. Minor coffee producers say the import tax will hit their margins and adds to the uncertainty already generated by an increasingly dry and unpredictable climate.",
      "Brazil, the world\u2019s largest coffee producer, exports around 85% of its production. The United States is the country\u2019s top coffee buyer and represents around 16% of exports, according to Brazil\u2019s coffee exporters council Cecafe.",
      "The president of Cecafe\u2019s deliberative council, M\u00e1rcio Ferreira, told journalists last week that he thinks the U.S. will continue to import Brazilian coffee, even with the hefty tariff. \u201cIt\u2019s obvious that neither the United States nor any other source can give up on Brazil, even if it\u2019s tariffed,\u201d he said.",
      "But the tariff will likely decrease Brazilian coffee\u2019s competitiveness in the U.S. and naturally reduce demand, said Leandro Gilio, a professor of global agribusiness at Insper business school in Sao Paulo.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no way we can quickly redirect our coffee production to other markets,\u201d Gilio said. \u201cThis principally affects small producers, who have less financial power to make investments or support themselves in a period like this.\u201d",
      "Family farmers produce more than two-thirds of Brazilian coffee. They are a majority in Rio state\u2019s northwestern region, where most of the state\u2019s coffee production lies.",
      "Coffee farming is the primary economic activity in these municipalities. In Porciuncula, which neighbors Brazil\u2019s largest coffee-producing state Minas Gerais, gentle mountains are layered with symmetrical lines of coffee shrubs.",

      "Besides coffee, he grows cassava, squash, bananas, oranges and lemons and has a few chickens that provide fresh eggs. \u201cWe have them because of the fear of not being able to eat. We wouldn\u2019t manage if everything were bought, because the profit is very low,\u201d he said.",
      "Last year, drought \u2014 made more likely by human-caused climate change \u2014 devastated large swathes of da Silva's production. The reduction in supply pushed coffee prices up, but only after many small-scale farmers had already sold all their crops.",
      "Since peaking in February, prices of arabica have fallen, dropping 33% by July, according to the University of Sao Paulo\u2019s Center for Advanced Studies in Applied Economics, which provides renowned commodity price reports.",
      "\u201cWhen you make an investment, counting on a certain price for coffee, and then when you go to sell it the price is 20-30% less than you calculated, it breaks the producers,\u201d said Paulo Vitor Menezes Freitas, 31, who also owns a modest plantation of around 35,000 coffee trees in the nearby municipality of Varre-Sai.",
      "Life out in the fields is tough, according to Menezes Freitas.",
      "During harvest season, he sometimes gets up at 3 a.m. to turn on a coffee drier, going to bed as late as midnight. The rest of the year is less intense, but still, there are few to no breaks because there\u2019s always work to do, he said.",

      "The problem: Mortgages signed by the Paxtons contained inaccurate statements declaring that each of those three houses was their primary residence, enabling the now-estranged couple to improperly lock in low interest rates, according to an Associated Press review of public records. The lower rates will save the Paxtons tens of thousands of dollars in payments over the life of the loan, legal experts say.",
      "The records also revealed that the Paxtons collected an impermissible homestead tax break on two of those homes, and they have routinely flouted lending agreements on some of their other properties.",
      "It is a federal and state crime to knowingly make false statements on mortgage documents. It's also against the law in Texas to collect a homestead tax break on two separate properties. Violating the terms of a mortgage could allow lenders recourse to seek full payment of a loan, according to legal experts.",
      "The mortgage revelations are likely to become fodder in the Republican primary for a U.S. Senate seat in which Paxton is seeking to topple the incumbent, John Cornyn. The situation is further complicated by the Trump administration's criminal pursuit of Democrats over similar issues.",
      "President Donald Trump has accused two of his political foes \u2014 Sen. Adam Schiff of California and New York Attorney General Letitia James \u2014 of committing mortgage fraud, though legal experts say the circumstances are less serious.",
      "The Democrats have long been objects of Trump\u2019s ire for having led various investigations into his conduct as president and as a business executive.",
      "Paxton, himself, has weighed in on the investigation of James, saying he hoped authorities would look into her conduct. \u201cI hope that if she\u2019s done something wrong, I hope that she\u2019s actually held accountable,\u201d he told supporters last month.",
      "The Justice Department has launched a criminal investigation of James, FBI director Kash Patel told Fox News in May. The department received a criminal referral for Schiff last week from the Federal Housing Finance Agency, its director William Pulte confirmed in a social media post.",
      "Neither the Justice Department nor the FHFA responded to an inquiry about whether they may investigate Paxton, too.",
      "James\u2019 attorney, Abbe Lowell, urged the Trump administration to investigate Paxton instead.",
      "\u201cIf this administration was genuinely interested in rooting out fraud, it appears they should stop wasting their time on the baseless and discredited allegations against the New York Attorney General James and turn their attention to Texas,\u201d said Lowell, a prominent Washington attorney whose past clients include Hunter Biden, Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner.",
      "In a statement, Marisol Samayoa, a Schiff spokeswoman, blasted the criminal referral as \u201ca transparent attempt\u201d by Trump \u201cto punish a perceived political foe who is committed to holding him to account.\u201d She added that Schiff disclosed to his lenders that he owned another home that was a principal residence and sought guidance from an attorney.",
      "It is unlikely that Paxton, a staunch Trump ally, will face the same federal scrutiny as James and Schiff. It\u2019s equally doubtful that Paxton will face much legal trouble in Texas: His office is one of the primary agencies tasked with investigating allegations of mortgage fraud.",
      "Ken Paxton and his spokesman did not respond to multiple requests for comment. Angela Paxton, who is a state senator in Texas, did not respond to requests made through her office.",
      "Documents reviewed by the AP show the Paxtons hold mortgages on three homes \u2014 one in suburban Dallas, two in Austin \u2014 that are each listed as their primary residence. The designation comes with a considerable financial upside.",
      "Interest rates on primary homes are significantly lower than those for mortgages on secondary homes or investment properties, saving buyers tens of thousands of dollars \u2014 if not more \u2014 over the life of a loan.",
      "Making a case against Paxton would require \"establishing both that Paxton was aware of the contents of the mortgage document, and also that he was actively aware at the time that he signed it that this was not going to be a primary residence,\u201d said Jennifer E. Laurin, a professor at the University of Texas Law School in Austin.",
      "Legal experts say it is possible that the Paxtons\u2019 lenders prepared the documents and that the couple did not carefully review them before signing.",
      "Even if that were the case, some legal experts say that Paxton, as an attorney and Texas\u2019 top law enforcement officer, ought to have known better.",
      "\u201cIf he filled out lender documents knowing that they were false, then that is a false statement to obtain a mortgage on favorable terms. That would be actionable,\u201d said Arif Lawji, a veteran Texas real estate attorney. \u201cHe\u2019s the chief enforcement officer. You have to be accountable for stuff you do that\u2019s wrong.\u201d",

      "Low interest rates are not the only perk the Paxtons secured, records show. In 2018, they simultaneously collected homestead property tax breaks on their family\u2019s home in suburban Dallas, as well as on a $1.1 million home in Austin, property records and tax statements show.",
      "A homestead tax break is a property tax reduction that a homeowner is only eligible to collect on one property that is also their primary home.",
      "The suburban Dallas home is where the Paxtons\u2019 family has long resided. It\u2019s where Ken and Angela Paxton are registered to vote. It is located in the state Senate district that Angela Paxton represents in the Legislature, which Ken Paxton held before his election in 2014 to be attorney general. It\u2019s also where Ken Paxton\u2019s Senate campaign website until recently said he lived.",
      "Lawji said the Paxtons\u2019 simultaneous collection of two homestead tax breaks appears to be a more clearcut violation. That is because one must obtain a form and submit it to taxing authorities to receive such a tax break, making it an \u201cintentional act,\u201d he said.",
      "The tax break was worth several thousand dollars, a fact that confounded real estate lawyers. \u201cWhy would you try to do all of this,\u201d Lawji said, \u201cwhen you are the attorney general? That\u2019s a bigger question to me than the money, when you are AG and have to enforce this law.\u201d",
      "Separately, land records indicate the Paxtons may have violated the terms of at least two mortgages on other houses they own. The mortgage on a home in College Station, Texas, says the property is for the Paxtons\u2019 exclusive use and cannot be rented out. Doing so would be grounds for terminating the mortgage, the document states. The home has been listed for rent on real estate websites on-and-off since at least 2022.",
      "Ken Paxton also holds a $1.2 million mortgage on a \u201c5 bedroom luxury cabin\u201d in Broken Bow, Oklahoma, that is for rent on Airbnb and other short-term rental sites, records show. The property\u2019s mortgage stipulates that it cannot be rented out.",
      "Representatives for Stifel Bank, Cornerstone Home Lending and Benchmark Mortgage, which issued the mortgages in question, did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "Paxton\u2019s real estate dealings are in many ways distinct from those of James and Schiff, the Democrats targeted by the Trump administration.",
      "The investigation of James centers on forms she signed in 2023 while helping a niece buy a home in Virginia. One form stated that James intended to occupy the home as her \u201cprincipal residence.\u201d But in other documents, the New York attorney general made clear she had no intention of living there. An email to the mortgage loan broker two weeks before she signed the documents stated the property \u201cWILL NOT be my primary residence.\u201d",
      "\u201cAs I\u2019ve said from the beginning, if prosecutors want to know that truth about Attorney General James\u2019 mortgage applications, we are ready and waiting with the facts,\u201d said Lowell, James\u2019 attorney.",
      "For over a decade, Schiff owned homes in Maryland and California, the state he represents, that were both designated as his primary residence. In 2020, then a congressman, Schiff designated his Maryland property as a second home \u2014 a step Paxton has not taken.",
      "Paxton\u2019s real estate dealings are not the first time he has drawn scrutiny for his conduct while in office.",
      "Before his election as attorney general, Paxton, then a state senator, admitted in 2014 to violating Texas securities law and paid a fine.",
      "He spent roughly 10 years under state indictment on securities charges while serving as attorney general. The charges were eventually dropped in 2024. Other alleged misdeeds in office led to his impeachment by Texas\u2019 GOP-controlled House in 2023. He was acquitted in a trial by the Senate.",
      "Angela Paxton did not cast a vote in his impeachment trial and recently filed for divorce, citing Ken Paxton\u2019s infidelity and other \u201crecent discoveries.\u201d She did not elaborate.",
      "What ultimately unleashed the impeachment push was Paxton\u2019s relationship with Austin real estate developer Nate Paul, who pleaded guilty this year to one count of making a false statement to a financial institution.",
      "In 2020, eight top aides in Paxton\u2019s office told the FBI they were concerned the state\u2019s top law enforcement official was misusing his office to help Paul over the developer\u2019s unproven claims about an elaborate conspiracy to steal $200 million of his properties.",
      "The House impeachment managers accused Paxton of attempting to interfere in foreclosure lawsuits and issuing legal opinions to benefit Paul. They also alleged that Paul employed a woman with whom Paxton had an affair in exchange for legal help and that the developer paid for expensive renovations to the attorney general\u2019s home in Austin.",
      "That would be the same house that he declared in mortgage documents was his third primary residence.",

      "Not only did Goldschmidt\u2019s throw not get the second out of the seventh inning but the Gold Glove first baseman's miscue was the ninth error in four games for the Yankees, who committed two Friday night in a 12-5 loss to Philadelphia that dropped them 5 1/2 games back of AL East-leading Toronto.",
      "\u201cI was playing in and he hit a little bit to my right, a little soft and I knew going to be a bang-bang play at first and tried to get him at home,\u201d said Goldschmidt, a four-time Gold Glove winner. \u201cLooking back, I should have just made the play and went to first base there. I think even if I put that throw perfect, Turner\u2019s probably still beating that out.\"",
      "With Turner on third and Kyle Schwarber on second, Castellanos hit a 42-foot grounder at 61.4 mph to Goldschmidt, who was playing in. At the edge of the grass, Goldschmidt moved to his right, made an off-balance throw and the ball sailed over catcher Austin Wells\u2019 glove as Turner scored the tying run, Schwarber took third and Castellanos second.",
      "\u201cProbably too aggressive of a play by me to try and make a play where they were going to be safe anyway and it led to another base runner rather than just getting the out at first,\" Goldschmidt said. \"So that was a mistake.\u201d",

      "Schwarber's tying drive in the fifth off Will Warren was his 1,000th hit and 319th homer, the most for a player reaching 1,000 \u2014 eight more than Mark McGwire.

      "The national team has had to fight for better coaching, decent travel conditions, and modern training facilities.",
      "It paid off with a World Cup title in 2023, the Nations League crown last year, and on Sunday they face England in the European Championship final.",
      "\u201cIt has been a constant with the national team that we have had to fight for acceptable work conditions that would allow us to play at our best,\u201d former Spain defender Marta Torrej\u00f3n told The Associated Press by phone on Friday.",
      "Torrej\u00f3n lived through the lean years, the time when playing for her country felt like, in her words, a \u201cwaste of time.\u201d",
      "And she knows from talking with Barcelona teammates who still play for their country how much things have improved.",
      "Torrej\u00f3n retired from international soccer after the 2019 World Cup as Spain's then most-capped player with 90 appearances. The 35-year-old has since helped Barcelona win three Champions League titles and a slew of other trophies.",
      "She also played a part in one of the revolts Spain\u2019s women have staged to demand more from the men who run the game.",
      "After the 2015 World Cup, Torrej\u00f3n and other players successfully pushed for the removal of coach Ignacio Quereda, who had run the team for nearly three decades, for his poor preparation ahead of the team\u2019s first appearance in the competition.",
      "Quereda was later accused by former players of verbal abuse, an allegation he denied.",
      "\u201cI enjoyed playing for the national team, but the preparation and attention to the player was minimum. It felt, to put it bluntly, like a waste of time,\u201d Torrej\u00f3n said. \u201cThe level of practice and the level of physical training both plummeted compared to what we had (at Barcelona). It was like taking a step back.",
      "\"I am told that isn\u2019t the case now, and I am very glad to hear that.\u201d",
      "Torrej\u00f3n said she saw steps in the right direction under former Spain coach Jorge Vilda, who replaced Quereda, but felt there was still more untapped potential in the team when she retired.",
      "After Torrej\u00f3n quit the team, some players announced in 2022 they would no longer play for Vilda unless he ran a more professional operation. He was backed by the federation. Some players returned to play for him, and the team made history by winning the 2023 World Cup.",
      "The celebrations were overshadowed by the behavior of then-federation president Luis Rubiales, who kissed a player on the lips without her consent during the awards ceremony in Sydney.",
      "Vilda supported Rubiales initially and he was swept away with his boss when the players stood up to force change, from the removal of Rubiales to improving the travel conditions and handling of the team.",

      "Former Barcelona official Xavier Vilajoana oversaw the women\u2019s team and the club\u2019s training academy from 2015-2020. During that time, the club dramatically increased its funding for women\u2019s soccer and built a training program for girls.",
      "Vilajoana said one critical decision was having the same coaches train the boys' and girls' teams. That way the Barcelona style was instilled in all the kids, and that ball-possession, short-passing and pressure became fundamentals of the women's teams as well.",
      "\u201cLet\u2019s not fool ourselves, we spent many years in a very sexist society and that was reflected in women\u2019s soccer. So clearly the change in the mentality of society has helped,\" Vilajoana told the AP. \"But I also believe that Bar\u00e7a\u2019s style of play has helped us see women players in the same way (as men).\u201d",
      "In the background, Spain's strong feminist movement helped get the public behind the players as they made strides for equality and success.",
      "\u201cThere were many of us players who gave it our all for the national team but weren\u2019t able to get this far,\" Torrej\u00f3n said. \"The one thing we knew is that we had talent. We just needed more support.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Archaeologists in central Israel are excavating one of the world's oldest known burial sites, dating back 100,000 years",
      "SHOHAM, Israel -- Archaeologists believe they have found one of the oldest burial sites in the world at a cave in Israel, where the well-preserved remains of early humans dating back some 100,000 years were carefully arranged in pits.",
      "The findings at Tinshemet Cave in central Israel, published in an academic journal earlier this year, build on previous discoveries in northern Israel and add to a growing understanding of the origins of human burial.",
      "Of particular interest to archaeologists are objects found beside the remains that may have been used during ceremonies to honor the dead and could shed light on how our ancient ancestors thought about spirituality and the afterlife.",
      "\u201cThis is an amazing revolutionary innovation for our species,\" said Yossi Zaidner, one of the directors of the Tinshemet excavation and a professor of archaeology at Hebrew University in Jerusalem. \"It\u2019s actually the first time we are starting to use this behavior.\u201d",
      "Archaeologists working at Tinshemet since 2016 have discovered the remains of five early humans that date back to around 110,000 to 100,000 years ago, according to various technologies.",
      "The skeletons were discovered in pits and carefully arranged in a fetal position, which is known as a burial position, said Zaidner. Many were found with objects, such as basalt pebbles, animal remains or fragments of ochre, a reddish pigment made from iron-rich rocks.",
      "These objects, some sourced from hundreds of kilometers (miles) away, had no known practical use for daily life, so experts believe they were part of rituals meant to honor the dead.",
      "Tinshemet Cave is a dark slash in central Israel\u2019s rolling hills filled with squeaking fruit bats. Inside and around the cave is an unassuming stone mound which Zaidner calls \u201cone of the three or four most important sites for study of human evolution and behavior during the Paleolithic time.\u201d",
      "The Paleolithic era, also known as the Stone Age because of the onset of stone tools, lasted from as early as 3.3 million years ago until around 10,000 years ago. Tinshemet Cave is from the Middle Paleolithic era, roughly between 250,000 to 30,000 years ago.",
      "Some of the Tinshemet researchers' core findings were published in March in Nature Human Behavior. A key discovery were the remains of five early humans, including two full skeletons and three isolated skulls with other bones and teeth. Also of note were more than 500 differently sized fragments of red and orange ochre, a pigment created by heating iron-rich stones to a certain temperature \u2014 evidence that early humans had the means to create decorative objects.",
      "\u201cHere we see a really complex set of behaviors, not related to just food and surviving,\u201d Zaidner said.",
      "Using hand chisels and delicate, pen-sized pneumatic drills that resemble dental tools, archaeologists will need many more years to excavate the site. The field work, which started in 2016, is usually done over the summer months. This year, a dozen archaeology undergraduate and graduate students fanned out across the site, painstakingly documenting and removing each fragment of tool, object or bone.",
      "At the entrance to the cave, the skull of one of the early humans is slowly emerging from the rock sediment; it will be years before it is fully excavated.",

      "Tinshemet is exceptionally important to archaeologists because the local climate preserved the bones, tools, and ornaments in good condition, unlike many other parts of the world where these items were lost to time, said Christian Tryon, a professor at the University of Connecticut and a research associate at the Human Origins Program at the Smithsonian Institution, who was not involved in the study.",
      "The skeletons and objects were so well preserved because of ash from frequent fires, likely for rituals. This large amount of ash mixed with rainfall and Israel's acidic limestone, creating optimal conditions for perseveration. One skeleton was in such good condition archaeologists could see how the fingers were interwoven, hands clasped beneath the head.",
      "Tryon said the Tinshemet findings are bolstering earlier discoveries from two similar burial sites dating back to the same period in northern Israel \u2014 Skhul Cave and Qafzeh Cave. Skhul Cave was excavated almost 100 years ago, and Qafzeh Cave mostly around 50 years ago, when archaeological practices were more haphazard.",
      "\u201cThere were so many uncertainties with those sites, but this is confirming it\u2019s a pattern we know, and they\u2019re really nailing down the dates,\u201d Tryon said.",
      "Tinshemet has helped archaeologists conclude that burial practices started to become more widespread during this time, representing a shift in how early humans treated their dead.",
      "Some archaeologists believe intentional burials started earlier. In South Africa, the Homo naledi species \u2013 an ancient cousin of Homo sapiens \u2013 may have been intentionally placing their dead in caves as early as 200,000 years ago. But many archaeologists said the findings are controversial and there is not enough evidence to support the claim of intentional burials.",
      "In ancient times, Israel was a bridge between Neanderthals from Europe and Homo sapiens from Africa. Archaeologists have identified other subgroups of early humans in the area, and believe the groups interacted and may have interbred.",
      "Experts have been studying the two full skeletons brought from Tinshemet for years, but it\u2019s still unclear if they were Neanderthals, Homo sapiens, a hybrid population or another group altogether.",
      "The mix of subgroups created opportunities for different groups of early humans to exchange knowledge or express identity, said Zaidner. It\u2019s around this time that archaeologists first see examples of early jewelry or body painting, which could be ways early humans started outwardly belonging to a certain group, drawing boundaries between \u201cus\u201d and \u201cthem,\u201d he said.",
      "Israel Hershkovitz, a physical anthropologist at Tel Aviv University and the co-director of the Tinshemet site, said the concept of cemeteries in prehistoric life is important because it symbolizes \u201ca kind of a territory.\u201d",
      "He said that same kind of claim over land where ancestors are buried still echoes in the region. \u201cIt\u2019s a kind of claim you make to the neighbors, saying \u2019this is my territory, this part of the land belongs to my father and my forefather' and so on and so on.\u201d",

      "President Donald Trump's sweeping new plan to counter China in achieving \u201cglobal dominance\u201d in AI promises to cut regulations and cement American values into the AI tools increasingly used at work and home.",
      "But one of Trump\u2019s three AI executive orders signed Wednesday \u2014 the one \u201cpreventing woke AI in the federal government\u201d \u2014 marks the first time the U.S. government has explicitly tried to shape the ideological behavior of AI.",
      "Several leading providers of the AI language models targeted by the order \u2014 products like Google's Gemini and Microsoft's Copilot \u2014 have so far been silent on Trump's anti-woke directive, which still faces a study period before it gets into official procurement rules.",
      "While the tech industry has largely welcomed Trump's broader AI plans, the anti-woke order forces the industry to leap into a culture war battle \u2014 or try their best to quietly avoid it.",
      "\u201cIt will have massive influence in the industry right now,\u201d especially as tech companies are already capitulating to other Trump administration directives, said civil rights advocate Alejandra Montoya-Boyer, senior director of The Leadership Conference\u2019s Center for Civil Rights and Technology.",
      "The move also pushes the tech industry to abandon years of work to combat the pervasive forms of racial and gender bias that studies and real-world examples have shown to be baked into AI systems.",
      "\u201cFirst off, there's no such thing as woke AI,\u201d Montoya-Boyer said. \u201cThere\u2019s AI technology that discriminates and then there\u2019s AI technology that actually works for all people.\u201d",
      "Molding the behaviors of AI large language models is challenging because of the way they\u2019re built and the inherent randomness of what they produce. They\u2019ve been trained on most of what\u2019s on the internet, reflecting the biases of all the people who\u2019ve posted commentary, edited a Wikipedia entry or shared images online.",
      "\u201cThis will be extremely difficult for tech companies to comply with,\u201d said former Biden administration official Jim Secreto, who was deputy chief of staff to U.S. Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo, an architect of many of President Joe Biden's AI industry initiatives. \u201cLarge language models reflect the data they\u2019re trained on, including all the contradictions and biases in human language.\u201d",
      "Tech workers also have a say in how they're designed, from the global workforce of annotators who check their responses to the Silicon Valley engineers who craft the instructions for how they interact with people.",
      "Trump's order targets those \u201ctop-down\u201d efforts at tech companies to incorporate what it calls the \u201cdestructive\u201d ideology of diversity, equity and inclusion into AI models, including \u201cconcepts like critical race theory, transgenderism, unconscious bias, intersectionality, and systemic racism.\u201d",
      "The directive has invited comparison to China's heavier-handed efforts to ensure that generative AI tools reflect the core values of the ruling Communist Party. Secreto said the order resembles China\u2019s playbook in \u201cusing the power of the state to stamp out what it sees as disfavored viewpoints.\"",
      "The method is different, with China relying on direct regulation by auditing AI models, approving them before they are deployed and requiring them to filter out banned content such as the bloody Tiananmen Square crackdown on pro-democracy protests in 1989.",
      "Trump's order doesn't call for any such filters, relying on tech companies to instead show that their technology is ideologically neutral by disclosing some of the internal policies that guide the chatbots.",
      "\u201cThe Trump administration is taking a softer but still coercive route by using federal contracts as leverage,\u201d Secreto said. \u201cThat creates strong pressure for companies to self-censor in order to stay in the government\u2019s good graces and keep the money flowing.\u201d",
      "The order's call for \u201ctruth-seeking\u201d AI echoes the language of the president's one-time ally and adviser Elon Musk, who has made it the mission of the Grok chatbot made by his company xAI.",

Their ire centered on Google's February 2024 release of an AI image-generating tool that produced historically inaccurate images before the tech giant took down and fixed the product.",
      "Google later explained that the errors \u2014 including generating portraits of Black, Asian and Native American men when asked to show American Founding Fathers \u2014 were the result of an overcompensation for technology that, left to its own devices, was prone to favoring lighter-skinned people because of pervasive bias in the systems.",

      "The financial world is buzzing about tokenization, a process using blockchain to turn real-world assets like stocks or real estate into digital tokens",
      "As cryptocurrencies become more intertwined with the traditional financial system, industry heavyweights are racing for a long-sought goal of turning real-world assets into digital tokens.",
      "\u201cTokenization is going to open the door to a massive trading revolution,\u201d said Vlad Tenev, the CEO of the trading platform Robinhood at a recent James Bond-themed tokenization launch event in the south of France.",
      "Advocates say tokenization is the next leap forward in crypto and can help break down walls that have advantaged the wealthy and make trading cheaper, more transparent and more accessible for everyday investors.",
      "But critics say tokenization threatens to undermine a century\u2019s worth of securities law and investor protections that have made the U.S. financial system the envy of the world. And Robinhood\u2019s push into tokenizing shares of private companies quickly faced pushback from one of the world\u2019s most popular startups.",
      "The basic idea behind tokenization: Use blockchain technology that powers cryptocurrencies to create digital tokens as stand-ins for things like bonds, real estate or even fractional ownership of a piece of art and that can be traded like crypto by virtually anyone, anywhere at any time.",
      "The massive growth of stablecoins, which are a type of cryptocurrency typically bought and sold for $1, has helped fuel the appetite to tokenize other financial assets, crypto venture capitalist Katie Haun said on a recent podcast.",
      "She said tokenization will upend investing in ways similar to how streamers radically changed how people watch television.",
      "\u201cYou used to have to sit there on a Thursday night and watch Seinfeld,\u201d Haun said. \u201cYou tune in at a specific time, you don\u2019t get to choose your program, you couldn\u2019t be watching a program like Squid Games from Korea. Netflix was market-expanding. In the same way, I think the tokenization of real-world assets will be market expanding.\u201d",
      "Robinhood began offering tokenized stock trading of major U.S. public companies for its European customers earlier this month and gave away tokens to some customers meant to represent shares in OpenAI and SpaceX, two highly valued private companies.",
      "Several other firms are diving in. Crypto exchange Kraken also allows customers outside the U.S. to trade tokenized stocks while Coinbase has petitioned regulators to open the market to its U.S. customers. Wall Street giants BlackRock and Franklin Templeton currently offer tokenized money market funds. McKinsey projects that tokenized assets could reach $2 trillion by 2030.",
      "The push for tokenization comes at a heady time in crypto, an industry that\u2019s seen enormous growth from the creation and early development of bitcoin more than 15 years ago by libertarian-leaning computer enthusiasts to a growing acceptance in mainstream finance.",
      "The world\u2019s most popular cryptocurrency is now regularly setting all-time highs \u2014 more than $123,000 on Monday \u2014 while other forms of crypto like stablecoins are exploding in use and the Trump administration has pledged to usher in what\u2019s been called the \u201cgolden age\u201d for digital assets.",

      "\u201cWhich is kind of ironic given the origins of crypto, which was to bypass intermediaries,\u201d Reiners said.",
      "Interest in tokenization has also gotten a boost thanks to the election of President Donald Trump, who has made enacting more crypto-friendly regulations a top priority of his administration and signed a new law regulating stablecoins on Friday.",

The crypto exchange Binance pulled back offerings of tokenized securities in 2021 after German regulators raised questions about potential violations of that country\u2019s securities law.",
      "Under Trump, the SEC has taken a much less expansive view than the previous administration and dropped or paused litigation against crypto companies that the agency had previously accused of violating securities law.",
      "Hilary Allen, a professor at the American University Washington College of Law, said crypto companies have been emboldened by Trump's victory to be more aggressive in pushing what they can offer.",
      "\u201cThe most pressing risk is (tokenization) being used as a regulatory arbitrage play as a way of getting around the rules,\u201d she said.",
      "However, the SEC has struck a cautionary tone when it comes to tokens. Shortly after Robinhood\u2019s announcement, SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce, who has been an outspoken crypto supporter, issued a statement saying companies issuing tokenized stock should consider \u201ctheir disclosure obligations\u201d under federal law.",
      "\u201cAs powerful as blockchain technology is, it does not have magical abilities to transform the nature of the underlying asset,\u201d Peirce said.",
      "One of the most closely watched areas of tokenization involves private companies, which aren\u2019t subject to strict financial reporting requirements like publicly traded ones.",
      "Many hot startups are not going public as often as they used to and instead are increasingly relying on wealthy and institutional investors to raise large sums of money and stay private.",
      "That\u2019s unfair to the little guy, say advocates of tokenization.",
      "\u201cThese are massive wealth generators for a very small group of rich, well-connected insiders who get access to these deals early,\u201d said Robinhood executive Johann Kerbrat. \u201cCrypto has the power to solve this inequality.\u201d",

      "Public companies have strict public reporting requirements about their financial health that private companies don\u2019t have to produce. Such reporting requirements have helped protect investors and give a legitimacy to the U.S. financial system, said Allen, who said the push for tokenized sales of shares in private companies is \u201ceerily familiar\u201d to how things played out before the creation of the SEC nearly a century ago.",
      "\u201cWhere we\u2019re headed is where we were in the 1920s,\u201d she said. \u201cDoor-to-door salesmen offering stocks and bonds, half of it had nothing behind it, people losing their life savings betting on stuff they didn\u2019t understand.\u201d",

      "WILLIAMSPORT, Ohio -- Sweat covers Isaac Barnes\u2019s face under his beekeeper\u2019s veil as he hauls boxes of honeycomb from his hives to his truck. It's a workout in what feels like a sauna as the late-morning June temperatures rise.",
      "Though Barnes was hot, his bees were even hotter. Their body temperatures can be up to 27 degrees Fahrenheit (about 15 Celsius) higher than the air around them. As global temperatures rise under climate change, scientists are trying to better understand the effects on managed and wild bees as they pollinate crops, gather nectar, make honey and reproduce.",
      "They noticed flying bees gathering nectar avoided overheating on the hottest days by using fewer but harder wingbeats to keep their body temperature below dangerous levels, according to a study published last year. Scientists also say that bees \u2014 like people \u2014 may also cope by retreating to a cooler environment such as the shade or their nest.",
      "\u201cJust like we go into the shade, or we sweat or we might work less hard, bees actually do the exact same thing so they can avoid the heat,\u201d said Jon Harrison, an environmental physiologist at Arizona State University and one of the study\u2019s authors.",
      "But that means the bees aren't able to do what they normally do, said Kevin McCluney, a biology professor at Bowling Green State University.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re not going out and getting more nectar. They\u2019re not mating. They\u2019re not doing the things that bees would otherwise do,\u201d McCluney said.",
      "Generally, most bees are heat-tolerant, but as the climate warms, some experts think their ability to fend off disease and gather food might become harder. And habitat loss, increased use of pesticides, diseases and lack of forage for both managed and wild bees are all listed as potential contributors to the global decline of bees and other pollinators.",
      "\u201cIf you're not well-fed, and your body is intoxicated with pesticides and you have lots of diseases in your body, you're going to be less heat-tolerant than if you were healthy,\u201d said Margarita L\u00f3pez-Uribe, a pollinator health expert at Pennsylvania State University.",
      "Earlier this year, preliminary results from the annual U.S. Beekeeping Survey found that beekeepers lost almost 56% of their managed colonies, the highest loss since the survey started in 2010.",
      "Almost all of the managed honeybee colonies in the U.S. are used to pollinate agricultural crops such as almonds, apples, cherries and blueberries. Fewer pollinators can lead to less pollination and potentially lower yields.",
      "\u201cIt's a very fragile system if you think about it,\u201d L\u00f3pez-Uribe said. \u201cBecause if something goes wrong, you have these super high-value crops that won\u2019t get enough bees for pollination.\u201d",
      "Back at Barnes' hives in Ohio, thousands of honeybees fly around as he gathers boxes to take back to his farm for honey production. Nearby, a couple of his bees land on milkweed flowers, a rare bit of plant diversity in an area dominated by corn and soybean fields.",
      "For Barnes, who operates Honeyrun Farm with his wife, Jayne, one of the challenges heat can pose to his 500 honeybee hives is fending off parasitic mites that threaten the bees. If temperatures get too hot, he can\u2019t apply formic acid, an organic chemical that kills the mites. If it\u2019s applied when it\u2019s too hot, the bees could die.",
      "Last year they lost almost a third of the 400 hives they sent to California to help pollinate commercial almond groves. Barnes thinks those hives may have been in poor health ahead of pollination because they were unable to ward off mites when it was hot months earlier.",

      "Sometimes the heat helps. Here in Ohio, Barnes' hives last summer produced a bumper crop of honey as they feasted on nearby soybean nectar as the plants bloomed in the heat. Still, the lack of diverse plants for bees to forage in an area dominated by corn and soybean fields isn't ideal.",
      "And even the native blooms are appearing erratically, Barnes said. In autumn, his bees search for food on goldenrod, but those blooms are appearing later. And even then, he has supplemented his hive with additional food to keep them healthy into the winter.",
      "\u201cEvery single plant that blooms is something that the bee can use,\u201d Barnes said. \u201cAnd every single plant is affected by climate change.\u201d",
      "It's only in the last decade that people have become aware of the magnitude of the pollinator decline globally, said Harrison, of Arizona State University. Data is limited on how much climate change and heat stress is contributing to pollinator decline.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a relatively new focus for biology,\" he said. \u201cI think it\u2019s super important, but it\u2019s not being studied a ton.\u201d",
      "The Trump administration's proposed budget would eliminate the research program that funds the USGS Bee Lab, which supports the inventory, monitoring and natural history of the nation\u2019s wild bees. Other grants for bee research are also in jeopardy.",
      "U.S. Sen. Jeff Merkley of Oregon said America\u2019s pollinators are in \u201cgrave danger,\u201d and he'll fight for the federal funding. Pollinators contribute to the health of the planet, the crops we grow and the food we eat, he said.",
      "\u201cRather than taking bold action to protect them, the Trump administration has proposed a reckless budget that would zero out funding for critical research aimed at saving important pollinators,\u201d he said in a statement to The Associated Press.",
      "Harrison said his research on this topic would come to a halt if cuts are made to his federal funding, and it would be more difficult in general for scientists to study the disappearance of bees and other pollinators and improve how they prevent these losses. Not being able to manage these pollinator deaths could cause the price of fruits, vegetables, nuts, coffee and chocolate to jump or become scarce.",
      "\u201cHopefully, even if such research is defunded in the U.S., such research will continue in Europe and China, preventing these extreme scenarios,\u201d said Harrison.",

      "LONDON -- When a schoolboy going for a run found the ribs of a wooden ship poking through the dunes of a remote Scottish beach, it sparked a hunt by archaeologists, scientists and local historians to uncover its story.",
      "Through a mix of high-tech science and community research, they have an answer. Researchers announced Wednesday that the vessel is very likely the Earl of Chatham, an 18th-century warship that saw action in the American War of Independence before a second life hunting whales in the Arctic \u2014 and then a stormy demise.",
      "\u201cI would regard it as a lucky ship, which is a strange thing to say about a ship that\u2019s wrecked,\u201d said Ben Saunders, senior marine archaeologist at Wessex Archaeology, a charity that helped community researchers conduct the investigation.",
      "\u201cI think if it had been found in many other places, it wouldn\u2019t necessarily have had that community drive, that desire to recover and study that material, and also the community spirit to do it,\u201d Saunders said.",
      "The wreck was discovered in February 2024 after a storm swept away sand covering it on Sanday, one of the rugged Orkney Islands that lie off Scotland\u2019s northern tip.",
      "It excited interest on the island of 500 people, whose history is bound up with the sea and its dangers. Around 270 shipwrecks have been recorded around the 20-square-mile (50-square-kilometer) island since the 15th century.",
      "Local farmers used their tractors and trailers to haul the 12 tons of oak timbers off the beach, before local researchers set to work trying to identify it.",
      "\u201cThat was really good fun, and it was such a good feeling about the community \u2013 everybody pulling together to get it back,\u201d said Sylvia Thorne, one of the island\u2019s community researchers. \u201cQuite a few people are really getting interested in it and becoming experts.\u201d",
      "Dendrochronology \u2014 the science of dating wood from tree rings \u2014 showed the timber came from southern England in the middle of the 18th century.

      "\u201cAnd so we can then start to look at the archive evidence that we have for the wrecks in Orkney,\u201d Saunders said. \u201cIt becomes a process of elimination.",
      "\u201cYou remove ones that are Northern European as opposed to British, you remove wrecks that are too small or operating out of the north of England and you really are down to two or three \u2026 and Earl of Chatham is the last one left.\u201d",

      "Its military career saw it play a part in the expansion \u2014 and contraction \u2014 of the British Empire. It helped Britain wrest control of Canada from France during the sieges of Louisbourg and Quebec in the 1750s, and in the 1770s served as a convoy escort during Britain\u2019s failed effort to hold onto its American colonies.",
      "Sold off by the navy in 1784 and renamed, the vessel became a whaling ship, hunting the huge mammals in the Arctic waters off Greenland.",
      "Whale oil was an essential fuel of the Industrial Revolution, used to lubricate machinery, soften fabric and light city streets. Saunders said that in 1787 there were 120 London-based whaling ships in the Greenland Sea, the Earl of Chatham among them.",

      "\u201cI trusted the technology too much,\u201d said George McGee, who ran off the road and killed a woman out stargazing with her boyfriend. \u201cI believed that if the car saw something in front of it, it would provide a warning and apply the brakes.\u201d",
      "In unusual coincidence, regulators arguing an Oakland, California, case tried to pin exaggerated talk about the same Tesla technology at the center of a request to suspend the carmaker from being able to sell vehicles in the state.",
      "Musk's tendency to talk big \u2014 whether it's his cars, his rockets or his government costing-cutting efforts \u2014 have landed him in trouble with investors, regulators and courts before, but rarely at such a delicate moment.",
      "After his social media spat with President Donald Trump, Musk can no longer count on a light regulatory touch from Washington. Meanwhile, sales of his electric cars have plunged and so a hit to his safety reputation could threaten his next big project: rolling out driverless robotaxis \u2014 hundreds of thousands of them \u2014 in several U.S. cities by the end of next year.",
      "The Miami case holds other dangers, too. Lawyers for the family of the dead woman, Naibel Benavides Leon, recently convinced the judge overseeing the jury trial to allow them to argue for punitive damages. A car crash lawyer not involved in the case, but closely following it, said that could cost Tesla tens of millions of dollars, or possibly more.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve seen punitive damages go to the hundreds of millions, so that is the floor,\u201d said Miguel Custodio of Los Angeles-based Custodio & Dubey. \u201cIt is also a signal to other plaintiffs that they can also ask for punitive damages, and then the payments could start compounding.\u201d",
      "That Tesla has allowed the Miami case to proceed to trial is surprising. It has settled at least four deadly accidents involving Autopilot, including payments just last week to a Florida family of a Tesla driver. That said, Tesla was victorious in two other jury cases, both in California, that also sought to lay blame on its technology for crashes.",
      "Lawyers for the plaintiffs in the Miami case argue that Tesla\u2019s driver-assistance feature, called Autopilot, should have warned the driver and braked when his Model S sedan blew through flashing lights, a stop sign and a T-intersection at 62 miles-an-hour in an April 2019 crash. Tesla said that drivers are warned not to rely on Autopilot, or its more advanced Full Self-Driving system. It says the fault entirely lies with the \"distracted driver\" just like so many other \u201caccidents since cellphones were invented.\u201d",
      "Driver McGee settled a separate suit brought by the family of Benavides and her severely injured boyfriend, Dillon Angulo.",
      "McGee was clearly shaken when shown a dashcam video Monday of his car jumping a Key West, Florida, road and hitting a parked Chevrolet Tahoe which then slammed into Benavides and sent her 75 feet through the air to her death. Asked if he had seen those images before, McGee pinched his lips, shook his head, then squeaked out a response, \u201cNo.\u201d",

      "Tesla's attorney sought to show that McGee was fully to blame, asking if he had ever contacted Tesla for additional instructions about how Autopilot or any other safety features worked. McGee said he had not, though he was heavy user of the features. He said he had driven the same road home from work 30 or 40 times. Under questioning, he also acknowledged he alone was responsible for watching the road and hitting the brakes.",
      "Summarizing the testimony, Tesla said in a statement after the court adjourned that McGee had \"stated the simple truth that we all know: If he had just paid attention to the road instead of searching for his dropped cell phone and pressing the accelerator \u2014which he was doing for over a minute before the crash \u2014 this tragic accident would never have happened.\u201d",
      "But lawyers for the Benavides family had a chance in the courtroom at parrying that line of argument, asking McGee if he would have taken his eyes off the road and reached for his phone had he been driving any car other than a Tesla on Autopilot.",
      "McGee responded, \u201cI don\u2019t believe so.\u201d",
      "The case is expected to continue for two more weeks.",
      "In the California case, the state's Department of Motor Vehicles is arguing before an administrative judge that Tesla has misled drivers by exaggerating the capabilities of its Autopilot and Full Self-Driving features. A court filing claims even those feature names are misleading because they offer just partial self-driving",
      "Musk has been warned by federal regulators to stop making public comments suggesting Full Self-Driving allows his cars to drive themselves because it could lead to overreliance on the system, resulting in possible crashes and deaths. He also has run into trouble with regulators for Autopilot. In 2023, the company had to recall 2.3 million vehicles for problems with the technology and is now under investigation for saying it fixed the issue though it\u2019s unclear it has, according to regulatory documents.",
      "The California case is expected to last another four days.",

      "Teenagers are turning to AI for advice, guidance and conversation",
      "As artificial intelligence technology becomes part of daily life, adolescents are turning to chatbots for advice, guidance and conversation. The appeal is clear: Chatbots are patient, never judgmental, supportive and always available.",
      "That worries experts who say the booming AI industry is largely unregulated and that many parents have no idea about how their kids are using AI tools or the extent of personal information they are sharing with chatbots.",
      "New research shows more than 70% of American teenagers have used AI companions and more than half converse with them regularly. The study by Common Sense Media focused on \u201cAI companions,\u201d like Character. AI, Nomi and Replika, which it defines as \u201cdigital friends or characters you can text or talk with whenever you want,\u201d versus AI assistants or tools like ChatGPT, though it notes they can be used the same way.",
      "It\u2019s important that parents understand the technology. Experts suggest some things parents can do to help protect their kids:",
      "\u2014 Start a conversation, without judgment, says Michael Robb, head researcher at Common Sense Media. Approach your teen with curiosity and basic questions: \u201cHave you heard of AI companions?\u201d \u201cDo you use apps that talk to you like a friend?\u201d Listen and understand what appeals to your teen before being dismissive or saying you\u2019re worried about it.",
      "\u2014 Help teens recognize that AI companions are programmed to be agreeable and validating. Explain that\u2019s not how real relationships work and that real friends with their own points of view can help navigate difficult situations in ways that AI companions cannot.",
      "\u201cOne of the things that's really concerning is not only what's happening on screen but how much time it\u2019s taking kids away from relationships in real life,\u201d says Mitch Prinstein, chief of psychology at the American Psychological Association. \u201cWe need to teach kids that this is a form of entertainment. It's not real, and it's really important they distinguish it from reality and should not have it replace relationships in your actual life.\u201d",
      "The APA recently put out a health advisory on AI and adolescent well-being, and tips for parents.",
      "\u2014 Parents should watch for signs of unhealthy attachments.",
      "\u201cIf your teen is preferring AI interactions over real relationships or spending hours talking to AI companions, or showing that they are becoming emotionally distressed when separated from them \u2014 those are patterns that suggest AI companions might be replacing rather than complementing human connection,\u201d Robb says.",
      "\u2014 Parents can set rules about AI use, just like they do for screen time and social media. Have discussions about when and how AI tools can and cannot be used. Many AI companions are designed for adult use and can mimic romantic, intimate and role-playing scenarios.",

      "\u2014 Get informed. The more parents know about AI, the better. \u201cI don't think people quite get what AI can do, how many teens are using it and why it's starting to get a little scary,\u201d says Prinstein, one of many experts calling for regulations to ensure safety guardrails for children. \u201cA lot of us throw our hands up and say, \u2018I don\u2019t know what this is!' This sounds crazy!' Unfortunately, that tells kids if you have a problem with this, don't come to me because I am going to diminish it and belittle it.\u201d",
      "Older teenagers have advice, too, for parents and kids. Banning AI tools is not a solution because the technology is becoming ubiquitous, says Ganesh Nair, 18.",
      "\u201cTrying not to use AI is like trying to not use social media today. It is too ingrained in everything we do,\u201d says Nair, who is trying to step back from using AI companions after seeing them affect real-life friendships in his high school. \u201cThe best way you can try to regulate it is to embrace being challenged.\u201d",
      "\u201cAnything that is difficult, AI can make easy. But that is a problem,\u201d says Nair. \u201cActively seek out challenges, whether academic or personal. If you fall for the idea that easier is better, then you are the most vulnerable to being absorbed into this newly artificial world.\u201d",

      "Trump on Wednesday is planning to reveal an \u201cAI Action Plan\u201d he ordered after returning to the White House in January. He gave his tech advisers six months to come up with new AI policies after revoking President Joe Biden's signature AI guardrails on his first day in office.",

      "Teenagers are increasingly turning to AI for advice, emotional support and decision-making, according to a new study",
      "No question is too small when Kayla Chege, a high school student in Kansas, is using artificial intelligence.",
      "The 15-year-old asks ChatGPT for guidance on back-to-school shopping, makeup colors, low-calorie choices at Smoothie King, plus ideas for her Sweet 16 and her younger sister\u2019s birthday party.",
      "The sophomore honors student makes a point not to have chatbots do her homework and tries to limit her interactions to mundane questions. But in interviews with The Associated Press and a new study, teenagers say they are increasingly interacting with AI as if it were a companion, capable of providing advice and friendship.",
      "\u201cEveryone uses AI for everything now. It\u2019s really taking over,\u201d said Chege, who wonders how AI tools will affect her generation. \u201cI think kids use AI to get out of thinking.\u201d",
      "For the past couple of years, concerns about cheating at school have dominated the conversation around kids and AI. But artificial intelligence is playing a much larger role in many of their lives. AI, teens say, has become a go-to source for personal advice, emotional support, everyday decision-making and problem-solving.",
      "More than 70% of teens have used AI companions and half use them regularly, according to a new study from Common Sense Media, a group that studies and advocates for using screens and digital media sensibly.",
      "The study defines AI companions as platforms designed to serve as \u201cdigital friends,\u201d like Character.AI or Replika, which can be customized with specific traits or personalities and can offer emotional support, companionship and conversations that can feel human-like. But popular sites like ChatGPT and Claude, which mainly answer questions, are being used in the same way, the researchers say.",
      "As the technology rapidly gets more sophisticated, teenagers and experts worry about AI\u2019s potential to redefine human relationships and exacerbate crises of loneliness and youth mental health.",
      "\u201cAI is always available. It never gets bored with you. It\u2019s never judgmental,\u201d says Ganesh Nair, an 18-year-old in Arkansas. \u201cWhen you\u2019re talking to AI, you are always right. You\u2019re always interesting. You are always emotionally justified.\u201d",
      "All that used to be appealing, but as Nair heads to college this fall, he wants to step back from using AI. Nair got spooked after a high school friend who relied on an \u201cAI companion\u201d for heart-to-heart conversations with his girlfriend later had the chatbot write the breakup text ending his two-year relationship.",
      "\u201cThat felt a little bit dystopian, that a computer generated the end to a real relationship,\u201d said Nair. \u201cIt\u2019s almost like we are allowing computers to replace our relationships with people.\u201d",
      "In the Common Sense Media survey, 31% of teens said their conversations with AI companions were \u201cas satisfying or more satisfying\u201d than talking with real friends. Even though half of teens said they distrust AI's advice, 33% had discussed serious or important issues with AI instead of real people.",
      "Those findings are worrisome, says Michael Robb, the study\u2019s lead author and head researcher at Common Sense, and should send a warning to parents, teachers and policymakers. The now-booming and largely unregulated AI industry is becoming as integrated with adolescence as smartphones and social media are.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s eye-opening,\u201d said Robb. \u201cWhen we set out to do this survey, we had no understanding of how many kids are actually using AI companions.\u201d The study polled more than 1,000 teens nationwide in April and May.",
      "Adolescence is a critical time for developing identity, social skills and independence, Robb said, and AI companions should complement \u2014 not replace \u2014 real-world interactions.",
      "\u201cIf teens are developing social skills on AI platforms where they are constantly being validated, not being challenged, not learning to read social cues or understand somebody else\u2019s perspective, they are not going to be adequately prepared in the real world,\u201d he said.",

The potential dangers of children forming relationships with chatbots gained national attention last year when a 14-year-old Florida boy died by suicide after developing an emotional attachment to a Character.AI chatbot.",
      "\u201cParents really have no idea this is happening,\u201d said Eva Telzer, a psychology and neuroscience professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. \u201cAll of us are struck by how quickly this blew up.\u201d Telzer is leading multiple studies on youth and AI, a new research area with limited data.",
      "Telzer\u2019s research has found that children as young as 8 are using generative AI and also found that teens are using AI to explore their sexuality and for companionship. In focus groups, Telzer found that one of the top apps teens frequent is SpicyChat AI, a free role-playing app intended for adults.",
      "Many teens also say they use chatbots to write emails or messages to strike the right tone in sensitive situations.",
      "\u201cOne of the concerns that comes up is that they no longer have trust in themselves to make a decision,\u201d said Telzer. \u201cThey need feedback from AI before feeling like they can check off the box that an idea is OK or not.\u201d",

He uses AI daily and has asked chatbots for advice in social situations, to help him decide what to wear and to write emails to teachers, saying AI articulates his thoughts faster.",

      "When the KissCam at a Coldplay concert last week landed on a couple who suspiciously escaped their embrace and tried (but failed) to duck out of the spotlight, the internet immediately got to work",
      "NEW YORK -- When the \u201cKissCam\u201d at a Coldplay concert landed on a couple who tried (but failed) to duck out of the spotlight, the internet immediately got to work.",
      "In hours, the clip was just about everywhere. Endless memes, parody videos and photos of the pair's shocked faces filled social media feeds. Online sleuths rushed to identify who was on camera. Artificial intelligence and software company Astronomer eventually confirmed that its CEO and chief people officer were in fact the couple in the video \u2014 and announced the CEO's resignation over the weekend.",
      "The incident's fallout has, of course, generated conversations about business ethics, corporate accountability and the repercussions that conflicts of interest among leadership can cause. But there are also broader implications at play in our increasingly online world \u2014 about the state of potentially being visible everywhere you go or tracked through \u201csocial media surveillance.\" Experts say it's more and more common for moments that may have been intended to be private, or at least reserved to a single physical venue, to make their way online and even go global today.",
      "So in the era of lightning-fast social sharing and when cameras are practically inescapable, does being in public hold any expectation of privacy anymore? Is every experience simply fodder for the world to see?",
      "It's no secret that cameras are filming much of our lives these days.",
      "From CCTV security systems to Ring doorbells, businesses, schools and neighborhoods use ample video surveillance around the clock. Sporting and concert venues have also filmed fans for years, often projecting playful bits of audience participation to the rest of the crowd. In short, the on-scene viewer becomes part of the product \u2014 and the center of attention.",
      "And of course, consumers can record just about anything if they have a smartphone in their pocket \u2014 and, if it's enticing to other social media users, that footage can quickly spread through cyberspace.",
      "Ellis Cashmore, author of the book \u201cCelebrity Culture,\u201d proposes that the rapid fame of last week\u2019s KissCam moment probably answers a question many have been asking for years: \u201cIs the private life still what it was? And the answer is, of course, there\u2019s no such thing as the private life anymore,\u201d he notes. \u201cCertainly not in the traditional sense of the term.\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not sure that we can assume privacy at a concert with hundreds of other people,\u201d adds Mary Angela Bock, an associate professor in the University of Texas at Austin\u2019s School of Journalism and Media. \u201cWe can\u2019t assume privacy on the street anymore.\u201d",
      "Some version of the KissCam has long been a staple at big events \u2014 from timeouts during sports games to romantic songs played by artists at their concerts. It\u2019s easy to miss, but most venues have signs to inform the audience that they could be filmed during the event. What\u2019s been different in more recent years, experts note, is how quickly those moments can travel beyond the physical space where they actually unfold.",
      "That isn\u2019t only limited to what shows up on a jumbotron. Sometimes it only takes one person in the crowd to capture any interaction on their phone and post the video online \u2014 where it can zip around the world.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not just the camera,\" Bock says. \u201cIt\u2019s the distribution system that is wild and new.\u201d",

      "Then there's the second ring of exposure \u2014 what happens after the video or photos spread.",
      "Experts point to growing instances of social media users rushing to publicly identify, or dox, the people captured on camera \u2014 much like how quickly the internet committed to finding those involved in the Coldplay moment, for example. The LinkedIn pages belonging both to Astronomer\u2019s now-former CEO and chief people officer remained disabled on Monday, and The Associated Press could not reach either for comment.",
      "But it isn't limited to company executives. Beyond someone simply spotting a familiar face and spreading the word, technological advances \u2014 including AI \u2014 have made it easier and faster overall to find just about anyone in an online post. This can happen with videos and photos shared on social media each day, even if it doesn't go viral, experts warn.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a little bit unsettling how easily we can be identified with biometrics, how our faces are online, how social media can track us \u2014 and how the internet has gone from being a place of interaction, to a gigantic surveillance system,\" Bock says. \u201cWhen you think about it, we are being surveilled by our social media. They\u2019re tracking us in exchange for entertaining us.\u201d",
      "And of course, such moments can also impact people who were not actually on camera. As easy as it can be to be identified online today, the internet is notorious for cutting a broad swath or not always getting it right. That sometimes produces harassment of individuals not actually involved.",
      "At last week's Coldplay concert, for example, many social media users speculated that a third person seen near the two caught on camera was another Astronomer employee \u2014 leading to swarms of posts targeting her. But the company later confirmed that she was not at the event and said no other employees were in the video circulating online.",
      "For the now-viral moment, \u201cwe can talk about what\u2019s right and wrong, and whether they deserved it,\u201d says Alison Taylor, a clinical associate professor at New York University\u2019s Stern School of Business. Still, it\u2019s a \u201cvery frightening thing to get a lot of abuse and harassment online,\u201d Taylor notes. \u201cThere are real human beings behind this.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s hard to think that that these kind of viral moments will ever go away \u2014 and there are few legal restrictions to stop users from sharing clips of interactions recorded from anything from a concert to the street widely online. But on an individual level, Bock says it can be helpful to \u201cthink before you share\u201d and question whether something\u2019s really accurate.",
      "\u201cSocial media has changed so much,\u201d Bock says. \u201cBut we really have not, as a society, caught up with the technology in terms of our ethics and our etiquette.\u201d",

      "HONOLULU -- Lawmakers on Maui passed legislation Thursday aimed at eliminating a large percentage of the Hawaiian island's vacation rentals to address a housing shortage exacerbated by the wildfire that destroyed most of Lahaina two years ago.",
      "It's the latest action by a top global tourist destination to push back against the infiltration of vacationers into residential neighborhoods and tourism overwhelming their communities. In May, Spain ordered Airbnb to block more than 65,000 holiday listings on its platform for having violated rules. Last month, thousands of protesters in European cities like Barcelona and Venice, Italy, marched against the ills of overtourism.",
      "The Maui County Council's housing committee voted 6-3 to pass the bill, which would close a loophole that has allowed owners of condos in apartment zones to rent their units for days or weeks at a time instead of a minimum of 180 days. The mandate would take effect in the West Maui district that includes Lahaina in 2028. The rest of the county would have until 2030 to comply.",
      "The council still needs to vote on the bill, but the committee's result is a strong indication of the final outcome because all nine council members sit on the housing panel. The mayor is expected to sign the bill, which he proposed.",
      "\"Bill 9 is a critical first step in restoring our commitment to prioritize housing for local residents \u2014 and securing a future where our keiki can live, grow, and thrive in the place they call home,\u201d Maui Mayor Richard Bissen said in a statement, using the Hawaiian word for children.",
      "Vacation rentals currently account for 21% of all housing in the county, which has a population of about 165,000 people.",
      "An analysis by University of Hawaii economists predicted the measure would add 6,127 units to Maui\u2019s long-term housing stock, increasing supply by 13%.",
      "Opponents questioned whether local residents could afford the condos in question, noting that many of the buildings they are in are aging and their units come with high mortgages, insurance payments, maintenance and special assessment costs.",

      "The report also predicted one-quarter of Maui County\u2019s visitor accommodations would vanish and visitor spending would sink 15%. It estimated gross domestic product would contract by 4%.",
      "The mayor said such economic analysis failed to tell a full story, noting families are torn apart when high housing costs drive out relatives and that cultural knowledge disappears when generations leave Maui.",
      "The mayor told the council the bill was one part of a broader housing strategy that would include building new housing, investing in infrastructure and stopping illegally operated vacation rentals. He said there were limits to how much new housing could be built because of constraints on water supplies and sewer infrastructure.",
      "Tourism would continue on Maui but must do so in a way \u201cthat doesn't hollow out our neighborhoods,\u201d the mayor said.",
      "The mayor's staff told council members that visitor spending would decline with the measure but most of the drop would be on lodging. Because 94% of those who own vacation rentals in apartment zones don't live on Maui, they said much of this income already flows off-island. They predicted the county budget could withstand an estimated $61 million decline in annual tax revenue resulting from the measure.",

      "Statehouses across the U.S. are addressing long-standing bathroom disparities for female lawmakers",
      "For female state lawmakers in Kentucky, choosing when to go to the bathroom has long required careful calculation.",
      "There are only two bathroom stalls for women on the third floor of the Kentucky Statehouse, where the House and Senate chambers are located. Female legislators \u2014 41 of the 138 member Legislature \u2014 needing a reprieve during a lengthy floor session have to weigh the risk of missing an important debate or a critical vote.",
      "None of their male colleagues face the same dilemma because, of course, multiple men\u2019s bathrooms are available. The Legislature even installed speakers in the men's bathrooms to broadcast the chamber\u2019s events so they don't miss anything important.",
      "In a pinch, House Speaker David Osborne allows women to use his single stall bathroom in the chamber, but even that attracts long lines.",
      "\u201cYou get the message very quickly: This place was not really built for us,\u201d said Rep. Lisa Willner, a Democrat from Louisville, reflecting on the photos of former lawmakers, predominantly male, that line her office.",
      "The issue of potty parity may seem comic, but its impact runs deeper than uncomfortably full bladders, said Kathryn Anthony, professor emerita at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign\u2019s School of Architecture.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s absolutely critical because the built environment reflects our culture and reflects our population,\u201d said Anthony, who has testified on the issue before Congress. \u201cAnd if you have an environment that is designed for half the population but forgets about the other half, you have a group of disenfranchised people and disadvantaged people.\u201d",
      "There is hope for Kentucky's lady legislators seeking more chamber potties.",
      "A $300 million renovation of the 155-year-old Capitol \u2014 scheduled for completion by 2028 at the soonest \u2014 aims to create more women's restrooms and end Kentucky's bathroom disparity.",
      "The Bluegrass State is among the last to add bathrooms to aging statehouses that were built when female legislators were not a consideration.",
      "In the $392 million renovation of the Georgia Capitol, expanding bathroom access is a priority, said Gerald Pilgrim, chief of staff with the state\u2019s Building Authority. It will introduce female facilities on the building's fourth floor, where the public galleries are located, and will add more bathrooms throughout to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act.",
      "\u201cWe know there are not enough bathrooms,\u201d he said.",
      "There\u2019s no federal law requiring bathroom access for all genders in public buildings. Some 20 states have statutes prescribing how many washrooms buildings must have, but historical buildings \u2014 such as statehouses \u2014 are often exempt.",
      "Over the years, as the makeup of state governments has changed, statehouses have added bathrooms for women.",
      "When Tennessee\u2019s Capitol opened in 1859, the architects designed only one restroom \u2014 for men only \u2014 situated on the ground floor. According to legislative librarian Eddie Weeks, the toilet could only be \"flushed\u201d when enough rainwater had been collected.",
      "\u201cThe room was famously described as \u2018a stench in the nostrils of decency,\u2019\u201d Weeks said in an email.",
      "Today, Tennessee\u2019s Capitol has a female bathroom located between the Senate and House chambers. It's in a cramped hall under a staircase, sparking comparisons to Harry Potter\u2019s cupboard bedroom, and it contains just two stalls. The men also just have one bathroom on the same floor, but it has three urinals and three stalls.",
      "Democratic Rep. Aftyn Behn, who was elected in 2023, said she wasn't aware of the disparity in facilities until contacted by The Associated Press.",

      "The Maryland State House is the country\u2019s oldest state capitol in continuous legislative use, operational since the late 1700s. Archivists say its bathroom facilities were initially intended for white men only because desegregation laws were still in place. Women\u2019s restrooms were added after 1922, but they were insufficient for the rising number of women elected to office.",
      "Delegate Pauline Menes complained about the issue so much that House Speaker Thomas Lowe appointed her chair of the \u201cLadies Rest Room Committee,\u201d and presented her with a fur covered toilet seat in front of her colleagues in 1972. She launched the women\u2019s caucus the following year.",
      "It wasn't until 2019 that House Speaker Adrienne A. Jones, the first woman to secure the top position, ordered the addition of more women\u2019s restrooms along with a gender-neutral bathroom and a nursing room for mothers in the Lowe House Office Building.",
      "As more women were elected nationwide in the 20th century, some found creative workarounds.",
      "In Nebraska\u2019s unicameral Legislature, female senators didn't get a dedicated restroom until 1988, when a facility was added in the chamber's cloakroom. There had previously been a single restroom in the senate lounge, and Sen. Shirley Marsh, who served for some 16 years, would ask a State Patrol trooper to guard the door while she used it, said Brandon Metzler, the Legislature's clerk.",
      "In Colorado, female House representatives and staff were so happy to have a restroom added in the chamber's hallway in 1987 that they hung a plaque to honor then-state Rep. Arie Taylor, the state\u2019s first Black woman legislator, who pushed for the facility.",
      "The plaque, now inside a women\u2019s bathroom in the Capitol, reads: \u201cOnce here beneath the golden dome if nature made a call, we\u2019d have to scramble from our seats and dash across the hall ... Then Arie took the mike once more to push an urge organic, no longer do we fret and squirm or cross our legs in panic.\u201d",
      "The poem concludes: \u201cIn mem\u2019ry of you, Arie (may you never be forgot), from this day forth we\u2019ll call that room the Taylor Chamber Pot.\u201d",
      "New Mexico Democratic state Rep. Liz Thomson recalled missing votes in the House during her first year in office in 2013 because there was no women\u2019s restroom in the chamber\u2019s lounge. An increase in female lawmakers \u2014 New Mexico elected the largest female majority Legislature in U.S. history in 2024 \u2014 helped raise awareness of the issue, she said.",
      "\u201cIt seems kind of like fluff, but it really isn\u2019t,\u201d she said. \u201cTo me, it really talks about respect and inclusion.\u201d",
      "The issue is not exclusive to statehouses. In the U.S. Capitol, the first restroom for congresswomen didn\u2019t open until 1962. While a facility was made available for female U.S. Senators in 1992, it wasn\u2019t until 2011 that the House chamber opened a bathroom to women lawmakers.",

      "\u201cThe amount of contemplation, calculation, planning and manipulation that went into these crimes is unparalleled in my career,\u201d said Beresky, who has been a Maricopa County Superior Court judge since 2017 and has presided over other high-profile cases.",

It places Columbia under the watch of an independent monitor and requires regular disclosures to the government.",

      "Volunteers are still rebuilding parts of the iconic Appalachian Trail in eastern Tennessee nearly a year after Hurricane Helene devastated the region",
      "UNICOI COUNTY, Tenn. -- In a rugged patch of the Appalachian Trail in eastern Tennessee, volunteers size up a massive, gnarled tree lying on its side. Its tangled web of roots and dark brown soil, known as a root ball, is roughly the size of a large kiddie pool.",
      "The collection of volunteers and staff from the Appalachian Trail Conservancy and local organizations, doesn't plan to move the tree. Instead, their job is filling the gaping holes left by it and many other downed trees along iconic East Coast trail.",
      "Almost a year since Hurricane Helene tore through the mountains of the Southeast, restoration is still ongoing. In places like the Appalachian Trail it's powered primarily by volunteers, at a time when federal resources are strained and uncertain. That labor, made up of people spanning several generations and continents, aims to not only return the trail to its former glory but make it more resilient against future inclement weather.",
      "\u201cVolunteers are the lifeblood of the Appalachian Trail,\u201d said Jake Stowe, a program support specialist with the Appalachian Trail Conservancy.",
      "Stretching more than 2,000 miles (3,200 kilometers) miles from Georgia to Maine, the trail attracts more than 3 million people every year, according to the conservancy. Some committed hikers traverse its entire length to cross it off their bucket list. Others visit sporadically just to indulge in its scenic views.",
      "Last September, Helene killed more than 200 people and wrecked entire towns. Many rural businesses have struggled due to the drop in tourism, Stowe said, such as in places seeing fewer trail hikers. Directly after the storm, more than 430 miles (690 kilometers) of the trail were closed, the conservancy said. That's down to 5 miles (8 kilometers) today.",
      "Hikers still have to take detours around two damaged sections of the trail, both in Tennessee, according to the conservancy.",
      "One spot where a bridge collapsed requires a 3.6-mile (5.8-kilometer) walking detour. The other location is near the destroyed Cherry Gap Shelter, where an Associated Press journalist accompanied volunteers this week making the area passable again for visitors who currently have to take a 6-mile (10 kilometer) detour.",
      "Local groups typically take on day-to-day trail maintenance, such as hacking back plant overgrowth, Stowe said. Larger organizations like the Appalachian Trail Conservancy step in to assist with severe damage, although in Helene's case, safety concerns delayed restoration.",
      "\u201cAt the time, we weren't really in the position to put people in the woods,\u201d Stowe said. \u201cIt was such bad damage that it was just- you couldn't safely do that.\u201d",
      "The area near Cherry Gap has already been \u201csawed out,\u201d meaning downed trees that blocked the trail have been cut and moved out of the way. But root balls are still a major problem because of how labor-intensive it is to deal with them.",
      "When a tree tips over, the root ball lifts a big chunk of earth with it. Filling that hole can sometimes take a week, said Matt Perrenod, a crew leader with the conservancy. The trail runs along the spine of the Appalachian Mountains, and that rough terrain means crews must rely on hand tools like shovels, rakes and pruners to do the job, rather than heavy equipment.",

      "The conservancy also has to consider more sustainable improvements to the trail, such as building steps or features like water bars, which are essentially little ditches that divert rainfall off the side of the trail.",
      "It's a slow process, Perrenod said, but a worthwhile venture to improve the experience of hikers.",
      "\u201cYou don't actually want to think about the thing you're walking on very much. You just want to walk on it,\" said Perrenod, who hiked the Appalachian Trail's entirety about a decade ago. \u201cWell, if we don't do the work, you won't be able to do that. You'll spend all your time climbing over this tree and walking around that hole.\"",
      "Partnering with the U.S. Forest Service and the National Park Service has long been a critical component of preserving the Appalachian Trail. Through contracts, Perrenod said the agencies fund equipment, gas and the wages of some Appalachian Trail Conservancy staff members like himself. The Forest Service also helps the group lug their gear up to the trail, he said.",
      "That's why Perrenod says it's imperative the federal government does not slash those agencies' budgets and workforces. Disrupting support for volunteers could be detrimental for the trail's restoration, as volunteers provide \u201ca lot of muscle\u201d to complete the vast majority of its maintenance, he said.",
      "In Helene's aftermath, volunteerism across the region was \u201csuper high\u201d because everyone wanted to help, Stowe said. This year, interest in volunteering has dipped, Stowe said, but he's heard from people all over the country \u2014 and the world \u2014 who cited Helene as a major reason they wanted to come out and help.",
      "Among the volunteers on the July maintenance trip were three visitors from Japan who work on long-distance trails back home. They were enthusiastic to learn about best practices for improving trail longevity and take those ideas back to Japan.",
      "The trio was also motivated by their own experience with natural devastation. After Japan's massive 2011 earthquake and tsunami, volunteer Kumi Aizawa said people from across the globe came to rebuild.",

      "A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration from ending birthright citizenship for the children of parents who are in the U.S. illegally",
      "BOSTON -- A federal judge on Friday blocked the Trump administration from ending birthright citizenship for the children of parents who are in the U.S. illegally, issuing the third court ruling blocking the birthright order nationwide since a key Supreme Court decision in June.",
      "U.S. District Judge Leo Sorokin, joining another district court as well as an appellate panel of judges, found that a nationwide injunction granted to more than a dozen states remains in force under an exception to the Supreme Court ruling. That decision restricted the power of lower-court judges to issue nationwide injunctions.",
      "The states have argued Trump\u2019s birthright citizenship order is blatantly unconstitutional and threatens millions of dollars for health insurance services that are contingent on citizenship status. The issue is expected to move quickly back to the nation\u2019s highest court.",
      "New Jersey Attorney General Matthew Platkin, who helped lead the lawsuit before Sorokin, said in a statement he was \u201cthrilled the district court again barred President Trump\u2019s flagrantly unconstitutional birthright citizenship order from taking effect anywhere.\u201d",
      "\"American-born babies are American, just as they have been at every other time in our Nation\u2019s history,\u201d he added. \"The President cannot change that legal rule with the stroke of a pen.\u201d",
      "Lawyers for the government had argued Sorokin should narrow the reach of his earlier ruling granting a preliminary injunction, saying it should be \u201ctailored to the States\u2019 purported financial injuries.\u201d",
      "Sorokin said a patchwork approach to the birthright order would not protect the states in part because a substantial number of people move between states. He also blasted the Trump administration, saying it had failed to explain how a narrower injunction would work.",
      "\u201cThat is, they have never addressed what renders a proposal feasible or workable, how the defendant agencies might implement it without imposing material administrative or financial burdens on the plaintiffs, or how it squares with other relevant federal statutes,\u201d the judge wrote. \u201cIn fact, they have characterized such questions as irrelevant to the task the Court is now undertaking. The defendants\u2019 position in this regard defies both law and logic.\u201d",
      "Sorokin acknowledged his order would not be the last word on birthright citizenship. Trump and his administration \u201care entitled to pursue their interpretation of the Fourteenth Amendment, and no doubt the Supreme Court will ultimately settle the question,\u201d Sorokin wrote. \u201cBut in the meantime, for purposes of this lawsuit at this juncture, the Executive Order is unconstitutional.\u201d",
      "The administration has not yet appealed any of the recent court rulings. Trump\u2019s efforts to deny citizenship to children born to parents who are in the country illegally or temporarily will remain blocked unless and until the Supreme Court says otherwise.",

The Supreme Court did not decide whether the underlying citizenship order is constitutional.",
      "Plaintiffs in the Boston case earlier argued that the principle of birthright citizenship is \u201censhrined in the Constitution,\u201d and that Trump does not have the authority to issue the order, which they called a \u201cflagrantly unlawful attempt to strip hundreds of thousands of American-born children of their citizenship based on their parentage.\u201d",

      "The U.S. Air Force Global Strike Command has paused the use of a handgun following the death of a Security Forces airman at a base in Wyoming.",
      "The use of the M18 pistol, a variant of another gun that has been the target of lawsuits over unintentional discharge allegations, was paused Monday \u201cuntil further notice\u201d following the \u201ctragic incident\u201d on Sunday at the F.E. Warren Air Force Base in Cheyenne, the command said in a statement. Security Forces combat arms airmen at all command bases \u201cwill conduct 100% inspections of the M18 handguns to identify any immediate safety concerns,\u201d it said.",
      "The name of the active-duty airman, who was assigned to the 90th Security Forces Squadron, 90th Missile Wing at the base, and details of what happened have not been released. The missile wing said it was an isolated incident and there is no threat to the base or community. Security Forces specialists protect Air Force bases.",
      "The gun is made by New Hampshire-based manufacturer Sig Sauer, which is defending itself against multiple lawsuits alleging that its popular related gun, the P320 pistol, can go off without the trigger being pulled. Sig Sauer denies the claims, saying the P320 is safe and the problem is user error. It has prevailed in some cases.",
      "The P320 was adopted by the U.S. military as M17 and M18 pistols, and the M18 is now the official sidearm of all branches of the U.S. military, Sig Sauer says on its website. In 2019, Sig Sauer announced it had delivered its 100,000th M17 and M18s to the U.S. military.",

A judge heard arguments Monday on Sig Sauer\u2019s motions to dismiss the lawsuit or break it up and transfer it to districts where the plaintiffs live.",
      "There also was discussion of a 2-month-old law in New Hampshire, created in response to the lawsuits, that prohibits product liability claims against Sig Sauer and other gun makers based on the \u201cabsence or presence\u201d of the external safety and several other optional features. Claims can still be filed over manufacturing defects. The law hasn't yet been incorporated into the case.",

      "A judge has scheduled sentencings in December for five former Memphis police officers convicted of federal charges in the beating death of Tyre Nichols",
      "MEMPHIS, Tenn. -- A judge on Thursday scheduled sentencings in December for five former Memphis police officers convicted of federal charges in the 2023 beating death of Tyre Nichols, after the sentencings were delayed when the previous judge in the case surprisingly recused himself.",
      "During a hearing, U.S. District Judge Sheryl H. Lipman said the five officers would be sentenced the week of Dec. 15. However, she noted those dates could change or be canceled depending on how she rules on several sealed motions, including one for a new trial for three of the men.",
      "Lipman said she could rule on the pending motions by mid-September.",
      "U.S. District Judge Mark Norris issued a terse order on June 13 saying he was recusing himself, just days before he was supposed to sentence the officers. He offered no further explanation, and the reason for his recusal has not been made public. Lipman was added to the case the same day.",
      "Norris later recused himself from a $550 million lawsuit filed by Nichols' mother against the city of Memphis, the police chief and the officers. Lipman also took over that case.",
      "Norris had overseen the case since federal indictments were issued in September 2023. He accepted guilty pleas from two of the officers and presided over the trial for the others in October.",
      "A flurry of motions were filed under seal after the recusal, including a request by defense attorneys seeking a new trial. It was not clear if any of those filings asked for Norris to step away from the case. It is unusual for a judge to recuse themself from a case between the trial and sentencing.",
      "The city of Memphis and its police chief, and the Daily Memphian news outlet, have filed motions to unseal the documents.",
      "On Jan. 7, 2023, the officers yanked Nichols from his car, then pepper-sprayed and hit the 29-year-old Black man with a Taser. Nichols fled, and when the five officers, who also are Black, caught up with him, they punched, kicked and hit him with a police baton. Nichols called out for his mother during the beating, which took place just steps from his home.",
      "Nichols died Jan. 10, 2023.",
      "Footage of the beating captured by a police pole camera also showed the officers milling about, talking and laughing as Nichols struggled with his injuries \u2014 video that prompted intense scrutiny of police in Memphis.",

      "Bean, Haley and Smith were found guilty in federal court in October of obstruction of justice through witness tampering related to an attempt to cover up the beating.",

Wanamaker, a successful merchant and civic leader, had it moved to his new emporium next to City Hall in 1909 and then hired a crew of 40 pipe makers to enlarge it so the sound filled the vast space. A decade later, famed conductor Leopold Anthony Stokowski performed there with the Philadelphia Orchestra as 15,000 people crowded into the great hall and mezzanines.",

      "Early Hawaiian petroglyphs have resurfaced on a beach in Waianae, Hawaii",
      "WAIANAE, Hawaii -- Hawaiian petroglyphs dating back at least a half-millennium are visible on Oahu for the first time in years, thanks to seasonal ocean swells that peel away sand covering a panel of more than two dozen images of mostly human-looking stick figures.",
      "The petroglyphs are easy to spot during low tide when gentle waves ebb and flow over slippery, neon-green algae growing on a stretch of sandstone. This is the first time the entire panel of petroglyphs are visible since they were first spotted nine years ago by two guests staying at a bayside U.S. Army recreation center in Waianae, about an hour\u2019s drive from Honolulu.",
      "Native Hawaiian cultural practitioner Glen Kila, who traces his lineage to the aboriginal families of this coastal Hawaii community, said he believes the resurfacing of the traditional marvels are his ancestors sending a message.",
      "\u201cIt's telling the community that the ocean is rising,\u201d said Kila, a recognized expert on the local culture and history of Waianae who is consulting with the Army on the protection of the petroglyphs.",
      "Army officials are trying to balance protecting the petroglyphs with their accessibility on a public beach.",
      "John and Sandy Stone consulted tide charts and drove about 30 minutes from their home early Tuesday to get a glimpse after a watching a local TV report about the petroglyphs.",
      "\u201cIt was so interesting to touch them,\u201d said John Stone, who splits his time between Hawaii and California. \u201cIt felt interesting to kind of have a connection with the past like that.\u201d",
      "It is difficult to date petroglyphs, but an archaeological site in the area is from about 600 years ago, said Laura Gilda, an archaeologist with U.S. Army Garrison Hawaii. According to Kila, Hawaiians arrived in Waianae at least 1,000 years ago.",
      "The beach here fluctuates in size and profile each year, with low-pressure weather systems that form in the eastern Pacific between May and November causing waves that cut away loose sand from shorelines and redeposit them further out, according to an Army report on the petroglyphs. That shift is likely what causes their temporary exposure.",
      "Archaeologists identified a total of 26 petroglyphs. Of the 18 anthropomorphic stick figures, eight are depicted with possible male genitalia and the remainder are of undetermined gender, the report said.",
      "The entire panel stretches about 115 feet (35 meters) long, Gilda said.",
      "When the petroglyphs first reemerged in July 2016, it was after late spring and early summer storms, including hurricanes, with a lot of wave action that swept the sand away, Gilda said.",

      "Based on the teachings Kila learned, the lineal petroglyphs appear to be telling a religious, ceremonial story. He interprets the largest figure, which appears to include hands and fingers with one arm raised and the other down, to represent the rising and setting sun.",
      "Kila said that when the military in the 1930s took over the area and evicted Native Hawaiians, including his family who lived there for generations, his great-great grandmother refused to leave so his family exchanged mountain lands with a coffee plantation so she could remain near the bay.",
      "In an interview included in the Army's report, he recalled growing up in Waianae without television. So \"the ocean and mountains were our playground,\u201d he said.

      "\"The exhibit really tells the story of the Hollywood Ten,\" Louise Mirrer, president of the New York Historical Society, told CBS News, of a group of 10 Hollywood writers and directors. \"And the charge was for the Hollywood Ten, that they were making movies that espoused the Communist point of view.\"",
      "The Hollywood Ten refused to answer the committee's questions. They were held in contempt of Congress, each sentenced from anywhere between six months to a year in prison, and blacklisted by studio executives.",

While he didn't name names in public, he did to the committee's investigator. And he went on to very much endorse the anti-Communist crusade.\"",
      "The blacklist later expanded to include classically trained pianist Hazel Scott, the first Black entertainer to have a nationally syndicated TV show. But the show was canceled after she was named in an anti-Communist pamphlet.",
      "Once out of prison, Trumbo used pseudonyms to write the Academy Award-winning films \"The Brave One\" and \"Roman Holiday.\"",
      "\"So it took about four decades...for the Academy Awards to finally recognize Dalton Trumbo,\" Lessy said. \"And...that was seen as the beginning of eroding of the committee's power.\"",
      "The impact of the Red Scare also extended beyond Hollywood.",
      "\"A number of regular Americans got caught up in this anti-Communist fervor, members of labor unions, high school teachers,\" Lessy said. \"College professors also came under scrutiny. There was a well-known publication called Red Channels that would provide very detailed information on a wide range of creatives. And so even just your name appearing in one of these publications was enough to get you blacklisted.\"",
      "By the 1960s, as the Red Scare had faded, so too did the blacklist's power. And in 1975, the House Un-American Activities Committee was abolished.",
      "\"I think it [the Hollywood blacklist] raises important questions about how to protect a robust democracy,\" Lessy said. \"How do we protect our rights and freedoms, particularly freedom of speech...If you hold unpopular views, should you be punished? Should you lose your job? These are all questions we should be wrestling with.\"",

    "summary": "Paramount Global and Skydance Media agreed to merge last year.",
    "story": [
      "The Federal Communications Commission has cleared the way for Paramount Global to complete its merger with Skydance Media, announcing Thursday that it has approved the deal. The decision removes a final hurdle for the media and entertainment companies to close their transaction. Paramount is the parent company of CBS.",
      "\"Americans no longer trust the legacy national news media to report fully, accurately, and fairly,\" FCC Chair Brendan Carr said in a statement. \"It is time for a change. That is why I welcome Skydance's commitment to make significant changes at the once storied CBS broadcast network.\"",
      "He referenced Skydance's commitment to hire a CBS News ombudsman to review complaints of editorial bias for a period of at least two years. Skydance also affirmed that the company will not have DEI initiatives.",
      "\"Skydance has made written commitments to ensuring that the new company's array of news and entertainment programming will embody a diversity of viewpoints across the political and ideological spectrum and that CBS's reporting will be fair, unbiased, and fact-based,\" Carr said in the statement.",
      "Carr also noted the company's commitment to local news coverage and said Skydance \"will work closely with its affiliated broadcast stations to ensure a productive partnership that will strengthen its affiliates' ability to serve their local communities.\"",
      "The FCC's approval, which was necessary for the deal to move forward, caps a long-running corporate saga over the fate of Paramount, which owns Paramount+, the Paramount Pictures movie and television studios, the CBS television network and CBS News and Stations. Paramount also owns Nickelodeon, BET, MTV, Comedy Central and other media brands.",
      "The companies said in a statement Friday that the transaction is expected to close on Aug. 7.",
      "Paramount Global agreed to merge with David Ellison's Skydance Media in July 2024 after briefly halting negotiations the month before. The deal followed a long, turbulent sales process that drew interest from other major corporate players and investors, including Seagram heir Edgar Bronfman Jr., media mogul Barry Diller, Sony Pictures and private equity firm Apollo Global Management, and Allen Media, the company controlled by former comedian Byron Allen.",
      "Paramount had said it expected to close the $8.4 billion merger in the first half of 2025. But the first half of the year came and went, and the merger remained under review by the FCC and its chair Brendan Carr, who had been appointed to the role earlier this year by President Trump.",
      "Late on July 1, Paramount announced it had settled a lawsuit with Mr. Trump over the editing of a \"60 Minutes\" interview with Kamala Harris, a suit that Paramount told the court was without merit. The company agreed to pay $16 million \u2014 most of which would go to Mr. Trump's presidential library \u2014 and agreed to publish transcripts of future \"60 Minutes\" interviews with presidential candidates after those interviews air on the show. Mr. Trump has since said he expects Paramount's new owners to offer him about $20 million in advertising and PSAs. Paramount said in a statement it had no knowledge of any commitments to Mr. Trump outside of its $16 million settlement, and Skydance didn't respond to requests for comment.",
      "FCC Commissioner Anna Gomez, the lone Democrat on the panel, issued a statement on Thursday dissenting from the decision to approve the merger.",
      "\"I cannot support this order approving this transaction in light of the payout and other troubling concessions Paramount made to settle a baseless lawsuit,\" she wrote. \"...In an unprecedented move, this once-independent FCC used its vast power to pressure Paramount to broker a private legal settlement and further erode press freedom.\" Carr has said that Mr. Trump's lawsuit was not a factor in his agency's review of the deal.",
      "\"It is time for companies, journalists, and citizens alike to stand up and speak out, because unchecked and unquestioned power has no rightful place in America,\" Gomez said.",

    "published": "Fri, 25 Jul 2025 13:18:51 -0400",
    "summary": "The actress and cabaret star put her hometown of Manhattan, Kansas, on the map with the award-winning HBO series about a Midwestern woman returning home and working through grief. She returned to Manhattan, to talk about her surreal journey.",
    "story": [
      "Bridget Everett will try to tell you she's not a celebrity in Manhattan, Kansas, but don't believe her. She did grow up here, one of six kids, so there's that. \"I just love that it still feels like small-town America,\" she said. \"I come back quite a bit and I visit the same spots.\"",
      "But it was when her HBO show \"Somebody Somewhere\" was set here in Manhattan, that Everett became a bon fide local legend.",
      "The show follows Sam Miller (played by Everett), who moves back to her hometown in her 40s, trying to figure out herself, and life, after the death of her sister. Everett was a writer, producer, and lead actor in the semi-autobiographical series. \"I was like, 'Is anybody going to watch this? This is not a cool show!'\" she said. \"You know, like, it's about friendship. I'm not a top model, you know? I don't want to speak for anybody else in the cast! But I think that's exactly kind of why it works.\"",
      "Unlike her character on the show, who returns home to Manhattan, Kansas, Everett stayed in Manhattan, New York, for years, working mostly as a waitress and using, believe or not, karaoke as her main creative outlet.",
      "\"My way of connecting with people is through singing,\" she said. \"It kind of always has been, and it's easier for me to unlock and kind of be who I really want to be when I'm singing.",
      "Those karaoke performances led to her own, now-legendary cabaret shows at the famed Joe's Pub in New York. Everett's performances are sort of unlike anything you've seen, and so risqu\u00e9 we can't show you much of it here on \"Sunday Morning.\"",
      "Everett said, \"What's interesting to me is, like, learning about people, and why am I up there with no bra and a low-cut thing with everything flying around? It's part of who I am, and I also kind of do it to understand myself, honestly. I like to talk about my family in this way because my family and I don't talk about it. I don't see a mental health care professional!\"",
      "And that's the amazing part: Everett's cabaret shows somehow end up being, in part anyway, a meditation on life and grief, including saying goodbye to her father, as well as the loss of her mother, sister, and her beloved dog, Poppy, whom she called the love of her life. \"For a while I felt a little bit of shame saying that, because romantic love is kind of what most people aspire to,\" Everett said. \"My life is driven in a different way. She just taught me how to love, and she just cracked my heart open in a way that, like, no other person could.\"",
      "In fact, it was this side of Everett that HBO and the show's creators wanted to highlight \u2013 the way we can feel both strong and broken, hopeless and hopeful, all in the same moment.",
      "Everett, who writes and performs multiple original songs on the show, says she got her love of music from her mother, Freddie. She also got her sense of humor from her mom, as well as her siblings, including Brock, Brian and Brad, who had given Bridget a piece of feedback: that her acting was improving. \"I was being honest,\" Brad said. \"Her acting, especially towards the end, I thought, was authentic. I even teared up on some of that, which is difficult to do when you know your sibling [is] acting. So, you need to separate who you know, and then see her in a character. And have it move you? I think it's a great compliment to her.\"",
      "\"Thank you,\" said Bridget. \"You could have just said that in a text.\"",
      "The HBO show features a number of Everett's actual friends and collaborators from New York, including Murray Hill, Mary Catherine Garrison, and, in a star turn, the just Emmy-nominated Jeff Hiller as her best friend, Joel.",
      "Though HBO chose not to renew \"Somebody Somewhere\" for a fourth season, it did win a prestigious Peabody Award, and also picked up an Emmy nomination this season for writing for a comedy series.",
      "Everett says the whole thing feels a little surreal: the journey from being somebody somewhere, to somebody who is right where she's supposed to be.",
      "\"Nothing will ever match this, and it couldn't, but that's okay,\" she said. \"A lot of people don't get the opportunity to have a TV show, to live a life beyond their wildest dreams. And then to get to do it with the people I love? It's why it's taken so long for me to move on and kind of let go. But now I'm just trying to celebrate that I got to do it at all.\"",

      "\"The nature of the call was for a cardiac arrest,\" the Clearwater Police Department said in a statement. He was taken to Morton Plant Hospital, where he was pronounced dead.",
      "\"There were no signs of foul play or suspicious activity,\" Maj. Nate Burnside told reporters.",
      "Hogan was perhaps the biggest star in WWE's long history. He was the main draw for the first WrestleMania in 1985 and was a fixture for years, facing everyone from Andre The Giant and Randy Savage to The Rock and even company chairman Vince McMahon.",
      "He won at least six WWE championships and was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame in 2005.",
      "\"One of pop culture's most recognizable figures, Hogan helped WWE achieve global recognition in the 1980s. WWE extends its condolences to Hogan's family, friends, and fans,\" WWE said in\u00a0a statement posted on social media.",
      "\"Hulkamania,\" as the energy he created was called, started running wild in the mid-1980s and pushed professional wrestling into the mainstream. He was a flag-waving American hero with the horseshoe mustache, red and yellow gear and massive arms he called his \"24-inch pythons.\"",
      "Hogan was also a celebrity outside the wrestling world, appearing in numerous movies and television shows, including a reality show about his life on VH1, \"Hogan Knows Best.\"",
      "In recent years, Hogan added his celebrity to politics. At the 2024 Republican National Convention, he merged classic WWE maneuvers with then-candidate Donald Trump's rhetoric to passionately endorse him for president.",
      "\"Let Trumpamania run wild brother! Let Trumpamania rule again! Let Trumpamania make America great again!\" Hogan shouted into the raucous crowd.",
      "He ripped off a T-shirt emblazoned with a picture of himself on a motorcycle to reveal a bright red Trump-Vance campaign shirt underneath. Trump stood to applaud the move.",
      "\"We lost a great friend today, the 'Hulkster,'\" President Trump wrote on his social media site Thursday.",

The first event is Aug. 30 at Cleveland State University.",
      "\"The idea was so exciting that I get a chance to be involved with all these young people and help guide them in any way, especially to make them huge stars and create a future for them,\" Hogan said. \"People might be surprised, but wrestling is wrestling, brother.\"",
      "Hogan first became champion in what was then the World Wrestling Federation in 1984, and pro wrestling took off from there. His popularity helped lead to the creation of the annual WrestleMania event in 1985, when he teamed up with Mr. T to beat \"Rowdy\" Roddy Piper and \"Mr. Wonderful\" Paul Orndorff in the main event.",
      "He slammed and beat Andre the Giant at WrestleMania III in 1987, and the WWF gained momentum. His feud with the late \"Macho Man\" Randy Savage \u2014 perhaps his greatest rival \u2014 carried pro wrestling even further.",
      "Hogan was a central figure in what is known as the Monday Night Wars. The WWE and World Championship Wrestling were battling for ratings supremacy in 1996. Hogan tilted things in WCW's favor with the birth of the Hollywood Hogan character and the formation of the New World Order, a villainous stable that put WCW ahead in the ratings.",
      "He returned to the WWE in 2002 and became a champion again. His match with The Rock at WrestleMania X8, a loss during which fans cheered for his \"bad guy\" character, was seen as a passing of the torch.",
      "Hogan was perhaps as well known for his larger-than-life personality as he was his in-ring exploits. He was beloved for his \"promos\" \u2014 hype sessions he used to draw fans into matches. He often would play off his interviewer, \"Mean\" Gene Okerlund, starting his interviews off with, \"Well, lemme tell ya something, Mean Gene!\"",
      "In 2016, a Florida jury awarded Hogan $115 million in a lawsuit against Gawker Media and then added $25 million in punitive damages. Hogan sued after Gawker in 2012 posted a video of him having sex with his former best friend's wife. He contended the post violated his privacy.",

      "Simon has been with \"60 Minutes\" for 25 years, most recently serving as interim executive producer since the departure of the show's previous leader, Bill Owens, in April. She is just the fourth executive producer in the broadcast's 57-year history, and the first woman in the role.",
      "\"Tanya Simon understands what makes '60 Minutes' tick. She is an innovative leader, an exceptional producer, and someone who knows how to inspire people,\" Cibrowski said in a statement. \"Tanya knows that the success of today's '60 Minutes' depends on delivering a weekly mix of the most informative, impactful and entertaining stories and investigative journalism from around the world.

I'm deeply committed to this level of excellence and I look forward to delivering an exciting season of signature '60' stories that cover a wide range of subjects for a broad audience and engage viewers with their world.\"",

She previously served as the executive editor of \"60 Minutes\" for six seasons, helping to oversee the program's editorial process. Prior to that, she was a senior producer whose responsibilities included overseeing digital content for 60MinutesOvertime.com and supervising production of \"60 Minutes Sports,\" a monthly program that ran on Showtime.",

      "She joined the staff in 2000, working with correspondent Ed Bradley on a wide range of stories, including reports on the 9/11 terrorist attacks, the Duke University lacrosse rape case, and a rare interview with Bob Dylan. Simon went on to produce for nearly all of the \"60 Minutes\" correspondents over the next decade, including Steve Kroft, Lesley Stahl, Scott Pelley, Anderson Cooper, and Bob Simon, her father. During that time, she produced news-making interviews with WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange and hero pilot Chesley \"Sully\" Sullenberger, as well as profiles of rapper Eminem and Olympic snowboarding gold medalist Shaun White. She reported extensively on Boston Irish mob boss James \"Whitey\" Bulger, including his capture after 16 years on the run, and on Lance Armstrong's use of performance-enhancing drugs to win bicycle races.",

    "story": [
      "Stevie Nicks and Lindsey Buckingham are back together \u2014 sort of.\u00a0 A week after setting off a firestorm of speculation, Nicks and Buckingham announced that their first studio album, \"Buckingham Nicks,\" will be officially reissued in all formats, including digital, for the first time in the U.S. since the early 1980s.",
      "The former Fleetwood Mac bandmates shared a pair of cryptic messages across their Instagram accounts last week which combined to read, \"And if you go forward\u2026 I'll meet you there\" \u2014 lyrics from \"Frozen Love,\" a song off the duo's fabled 1973 album. Social media lit up with discussion of a possible reunion, seven years after Buckingham was fired from Fleetwood Mac.",
      "On Wednesday, Nicks and Buckingham jointly posted a video of a billboard advertising the album's reissue going up in Los Angeles, announcing in the post's caption that the first single from the release, a newly remastered edition of \"Crying In The Night,\" was available now to stream.",
      "Nicks and Buckingham released \"Buckingham Nicks\" shortly before joining Fleetwood Mac in 1974. It was a commercial failure, resulting in their label, Polydor Records, dropping the pair from their contract. The album's last official release was a 1981 vinyl pressing from Polydor, according to Discogs, but the record has never been available on CD or digital, although bootlegs have surfaced over the years.",
      "Now, premium vinyl record producer Rhino High Fidelity is gearing up to release the full album on Sept. 19, alongside fresh liner notes from music journalist David Fricke, including interviews with both Buckingham and Nicks.",
      "\"[We] knew what we had as a duo, two songwriters that sang really well together. And it was a very natural thing, from the beginning.\" Nicks is quoted as saying in a Rhino press release. Buckingham said the album \"stands up in a way you hope it would, by these two kids who were pretty young to be doing that work.\"",
      "The remastered album is now available to pre-order in a standard edition and a deluxe edition, which includes two 7-inch singles, \"Crying In The Night\" and \"Don't Let Me Down Again.\" The standard edition is limited to 5,000 copies, while the singles are numbered to 2,000.",
      "Rumors of a possible \"Buckingham Nicks\" reissue have percolated for years. Back in 2011, Buckingham told Rolling Stone that the album has \"been a victim of inertia. It's funny, I spent a lot of time with Stevie this year when she was finishing her album and we were getting along great. We have every intention of putting that album back out and possibly even doing something along with it, but I can't put any specifics on that.\"",
      "Rhino sourced the audio for the remastered vinyl from the duo's original analog master tapes of the album, which was recorded at Sound City Studios in Los Angeles, not far from the billboard announcing its long-awaited return.",

      "Ozzy Osbourne, the heavy metal legend who rose to fame in the pioneering group Black Sabbath, has died, his family said in a statement to CBS News. He was 76.",
      "\"It is with more sadness than mere words can convey that we have to report that our beloved Ozzy Osbourne has passed away this morning,\" the family said in the statement. \"He was with his family and surrounded by love. We ask everyone to respect our family privacy at this time.\"",
      "The family's statement didn't provide additional details about the circumstances surrounding Osbourne's death.",
      "Osbourne revealed in 2020 that he was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease, the movement disorder affecting the nervous system that gets worse over time. A year earlier, the rock star postponed all of his 2019 performances after falling at his home in Los Angeles, which aggravated injuries from a 2003 all-terrain vehicle accident. He announced in 2023 that he would retire from touring.",
      "\"Ozzy was someone who lived hard, rocked hard and retired over and over again, starting, I think, first in the '90s,\" Joe Levy, a contributor for Rolling Stone magazine, told CBS News on Tuesday following news of Osbourne's death. \"He retired at least two times, kept coming back, and the fact that his Parkinson's diagnosis kept him from performing made it all the more amazing that just two weeks ago, he took the stage for what absolutely would be the final time.\"",
      "Either clad in black or bare-chested, the singer was often the target of parents' groups for his imagery and once caused an uproar for biting the head off a bat. Later, he would reveal himself to be a doddering and sweet father on the reality TV show \"The Osbournes.\"",
      "The Big Bang of heavy metal",
      "Black Sabbath's 1969 self-titled debut LP has been likened to the Big Bang of heavy metal. It came during the height of the Vietnam War and crashed the hippie party, dripping menace and foreboding. The cover of the record was of a spooky figure against a stark landscape. The music was loud, dense and angry, and marked a shift in rock 'n' roll.",
      "The band's second album, \"Paranoid,\" included such classic metal tunes as \"War Pigs,\" \"Iron Man\" and \"Fairies Wear Boots.\" The song \"Paranoid\" only reached No. 61 on the Billboard Hot 100 but became in many ways the band's signature song. Both albums were voted among the top 10 greatest heavy metal albums of all time by readers of Rolling Stone magazine.",
      "\"Black Sabbath are the Beatles of heavy metal. Anybody who's serious about metal will tell you it all comes down to Sabbath,\" Dave Navarro of the band Jane's Addiction wrote in a 2010 tribute in Rolling Stone. \"There's a direct line you can draw back from today's metal, through Eighties bands like Iron Maiden, back to Sabbath.\"",
      "Sabbath fired Osbourne in 1979 for his legendary excesses, like showing up late for rehearsals and missing gigs. \"We knew we didn't really have a choice but to sack him because he was just so out of control. But we were all very down about the situation,\" wrote bassist Terry \"Geezer\" Butler in his memoir, \"Into the Void.\"",
      "Osbourne reemerged the next year as a solo artist with \"Blizzard of Ozz\" and the following year's \"Diary of a Madman,\" both hard rock classics that went multi-platinum and spawned enduring favorites such as \"Crazy Train,\" \"Goodbye to Romance,\" \"Flying High Again\" and \"You Can't Kill Rock and Roll.\" Osbourne was twice inducted to the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame \u2014 once with Sabbath in 2006 and again in 2024 as a solo artist.",
      "The original Sabbath lineup reunited for the first time in 20 years in July 2025 in the U.K. for what Osborne said would be his final concert. \"Let the madness begin!\" he told 42,000 fans.",
      "Metallica, Guns N Roses, Slayer, Tool, Pantera, Gojira, Alice in Chains, Lamb of God, Halestorm, Anthrax, Rival Sons and Mastodon did sets. Tom Morello, Aerosmith's Steven Tyler, Billy Corgan, Ronnie Wood, Travis Barker, Sammy Hagar, Andrew Watt, Yungblud, Korn's Jonathan Davis, Nuno Bettencourt, Chad Smith and Vernon Reid made appearances. Actor Jason Momoa was the host for the festivities.",
      "\"Black Sabbath: we'd all be different people without them, that's the truth,\" said Pantera singer Phil Anselmo. \"I know I wouldn't be up here with a microphone in my hand without Black Sabbath.\"",
      "Outlandish exploits and a classic look",
      "Osbourne embodied the excesses of metal. His outlandish exploits included relieving himself on the Alamo, snorting a line of ants off a sidewalk and, most memorably, biting the head off a live bat that a fan threw onstage during a 1981 concert. (He said he thought it was rubber.)",
      "In a statement posted to its Facebook page Tuesday, the Alamo said it was \"saddened to hear\" of Osbourne's death.",
      "\"His relationship with the Alamo was marked initially by a deeply disrespectful incident in 1982,\" the statement reads. \"This act profoundly and rightfully upset many who hold this site sacred. However, redemption and reconciliation eventually became part of his history as well. In 1992, Ozzy personally apologized to then-Mayor Nelson Wolff and expressed genuine remorse for his actions. Decades later, in 2015, he revisited the Alamo grounds to learn and appreciate the site's profound history, openly demonstrating humility and understanding.\"",
      "Osbourne was sued in 1987 by parents of a 19-year-old teen who died by suicide while listening to his song \"Suicide Solution.\" The lawsuit was dismissed. Osbourne said the song was really about the dangers of alcohol, which caused the death of his friend Bon Scott, lead singer of AC/DC.",
      "Then-Cardinal John J. O'Connor of New York claimed in 1990 that Osbourne's songs led to demonic possession and even suicide. \"You are ignorant about the true meaning of my songs,\" the singer wrote back. \"You have also insulted the intelligence of rock fans all over the world.\"",
      "Audiences at Osbourne shows could be mooned or spit on by the singer. They would often be hectored to scream along with the song, but the Satan-invoking Osbourne would usually send the crowds home with their ears ringing and a hearty \"God bless!\"",
      "He started an annual tour \u2014 Ozzfest \u2014   in 1996 after he was rejected from the lineup of what was then the top touring music festival, Lollapalooza. Ozzfest has gone on to host such bands as Slipknot, Tool, Megadeth, Rob Zombie, System of a Down, Limp Bizkit and Linkin Park.",
      "Osbourne's look changed little over his life. He wore his long hair flat, heavy black eye makeup and round glasses, often wearing a cross around his neck. In 2013, he reunited with Black Sabbath for the dour, raw \"13,\" which reached No. 1 on the U.K. Albums Chart and peaked at No. 86 on the U.S. Billboard 200. In 2019, he had a Top 10 hit when featured on Post Malone's \"Take What You Want,\" Osbourne's first song in the Top 10 since 1989.",
      "In 2020, he released the album \"Ordinary Man,\" which had as its title song a duet with Elton John. \"I've been a bad guy, been higher than the blue sky/And the truth is I don't wanna die an ordinary man,\" he sang. In 2022, he landed his first career back-to-back No. 1 rock radio singles from his album \"Patient Number 9,\" which featured collaborations with Jeff Beck, Eric Clapton, Mike McCready, Chad Smith, Robert Trujillo and Duff McKagan. It earned four Grammy nominations.",
      "At the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame induction ceremony in 2024, Jack Black called him \"greatest frontman in the history of rock and roll\" and \"the Jack Nicholson of rock.\" Osbourne thanked his fans, his guitarist Randy Rhoads and his longtime wife, Sharon.",
      "The beginnings of Black Sabbath",
      "John Michael Osbourne was raised in the gritty city of Birmingham, England. Kids in school nicknamed him Ozzy, short for his surname. As a boy, he loved the Four Seasons, Chuck Berry and Little Richard. The Beatles made a huge impression.",
      "\"They came from Liverpool, which was approximately 60 miles north of where I come from,\" he told Billboard. \"So all of a sudden it was in my grasp, but I never thought it would be as successful as it became.\"",
      "In the late 1960s, Osbourne had teamed up with Butler, guitarist Tony Iommi and drummer Bill Ward as the Polka Tulk Blues Band. They decided to rename the band Earth, but found to their dismay there was another band with that name. So they changed the name to the American title of the classic Italian horror movie \"I Tre Volti Della Paura,\" starring Boris Karloff: Black Sabbath.",
      "Once they found their sludgy, ominous groove, the band was productive, putting out their self-titled debut and \"Paranoid\" in 1970, \"Master of Reality\" in 1971, \"Vol. 4\" in 1972 and \"Sabbath Bloody Sabbath\" in 1973.",
      "The music was all about industrial guitar riffs and disorienting changes in time signatures, along with lyrics that spoke of alienation and doom. \"People think I'm insane because I am frowning all the time,\" Osbourne sang in one song. \"All day long I think of things but nothing seems to satisfy/Think I'll lose my mind if I don't find something to pacify.\"",
      "The Guardian newspaper in 2009 said the band \"introduced working-class anger, stoner sludge grooves and witchy horror-rock to flower power. Black Sabbath confronted the empty platitudes of the 1960s and, along with Altamont and Charles Manson, almost certainly helped kill off the hippy counterculture.\"",
      "After Sabbath, Osbourne had an uncanny knack for calling some of the most creative young guitarists to his side. When he went solo, he hired the brilliant innovator Rhoads, who played on two of Osbourne's finest solo albums, \"Blizzard of Ozz\" and \"Diary of a Madman.\" Rhoads was killed in a freak plane accident in 1982; Osbourne released the live album \"Tribute\" in 1987 in his memory.",
      "Osbourne then signed Jake E. Lee, who lent his talents to the platinum albums \"Bark at the Moon\" and \"The Ultimate Sin.\" Hotshot Zakk Wylde joined Osbourne's band for \"No Rest for the Wicked\" and the multiplatinum \"No More Tears.\"",
      "\"They come along, they sprout wings, they blossom, and they fly off,\" Osbourne said of his players in 1995 to The Associated Press. \"But I have to move on. To get a new player now and again boosts me on.\"",
      "Music world reacts to Osbourne's death",
      "Several musicians and celebrities, including Osbourne's Black Sabbath bandmates, took to social media to respond Tuesday to the news of his death.",
      "\"I just can't believe it! My dear dear friend Ozzy has passed away only weeks after our show at Villa Park,\" Black Sabbath guitarist and band co-founder Tony Iommi\u00a0wrote on X, referring to the farewell show earlier this month. \"It's just such heartbreaking news that I can't really find the words, there won't ever be another like him. Geezer, Bill and myself have lost our brother. My thoughts go out to Sharon and all the Osbourne family. Rest in peace Oz.\"",
      "Black Sabbath bassist Geezer Butler wrote on X: \"Goodbye dear friend - thanks for all those years - we had some great fun. 4 kids from Aston- who'd have thought, eh? So glad we got to do it one last time, back in Aston. Love you.\"",
      "On Instagram, Elton John described Osbourne as a \"dear friend and a huge trailblazer who secured his place in the pantheon of rock gods \u2014 a true legend. He was also one of the funniest people I've ever met. I will miss him dearly. To Sharon and the family, I send my condolences and love.\"",
      "Rolling Stones guitarist Ronnie Wood, who took part in Osbourne's farewell concert, wrote on X that he was \"so very sad to hear of the death of Ozzy Osbourne. What a lovely goodbye concert he had at Back To The Beginning in Birmingham.\"",
      "Kiss co-founder Gene Simmons called Osbourne a \"giant\" who was \"Admired and loved by millions of fans worldwide. Prayers and condolences go out to the Osborne family.\"",
      "Actor Jason Momoa, who hosted the farewell show, wrote on Instagram, \"Love you @ozzyosbourne All my aloha @sharonosbourne and ohana. So grateful. RIP.\"",
      "Mike McCready, lead guitarist and founding member of Pearl Jam, wrote on X that he discovered Black Sabbath's music in high school.",
      "\"'War Pigs' was terrifying and mesmerizing at the same time,\" McCready wrote. \"It was Ozzy's voice that took me away to a dark universe. A great escape. Then when The 'Blizzard of Ozz' record came out I was instantly a fan. Randy Rhoads was an influence on me to play lead guitar. Luckily I got to play on the song 'Immortal' on the last record. Thanks for the music, Ozzy it makes our journey in life better.\"",
      "Courting controversy \u2014 and wholesomeness",
      "Whomever he was playing with, Osbourne wasn't likely to back down from controversy. He had the last laugh when the TV evangelist the Rev. Jimmy Swaggart in 1986 lambasted various rock groups and rock magazines as \"the new pornography,\" prompting some retailers to pull Osbourne's album.",
      "When Swaggart later was caught with a sex worker in 1988, Osbourne put out the song \"Miracle Man\" about his foe: \"Miracle man got busted/miracle man got busted,\" he sang. \"Today I saw a Miracle Man, on TV cryin'/Such a hypocritical man, born again, dying.\"",
      "Much later, a whole new Osbourne would be revealed when \"The Osbournes,\" which ran on MTV from 2002-2005, showed this one-time self-proclaimed madman drinking Diet Cokes as he struggled to find the History Channel on his new satellite television or warning his kids not to smoke or drink before they embarked on a night on the town.",
      "Later, he and his son Jack toured America on the travel show \"Ozzy & Jack's World Detour,\" where the pair visited such places as Mount Rushmore and the Space Center Houston. Osbourne was honored in 2014 with the naming of a bat frog found in the Amazon that makes high-pitched, batlike calls. It was dubbed Dendropsophus ozzyi.",
      "He also met Queen Elizabeth II during her Golden Jubilee weekend. He was standing next to singer-actor Cliff Richard. \"She took one look at the two of us, said 'Oh, so this is what they call variety, is it?' then cracked up laughing. I honestly thought that Sharon had slipped some acid into my cornflakes that morning,\" he wrote in \"I Am Ozzy.\"",
      "Thelma Riley and Osbourne married in 1971; Osbourne adopted her son Elliot Kingsley, and they had two more children, Jessica and Louis. Osbourne later met Sharon, who became her own celebrity persona, when she was running her father's Los Angeles office. Her father was Don Arden, a top concert promoter and artist manager. She went to Osbourne's hotel in Los Angeles to collect money, which Osbourne had spent on drugs.",
      "\"She says she'll come back in three days and I'd better have it. I'd always fancied her and I thought, 'Ah, she's coming back! Maybe I have a chance.' I had pizza hanging from my hair, cigarette ashes on my shirt,\" he told the Los Angeles Times in 2000. They married in 1982, had three children \u2014 Kelly, Aimee and Jack \u2014 and endured periodic separations and reconciliations.",
      "He is survived by Sharon, and his children.",

      "In a statement Monday, the Costa Rican Red Cross said it was alerted to a water accident on Sunday at 2:10 p.m. local time, and it dispatched three ambulances.",
      "The Red Cross said two adult men were treated on-site and one was transferred to a local clinic in critical condition. They tried to resuscitate Warner, but he didn't show vital signs and was declared dead. Costa Rica's Judicial Investigation Department said the other person involved in the incident had \"entered the sea to try to help Mr. Warner.\"",
      "Warner starred as Theo Huxtable on \"The Cosby Show\" from 1984 to 1992. His performance earned him an Emmy nomination for outstanding supporting actor in a comedy series in 1986.",
      "In 2023, Warner told CBS Pittsburgh that being part of \"The Cosby Show\" was an \"awesome\" experience.",
      "\"That show had such an impact on the culture here in America but also a global impact on how Black people saw ourselves globally and how the rest of the world saw us,\" he said. \"So I'm proud to have been part of that legacy and it's been a great ride ever since.\"",
      "Warner said in a 2015 interview with The Associated Press that he was saddened that the show's legacy was \"tarnished\" by \"Cosby Show\" patriarch Bill Cosby, who was\u00a0accused of sexual assault by multiple women. Cosby's\u00a0conviction in a Pennsylvania case\u00a0was later overturned.",
      "Warner went on to star in other TV shows, including \"Malcolm & Eddie\" (1996-2000), \"Reed Between the Lines\" (2011-2015) and \"The Resident\" (2018-2023). He also voiced The Producer on \"The Magic School Bus\" (1994-1997). He made his feature film debut in \"Drop Zone\" in 1994.",
      "Warner also directed episodes of several TV shows, including \"The Cosby Show,\" \"All That,\" \"Keenan & Kel\" and \"The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air,\" according to his biography on his website.",
      "Most recently, he appeared in a few episodes of \"Alert: Missing Persons Unit\" and was hosting the podcast \"Not All Hood,\" looking at the different experiences of Black Americans.",
      "Warner was also a poet and a musician. He won a Grammy for best traditional R&B performance in 2015 for his part in a cover of Stevie Wonder's \"Jesus Children of America,\" and was nominated for another Grammy for best spoken word poetry.",
      "Fellow poet and author Kevin Powell, who was a friend of Warner's, described him as a devoted husband and father who was humble, kind and supportive of other people.",
      "\"You would have never known he was a major child star,\" Powell said in an interview Monday with CBS News. \"He was never someone who was into the celebrity of it. He knew what he was. He knew, you know, that he was America's son. He literally was America's son as the only male child on that historic show, 'The Cosby Show.'\"",
      "Powell said he was struck by the emotional reactions from fans on social media. \"It's someone you came of age with,\" he said of Warner.",
      "Powell recalled publishing a poem Warner wrote in a special issue of the magazine \"African Voices\" for the 50th anniversary of hip-hop in 2023.",
      "Warner was a lifelong hip-hop fan, Powell said, but he also was \"concerned about a lot of the images that were being put out there.\"",
      "\"So that became kind of his thing in the last few years, like how are we representing ourselves as a community, as a people, with the art that we're creating?\" he said. \"That sticks with me because he was someone who understood he had a huge platform. He had a famous name and people would pay attention if he said certain things. ... That's who Malcolm-Jamal was.\"",
      "The news of Warner's death was \"devastating,\" a spokesperson for Bill Cosby said. The spokesperson, Andrew Wyatt, said Cosby compared it to learning of the death of his son Ennis, who was shot and killed in a robbery in 1997. \"It felt the same way,\" Wyatt said.",
      "Cosby shared a memory of Warner with CBS News' Jericka Duncan on Monday, saying, \"He was never afraid to go to his room and study and make sure he followed whatever he had learned in the acting school he went to.\"",
      "He said they had last spoken about three months ago, when they chatted about Warner's successful pivot to music. \"He was very proud of what he had done,\" Cosby said.",

      "\"Pepsi Prebiotic Cola represents the next leap forward in giving consumers choice, optionality and functional ingredients in their cola experience, without sacrificing the iconic Pepsi taste we're known for delivering,\" Ram Krishnan, CEO of PepsiCo Beverages U.S., said in a\u00a0statement.",

Tea lets users run background checks on potential matches, check to see if they have criminal records or appear on sex offender databases, and more, all through the app.",
      "The app also ensures that users who sign up are women by requesting that they submit a selfie for verification. That's aimed at protecting users against so-called catfishing schemes, in which people create fake online personas, often as part of a scheme to defraud others.",

      "\"If inaccurate information about a man is being shared, that damages his dating prospects and social reputation,\" Zytko said. \"That's scary, but it's not a reason to discount the app.\"",

The decision removes a final hurdle for the media and entertainment companies to close their transaction. Paramount is the parent company of CBS.",
      "\"Americans no longer trust the legacy national news media to report fully, accurately, and fairly,\" FCC Chair Brendan Carr said in a statement. \"It is time for a change. That is why I welcome Skydance's commitment to make significant changes at the once storied CBS broadcast network.\"",
      "He referenced Skydance's commitment to hire a CBS News ombudsman to review complaints of editorial bias for a period of at least two years. Skydance also affirmed that the company will not have DEI initiatives.",

      "The companies said in a statement Friday that the transaction is expected to close on Aug. 7.",

The deal followed a long, turbulent sales process that drew interest from other major corporate players and investors, including Seagram heir Edgar Bronfman Jr., media mogul Barry Diller, Sony Pictures and private equity firm Apollo Global Management, and Allen Media, the company controlled by former comedian Byron Allen.",

The company agreed to pay $16 million \u2014 most of which would go to Mr. Trump's presidential library \u2014 and agreed to publish transcripts of future \"60 Minutes\" interviews with presidential candidates after those interviews air on the show. Mr. Trump has since said he expects Paramount's new owners to offer him about $20 million in advertising and PSAs. Paramount said in a statement it had no knowledge of any commitments to Mr. Trump outside of its $16 million settlement, and Skydance didn't respond to requests for comment.",

    "summary": "With the Trump administration setting 15% as a floor for tariffs, companies and economists are warning of higher prices later this year.",
    "story": [
      "The new normal for U.S. tariffs on foreign goods starts at 15%. Even as President Trump seeks to forge new terms of trade\u00a0with Japan, the European Union and other global economic partners, he is raising the floor for tariffs to their highest level in decades.",
      "Speaking\u00a0at an AI summit on Wednesday, Mr. Trump said \"we'll have a straight, simple tariff of anywhere between 15% and 50%,\" conditioning the lower rate on countries opening their economies to the U.S.",
      "The White House has said sharply higher tariffs could take effect on dozens of countries as soon as Aug. 1 unless they ink new trade deals. The Trump administration has a separate negotiating timeline with China, which faces an Aug. 12 deadline for an agreement.",
      "As these new rules of international commerce take shape, companies across a range of industries are emphasizing that higher tariffs translate into higher operational costs \u2014 and higher prices for consumers.",
      "For example, Nestl\u00e9 on Thursday said it was considering hiking prices for candy bars and other products as tariffs threaten to eat into the food company's profit margins. The same day, Italian fashion brand Moncler said it has already hiked prices for its apparel to offset additional tariff-related costs. And General Electric said this week that proposed U.S. tariffs, should they take effect, would cost the company around $500 million in 2025, noting that it would move to offset those taxes through \"cost controls and pricing actions.\"",

      "\"The administration has consistently maintained that the cost of tariffs will be borne by foreign exporters who rely on access to the American economy, the world's biggest and best consumer market,\" White House spokesman Kush Desai told CBS MoneyWatch in a statement.",
      "Desai also pointed to a recent analysis by the White House's Council of Economic Advisers that he said shows import prices falling this year.",
      "Price hikes not \"instantaneous\"",
      "Economists warn that consumers should brace for higher prices on a range of goods, from leather products and clothing to electronics and automobiles, later this year.",
      "\"Up to now there has been only limited passthrough from tariffs into final consumer prices, but we still expect the impact to gradually mount in the second half of this year,\" Paul Ashworth, chief North America economist with Capital Economics, told investors in a research note. \"Now that the Trump administration is concluding deals that would see the tariff rate facing most trading partners settling at between 15% and 20%, with even higher rates levied on Chinese imports, we suspect retailers will be forced to finally raise the prices paid by consumers.\"",
      "Inflation in the early part of 2025 remained fairly contained. That's because many companies and consumers accelerated their purchases of imported goods to avoid the risk of paying more if, or when, steep new tariffs take effect.",
      "Meanwhile, in the short-term, sharply higher prices are unlikely across the board, according to trade experts.",
      "\"When you open up the hood of that, it's not going to be even across all categories of spending,\" Ernie Tedeschi, director of economics at the Budget Lab at Yale, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"It's categories of spending where we import more that are going to be more sensitive to tariffs.\"",
      "But over the longer term, an increased baseline tariff, coupled wtih higher levies on individual countries, is projected to drive up U.S. prices by 2% over the next two years, according to an analysis from the Yale Budget Lab.",
      "\"This isn't an instantaneous, 'We wake up the next morning and the world is different,'\" Tedeschi added.",
      "But as the new U.S. tariff regime becomes embedded in global supply chains, some import-heavy product categories could see especially sharp price increases, he said. Specifically, foreign-made leather shoes and handbags, along with apparel, could see prices spike by at least 40%, while the cost of electronics could jump more than 20%, according to the Yale Budget Lab.",

      "Rebate checks have been floated by Mr. Trump previously, with the president saying in February he was considering using 20% of the savings from Elon Musk's cost-cutting task force, the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, to provide direct payments to taxpayers. During the pandemic, taxpayers received three rebate checks \u2014 two under the first Trump administration, and the third under the Biden administration \u2014 aimed at offsetting the economic impact of the crisis.",

      "Washington \u2014 The Trump administration is releasing billions of dollars in grants to schools for adult literacy, English language instruction and other programs, the Education Department said Friday.",
      "President Trump's administration had withheld more than $6 billion in funding on July 1, as part of a review to ensure spending aligned with the White House's priorities.",
      "The funding freeze had been challenged by several lawsuits as educators, members of Congress from both parties and others called for the administration to release money schools rely on for a wide range of programs. Congress had appropriated the money in a bill signed this year by Mr. Trump.",
      "A senior administration official confirmed the release of the funds, and said \"[g]uardrails are in place to ensure these funds will not be used in violation of Executive Orders or administration policy.\" A spokesperson for the Department of Education said the Office of Management and Budget had completed its review of the programs and the money would be begin to be dispersed next week.",
      "Last week, the department said it would release $1.3 billion of the money for after-school and summer programming. Without the money, school districts and nonprofits such as the YMCA and Boys and Girls Club of America had said they would have to close or scale back educational offerings this fall.",
      "The release of that money came days after 10 Republican senators sent a letter imploring the administration to allow frozen education money to be sent to states. Those senators had also called for the rest of the money to be distributed, including funds for adult education and teaching English as a second language.",
      "Republican Sen. Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia was among the lawmakers calling for the release of the grants.",
      "\"The programs are ones that enjoy longstanding, bipartisan support,\" she said. She pointed to after-school and summer programs that allow parents to work while their children learn and classes that help adults gain new skills, contributing to local economies.",
      "In withholding the funds, the Office of Management and Budget had said some of the programs supported a \"radical leftwing agenda. \"",
      "\"We share your concern,\" the GOP senators had written. \"However, we do not believe that is happening with these funds.\"",
      "School superintendents had warned they would have to eliminate academic services without the money. On Friday, AASA, an association of superintendents, thanked members of Congress for pressing to release the money.",
      "In Harford County, Maryland, some of the withheld federal money made up more than half the budget for the district's annual summer camp for kids learning English. The money helps the district hire certified teachers to staff the camp, incorporating learning into children's play for four weeks during the summer. The program helps kids keep their English and academic momentum over the summer.",
      "The district serves roughly 1,100 students who are non-native English speakers. Many of them are born in the U.S. to parents who came to the area seeking job opportunities, often in the restaurants and warehouses that have popped up in the past decades in the region northeast of Baltimore. During the school year, the soon-to-be-released federal money pays for tutors for kids learning English.",
      "On Thursday, more than 350 children filled the second floor of Bel Air High School for the second-to-last day of summer camp. Young learners crowded around an alphabet wheel, jostling with each other to push each letter button as they thought of foods starting with letters from A to Z.",
      "Middle school students watched a robotics team demonstration, and a few sheepishly raised their hands when asked if they would be interested in joining. High school student volunteers, some of whom had been campers learning English themselves not many years ago, helped the youngest children with art projects.",

      "Trade experts say a U.S.-EU agreement could mirror the Trump administration's pact this week with Japan, which imposes a 15% tariff on Japanese imports. In return, Japan has committed to invest $550 billion in the U.S. and further open its domestic market to U.S. exports, including for cars and certain farm products.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump and Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell had a disagreement almost immediately as the two men set foot in the Fed's headquarters in Washington on Thursday to survey an\u00a0extensive renovation project\u00a0on two of the reserve's buildings.",
      "Last week, Mr. Trump indicated that Powell's\u00a0handling of\u00a0the massive project and its cost overruns could be grounds for firing. But on Thursday, Mr. Trump said he doesn't think firing Powell is necessary.",
      "Mr. Trump and Powell appeared side by side on the construction site Thursday \u2014 both in hard hats \u2014 with the president insisting costs have increased further, reaching $3.1 billion. Powell shook his head and said he hadn't heard that figure from anyone at the Fed. Mr. Trump handed a document to Powell, who put on his glasses to review it.",
      "\"You just added in a third building is what that is \u2014 that's a third building,\" Powell said of the Federal Reserve's Martin building.",
      "\"Well, I know but it's a building that's being built,\" Mr. Trump responded.",
      "\"No \u2014 it was built five years ago. We finished Martin five years ago,\" Powell told the president.",
      "\"It's part of the overall work,\" Mr. Trump responded.",
      "\"It's not new,\" Powell reiterated.",
      "Mr. Trump asked Powell if he expects any further cost overruns. Powell said he does not. The project is expected to be completed in 2027.",
      "After a tour of the construction site, Mr. Trump called the project \"a very luxurious situation.\" But asked if the project's cost and overruns are a fireable offense for Powell, Mr. Trump said, \"Look, I would love to see it completed. I don't want to put that in this category. It's a very complex thing that could have been made simple.\"",
      "Mr. Trump said he feels \"good\" about his relationship with Powell and they had a \"productive\" conversation Thursday, but reiterated that interest rates need to come down.",
      "\"I just want to see one thing happen, very simple \u2014 interest rates have to come down,\" he said.",
      "A reporter asked Mr. Trump why he doesn't fire Powell now, instead of replacing him when his term is up in 2026.",
      "\"To do that is a big move, I just don't think it's necessary,\" the president responded. \"And I believe he's going to do the right thing.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has criticized Powell for months because the Fed has kept the short-term interest rate the Fed controls at 4.3% this year \u2014 after cutting it three times last year. Powell says the Fed wants to see how the economy responds to Mr.\u00a0Trump's sweeping tariffs, which Powell says could push up inflation.",
      "Powell's caution has infuriated the president, who has demanded the Fed cut borrowing costs to spur the economy and reduce the interest rates the federal government pays on its debt.",
      "The Fed has been renovating its Washington headquarters and a neighboring building. With some of the construction occurring underground and as building materials have soared in price after inflation spiked in 2021 and 2022, the estimated cost has ballooned to about $2.5 billion from $1.9 billion.",
      "When asked last week if the costly rebuilding could be grounds to fire Powell, Mr. Trump said, \"I think it is.\"",
      "\"When you spend $2.5 billion on, really, a renovation, I think it's really disgraceful,\" the president said.",
      "Firing Powell would threaten the Fed's independence, which has long been supported by most economists and Wall Street investors, and would almost certainly rattle financial markets.",
      "Mr. Trump has at various times referred to his handpicked Fed chair as a \"numbskull,\" a \"Trump Hater\" and a \"stubborn mule.\"",
      "The president asked a group of House Republicans in an Oval Office meeting\u00a0last week\u00a0if he should fire Powell, sources told CBS News. Mr. Trump told reporters a day later it's \"highly unlikely\" he would, though he\u00a0confirmed\u00a0he spoke to lawmakers about \"the concept of firing him\" and \"almost all of them said I should.\"",
      "Renovations have been underway for years",
      "Plans for the Fed's renovation were first approved by the Federal Reserve Board of Governors in 2017. The project then went through several local commissions for approval, at least one of which, the Commission for Fine Arts, included several Trump appointees. The commission\u00a0pushed for more marble\u00a0in the second of the two buildings the Fed is renovating, known as 1951 Constitution Avenue, specifically in a mostly glass extension that some of Trump's appointees derided as a \"glass box.\"",
      "The National Planning Commission, another local body, pushed the Fed to add marble to a rooftop addition.",
      "Fed staff also said tariffs and inflationary increases in building material costs also drove up costs. Mr. Trump in 2018 imposed a 25% duty on steel and 10% on aluminum. Steel prices are up about 60% since the plans were approved in June, while construction materials costs overall are up about 50%, according to government data.",
      "Fed staff also pointed to the complication of historic renovations \u2014 both buildings have significant preservation needs. Constructing a new building on an empty site would have been cheaper.",

    "story": [
      "AI gets a lot of attention for eliminating human jobs, but more and more it is also creating them.",
      "The number of job postings that mention artificial intelligence has climbed in recent years as employers seek workers versed in AI, a recent\u00a0report\u00a0from the Brookings Institution shows, In the last year alone, AI-themed job postings increased by over 100%, the Washington, D.C.-based think tank found.",
      "AI-related job postings have grown at an average annual rate of nearly 29% over the last 15 years \u2014 that outstrips the 11% rate of postings in the general economy, said Brookings, which based its findings on data from labor market analytics firm Lightcast.",
      "Demand for AI expertise is growing as more companies start to integrate AI into their workflows. The share of companies using AI in the manufacturing sector has more than doubled from 4% in early 2023 to roughly 9% as of mid-2025, according to Brookings, citing data from the U.S. Census Bureau's Business Trends and Outlook Survey (BTOS).",
      "Yet while AI job growth has accelerated in recent years, it makes up only a small fraction of the labor market overall. Investment bank Goldman Sachs estimates the peak pace of adoption will hit in the early 2030s.",
      "\"AI is definitely visible in the micro labor market data, but it doesn't look like it's driving the overall labor market dynamic,\" said Joseph Briggs, a senior global economist at Goldman Sachs.",
      "What kind of AI jobs?",
      "The burgeoning AI job market involves a mix of skill sets ranging from advanced AI-specific roles, such as AI engineers, to more general AI-related positions such as software developers, according to Elena Magrini, global head of research at Lightcast.",
      "In 2025, more than 80,000 job postings mentioned generative AI skills, up from 3,780 in 2010, \u00a0according to Brookings.",
      "Cory Stahle, an economist at the Indeed Hiring Lab, said in an email to CBS MoneyWatch that the accelerating adoption of AI by businesses is spurring demand for consultants who can help companies integrate AI. Job listings relating to so-called responsible AI\u00a0jobs, which focus on the ethical use of AI tools in business and society, are also on the rise, according to Indeed.",
      "\"In other words, the definition of what it means to be an 'AI job' is changing every day as businesses find new and creative ways to incorporate the technology responsibly,\" Stahle said.",
      "AI positions may prove an especially appealing sector of the U.S. labor market given that they tend to be associated with higher salaries. Job postings that mention AI skills pay an average of $18,000, or 28%, more per year than for similar roles that don't require AI skills, according to a separate report from Lightcast.",
      "Where are AI jobs to be found?",
      "Unsurprisingly, AI job growth tends to be concentrated in tech hubs like Silicon Valley, which accounts for 13% of all AI-related job postings. Seattle accounts for 7% according to data from Lightcast.",
      "But AI jobs are starting to surface in other parts of the country including the Sunbelt and along the East Coast between Boston and Washington, D.C. said Mark Muro, a senior fellow at Brookings Metro. Universities have also been a catalyst for AI job growth, he noted.",
      "Magrini noted that AI skills are increasingly required in other non-tech fields like marketing, human resources and finance. Over half of job postings requesting AI skills in 2024 were outside IT and computer science, according to Lightcast data.",
      "While uptake is uneven across geographic areas, Muro said he expects AI adoption by employers to increase more rapidly in the coming years as they figure out its benefits and limitations.",
      "\"There does seem to be good consensus that this is very important for productivity and that it does really energize regional leaders and business people,\" he said.",

      "The reversal of the policy to eliminate paper checks comes after Senator Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat from Massachusetts, met with Social Security Commissioner Frank Bisignano on Wednesday morning and asked about the plan to discontinue paper checks, along with other changes at the agency.",
      "\"There are about 600,000 Americans who still receive their paper checks \u2014 it's a small fraction of people who receive Social Security payments, but it's a population that often needs checks through paper\" versus electronic deposit, Warren said in a press call to discuss her meeting with Bisignano.",

      "Focus on customer service",

It's expected to include a mix of both personal time and political business. As was the case during his last visit as president in 2018, he is likely to be greeted by protests everywhere he goes in his mother's native land.",
      "The plan is for Mr. Trump to pay visits to his two luxury golf resorts in Scotland, Trump International on the east coast of Aberdeenshire, which he bought in 2012, and Trump Turnberry in Ayrshire, about 200 miles away on the west coast, which he purchased in 2014.",

Some Scots believe the American real estate mogul-turned-president has been good for the country, bringing in investment and with it, some employment, but others criticize the policies he has adopted during his second term.",
      "In advance of Mr. Trump's arrival, the Stop Trump Scotland protest group has been organizing demonstrations at Aberdeen and outside the U.S. consulate in Scotland's capital, Edinburgh \u2014 part of a so-called \"Festival of Resistance\" that aims to mix city-based actions with countryside activism around Mr. Trump's golf resorts.",

But with that in mind, we've got a really experienced team of officers working as part of planning the operation.\"",
      "During Mr. Trump's 2018 trip to Scotland, CBS News' partner network BBC News says there were more than 5,000 police officers deployed, with the U.K. Treasury chipping in about \u00a35 million ($6.8 million) to help cover the costs to the Scottish police force.",
      "Trump's visit is private, but with some politics",
      "While he made his preference for Mr. Trump's opponent clear before the last U.S. election, the head of Scotland's government said it was his duty to meet with the U.S. president during his upcoming visit.",
      "\"I've taken a decision that's in Scotland's interest to meet with the president of the United States so that I can use every opportunity to protect and to promote the interests of the people of Scotland,\" Swinney told Britain's PA news agency. \"There's obviously a range of issues that we can cover around the international situation that's causing such anxiety to people in Scotland, around the situation the Middle East, and the situation in Ukraine, and the domestic issues that are important to us around about the implications of, for example, trade and tariffs on some of our key sectors, including Scotch whisky.\"",
      "Mr. Trump is expected to meet on Monday with Prime Minister Starmer, but due to it being officially a private visit, neither the White House nor Starmer's office have revealed much about what the two may do or discuss. For Starmer, however, keeping discussions going about U.S. tariffs imposed since Mr. Trump came back to the White House will likely be a key theme.",
      "President Trump has imposed 25% tariffs on imported British steel. Starmer hopes to get that rate lowered, to zero if possible, to shore up the U.K.'s steel industry, which has seen its output plummet by around 80% since the 1960's.",
      "White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said Wednesday that the two leaders would meet \"to refine the historic U.S.-U.K. trade deal\" brokered in May.",
      "Mr. Trump will return to the U.K. for an unprecedented second official state visit on September 17, during which he is scheduled to meet with King Charles III.

      "The Trump administration and the European Union are racing to clinch a trade deal\u00a0by the White House's self-imposed Aug. 1 deadline, with economists warning that a sharp hike in tariffs could raise costs for consumers and businesses.",
      "As the clock ticks down, a series of pacts with other U.S. trading partners in recent days have raised hopes of avoiding a potentially damaging trade war with Europe, with experts saying a\u00a0deal with Japan announced on Tuesday could serve as a template for a deal with the EU.",

      "For consumers and businesses on both sides of the Atlantic, much is riding on the outcome of the trade talks. Absent a deal, President Trump has threatened to hit imports from the EU's 27 member countries with a 30% tax. In preparing possible countermeasures, the European Commission has said it would impose tariffs on more than $100 billion worth of U.S. goods starting Aug. 7, AFP reported on Wednesday.",
      "Negotiations are ongoing and a U.S.-EU trade war could yet be avoided. Citing EU diplomats, AFP also said officials with the trading block could be open to a 15% U.S. tariff rate, with potential carveouts for key sectors, according to the wire service.",
      "The White House did not immediately respond to questions about the status of talks with the EU, including whether the Trump administration expects to reach a trade deal by the Aug. 1 deadline.",
      "President Trump on Tuesday struck a trade deal with Tokyo that calls for a 15% tariff on Japanese imports. In return, the deal calls for Japan to invest $550 billion in the U.S. and further open its domestic market to U.S. exports, including cars and certain farm products.",
      "The 15% tariff rate on Japanese goods is five percentage points higher than a baseline tariff the Trump administration imposed on all foreign imports on April 2. But it is lower than the 25% he threatened against Japan earlier this month and the 24% duties his administration\u00a0proposed\u00a0in early April.",
      "\"The Japan deal solidifies this pattern we've seen thus far, which is some market access relief, a commitment to purchase U.S. goods, and a slightly lower, but above the universal baseline, tariff level,\" Alex Jacquez, chief of policy and advocacy at Groundwork Collaborative, a public policy research firm, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"The Japan deal certainly provides a framework of what [Mr. Trump] looking for,\" Jacquez said. \"It's about accepting a baseline tariff at or above 10%, and then making purchase commitments.\"",
      "Key catalysts for trade deals",
      "A key element of Mr. Trump's trade deals has been a commitment by other nations to invest in the U.S. The president has defended tariffs as a way to revive the country's domestic manufacturing base and make American exports more competitive, as well as to generate additional federal revenue.",
      "\"We are learning that the promise of greater investment into the U.S. works well with the administration,\" EY Parthenon chief economist Gregory Daco said. \"The promise to invest $550 billion was a big part of the Japan-U.S. trade deal. It was a key catalyst to securing a deal.\"",
      "The EU, whose member states have a combined gross domestic product of $20 trillion, could likely commit to a large investment in the U.S. because it could span a number of years and focus on key sectors, such as technology, energy or artificial intelligence, Daco added.",
      "Additional commitments by the EU to purchase American-made goods and to lower trade barriers to U.S. exports could also help close a deal, he said. \"Those don't cost much, and they're an easy bargaining chip to put forward.\"",
      "Risk of higher prices",
      "Although a 15% baseline U.S. tariff on EU imports would represent a retrenchment from Mr. Trump's earlier threats, it would still drive up prices for U.S. businesses and consumers, according to Daco.",
      "\"While it may seem like a great deal, it's still much higher than the tariffs that the U.S. was imposing at the end of 2024,\" he noted. \"So there would still be a positive inflation shock because of higher tariffs. There would also be demand erosion coming from reduced business investment, hiring,and reduced consumer spending as a result of these higher tariffs.\"",
      "Currently, the average U.S. tariff rate on imports is around 15%, according to his analysis. If Mr. Trump's threatened tariffs go into effect, that rate would rise to more than 20%. If the EU agrees to a 15% tariff rate, however, the average U.S. tariff rate on imports from around the world would drop to 19.5%.",
      "\"That's still a significant increase in the average rate,\" Daco said. \"It's a lot higher than the 2.5% where we started the year.\"",
      "Because most U.S. imports from the EU include industrial inputs like components, raw materials and machinery, any added costs would take tie to work their way through the supply chain, according to Ryan Young, a senior economist at the Competitive Enterprise Institute, a nonpartisan think tank.",
      "\"It would \u00a0affect manufacturing exports faster than it would affect American consumers, but it would raise prices all around,\" Young said.",

They won't take any of our beef. They don't want it because they don't want it to affect their farmers and, you know, I don't blame them, but we're doing the same thing right now.\"",

      "\"We need to give confidence to the industry, but also to you (the public): this is not just about animal welfare, this is about human welfare, this is about BSE potentially coming into this country and having a human impact, so I think it's important the government's very transparent about the science and I don't think it's even beyond the question to have an independent panel review that science to give confidence to everybody,\" he added.",
      "Around 70% of Australian beef is exported. Producers fear that export market would vanish overnight if diseases including mad cow or foot-and-mouth disease infected Australian cattle.",
      "According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, there have been only six BSE cases in U.S. cattle since the major international outbreak of the disease \u2014 which was centered in the U.K. and other European nations \u2014 in the late 1980s and early 1990s. One of those cows was imported from Canada and believed to have been infected there, and the other five, \"were diagnosed with atypical BSE, which many researchers believe to be a sporadic illness not caused by contaminated feed,\" the CDC says.",
      "Will Evans, chief executive of Cattle Australia who represents more than 52,000 grass-fed beef producers across the nation, said he was confident the agriculture department had taken a cautious approach toward U.S. imports.",
      "\"The department's undertaken a technical scientific assessment and we have to put faith in them. They've made this assessment themselves. They've said: 'We've looked at this, we've looked at the best science, this is a decision that we feel comfortable with,'\" Evans said.",

      "Will Australians buy more U.S. beef?",
      "Evans, of Cattle Australia, told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation he wasn't worried about the new government policy flooding Australia's domestic market with American beef. He said the U.S. domestic market currently relieds on imports of Australian beef, which he said was about 50 cents cheaper than U.S. beef per pound.",
      "\"The likelihood of them (U.S.) turning around and looking to Australia as a really high value market [to export to] is very low,\" he said. \"If I was an exporter of U.S. beef, I would be looking at Japan, Korea and China as being really viable and valuable markets. I don't really think Australia rates highly on that list.\"",

      "Beef prices have been rising in the U.S. for years, due to factors including prolonged drought and shrinking domestic herd numbers. The average price of a pound of ground beef in the U.S. rose to $6.12 in June, up nearly 12% from a year ago, according to U.S. government data.

      "Another focus will be on reining in what White House officials have called an \"ideological bias\" in chatbots. This is something Sacks, a former PayPal executive, has highlighted after a 2024 incident in which Google's AI image generator created pictures of Black, Asian and Native American men when asked to show one of the countries Founding Fathers.",
      "\"We believe that AI systems should be free of ideological bias and not be designed to pursue socially engineered agendas,\" Sacks said on Wednesday. \"And so we have a number of proposals there on how to make sure that AI remains truth-seeking and trustworthy.\"",

    "summary": "The Education Department has temporarily paused loan forgiveness for an income-based repayment plan. Here are the details.",
    "story": [
      "Millions of people with student loans who are enrolled in a popular repayment plan are now in limbo, with the Department of Education saying it has temporarily paused forgiveness for borrowers in its income-based repayment plan, or IBR.",
      "Such plans offer a double benefit for borrowers by lowering a person's monthly loan repayment to reflect their income, while also promising to provide forgiveness after a number of years. Specifically, the government can cancel the balance of student loan after people have made payments for at least 20 years.",
      "About 40% of the roughly 33 million people repaying student loans were enrolled in one of the Education Department's four such repayment plans at the end of 2024, according to data from the National Student Loan Data System and the Government Accountability Office.",
      "But three of those programs had previously been halted by a court ruling, while forgiveness for the roughly 2 million people enrolled in the fourth \u2014 IBR \u2014 is now also paused.",
      "On Tuesday, Education Department deputy press secretary Ellen Keast told CBS MoneyWatch that the agency \"has temporarily paused discharges for IBR borrowers in order to comply with ongoing court injunctions regarding the Biden Administration's illegal attempts at student loan forgiveness.\"",
      "The court injunctions stem from 2024\u00a0lawsuits related to the Biden administration's flagship student loan repayment plan, called the\u00a0Saving on a Valuable Education, or SAVE, plan. That initiative, created to fix long-standing issues with the Education Department's previous income-based plans, proved popular with borrowers, with almost 8 million enrollees at the end of 2024, National Student Loan Data System data shows.",
      "Because the SAVE plan could count toward loan discharges in the IBR program, the Education Department is now temporarily halting forgiveness for enrollees in that plan. The Education Department said the loan discharges will resume at some point, but didn't provide a timeframe for when that might occur.",
      "What income-driven repayment plans are legally blocked?",
      "Student loan forgiveness under three of the federal government's income-driven plans \u2014 SAVE; Income-Contingent Repayment (ICR); and Pay As You Earn (PAYE) \u2014 is currently paused after a court ruled last summer that Congress exceeded its authority in approving those plans.",
      "The legal action last year called into question whether student loan forgiveness was authorized under the federal statute that governs those plans. But the IBR plan was created under a different authority.",
      "When will the Education Department start forgiving loans again?",
      "The Education Department didn't specify a timeframe in its statement to CBS MoneyWatch. It noted that the SAVE plan allowed forbearances \u2014 when loan payments are temporarily halted or reduced \u2014 to be counted toward loan forgiveness, but that the rule was halted by the court ruling.",
      "Because of the injunction, the Education Department said it needs to recalculate how many payments made by borrowers should contribute toward repayment.",
      "\"Legal IBR discharges will resume as soon as the Department is able to establish the correct payment count,\" said Keast of the Education Department.",
      "Should a borrower continue making IBR payments for now?",
      "Yes. Borrowers in the federal IBR plan are eligible to have their student loans canceled after making payments for at least 20 years. However, some people eligible for such forgiveness have yet to see their loans canceled. They should continue making those payments, and the Education Department will eventually refund them, according to the agency.",
      "\"For any borrower that makes a payment after the date of borrower eligibility, the Department will refund overpayments when the discharges resume,\" Keast said.",
      "Borrowers can also request forbearance from their loan servicer. In that case, interest would continue to accrue on any remaining balance.",

      "The majority of the world's cocoa supply comes from Ghana and the Ivory Coast, which have faced heatwaves and heavy rain linked to climate change. These unfavorable weather conditions have led to diseases like Black pod rot, which kills cocoa crops. Chronic underinvestment in cocoa farms is another reason behind the spike in cocoa prices,\u00a0according to an article from J.P. Morgan Global Research.",
      "\"Cocoa is a market where the grower produces a very high-value good but receives a very low share of the actual value chain.

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-capital-gains-tax-home-sales/",
    "published": "Tue, 22 Jul 2025 18:23:57 -0400",
    "summary": "President Trump said he's \"thinking about\" eliminating capital gains tax on home sales. Here's what that would mean for the housing market.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump on Tuesday floated the possibility of eliminating the federal capital gains tax on home sales, in a move that would change the way real estate profits are taxed for the first time in 30 years.",
      "Speaking to reporters in the Oval Office on Tuesday, Mr. Trump suggested he is weighing supporting\u00a0legislation\u00a0introduced by Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia that would nix the existing capital gains tax on home sales. Greene called the tax \"an outdated, unfair burden\u2014especially in today's housing market, where values have skyrocketed.\"",
      "\"We're thinking about that,\" Mr. Trump responded to a reporter, when asked how important it is that the capital gains tax be eliminated in order to \"unleash\" the housing market. \"It would also unleash it just by lowering the interest rates,\" the president said, adding, \"If the fed would lower the rates we wouldn't even have to do that. But we are thinking about no tax on capital gains on houses.\"",
      "Currently, single-tax filers can exclude up to $250,000 in capital gains from sales of their primary homes from their taxable incomes under what's called the Section 121\u00a0exclusion. That amount rises to $500,000 for joint filers. Both amounts have remained fixed since 1997.",
      "Reached for comment by CBS MoneyWatch, the White House said it had nothing additional to add to Mr. Trump's comments.",
      "\"Homeowners who have lived in their homes for decades, especially seniors in places where values have surged, shouldn't be forced to stay put because of an IRS penalty,\" Greene said in a statement announcing the proposed No Tax on Home Sales Act. \"My bill unlocks that equity, helps fix the housing shortage, and supports long-term financial security for American families.\"",
      "According to Research from the National Association of Realtors (NAR), the current federal policy on the capital gains tax on home sales is \"quietly distorting the housing market\" by \"locking in older homeowners, and strangling inventory just when America needs it most.\"",
      "\"Stay-put penalty\"",
      "A NAR study found that 34% of homeowners, or 29 million Americans, would exceed the $250,000 threshold were they to sell their homes, while 10%, or eight million Americans, would surpass the $500,000 threshold for joint filers.",
      "As a result, older homeowners are disincentivized to sell their homes, in what NAR researchers refer to as a \"stay-put penalty.\" For example, seniors who might otherwise consider moving closer to family, or downsizing, are staying in place \u2014 and keeping housing inventory tied up.",
      "\"This stagnation in housing turnover is rippling through the entire market, driving up costs and limiting opportunity \u2014 exactly the opposite of what public policy should be encouraging,\" Shannon McGahn, NAR executive vice president and chief advocacy officer,\u00a0 said in a statement. \"And it grows worse each month.\"",
      "Critics say eliminating the tax would only benefit wealthy Americans who can afford to pay tax on gains from home sales that exceed the limit.",
      "Joel Berner, senior economist at Realtor.com, told CBS MoneyWatch that a lot of home sellers already benefit from the $250,000 exclusion limit, and that eliminating the capital gains tax altogether would primarily benefit wealthier Americans who own residences that have appreciated by more than $250,000, or $500,000 in the case of joint filers.",
      "\"It wouldn't really move the needle for a regular family, unless you have a home that's appreciated a lot,\" Berner told CBS MoneyWatch. \"If your home has appreciated by more than $1 million, there would be a benefit to removing the capital gains tax.\"",
      "Inventory release",
      "He also suspects abolishing the capital gains tax on home sales would release inventory onto the housing market.",
      "\"It could be a good thing for the market. In particular where inventory is constrained, it could benefit regular folks,\" Berner said.",
      "By contrast, eliminating the federal tax would also erase revenue paid to the government, and could spark increased interest from investors and speculators, which could also drive up home values. That would contribute to the nation's housing affordability problem, according to Berner.",
      "Nearly 27% of all homes sold in the first three months of the year were bought by investors \u2014 the highest share in at least five years, according to a report by real estate data provider BatchData.",

      "Target is ending a price matching policy that for\u00a012 years\u00a0allowed customers to request a price match if they found an identical item with a lower cost at competitors Amazon or Walmart.",
      "The\u00a0policy\u00a0enabled a price match if shoppers could provide proof of the lower price within 14 days of their purchase. The product had to be identical in brand name, size, weight, color and model number, and had to be sold and fulfilled by Amazon or Walmart, according to the Target policy.",
      "After July 28, customers will only be able to request a price match for products sold at either Target or Target.com, not competitors Amazon and Walmart, according to a Target spokesperson. The company said that it's ending price matching for products sold by the two rival retailers because \"guests overwhelmingly price match Target and not other retailers.\"",
      "Target introduced its competitor price match policy in 2013. At the time, former Target CEO and president Gregg Steinhafel said the policy provided \"unbeatable value.\"",
      "Other retailers that have price matching policies include Best Buy and\u00a0Home Depot. Walmart also has a price matching policy, although it's for Walmart.com, not competitors.",
      "Target's decision to end its price matching policy comes as the retailer is struggling to boost sales and store traffic. In its most recent earnings report released in May, the company reported a nearly 3% decline in sales during the first quarter compared to the same time last year.",
      "At the time, Target CEO Brian Cornell said the retailer was navigating an \"exceptionally challenging environment,\" citing declining consumer confidence and uncertainty around tariffs as some of the headwinds.",

The Conference Board Consumer Confidence Index, which tracks Americans' sentiment toward business and labor market conditions, fell 5.4 points in June, a sign consumers may be more cautious about the state of the economy.",

      "Southwest, which announced last year that it was abandoning open seating, said customers can start booking flights with assigned seats starting on July 29.",
      "\"Assigned seating unlocks new opportunities for our Customers \u2014 including the ability to select Extra Legroom seats \u2014 and removes the uncertainty of not knowing where they will sit in the cabin,\" Tony Roach, executive vice president of customer & brand at Southwest Airlines, said in a statement.",

Robert Garcia, both of California, said the request comes amid Mr. Trump's \"desperate attempts to quell public interest in the release of files\" related to the disgraced financier.",

      "Earlier this month, the Wall Street Journal published a story\u00a0that claimed a letter signed by Mr. Trump was included in the book along with letters from other friends and acquaintances of Epstein. The president has denied the report, calling the letter a \"FAKE.\"",
      "Last week, Mr. Trump filed a libel lawsuit against the Wall Street Journal, the reporters who wrote the story, and its owner, Rupert Murdoch, alleging the paper's claims were \"false, defamatory, unsubstantiated, and disparaging.\" The lawsuit, which also accuses the Journal of \"clear journalistic failures,\" includes two counts of defamation, each seeking at least $10 billion.",

      "Mr. Trump has previously acknowledged a past friendship with Epstein years ago but has said they had a \"falling out.\"",
      "The Trump administration has been facing increased pressure to disclose\u00a0more details on Epstein, who was convicted of soliciting prostitution from a minor in a Florida state court in 2008 under a controversial plea deal that allowed him to serve only 13 months in jail. Last week, Mr. Trump ordered Attorney General Pam Bondi to seek the release of grand jury testimony related to Epstein. One of the Justice Department's requests to unseal grand jury transcripts has been\u00a0denied.",
      "The order from Mr. Trump came after the Justice Department and FBI\u00a0released a memo\u00a0stating that Epstein did not have an incriminating \"client list,\" did not try to blackmail any prominent figures, and died by suicide. The memo drew backlash from across the political spectrum, including from some fervent Trump backers, in part because Bondi and other administration figures had promised to release much more information on Epstein.",

      "The deadline for applications to the program is midnight Friday.",
      "With those deferred resignations, NASA's civil servant workforce would shrink from about 18,000 to 14,000 personnel. This figure also includes about 500 employees who were lost through normal attrition, the agency said.",

      "The\u00a0deferred resignation program\u00a0was a\u00a0buyout program\u00a0introduced across the federal government by the White House's Department of Government Efficiency at the onset of the Trump administration in an effort to slash costs and reduce the size of the federal workforce.",

      "\"They asked about every single, every possible thing you could imagine \u2014 everything,\" he said.",

    "story": [
      "Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche met for a second day with convicted sex trafficker Ghislaine Maxwell, without offering more than a broad rationale for his hours of questioning. Multiple former federal prosecutors told CBS News they were bewildered by his decision to launch into such talks and described the unfolding events as both unorthodox and concerning.",
      "\"She's somebody who has been sentenced by a court to 20 years in prison, and she is likely also desperate to get out from under that sentence,\" said Elizabeth Oyer, a former Justice Department pardon attorney and federal public defender. \"It's hard to really believe that the Justice Department would rely on anything that she might have to say.\"",
      "Oyer suggested that Maxwell was speaking with Blanche \"in the hope that she might be able to cut a deal that will benefit her, and that raises fundamental questions about the credibility of any information she could possibly provide.\"",
      "Maxwell's defense lawyer, David Markus, said after the meeting that she answered everything asked of her \"and she didn't hold anything back.\"",
      "Asked whether Maxwell is seeking a pardon, Markus said, \"We haven't spoken to the president or anybody about a pardon just yet,\" adding, \"We hope he exercises that power in the right and just way.\"",
      "\"It's unprecedented for the deputy attorney general to be directly involved in interviewing someone who's been convicted of a crime and may be interested in cooperating to get leniency,\" one former senior Justice Department official told CBS News on the condition he not be identified. \"It strikes me simply as an effort to address a political concern, which is not what the Justice Department does.\"",
      "Blanche is a senior Justice Department official who previously served as a personal attorney to President Trump. He is also a former federal prosecutor for the Southern District of New York. He announced his decision to travel to Florida to meet with Maxwell after days of public attention swirled around the administration's mixed messaging about the possible release of files on Jeffrey Epstein, who died in jail in 2019 as he was awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges. Maxwell was convicted in 2021 for her role in the trafficking ring.",
      "Several aspects of the Blanche decision appear to break with longstanding Justice Department practices. Among the most concerning, former officials said, is having Blanche conduct the interviews, rather than the line prosecutors who helped win a conviction in the Maxwell case, and who are continuing to combat her efforts to appeal the outcome.",
      "Adding to the complication is that the prosecutor who led the Maxwell case, Maurene Comey, was fired by the Trump administration a week ago.",
      "One former prosecutor said a key reason for having a line prosecutor handle such an interview is their comprehensive knowledge of both Maxwell and the facts of the case against her. Otherwise, this attorney said, it could be very hard to determine whether Maxwell is being truthful \u2014 especially since there were already past questions about her willingness to be fully candid about the misconduct that led to her arrest, and Epstein's.",
      "\"The best way to determine that is to ask questions you already know the answers to,\" the former prosecutor said. \"Todd Blanche is in no position to assess the truth if he doesn't know all the facts.\"",
      "Because Blanche's meetings were occurring behind closed doors, it is unclear if he was accompanied by other Justice Department officials or FBI agents.",
      "The Justice Department has not responded to a request for comment.",
      "Experts told CBS News that meetings of this nature almost always include an FBI agent who can memorialize the discussion in formal interview notes that could later have evidentiary value, if needed.",
      "\"If Blanche was meeting with Maxwell alone, that's obscene malpractice,\" another former federal prosecutor, who had decades of experience, told CBS News. \"He can't testify and become a witness, nor can he write a report of their meeting.\"",
      "Prosecutors are not permitted to write up interview reports and are not sworn law enforcement officers with training to document an interview of this kind.",
      "\"It would be a mess,\" the former official said. \"The first rule of a meeting with a witness is to have an agent present.\"",
      "As another former prosecutor put it: \"This is not typical.\"",
      "\"It's not the most effective way\" to work if the goal is to gather additional evidence or identify potential targets for future prosecution, this person said.",
      "Mr. Trump has never been accused of misconduct in connection with Epstein's criminal activity, and he has consistently said he cut ties with Epstein before Epstein's first arrest in 2006 for his conduct with underage girls.",
      "Mr. Trump has sought to push past the crush of attention on the topic, even referring to it as \"the Jeffrey Epstein hoax.\"",
      "Blanche explained his decision to meet with Maxwell by saying he would \"pursue justice wherever the facts may lead.\"",
      "\"If Ghislane Maxwell has information about anyone who has committed crimes against victims, the FBI and the DOJ will hear what she has to say,\" Blanche said.",
      "Like Oyer, many former federal prosecutors saw the meeting as a political move intended to dampen growing mistrust about the decision not to make public the files connected with Epstein's case. Multiple former prosecutors spoke with CBS News about the matter, but asked not to be identified because they feared retribution against them or their current employers.",

      "The move comes as legislators are holding a series of public hearings through early next week to discuss the proposed changes to congressional boundaries, exchanges that have led to shouting matches and at least one witness being removed from a hearing Thursday night in Austin.",

      "Pritzker's office said Friday he plans to meet with the legislators \"about the Republican attacks to rig elections.\"",
      "But nothing in Texas state law bars legislators from redrawing lines in between censuses, and President Trump has asked Lone Star State Republicans to use their complete control of government to rearrange congressional district boundaries in hopes of winning up to five more seats across the state in next year's elections.

    "story": [
      "A federal appeals court said Wednesday that President Trump's executive order curtailing birthright citizenship is unconstitutional.",
      "The policy, which has been the subject of a complicated monthslong legal back-and-forth, is currently on hold. But Wednesday's decision appears to mark the first time that an appellate court has weighed in on the merits of Mr. Trump's attempt to end birthright citizenship for many children of undocumented immigrants by executive order.",
      "A panel of judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit wrote that Mr. Trump's order is \"invalid because it contradicts the plain language of the Fourteenth Amendment's grant of citizenship to 'all persons born in the United States and subject to the jurisdiction thereof.'\"",
      "White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said in a statement to CBS News: \"The Ninth Circuit misinterpreted the purpose and the text of the 14th Amendment. We look forward to being vindicated on appeal.\"",
      "On Friday, U.S. District Judge Leo Sorokin joined the panel of appellate judges and a federal judge in New Hampshire in blocking the Trump administration's restrictions on birthright citizenship, finding a nationwide injunction on the executive order remains in place, The Associated Press reported.",
      "On the first day of Mr. Trump's second term, he signed an executive order that said people born in the United States should not automatically get citizenship if one parent is undocumented and the other isn't a citizen or green-card holder, or if both parents are in the U.S. on temporary visas. The order directed federal agencies to stop issuing citizenship documents within 30 days to people who fall into those categories.",
      "The order drew a flurry of lawsuits, as most legal experts have said the 14th Amendment \u2014 which was ratified in 1868 \u2014 automatically offers citizenship to virtually everybody born within the U.S., regardless of their parents' immigration status, with extremely narrow exceptions.",
      "The Trump administration argues the citizenship clause of the 14th Amendment does not apply to people whose parents are in the country illegally or temporarily \u2014 citing a clause that says citizenship is granted to those who are \"subject to the jurisdiction\" of the United States. Those parents do not necessarily have \"allegiance\" to the country, the government argues, so they therefore aren't \"subject to the jurisdiction.\"",
      "The 9th Circuit disagreed. It wrote Wednesday that a plain reading of the 14th Amendment suggests that citizenship was meant to be granted to anybody who is \"subject to the laws and authority of the United States.\"",
      "\"The Defendants' proposed interpretation of the Citizenship Clause relies on a network of inferences that are unmoored from the accepted legal principles of 1868,\" the judges wrote.",
      "\"Perhaps the Executive Branch, recognizing that it could not change the Constitution, phrased its Executive Order in terms of a strained and novel interpretation of the Constitution,\" the opinion said.",
      "The issue reached the 9th Circuit after a lower court in Washington state blocked the birthright citizenship executive order in February, responding to a lawsuit from several Democratic states. The Trump administration in March\u00a0appealed that ruling. It reasserted its arguments about who the 14th Amendment applies to, called the ruling \"vastly overbroad\" and argued the states did not have standing to sue over the order.",
      "On Wednesday, the 9th Circuit said the states did have the right to sue, pointing to the risk that states would be financially harmed by a federal policy that narrows who qualifies for citizenship. The appellate judges also upheld the district court's finding that the states are likely to succeed in showing the order violates the Constitution.",
      "The 9th Circuit's ruling was written by Clinton-appointed Judge Ronald Gould, and joined by Obama-appointed Judge Michael Daly Hawkins. A third member of the panel \u2014 Judge Patrick Bumatay, appointed by Mr. Trump in his first term \u2014 dissented in part, writing that the states don't have standing and adding \"it's premature to address the merits of the citizenship question or the scope of the injunction.\"",
      "Supreme Court hasn't weighed in on merits of birthright citizenship \u2014 yet",
      "The birthright citizenship issue reached the Supreme Court earlier this year, but not in a case involving the merits of the Trump administration's policy.",
      "Instead, the Supreme Court weighed in on whether the district courts that issued nationwide blocks against Mr. Trump's executive order were exceeding the scope of their power \u2014 a perennial topic of debate in legal circles that has frustrated presidents of both parties.",
      "The high court's ruling last month limited the use of nationwide injunctions. In a 6-3 decision, it granted a request by the administration to narrow the injunctions against the birthright citizenship order, but \"only to the extent that the injunctions are broader than necessary to provide complete relief.\"",
      "That doesn't mean the birthright citizenship order will take effect. Shortly after the ruling, a New Hampshire court paused the executive order\u00a0nationwide in a lawsuit that was brought as a class action, after the Supreme Court's decision left the door open to that option.",
      "The Supreme Court also did not directly address whether states can still sue over the order. In the case that the 9th Circuit ruled on Wednesday, the government has argued that courts can just block the birthright citizenship order for residents of the states that sued, rather than issuing a nationwide injunction. But the states argue that would provide them with incomplete relief because people move from state to state.",

      "Before leaving for Scotland Friday, Mr. Trump said there's a \"50/50 chance, maybe less than that\" that his administration would reach a trade deal with the EU. Without a deal, Mr. Trump has threatened to hit imports from the EU's 27 member countries with a whopping 30% tariff rate. The president has long been critical of the U.S.-EU trade relationship, claiming the U.S. has been treated unfairly.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Trump administration is releasing billions of dollars in grants to schools for adult literacy, English language instruction and other programs, the Education Department said Friday.",
      "President Trump's administration had withheld more than $6 billion in funding on July 1, as part of a review to ensure spending aligned with the White House's priorities.",
      "The funding freeze had been challenged by several lawsuits as educators, members of Congress from both parties and others called for the administration to release money schools rely on for a wide range of programs. Congress had appropriated the money in a bill signed this year by Mr. Trump.",
      "A senior administration official confirmed the release of the funds, and said \"[g]uardrails are in place to ensure these funds will not be used in violation of Executive Orders or administration policy.\" A spokesperson for the Department of Education said the Office of Management and Budget had completed its review of the programs and the money would be begin to be dispersed next week.",
      "Last week, the department said it would release $1.3 billion of the money for after-school and summer programming. Without the money, school districts and nonprofits such as the YMCA and Boys and Girls Club of America had said they would have to close or scale back educational offerings this fall.",
      "The release of that money came days after 10 Republican senators sent a letter imploring the administration to allow frozen education money to be sent to states. Those senators had also called for the rest of the money to be distributed, including funds for adult education and teaching English as a second language.",
      "Republican Sen. Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia was among the lawmakers calling for the release of the grants.",
      "\"The programs are ones that enjoy longstanding, bipartisan support,\" she said. She pointed to after-school and summer programs that allow parents to work while their children learn and classes that help adults gain new skills, contributing to local economies.",
      "In withholding the funds, the Office of Management and Budget had said some of the programs supported a \"radical leftwing agenda. \"",
      "\"We share your concern,\" the GOP senators had written. \"However, we do not believe that is happening with these funds.\"",
      "School superintendents had warned they would have to eliminate academic services without the money. On Friday, AASA, an association of superintendents, thanked members of Congress for pressing to release the money.",
      "In Harford County, Maryland, some of the withheld federal money made up more than half the budget for the district's annual summer camp for kids learning English. The money helps the district hire certified teachers to staff the camp, incorporating learning into children's play for four weeks during the summer. The program helps kids keep their English and academic momentum over the summer.",
      "The district serves roughly 1,100 students who are non-native English speakers. Many of them are born in the U.S. to parents who came to the area seeking job opportunities, often in the restaurants and warehouses that have popped up in the past decades in the region northeast of Baltimore. During the school year, the soon-to-be-released federal money pays for tutors for kids learning English.",
      "On Thursday, more than 350 children filled the second floor of Bel Air High School for the second-to-last day of summer camp. Young learners crowded around an alphabet wheel, jostling with each other to push each letter button as they thought of foods starting with letters from A to Z.",
      "Middle school students watched a robotics team demonstration, and a few sheepishly raised their hands when asked if they would be interested in joining. High school student volunteers, some of whom had been campers learning English themselves not many years ago, helped the youngest children with art projects.",

      "Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis on Friday announced deportation flights had begun to take off from the so-called Alligator Alcatraz immigration detention facility that his administration set up in the Everglades, saying \"hundreds\" of detainees held at the site had been processed for deportation.",
      "DeSantis, a Republican who has sought to vocally highlight his state's efforts to aid the Trump administration's crackdown on illegal immigration, said several hundred individuals in line for deportation for alleged immigration offenses had been relocated from the Alligator Alcatraz site to other states or straight to their home countries.",
      "\"The whole purpose is to make this be a place that can facilitate increased frequency and numbers of deportations of illegal aliens,\" DeSantis said during a press conference at Alligator Alcatraz, noting the site has a runway that can accommodate deportation planes.",
      "Florida state officials have overseen the construction of the Everglades facility and the detention of individuals there under a cooperation agreement with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, but the deportation process is still overseen by federal officials. During the same event Friday, Garrett Ripa, a top ICE official in Florida, confirmed \"two or three\" deportation flights had taken off from Alligator Alcatraz.",
      "DeSantis said the cadence of flights would increase, citing the tens of billions of dollars Congress recently gave the Trump administration for immigration enforcement and Florida's expanding efforts to leverage state resources and manpower to help federal officials identify, arrest and detain immigrants living illegally in the Sunshine State.",
      "The governor predicted the Justice Department would \"very soon\" approve a plan for Florida National Guard lawyers, known as judge advocates, to gain the powers of federal immigration judges and adjudicate the cases of those detained at Alligator Alcatraz.",
      "Standing next to DeSantis, Larry Keefe, the executive director of Florida's Board of Immigration Enforcement, warned those in the U.S. illegally that there would be a \"surge\" in immigration arrests in the state, saying local law enforcement officials have roughly doubled their capacity to arrest immigrants suspected of violating federal immigration laws.",
      "Keefe said 1,800 Florida troopers deputized as federal immigration agents had been conducting arrests throughout the state. But he added that in the past few days, the Trump administration has issued \"credentials\" to an additional 1,200 sheriff's deputies and 650 state agents to bolster Florida's efforts to assist the federal government's mass deportation campaign.",
      "Under arrangements with ICE known as 287(g) agreements, local and state officials can enforce federal immigration laws to varying degrees that can include the arresting and detaining those in the U.S. unlawfully. Florida law requires state law enforcement agencies to cooperate with federal immigration authorities.",
      "Kevin Guthrie, executive director of the Florida Division of Emergency Management, said Alligator Alcatraz can currently accommodate 2,000 detainees, but that the state is working to expand capacity at the facility to be able to hold 4,000 individuals there.",
      "Guthrie defended conditions at the tent facility, and said state officials were prepared for any storm-related issues during hurricane season. Detainees held at Alligator Alcatraz have reported poor and unsanitary conditions, including food with maggots, not being able to shower regularly and not having access to lawyers, CBS News Miami has reported.",
      "Asked about the hurricane concerns, DeSantis said there's no place in Florida \"totally immune\" from storms, adding that contingency plans were in place.",

      "Trade experts say a U.S.-EU agreement could mirror the Trump administration's pact this week with Japan, which imposes a 15% tariff on Japanese imports. In return, Japan has committed to invest $550 billion in the U.S. and further open its domestic market to U.S. exports, including for cars and certain farm products.",

      "San Diego \u2014 The United States and Mexico have signed an agreement outlining specific steps and a new timetable to clean up the longstanding problem of the Tijuana River pouring sewage across the border and polluting California beaches, officials from both countries announced Thursday.",
      "Billions of gallons of sewage and toxic chemicals from Tijuana have polluted the Pacific Ocean off neighboring Southern California, closing beaches and sickening Navy SEALs who train in the water. That's despite multiple efforts and millions of dollars that have been poured into addressing the problem over decades, including under the first Trump administration.",
      "\"There is a great commitment by the two countries to strengthen cooperation,\" Mexico's Environmental Secretary Alicia B\u00e1rcena said Thursday after meeting with Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin in Mexico City for the signing of the memorandum of understanding.",
      "The accord comes three months after Zeldin flew to San Diego to meet with Mexican officials and visit the border.",
      "\"I smelled what a lot of residents in the community lived through and have to deal with,\" he said Thursday. \"I saw the degradation of the Tijuana River valley. I heard about the beaches that were closed. I met with the Navy Seals, who have had their training impacted. It was a powerful visit all around for me.\"",
      "\"The Trump Administration is proud to deliver this massive environmental and national security win for Americans in the San Diego area who have been living with this disgusting raw sewage flowing into their communities for far too long,\" Zeldin said, according to CBS San Diego affiliate KFMB-TV.",

      "The 120-mile-long Tijuana River runs near the coast in Mexico and crosses into Southern California, where it flows through Navy-owned land and out to the Pacific.",
      "As Tijuana's wastewater treatment plants have aged, its population and industry \u2014 including the manufacturing plants, known as maquiladoras that make U.S. goods \u2014 have boomed. At the same time, there has been an increase in the amount of toxins that have made their way into the river and into San Diego County \u2014 since 2018, more than 100 billion gallons of raw sewage laden with industrial chemicals and trash.",
      "The pollution has sickened not only swimmers, surfers and lifeguards but also schoolchildren, Border Patrol agents and others who don't even go in the water. Scientists say the sewage is vaporized when it foams up and enters the air people breathe.",
      "California beaches near the border have been closed more often than not over the past four years.",
      "Since 2020, more than $653 million in funds have been allocated to address the issue, but the crisis has continued largely because of delays by the Mexican government, Zeldin has said.",
      "Zeldin said this agreement factors in \"population growth, operation and maintenance costs, and other variables that would make this solution durable and long term.\"",
      "He praised the new administration of Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum, who took office last October, for its willingness to address the issue.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump and Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell had a disagreement almost immediately as the two men set foot in the Fed's headquarters in Washington on Thursday to survey an\u00a0extensive renovation project\u00a0on two of the reserve's buildings.",
      "Last week, Mr. Trump indicated that Powell's\u00a0handling of\u00a0the massive project and its cost overruns could be grounds for firing. But on Thursday, Mr. Trump said he doesn't think firing Powell is necessary.",
      "Mr. Trump and Powell appeared side by side on the construction site Thursday \u2014 both in hard hats \u2014 with the president insisting costs have increased further, reaching $3.1 billion. Powell shook his head and said he hadn't heard that figure from anyone at the Fed. Mr. Trump handed a document to Powell, who put on his glasses to review it.",
      "\"You just added in a third building is what that is \u2014 that's a third building,\" Powell said of the Federal Reserve's Martin building.",
      "\"Well, I know but it's a building that's being built,\" Mr. Trump responded.",
      "\"No \u2014 it was built five years ago. We finished Martin five years ago,\" Powell told the president.",
      "\"It's part of the overall work,\" Mr. Trump responded.",
      "\"It's not new,\" Powell reiterated.",
      "Mr. Trump asked Powell if he expects any further cost overruns. Powell said he does not. The project is expected to be completed in 2027.",
      "After a tour of the construction site, Mr. Trump called the project \"a very luxurious situation.\" But asked if the project's cost and overruns are a fireable offense for Powell, Mr. Trump said, \"Look, I would love to see it completed. I don't want to put that in this category. It's a very complex thing that could have been made simple.\"",
      "Mr. Trump said he feels \"good\" about his relationship with Powell and they had a \"productive\" conversation Thursday, but reiterated that interest rates need to come down.",
      "\"I just want to see one thing happen, very simple \u2014 interest rates have to come down,\" he said.",
      "A reporter asked Mr. Trump why he doesn't fire Powell now, instead of replacing him when his term is up in 2026.",
      "\"To do that is a big move, I just don't think it's necessary,\" the president responded. \"And I believe he's going to do the right thing.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has criticized Powell for months because the Fed has kept the short-term interest rate the Fed controls at 4.3% this year \u2014 after cutting it three times last year. Powell says the Fed wants to see how the economy responds to Mr.\u00a0Trump's sweeping tariffs, which Powell says could push up inflation.",
      "Powell's caution has infuriated the president, who has demanded the Fed cut borrowing costs to spur the economy and reduce the interest rates the federal government pays on its debt.",
      "The Fed has been renovating its Washington headquarters and a neighboring building. With some of the construction occurring underground and as building materials have soared in price after inflation spiked in 2021 and 2022, the estimated cost has ballooned to about $2.5 billion from $1.9 billion.",
      "When asked last week if the costly rebuilding could be grounds to fire Powell, Mr. Trump said, \"I think it is.\"",
      "\"When you spend $2.5 billion on, really, a renovation, I think it's really disgraceful,\" the president said.",
      "Firing Powell would threaten the Fed's independence, which has long been supported by most economists and Wall Street investors, and would almost certainly rattle financial markets.",
      "Mr. Trump has at various times referred to his handpicked Fed chair as a \"numbskull,\" a \"Trump Hater\" and a \"stubborn mule.\"",
      "The president asked a group of House Republicans in an Oval Office meeting\u00a0last week\u00a0if he should fire Powell, sources told CBS News. Mr. Trump told reporters a day later it's \"highly unlikely\" he would, though he\u00a0confirmed\u00a0he spoke to lawmakers about \"the concept of firing him\" and \"almost all of them said I should.\"",
      "Renovations have been underway for years",
      "Plans for the Fed's renovation were first approved by the Federal Reserve Board of Governors in 2017. The project then went through several local commissions for approval, at least one of which, the Commission for Fine Arts, included several Trump appointees. The commission\u00a0pushed for more marble\u00a0in the second of the two buildings the Fed is renovating, known as 1951 Constitution Avenue, specifically in a mostly glass extension that some of Trump's appointees derided as a \"glass box.\"",
      "The National Planning Commission, another local body, pushed the Fed to add marble to a rooftop addition.",

    "story": [
      "CIA Director John Ratcliffe \"strongly supports the public release\" this week of highly sensitive documents by Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, according to a CIA spokesperson, who said Ratcliffe \"initiated\" the declassification process after he took the helm at the agency this year.",
      "Gabbard's office publicly released a report drafted in 2017 by Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee on Russian activity during the 2016 election, sparking concerns about risks to sensitive sources and methods. She said Wednesday that the document contained additional evidence that Obama administration officials \"manufactured\" a narrative about Russia's actions that was designed to undercut President Trump.",
      "Gabbard also declassified a swath of documents related to the 2016 election last Friday.",
      "\"CIA Director Ratcliffe strongly supports the public release of HPSCI's report, which was the result of a process initiated by CIA and led by DNI Gabbard,\" the CIA spokesperson said, using an abbreviation for the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence.",
      "\"This effort reflects Director Ratcliffe's continued commitment to elevating the truth and bringing transparency to the American people and would not have been possible without his directive to return it to the committee,\" the spokesperson added.",
      "The House report, which the committee's Republican staff finalized in December 2017 but updated through 2020, was so highly classified that it was stored at CIA headquarters before Ratcliffe sent it back to the House panel and ultimately toward public release, CBS News has learned.",
      "The committee made it available to the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, or ODNI, according to an ODNI official with knowledge of the declassification process. Gabbard would normally have been required to consult with the intelligence agencies that had contributed sensitive information to the report before declassifying it, but Mr. Trump \u2014 who made the decision to declassify the document with relatively few redactions \u2014 was not under the same obligations, the official said.",
      "The report was written in large part by then-committee staffer Kash Patel, now the FBI director, according to one current and one former official. It contained discussions about raw intelligence from a CIA source the agency had recruited in Russia, and questioned whether analysts had sufficiently taken into account the source's motivations, proximity to Putin or potential bias towards Mr. Trump.",
      "The CIA source's information helped inform the January 2017 Intelligence Community Assessment, or ICA, which concluded in part that Russian President Vladimir Putin and the Russian government aspired to help then-candidate Donald Trump's election chances by discrediting Secretary Clinton and publicly contrasting her unfavorably to him. The U.S. exfiltrated a CIA asset from Russia in 2017, CBS News previously confirmed.",
      "That judgment within the ICA has vexed Mr. Trump for years and has been a key focus of Gabbard's recent declassifications.",
      "Gabbard has claimed the documents released by her office reveal a \"treasonous conspiracy\" by Obama-era officials to undermine Mr. Trump during his first term by alleging Russian efforts to help him win in 2016. Gabbard says she has forwarded the records to the Justice Department as part of a criminal referral.",
      "Obama's spokesperson Patrick Rodenbush called Gabbard's accusations \"bizarre\" and \"ridiculous\" earlier this week.",
      "The ICA's judgement about Russian actions in 2016 was also the focus of a recent CIA internal review under Ratcliffe. Released earlier this month, that review contained far fewer of the sensitive details included in the House Republicans' report and said the judgment on Putin's preference for Trump should have been issued with moderate rather than high confidence. But it said it did not dispute the \"quality and credibility\" of the information.",
      "The top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, Sen. Mark Warner, called the release of the House committee's report by Gabbard \"desperate and irresponsible.\" He said it put highly sensitive sources at risk and could disincentivize potential spies from working for the U.S. government.",
      "\"Tell me how you're going to recruit somebody to, in one of our adversarial nations, maybe work with us, if that information is carelessly thrown around,\" Warner said to reporters on Wednesday.",
      "Ratcliffe, who previously served on the House Intelligence Committee as a congressman from Texas, has said one of his primary objectives as CIA director would be to reinvigorate intelligence collection from human sources. Current and former national security officials have said intelligence provided by human sources, known as HUMINT, has dropped off in recent years, as surveillance technologies have become more sophisticated and ubiquitous.",
      "Human sources \u2014 especially those with proximity to world leaders in adversarial countries like Russia, China and North Korea \u2014 are especially prized and especially rare, given how risky, if not life-threatening, it can be for them to provide information to a foreign intelligence agency. Information provided by human sources typically remains classified for decades, often up to 75 years, according to government classification rules.",
      "At his Senate confirmation hearing in January, Ratcliffe said the recruitment of human spies by the CIA is \"not where it needs to be.\"",

Among them is Juan Carlos, an immigrant from Mexico who had lived in the U.S. for 19 years. On June 24, his construction crew stopped at a Home Depot in the City of Industry, California \u2014 near Los Angeles \u2014 to pick up supplies when he was cornered by federal immigration agents.",
      "\"As soon as I saw them, I tried to run,\" said Juan Carlos, who lived in the U.S. for 19 years. His arrest was captured on cell phone video.",
      "He says he spent two weeks in U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention before agreeing to sign deportation paperwork.",
      "\"Los Angeles gave me many things,\" Juan Carlos told CBS News. \"It gave me opportunities. It gave me another kind of life\u2026I felt like I was home. But everything happens for a reason.\"",
      "Video of Juan Carlos' arrest was recorded and posted online by a young woman named Audree. She told CBS News she was shocked by the incident, but hoped posting the video would help his family.",
      "\"What really got to me was I'm sure they had a gut feeling, maybe not to go out that day, but they needed the money,\" she said.",
      "CBS News has spoken to several undocumented immigrants who were arrested by ICE agents, and then after being deported, ended up in a country that they are now unfamiliar with.",
      "In January, the Mexican government announced they had set up shelters along the border with the U.S. preparing for a massive wave of deportees. One of the facilities, Flamingo's, used to be an event space. Pricila Rivas is a binational deportee coordinator for Al Otro Lado, the only nonprofit allowed into the Flamingo's facility.",
      "Rivas says the facility has a capacity of 3,000, but has only held about 100 people at a time.",

      "Even as ICE agents get more aggressive with their tactics, the mass deportations President Trump promised haven't fully materialized.",
      "According to numbers obtained by CBS News this week, ICE is on track to record more than 300,000 removals in President Trump's first year back in office, which would be the highest tally since the Obama administration. However, that number is still well below the one million annual deportations which the Trump administration has targeted. The Department of Homeland Security has tracked over 13,000 self-deportations since the start of Mr. Trump's second term.",
      "One of those who chose to self-deport is Uliser, an immigrant from Cuba. At the age of 15, he says he fatally shot someone and spent the next 19 years in a U.S. prison before being released in 2024. He was issued a deportation order shortly after, and had been attending immigration check-ins regularly. But as immigration enforcement ramped up in the U.S., he worried he might be detained. And since Cuba is not accepting deportees, there was a risk he'd be sent elsewhere.",
      "\"It was a high risk of me, of the United States sending me to Salvador or South Sudan,\" he says, \" it was an easy choice\u2026 letting them send me to a country where I had, no, I didn't have the choice to go to or just deciding, coming over here to Mexico where I'm gonna have better opportunities in life.\"",

However, the data also shows that most of the documented infractions were traffic or immigration offenses. Less than 1% had murder convictions, the documents showed.",
      "Uliser says he feels remorse when stories like his are used to admonish immigrants.",

      "The Social Security Administration said it will continue issuing paper checks to the retirement program's beneficiaries, backing away from a previously announced plan to switch all payments to electronic deposits after Sept. 30.",
      "On Wednesday, the Social Security Administration told CBS MoneyWatch it would continue issuing paper checks for beneficiaries, including recipients of retirement and disability benefits, who have no other means of getting\u00a0payments. But the program will also emphasize the advantages of electronic transfers to its roughly 70 million beneficiaries in an effort to encourage check recipients to switch, a Social Security spokesperson added.",
      "The about-face comes after the agency\u00a0said\u00a0on July 14 that it would phase out paper checks beginning in October, citing the advantages of electronic deposits including faster payment processing and enhanced security. Eliminating paper also saves the federal government money, with checks costing 50 cents each, compared with 15 cents for an electronic funds transfer, the agency said at the time.",
      "The reversal of the policy to eliminate paper checks comes after Senator Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat from Massachusetts, met with Social Security Commissioner Frank Bisignano on Wednesday morning and asked about the plan to discontinue paper checks, along with other changes at the agency.",
      "\"There are about 600,000 Americans who still receive their paper checks \u2014 it's a small fraction of people who receive Social Security payments, but it's a population that often needs checks through paper\" versus electronic deposit, Warren said in a press call to discuss her meeting with Bisignano.",
      "She added that Bisignano \"made a commitment that no one will be left behind and that people who have access to paper checks will get access to paper checks.\"",
      "Millions of people in the U.S. are \"unbanked,\" meaning they lack traditional bank accounts, often because they believe they don't earn enough to qualify for an account or are worried about costs or other issues, according to Bankrate. Typically, these people rely on check-cashing services or other non-bank financial companies, such as PayPal or Venmo, rather than banks.",
      "About one out of every five households headed by someone over the age of 65 is unbanked or underbanked, according to the AARP. People who are underbanked may have a bank account but still primarily rely on alternative banking services, like check cashing establishments, to handle their money.",
      "Focus on customer service",
      "Warren also said she addressed other issues with Bisignano, including concerns that a major workforce reduction at the Social Security Administration this year could affect customer service.",
      "The senator said Bisignano agreed to her request that the agency's inspector general conduct an independent audit to assess the state of customer service at SSA, such as call wait times and how many Social Security recipients are able to reach a human employee when they call for help.",
      "\"More accurate data is absolutely essential to oversight, to holding the Social Security Administration accountable to the job they are required to do,\" Warren said.",
      "On Wednesday, the Social Security Administration said\u00a0customer service is improving, noting that the agency has reduced its phone response time to an average of 18 minutes in 2025, down from 30 minutes in 2024.",

It's expected to include a mix of both personal time and political business. As was the case during his last visit as president in 2018, he is likely to be greeted by protests everywhere he goes in his mother's native land.",
      "The plan is for Mr. Trump to pay visits to his two luxury golf resorts in Scotland, Trump International on the east coast of Aberdeenshire, which he bought in 2012, and Trump Turnberry in Ayrshire, about 200 miles away on the west coast, which he purchased in 2014.",
      "During his visit, he's also set to meet Scotland's top official, First Minister John Swinney, who publicly backed Kamala Harris' presidential bid against Mr. Trump last year.",

      "But despite his ancestry, Mr. Trump can likely expect a lukewarm to cold reception on Scottish soil. Some Scots believe the American real estate mogul-turned-president has been good for the country, bringing in investment and with it, some employment, but others criticize the policies he has adopted during his second term.",
      "In advance of Mr. Trump's arrival, the Stop Trump Scotland protest group has been organizing demonstrations at Aberdeen and outside the U.S. consulate in Scotland's capital, Edinburgh \u2014 part of a so-called \"Festival of Resistance\" that aims to mix city-based actions with countryside activism around Mr. Trump's golf resorts.",
      "The demonstrations are slated to include large banners and messages in the sand of Scotland's coastline, intended to be visible to the president as he lands",

      "\"There's a broad range of considerations,\" said Police Scotland Assistant Chief Constable Emma Bond. \"It would be inappropriate for me to plan an operation and not bear in mind what has happened in other parts of the world. But with that in mind, we've got a really experienced team of officers working as part of planning the operation.\"",
      "During Mr. Trump's 2018 trip to Scotland, CBS News' partner network BBC News says there were more than 5,000 police officers deployed, with the U.K. Treasury chipping in about \u00a35 million ($6.8 million) to help cover the costs to the Scottish police force.",
      "Trump's visit is private, but with some politics",
      "While he made his preference for Mr. Trump's opponent clear before the last U.S. election, the head of Scotland's government said it was his duty to meet with the U.S. president during his upcoming visit.",
      "\"I've taken a decision that's in Scotland's interest to meet with the president of the United States so that I can use every opportunity to protect and to promote the interests of the people of Scotland,\" Swinney told Britain's PA news agency. \"There's obviously a range of issues that we can cover around the international situation that's causing such anxiety to people in Scotland, around the situation the Middle East, and the situation in Ukraine, and the domestic issues that are important to us around about the implications of, for example, trade and tariffs on some of our key sectors, including Scotch whisky.\"",
      "Mr. Trump is expected to meet on Monday with Prime Minister Starmer, but due to it being officially a private visit, neither the White House nor Starmer's office have revealed much about what the two may do or discuss. For Starmer, however, keeping discussions going about U.S. tariffs imposed since Mr. Trump came back to the White House will likely be a key theme.",
      "President Trump has imposed 25% tariffs on imported British steel. Starmer hopes to get that rate lowered, to zero if possible, to shore up the U.K.'s steel industry, which has seen its output plummet by around 80% since the 1960's.",
      "White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said Wednesday that the two leaders would meet \"to refine the historic U.S.-U.K. trade deal\" brokered in May.",

      "No question is too small when Kayla Chege, a high school student in Kansas, is using artificial intelligence.",

      "The sophomore honors student makes a point not to have chatbots do her homework and tries to limit her interactions to mundane questions.

      "For the past couple of years, concerns about cheating at school have dominated the conversation around kids and AI. But artificial intelligence is playing a much larger role in many of their lives. AI, teens say, has become a go-to source for personal advice, emotional support, everyday decision-making and problem-solving.",
      "\"AI is always available. It never gets bored with you.\"",
      "More than 70% of teens have used AI companions and half use them regularly, with 34% reporting daily usage or multiple times a week, according to\u00a0a new study\u00a0from Common Sense Media, a group that studies and advocates for using screens and digital media sensibly.",
      "The study defines AI companions as platforms designed to serve as \"digital friends,\" like Character. AI or Replika, which can be customized with specific traits or personalities and can offer emotional support, companionship and conversations that can feel human-like. But popular sites like ChatGPT and Claude, which mainly answer questions, are being used in the same way, the researchers say.",
      "In an interview with \"CBS Evening News\" on Wednesday, Common Sense founder and CEO Jim Steyer said what struck him about the study is that AI companions are \"everywhere in teens' lives.\"",
      "Common Sense's study also found that 11% of teens use AI companions to build up their courage and stand up for themselves, which Steyer said can be a good thing. However, he cautioned that problems arise when the technology replaces human relationships.",
      "\"Younger kids really trust these AI companions to be like friends or parents or therapists,\" Steyer said. \"They're talking about serious relationships, and these are robots. They're not human beings.\"",
      "As the technology rapidly gets more sophisticated, teenagers and experts worry about AI's potential to redefine human relationships and exacerbate crises of loneliness and youth mental health.",
      "\"AI is always available. It never gets bored with you. It's never judgmental,\" says Ganesh Nair, an 18-year-old in Arkansas. \"When you're talking to AI, you are always right. You're always interesting. You are always emotionally justified.\"",
      "All that used to be appealing, but as Nair heads to college this fall, he wants to step back from using AI. Nair got spooked after a high school friend who relied on an \"AI companion\" for heart-to-heart conversations with his girlfriend later had the chatbot write the breakup text ending his two-year relationship.",
      "\"That felt a little bit dystopian, that a computer generated the end to a real relationship,\" said Nair. \"It's almost like we are allowing computers to replace our relationships with people.\"",
      "How many teens are using AI? New study stuns researchers",
      "In the Common Sense Media survey, 31% of teens said their conversations with AI companions were \"as satisfying or more satisfying\" than talking with real friends. Even though half of teens said they distrust AI's advice, 33% had discussed serious or important issues with AI instead of real people.",
      "Those findings are worrisome, says Michael Robb, the study's lead author and head researcher at Common Sense, and should send a warning to parents, teachers and policymakers. The now-booming and largely unregulated AI industry is becoming as integrated with adolescence as smartphones and social media are.",
      "\"It's eye-opening,\" said Robb. \"When we set out to do this survey, we had no understanding of how many kids are actually using AI companions.\" The study polled more than 1,000 teens nationwide in April and May.",
      "Adolescence is a critical time for developing identity, social skills and independence, Robb said, and AI companions should complement \u2014 not replace \u2014 real-world interactions.",
      "\"If teens are developing social skills on AI platforms where they are constantly being validated, not being challenged, not learning to read social cues or understand somebody else's perspective, they are not going to be adequately prepared in the real world,\" he said.",
      "When asked whether the issue at play is with the AI technology itself or the way kids live in the modern world today, Steyer said he believes it's both.",
      "\"It's a challenge with how kids live today because they spend so many hours in front of a screen, and when you substitute a machine or a robot for human interaction, you're fundamentally changing the nature of that relationship,\" Steyer told CBS News.",
      "The nonprofit analyzed several popular AI companions in a \"risk assessment,\" finding ineffective age restrictions and that the platforms can produce sexual material, give dangerous advice and offer harmful content. While Common Sense's CEO said he supports the growth and innovation of AI, the group doesn't recommend that minors use AI companions.",
      "\"In terms of its impact on young people, and on families in general, [the study] is an extraordinary finding and one that I think makes us very concerned about kids under the age of 18 being exposed to these kinds of companions,\" Steyer said.",
      "A concerning trend to teens and adults alike",
      "Researchers and educators worry about the cognitive costs for youth who rely heavily on AI, especially in their creativity, critical thinking and social skills. The potential dangers of children forming relationships with chatbots gained national attention last year when a 14-year-old Florida boy died by suicide after developing an emotional attachment to a Character. AI chatbot.",
      "\"Parents really have no idea this is happening,\" said Eva Telzer, a psychology and neuroscience professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. \"All of us are struck by how quickly this blew up.\" Telzer is leading multiple studies on youth and AI, a new research area with limited data.",
      "Telzer's research has found that children as young as 8 are using generative AI and also found that teens are using AI to explore their sexuality and for companionship. In focus groups, Telzer found that one of the top apps teens frequent is SpicyChat AI, a free role-playing app intended for adults.",
      "Many teens also say they use chatbots to write emails or messages to strike the right tone in sensitive situations.",
      "\"One of the concerns that comes up is that they no longer have trust in themselves to make a decision,\" said Telzer. \"They need feedback from AI before feeling like they can check off the box that an idea is OK or not.\"",
      "Arkansas teen Bruce Perry, 17, says he relates to that and relies on AI tools to craft outlines and proofread essays for his English class.",
      "\"If you tell me to plan out an essay, I would think of going to ChatGPT before getting out a pencil,\" Perry said. He uses AI daily and has asked chatbots for advice in social situations, to help him decide what to wear and to write emails to teachers, saying AI articulates his thoughts faster.",
      "Perry says he feels fortunate that AI companions were not around when he was younger.",
      "\"I'm worried that kids could get lost in this,\" Perry said. \"I could see a kid that grows up with AI not seeing a reason to go to the park or try to make a friend.\"",
      "Other teens agree, saying the issues with AI and its effect on children's mental health are different from those of social media.",
      "\"Social media complemented the need people have to be seen, to be known, to meet new people,\" Nair said. \"I think AI complements another need that runs a lot deeper \u2014 our need for attachment and our need to feel emotions. It feeds off of that.\"",
      "\"It's the new addiction,\" Nair added. \"That's how I see it.\"",

      "Sydney \u2014 Humans beat generative AI models made by Google and OpenAI at a top international mathematics competition, but the programs reached gold-level scores for the first time, and the rate at which they are improving may be cause for some human introspection.",
      "Neither of the AI models scored full marks \u2014 unlike five young people at the International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO), a prestigious annual competition where participants must be under 20 years old.",
      "Google said Monday that an advanced version of its Gemini chatbot had solved five out of the six math problems set at the IMO, held in Australia's Queensland this month.",
      "\"We can confirm that Google DeepMind has reached the much-desired milestone, earning 35 out of a possible 42 points - a gold medal score,\" the U.S. tech giant cited IMO president Gregor Dolinar as saying. \"Their solutions were astonishing in many respects. IMO graders found them to be clear, precise and most of them easy to follow.\"",
      "Around 10% of human contestants won gold-level medals, and five received perfect scores of 42 points.",
      "U.S. ChatGPT maker OpenAI said its experimental reasoning model had also scored a gold-level 35 points on the test.",
      "The result \"achieved a longstanding grand challenge in AI\" at \"the world's most prestigious math competition,\" OpenAI researcher Alexander Wei said in a social media post.",
      "\"We evaluated our models on the 2025 IMO problems under the same rules as human contestants,\" he said. \"For each problem, three former IMO medalists independently graded the model's submitted proof.\"",
      "Google achieved a silver-medal score at last year's IMO in the city of Bath, in southwest England, solving four of the six problems.",
      "That took two to three days of computation \u2014 far longer than this year, when its Gemini model solved the problems within the 4.5-hour time limit, it said.",
      "The IMO said tech companies had \"privately tested closed-source AI models on this year's problems,\" the same ones faced by 641 competing students from 112 countries.",
      "\"It is very exciting to see progress in the mathematical capabilities of AI models,\" said IMO president Dolinar.",
      "Contest organizers could not verify how much computing power had been used by the AI models or whether there had been human involvement, he noted.",
      "In an interview with CBS' 60 Minutes earlier this year, one of Google's leading AI researchers predicted that within just five to 10 years, computers would be made that have human-level cognitive abilities \u2014 a landmark known as \"artificial general intelligence.\"",
      "Google DeepMind CEO\u00a0Demis Hassabis predicted\u00a0that AI technology was on track to understand the world in nuanced ways, and to not only solve important problems, but even to develop a sense of imagination, within a decade, thanks to an increase in investment.",
      "\"It's moving incredibly fast,\" Hassabis said. \"I think we are on some kind of exponential curve of improvement. Of course, the success of the field in the last few years has attracted even more attention, more resources, more talent. So that's adding to the, to this exponential progress.\"",

    "story": [
      "SpaceX launched twin satellites for NASA Wednesday that will study how the electrically-charged solar wind interacts with Earth's magnetic field, creating constantly changing and occasionally dangerous \"space weather\" affecting satellites, electrical grids and other critical systems.",
      "The identical TRACERS satellites will operate in the magnetosphere, \"the region around our Earth that is dominated by the planet's magnetic field, and it protects us from the stellar radiation and really from everything else that's going on in space,\" said Joseph Westlake, director of NASA's solar physics division.",
      "\"What we will learn from TRACERS is critical for the understanding and eventually the predicting of how energy from our sun impacts the Earth and our space and ground-based assets, whether it be GPS or communication signals, power grids, space assets and our astronauts working up in space.",
      "\"It's going to help us keep our way of life safe here on Earth.\"",
      "Hitching a ride to space along with TRACERS atop a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket were five other small satellites, including one that will use a new \"polylingual\" terminal to communicate with multiple other satellites and space probes using different protocols.",
      "Another will collect data about how much solar energy Earth absorbs and reemits into space, known as the \"radiation budget,\" and another that will focus on how high-energy \"killer electrons\" are knocked out of the Van Allen radiation belts to rain down into the atmosphere.",
      "Two other small satellites were aboard, including an experimental \"cubesat\" that will test high-speed 5G communications technology in space and another built by an Australian company carrying five small satellites to test space-based air-traffic management technology that could provide aircraft tracking and communications anywhere in the world.",
      "The mission got underway at 2:13 p.m. EDT when a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket roared to life at launch complex 4E at Vandenberg Space Force Base on the California coast. The launching one day late because of a regional power outage Tuesday that interrupted air traffic communications over the Pacific Ocean near Vandenberg.",
      "The second time around, the countdown ticked smoothly to zero and after boosting the upper stage and payloads out of the lower atmosphere, the first stage peeled away, reversed course and flew back to a landing near the launch pad.",
      "A few seconds later, the upper stage engine shut down to put the vehicle in its planned preliminary orbit. The two satellites making up the primary TRACERS payload were deployed about an hour-and-a-half after launch.",
      "Two of the other smallsats were to be released earlier in a slightly different orbit, with the remainder following TRACERS a few minutes later.",
      "TRACERS is an acronym for Tandem Reconnection and Cusp Electrodynamics Reconnaissance Satellites. The twin spacecraft, built by Boeing, will fly in tandem in the same orbit, 10 seconds to two minutes apart, helping researchers precisely measure rapid changes indicating how the solar wind \"couples\" with Earth's magnetic field.",
      "\"So the Sun is a burning, fiery ball of plasma and as it burns, it blows off an exhaust that we call the solar wind, it's a plasma, and that's always streaming from the sun towards the Earth,\" said David Miles, principal investigator at the University of Iowa.",
      "\"And sometimes, the magnetic field of the Earth basically stands it off in the same way that if you have a rock in a stream, the water kind of flows around it. But other times, those two systems couple (and) you dump mass, energy and momentum into the Earth system.\"",
      "That coupling drives spectacular auroral displays, \"but it also drives some of the negative things that we want to... understand and mitigate, like unplanned electrical currents in our electrical grids that can potentially cause accelerated aging in electrical pipelines, disruption of GPS, things like that.\"",
      "\"So what we're looking at trying to understand is how the coupling between those systems changes in space and in time,\" Miles said.",
      "The goals of the other satellites launched Wednesday range from basic science to technology development. The Polylingual Experimental Terminal, or PExT, will test equipment capable of sending and receiving data from multiple government and commercial satellites across multiple communications protocols.",
      "The goal is to streamline communications to and from a wide variety of satellites and space probes to improve efficiency and lower costs.",
      "Another satellite, known as Athena-EPIC, will continue ongoing measurements of Earth's radiation budget, the balance between solar energy coming into Earth's environment compared to the energy radiated back out into space.",
      "Using spare parts from earlier missions, Athena-EPIC will test innovative LEGO-like satellite components intended to lower costs while reducing the size of satellites.",
      "The Relativistic Atmospheric Loss, or REAL, satellite, another small cubesat, will study how electrons in the Van Allen radiation belts get knocked out of place to pose threats to satellites and other systems. Robyn Millan of Dartmouth College is the principal investigator.",
      "\"The radiation belts are a region surrounding the Earth that are filled with high-energy charged particles that are traveling at near the speed of light,\" she said. \"These are sometimes called killer electrons because these particles are a hazard for our satellites in space. They also rain down on our atmosphere where they can contribute to ozone destruction.\"",
      "The REAL cubesat weighs less than 10 pounds and measures just a foot long. Despite its small size, \"it carries a powerful particle sensor that will for the first time make very rapid measurements of these electrons as they enter our atmosphere, and this is really critical for understanding what's scattering them.\"",

      "Tea Dating Advice, an app for helping women vet their dates, is also a top app on the Google Play Store, where it's been downloaded more than 100,000 times.",
      "The app's maker says it offers a measure of security for users that traditional dating apps\u00a0don't. Tea doesn't match singles with potential dates; rather, it's a place for women to share information about men they've dated. Tea lets users run background checks on potential matches, check to see if they have criminal records or appear on sex offender databases, and more, all through the app.",
      "The app also ensures that users who sign up are women by requesting that they submit a selfie for verification. That's aimed at protecting users against so-called catfishing schemes, in which people create fake online personas, often as part of a scheme to defraud others.",
      "Tea declined to comment for this article.",

Tea has more than 1.6 million users, according to its website.",
      "\"What this app seems to be doing is centralizing all that into one very large community,\" Doug Zytko, an associate professor at the University of Michigan-Flint who researches human-computer interactions for safety, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Zytko, who has extensively studied dating app designs, said that safety \"has not been prioritized\" for most such tools in the market, which he said helps explain why Tea has struck a chord with women.",
      "\"The dating app safety features that exist are largely reactive in nature. They're not about keeping people safe, but are punitive actions one can take after something has occurred,\" he added.",
      "Zytko also acknowledged the concerns of some men, voiced on forums like Reddit, that Tea users could share false information about them.",
      "\"If inaccurate information about a man is being shared, that damages his dating prospects and social reputation,\" Zytko said. \"That's scary, but it's not a reason to discount the app.\"",
      "Another potential risk is one common to all social media platform, and digital information more broadly. Tea confirmed to CBS News that its app was hacked Friday morning, with bad actors accessing a data storage system containing information, including selfies, that members had uploaded prior to February 2024.",
      "Additionally, hackers accessed almost 60,000 images from posts, plus comments and direct messages, the company said.",

    "summary": "A growing number of employers in tech and other fields are recruiting workers with expertise in AI, labor data shows.",
    "story": [
      "AI gets a lot of attention for eliminating human jobs, but more and more it is also creating them.",
      "The number of job postings that mention artificial intelligence has climbed in recent years as employers seek workers versed in AI, a recent\u00a0report\u00a0from the Brookings Institution shows, In the last year alone, AI-themed job postings increased by over 100%, the Washington, D.C.-based think tank found.",
      "AI-related job postings have grown at an average annual rate of nearly 29% over the last 15 years \u2014 that outstrips the 11% rate of postings in the general economy, said Brookings, which based its findings on data from labor market analytics firm Lightcast.",
      "Demand for AI expertise is growing as more companies start to integrate AI into their workflows. The share of companies using AI in the manufacturing sector has more than doubled from 4% in early 2023 to roughly 9% as of mid-2025, according to Brookings, citing data from the U.S. Census Bureau's Business Trends and Outlook Survey (BTOS).",
      "Yet while AI job growth has accelerated in recent years, it makes up only a small fraction of the labor market overall. Investment bank Goldman Sachs estimates the peak pace of adoption will hit in the early 2030s.",
      "\"AI is definitely visible in the micro labor market data, but it doesn't look like it's driving the overall labor market dynamic,\" said Joseph Briggs, a senior global economist at Goldman Sachs.",
      "What kind of AI jobs?",
      "The burgeoning AI job market involves a mix of skill sets ranging from advanced AI-specific roles, such as AI engineers, to more general AI-related positions such as software developers, according to Elena Magrini, global head of research at Lightcast.",
      "In 2025, more than 80,000 job postings mentioned generative AI skills, up from 3,780 in 2010, \u00a0according to Brookings.",
      "Cory Stahle, an economist at the Indeed Hiring Lab, said in an email to CBS MoneyWatch that the accelerating adoption of AI by businesses is spurring demand for consultants who can help companies integrate AI. Job listings relating to so-called responsible AI\u00a0jobs, which focus on the ethical use of AI tools in business and society, are also on the rise, according to Indeed.",
      "\"In other words, the definition of what it means to be an 'AI job' is changing every day as businesses find new and creative ways to incorporate the technology responsibly,\" Stahle said.",
      "AI positions may prove an especially appealing sector of the U.S. labor market given that they tend to be associated with higher salaries. Job postings that mention AI skills pay an average of $18,000, or 28%, more per year than for similar roles that don't require AI skills, according to a separate report from Lightcast.",
      "Where are AI jobs to be found?",
      "Unsurprisingly, AI job growth tends to be concentrated in tech hubs like Silicon Valley, which accounts for 13% of all AI-related job postings. Seattle accounts for 7% according to data from Lightcast.",
      "But AI jobs are starting to surface in other parts of the country including the Sunbelt and along the East Coast between Boston and Washington, D.C. said Mark Muro, a senior fellow at Brookings Metro. Universities have also been a catalyst for AI job growth, he noted.",
      "Magrini noted that AI skills are increasingly required in other non-tech fields like marketing, human resources and finance. Over half of job postings requesting AI skills in 2024 were outside IT and computer science, according to Lightcast data.",
      "While uptake is uneven across geographic areas, Muro said he expects AI adoption by employers to increase more rapidly in the coming years as they figure out its benefits and limitations.",

    "story": [
      "In 2018, Brian Hofer and his younger brother were driving to visit their parents for Thanksgiving. It should have been a routine trip.",
      "But that evening they found themselves held at gunpoint by a group of law enforcement officers.",
      "The incident was the result of technology gone wrong. Hofer's vehicle had been flagged as stolen by an Automated License Plate Reader \u2014 ALPR \u2014 system. When he drove by, the reader alerted authorities.",
      "\"Your life definitely is different after you have guns pointed at you,\" he said.",
      "This incident is one of over a dozen cases verified by CBS News during a six-month investigation into incidents of wrongful stops and even several instances of ALPR technology being abused.",
      "The consequences of ALPR errors can range from the inconvenient \u2014 such as mistaken toll booth charges \u2014 to the potentially dangerous, such as Hofer's armed detainment. In some instances the technology was improperly used by authorities, such as in Kansas, where law enforcement officers used license plate reader systems to stalk former partners in two separate incidents.",
      "The rise of ALPR systems",
      "In use since at least the\u00a0late 1990s, automated license plate reader systems have advanced quickly in recent years. They now marry high-speed, high-resolution cameras with artificial intelligence to scan every license plate passing through a designated field of vision. The data is then compared against license plate numbers in databases.",
      "Thousands of agencies use these systems daily to scan plates in real time and identify potential matches. Departments use ALPRs as a crime-fighting tool to gather evidence for investigations and reduce crime as well as for traffic compliance.",
      "According to a survey from the Bureau of Justice Statistics, every police department overseeing more than 1 million citizens reported using the technology, as did 90% of sheriff's offices with 500 or more sworn deputies.",
      "Law enforcement officials told CBS News that the technology has allowed them to do their job more efficiently and has helped solve crimes ranging from stolen vehicles to missing persons cases.",
      "Pat Yoes, the national president of The National Fraternal Order of Police, an organization of hundreds of thousands of sworn law enforcement officers, said in an emailed statement to CBS News that ALPRs are \"extraordinarily important in cases where there is an immediate threat to life or safety, as in an abduction or an armed threat driving to a target,\" adding that the information can be valuable in generating leads and closing cases.",
      "He said transparency is key. \"The community should be made aware of the new technology, how it's used in the field, how it contributes to public safety, and how it addresses any privacy concerns,\" he said in the statement. \"Technology like ALPRs is a valuable tool for many law enforcement agencies to make their communities safer.\"",
      "The rise of ALPR systems comes as law enforcement agencies across the country face staffing and recruiting challenges. A 2024 survey by the International Association of Chiefs of Police, a professional association, found that U.S. agencies are operating at a nearly 10% staffing deficit. ALPR technology is one way to help fill this gap in manpower.",
      "Why license plate readers make errors \u2014 what we found",
      "License plate reader errors may occur for a variety of reasons. In some cases, letters or numbers are interpreted incorrectly by the Optical Character Recognition, or OCR, software. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, common issues including glare or misaligned cameras could impact accuracy. CBS News found that mistakes are often due to a mix of machine and human or administrative errors.",
      "In Espa\u00f1ola, New Mexico, a 12-year-old was handcuffed after an ALPR camera misread the last number of a license plate on a vehicle driven by her older sister as a \"7\" instead of the \"2\" it actually ended with, according to a lawsuit filed against the city. A month later, in a separate incident, a 17-year-old honors student was held at gunpoint in Espa\u00f1ola on his way home from school after officers mistook his vehicle for one associated with an individual who was being sought in connection with a string of armed robberies.",
      "In Aurora, Colorado, in 2020, a mother and her family, including her 6-year-old daughter, were pulled over at gunpoint and forced to lie face down on hot pavement. Again, ALPR technology was central to the stop. Police mistakenly flagged their Colorado license plate as matching that of a completely different vehicle from a different state \u2014 a stolen motorcycle registered in Montana. The incident, captured on video and widely condemned, led to a $1.9 million settlement from the city in 2024.",
      "Privacy and accuracy concerns",
      "The ACLU warns ALPR cameras could infringe on civil rights and violate the Constitution's Fourth Amendment by encouraging unreasonable searches. Despite widespread use, there is no federal legislative framework for ALPR use.",
      "Hofer, who has been involved in privacy advocacy for over a decade, is now the executive director of Secure Justice, an organization that aims to reduce government and corporate overreach. He says manual verification is necessary to see whether ALPR \"hits,\" or matches, are accurate. Even so, he said, such checks are insufficient because data errors could cause a plate to \"match\" an incorrect entry in a database.",
      "\"There are billions of scans a day in America. If there's even just a 10% error rate, that means there are so many opportunities for abuse to happen,\" Hofer said.",
      "Some concerned citizens are taking action. Last year, residents of Norfolk, Virginia, filed a federal lawsuit against the city, and in Illinois, two residents have sued the Illinois State Police over ALPR systems, arguing that their use violates Fourth Amendment rights. The latter case was dismissed without prejudice in April.",

    "published": "Thu, 24 Jul 2025 10:10:49 -0400",
    "summary": "Along with launching two NASA probes, the SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket carried five other satellites into orbit with goals ranging from basic science to technology development.",
    "story": [
      "SpaceX launched twin satellites for NASA Wednesday that will study how the electrically-charged solar wind interacts with Earth's magnetic field, creating constantly changing and occasionally dangerous \"space weather\" affecting satellites, electrical grids and other critical systems.",
      "The identical TRACERS satellites will operate in the magnetosphere, \"the region around our Earth that is dominated by the planet's magnetic field, and it protects us from the stellar radiation and really from everything else that's going on in space,\" said Joseph Westlake, director of NASA's solar physics division.",
      "\"What we will learn from TRACERS is critical for the understanding and eventually the predicting of how energy from our sun impacts the Earth and our space and ground-based assets, whether it be GPS or communication signals, power grids, space assets and our astronauts working up in space.",
      "\"It's going to help us keep our way of life safe here on Earth.\"",
      "Hitching a ride to space along with TRACERS atop a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket were five other small satellites, including one that will use a new \"polylingual\" terminal to communicate with multiple other satellites and space probes using different protocols.",
      "Another will collect data about how much solar energy Earth absorbs and reemits into space, known as the \"radiation budget,\" and another that will focus on how high-energy \"killer electrons\" are knocked out of the Van Allen radiation belts to rain down into the atmosphere.",
      "Two other small satellites were aboard, including an experimental \"cubesat\" that will test high-speed 5G communications technology in space and another built by an Australian company carrying five small satellites to test space-based air-traffic management technology that could provide aircraft tracking and communications anywhere in the world.",
      "The mission got underway at 2:13 p.m. EDT when a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket roared to life at launch complex 4E at Vandenberg Space Force Base on the California coast. The launching one day late because of a regional power outage Tuesday that interrupted air traffic communications over the Pacific Ocean near Vandenberg.",
      "The second time around, the countdown ticked smoothly to zero and after boosting the upper stage and payloads out of the lower atmosphere, the first stage peeled away, reversed course and flew back to a landing near the launch pad.",
      "A few seconds later, the upper stage engine shut down to put the vehicle in its planned preliminary orbit. The two satellites making up the primary TRACERS payload were deployed about an hour-and-a-half after launch.",
      "Two of the other smallsats were to be released earlier in a slightly different orbit, with the remainder following TRACERS a few minutes later.",
      "TRACERS is an acronym for Tandem Reconnection and Cusp Electrodynamics Reconnaissance Satellites. The twin spacecraft, built by Boeing, will fly in tandem in the same orbit, 10 seconds to two minutes apart, helping researchers precisely measure rapid changes indicating how the solar wind \"couples\" with Earth's magnetic field.",
      "\"So the Sun is a burning, fiery ball of plasma and as it burns, it blows off an exhaust that we call the solar wind, it's a plasma, and that's always streaming from the sun towards the Earth,\" said David Miles, principal investigator at the University of Iowa.",
      "\"And sometimes, the magnetic field of the Earth basically stands it off in the same way that if you have a rock in a stream, the water kind of flows around it. But other times, those two systems couple (and) you dump mass, energy and momentum into the Earth system.\"",
      "That coupling drives spectacular auroral displays, \"but it also drives some of the negative things that we want to... understand and mitigate, like unplanned electrical currents in our electrical grids that can potentially cause accelerated aging in electrical pipelines, disruption of GPS, things like that.\"",
      "\"So what we're looking at trying to understand is how the coupling between those systems changes in space and in time,\" Miles said.",
      "The goals of the other satellites launched Wednesday range from basic science to technology development. The Polylingual Experimental Terminal, or PExT, will test equipment capable of sending and receiving data from multiple government and commercial satellites across multiple communications protocols.",
      "The goal is to streamline communications to and from a wide variety of satellites and space probes to improve efficiency and lower costs.",
      "Another satellite, known as Athena-EPIC, will continue ongoing measurements of Earth's radiation budget, the balance between solar energy coming into Earth's environment compared to the energy radiated back out into space.",
      "Using spare parts from earlier missions, Athena-EPIC will test innovative LEGO-like satellite components intended to lower costs while reducing the size of satellites.",
      "The Relativistic Atmospheric Loss, or REAL, satellite, another small cubesat, will study how electrons in the Van Allen radiation belts get knocked out of place to pose threats to satellites and other systems. Robyn Millan of Dartmouth College is the principal investigator.",
      "\"The radiation belts are a region surrounding the Earth that are filled with high-energy charged particles that are traveling at near the speed of light,\" she said. \"These are sometimes called killer electrons because these particles are a hazard for our satellites in space. They also rain down on our atmosphere where they can contribute to ozone destruction.\"",
      "The REAL cubesat weighs less than 10 pounds and measures just a foot long. Despite its small size, \"it carries a powerful particle sensor that will for the first time make very rapid measurements of these electrons as they enter our atmosphere, and this is really critical for understanding what's scattering them.\"",
      "What makes REAL unique, she said, was the sensor's small size, allowing it to be carried by a cubesat, which \"could enable future missions, especially those requiring constellations of satellites.\"",

      "\"That is what we expect to learn more about during this pilot. Riders may experience longer wait times if women drivers are unavailable or further away. If so, they can choose to wait, reserve a ride with a woman driver for a later time, or choose a ride with any available driver that may not match their preference,\" an Uber spokesperson said in an email to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Riders can also set a preference for women drivers in their Uber settings, which will boost the chances of being paired with a female driver, although such a match isn't guaranteed, the company said.",

While Israel's army says it's allowing aid into the enclave with no limit on the number of trucks that can enter, the\u00a0U.N. says it is hampered\u00a0by Israeli military restrictions on its movements and incidents of criminal looting.",
      "Since easing the blockade in May, Israel has allowed in around 4,500 trucks for the U.N. and other aid groups to distribute, including 2,500 tons of baby food and high-calorie special food for children, Israel's Foreign Ministry said last week.",
      "Israel on Saturday said over 250 trucks carrying aid from the U.N. and other organizations entered Gaza this week. About 600 trucks entered per day during the latest ceasefire that Israel ended in March.",
      "Israel is facing\u00a0increased international pressure\u00a0to alleviate the catastrophic humanitarian crisis in Gaza. More than two dozen Western-aligned countries and more than 100 charity and human rights groups have called for an end to the war, harshly criticizing Israel's blockade and a\u00a0new aid delivery model\u00a0it has rolled out.",
      "For the first time in months, Israel said it is allowing airdrops, as requested by neighboring Jordan. A Jordanian official said the airdrops will mainly be food and milk formula.",
      "Britain plans to work with partners such as Jordan to airdrop aid and evacuate children requiring medical assistance, Prime Minister Keir Starmer's office said Saturday. His office did not give details.",
      "\"Israel must allow aid in over land to end the starvation unfolding in Gaza,\" Starmer said in a post on X. \"The situation is desperate. We are working with Jordan to get aid into Gaza. We are urgently accelerating efforts to evacuate children who need critical medical assistance to the UK for treatment. I am determined to find a pathway to peace.\"",
      "However, the planned airdrops won't do much to help quench the severe food shortages, the head of the United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees warned.",
      "\"Airdrops will not reverse the deepening starvation,\" UNRWA chief Philippe Lazzarini wrote on X on Saturday. \"They are expensive, inefficient & can even kill starving civilians. It is a distraction & screensmoke.\"",

      "At least 53 Palestinians killed by Israeli gunshots and strikes",
      "At least 53 people were killed by Israeli airstrikes and gunshots overnight and into Saturday, according to Palestinian hospital officials and the local ambulance service on Saturday, as ceasefire talks appear to have stalled.",
      "Gunfire killed at least a dozen people waiting for\u00a0aid trucks\u00a0close to the Zikim crossing with Israel in the north, said staff at Shifa hospital, where bodies were taken. Israel's military said it fired warning shots to distance a crowd \"in response to an immediate threat,\" and it was not aware of any casualties.",
      "A witness, Sherif Abu Aisha, said people started running when they saw a light that they thought was from aid trucks, but as they got close, they realized it was Israel's tanks. That's when the army started firing, he told The Associated Press. He said his uncle was among those killed.",
      "\"We went because there is no food ... and nothing was distributed,\" he said.",
      "Elsewhere, those killed in strikes included four people in an apartment building in Gaza City, hospital staff and the ambulance service said. Another Israeli strike killed at least eight people, including four children, in the crowded tent camp of Muwasi in the city of Khan Younis in the south, according to the Nasser hospital, which received the bodies.",
      "Also in Khan Younis, Israeli forces opened fire and killed at least nine people trying to get aid entering Gaza through the Morag corridor, according to the hospital's morgue records. There was no immediate comment from Israel's military.",
      "The strikes come as ceasefire talks between Israel and Hamas have hit a standstill after the U.S and Israel recalled their negotiating teams on Thursday, throwing the future of the talks into further uncertainty.",
      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Friday his government was considering \"alternative options\" to ceasefire talks with Hamas. His comments came as a Hamas official said negotiations were expected to resume next week and portrayed the recall of the Israeli and American delegations as a pressure tactic.",
      "Egypt and Qatar, which are mediating the talks alongside the United States, said the pause was only temporary and that talks would resume, though they did not say when.",
      "For desperate Palestinians, a ceasefire can't come soon enough.",
      "Latest child to starve to death weighed less than when she was born",
      "The body of 5-month-old Zainab Abu Halib arrived at the pediatric department of Nasser Hospital in southern Gaza on Friday. She was already dead.",
      "The girl had weighed over 3 kilograms (6.6 pounds) when she was born, her mother said. When she died, she weighed less than 2 kilograms (4.4 pounds).",
      "A doctor said it was a case of \"severe, severe starvation.\"",
      "Zainab was one of 85 children to die of malnutrition-related causes in Gaza in the past three weeks, according to the latest toll released by the Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry on Saturday. Another 42 adults died of malnutrition-related causes in the same period, the health ministry said.",
      "\"She needed a special baby formula which did not exist in Gaza,\" Zainab's father, Ahmed Abu Halib, told The Associated Press.",
      "Her mother, who also has suffered from malnutrition, said she breastfed the girl for only six weeks before trying to feed her formula.",
      "\"With my daughter's death, many will follow,\" Esraa Abu Halib said. \"Their names are on a list that no one looks at. They are just names and numbers. We are just numbers. Our children, whom we carried for nine months and then gave birth to, have become just numbers.\"",
      "More than 100 people have died in Gaza from malnutrition since the war started, UNICEF said on Thursday, and 80% were children. The charity said screening in the Palestinian enclave had found 6,000 children in a state of acute malnourishment in June alone, marking a 180% increase since February.",
      "A UNICEF spokesperson told CBS News on Saturday that its supply in Gaza of Ready-to-Use Therapeutic Food, used for treating severely acutely malnourished children, is expected to run out in mid-August if more is not allowed in.",

      "\"She was asked maybe about 100 different people. She answered questions about everybody, and she didn't hold anything back,\" Maxwell's attorney David Oscar Markus said Friday.",
      "\"They asked about every single, every possible thing you could imagine \u2014 everything,\" he said.",
      "Maxwell, who is serving a 20-year prison sentence for her role in helping Epstein recruit, groom and abuse underage girls, met Thursday and Friday with Blanche, the deputy attorney general, at the U.S. attorney's office in Tallahassee.",
      "Blanche said Thursday the Justice Department would share more about what the government learned in those meetings \"at the appropriate time.\"",
      "The Trump administration has struggled to deal with the backlash over its handling of Epstein's case after several officials, including President Trump, spent years pressing for the release of more details. But a recent Justice Department review concluded Epstein did not have a \"client list\" and confirmed he died by suicide in 2019 in jail, shortly after he was indicted on federal sex trafficking charges.",
      "The conclusions have angered those who have pushed claims that the files have been concealed to protect Epstein's alleged list of prominent clients.",
      "Mr. Trump has tried to distance himself from Epstein, who was once a friend, and has called the controversy a \"hoax.\"",

      "The most downloaded free app on Apple's App Store currently isn't ChatGPT, Threads or Google. It's Tea, a dating advice app that lets women review men they've gone out with, as well as warn other single women about dates they claim went awry.",
      "Tea Dating Advice, an app for helping women vet their dates, is also a top app on the Google Play Store, where it's been downloaded more than 100,000 times.",
      "The app's maker says it offers a measure of security for users that traditional dating apps\u00a0don't. Tea doesn't match singles with potential dates; rather, it's a place for women to share information about men they've dated. Tea lets users run background checks on potential matches, check to see if they have criminal records or appear on sex offender databases, and more, all through the app.",
      "The app also ensures that users who sign up are women by requesting that they submit a selfie for verification. That's aimed at protecting users against so-called catfishing schemes, in which people create fake online personas, often as part of a scheme to defraud others.",
      "Tea declined to comment for this article.",

Tea has more than 1.6 million users, according to its website.",
      "\"What this app seems to be doing is centralizing all that into one very large community,\" Doug Zytko, an associate professor at the University of Michigan-Flint who researches human-computer interactions for safety, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Zytko, who has extensively studied dating app designs, said that safety \"has not been prioritized\" for most such tools in the market, which he said helps explain why Tea has struck a chord with women.",
      "\"The dating app safety features that exist are largely reactive in nature. They're not about keeping people safe, but are punitive actions one can take after something has occurred,\" he added.",
      "Zytko also acknowledged the concerns of some men, voiced on forums like Reddit, that Tea users could share false information about them.",
      "\"If inaccurate information about a man is being shared, that damages his dating prospects and social reputation,\" Zytko said. \"That's scary, but it's not a reason to discount the app.\"",
      "Another potential risk is one common to all social media platform, and digital information more broadly.

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Trump administration is releasing billions of dollars in grants to schools for adult literacy, English language instruction and other programs, the Education Department said Friday.",
      "President Trump's administration had withheld more than $6 billion in funding on July 1, as part of a review to ensure spending aligned with the White House's priorities.",
      "The funding freeze had been challenged by several lawsuits as educators, members of Congress from both parties and others called for the administration to release money schools rely on for a wide range of programs. Congress had appropriated the money in a bill signed this year by Mr. Trump.",
      "A senior administration official confirmed the release of the funds, and said \"[g]uardrails are in place to ensure these funds will not be used in violation of Executive Orders or administration policy.\" A spokesperson for the Department of Education said the Office of Management and Budget had completed its review of the programs and the money would be begin to be dispersed next week.",
      "Last week, the department said it would release $1.3 billion of the money for after-school and summer programming. Without the money, school districts and nonprofits such as the YMCA and Boys and Girls Club of America had said they would have to close or scale back educational offerings this fall.",
      "The release of that money came days after 10 Republican senators sent a letter imploring the administration to allow frozen education money to be sent to states. Those senators had also called for the rest of the money to be distributed, including funds for adult education and teaching English as a second language.",
      "Republican Sen. Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia was among the lawmakers calling for the release of the grants.",
      "\"The programs are ones that enjoy longstanding, bipartisan support,\" she said. She pointed to after-school and summer programs that allow parents to work while their children learn and classes that help adults gain new skills, contributing to local economies.",
      "In withholding the funds, the Office of Management and Budget had said some of the programs supported a \"radical leftwing agenda. \"",
      "\"We share your concern,\" the GOP senators had written. \"However, we do not believe that is happening with these funds.\"",
      "School superintendents had warned they would have to eliminate academic services without the money. On Friday, AASA, an association of superintendents, thanked members of Congress for pressing to release the money.",
      "In Harford County, Maryland, some of the withheld federal money made up more than half the budget for the district's annual summer camp for kids learning English. The money helps the district hire certified teachers to staff the camp, incorporating learning into children's play for four weeks during the summer. The program helps kids keep their English and academic momentum over the summer.",
      "The district serves roughly 1,100 students who are non-native English speakers. Many of them are born in the U.S. to parents who came to the area seeking job opportunities, often in the restaurants and warehouses that have popped up in the past decades in the region northeast of Baltimore. During the school year, the soon-to-be-released federal money pays for tutors for kids learning English.",
      "On Thursday, more than 350 children filled the second floor of Bel Air High School for the second-to-last day of summer camp. Young learners crowded around an alphabet wheel, jostling with each other to push each letter button as they thought of foods starting with letters from A to Z.",
      "Middle school students watched a robotics team demonstration, and a few sheepishly raised their hands when asked if they would be interested in joining. High school student volunteers, some of whom had been campers learning English themselves not many years ago, helped the youngest children with art projects.",

    "summary": "Automated license plate reader technology is used by law enforcement agencies in communities across the U.S. \u2014 but the systems sometimes get things wrong.",
    "story": [
      "In 2018, Brian Hofer and his younger brother were driving to visit their parents for Thanksgiving. It should have been a routine trip.",
      "But that evening they found themselves held at gunpoint by a group of law enforcement officers.",
      "The incident was the result of technology gone wrong. Hofer's vehicle had been flagged as stolen by an Automated License Plate Reader \u2014 ALPR \u2014 system. When he drove by, the reader alerted authorities.",
      "\"Your life definitely is different after you have guns pointed at you,\" he said.",
      "This incident is one of over a dozen cases verified by CBS News during a six-month investigation into incidents of wrongful stops and even several instances of ALPR technology being abused.",
      "The consequences of ALPR errors can range from the inconvenient \u2014 such as mistaken toll booth charges \u2014 to the potentially dangerous, such as Hofer's armed detainment. In some instances the technology was improperly used by authorities, such as in Kansas, where law enforcement officers used license plate reader systems to stalk former partners in two separate incidents.",
      "The rise of ALPR systems",
      "In use since at least the\u00a0late 1990s, automated license plate reader systems have advanced quickly in recent years. They now marry high-speed, high-resolution cameras with artificial intelligence to scan every license plate passing through a designated field of vision. The data is then compared against license plate numbers in databases.",
      "Thousands of agencies use these systems daily to scan plates in real time and identify potential matches. Departments use ALPRs as a crime-fighting tool to gather evidence for investigations and reduce crime as well as for traffic compliance.",
      "According to a survey from the Bureau of Justice Statistics, every police department overseeing more than 1 million citizens reported using the technology, as did 90% of sheriff's offices with 500 or more sworn deputies.",
      "Law enforcement officials told CBS News that the technology has allowed them to do their job more efficiently and has helped solve crimes ranging from stolen vehicles to missing persons cases.",
      "Pat Yoes, the national president of The National Fraternal Order of Police, an organization of hundreds of thousands of sworn law enforcement officers, said in an emailed statement to CBS News that ALPRs are \"extraordinarily important in cases where there is an immediate threat to life or safety, as in an abduction or an armed threat driving to a target,\" adding that the information can be valuable in generating leads and closing cases.",
      "He said transparency is key. \"The community should be made aware of the new technology, how it's used in the field, how it contributes to public safety, and how it addresses any privacy concerns,\" he said in the statement. \"Technology like ALPRs is a valuable tool for many law enforcement agencies to make their communities safer.\"",
      "The rise of ALPR systems comes as law enforcement agencies across the country face staffing and recruiting challenges. A 2024 survey by the International Association of Chiefs of Police, a professional association, found that U.S. agencies are operating at a nearly 10% staffing deficit. ALPR technology is one way to help fill this gap in manpower.",
      "Why license plate readers make errors \u2014 what we found",
      "License plate reader errors may occur for a variety of reasons. In some cases, letters or numbers are interpreted incorrectly by the Optical Character Recognition, or OCR, software. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, common issues including glare or misaligned cameras could impact accuracy. CBS News found that mistakes are often due to a mix of machine and human or administrative errors.",
      "In Espa\u00f1ola, New Mexico, a 12-year-old was handcuffed after an ALPR camera misread the last number of a license plate on a vehicle driven by her older sister as a \"7\" instead of the \"2\" it actually ended with, according to a lawsuit filed against the city. A month later, in a separate incident, a 17-year-old honors student was held at gunpoint in Espa\u00f1ola on his way home from school after officers mistook his vehicle for one associated with an individual who was being sought in connection with a string of armed robberies.",
      "In Aurora, Colorado, in 2020, a mother and her family, including her 6-year-old daughter, were pulled over at gunpoint and forced to lie face down on hot pavement. Again, ALPR technology was central to the stop. Police mistakenly flagged their Colorado license plate as matching that of a completely different vehicle from a different state \u2014 a stolen motorcycle registered in Montana. The incident, captured on video and widely condemned, led to a $1.9 million settlement from the city in 2024.",
      "Privacy and accuracy concerns",
      "The ACLU warns ALPR cameras could infringe on civil rights and violate the Constitution's Fourth Amendment by encouraging unreasonable searches. Despite widespread use, there is no federal legislative framework for ALPR use.",
      "Hofer, who has been involved in privacy advocacy for over a decade, is now the executive director of Secure Justice, an organization that aims to reduce government and corporate overreach. He says manual verification is necessary to see whether ALPR \"hits,\" or matches, are accurate. Even so, he said, such checks are insufficient because data errors could cause a plate to \"match\" an incorrect entry in a database.",
      "\"There are billions of scans a day in America. If there's even just a 10% error rate, that means there are so many opportunities for abuse to happen,\" Hofer said.",
      "Some concerned citizens are taking action. Last year, residents of Norfolk, Virginia, filed a federal lawsuit against the city, and in Illinois, two residents have sued the Illinois State Police over ALPR systems, arguing that their use violates Fourth Amendment rights. The latter case was dismissed without prejudice in April.",

      "Mr. Trump and his son Eric played with the U.S. ambassador to Britain, Warren Stephens, near Turnberry, a historic course that the Trump family's company took over in 2014. Security was tight, and protesters kept at a distance and unseen by the group during Mr. Trump's round. He was dressed in black, with a white \"USA\" cap, and was spotted driving a golf cart.",
      "The president appeared to play an opening nine holes, stop for lunch, then head out for nine more. By the middle of the afternoon, plainclothes security officials began leaving, suggesting Mr. Trump was done for the day.",
      "Hundreds of demonstrators gathered on the cobblestone and tree-lined street in front of the U.S. Consulate about 100 miles away in Edinburgh, Scotland's capital. Speakers told the crowd that Mr. Trump was not welcome and criticized British Prime Minister Keir Starmer for striking a recent trade deal to avoid stiff U.S. tariffs on goods imported from the U.K.",
      "Protests were planned in other cities as environmental activists, opponents of Israel's war with Hamas in Gaza and pro-Ukraine groups loosely formed a \"Stop Trump Coalition.\" Anita Bhadani, an organizer, said the protests were \"kind of like a carnival of resistance.\"",
      "Mr. Trump's late mother, Mary Anne MacLeod, was born on the Isle of Lewis in Scotland and the president has suggested he feels at home in the country. But the protesters did their best to change that.",
      "\"I don't think I could just stand by and not do anything,\" said Amy White, 15, of Edinburgh, who attended with her parents. She held a cardboard sign that said \"We don't negotiate with fascists.\" She said \"so many people here loathe him. We're not divided. We're not divided by religion, or race or political allegiance, we're just here together because we hate him.\"",
      "Other demonstrators held signs of pictures with Mr. Trump and Jeffrey Epstein as the fervor over files in the case has increasingly frustrated the president.",
      "In the view of Mark Gorman, 63, of Edinburgh, \"the vast majority of Scots have this sort of feeling about Trump that, even though he has Scottish roots, he's a disgrace.\"",
      "Gorman, who works in advertising, said he came out \"because I have deep disdain for Donald Trump and everything that he stands for.\"",
      "Saturday's protests were not nearly as large as the throngs that demonstrated across Scotland when Mr. Trump played at Turnberry during his first term in 2018.",
      "But, as bagpipes played, people chanted \"Trump Out!\" and raised dozens of homemade signs that said things like \"No red carpet for dictators,\" \"We don't want you here\" and \"Stop Trump. Migrants welcome.\"",

      "The talks have been bogged down over conflicting demands on terms to end the 21-month war. Hamas says it will only release all of the hostages still held in Gaza in exchange for a full Israeli withdrawal and an end to the war.",

      "The official said he was \"really surprised\" by the \"out of context statement by the U.S. envoy and the overarching attitude that reflects a preprepared, irresponsible and negative response\" by the U.S.",
      "The official stressed that Hamas was \"still involved in the ceasefire talks\" and expected the mediators and the international community to \"carry their responsibility\" to alleviate the dire circumstances in Gaza.",
      "Earlier Thursday, an Israeli official had told The Associated Press that Hamas' latest response was \"workable.\"",

      "People are starving \"because we're just not getting in,\" Haq said, reiterating that obstacles imposed by Israel were inhibiting the delivery of U.N. aid.",
      "\"If this does not get better soon and more aid goes through all the various checkpoints, people will die,\" he said. \"We've been saying this for months, and now we're at the point where, in fact, people are dying.\"",
      "UNICEF, the U.N.'s Children's Fund, said in a statement on Thursday that 798 Palestinian civilians, including children, were killed near aid distribution sites in Gaza between May 27 and July 7 while seeking food.",
      "More than 100 people have died in Gaza from malnutrition since the war started, UNICEF said, and 80% were children. The charity said screening in the Palestinian enclave had found 6,000 children in a state of acute malnourishment in June alone, marking a 180% increase since February.",

Late Friday, an Emirati official told CBS News that the UAE is considering joining the airdrops over Gaza.",
      "Two Jordanian officials told CBS News that the Jordanian Air Force is involved in central coordination of the potential aid deliveries. Jordan has not yet received official approval from Israel, but as soon as it does, it may proceed.",
      "A United Arab Emirates official also told CBS News that there is a 7,000-ton aid ship en route to Gaza at this time. The official said the ship was already cleared by Israel.",
      "A Saudi Arabian official told CBS News it has sent tons of aid intended for Gaza, but that the aid has been sitting undelivered for weeks. The issue, the official said, is that the Israeli government has rejected nearly all of the food parcels.",
      "Israel says it is allowing enough aid into Gaza and it blames U.N. agencies for failing to distribute it. But those agencies say it's nearly impossible to safely deliver aid because of Israeli restrictions and a breakdown of law and order in Gaza, with crowds of thousands swarming around food trucks as soon as they move into the territory.",
      "UNICEF said that from May 19 to July 2, an average of 30 U.N. aid trucks entered Gaza per day, compared to the average of 500 trucks per day that were entering before the war. The charity said current food supplies in Gaza amounted to about 6% of the normal, pre-war levels.",
      "In greater numbers than ever, children hollowed up by hunger are overwhelming the Patient's Friends Hospital, the main emergency center for malnourished kids in northern Gaza.",
      "Staff at the facility said five young children who died last weekend of malnutrition marked a change: They were the first deaths seen at the center in children who had no preexisting conditions. Symptoms are getting worse, with children too weak to cry or move, said Dr. Rana Soboh, a nutritionist. In past months, most children brought in malnourished improved with treatment, despite supply shortages, but now patients stay longer and don't get better, she said.",
      "The lack of basic health care and sanitation is also enabling deadly diseases to spread in Gaza, the charity OXFAM warned on Friday.",
      "\"Water-borne diseases that are both preventable and readily treatable have increased by almost 150% inside Gaza over the past three months as Israel continues to deliberately block aid,\" the group said. \"Available multi-agency health data shows that the numbers of Palestinians presenting to health facilities with acute watery diarrhea have increased by 150 percent, bloody diarrhea by 302 percent, and acute jaundice cases by 101 percent.\"",
      "OXFAM said the figures were likely \"grossly under-reported because most of the two million people trapped by Israel's continuing siege have little access to the few healthcare facilities that have managed to keep operating.\"",

      "The incident occurred near the Bahamas off San Salvador Island on the Icon of the Seas cruise ship, according to the Royal Bahamas Police Force. Around 7:30 p.m. local time, a 35-year-old South African man allegedly stabbed a 28-year-old South African woman multiple times, police said.",
      "The man fled the scene and jumped into the water. He was later found unresponsive and pronounced dead by onboard medical staff, police said. The woman suffered stab wounds to her upper body and was last reported to be in stable condition, police said.",

    "story": [
      "Balmedie, Scotland\u00a0\u2014 President Trump arrived in Scotland Friday for a four-day private trip \u2014 his first to the U.K. since he was reelected. The White House says he'll meet with Prime Minister Keir Starmer during his visit to discuss trade, but he'll also be opening a brand-new course at the Trump International Golf Links.",
      "Set on Scotland's rugged northeast coast, it's a stunningly beautiful location, and it's easy to see why Mr. Trump was keen to purchase the site more than a decade ago and develop it into a world-class golf club.",
      "But as CBS News learned from speaking with locals, many struggle to separate the American president's politics from his putting green.",
      "David Milne bought his old Coast Guard look-out on the Aberdeenshire coast over 20 years ago, and he still lives there today. But since 2012, it's been right in the middle of Trump territory, surrounded by hundreds of acres of shifting sand dunes that have been meticulously sculpted into 36 holes that anyone can play a round on \u2014 for about $500.",
      "Milne isn't happy about his new neighbor.",
      "\"It's always second-best to what was there originally,\" he told CBS News. \"When I came in here, this landscape was untouched \u2026 now it's just a golf course.\"",
      "Mr. Trump first purchased the land in 2006, and during development he offered to buy some of the neighbors' places, too, but Milne refused to sell.",
      "In 2011, Mr. Trump said he didn't like the look of Milne's property anyway.",
      "\"Who cares,\" the future president told the Golf Channel, pointing to Milne's home. \"We're trying to build the greatest course in the world. The house is ugly.\"",
      "Asked what the land means to himself and his family, Milne said it was much more than just a patch of picturesque coastline.",
      "\"Land is what Scotland is. Not just financially, it's in the soul of the Scottish people as well. It is where we come from, and where we go back to,\" he said.",
      "The visit to Scotland is a homecoming for Mr. Trump, too. His mother, born Mary Anne MacLeod in 1912, grew up on a the Scottish Hebridean island of Lewis. He named one of his courses in Aberdeenshire after her.",
      "Mr. Trump has been met with protests on previous visits, and vandalism at his golf courses has taken a political tone in recent months.",
      "Tommy Campbell, a veteran labor union activist in Scotland, told CBS News he was planning to lead another protest during the U.S. leader's visit this weekend, with a clear message for Mr. Trump:",
      "\"You are not welcome here,\" he said. \"The policies that he represents are completely at odds with what we value here.\"",
      "A poll conducted in February found around 70% of Scots have an unfavorable opinion of President Trump. In the village near his golf links, CBS News spoke with the members of a walking club, who hold a grudge.",
      "\"The way he treated the neighbors and property owners, I think that influenced us all badly,\" said one woman.",
      "But the course employs more than 80 people, and the White House says it has had a positive economic impact in the area.",
      "One local man \u2014 a golfer \u2014 told CBS News the business Mr. Trump has done, \"from a golf perspective, is fantastic.\"",
      "\"Not saying the protests are not right,\" he added. \"Some of the stuff, I'd agree with the protesters, but I think there's a time and a place for it, and it's not on the golf course.\"",
      "Opinions about President Trump are a bit like the weather in Aberdeenshire. But fair or foul \u2014 in true Scottish fashion \u2014 they're unlikely to stop a good round of golf.",

      "The visit is Mr. Trump's first visit to the U.K. of his second term, although he also visited during his first term.",
      "It's unusual for a modern-day president to promote his personal business on a taxpayer-funded trip \u2014 or while in office at all. Mr. Trump has said his children are managing his companies while he's president. Some of the costs for this trip, like operating Air Force One at roughly $192,000 an hour and providing Secret Service security and lodging for staff, are being covered by taxpayers.",

      "Before leaving for Scotland Friday, Mr. Trump said there's a \"50/50 chance, maybe less than that\" that his administration would reach a trade deal with the EU. Without a deal, Mr. Trump has threatened to hit imports from the EU's 27 member countries with a whopping 30% tariff rate. The president has long been critical of the U.S.-EU trade relationship, claiming the U.S. has been treated unfairly.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/canada-junior-hockey-trial-verdict-sexual-assault-case/",
    "published": "Thu, 24 Jul 2025 16:14:22 -0400",
    "summary": "When the former Canadian junior hockey players were charged in early 2024\u200b, four of them played in the NHL.",
    "story": [
      "An Ontario judge acquitted five former members of Canada's world junior hockey team on Thursday in their sexual assault case, saying the complainant's allegations lacked the credibility needed to justify the charges.",
      "Superior Court Justice Maria Carroccia said prosecutors could not meet the onus of proof for the charges against Michael McLeod, Carter Hart, Alex Formenton, Dillon Dube and Callan Foote.",
      "The players' identities were made public when they were charged in early 2024. At the time, four of them played in the NHL \u2014 Dube for the Calgary Flames, Hart for the Philadelphia Flyers, and McLeod and Foote for the New Jersey Devils. Formenton had previously played for the Ottawa Senators before joining a Swiss team. All went on indefinite leave and none is on an NHL roster or has an active contract with a team in the league.",
      "All five players had pleaded not guilty to sexual assault in an encounter that took place in a London, Ontario, hotel room in the early hours of June 19, 2018. Years of speculation regarding the allegations \u2014 fueled by a lawsuit settlement, parliamentary hearings and revived investigations by the police and Hockey Canada, along with an NHL investigation \u2014 all preceded a complex trial earlier this year that included a mistrial and the dismissal of the jury, leaving the verdict to Carroccia.",
      "Carroccia explained her reasoning for the acquittals in detail over the course of five hours, highlighting the complainant's \"tendency to blame others\" for inconsistencies in her allegations. She also said the woman went to \"great lengths\" to point out that she was really drunk through the course of the night, but that is not supported by surveillance video from a bar and hotel that night and the testimony of others.",
      "McLeod was also acquitted \u2014 and pleaded not guilty \u2014 to a separate count of being a party to the offense, an unusual application of a charge that is more typically seen in murder cases.",
      "The players, who are now between the ages of 25 and 27, were in London at the time for a gala and golf tournament marking their championship victory.",
      "The woman testified in May that she was naked, drunk and scared when four of the men showed up unexpectedly in her room at the Delta Hotel London Armouries and felt the only \"safe\" option was to do what they wanted. Prosecutors argued the players did what they wanted without taking steps to ensure she was voluntarily consenting to sexual acts.",
      "\"I made the choice to dance with them and drink at the bar, I did not make the choice to have them do what they did back at the hotel,\" she testified.",
      "Defense attorneys cross-examined her for days and suggested she actively participated in or initiated sexual activity because she wanted a \"wild night.\" Two short videos of the complainant taken by McLeod the night of the encounter were played in court. In one, the woman says it was \"all consensual,\" though she told the court that wasn't how she truly felt.",
      "Protesters gathered outside a packed London courthouse on Thursday morning, holding signs that signaled support for the complainant.",
      "The Associated Press and other news organizations do not identify sexual assault accusers unless they have granted permission to do so, which she has not.",
      "The public didn't learn of the allegations for years. Police closed their initial investigation without charges in early 2019, but the complainant sued Hockey Canada in 2022. The organization settled the lawsuit amid intense scrutiny that cost it sponsors, but police reopened their investigation.",
      "The NHL launched its own investigation in 2022. Officials pledged to release the findings, though Commissioner Gary Bettman said in February that would depend on what the league can say given the legal proceedings.",

    "story": [
      "London \u2014\u00a0President Trump is due to arrive Friday for what the White House is calling a \"working visit\" to Scotland. It's expected to include a mix of both personal time and political business. As was the case during his last visit as president in 2018, he is likely to be greeted by protests everywhere he goes in his mother's native land.",
      "The plan is for Mr. Trump to pay visits to his two luxury golf resorts in Scotland, Trump International on the east coast of Aberdeenshire, which he bought in 2012, and Trump Turnberry in Ayrshire, about 200 miles away on the west coast, which he purchased in 2014.",
      "During his visit, he's also set to meet Scotland's top official, First Minister John Swinney, who publicly backed Kamala Harris' presidential bid against Mr. Trump last year.",
      "The American leader will also meet British Prime Minister Keir Starmer near the end of his trip in Scotland, and the current 25% U.S. tariffs on British steel imports could be a focus of discussion.",
      "Trump visits bring protests and security concerns",
      "Mr. Trump has Scottish roots through his mother, who was born in 1912 as Mary Anne MacLeod on the Scottish island of Lewis in the remote Outer Hebrides.",
      "But despite his ancestry, Mr. Trump can likely expect a lukewarm to cold reception on Scottish soil. Some Scots believe the American real estate mogul-turned-president has been good for the country, bringing in investment and with it, some employment, but others criticize the policies he has adopted during his second term.",
      "In advance of Mr. Trump's arrival, the Stop Trump Scotland protest group has been organizing demonstrations at Aberdeen and outside the U.S. consulate in Scotland's capital, Edinburgh \u2014 part of a so-called \"Festival of Resistance\" that aims to mix city-based actions with countryside activism around Mr. Trump's golf resorts.",
      "The demonstrations are slated to include large banners and messages in the sand of Scotland's coastline, intended to be visible to the president as he lands",
      "A senior Scottish police official told Britain's Sky News it would be \"inappropriate\" to ignore the assassination attempt against Mr. Trump a year ago.",
      "\"There's a broad range of considerations,\" said Police Scotland Assistant Chief Constable Emma Bond. \"It would be inappropriate for me to plan an operation and not bear in mind what has happened in other parts of the world. But with that in mind, we've got a really experienced team of officers working as part of planning the operation.\"",
      "During Mr. Trump's 2018 trip to Scotland, CBS News' partner network BBC News says there were more than 5,000 police officers deployed, with the U.K. Treasury chipping in about \u00a35 million ($6.8 million) to help cover the costs to the Scottish police force.",
      "Trump's visit is private, but with some politics",
      "While he made his preference for Mr. Trump's opponent clear before the last U.S. election, the head of Scotland's government said it was his duty to meet with the U.S. president during his upcoming visit.",
      "\"I've taken a decision that's in Scotland's interest to meet with the president of the United States so that I can use every opportunity to protect and to promote the interests of the people of Scotland,\" Swinney told Britain's PA news agency. \"There's obviously a range of issues that we can cover around the international situation that's causing such anxiety to people in Scotland, around the situation the Middle East, and the situation in Ukraine, and the domestic issues that are important to us around about the implications of, for example, trade and tariffs on some of our key sectors, including Scotch whisky.\"",
      "Mr. Trump is expected to meet on Monday with Prime Minister Starmer, but due to it being officially a private visit, neither the White House nor Starmer's office have revealed much about what the two may do or discuss. For Starmer, however, keeping discussions going about U.S. tariffs imposed since Mr. Trump came back to the White House will likely be a key theme.",
      "President Trump has imposed 25% tariffs on imported British steel. Starmer hopes to get that rate lowered, to zero if possible, to shore up the U.K.'s steel industry, which has seen its output plummet by around 80% since the 1960's.",
      "White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said Wednesday that the two leaders would meet \"to refine the historic U.S.-U.K. trade deal\" brokered in May.",
      "Mr. Trump will return to the U.K. for an unprecedented second official state visit on September 17, during which he is scheduled to meet with King Charles III. Starmer hand-delivered the invitation for that visit, on behalf of the monarch, when he visited Mr. Trump at the White House in February.",

The case marked the first instance of the Supreme Court limiting a president's removal power by ruling that Roosevelt overstepped his authority. The court found that presidents could not dismiss FTC commissioners without a reason, such as malfeasance, before their seven-year terms ended, as outlined by Congress in the FTC Act.",

It manages a vast and complex network of power distribution. This summer, the grid is showing signs of strain.",
      "In just the past year, data centers running AI have started using much more electricity. These centers can consume up to 30 times more power than traditional data centers.

      "3. Report phishing emails: Use Outlook\u2019s built-in tools to report suspicious messages as phishing. You can also forward them to Microsoft at reportphishing@microsoft.com.",
      "4. Use strong antivirus software: Consider using strong antivirus software with built-in phishing and link protection to catch threats before they reach you. Stay vigilant when it comes to emails, phone calls, or messages from unknown sources asking for personal information. Avoid clicking on suspicious links or providing sensitive details unless you can verify the legitimacy of the request. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",

      "5. Never share sensitive info: Microsoft will never ask for your password, 2FA code, or payment details via email. If you\u2019re unsure, log in directly from a browser to check.",
      "6. Consider personal data removal services: After phishing attempts, your data may end up circulating among data brokers, increasing your risk of future scams and identity theft. Data removal services can help reduce the visibility of your personal information by submitting removal requests to dozens of people-search and broker sites. This limits how easily scammers and spammers can find and target you.",

      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Fake Microsoft alerts are carefully crafted to appear genuine, which is why it\u2019s crucial to remain cautious. Always verify messages through official channels, avoid clicking suspicious links, and report anything that doesn\u2019t seem right. A few extra seconds of caution can help protect your account and your personal data.",

      "DreamDrive Pro combines advanced hardware and intelligent software to power Lucid's driver-assistance system. It uses 32 integrated sensors, including LiDAR, radar, visible-light and surround-view cameras and ultrasonic sensors. This setup delivers precise environmental awareness for everything from highway cruising to close-range maneuvers.",

      "These updates are just the beginning. Lucid is investing heavily in advanced driver-assistance and automation, with a clear focus on safety, comfort and long-term innovation.",
      "Lucid now joins the ranks of top hands-free driving systems. Tesla's Full Self-Driving and GM's Super Cruise both offer hands-free driving on highways, though they differ in how they monitor driver attention and what roads they support. Ford's BlueCruise is another major option, available on a growing number of mapped highways. Mercedes-Benz Drive Pilot goes a step further by letting drivers take their eyes off the road in certain traffic conditions, though it's only available in limited markets for now.",

      "What this means for you",
      "If you're driving a car with advanced driver-assistance features, such as the Lucid Air or similar models, you're likely noticing real changes in your daily routine. With hands-off driving now available on select highways, those stressful commutes can feel a little easier. Sitting in stop-and-go traffic doesn't have to be such a chore anymore. Long road trips? Suddenly, they're much more comfortable. Many automakers, not just Lucid, are pushing out updates directly to your car, so you can access new tools without ever stepping into a service center.",
      "Safety is at the forefront with these new systems. As you drive, a network of sensors and smart software helps keep your lane changes smooth, your following distances steady and your ride free from abrupt surprises. These advances can give you peace of mind, but it's essential to remember that these systems don't drive for you. You still need to stay alert and keep your hands ready.",
      "With more cars using similar technology each year, the roads themselves are changing. There's hope that fewer accidents caused by distraction or delayed reactions will benefit not just tech-savvy drivers, but everyone out there. While these models, like the Lucid Air, showcase what's possible, the real transformation comes as driver-assistance features become the new normal in cars everywhere.",

      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "Lucid's new hands-free driving update puts it in direct competition with Tesla, GM, and other automakers working to change the way we drive. With DreamDrive Pro, Lucid shows that combining advanced hardware, in-house software, and frequent updates can deliver real capability. As more companies roll out similar systems, drivers are getting more options, and the convenience once reserved for luxury models is becoming more accessible.",

      "Choosing the right VPN",
      "Not every VPN offers the same level of security or privacy. Free VPNs might log your activity or sell your data. For true privacy, look for a VPN that does not keep logs, uses strong encryption, and offers high-speed servers. The VPN should support multiple devices under one account, and ideally, the company should be based in a country with strong privacy laws.",

      "Your home Wi-Fi may seem secure, but appearances can be deceiving. Weak router settings, tracking by ISPs and smart devices with poor security all put your personal information at risk. Antivirus software and firewalls cannot fix all of these problems. A VPN offers a powerful layer of protection by encrypting your traffic, hiding your activity, and making your connection truly private. But remember, true digital security comes from layers, VPNs, antivirus, strong passwords, updated firmware and secure DNS, all play a role.",

      "You might think heart disease comes with warning signs. But some of the deadliest types, like structural heart disease (SHD), creep in silently. No chest pain. No shortness of breath. Nothing until it's too late.",
      "Now, a new artificial intelligence tool called EchoNext is changing the game. It can flag hidden heart problems that even trained cardiologists miss just by analyzing a standard ECG. That's right. A routine, five-minute heart test you've probably already had could now unlock life-saving information if AI is watching.",

      "A stethoscope and an electrocardiogram image\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What is structural heart disease, and why is it so dangerous?",
      "SHD refers to defects in the heart's walls, valves or chambers. Some are present at birth. Others develop slowly over time. Either way, they often go unnoticed until something major happens, like a heart attack or stroke. That's why experts sometimes call SHD the \"hidden\" heart disease. Here's the problem. Even the ECGs doctors routinely use to spot heart issues often can't detect SHD on their own. And that's where EchoNext comes in.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "EchoNext: The AI that knows when to dig deeper",
      "EchoNext was created by researchers at Columbia University and NewYork-Presbyterian. The tool was trained on over 1.2 million ECG and echocardiogram pairs from more than 230,000 patients. Its job? Figure out when a patient's ECG suggests a deeper look is needed, specifically, an echocardiogram, the ultrasound that gives a detailed view of heart structure.",

      "EchoNext outperformed human cardiologists",
      "In tests, EchoNext correctly flagged 77% of structural heart disease cases from ECGs. Cardiologists? Just 64%. Even more impressive, when tested on nearly 85,000 people, EchoNext identified over 7,500 at high risk for undiagnosed SHD. A year later, researchers found that 73% of those who followed up with echocardiograms were indeed diagnosed with SHD, a rate far above average. These groundbreaking results were published in Nature, one of the world's most respected scientific journals. That's not just a better test. That's a potential lifesaver.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "Why this matters now more than ever",
      "Millions walk around every day with SHD and have no idea. They skip heart screenings because nothing feels wrong. Even when they do get an ECG, subtle warning signs can slip by unnoticed. EchoNext doesn't miss them. And it doesn't get tired or distracted. This isn't about replacing doctors. Iit's about giving them a powerful new tool to catch what humans alone can't.",
      "A stethoscope and mask with red foiled chocolate hearts and a person holding a heart\u00a0\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What this means for you",
      "You don't need to wait for symptoms to take your heart health seriously. If you've ever had an ECG, or you're getting one soon, AI could now help spot hidden risks your doctor might miss. Tools like EchoNext make it easier to catch heart problems early, even if you feel fine.",
      "This means fewer surprises, fewer missed diagnoses and a better shot at treatment before it's too late. It's not about replacing doctors. It's about giving them, and you, a better shot at catching problems early. Ask your doctor if AI tools are being used to review your heart tests. You deserve every advantage.

      "The 126 MW Omkareshwar Floating Solar Park spans 642 acres, boosting green power. Kurt Knutsson reports on this innovative solution to global energy challenges.",
      "The world's first hybrid solar cargo ship has just launched in Germany, marking a major milestone for sustainable shipping. The Blue Marlin uses advanced solar technology not only to power its onboard systems but also to drive its main propulsion, setting a new standard for eco-friendly cargo transport. By combining solar panels with a diesel-electric system, this vessel is paving the way for cleaner, more efficient movement of goods along Germany's waterways.",

      "The Blue Marlin is the world's first hybrid solar cargo ship. (Wattlab)",
      "How solar power moves the Blue Marlin",
      "The Blue Marlin uses 192 solar panels, which can generate up to 35 kilowatts in ideal conditions. That\u2019s enough to charge over 1,400 smartphones at the same time. Wattlab designed the solar system to supply electricity directly to the ship\u2019s propulsion system. Unlike earlier vessels, the Blue Marlin uses solar energy for movement, not just for basic onboard functions. When conditions allow, the ship can run on solar power alone for short trips. For example, it can do this when traveling downstream with a light load.",
      "Hybrid technology for reliable shipping",
      "The Blue Marlin also relies on four diesel generators. This hybrid setup lets the vessel switch between solar and diesel-electric power as needed. As a result, the ship stays reliable in any weather. An automated energy management system controls how power is distributed. This system sends energy exactly where it is needed. It also reduces unnecessary fuel use, which helps the environment. In addition, the ship uses a technique called peak shaving. During high energy demand, it draws on solar and battery reserves instead of starting extra generators. This strategy lowers emissions and keeps the operation smooth.",
      "The Blue Marlin is the world's first hybrid solar cargo ship. (Wattlab)",
      "The Blue Martin is well suited for Germany\u2019s waterways",
      "The Blue Marlin measures approximately 282 feet in length and 31 feet in width, with a shallow draft of just 3 feet 7 inches, making it well suited for Germany's canal network. Its hull was constructed in Romania and later outfitted with systems in the Netherlands. Today, the fully completed vessel operates out of Cologne, Germany. SEAFAR remote navigation technology is another feature; this system allows remote-controlled operation on select routes, improving safety and reducing the workload for the crew.",
      "The Blue Marlin\u2019s environmental impact and design benefits",
      "Each year, the Blue Marlin's solar array can generate up to 37,500 kilowatt-hours of electricity. This output helps prevent about 79,000 pounds of CO\u2082 emissions annually. Thanks to its modular design, the ship can connect with push barges and carry up to 3,430 short tons of bulk goods efficiently. Its hybrid diesel-electric system is also designed to run on cleaner fuels in the future, making it adaptable as greener energy options become more available.",
      "The Blue Marlin is the world's first hybrid solar cargo ship. (Wattlab)",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "The Blue Marlin is more than a technological showcase. By fully integrating solar power with intelligent hybrid systems, it proves that performance and environmental responsibility can work together. This vessel stands as a practical example of cleaner shipping solutions. It offers lessons and inspiration for the future of cargo transport around the world.",

      "Windows 11 has had poor adoption, with many people sticking to the good old Windows 10. Microsoft has been pushing users to upgrade, threatening to end software support and warning about potential cybersecurity risks. But Windows 11 isn\u2019t exactly the best OS to come out of Redmond. Even if it were, many people simply can\u2019t upgrade because of its steep system requirements.",
      "In fact, it took Windows 11 nearly four years after its 2021 debut to finally surpass its predecessor in user numbers. Now that Windows 10 is being phased out, many users, especially those with older PCs that don't meet the hardware requirements, are understandably concerned. Tony from Wisconsin recently asked us the same thing:",
      "\"I heard that Microsoft will stop providing security patches for Windows 10 after October. My laptop can't be upgraded to Windows 11 because the CPU is too old. Since I'm not tech-savvy and don't feel comfortable replacing the CPU (nor do I want to), I'm wondering if I have a good antivirus program, do I still need to upgrade? Or will my system still be vulnerable to hackers and viruses?\"",
      "I understand your concern, Tony. Sticking with an unsupported OS brings security risks. Security researchers warn that unsupported systems, such as Windows 10, will become increasingly attractive targets for hackers. Hackers often reverse-engineer patches released for newer systems like Windows 11 to find similar flaws in older ones like Windows 10. With no more fixes coming, those vulnerabilities remain wide open, making unsupported systems a tempting target.",

      "Windows 11 finally surpasses Windows 10 in market share: Here's why it took so long",
      "According to Statcounter, Windows 11 has finally overtaken Windows 10 in terms of desktop and laptop usage as of early July. The newer OS now accounts for 52 percent of all Windows installations, up sharply from just under 48 percent in June. In the same period, Windows 10 dropped from 53.2 percent to 44.6 percent. Interestingly, Windows 7 still holds a small but notable presence, with 2.35 percent of users refusing to let it go.",
      "This shift comes nearly four years after Microsoft announced Windows 11 in June 2021. From the start, it was criticized for strict hardware rules. It required a TPM 2.0 chip and newer processors. Many functional PCs were left unable to upgrade.\u00a0 The operating system also introduced a revamped user interface that some users found unnecessary or confusing, leading to a slow adoption rate.",
      "A man typing on a Windows laptop. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What happens when Windows 10 support ends in 2025? Here's what you need to know",
      "Windows 10 is reaching the end of its official support on October 14, 2025. That means Microsoft will stop releasing new features and routine security updates for the general public. For most users, this marks the end of the road, unless they take specific steps to keep receiving updates.",
      "To extend security updates beyond this deadline, Microsoft is offering a program called Extended Security Updates (ESU). Normally, this would cost $30 per year for personal users. However, Microsoft is making the first year free if you back up your PC using the Windows Backup app and sync your settings to OneDrive, or if you redeem 1,000 Microsoft Rewards points.",
      "Microsoft hasn't disclosed pricing beyond the first year, so it's unclear whether the $30/year rate will remain the same in 2026 and 2027.",
      "If you don't opt into either of those methods, you'll need to pay the $30 to continue receiving critical patches through October 2026. This is especially relevant for those who can't upgrade to Windows 11 due to hardware limitations.",
      "Even after general support ends, Microsoft will keep updating Microsoft Defender Antivirus on Windows 10 until October 2028. So while full system security updates will stop for most, basic malware protection will continue for a few more years.",
      "Windows laptop. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Can't upgrade to Windows 11? 8 Safe alternatives for Windows 10 users in 2025",
      "You can continue using Windows 10 until October 14, 2025, with full access to regular security and stability updates. After that, you can extend protection by enrolling in Microsoft's Extended Security Updates program. The first year is free if you use the Windows Backup app to sync your settings to OneDrive, or if you redeem 1,000 Microsoft Rewards points.",
      "If your computer meets the hardware requirements for Windows 11, upgrading is the easiest long-term solution. You\u2019ll get access to ongoing feature updates, improved security, and long-term support through at least 2031.",
      "Google offers a free operating system called ChromeOS Flex, designed for older PCs and laptops. It\u2019s based on the same system used in Chromebooks and focuses on speed, simplicity, and security. However, it doesn\u2019t support Android apps or some hardware features like fingerprint readers and may not work for tasks like video editing or gaming.. This can be a great option if you mostly use web apps like Gmail, Google Docs, or Zoom.",
      "Linux distributions like Ubuntu, Linux Mint, or Zorin OS provide a stable and user-friendly experience, especially for those coming from Windows. You can use them on older hardware without any licensing fees, and they come with access to thousands of free applications. While there may be a bit of a learning curve, many users find Linux reliable and surprisingly easy to adapt to for everyday tasks like browsing, writing, and media playback.",
      "If your current system can\u2019t handle Windows 11 and you are not interested in alternatives like ChromeOS or Linux, investing in a new computer may be the most straightforward path. New devices come with Windows 11 pre-installed and are built to support it fully. This ensures you\u2019ll continue to receive updates, features, and support for several years without additional effort.",

      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "The end of Windows 10 support isn\u2019t a crisis, but it does require action. You should start planning your next move now. Consider upgrading to a newer version of Windows. You could also switch to a different operating system. Another option is investing in stronger security tools. And be on alert: as Windows 10\u2019s end-of-life nears, scammers will take advantage. Watch out for phone calls, emails, or pop-ups pretending to be from Microsoft offering \"urgent upgrade help.\" Microsoft doesn\u2019t call users out of the blue\u2014these are scams trying to steal your personal info or install malware.

      "Single-side electrode configuration setup using hydration bioimpedance sensor. (University of Texas at Austin)",
      "How the wearable hydration sensor works",
      "Developed by researchers at the University of Texas at Austin, the sensor is designed to detect early signs of dehydration using a method called bioimpedance. This method sends a small, painless electrical current through your bicep and measures how easily that current flows through your tissue. Because water is a good conductor of electricity, well-hydrated tissue lets the current pass easily. When you're dehydrated, your tissues resist the current, and the sensor detects that. The sensor connects wirelessly to a smartphone app, delivering instant feedback about your hydration level. You don't have to stop what you're doing or wait for lab results. The data is continuous and always available.",
      "Wearable hydration sensor benefits for workouts, jobs, and health",
      "This isn't just cool tech, it's practical. For athletes pushing through workouts in the heat, the sensor could help them avoid fatigue or cramping. For firefighters or police officers wearing heavy gear in scorching temperatures, it offers a way to stay safe on the job. Even office workers who forget to drink water during long meetings could benefit from a reminder when their hydration levels drop. The researchers believe the wearable hydration sensor could also play a major role in health care. Patients with kidney problems or cardiovascular issues often need to monitor hydration closely. Until now, that meant invasive tests or relying on symptoms. This sensor could make hydration tracking simple, accurate, and non-invasive.",
      "The science behind the hydration sensor",
      "To make sure the sensor really works, the research team ran controlled experiments. They had participants take a diuretic to promote fluid loss and tracked hydration using the sensor. At the same time, they collected urine samples to confirm results. The sensor's data closely matched the chemical markers in the samples. That means the technology is not only accurate, but it can also be trusted even during normal daily activities like walking or working. Study co-author Matija Jankovic explained that arm bioimpedance was highly sensitive to changes in hydration. It also aligned with whole-body hydration, making it a reliable alternative to traditional testing.",
      "Rigid PCB and commercial gel electrode system. (University of Texas at Austin)",
      "Traditional hydration tests fall short",
      "Standard ways of checking hydration, like urine tests or blood work, are time-consuming and not practical for everyday use. Some commercial tools already exist, but they tend to be bulky or require users to stay in one spot. They're just not built for real life. That's where this sensor has the edge. It's compact, portable, and constantly running in the background. It works while you move, exercise, or even just sit at your desk.",
      "What's next for hydration tracking",
      "Right now, the sensor tracks relative changes in hydration, which is a powerful tool on its own. But the research team wants to take it further. They plan to collect data from a larger population to create baseline values for absolute hydration levels. This step would make the device even more accurate and personal. They're also exploring new wearable designs, such as breathable e-tattoos and sweat-wicking sensors, that could offer better comfort and longer wear. Future models might track hydration in other areas of the body, like the forearm or thigh. The team is optimistic that these innovations will make hydration tracking even more seamless and accessible. Lead researcher Nanshu Lu, who has worked on similar wearable health tech in the past, says this is only the beginning. Her vision is to bring simple, real-time hydration tracking to everyone, no matter their lifestyle or profession.",
      "A woman sweating during a workout. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What this means for you",
      "Staying hydrated just got a whole lot easier. With a wearable hydration sensor, you no longer have to rely on guesswork or vague reminders to drink water. Whether you're powering through a workout, focused on a demanding job, or just caught up in a busy day, this device keeps tabs on your hydration status in real time. That means you get clear, instant feedback-before dehydration slows you down.",
      "While this technology is still in the research and development phase, the early results are promising. It's not yet available to the public, but the groundwork is in place. Once it moves into production, this kind of real-time hydration tracking could become a part of daily life, helping you stay healthier, more alert, and ahead of the curve.",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Dehydration isn't always obvious, but it can quickly become serious. The wearable hydration sensor puts the power to monitor your health back in your hands. It's accurate, non-invasive, and built for daily life. Whether you're training for a marathon or just trying to stay sharp at work, knowing your hydration status in real time could make all the difference.",

      "Ever wondered why spilled coffee, wine or tea dries in a ring rather than evenly? This common pattern is known as the \"coffee ring effect.\" The phenomenon occurs because of the liquid's surface tension. As the drop begins to dry, water at the edges evaporates more quickly since that area is thinner. To keep up, liquid from the center flows outward, carrying tiny particles with it. Once the drop is completely dry, these particles settle along the edge, creating the signature ring stain you see on tables and countertops every day.",

This innovative test can identify diseases like COVID-19, prostate cancer and sepsis with remarkable accuracy. In fact, it is up to 100 times more sensitive than many current rapid tests. Even better, it delivers results in just twelve minutes, depending on the test.",
      "The idea began with Kamyar Behrouzi, a former Ph.D. student at UC Berkeley. While developing a COVID-19 biosensor in 2020, he noticed that virus particles, much like coffee particles, tend to gather at the edge of a droplet. By using this natural effect, the researchers designed a test that captures and concentrates disease markers, making detection much easier. Thanks to this stain-inspired science, fast and reliable testing is now possible right at home.",

      "How this coffee-inspired test detects COVID-19, sepsis, and more",
      "So, how does this innovative test actually work? First, you place a small sample from your nose or cheek onto a special membrane. As the sample dries, disease proteins concentrate at the edges to form a visible ring. Next, you add a second droplet containing light-reactive particles. If certain disease biomarkers are present, these nanoparticles light up when exposed to light. You can see positive results with the naked eye in some cases, or verify them more accurately using a special AI-powered smartphone app.",
      "This rapid test does more than detect COVID-19. It can also identify early signs of sepsis, a life-threatening infection that needs quick treatment.

      "How the e-OPRA bionic knee for amputees works",
      "The tech is called e-OPRA (Enhanced Osseointegrated Prostheses for the Rehabilitation of Amputees). It involves surgically implanting a titanium rod into the femur, which connects directly to a robotic prosthetic limb. This rod becomes the foundation of a new kind of interface between the body and machine. But it doesn't stop there.",
      "Using a specialized surgical technique known as Agonist-Antagonist Myoneural Interface (AMI), muscles are reconnected in functional pairs. These muscles \"talk\" to each other, sending signals to the robotic controller, which calculates exactly how the knee should move, mirroring how a real leg works.",
      "Natural movement restored with the bionic knee for amputees",

      "Why the bionic knee for amputees is a major breakthrough",
      "Traditional socket-based prosthetics can be uncomfortable, unstable, and prone to infections. They often feel foreign, like a tool strapped to the body rather than a part of it. The bionic knee bypasses the socket altogether. By connecting directly to bone and muscle, it improves load-bearing, reduces skin problems, and most importantly, restores a sense of control. And control isn't just physical, it's emotional and psychological. Patients using the e-OPRA system reported a greater sense of agency and body ownership than those with traditional or partially-integrated prosthetics.",

      "Professor Hugh Herr isn't just leading the research; he's living it. After losing both legs below the knee to frostbite in his teens, he returned to mountain climbing and dedicated his career to advancing prosthetic technology. His personal journey powers a lab at MIT that continues to push the boundaries of biomechatronics. And now, that journey may change the lives of above-the-knee amputees worldwide.",

      "Photo showing fentanyl pills seized at the U.S. border. (Elizabeth Denis/Pacific Northwest National Laboratory)",
      "How VaporID detects drugs faster than swab tests",
      "This portable air scanner, created at the Department of Energy's Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL), is being brought to market by California-based instrument maker BaySpec. The device works by pulling in air and identifying molecules in real time using a miniature mass spectrometer.",
      "Unlike traditional swab tests that take five to thirty minutes, VaporID detects fentanyl in seconds, even at levels as low as six parts per trillion. That's like spotting a single pine needle in an entire forest.",
      "Why drug dogs may soon be outmatched by VaporID",
      "For decades, trained canines have been the gold standard at ports of entry. But dogs have limits; they tire, need handlers, and can't be reprogrammed with software updates. VaporID, on the other hand, never needs a nap. It can detect not only known drugs but also fentanyl analogs, lab-made variants designed to skirt detection.",
      "The system's cutting-edge design includes an atmospheric flow tube that allows tiny drug molecules more time to interact with charged ions. That chemical dance dramatically boosts sensitivity, making it possible to detect even the most elusive threats.",
      "During a real-world field trial at the Nogales, Arizona border crossing, the device detected trace amounts of several drugs, including fentanyl and cocaine, within seconds inside a Customs and Border Protection lab.",
      "Illustration of the action within the atmospheric flow tube that is a key to the detection of trace levels of fentanyl. (Sara Levine/Pacific Northwest National Laboratory)",
      "How VaporID works: Air, ions, and instant answers",
      "VaporID weighs about 40 pounds and draws in ambient air like a miniature vacuum. Suspicious molecules are filtered, tagged with electrically charged ions, and passed into a tiny mass spectrometer. Only the relevant particles make it through. This process filters out background interfering vapors from things like perfumes or cleaning agents, giving border agents a clear, accurate, and immediate read on potentially dangerous substances.",
      "What VaporID means for border security",
      "If deployed widely, VaporID could revolutionize how U.S. Customs and Border Protection detects narcotics and explosives. Its fast, hands-free scanning would help agents screen vehicles, cargo, luggage, and even people, without relying solely on canine units or invasive sampling.",
      "The device's sensitivity also opens doors for use beyond borders. The Department of Homeland Security is already working with PNNL and BaySpec to adapt the technology for mail screening, airport baggage checks, and large-scale cargo inspections.",
      "For materials like TNT (trinitrotoluene) and PETN (pentaerythritol tetranitrate), both powerful explosives that release very few molecules into the air, VaporID's ultra-sensitive detection provides a level of protection that's long been out of reach with current methods.",
      "Chemist Elizabeth Denis uses the PNNL system to check a substance in the laboratory. (Andrea Starr/Pacific Northwest National Laboratory)",
      "VaporID\u2019s role in combating drug and explosive smuggling",
      "The U.S. is facing a deadly influx of synthetic opioids. According to the CDC, over 80,000 Americans died from drug overdoses in 2024, including approximately 48,400 deaths linked to fentanyl and other synthetic opioids. Fast, contactless detection at ports of entry could help choke off the supply chain before these deadly substances ever hit the streets. And in an era of rising geopolitical tensions, having a portable scanner that can also detect explosives could be a critical layer in national defense.",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Technology doesn\u2019t just assist border agents anymore; it\u2019s starting to outperform their most trusted tools. VaporID brings speed, precision, and reliability to a job where seconds count. While drug-sniffing dogs have served well, this portable air scanner may soon lead the front line in detecting threats. As agencies prepare to roll out the system, one thing is clear. The future of border security doesn\u2019t bark. It beeps.",

Kinisi intentionally avoided complex legged systems to simplify setup and improve stability. KR1 can operate for up to eight hours on a single charge. It features hot-swappable batteries and an auto-docking system that allows for fast recharging with minimal human intervention. These features make it ideal for continuous use in busy fulfillment centers where downtime costs money.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "AI-powered warehouse robot learns tasks on the fly",
      "KR1 doesn't just move intelligently, it learns. Kinisi equipped the robot with built-in AI that allows it to adapt in real time to its surroundings. It recognizes obstacles, modifies its arm movement and executes precise trajectories even as the warehouse layout changes. This means workers don't need to reprogram the system each time workflows shift. One of KR1's most impressive features is its ability to learn from demonstration. Warehouse staff can guide the robot through a task once, and KR1 can replicate it accurately without complex coding. This speeds up onboarding and makes it easy to scale up operations. In a recent demo video, KR1 moved across a warehouse floor on its own. It approached various shelving units, selected a range of items, and placed them into totes with deliberate and smooth movements. It then transported the loaded containers to the correct location, all while avoiding obstacles and adjusting to its environment in real time.",
      "The Kinisi 01, also known as KR1, is a powerful autonomous humanoid robot. (Kinisi Robotics)",
      "This robot works offline without relying on cloud computing",
      "While many robots rely on cloud computing, Kinisi took a different approach. KR1 processes data locally, which means it can function reliably even in environments with weak or unstable internet connections. Local processing also improves response times and enhances data privacy. This design ensures KR1 continues working even during network disruptions. It also allows the robot to make split-second decisions, which is essential in fast-paced warehouses.",

      "Where this humanoid warehouse robot can work beyond logistics",
      "KR1 is already proving useful in logistics, but its design makes it suitable for a wide range of industries. In addition to streamlining warehouse fulfillment, KR1 is built to assist with tasks in retail stocking, light manufacturing, and maintenance work. Kinisi developed the robot to blend into existing workflows, which eliminates the need for expensive infrastructure upgrades. Because the robot combines physical strength with the ability to learn, it can handle repetitive tasks that require both accuracy and endurance. As a result, companies can reduce labor costs, improve workplace safety and increase operational flexibility.",
      "The Kinisi 01, also known as KR1, is a powerful autonomous humanoid robot. (Kinisi Robotics)",
      "How much does KR1 cost? Here's what we know",
      "During a recent presentation at Automate 2025, Kinisi CEO Brennand Pierce revealed that the robot currently costs around $4,000 per month. That rate appears to be part of a subscription-based model, which may include the robot, its onboard AI and ongoing support. Instead of selling KR1 outright, Kinisi is targeting small to mid-size warehouses with a flexible, monthly pricing strategy.",
      "This approach allows businesses to adopt automation without making large upfront investments or overhauling their infrastructure. Although the company hasn't confirmed what the monthly fee includes, the model positions KR1 as a scalable, low-risk solution for logistics teams looking to boost productivity fast.",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Kinisi KR1 shows that the future of work is already here. This robot lifts like a human, moves like a worker and learns like a fast-thinking employee. With rapid deployment, low maintenance and powerful onboard intelligence, KR1 offers a compelling solution to the rising demand for fast, flexible automation.",

    "summary": "TapTrap Android attack works by launching transparent system prompts over regular app interfaces. The result is a near-invisible layer that silently captures your taps and interactions.",
    "story": [
      "Google Maps Location Sharing is now built into Android settings; no need for Maps settings. Tech expert Kurt Knutsson discusses the welcome improvement for Android users.",
      "A team of academic researchers has uncovered a new Android security exploit that raises a lot of questions about the platform\u2019s permission system. The technique, named TapTrap, uses user interface animations to visually deceive you into granting sensitive permissions or performing harmful actions. Unlike earlier tapjacking attacks, TapTrap Android attack works by launching transparent system prompts over regular app interfaces. The result is a near-invisible layer that silently captures your taps and interactions.",

      "NEW GOOGLE AI MAKES ROBOTS SMARTER WITHOUT THE CLOUD",
      "A person holding an Android phone\u00a0(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How the TapTrap Android exploit tricks you into granting permissions",
      "As reported by Bleeping Computer, TapTrap takes advantage of how Android handles activity transitions between apps. A malicious app can launch a system-level screen using the standard start Activity function but modify how the screen appears using a custom animation. By setting both the start and end opacity to a very low value, such as 0.01, the activity becomes nearly invisible to the user.",
      "Touch input is still fully registered by the transparent screen, even though users only see the visible app underneath. Attackers can also apply a scaling animation that enlarges a specific user interface element, such as a permission button, so that it fills the screen. This increases the chance that a user will unknowingly tap the button.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "The researchers released a video showing how this technique could be used in a gaming app to quietly launch a Chrome browser permission prompt. The prompt asks for camera access, and the user taps \"Allow\" without realizing what they have done. Because the malicious screen is transparent, there are no visual cues to suggest anything suspicious is happening.",
      "Image of an Android phone\u00a0(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Why 76% of Android apps are vulnerable to TapTrap",
      "To assess how widespread the vulnerability might be, the researchers tested nearly 100,000 apps from the Play Store. About 76% were found to be potentially vulnerable, not because they are malicious, but because they lack key safeguards. These apps had at least one screen that could be launched by another app, shared the same task stack, failed to override the default transition animation, and did not block user input during the transition.",
      "Android enables these animations by default. Users can only disable them through settings that are typically hidden, such as Developer Options or Accessibility menus. Even the latest Android version, tested on a Google Pixel 8a, remains unprotected against this exploit.",
      "GrapheneOS, a security-focused operating system based on Android, confirmed that its current version is also affected. However, it plans to release a fix in its next update.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "Google has acknowledged the issue and said a future Android update will contain a mitigation. While no exact timeline has been announced, Google is expected to change how input and animations are handled to prevent invisible tap interception.",
      "The company added that developers must follow strict Play Store policies and that any app found abusing this vulnerability will face enforcement actions.",
      "A person holding an Android phone\u00a0(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "4 ways you can stay safe from TapTrap attack",
      "1) Consider a mobile security app:\u00a0Use a trusted antivirus or mobile security app that can detect suspicious behavior or alert you to apps using overlays or accessibility features improperly.",
      "Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android & iOS devices at\u00a0CyberGuy.com/LockUpYourTech",
      "2) Be selective about the apps you install:\u00a0Avoid installing apps just because they\u2019re trending or have flashy ads. Check developer credibility, recent reviews and app permissions before downloading.",
      "3) Stick to the Google Play Store:\u00a0While not perfect, the Play Store has better safeguards than random APK sources. Avoid installing apps from third-party stores or unknown websites.",
      "4) Pause before granting permissions:\u00a0If an app suddenly asks for access to your camera, microphone, or other sensitive features, take a moment. Always ask yourself if this app really needs this permission right now.",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "TapTrap shows that security threats do not always come from complex code or aggressive malware. Sometimes, small oversights in visual behavior can open paths for serious abuse. In this case, the danger lies in what users do not see. People trust what they can see on their screens. This attack breaks that link by creating a visual mismatch between intent and outcome.",

      "Jimmy Hoffa threatened to kick the mob out of the Teamsters, so the Detroit mafia and Teamsters president Frank Fitzsimmons killed him, says his son. (Fox Nation)",
      "Through the years, there have been various claims about where Hoffa was killed.",
      "One possibility was a local catering hall called the Raleigh House, which the FBI investigated and found no evidence tying it to the disappearance. Another location seems more likely, a mansion on a secluded knoll in Bloomfield Hills. The home was owned at the time by Detroit mob solider Carlo Licata, who was found shot to death on his bed in the house on July 30, 1981...exactly six years to the day from when Hoffa had vanished.",
      "\"I believe his death was a retaliation for what he knew about Jimmy Hoffa\u2019s murder,\" said Licata's cousin, Anne Licata-Solaas. \"He was going to expose it.\"",
      "Licata-Solaas has written a book about her family, \"The Scent of Lemons,\" that lays out the scenario that Carlo was murdered to keep him quiet about what happened to Hoffa.",
      "Authorities ruled Licata's death a \"suicide,\" and determined that Licata died instantly from a bullet to his heart. But Licata-Solaas doesn't buy it. The gun was found seven feet from Licata's body, resting neatly on his dresser chest of drawers.",
      "Fox Nation asked renowned Medical Examiner Dr. Michael Baden to review Licata's autopsy and police report. He doesn't think Licata killed himself either.",
      "\"The forensic evidence is that this is a homicide, not a suicide,\" said Baden. \"Someone else did this.\"",
      "Baden cites, among other reasons, that the gun was held a few inches away from Licata's body, there was no gunpowder residue on his hands which would have been left by a .357 magnum, and Licata would not have been able to die and then stand up to place the gun on the far side of the room and then lie down again.",
      "Investigators say Licata's house was the logical place to kill Jimmy Hoffa. It had a secluded garage that was hidden from the street, so the car with Hoffa could have pulled in without being noticed.",
      "Investigators believe Hoffa was murdered in this house, then owned by mobster Carlo Licata. His cousin tells Fox Nation that he was murdered in his bedroom exactly six years later because he was going to tell all about Hoffa\u2019s killing. (Fox Nation)",
      "\"It makes sense from the standpoint that it was probably the closest place they could take him and still have him believe that, okay, nothing bad was going to happen,\" former FBI agent Mike Cerone told Fox Nation.",
      "Carlo Licata's sons declined to comment.",
      "Over the years there have been claims that Hoffa was buried in the New Jersey Meadowlands, in various fields and under driveways in Michigan, under the massive Renaissance Center in downtown Detroit and under a baseball field in Wisconsin.",
      "The FBI last dug in 2022 under the Pulaski Skyway in Jersey City, N.J., at the site of an old mob-connected waste site, known as Moscato's dump. It was claimed that Hoffa was buried there in a barrel. The search came up empty.",
      "\"The answer is incredibly simple. Jimmy Hoffa never left Detroit,\" said Burnstein. \"This was something that probably happened in a 30 to 60-minute window on the afternoon of July 30, 1975. It happened in probably a 15-mile radius of where he was murdered.\"",

      "\"'Tony Jack\" came in and was walking around calmly, casually, studying the equipment and walking around it for 45 minutes to an hour,\" said Tubman.\u00a0He believes the mob capo was there to inspect where Hoffa's body was going to go.",

      "Ceasefire negotiations between Israel and the Hamas terrorist organization hit a setback Thursday, as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu recalled Israel\u2019s negotiating delegation from Doha following what officials described as a hardening of Hamas\u2019 demands.",
      "\"In light of the response Hamas delivered this morning, it has been decided to recall the negotiating team for further consultations in Israel,\" the Prime Minister\u2019s Office said in a statement. \"We appreciate the efforts of the mediators, Qatar and Egypt, and the efforts of envoy Steve Witkoff to achieve a breakthrough in the talks.\"",
      "According to reports in Israeli media, the terror group is now demanding the release of 200 Palestinians serving life sentences for murdering Israelis, and an additional 2,000 Palestinians detained in Gaza after Oct. 7.

      "A joint statement by 25 countries condemning Israel\u2019s conduct in Gaza may have further complicated already fragile ceasefire negotiations, Israeli officials suggested.

      "Hostage families expressed deep concern about the breakdown in negotiations. \"The families are watching with concern as reports emerge about the negotiating team\u2019s return,\" the Hostages and Missing Families Forum said in a statement. \"Every day that passes endangers the hostages\u2019 chances of recovery and the ability to locate the dead.

      "\u201cOut of respect for the office of the presidency, our office does not normally dignify the constant nonsense and misinformation flowing out of this White House with a response,\u201d Patrick Rodenbush, a spokesman for former President Barack Obama, said in a statement this week. \u201cBut these claims are outrageous enough to merit one. These bizarre allegations are ridiculous and a weak attempt at distraction.\u201d",
      "In advance of the 2016 election, intelligence reporting indicated Russia was trying to influence the election with disinformation, Miller said. After the vote, John Brennan \u2014 who was CIA director at the time and is now a paid NBC News and MSNBC contributor \u2014 asked her to put together a task force that would rigorously examine Russia\u2019s role in the election.",
      "Miller, who served nine tours abroad with CIA during her 39-year career, was head of agency counterintelligence at the time. She said she put together a team with a range of skills and expertise, including analysts and officers working in counterintelligence.",
      "As they began their work on the assessment, Miller said, she and the rest of her team were keenly aware of the polarized political climate in the country in the aftermath of the election. They were facing pressure from officials both inside and outside the CIA.",
      "\u201cThere were people that hated Trump that wanted us to find that Trump was complicit. And there were those that loved Trump. They wanted us to find nothing. And we ignored all of it,\u201d Miller said.",
      "\u201cWe just kept ourselves neutral,\u201d she added. \u201cWe just decided to let the data speak for itself. ... We had very, very good data coming in.\u201d",
      "Brennan did not pressure or micromanage the task force, she said. Gabbard, current CIA Director John Ratcliffe and the White House have accused Brennan of fabricating intelligence about the 2016 election to undermine Trump. Brennan has rejected the allegations as \u201cbaseless.\u201d",
      "The task force examined every possible angle, Miller said, including whether Trump and his campaign somehow conspired with the Kremlin to skew the election outcome. They did not find intelligence to support that scenario, she said.",
      "After sifting through all the intelligence and publicly available information, the team concluded that Russia had waged a large-scale information warfare campaign to undermine America\u2019s democratic process, damage Hillary Clinton\u2019s candidacy and boost Trump\u2019s chances.",
      "\u201cThe paper was multiple pages long, but the summary of it is 100% they tried to influence the election, and 100% we can\u2019t say if it worked unless we polled every voter,\u201d Miller said.",
      "When the assessment was wrapping up and a draft was being edited, then-FBI Director James Comey asked that the report include a dossier about Trump by a former British intelligence officer, Christopher Steele, according to Miller and a Senate report from 2020, which cited accounts from multiple officials, including Comey and Brennan. The dossier featured unverified allegations about Trump that had not been corroborated by U.S. intelligence agencies, and CIA officials argued against adding references to the dossier in the report.",
      "\u201cWe had already written the paper and it was going through edits,\u201d Miller said.",
      "The FBI\u2019s stance annoyed Miller. Her view was that \u201cwe can\u2019t just shove this in\u201d to the assessment at such a late stage and that \u201cit\u2019s going to take us another six months to go and try to figure out if this is true,\u201d she said.",
      "But the FBI insisted that if the dossier were not included, the bureau would withdraw and not endorse the intelligence assessment, according to Miller. \u201cThe FBI said that \u2018unless you tag it onto the end of it, then we\u2019re not going to sign off on this,\u2019\u201d she said.",
      "In the end, the CIA and the FBI worked out a compromise. The dossier was included in an annex to the assessment, with a disclaimer that the claims in the file had not been verified by the intelligence community.",
      "Comey could not be reached for comment.",
      "Later on during the first Trump administration, Miller was called up to the general counsel\u2019s office at the CIA. There, she said, an agency lawyer told her she was facing possible criminal charges over her role leading the assessment.",
      "Miller assumed it was a joke. \u201cI laughed out loud.\u201d But it was not.",
      "Miller decided to hire a lawyer, though it was unclear what potential criminal charge was in play. The administration eventually used a special counsel, John Durham, to investigate how the previous administration had handled probes into Russian election interference and the Trump campaign.",
      "Durham\u2019s team questioned Miller for hours. They asked her questions about whether she had an anti-Republican bias that influenced how the assessment was written, Miller said.",
      "\u201cI was answering questions like, \u2018Tell us how you hate all Republicans, and that\u2019s why you wrote this paper.\u2019 Actually, if you look at my registration, I\u2019m a Republican.\u201d",
      "Miller was never charged with any crime and she said she was never disciplined in any way over the intelligence assessment. She retired during the Biden administration after 39 years with the CIA.",
      "Earlier this month, Ratcliffe declassified an internal \u201clessons learned\u201d review looking at how the intelligence assessment was drafted. The internal review found that some standard procedures were not followed and that the report was rushed, but did not question the conclusions of the assessment.",
      "Miller said no one at the CIA contacted her for the internal review. The CIA declined to comment.",
      "Nine years since the 2016 election, Russia is likely pleased to see yet more political acrimony in Washington over what transpired, according to Miller.",
      "\u201cPutin and his BFFs in the Kremlin are toasting vodka shots as we speak at the turmoil this is creating,\u201d she said."

      "For baseball fans across the country, outfielder Ichiro Suzuki\u2019s induction into the Baseball Hall of Fame this weekend is the capstone to a storied career of broken records. But for players of Asian descent, it\u2019s also a profound moment of recognition and visibility.",
      "Suzuki, who spent the majority of his 19 years in Major League Baseball with the Seattle Mariners, will be the first Asian player to be added to the historic hall in Cooperstown, New York. Asian and Asian Americans across the league spoke to NBC News, reflecting on their favorite Suzuki moments and how his performance on the field helped usher in a generation of players who sought to follow in his footsteps.",
      "\u201cHe was a player who looked like me: Left-handed, played the outfield,\u201d said Cleveland Guardians outfielder Steven Kwan, who\u2019s of Japanese and Chinese descent. \u201cIt kind of gave me hope at a really young age to see that someone who looks like me, plays like me, is able to succeed at the highest level and, not only that, gain the respect of everybody in the league too.\u201d",
      "Suzuki joins starting pitcher CC Sabathia and relief pitcher Billy Wagner as part of the class of 2025 to be inducted on Sunday. Other inductees include the late right fielder Dave Parker and first baseman Dick Allen, who died in 2020.",
      "Suzuki, who missed a unanimous selection by a single vote, began his U.S. career in 2001 as the first Japanese position player to join MLB. While he wasn\u2019t the first ever player from Japan to join the big leagues \u2014 pitcher Masanori Murakami played a short stint with the San Francisco Giants in 1964, and Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Hideo Nomo had a 13-year career in the States \u2014 Suzuki was by far the most successful.",
      "In his almost two decades in the league, Suzuki made a name for himself as an elite contact hitter and a defensive genius who was also known to ham it up for those who played with him and serve impeccable style. His career includes 10 All-Star selections, 10 Gold Glove awards and three Silver Slugger awards. His time in MLB contributed to more Japanese players exploring careers in the U.S.",
      "Kwan, a two-time All-Star and three-time Gold Glove winner in his own right, said growing up, it was critical for him to see a player who never hid his Japanese heritage, always embraced his background and took the field as simply himself. Suzuki\u2019s baseball IQ also made a lasting impression on the Guardians outfielder. When Suzuki was on the Miami Marlins in 2015, he faked out Joaquin Arias of the San Francisco Giants, keeping Arias from scoring on a double to the right-field wall.",
      "\u201cHe was near the end of his career. \u2026 And even in his older age, he still had the baseball IQ to make it look like he was going to catch the ball, field the ball off the wall cleanly,\u201d Kwan said. \u201cI just remember that at the end of his career he was still making an impact. That was special to me.\u201d",
      "Arizona Diamondbacks outfielder Corbin Carroll said that as an Asian American who grew up in Seattle and frequently attended Mariners games, he was similarly in awe of Suzuki. Carroll, who\u2019s of Taiwanese descent, said he still remembers sitting in the right-field bleachers with his family as his mother snapped a photo of Suzuki striking his signature pose.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s one of my earliest memories. The photo I kept in my room as I was growing up and still have to this day,\u201d Carroll said.",
      "Carroll, who in 2023 became the first Asian American MLB Rookie of the Year, said that all those years watching the Japanese trailblazer \u201cmade me feel like maybe one day I could do it and play at that level,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cWhen kids grow up seeing someone who they can relate to in some way, it can inspire them and give them hope to do something big,\u201d Carroll, a two-time All-Star, said.",
      "Suzuki previously told NBC News that he didn\u2019t set out to \u201cperform for Asians\u201d but was more than aware that his performance would impact the group in addition to his home country of Japan. And he had to excel.",
      "\u201cAs a player from Japan, as a guy that had led the league in hitting all seven years, and then coming over being a first position player, I knew that I would be judged. And Japan baseball will be judged on how I did,\u201d Suzuki said. \u201cIf I wasn\u2019t able to produce, then they would judge Japan baseball as being at a lower level. And so that pressure was there and that\u2019s what I had to carry.\u201d",
      "Bryan Woo, an All-Star pitcher for the Mariners, admitted that as a player of Chinese descent from Oakland, California, he may not have been the biggest Seattle fan growing up, but he was a fan of Suzuki\u2019s. Woo said he was particularly struck by Suzuki\u2019s performance in the 2007 All-Star Game in San Francisco, during which he hit an inside-the-park home run. Suzuki, who was crowned MVP of that game, went 3-for-3 that night. And his dinger remains the only inside-the-park home run ever hit during an All-Star game.",
      "Woo said that these days, Suzuki, who still works for the Mariners as a special assistant to the chairman, continues to dispense his wisdom, ensuring that progress doesn\u2019t stop with his own playing career.",
      "\u201cGuys that have his career and his caliber don\u2019t have to do stuff like that, but people that do that go out of their way. That means a lot.\u201d Woo said.",
      "Ultimately, Kwan said, Suzuki\u2019s place in the Hall of Fame is symbolic of a new era.",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s just showing that one person needs to pave the way for a whole generation to believe that they can play baseball,\u201d Kwan said."

      "Former prosecutors said it was highly unusual \u2014 and potentially unprecedented \u2014 for a the department\u2019s No. 2 official to personally interview a witness. Secrecy in a criminal investigation is normal, but the prosecutors involved in the case would typically be included in questioning.",

      "Victims of Epstein and Maxwell, who was convicted in 2021 of recruiting and grooming multiple teenage girls to be sexually abused by the late financier, questioned the lack of transparency as well. Jack Scarola, a lawyer representing roughly 20 Epstein victims, said he asked to attend the Maxwell interviews but was not included.",

FBI Director Kash Patel and Deputy Director Dan Bongino \u2014 who have both spread conspiracy theories about the Epstein case \u2014 backed those findings and a DOJ decision to release no other Epstein case documents.",
      "Catherine Christian, a former Manhattan assistant district attorney and an NBC News legal analyst, said the Maxwell interviews could also be an effort to protect Trump, who now faces one of the largest political crises of his second term in the furor over the Epstein investigation.",
      "Trump, like dozens of other wealthy Americans, socialized with Epstein. He is among hundreds of individuals whose names appear in 100,000 pages of Epstein case documents reviewed by the DOJ and the FBI.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s hard to believe this is anything but performative,\u201d Christian said. \u201cOr Todd Blanche, just wanting to have her on the record saying, \u2018Yes, President Trump had nothing to do with any of this. He was not a client.\u2019\u201d",
      "What was Maxwell asked?",
      "Maxwell\u2019s lawyer, David Oscar Markus, is a top Florida criminal defense lawyer and a friend of Blanche\u2019s. Blanche appeared on Markus\u2019 podcast in 2024, where the host praised Blanche\u2019s legal skills. After Friday\u2019s meeting with Blanche and Maxwell, Markus told reporters that the deputy attorney general \u201cdid an amazing job\u201d and asked Maxwell thorough questions.",
      "\u201cShe was asked maybe about 100 different people,\u201d said Markus, who did not disclose which individuals Maxwell was questioned about. \u201cShe answered questions about everybody, and she didn\u2019t hold anything back,\u201d he said. \u201cThey asked about every single, every possible thing you could imagine, everything.\u201d",
      "A senior administration official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly, said that Maxwell was granted limited immunity by the Justice Department to answer questions about the Epstein case.",
      "Granting limited immunity is common in criminal cases and allows defendants to provide information without fear that it will be used against them in court.",
      "The immunity is \u201climited\u201d because it only applies if the defendant is telling the truth. If it is determined that a defendant lied during the interviews, then the agreement becomes void. Prosecutors can take into consideration a defendant\u2019s cooperation and recommend a plea deal or a reduced sentence.",
      "This is not expected in Maxwell\u2019s case, as she has already been convicted and sentenced to 20 years in federal prison. Maxwell\u2019s lawyer, Markus, has argued that Maxwell\u2019s trial was unfair and an appeal of her conviction is pending before the Supreme Court.",
      "Potential pardon or commutation",
      "Trump, like all presidents, has the power to pardon or commute the sentence of anyone convicted of a federal crime. Asked about Epstein\u2019s case on Friday morning, Trump said the focus should be on other people who socialized with Epstein, such as former President Bill Clinton and Larry Summers, the former treasury secretary and Harvard University president.",
      "\u201cYou should focus on Clinton,\u201d the president told reporters. \u201cYou should focus on the president of Harvard, the former president of Harvard. You should focus on some of the hedge fund guys.\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019ll give you a list. These guys lived with Jeffrey Epstein. I sure as hell didn\u2019t,\u201d Trump said.",
      "Asked if he was considering granting Maxwell a pardon or commuting her sentence, Trump said, \u201cIt\u2019s something I haven\u2019t thought about.\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019m allowed to do it,\u201d he added.",
      "Mimi Rocah, a former federal prosecutor in New York, said she believes the recent firing of Maurene Comey, a lead prosecutor in the Maxwell case and the daughter of former FBI Director James Comey, was an effort to give Trump appointees full control of the Maxwell case, limit transparency and silence dissent.",
      "\u201cThat does not seem coincidental. It seems like they wanted Maurene not to be present in the Department of Justice,\u201d Rocah said. \u201cTo be able to say, \u2018What the heck, you can\u2019t go talk to my defendant.\u2019\u201d",
      "Rocah, a Democrat who served as Westchester County district attorney from 2020 to 2024, criticized Blanche\u2019s meetings with Maxwell, saying his apparent failure to include a prosecutor with deep knowledge of her crimes was unfair to Epstein\u2019s victims.",
      "\u201cThe head of that entire institution that is supposed to be about protecting victims is talking to her, giving her a platform to say God knows what, without much way to verify it or not,\u201d Rocah said. \u201cThe real people who could test her truth-telling are the people who worked on the case, not Todd.\u201d"

      "Texas\u2019 unscheduled redistricting effort \u2014 which Republicans hope could help protect their narrow House majority during next year\u2019s midterm elections \u2014 has had a ripple effect, with governors across the country floating the possibility of following suit to either add to or counter or the plan, depending on their party affiliation.",
      "At the summer meeting of the bipartisan National Governors Association in Colorado Springs, Democrats largely condemned the efforts in Texas while cheering on efforts by members of their own party in other states.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s deplorable,\u201d New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy, a Democrat, said in an interview on the sidelines of the summit, referring to Texas Republicans\u2019 attempt.",
      "When it came to threats by Democratic Govs. Gavin Newsom of California and Kathy Hochul of New York to forge ahead with plans to redraw congressional lines in their states, Murphy added, \u201cI don\u2019t think we have a choice.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf they\u2019re going to play these games, we\u2019re going to have to be just as aggressive,\u201d Murphy said, adding that \u201cwe can\u2019t bring a knife to a gunfight.\u201d",
      "Asked if he\u2019d condone a redistricting effort in New Jersey, Murphy said \u201call options are on the table in New Jersey,\u201d though he acknowledged that there were major obstacles to doing so.",
      "\u201cI fear there are significant constitutional constraints here in our own [state] constitution,\u201d he said. In New Jersey, like in many other states, an independent commission oversees redistricting.",

      "\u201cIt\u2019s turning into a knife fight,\u201d Green said.",
      "Texas Republican Gov. Greg Abbott kicked off a special legislative session on Monday, with congressional redistricting one of the topics on lawmakers\u2019 to-do list.",
      "The New York Times reported last month that members of Trump\u2019s political operation had privately urged Texas Republicans to redraw their maps ahead of the 2026 midterms. And Trump himself has publicly praised the efforts, urging Texas lawmakers to take actions that would help the GOP gain five House seats. Republicans currently control 25 of Texas\u2019 38 congressional districts.",
      "The redistricting process typically occurs at the start of each new decade, when new census data is available. Texas\u2019 current maps were drawn in 2021, following the 2020 census, though they are still being fought over in court.",
      "The Republican effort in Texas has prompted some Democrats to fight back by threatening their own mid-decade redistricting schemes. Most prominently, Newsom, a potential 2028 presidential contender, has raised the idea of redrawing California\u2019s maps. But that effort would come with major obstacles: An independent commission controls the redistricting process in California, not the governor.",
      "On Thursday, Hochul entered the fray as well, responding to a question about redistricting in New York by saying: \u201cAll\u2019s fair in love and war,\u201d according to Politico. While not promising action, she added that she\u2019d \u201clook at it closely with\u201d House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y.",
      "Elsewhere, Illinois\u2019 Democratic Gov. JB Pritzker responded to a question about whether his state should pursue redistricting to counterbalance Texas\u2019 push by accusing Republicans of trying to \u201ccheat\u201d ahead of the midterms. And a spokesman for Maryland\u2019s Democratic Gov. Wes Moore told The New York Times this week he will \u201ccontinue to evaluate all options.\u201d",
      "On the other side of the aisle, just days after the state Supreme Court upheld the state\u2019s newest congressional map, Florida\u2019s Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis said that \u201cthere may be more defects that need to be remedied.\u201d He added that population shifts in the state since the census has led him to believe the state is \u201cmalapportioned\u201d and that it \u201cwould be appropriate to do a redistricting here in the mid-decade.\u201d",
      "And in Ohio, state lawmakers are required to draw new congressional maps before 2026 because their current lines passed without bipartisan support. Republicans control 10 of Ohio\u2019s 15 House seats.",
      "Other Democratic leaders at the NGA did not urge their party\u2019s fellow governors to move forward with their own redistricting plans.",
      "\u201cI would really call upon Texas Republicans to not yield to the temptation and to stick with the map that they themselves drew that benefits Republicans in the Texas delegation and continue with that until the normal redistricting period occurs at the end of the decade,\u201d Colorado Gov. Jared Polis said in an interview. In Colorado, like in California, redistricting efforts are overseen by an independent commission.",
      "Meanwhile, some Republicans at the NGA expressed displeasure with the redistricting threats from both parties.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ll be perfectly honest. I only think about it once every 10 years,\u201d Utah GOP Gov. Spencer Cox said in an interview. \u201cObviously, there\u2019s concerns about gerrymandering, and both sides are doing it \u2014 you know, nobody has clean hands.\u201d",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t love it. I wish there was a better way. I wish there was a nonpartisan way. Lots of states have tried,\u201d Cox added.",
      "Former Colorado Gov. Bill Owens, a Republican, said he\u2019d refuse to condemn Texas\u2019 efforts, even though he himself helped Colorado advance its own independent redistricting commission.",
      "\u201cSo long as so many Democratic states still redistrict the old-fashioned way, so will Republican states. So I have no criticism for Texas, given that they\u2019re working within the same rules that have governed so many states \u2014 Democrats and Republicans \u2014 in the past,\u201d Owens said. He added that his own approach, if he were still governor, \u201cwould be to try to do redistricting in a bipartisan fashion.\u201d"

      "Suzuki, who spent the majority of his 19 years in Major League Baseball with the Seattle Mariners, will be the first Asian player to be added to the historic hall in Cooperstown, New York. Asian and Asian Americans across the league spoke to NBC News, reflecting on their favorite Suzuki moments and how his performance on the field helped usher in a generation of players who sought to follow in his footsteps.",
      "\u201cHe was a player who looked like me: Left-handed, played the outfield,\u201d said Cleveland Guardians outfielder Steven Kwan, who\u2019s of Japanese and Chinese descent. \u201cIt kind of gave me hope at a really young age to see that someone who looks like me, plays like me, is able to succeed at the highest level and, not only that, gain the respect of everybody in the league too.\u201d",
      "Suzuki joins starting pitcher CC Sabathia and relief pitcher Billy Wagner as part of the class of 2025 to be inducted on Sunday. Other inductees include the late right fielder Dave Parker and first baseman Dick Allen, who died in 2020.",
      "Suzuki, who missed a unanimous selection by a single vote, began his U.S. career in 2001 as the first Japanese position player to join MLB. While he wasn\u2019t the first ever player from Japan to join the big leagues \u2014 pitcher Masanori Murakami played a short stint with the San Francisco Giants in 1964, and Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Hideo Nomo had a 13-year career in the States \u2014 Suzuki was by far the most successful.",
      "In his almost two decades in the league, Suzuki made a name for himself as an elite contact hitter and a defensive genius who was also known to ham it up for those who played with him and serve impeccable style. His career includes 10 All-Star selections, 10 Gold Glove awards and three Silver Slugger awards. His time in MLB contributed to more Japanese players exploring careers in the U.S.",
      "Kwan, a two-time All-Star and three-time Gold Glove winner in his own right, said growing up, it was critical for him to see a player who never hid his Japanese heritage, always embraced his background and took the field as simply himself. Suzuki\u2019s baseball IQ also made a lasting impression on the Guardians outfielder. When Suzuki was on the Miami Marlins in 2015, he faked out Joaquin Arias of the San Francisco Giants, keeping Arias from scoring on a double to the right-field wall.",
      "\u201cHe was near the end of his career. \u2026 And even in his older age, he still had the baseball IQ to make it look like he was going to catch the ball, field the ball off the wall cleanly,\u201d Kwan said. \u201cI just remember that at the end of his career he was still making an impact. That was special to me.\u201d",
      "Arizona Diamondbacks outfielder Corbin Carroll said that as an Asian American who grew up in Seattle and frequently attended Mariners games, he was similarly in awe of Suzuki. Carroll, who\u2019s of Taiwanese descent, said he still remembers sitting in the right-field bleachers with his family as his mother snapped a photo of Suzuki striking his signature pose.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s one of my earliest memories. The photo I kept in my room as I was growing up and still have to this day,\u201d Carroll said.",
      "Carroll, who in 2023 became the first Asian American MLB Rookie of the Year, said that all those years watching the Japanese trailblazer \u201cmade me feel like maybe one day I could do it and play at that level,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cWhen kids grow up seeing someone who they can relate to in some way, it can inspire them and give them hope to do something big,\u201d Carroll, a two-time All-Star, said.",
      "Suzuki previously told NBC News that he didn\u2019t set out to \u201cperform for Asians\u201d but was more than aware that his performance would impact the group in addition to his home country of Japan. And he had to excel.",
      "\u201cAs a player from Japan, as a guy that had led the league in hitting all seven years, and then coming over being a first position player, I knew that I would be judged. And Japan baseball will be judged on how I did,\u201d Suzuki said. \u201cIf I wasn\u2019t able to produce, then they would judge Japan baseball as being at a lower level. And so that pressure was there and that\u2019s what I had to carry.\u201d",
      "Bryan Woo, an All-Star pitcher for the Mariners, admitted that as a player of Chinese descent from Oakland, California, he may not have been the biggest Seattle fan growing up, but he was a fan of Suzuki\u2019s. Woo said he was particularly struck by Suzuki\u2019s performance in the 2007 All-Star Game in San Francisco, during which he hit an inside-the-park home run. Suzuki, who was crowned MVP of that game, went 3-for-3 that night. And his dinger remains the only inside-the-park home run ever hit during an All-Star game.",
      "Woo said that these days, Suzuki, who still works for the Mariners as a special assistant to the chairman, continues to dispense his wisdom, ensuring that progress doesn\u2019t stop with his own playing career.",
      "\u201cGuys that have his career and his caliber don\u2019t have to do stuff like that, but people that do that go out of their way. That means a lot.\u201d Woo said.",
      "Ultimately, Kwan said, Suzuki\u2019s place in the Hall of Fame is symbolic of a new era.",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s just showing that one person needs to pave the way for a whole generation to believe that they can play baseball,\u201d Kwan said."

    "summary": "Homeless shelters in Los Angeles are becoming another target of the Trump administration's deportation efforts. One that caters to young people was recently raided by ICE agents.",
    "story": [
      "LOS ANGELES \u2014 Immigration officials have been repeatedly spotted outside a Hollywood homeless shelter since May, leading staff to accompany residents from war-torn countries to work, errands and court.",
      "An executive at the shelter that serves people ages 18 to 24 said she saw two Venezuelan men handcuffed and arrested by ICE agents after they returned to the shelter from work.",
      "\u201cThere was no conversation,\u201d said the employee, Lailanie, who asked that her last name not be used because she feared retribution from Immigration and Customs Enforcement.",
      "She said about half a dozen immigration officers went up to the residents \u201cand put their hands behind their backs right away.\u201d",
      "Homeless shelters appear to be another target in the Trump administration\u2019s ongoing immigration crackdown, which has resulted in nearly 3,000 arrests in the Los Angeles area. They now join Home Depots, 7-Elevens and cannabis farms as locations where the federal government is carrying out its mass deportation effort.",
      "In addition to the Hollywood shelter, service providers have reported seeing immigration enforcement at shelters in North Hollywood and San Diego, according to local media.",
      "Immigration officials did not respond to an email asking if homeless shelters are being targeted as part of enforcement efforts.",
      "With more than than 72,300 unhoused people, Los Angeles County is the epicenter of the nation\u2019s homelessness crisis. How many of them are immigrants is unknown because the federally mandated annual count does not include citizenship questions.",
      "The encounter at the Hollywood shelter took place a few weeks before President Donald Trump ordered the National Guard and U.S. Marines to the region in response to large-scale protests against his deportation efforts.",
      "Service providers in Los Angeles said the stepped-up enforcement effort has made their work more difficult because their clients are consumed by fears of deportation.",
      "Donald Whitehead Jr., executive director of the National Coalition for the Homeless, said the aggressive operation \u201cputs a target\u201d on the backs of homeless immigrants.",
      "\u201cIt villainizes them,\u201d he said.",
      "At another shelter, The People Concern in downtown Los Angeles, fewer clients are stopping by to use showers and other public facilities because they are afraid ICE agents will show up, said CEO John Maceri.",
      "He said even U.S. citizens at its permanent housing facility in the San Fernando Valley are hesitant to go outside because they are afraid they will be stopped and questioned by ICE.",
      "\u201cFrankly, anybody who\u2019s dark-skinned, Black and brown people, but particularly dark-skinned brown people, don\u2019t want to go out,\u201d Maceri said. \u201cThey don\u2019t want to go to the grocery store. A few of them are missing work. They\u2019re really scared. This fear factor is really taking effect.\u201d",
      "The highest concentrations of ICE arrests in Los Angeles have occurred in the predominantly Latino neighborhoods of the San Fernando Valley, according to the nonprofit Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights, or CHIRLA.",
      "U.S. Sen. Alex Padilla, who is from the San Fernando Valley and was himself handcuffed by federal agents last month at a news conference by Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, said the numbers reflect a strategy by the Trump administration to target vulnerable communities, not just the violent criminals he promised to arrest during his campaign.",
      "\u201cThis is an administration who proudly changed policy to pursue these enforcement actions in workplaces, in schools, including elementary schools, and houses of worship,\u201d he said. \u201cIf they were only focusing on dangerous, violent criminals, you\u2019re not going to find them at schools and churches and homeless camps.\u201d",
      "A map released Tuesday by CHIRLA showed that 471 of the 2,800 arrests made by the Department of Homeland Security from June 6 to July 20 occurred in predominantly Latino neighborhoods in the San Fernando Valley. It did not specify how many of the arrestees were homeless people.",
      "CHIRLA President Angelica Salas said the data highlighted \u201cracial profiling\u201d by federal officials, who have denied targeting people based on their skin color.",
      "\u201cWhat makes someone a target of ICE is if they are illegally in the U.S. \u2014 NOT their skin color, race, or ethnicity,\u201d DHS said in a recent statement.",
      "On Thursday, Trump signed an executive order that encourages cities to remove homeless people from their streets. Whitehead said the order could trigger more arrests of homeless people and further heighten their fears.",
      "At the homeless shelter where the two Venezuelan men were arrested, residents remain on high alert, Lailanie said. Immigrants are now accompanied to work, errands and court appointments by staff in unmarked cars without the organization\u2019s logo.",
      "Officials at the shelter requested that its name not be used out of fear of retribution by the Trump administration.",
      "The Venezuelans, who are 20 and 22 years old, barely speak English and had been living at the shelter for a few weeks before they were arrested, she said.",
      "They had not been there long enough to be paired with immigration lawyers, she said. The 22-year-old was deported, and employees have been unable to locate the younger man, she said.",
      "Since the arrests, staff members have witnessed at least three immigration stakeouts around the facility, two shelter employees said.",
      "On one occasion, a uniformed officer asked to use a bathroom inside the center. A maintenance worker allowed him to enter because he didn\u2019t know what else to do, the two employees said.",
      "Staffers have also seen unmarked black SUVs parked near the center and in the parking lot.",
      "Most recently, an asylum-seeker from the Democratic Republic of Congo who had been living at the shelter was arrested after reporting to immigration court, according to two people who work at the shelter.",
      "The employees said that before his arrest, he had difficulty applying for jobs because he wore an ankle monitor, which was given to him when he presented himself to immigration officials.",
      "Confused, he went to immigration court and asked officials to remove the monitor, the two employees said, but he was arrested instead. He was taken to the High Desert Detention Center in Adelanto, California, while his lawyer pleaded his asylum case, which is still pending, according to Lailanie.",
      "He fears being returned to central Africa, where his father was killed, she said.",
      "\u201cPeople are scared and people are hurting, but people are also compelled to continue to do the work and do the right thing and try to fight for the right thing,\u201d she said."

    "story": [
      "BAKERSFIELD, Calif. \u2014 When Rep. David Valadao, R-Calif., was knocked out of office in 2018, Democrats around the country were riding a wave of backlash against President Donald Trump and the GOP\u2019s attempts to cut health care.",
      "Now, after Valadao provided a critical vote for a sweeping tax cuts and spending package that slashed Medicaid and food stamps, Democrats see an opportunity for a repeat in California\u2019s Central Valley, where many low-income residents depend on social safety net programs.",
      "Valadao has already drawn at least two Democratic challengers in his battleground district, which will be key to Republicans\u2019 efforts to hang on to their narrow majority in next year\u2019s midterm elections. These include Jasmeet Bains, a doctor and member of the California state Assembly who officially jumped into the race last week. She told NBC News she was motivated by Valadao\u2019s support for the bill and plans to make health care a defining issue in the campaign against him.",
      "\u201cThis isn\u2019t something that I ever envisioned for myself. I\u2019m a doctor,\u201d Bains said of her decision to run for Congress. \u201cWhen I saw Valadao vote for the \u2018big, beautiful bill,\u2019 I was shocked. As was everyone. How could you do that in a district that has some of the highest needs? Some of the highest Medicaid patients in the country?\u201d",
      "Randy Villegas, a school board trustee who is affiliated with the Working Families Party, is also mounting a bid in the 22nd District.",
      "Even prior to his vote on the megabill, Valadao was seen as one of the more vulnerable Republicans up for re-election in 2026. After he lost in 2018, Valadao made a comeback bid and returned to Congress the following cycle. But his vote for Trump\u2019s bill could now put his swing seat even more at risk. Valadao\u2019s district has the highest share of Medicaid recipients and households receiving food stamps of any represented by a Republican in Congress, according to an NBC News analysis.",
      "In a preview of the attack ads to come, House Majority Forward, a nonprofit group aligned with Democratic leadership, and the League of Conservation Voters are launching new ads next week hitting Valadao over his support for the bill, according to a source familiar with the matter.",
      "The agriculturally rich region, which relies heavily on migrant farmworkers, is also bracing for mass deportations that some fear could disrupt the local economy and national food supply chains. Valadao has urged Trump to prioritize deporting criminals over undocumented laborers, but the administration has sent mixed signals about its approach.",
      "It all has the community here on edge.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m definitely scared. I\u2019m worried about it,\u201d 53-year-old Rick Garcia, a local resident who relies on Medicaid after he was permanently paralyzed in his early 20s, told NBC News in an interview about the health care cuts.",
      "Valadao had repeatedly vowed to oppose the \u201cbig, beautiful bill,\u201d warning just several days before final passage that he couldn\u2019t support the Senate product. But he ended up supporting that version without any changes to the legislation.",
      "When asked how he felt about Valadao\u2019s vote, Garcia told NBC News: \u201cBetrayed.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf you\u2019re a politician and you\u2019re gonna say you\u2019re gonna do something, you\u2019re relying on that politician to do something about that problem,\u201d Garcia said. \u201cBe a man of your word.\u201d",
      "Republicans argue that only those they say don\u2019t deserve to be on Medicaid, like undocumented immigrants and able-bodied adults who don\u2019t work, will be kicked off the program. But Garcia said the state\u2019s Medicaid program, Medi-Cal, has already tried to remove him twice before, so he worries people could erroneously get swept up in all the new changes or will struggle to navigate the more frequent eligibility check-ins.",
      "The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office projected Trump\u2019s new law will increase the number of people without health insurance by 10 million by 2034.",
      "Valadao\u2019s office said the congressman was not available for an interview for this story. In a statement after the House vote on the bill earlier this month, Valadao defended his decision.",
      "\u201cI voted for this bill because it does preserve the Medicaid program for its intended recipients \u2014 children, pregnant women, the disabled, and elderly,\u201d he said.",
      "Christian Martinez, a spokesman for the National Republican Campaign Committee, said the bill that Valadao voted for will \u201cease the burden on hardworking Californians\u201d and took a swipe at Villegas and Bains.",
      "\u201cTheir far-left agenda will continue to wreck California\u2019s economy, raise taxes, and put illegal immigrants ahead of California families,\u201d Martinez said.",
      "Valadao has stood up to his own party before. Most notably, he was one of 10 House Republicans who voted to impeach Trump in 2021 following the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol. But Trump has since further tightened his grip on the party, even threatening to back primary challenges to Republicans who stood in the way of his \u201cbig, beautiful bill.\u201d",
      "The sprawling domestic policy bill extends Trump\u2019s 2017 tax cuts, removes some taxes on tips and overtime, and beefs up funding for immigration enforcement and the military. While the legislation is generally unpopular in public polling, Republicans are betting once they start selling it, their members will be rewarded for supporting it.",
      "Some local business owners in Valadao\u2019s district hailed the bill and praised Valadao for backing it.",
      "Rob Taylor, who has owned Stafford\u2019s Chocolates in Porterville for the last 14 years, said he thinks some of the bill\u2019s tax provisions will be a boon for small businesses like his.",
      "\u201cI appreciate Valadao sticking up for himself and his constituents here,\u201d Taylor, who has voted for Valadao in the past, told NBC News. \u201cHe\u2019s not just a rubber stamp. He does look at both sides [of an issue].\u201d",
      "In order to partially pay for the bill, Republicans opted to scale back Medicaid and food stamps. That includes instituting new work requirements for able-bodied adults, making undocumented immigrants ineligible for the program and putting new restrictions on the state provider tax, which is a significant source of revenue for rural hospitals.",
      "Moderate Republicans fended off even steeper cuts to Medicaid that had been in the mix during the negotiations, such as reducing the federal cost-sharing formula. But Valadao acknowledged he still harbors concerns over some of the Medicaid changes, particularly those impacting rural hospitals.",
      "Access to health care in rural areas can already be difficult. Often, facilities are dependent on help from the government to stay afloat. Kern Hospital in Bakersfield, a social safety net hospital, gets 72% of its patient revenue from Medi-Cal.",
      "Then there are rural health clinics, like the Bakersfield American Indian Health Project, where Garcia receives some of his care. These clinics rely on various revenue streams from the federal government and provide critical preventive care services to many low-income patients on Medicaid.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no frills here. No one\u2019s taking advantage of anything. They\u2019re trying to survive,\u201d Dr. Carson Chambers, a clinical psychologist at the Bakersfield American Indian Health Project, told NBC News.",
      "Asked about the impacts of the Medicaid cuts, Chambers said: \u201cIt may be well-intentioned, it may be fiscally sound, but in the long run, I think it\u2019s going to cost more.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "TOKYO \u2014 As President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs add to a sense of uncertainty in Japan, more voters here are embracing an idea inspired by their longtime ally the United States: \u201cJapanese first.\u201d",
      "The nationalist slogan helped the right-wing populist party Sanseito make big gains in Japan\u2019s parliamentary elections on Sunday, as it capitalized on economic malaise and concerns about immigration and overtourism.",
      "Party leader Sohei Kamiya, who since 2022 had held Sanseito\u2019s only seat in the upper house of Japan\u2019s parliament, will now be joined by 14 others in the 248-seat chamber. It\u2019s a far cry from the party\u2019s origin as a fringe anti-vaccination group on YouTube during the Covid-19 pandemic.",
      "Though Japan has long had a complex relationship with foreigners and its cultural identity, experts say Sanseito\u2019s rise is another indication of the global shift to the right embodied and partly fueled by Trump, with populist figures gaining ground in Europe, Britain, Latin America and elsewhere.",
      "Kamiya \u201cfancies himself a mini-Trump\u201d and \u201cis one of those who Trump has put wind in his sails,\u201d said Jeff Kingston, a professor of Asian studies and history at Temple University\u2019s Japan campus.",
      "Speaking at a rally on Saturday at Tokyo\u2019s Shiba Park, Kamiya said his calls for greater restrictions on foreign workers and investment were driven not by xenophobia but by \u201cthe workings of globalization.\u201d He criticized mainstream parties\u2019 support for boosting immigration in an effort to address the labor shortage facing Japan\u2019s aging and shrinking population.",
      "\u201cJapan is still the fourth-largest economy in the world. We have 120 million people. Why do we have to rely on foreign capital?\u201d Kamiya told an enthusiastic crowd.",
      "The election results were disastrous for Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, who is facing calls to resign now that his conservative Liberal Democratic Party \u2014 which has ruled almost uninterrupted since the end of World War II \u2014 has lost its majority in both houses of parliament.",
      "The Japanese leader had also been under pressure to reach a trade deal with the Trump administration, which said Tuesday that the two sides had agreed to a 15% U.S. tariff on Japanese goods.",
      "On Wednesday, Ishiba denied reports that he planned to step down by the end of August.",
      "The message from his party\u2019s string of election losses is that \u201cpeople are unhappy,\u201d Kingston said.",
      "\u201cA lot of people feel that the status quo is biased against their interests and it advantages the elderly over the young, and the young feel sort of resentful that they\u2019re having to carry the heavy burden of the growing aging population on their back,\u201d he said.",
      "Kamiya, 47, an energetic speaker with social media savvy, is also a strong contrast to leaders such as Ishiba and the Constitutional Democrats\u2019 Yoshihiko Noda, both 68, who \u201clook like yesterday\u2019s men\u201d and the faces of the establishment, Kingston said.",
      "With voters concerned about stagnating wages, surging prices and bleak employment prospects, \u201cthe change-makers got a lot of protest votes from people who feel disenfranchised,\u201d he said.",
      "Sanseito\u2019s platform resonated with voters such as Yuta Kato.",
      "\u201cThe number of [foreign immigrants] who don\u2019t obey rules is increasing. People don\u2019t voice it, but I think they feel that,\u201d the 38-year-old hairdresser told Reuters in Tokyo. \u201cAlso, the burden on citizens including taxes is getting bigger and bigger, so life is getting more difficult.\u201d",
      "The biggest reason Sanseito did well in the election, he said, \u201cis that they are speaking on behalf of us.\u201d",
      "Kamiya\u2019s party was not the only upstart to benefit from voter discontent, with the center-right Democratic Party for the People increasing its number of seats in the upper house from five to 16.",
      "Sanseito, whose name means \u201cParticipate in Politics,\u201d originated in 2020 amid the Covid-19 pandemic, attracting conservatives with YouTube videos promoting conspiracy theories about vaccines and pushing back against mask mandates. Its YouTube channel now has almost 480,000 subscribers.",
      "The party has also warned about a \u201csilent invasion\u201d of foreigners in Japan, where the number of foreign residents rose more than 10% last year to a record of almost 3.8 million, according to the Immigration Services Agency. It remains far lower as a proportion of the population than in the U.S. or Europe, however.",
      "Critics say such rhetoric has fueled hate speech and growing hostility toward foreigners in Japan, citing a survey last month by Japanese broadcaster NHK and others in which almost two-thirds of respondents agreed that foreigners received \u201cpreferential treatment.\u201d",
      "At the Sanseito rally on Saturday, protesters held up signs that said \u201cNo Hate\u201d and \u201cRacists Go Home.\u201d",
      "Kamiya denies that his party is hostile to foreigners in Japan.",
      "\u201cWe have no intention of discriminating against foreigners, nor do we have any intention of inciting division,\u201d he said Monday. \u201cWe\u2019re just aiming to firmly rebuild the lives of Japanese people who are currently in trouble.\u201d",
      "Despite its electoral advances, Sanseito doesn\u2019t have enough members in the upper house to make much impact on its own and has only three seats in the more powerful lower house. The challenge, Kingston said, is whether Kamiya can \u201ctake this anger, the malaise, and bring his show nationwide.\u201d"

      "The best compact strollers of 2025",
      "Bugaboo Butterfly 2",
      "The Bugaboo Butterfly 2 became my go-to for city errands and weekend outings. It folds with one hand (a lifesaver when you\u2019re holding a baby and wrangling toddler gear), fits easily into my trunk and has a basket big enough for my oversized diaper bag and snacks. The extended hood provides actual shade, not just a strip of fabric, and the peekaboo window lets me check in on the baby without disrupting nap time. It\u2019s smooth, thoughtfully designed and easy to love \u2014 but it is definitely on the pricier side.",
      "Colugo Compact Stroller",
      "This modern stroller understands the assignment. The one-handed, two-second fold fits in airplane bins, which is a dream when juggling travel gear. My 9-month-old naps easily thanks to the multi-position recline and canopy, while the adjustable calf rest works well for my toddler. The ride is smooth, and the deep storage basket carries everything I need. However, the brake is a little too easy to trigger accidentally with longer legs, and it\u2019s not newborn-ready unless you purchase the bassinet separately.",
      "Doona Infant Car Seat & Stroller",
      "A favorite among new parents for a reason, the Doona transitions from car seat to stroller in seconds. It\u2019s a travel game-changer, especially when your baby falls asleep in the car and you don\u2019t want to wake them. It\u2019s also a space-saver for tight elevators and restaurants. That said, it\u2019s heavy and has a short shelf life \u2014 once your baby outgrows the infant stage, it\u2019s done.",
      "DFY R1 Stroller",
      "This one earned my husband\u2019s rare stamp of approval. With a height-adjustable handle, both of us can push comfortably. The seat reclines fully and grows with your child without the need for inserts. The magnetic buckle feels secure and prevents accidental pinches. While the design is sleek and the ride is sturdy, folding it takes some practice and it\u2019s too bulky for air travel.",
      "Silver Cross Jet\u202f5 Stroller",
      "If you\u2019re a frequent flyer, this one\u2019s for you. The Jet 5 folds into a suitcase shape and stands on its own, perfect for gate-checking or tucking into overhead bins. My baby naps well in the lie-flat seat and the generous canopy helps with sleep on the go. It\u2019s sleek, light and feels luxe, though the storage is minimal and add-on accessories like snack trays and rain covers cost extra.",
      "Beberoad Love R1 Stroller",
      "This under-the-radar pick was a pleasant surprise. It\u2019s incredibly light but still stable over gravel and sidewalks. I was impressed by how secure my 9-month-old felt in the seat. It opens and closes easily, which makes errands faster. The brand is lesser-known and details can be sparse, and while it\u2019s great for babies, it won\u2019t work for my toddler due to weight limits.",
      "UPPAbaby Minu V3 Stroller",
      "This one feels like the luxury sedan of compact strollers. It glides smoothly, folds easily and includes thoughtful features like a peekaboo canopy and adjustable calf rest. My toddler and baby are both comfortable in it, and the high-end finishes make it feel worth the splurge. Still, it\u2019s heavier than other models and lifting it while holding a baby takes effort.",
      "Nuna TRVL dubl Stroller",
      "Perfect for families with two stroller-aged kids. The narrow frame fits through standard doors and the fold is quick and easy. Both seats recline independently, and the canopies provide solid coverage. The biggest drawback? There\u2019s no way to add a third seat or board once baby number three arrives.",
      "Babyzen YOYO2 Stroller",
      "My most traveled stroller. It\u2019s been to Europe, Florida and back. It folds in a flash, fits in plane bins and handles tight city spaces with ease. I love that it transitions from newborn bassinet to toddler seat and can connect with another YOYO for a double setup. But between the limited storage, smaller canopy and the steep price (especially with accessories), it\u2019s definitely an investment.",
      "Valco Trend Duo Side by Side Double Stroller",
      "If you want a double stroller without pushing a tank, this is it. Each seat has plenty of space and coverage, and the ride is smoother than expected even over uneven ground. I can fit two diaper bags in the under-basket. The downside? The fold requires both hands, and it\u2019s too bulky for plane travel or tight entryways.",
      "Cybex Libelle 2 Stroller",
      "This is your \u201ckeep it in the trunk\u201d stroller. It folds down to almost nothing and is perfect for errands or quick trips. It can handle a baby and even a toddler for short rides, and it\u2019s car seat-compatible. Just don\u2019t expect it to conquer cobblestones or hold up to long walks.",
      "Zoe The Traveler",
      "This 13-lb stroller is surprisingly durable. It folds with one hand, the canopy provides solid shade and the magnetic harness makes buckling quick and painless. The leatherette accents give it a high-end feel without the high-end price. For all-day outings, though, I\u2019d recommend adding a seat liner for extra comfort and prepping for a slightly more involved cleanup routine.",
      "Guava Roam Stroller",
      "Think SUV in stroller form. The Guava Roam has a three-wheel design with extra large tires (14-inch rear, 12-inch front) that handle bumps, uneven sidewalks and grass effortlessly \u2014 it\u2019s ideal for joggers or anyone constantly on the move. The padded seat is comfortable for my baby even on long days out, and the deep storage means I don\u2019t need to carry an extra bag.",
      "NBC Select tech reporter Harry Rabinowitz also tested this stroller, and he found it perfectly met his need for a running stroller than folded compactly enough to fit through small doors and vestibules. \u201cWhile I haven\u2019t tested as many strollers as Becca, the Roam was the only stroller that checked all my boxes: safe for running and everyday use, a compact fold, a one-handed carry handle and ample underseat storage,\u201d he says. \u201cNow I can\u2019t imagine my routine without it.\u201d",
      "Downside are the brake can be tricky to engage and the stroller is too large to be overhead-bin friendly.",

Shoe stores usually have specialty tools and an informed staff that can help you identify and consider things like your foot shape, arch type and gait. Some stores can even perform a treadmill analysis of your walk.",

      "Frequently asked questions",
      "Experts recommend replacing most types of sneakers every 300 to 500 miles, including walking shoes. Make a note of when you buy a new pair, and put a reminder for yourself every six months or so to consider your mileage.",
      "There are three types of arches: flat, neutral and high, says Dr. Olga Shvets, a podiatrist at Central Park Podiatry. You can learn more in our full story about how to identify your arch type.",
      "Shvets finds that people with flat feet do well in neutral (or pronator) shoes. She also recommends an insert to help the shoe fit in a more neutral manner. Anyone with a high arch may benefit from a high lacing shoe to keep the ankle stable, as well as inserts like orthotics.",
      "The best way to get a precise determination of your foot type is to consult a podiatrist, especially if you are experiencing foot pains and discomfort, says Cunha.",
      "Meet our experts",

      "For me, I think what was fun about the social media aspect is, a lot of who I am as a person is also in Anton. So it was really fun to even just post something that Owen would post and people would be like, \u201cThis is so Anton.\u201d I was like, is that a compliment? Are you roasting me, or are you being super nice?",
      "People have really taken to the Anton and Paul Baker plot line, which I think is so beautiful. It\u2019s so cheesy to say this but it really makes me feel like, \u201cOh, people love, love. Love wins.\u201d",
      "Also, it\u2019s so fun to tease because I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen in the next season. On my own TikTok, I\u2019m like, \u201cWell, what if this happened?\u201d Then I see the reaction and I\u2019m like, \u201cOK, that can\u2019t happen because everyone hated that TikTok.\u201d I feel like the creators, too, are learning from the way that we have our own special communication with the people watching it. And it feels like we\u2019re just all in a friend group. They\u2019re like, \u201cWait, Issa (Amita Rao) needs a girlfriend in Season 2!\u201d And (creators) Ben (Kronengold) and Rebecca (Shaw) are so brilliant, I feel like they will hear that and take the people watching opinions, because it matters.",
      "Does your phone look like Anton's?",
      "So this is what happened. I'm just gonna tell you it straight. (Laughs). So Episode 1, the pilot, when I auditioned, Anton was struggling with dating as he is in the season, but he was a little more emotionally reserved and a little more cutting. Then as we built this character together, they kind of infused a little bit of my people-pleasing aspects into Anton. So then it became a mix of what they had brilliantly written before, and also a little bit of Owen as well \u2014 I just used my name in the third person ... I cannot believe I just did it.",
      "But yeah, they infuse Anton with me. For instance, the phone episode is very me to the point where I was like, we might as well just use my real phone. We didn\u2019t, thank God. But yes, if you look at my phone, it\u2019s like, \u201cCar Accident No. 4,\u201d like, \u201cGray Socks Guy From Bar.\u201d",
      "Right now I have probably 2,000 unread text messages. But I would like to say that my mother is worse than me and meets people on the street and puts me in group chats with random people. So that's why I have so many unread texts, because my mom will go to a 7-Eleven, meet someone and put me in a group chat with this person and all of his family.",
      "\"Adults\" opens with Issa's boyfriend, the Canadian, sexually fluid Paul Baker (Jack Innanen), moving into the house. He and Anton strike up a close friendship. In the season's finale, Paul Baker learns his visa's expiring, so Issa proposes. After she gets cold feet, their other housemates Samir (Malik Elassal) and Billie (Lucy Freyer) also offer to marry him.",
      "The final scene reveals that Paul Baker and Anton got married. At their roommates' urging, they share a kiss that turns more than platonic. But before anyone can react, the power goes out.",
      "I want to talk about the ending. At the civil wedding ceremony, did Anton volunteer to marry Paul Baker, or did Paul Baker ask Anton to marry him at that moment?",
      "I don't know why, I just got a full chill down my spine. I felt like Anton in this moment.",
      "I probably think, based on who Anton is \u2014 a little more emotionally reserved, emotionally stunted and scared of love \u2014\u00a0I don't think he volunteered. But I think he was so beyond happy when he was asked. That's what I would say.",
      "What has your experience been diving into this fandom?",
      "We'll do anything to make people watch the show. We love it so much that we're like, we will literally read fan fiction if you just turn on the TV. It's been amazing because it feels like everyone watching it and everyone interacting with us online are loving these characters and the stories as much as we did when we were making it. It feels like we\u2019re a little community of people... a group of people that I would get along with.",
      "I love reading all of people\u2019s theories about Paul Baker and Anton, or Samir and Billie, or what Issa is going to do. I\u2019ve never been on a television show that has that. I feel so lucky to be a part of it because I\u2019ve been on the other end for so many shows like that, where I was secretly on my finsta (\u201cfake Instagram,\u201d or a secondary social media account), writing comments about what would happen in the next season of whatever show I\u2019m talking about.",
      "So you were a fan of ship culture?",
      "I love ship culture. (Laughs). I love it. \u201cNew Girl\u201d was a big one for me. Nick and Jess, I was shipping. There\u2019s been so many. I remember re-watching \u201cFriends\u201d during COVID. And I was like, \u201cOh my God. I love Rachel and Ross.\u201d I love a sitcom ship, I really do.",
      "After that kiss, after they deal with the power going out, what happens next?",
      "Here's my theory, and I've never really said this, and maybe I'll get absolutely killed for saying it, but I think they're all going to make it through.",
      "I think Issa and Anton have such a beautiful friendship, and Amita and I actually have mimicked that in real life. We actually are the best of friends. She's gonna be a bridesmaid in my wedding, like, that's the kind of friend she's become to me. So I do feel like, if that happened in real life with Amita and I, we would make it through. I probably wouldn't do it, but we would make it through. So I think everything's gonna be OK, but I do think, of course, there will be some hiccups.",
      "We know Paul Baker has expressed that he thinks Anton's 'the coolest person in the world.' How does Anton view Paul Baker?",
      "I think Anton has finally found someone who he connects to on a level that he's been searching for. But it is just so scary that that person is your best friend's boyfriend.",
      "So I think either this will change him for the better. Maybe he will be more vocal about his feelings, or this will set him back 20 more years. He will never say anything again. Let's hope for the first.",
      "While releasing \u201cOvercompensating\u201d and \u201cAdults,\u201d Thiele has also been working on his own show, \u201cOff Color,\u201d about his relationship with his parents, who adopted him. The show includes executive producer Ilana Glazer.",
      "Per The Hollywood Reporter, the logline reads, \u201cHe\u2019s gay and Black, they\u2019re all Jewish, his mom should be on \u2018Real Housewives\u2019 and his cousin\u2019s a former party girl turned Rabbi-in-training. The comedy is about a son who doesn\u2019t want to grow up, a mother who has no intention of letting him, and a dad who\u2019s probably faking a nap in the other room so he doesn\u2019t have to engage.\u201d",
      "How is the development of 'Off Color' going?",
      "We are chugging along. Our little team, all these people that I\u2019ve looked up to for so long; Kent Alterman and Sarah Babineau were the heads of Comedy Central who greenlit my favorite shows ever, \u201cBroad City\u201d included. And then Ilana, who is a comedy legend and one of my deepest and biggest role models. So it kind of feels crazy to just even work with them.",
      "So we're chugging along, and hopefully something will happen soon.",
      "Thinking of the premise of 'Off Color,' how do you approach putting yourself into a role? Is it natural for you?",
      "Yeah, it is natural \u2014 because I\u2019m such a narcissist. No, no, but it is natural. What\u2019s so funny about writing about my family is that my family is so beautifully insane. I\u2019ll write something and Ilana will read it and be like, \u201cOh, this could not happen.\u201d And I said, \u201cNo, no, it just happened two minutes ago, which is why I\u2019m texting you. ... My mother really did this in the grocery store.\u201d",
      "That's why it's so fun, because it feels like family therapy. It feels like I'm journaling about the craziest things that my parents could do. But somehow it's all real."

      "\u201cBeli and I connected early on,\u201d M\u00e9ndez, who stars in and executive produced the show, tells TODAY.com.",
      "Prior to working together on \u201cMentiras,\u201d which translates to \u201cLies,\u201d they co-starred in another Prime Video drama, \u201c\u00bfQui\u00e9n Lo Mat\u00f3?\u201d or \u201cWho Killed Him?\u201d",

      "Set in the \u201880s, the eight-episode series centers around four women \u2014 Daniela (Belinda), Dulce (Diana Bovio), Yuri (Regina Bland\u00f3n) and Lupita (Mariana Trevi\u00f1o) \u2014 who are all connected to the recently murdered Emmanuel Mijares (M\u00e9ndez). After they are summoned to a mysterious mansion, two discover that they were married to him, while the other two have secrets of their own when it comes to Emmanuel. Additional twists and hilarious turns ensue.",

The musical's \u2014 and now the show\u2019s \u2014 success stems from the incorporation of hit Spanish pop music of the \u201880s, the likes of Amanda Miguel\u2019s \u201c\u00c9l Me Minti\u00f3\u201d and Daniela Romo\u2019s \u201cMentiras.\u201d After the series was released June 13, the soundtrack debuted on Spotify\u2019s Top 10 albums worldwide list, and at a July 10 screening, M\u00e9ndez and Belinda were surprised with plaques celebrating 100 million streams.",
      "Adding an extra element of nostalgia for viewers, the characters\u2019 names are inspired by iconic Mexican singers Dulce, Emmanuel, Mijares, Daniela Romo, Yuri and Lupita D\u2019Alessio.",

      "By 2015, the two would co-star in the hit Netflix series \u201cClub de Cuervos,\u201d delighting audiences with their exaggerated and over-the-top performances as wealthy, arrogant siblings fighting over their father's soccer team.",
      "Since the show ended in 2019, fans have been longing for a reunion \u2014 and this was it.",
      "Chatting with TODAY.com, M\u00e9ndez and Belinda spoke about the incredible production, the challenges of securing the rights to the popular songs, re-creating those hits while staying true to the original material and more.",
      "This interview has been edited for clarity and translated from Spanish to English.",
      "Luis, did you hand pick the cast for this show?",
      "Luis Gerardo M\u00e9ndez: Oh, yeah. What was most important was the adaptation, which was very complicated and took about four years. To create the scripts, we first needed the rights to the songs \u2014 and they were the most popular Spanish songs of the \u201880s, which was tough.",
      "But when it came to the casting, I knew I couldn\u2019t do it without Mariana Trevi\u00f1o, who played Lupita in the original musical. She wasn\u2019t sure about returning to the role and opening Pandora\u2019s box again (but she did). And the other person we always wanted was Belinda.",
      "I found out we were working together on \u201c\u00bfQui\u00e9n Lo Mat\u00f3?\u201d and I feel like we instantly connected. There\u2019s people you meet and you just know who they are, what they\u2019ve been through, what their goals are, what they like, what they don\u2019t \u2014 and that\u2019s what I felt (with Belinda).",
      "Belinda, you've been acting since you were a child but have been focusing on your music career. How do you choose which acting projects to take on?",
      "Belinda: The truth is, I have been sent a lot of scripts and been invited to be part of a lot of movies and shows. But I am very picky. I\u2019m very specific in what I decide to take on.",
      "But I loved \u201cMentiras\u201d because it was a great challenge for me, not only as an actor, because this character has a wide range, but because it\u2019s just me in a room with three incredible actresses and Luis Gerardo.",
      "Luis Gerardo M\u00e9ndez: She was holding her own alongside Mariana Trevi\u00f1o, Regina Bland\u00f3n and Diana Bovio, who are masters of comedy. I think the great surprise was that Beli is not only an extraordinary singer and actor, which we knew, but she\u2019s very funny and she can do comedy very well.",
      "One thing that has done very well is the soundtrack. People have been obsessed with it.",
      "Luis Gerardo M\u00e9ndez: Not even in my wildest dreams did I imagine it would turn out so good, but it did. It\u2019s been crazy. The songs have millions of streams on Spotify.",
      "We had a feeling that it was going to work out but the response has been very overwhelming and kind, and we are very grateful because no one imagined it.",
      "Was there ever any pressure to re-create these iconic songs?",
      "Luis Gerardo M\u00e9ndez: I never thought about that. I never thought about being nervous or needing to be at the same level as (singers) Mijares or Emmanuel, because I knew I was never going to be them.",
      "These characters are singing about something very specific that they are going through at that moment. The great thing about \"Mentiras\" is the characters don't sing just to sing. The characters sing so that the story advances. When the character can't express what they are feeling with words, they start to sing. So it\u2019s not me singing like Mijares, it\u2019s me singing as my character Emmanuel. It\u2019s not Belinda singing like Amanda Miguel, it\u2019s Belinda singing as Daniela. And Belinda did brilliant things with her songs, like \u201cDe Color De Rosa.\u201d",
      "Was it always the plan to make the show look like a play and not like a television show?",
      "Luis Gerardo M\u00e9ndez: We always want to pay homage to theater and wanted it to feel very theatrical. The references we had when creating the show were \u201cMoulin Rouge,\u201d \u201cLa La Land\u201d and even \u201cBarbie.\u201d",
      "But we also didn't want it to be like we just filmed the original musical. We wanted to have that essence, though. Antonio Mu\u00f1o-Hierro, the production designer, had this brilliant idea. He said, \u201cWhat\u2019s the series called? It\u2019s called \u2018Mentiras\u2019 (\u2018Lies\u2019)\u2019. So let\u2019s show viewers that everything is a lie. That the sets are also fake.\u2019\u201d",
      "And that\u2019s why there\u2019s these moments when (surprise guest) Daniela Romo says, \u201cEverything is a lie,\u201d and pushes the house down and you see that you\u2019re in the Mijares household, but behind that is Daniela\u2019s house. For me, that was beautiful. I grew up in the world of musical theater, and it\u2019s a love letter to theater, and that\u2019s what makes it so visually stunning.",
      "Belinda: It's incredibly well made. It had a large budget for the sets, everything in general was well-designed, the aesthetic, cinematography, every detail was outstanding.",
      "I think it will set a precedent, and people will be like, \u201cLet\u2019s make a series like \u2018Mentiras.\u2019\u201d It will be the example for many other people, and that\u2019s what\u2019s incredible."

      "\u201cI can\u2019t give you any more than I have,\" Carrie said. \"And it wasn\u2019t enough. And there's all the family stuff. I'm sorry but there is.\"",

      "\"I remember reading press last season when we got them back together \u2014 not even press, but buzz, scanning social media comments. So many people were like, She better not hurt him again, or How is she going to hurt him?\" Zuritsky said.",
      "\"That was always ringing in my ears as a challenge,\" she added.",
      "Being aware ahead of time that Carrie and Aidan \"probably\" wouldn't last in \"AJLT\" forced the duo to wonder, \"How can we undo it in a way that left both of them with their dignity, their integrity, their love \u2014 and no one betrays anyone?\"",

      "Known as the \u201cNicki Minaj challenge,\u201d this viral moment is an elaborate balancing act. The challenge has taken over the internet, as the hashtag #nickiminajchallenge has been used over 115,000 times on TikTok alone.",
      "Creators have balanced on everything from Jenga blocks to soup cans. Many have found their own humorous, if not outrageous, ways to embrace the challenge and make it their own. Some have ridden on their kids' play cars while remaining in the pose, while others have used their pets to get in on the action.",
      "As the trend grows in popularity, some are wondering how it all started, and is it safe? Here\u2019s what you need to know about the Nicki Minaj challenge.",
      "Where Did the Nicki Minaj Challenge Come From?",
      "The trend is inspired by rapper Nicki Minaj\u2019s famous pose in the music video for the 2013 song \u201cHigh School\u201d ft. Lil Wayne. At the video\u2019s 34 second mark, Minaj stands by a swimming pool in stilettos, crouching low to the ground with one leg crossed over the other.",
      "In April, TikTok user @1jacore posted a video attempting to emulate Minaj. Since then, others followed suit, with many getting creative as they tried to channel the singer's impressive posture.",
      "Now, the trend has evolved beyond just completing Minaj\u2019s original pose. Users have taken the challenge to new heights, balancing on as many objects as possible, all while wearing a pair of high heels. The trend also appears to have become somewhat competitive, with some participants seemingly attempting to outdo one another with the most elaborate balancing act.",
      "For example, one user posted a video of herself on TikTok balancing on a tall stack of tables in her garden. In the video, she holds a hose in one hand and balances on an upside down flowerpot while in a pair of heels.",
      "Users have also recorded themselves balancing on champagne bottles, cakes and weights.",
      "On TODAY with Jenna & Friends July 24, Jenna Bush Hager and Willie Geist both attempted the trend. Jenna completed the pose on a stack of books with her July book club pick in hand and a pair of sunglasses on. Willie fulfilled the challenge by balancing on top of ceramic coffee mugs with a margarita in hand.",
      "Some attempts at the trend seem to defy physics and gravity. But as participants try to create the craziest take on the trend yet, they should also consider the safety implications behind completing such a stunt.",
      "Is the Nicki Minaj Challenge Safe?",
      "TODAY fitness contributor Stephanie Mansour tells TODAY.com that the Nicki Minaj challenge can be unsafe if the proper precautions are not taken.",
      "\u201cI never recommend working out in heels or balancing on one foot in heels, unless wearing them is part of the artistic nature of a workout,\u201d Mansour says.",
      "Balancing on unstable objects is risky, she adds. If the proper precautions are not taken, this challenge could be \u201cvery dangerous.\u201d",
      "While the challenge is still sweeping social media, Mansour offers her sobering take on whether fans should try to take it on.",
      "\u201cI hate to be the bearer of bad news over a fun TikTok trend,\u201d Mansour says, \u201cbut I really don\u2019t recommend that anyone seriously try this.\u201d",
      "How to Safely do the Nicki Minaj Challenge",
      "Even though the Nicki Minaj challenge is not \"recommended,\" there's still hope for those who want to join in on the fun. There are ways to safely complete the challenge and doing it might even have some benefits.",
      "Mansour says balancing workouts can be a great exercise to build strength.",
      "\u201cThis could be a great exercise to strengthen your glutes, hamstrings, quads, calf and the stabilizing muscles, tendons and ligaments surrounding your ankle, knee and hip joints,\u201d Mansour says, referring to the challenge.",
      "To complete the trend safely, Mansour recommends balancing on a stable surface, such as a level stack of books. She also says participants should make sure that what they are balancing on is wide enough, which will help them from tipping over.",
      "She says it also would be helpful to have past experience balancing on one foot on surfaces that are not elevated.",
      "After you have the right surface to balance on, and wear a pair of workout shoes, your risk of injury is lower.",
      "Now, all that's left for you to do is bring your own personality to the trend and see what creative items you can grab to feature in your pose."

      "The film breezes past the characters\u2019 origin stories, showing in flashbacks how their previous trip to space resulted in them returning to Earth with superpowers. But the beloved heroes of this world are rattled when one day the Silver Surfer, played by Julia Garner, descends from the sky and announces to the quartet, and the world, that their planet is marked for death.

He reveals that Franklin has special abilities that would eliminate the giant\u2019s insatiable hunger, even though Reed\u2019s multiple tests appeared to confirm the baby lacked superpowers.",
      "Instead of giving into Galactus\u2019 demand, the quartet outsmart him by luring the entity into a trap. However, the plan goes awry and Sue has to use all her strength to create a force field strong enough to push Galactus into a portal that sends him to a far part of the galaxy.",

      "The Tony winner later described Payne as being \u201cin a great place\u201d when they filmed the show, noting that the panel of judges \u201cgelled so well.\u201d",

      "The nationalist slogan helped the right-wing populist party Sanseito make big gains in Japan\u2019s parliamentary elections on Sunday, as it capitalized on economic malaise and concerns about immigration and overtourism.",
      "Party leader Sohei Kamiya, who since 2022 had held Sanseito\u2019s only seat in the upper house of Japan\u2019s parliament, will now be joined by 14 others in the 248-seat chamber. It\u2019s a far cry from the party\u2019s origin as a fringe anti-vaccination group on YouTube during the Covid-19 pandemic.",
      "Though Japan has long had a complex relationship with foreigners and its cultural identity, experts say Sanseito\u2019s rise is another indication of the global shift to the right embodied and partly fueled by Trump, with populist figures gaining ground in Europe, Britain, Latin America and elsewhere.",
      "Kamiya \u201cfancies himself a mini-Trump\u201d and \u201cis one of those who Trump has put wind in his sails,\u201d said Jeff Kingston, a professor of Asian studies and history at Temple University\u2019s Japan campus.",
      "Speaking at a rally on Saturday at Tokyo\u2019s Shiba Park, Kamiya said his calls for greater restrictions on foreign workers and investment were driven not by xenophobia but by \u201cthe workings of globalization.\u201d He criticized mainstream parties\u2019 support for boosting immigration in an effort to address the labor shortage facing Japan\u2019s aging and shrinking population.",
      "\u201cJapan is still the fourth-largest economy in the world. We have 120 million people. Why do we have to rely on foreign capital?\u201d Kamiya told an enthusiastic crowd.",

      "With voters concerned about stagnating wages, surging prices and bleak employment prospects, \u201cthe change-makers got a lot of protest votes from people who feel disenfranchised,\u201d he said.",
      "Sanseito\u2019s platform resonated with voters such as Yuta Kato.",
      "\u201cThe number of [foreign immigrants] who don\u2019t obey rules is increasing. People don\u2019t voice it, but I think they feel that,\u201d the 38-year-old hairdresser told Reuters in Tokyo. \u201cAlso, the burden on citizens including taxes is getting bigger and bigger, so life is getting more difficult.\u201d",
      "The biggest reason Sanseito did well in the election, he said, \u201cis that they are speaking on behalf of us.\u201d",
      "Kamiya\u2019s party was not the only upstart to benefit from voter discontent, with the center-right Democratic Party for the People increasing its number of seats in the upper house from five to 16.",
      "Sanseito, whose name means \u201cParticipate in Politics,\u201d originated in 2020 amid the Covid-19 pandemic, attracting conservatives with YouTube videos promoting conspiracy theories about vaccines and pushing back against mask mandates. Its YouTube channel now has almost 480,000 subscribers.",
      "The party has also warned about a \u201csilent invasion\u201d of foreigners in Japan, where the number of foreign residents rose more than 10% last year to a record of almost 3.8 million, according to the Immigration Services Agency. It remains far lower as a proportion of the population than in the U.S. or Europe, however.",
      "Critics say such rhetoric has fueled hate speech and growing hostility toward foreigners in Japan, citing a survey last month by Japanese broadcaster NHK and others in which almost two-thirds of respondents agreed that foreigners received \u201cpreferential treatment.\u201d",
      "At the Sanseito rally on Saturday, protesters held up signs that said \u201cNo Hate\u201d and \u201cRacists Go Home.\u201d",

      "\u201cWe have no intention of discriminating against foreigners, nor do we have any intention of inciting division,\u201d he said Monday. \u201cWe\u2019re just aiming to firmly rebuild the lives of Japanese people who are currently in trouble.\u201d",
      "Despite its electoral advances, Sanseito doesn\u2019t have enough members in the upper house to make much impact on its own and has only three seats in the more powerful lower house. The challenge, Kingston said, is whether Kamiya can \u201ctake this anger, the malaise, and bring his show nationwide.\u201d"

      "The U.N. World Food Program says nearly a quarter of Gaza\u2019s 2.1 million Palestinians face famine-like conditions, thousands are suffering acute malnutrition, and the World Health Organization and doctors in the enclave report starvation deaths of children and others.",
      "The U.N. also estimates that Israeli forces have killed more than 1,000 people seeking food supplies, the majority near the militarized distribution sites of the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), the new private aid group that uses a for-profit U.S. logistics firm run by a former CIA officer and armed U.S. military veterans.",
      "The study was conducted by the Bureau of Humanitarian Assistance (BHA) of USAID, which was the largest funder of assistance to Gaza before the Trump administration froze all U.S. foreign aid in January, terminating thousands of programs. It has also begun dismantling USAID, whose functions have been folded into the State Department.",
      "The analysis found that at least 44 of the 156 incidents where aid supplies were reported stolen or lost were \u201ceither directly or indirectly\u201d due to Israeli military actions, according to the briefing slides.",
      "Israel\u2019s military did not respond to questions about those findings.",
      "The study noted a limitation: because Palestinians who receive aid cannot be vetted, it was possible that U.S.-funded supplies went to administrative officials of Hamas, the Islamist rulers of Gaza.",
      "One source familiar with the study also cautioned that the absence of reports of widespread aid diversion by Hamas \u201cdoes not mean that diversion has not occurred.\u201d",
      "The war in Gaza began after Hamas attacked Israel in October 2023, killing 1,200 people and capturing 251 hostages, according to Israeli tallies. Nearly 60,000 Palestinians have been killed since the Israeli assault began, according to Palestinian health officials.",
      "Israel says Hamas diverts aid",
      "Israel, which controls access to Gaza, has said that Hamas steals food supplies from U.N. and other organizations to use to control the civilian population and boost its finances, including by jacking up the prices of the goods and reselling them to civilians.",
      "Asked about the USAID report, the Israeli military told Reuters that its allegations are based on intelligence reports that Hamas militants seized cargoes by \u201cboth covertly and overtly\u201d embedding themselves on aid trucks.",
      "Those reports also show that Hamas has diverted up to 25% of aid supplies to its fighters or sold them to civilians, the Israeli military said, adding that GHF has ended the militants\u2019 control of aid by distributing it directly to civilians.",
      "Hamas denies the allegations. A Hamas security official said that Israel has killed more than 800 Hamas-affiliated police and security guards trying to protect aid vehicles and convoy routes. Their missions were coordinated with the U.N.",
      "Reuters could not independently verify the claims by Hamas and Israel, which has not made public proof that the militants have systematically stolen aid.",
      "GHF also accuses Hamas of massive aid theft in defending its distribution model. The U.N. and other groups have rejected calls by GHF, Israel and the U.S. to cooperate with the foundation, saying it violates international humanitarian principles of neutrality.",
      "In response to a request for comment, GHF referred Reuters to a July 2 Washington Post article that quoted an unidentified Gazan and anonymous Israeli officials as saying Hamas profited from the sales and taxing of pilfered humanitarian aid.",
      "Aid groups required to report losses",
      "The 156 reports of theft or losses of supplies reviewed by BHA were filed by U.N. agencies and other humanitarian groups working in Gaza as a condition of receiving U.S. aid funds.",
      "The second source familiar with the matter said that after receiving reports of U.S.-funded aid thefts or losses, USAID staff followed up with partner organizations to try to determine if there was Hamas involvement.",
      "Those organizations also would \u201credirect or pause\u201d aid distributions if they learned that Hamas was in the vicinity, the source said.",
      "Aid organizations working in Gaza also are required to vet their personnel, sub-contractors and suppliers for ties to extremist groups before receiving U.S. funds, a condition that the State Department waived in approving $30 million for GHF last month.",
      "The slide presentation noted that USAID partners tended to over-report aid diversion and theft by groups sanctioned or designated by the U.S. as foreign terrorist organizations \u2014 such as Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad \u2014 because they want to avoid losing U.S. funding.",
      "Of the 156 incidents of loss or theft reported, 63 were attributed to unknown perpetrators, 35 to armed actors, 25 to unarmed people, 11 directly to Israeli military action, 11 to corrupt subcontractors, five to aid group personnel \u201cengaging in corrupt activities,\u201d and six to \u201cothers,\u201d a category that accounted for \u201ccommodities stolen in unknown circumstances,\u201d according to the slide presentation.",
      "The armed actors \u201cincluded gangs and other miscellaneous individuals who may have had weapons,\u201d said a slide. Another slide said \u201ca review of all 156 incidents found no affiliations with\u201d U.S.-designated foreign terrorist organizations, of which Hamas is one.",
      "\u201cThe majority of incidents could not be definitively attributed to a specific actor,\u201d said another slide. \u201cPartners often largely discovered the commodities had been stolen in transit without identifying the perpetrator.\u201d",
      "It is possible there were classified intelligence reports on Hamas aid thefts, but BHA staff lost access to classified systems in the dismantlement of USAID, said a slide.",
      "However, a source familiar with U.S. intelligence assessments told Reuters that they knew of no U.S. intelligence reports detailing Hamas aid diversions and that Washington was relying on Israeli reports.",
      "The BHA analysis found that the Israeli military \u201cdirectly or indirectly caused\u201d a total of 44 incidents in which U.S.-funded aid was lost or stolen. Those included the 11 attributed to direct Israeli military actions, such as airstrikes or orders to Palestinians to evacuate areas of the war-torn enclave.",
      "Losses indirectly attributed to Israeli military included cases where they compelled aid groups to use delivery routes with high risks of theft or looting, ignoring requests for alternative routes, the analysis said."

Doctors, aid groups and Palestinians say the long-running hunger crisis has reached a tipping point, with deaths from malnutrition surging.",

      "Citing new data from Gaza's health ministry, the UNFPA found that the number of babies born in Gaza had sharply declined in the first six months of the year, dropping by 41% \u2014 from 29,000 births in the same period in 2022 to 17,000.",
      "Many of the newborns are in a state of crisis. At least 20 babies have died within 24 hours of birth, UNFPA said, while 33% were born prematurely, underweight or required admission to neonatal intensive care.",

      "Barbakh, who was displaced from her home in Khan Younis and now lives in a cramped tent with six other family members, said food in Gaza has become extremely scarce, and what little is available in the markets is exorbitantly expensive.",
      "\u201cA single can of formula milk costs 170 shekels ($51), and I cannot afford it for my daughter,\u201d she said.",
      "Another of the malnourished babies in Nasser Hospital was 5-month-old Ramaa, wearing a pink floral dress that crumpled around her slight frame.",

      "Until about two months ago, Waleed Abou Aia said Ramaa \u201cwas nursing naturally, but I am suffering from malnutrition due to a lack of food and water, so the child became malnourished.\u201d",
      "Walking through the ward, Elidalis Burgos, an American critical care nurse volunteering at Nasser Hospital, visited several babies and children. One boy in an orange shirt lay in a cot, his limbs and face bandaged after he was injured from a strike that killed his family. A month later, the angles of his bones were visible under his thin skin.",
      "\u201cHe's suffering from a lot of wounds and severe malnutrition,\u201d Burgos said, \u201cas the blockade has not allowed any nutrition for anybody. Without that, it will be very difficult for a good prognosis.\u201d",

      "But around 13 million years ago, one of them may have fallen prey to an even larger creature, a team of paleontologists in Colombia have discovered after examining bite marks in a fossilized bone of one of the fearsome birds.",
      "Publishing their findings in the peer-reviewed scientific journal \u201cBiology Letters,\u201d the team hypothesized that it was killed and eaten or consumed through scavenging by a medium sized caiman, a crocodile-like reptile.",
      "\u201cThis is a fascinating story of the interaction of two very iconic animals in the past,\u201d Andr\u00e9s Link, the study\u2019s lead author, told NBC News in an email Wednesday. \u201cWe actually found not only the first record of a terror bird in northern south America, but the tooth marks of a large caiman that has probably fed on it,\u201d he added.",
      "Terror bird fossils, which are rare, have mostly been identified in the southern part of the continent.",
      "While tooth marks are \u201cnot uncommon\u201d in the fossil record, it\u2019s \u201cexciting\u201d to find evidence that indicates an apex predator being hunted or scavenged by another, said Link, an associate professor of  biological sciences at the Los Andes University in Colombia.",
      "Writing in \u201cBiology Letters,\u201d the team said the teeth marks showed no signs of healing, suggesting that the attack was fatal.",
      "Based on the finding, they added that terror birds might have faced higher risk of being killed and eaten than previously expected.",
      "To identify the attacker, Link and his team scanned the fossil and analyzed the size, shape and spacing of the tooth marks. After comparing those marks with teeth of crocodyliforms from the region, they concluded that the trace maker was likely a juvenile caiman about 15 feet long.",
      "It remains \u201cvery difficult\u201d to know if the caiman ate the terror bird after killing it or whether it scavenged the carcass, Link said. If the bird was alive, it was likely attacked while drinking at a river, researchers wrote, and conversely, if it was dead, the caiman found and fed on its body near water.",
      "\u201cThis story will not be told completely as we have no further evidence to choose between these two hypotheses.\u201d Link said.",

      "Avdic said he heard shots, felt sharp pain in his right side and right arm and blacked out. When he woke up, more prisoners were being lined up for execution. When the small truck that brought him to the site drove away, Avdic and another wounded man escaped in the darkness. After walking through the woods for days, they crossed into Muslim-controlled central Bosnia.",
      "Last week, Avdic recounted his experience to members of the German parliament at an event in Berlin marking the 30th anniversary of the fall of the United Nations-protected \u201csafe area\u201d of Srebrenica. Two international courts have ruled that Bosnian Serbs\u2019 systematic killing of male Bosnian Muslim prisoners \u2014 at least 7,000 in total \u2014 was the first genocide in Europe since World War II.",

      "A second AfD member, Martin Sichert, invoked a conspiracy theory, warning that Muslims were waging a \u201cbirth jihad\u201d in Germany, a reference to Muslim immigrants someday outnumbering Germans. \u201cSrebrenica reminds us to end multiculturalism before it\u2019s too late,\u201d Sichert warned.",
      "As disinformation spreads online, denialism about war crimes \u2014 both past and ongoing \u2014 is growing increasingly common worldwide, experts warn. From current conflicts in Ukraine, Israel and Gaza to past atrocities in Syria, Bosnia and Rwanda, as well as the Holocaust, basic facts are now disputed or dismissed.",
      "Denialism is proving politically profitable, as well. In February, the AfD won the second-most seats in Germany\u2019s parliament, the best showing by a far-right party since World War II. In Bosnia, a local Serb leader, Milorad Dodik, has gained support by spreading conspiracy theories about Srebrenica, calling it \u201can arranged tragedy.\u201d He dismisses the identification of 6,981 victims \u2014 part of the largest DNA identification project in history\u2014 as a hoax.",

      "At a conference in Srebrenica marking the 30th anniversary of the mass killings here, the heads of the Kigali Genocide Memorial in Rwanda and the Auschwitz-Birkenau and Stutthof concentration camp museums in Poland warned that spreading lies online about war crimes has also become financially profitable.",

After the fall of Srebrenica, rumors spread that Bosnian Muslim men were describing mass executions. Avdic, then a shell-shocked teenager whose father was later found in a mass grave, was one of nine men who told me they had survived mass executions. When I later visited the gravel plateau beside an earthen dam in the village of Petkovci, I found two human femurs.",

The surrounded town had been declared an internationally protected \u201csafe area,\u201d but the United States, Europe and 600 Dutch U.N. peacekeepers did little to protect it",
      "Women, children and elderly men took refuge at a large battery factory that Dutch peacekeepers had turned into their main base. And men, most of them unarmed, set off through the woods on a 60-mile trek to Muslim-controlled central Bosnia.",
      "When Serb forces attacked the column, Avdic and his father were separated in the chaos. \u201cI lost him,\u201d Avdic recalled. \u201cI lost him immediately.\u201d He continued walking with strangers but was eventually captured. Two days later, he and other men were taken to the gravel plateau, and the executions began.",
      "Needing to speak",
      "For the next 12 years, Avdic testified at war crimes trials about the executions under a pseudonym and lived far from Srebrenica, fearing for his safety. In 2007, he returned to Srebrenica, his hometown. He and other Bosnian Muslims felt a duty to return to the area and preserve its Muslim community. Avdic, who had grown up in a village outside the town and also lost four uncles and three cousins in the killings, found being in Srebrenica comforting.",
      "\u201cI have less nightmares,\u201d he said, shrugging his shoulders. \u201cI cannot explain it.\u201d",
      "In 2014, when he visited the execution site during an event with mothers of the victims, he was filled with a desire to speak publicly about the mass killing he survived.",
      "\u201cWhen I came to the place, something forced me to say something; I felt a strong need to talk,\u201d he said. \u201cWords started to flow, something stronger than me.\u201d",
      "He met his wife, Elvisa, a Bosnian Muslim survivor whose uncle and cousin also died in the executions, in Srebrenica in 2008. The following year, they married. Now, Nedzad works as a manager at a company in Srebrenica that produces parts for luxury car interiors. Elvisa works at a local meteorological station. They have three daughters who attend local school alongside Serb children. Serbs and Muslims coexist but generally don\u2019t discuss the war.",
      "\u201cHatred destroys, first of all, those who hate,\u201d Avdic said.",
      "In recent years, Avdic has given dozens of speeches about the massacres in multiple countries and called for the protection of civilians in Ukraine and Syria. Speaking about Srebrenica is difficult but cathartic. \u201cIt was my choice to go to Berlin,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is not something that I wish. It is emotional, and it is difficult for me.\u201d",
      "Local Bosnian Muslims have transformed the cavernous former car battery factory that Dutch U.N. peacekeepers used as a base into a museum documenting the genocide. Across the street, the headstones of the thousands of Muslim men and boys killed in the massacres cover a lush green field and hillside.",
      "In recent years, though, Muslims have slowly left Srebrenica, many of them citing economic and safety concerns. Once a majority-Muslim town, Srebrenica is now roughly half-Serb, half-Muslim.",
      "Elvisa, Avdic\u2019s wife, said she worries about her children\u2019s future.",
      "\u201cI was 13 years old then in 1995. My daughter is now 13 years old,\u201d she said. \u201cNow, I\u2019m more emotional about that time. When we are older, we care more and we feel more.\u201d",
      "\u201cOur grandmother was killed,\u201d she added. \u201cThey cut her throat.\u201d",
      "Defiance and threats",
      "Avdic said provocations still happen, including when a local priest once played Serb nationalist songs to taunt Muslim residents.",
      "\u201cHe will die with his evil,\u201d Avdic said of the priest.",
      "As denialism spreads, Serb nationalists have grown more defiant. In nearby towns, Avdic is sometimes recognized and mocked by them.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not afraid of them,\u201d he said, though he acknowledged the danger. \u201cYou never know what could happen, because I\u2019m a witness.\u201d",
      "Avdic and his wife are torn. Leaving Srebrenica might be better for their children, but Avdic believes it is his duty to raise his family here and speak for the men and boys who died beside him.",
      "\u201cI will die proud,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I believe my children will be proud they were born here.\u201d"

      "The conflict has its roots in the disputed 500-mile border drawn largely by France, Cambodia\u2019s colonial ruler until 1953. Cambodia and Thailand have fought several deadly skirmishes since the border was delineated in 1907, particularly in the area surrounding the ancient 11th-century Hindu temple of Preah Vihear, which both sides claim as their own but was affirmed as Cambodian by the International Court of Justice in 1962 and again in 2013.

      "The father still maintains his grip over Cambodian affairs, which apparently prompted the call by Paetongtarn, 38, whose father, former Thai Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, was known to be close to the 72-year-old Hun Sen.

      "Negotiating an end is going to be a challenge for both sides, Pou said, as the Thai military\u2019s effective self-governance has created a diplomatic hole between Thailand and Cambodia, which in the past has undermined the possibility of a permanent end to the border dispute.",

      "President Donald Trump also spoke with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in the wake of the mortar strike, with his administration calling for an investigation.",
      "\"Everyone is appalled,\" White House spokesperson Tammy Bruce said at the time.",
      "Netanyahu's office subsequently expressed regret over the strike, while the Israeli military said it would conduct an investigation.",
      "On Wednesday, it announced that the southern command had completed its inquiry the day before, determining that troops had struck the church \"due to an unintentional deviation of munitions,\" in line with its preliminary statement that the strike was accidental.",
      "The Israel Defense Forces acknowledged that the impact of the strike \"caused damage to the structure\" of the church and \"injured several Gazan civilians.\" It did not acknowledge that three people were killed in the incident, according to church officials. Asked to comment on why the fatalities were not mentioned, the IDF acknowledged it was aware of the deaths.",
      "In an interview with Italy\u2019s Corriere della Sera newspaper shortly after the strike, Cardinal Pierbattista Pizzaballa, the Latin patriarch of Jerusalem, expressed doubts over Israel's initial statements which called the incident a mistake.",
      "\u201cWe are not a target. They say it was an error. Even if everybody here believes it wasn\u2019t,\u201d Pizzaballa said.",
      "Francis had made near-nightly calls to Holy Family Church throughout the war in Gaza and up until the days before his death in April, speaking with parish priest, Rev. Gabriel Romanelli, who was injured in last week's attack.",
      "The IDF said adjustments had been made to \u201cimprove the accuracy of fire\u201d during the operation in which the church was struck \u2014 and that following the incident, \u201cguidelines for opening fire near religious buildings, shelters, and other sensitive sites were further clarified.\u201d Asked for further information on what adjustments had been made and how guidelines were further clarified, an IDF spokesperson would not elaborate beyond the initial statement.",
      "Throughout the war in Gaza, civilians have frequently been killed in strikes impacting civilian buildings and shelters, including religious sites.",
      "Last week's incident was also not the first time Holy Family Church has come under attack. The Latin Patriarchate of Jerusalem accused Israeli forces of fatally shooting a woman and her daughter as they walked inside its grounds in December 2023.",
      "Francis condemned the attack at the time. Israeli officials denied responsibility.",
      "The IDF sought to emphasize Wednesday that it had facilitated the transfer of aid to Holy Family Church, in addition to coordinating the visit of a delegation on behalf of the Greek and Latin patriarchs, who were accompanied by a group of Christian clergy. Pizzaballa was among those to make the rare and dangerous trip, with Israel having sealed off the enclave to visits from foreign officials.",
      "The IDF's completion of its probe and the release of its findings were markedly swift, with the military still to release the results of a growing number of investigations since the start of the war in the Gaza Strip.",
      "Israel launched its assault following the Hamas-led Oct. 7, 2023 attacks in which some 1,200 people were killed and around 250 taken hostage, marking a major escalation in a decadeslong conflict.",
      "Since then, more than 59,000 people have been killed in Gaza, including thousands of children, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry in the enclave, while much of the territory has been destroyed."

    "summary": "MLB sees major growth opportunity in India for both fans and players, led by Blue Jays prospect Arjun Nimmala.",
    "story": [
      "Baseball is known as America\u2019s pastime, but it has long been a global game. From the Dominican Republic to Japan to Venezuela, the sport reigns supreme for fans, and countless players are on Major League Baseball rosters.",
      "The next country that could soon be on that list? India.",
      "While its residents may prefer a different game with a ball and a bat \u2014 cricket \u2014 it\u2019s also the motherland of Arjun Nimmala, the top prospect in the Toronto Blue Jays organization. Picked 20th overall in the 2023 draft, Nimmala is the first first-generation Indian American to be selected in the first round.",
      "Nimmala, who grew up outside Tampa, Florida, said his father introduced him to cricket at a young age but also taught him baseball. He fell in love with the sport and played competitively all the way through high school until the Blue Jays selected him at just 17 years old.",
      "Two years later, he is ranked No. 46 out of 900 prospects by MLB and considered a future centerpiece of the organization.",
      "While Nimmala, currently with the Blue Jays\u2019 high-A affiliate Vancouver Canadians, continues to ascend the minor leagues, MLB is doing extensive outreach in India by putting together tournaments for children and taking baseball programs to schools.",
      "\u201cWe want to try to introduce the sport to as many kids as possible,\u201d Chris Marinak, MLB\u2019s chief operations and strategy officer, told NBC News. \u201cThat\u2019s the foot in the door. That\u2019s the way that you educate kids on the game \u2014 you get kids to fall in love with it, and they become fans for the rest of their lives.\u201d",
      "He said the goal is to take baseball to India both on the fields and inside homes.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re focusing on getting our MLB games on broadcast and streaming,\u201d Marinak said. \u201cWe have two partners in India right now that are putting games live for the postseason and the regular season, and we\u2019re seeing great interest from fans around consumption.\u201d",
      "MLB opened an office in India in 2019 and since 2021 has hosted the MLB Cup, a tournament for amateur youth teams across the country.",
      "Nimmala traveled to India in 2023 to see the initiatives the league was producing and to help grow the game in the country where much of his family still lives.",
      "\u201cTo be able to go there and not only see that baseball is a part of India, as well, but just also trying to make it bigger, I think that makes me super proud,\u201d Nimmala said. \u201cKnowing that I have a possibility of doing that and just seeing how much baseball is played in India already, I thought was very cool.\u201d",
      "Asked how big baseball can be in India, a country with 1.46 billion people, Marinak said MLB has high goals.",
      "\u201cWhen you have a billion fans that are watching cricket, it creates a real opportunity to grow the sport,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we can get baseball to the scale of cricket, it would be a huge penetration into that market. It would look a lot like what you see in Japan [and the] United States. It can be done.\u201d",
      "Nimmala says the goal remains to make the major leagues, though that could take multiple years because of his age and experience. His 17 home runs last year led all players ages 18 or younger, and after some early-season struggles, he turned up his production in the second half.",
      "From June 27 on, Nimmala hit .265/.331/.564 with 13 homers over his final 53 games.",
      "Known as a solid fielder, he has elite arm strength, according to MLB.com.",
      "But the stats tell only one part of his story. By just being on the field, Nimmala is inspiring a whole new generation of Indian players.",
      "\u201cI do get a lot of messages, especially on Instagram, from younger kids that are Indian that start to play baseball,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re like, \u2018Dude, I really look up to you.\u2019 I think it\u2019s super cool to see that.\u201d",
      "But even with all the responsibilities of being a trailblazer, he\u2019s keeping his eyes on the prize.",
      "\u201cI have 100% confidence that I will play with the Toronto Blue Jays one day and make an impact.\u201d"

      "As Russian drones peppered their homes, their loved ones fought in trenches and their negotiators waded through more pessimistic diplomacy, Ukrainians waged a new battle on the streets of Kyiv and other major cities.",
      "Activists called for further protests Wednesday over a law signed by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy that curbs the country's top two anti-corruption agencies. The move already fueled the first major demonstrations since Russia launched its full-scale invasion in 2022, and it drew alarm from European officials and experts.",
      "\u201cDestroy Russians, not democracy,\u201d one of the hastily drawn cardboard signs in Kyiv read, while crowds yelled \u201cShame!\u201d and \u201cVeto the law!\u201d",
      "In response to the protests, Zelenskyy announced later Wednesday that he is submitting a new bill that would commit the government to retaining the independence of the anti-corruption agencies.",
      "\u201cAll standards for the independence of anti-corruption institutions will be in place,\u201d Zelenskyy said during his evening address.",
      "While details of the new bill haven\u2019t been made public, it appears to backtrack on the law that sparked the protests.",
      "Before Zelenskyy\u2019s announcement, Natalia, 48, a therapist who, like many in this febrile atmosphere, doesn\u2019t want to use her last name, said trying to restrict anti-corruption agencies risked \u201cendangering the values of freedom, democracy in our country and the future of our children.\u201d",
      "She sees the protests as a way to support the army on the front lines. \u201cI am coming out to give them a signal that we are here,\u201d she said, \u201cso that we are not stolen and betrayed.\u201d",
      "Many worried that the sudden crisis might have offered the Kremlin a powerful propaganda tool and could have threatened not just Ukraine\u2019s unity, but also its support from the West at a crucial moment in the war.",
      "Parliament had swiftly passed the controversial law giving Zelenskyy\u2019s prosecutor general sweeping powers over the National Anti-Corruption Bureau and the Specialised Anti-Corruption Prosecutor\u2019s Office. He said he did that to make them more efficient and to clear out \u201cRussian influence,\u201d but critics feared it would further enhance the power of his divisive inner circle.",
      "It prompted howls of outrage and dismay, from not just Ukrainians themselves, but also Western officials and experts alarmed that the country could be backsliding on its endemic graft problem. It came a week after the arrest of a prominent anti-corruption campaigner who had embarrassed senior officials with investigations into their affairs.",
      "All of it overshadowed a third round of peace talks between Russia and Ukraine that began Wednesday in Istanbul.",
      "Though both sides remain pessimistic about serious progress, they are the first discussions since President Donald Trump gave Russian President Vladimir Putin a 50-day ultimatum to agree to a truce or face new tariffs. Most observers expect another prisoner exchange but little else.",
      "Many Ukrainians are also worried that the country\u2019s opponents will weaponize Zelenskyy\u2019s move as evidence of the corruption that they say makes supporting Kyiv untenable.",
      "The head of Ukraine\u2019s military intelligence directorate, Kyrylo Budanov, even appeared to question the move, warning that \u201cUkrainian history has taught us that a nation loses if it is torn apart by internal contradictions.\u201d",
      "Ukraine\u2019s endemic corruption is one of the reasons it hasn\u2019t been accepted into the European Union and NATO.",
      "Marta Kos, the E.U.\u2019s commissioner for enlargement, said she was \u201cseriously concerned\u201d about the new law, which she called a \u201cserious step back.\u201d",
      "Responding to the criticism Wednesday, Zelenskyy said: \u201cWe all share a common enemy: the Russian occupiers. And defending the Ukrainian state requires a strong enough law enforcement and anti-corruption system \u2014 one that ensures a real sense of justice.\u201d",
      "It also requires air defense against the nightly waves of drones launched by Russia.",
      "Overnight, it shot down 27 of 71 unmanned aircraft, with those that got through killing at least four people and injuring more than 40 across Kherson, Donetsk, Sumy and Kharkiv, officials said.",

      "That rate is lower than the 24% that Trump threatened Japan with on April 2 and the 25% he said he would hit Japanese imports with in a letter on July 7. Before Trump\u2019s current term, the effective U.S. tariff rate on Japanese imports was less than 2%, according to World Bank data.",
      "Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba confirmed the agreement, saying the 15% rate was the lowest so far among countries that sell more goods to the United States than they buy from it.",
      "\u201cWe have exerted all our efforts to protect our national interests,\u201d he told reporters in Tokyo on Wednesday. \u201cAmong the countries that have a trade surplus with the United States, we have achieved the greatest results.\u201d",
