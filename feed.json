      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Corinne Bailey Rae is working on a children's picture book that draws upon her early memories of music.",
      "The Grammy-winning singer-songwriter has a deal with Rocky Pond Books, an imprint of Penguin Young Readers, for \u201cPut Your Records On.\u201d Named for her signature hit and illustrated by Gillian Eilidh O\u2019Mara, the book is scheduled to come out March 3, 2026, and tells the story of a young girl's initiation into her great aunt's record collection.",
      "\u201cWhen I was a child, music helped me find myself. Through songs I discovered that others felt what I felt,\" Rae said in a statement released Wednesday. \"Playing music grew my confidence and writing and performing my own music allowed me to fully express myself. I want every child to know that they have music in their heart and a voice that should be heard.\u201d",

      "President Donald Trump is taking his seat in the president's box for opening night of the award-winning musical \u201cLes Mis\u00e9rables\u201d at the Kennedy Center",
      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump is set to take a seat at Wednesday's opening night of the award-winning musical \u201cLes Mis\u00e9rables\" at the Kennedy Center, where he replaced the previous leadership with loyalists, had himself installed as chairman and pledged to rid the performing arts venue of programming he has complained is \u201cwoke\u201d and too focused on leftist ideology and political correctness.",
      "The Republican president's attendance at the sold-out showing of the Tony Award-winning tale of redemption in 19th century France comes as he has focused more than any recent predecessor on the arts center along the Potomac River that is a memorial to a slain Democratic president.",
      "Presidents' involvement in the Kennedy Center's affairs had been limited to naming members to the board of trustees and attending the taping of its annual honors program in the fall.",
      "But after returning to office in January, Trump stunned the arts world by firing the Kennedy Center's longtime director and board and replacing them with loyalists, who then named him as chairman, and promising to overhaul its programming, management and even appearance as part of an effort to put his stamp on the national arts scene.",
      "Trump's appearance in the Opera House on Wednesday, accompanied by first lady Melania Trump, will also mark his first time at a Kennedy Center performance as president. He avoided the venue after entertainment industry pushback to his policies in his first term in office, breaking with presidential tradition by never attending the annual Kennedy Center Honors taping.",
      "His moves have upset some of the center's patrons and performers.",
      "In March, the audience booed Vice President JD Vance and his wife, Usha, after they slipped into upper-level seats in the Concert Hall to hear the National Symphony Orchestra. Trump appointed Usha Vance to the Kennedy Center board along with White House chief of staff Susie Wiles, Attorney General Pam Bondi and Fox News Channel hosts Maria Bartiromo and Laura Ingraham, among other supporters.",
      "Sales of subscription packages are said to have declined since Trump's takeover, and several touring productions, including \u201cHamilton,\u201d have canceled planned runs at the center. Artists such as actor Issa Rae and musician Rhiannon Giddens scrapped scheduled appearances, and Kennedy Center consultants including musician Ben Folds and singer Ren\u00e9e Fleming have resigned.",
      "Understudies may perform Wednesday night due to boycotts by \u201cLes Mis\u00e9rables\u201d cast members.",
      "Since returning to the White House in January, Trump has adopted a more aggressive posture toward the arts. The White House has taken steps to cancel millions of dollars in previously awarded federal humanities grants to arts and culture groups, and Trump\u2019s budget blueprint proposed eliminating the National Endowment for the Arts and the National Endowment for the Humanities.",
      "Trump has also targeted Smithsonian museums by signing executive orders to restrict their funding and by attempting to fire the director of the National Portrait Gallery.",
      "Trump hosted the board at the White House for dinner in May and said congressional Republicans have pushed for more than $250 million for repairs and maintenance at the Kennedy Center. He claimed that \u201ctremendous amounts of money\u201d had been spent at the center but \u201cthey certainly didn't spend it on wallpaper, carpet or painting.\u201d",
      "He characterized previous programming as \u201cout of control with rampant political propaganda\u201d and said it featured \u201csome very inappropriate shows,\u201d including a \u201cMarxist anti-police performance\u201d and \u201cLesbian-only Shakespeare.\u201d",
      "Trump cited some drag show performances as a reason to take control of the center, though next season's theater lineup includes \u201dMrs. Doubtfire,\" which tells the story of a divorced man who disguises himself as a female nanny so he can spend time with his children.",
      "Trump also visited the Kennedy Center in March to preside over a board meeting and take a tour.",
      "The Kennedy Center, which is supported by government money and private donations, opened in 1971 and for decades has been seen as an apolitical celebration of the arts.",
      "It was first conceived in the late 1950s, during the administration of Republican President Dwight Eisenhower, who backed a bill from the Democratic-led Congress calling for a National Culture Center. In the early 1960s, Democratic President John F. Kennedy launched a fundraising initiative, and his successor, President Lyndon B. Johnson, signed into law a 1964 bill renaming the project the John F. Kennedy Memorial Center for the Performing Arts. Kennedy had been assassinated the year before.",

      "German news agency dpa reported that his family confirmed he died at the university hospital in his hometown of D\u00fcsseldorf in western Germany Tuesday night. They did not give a cause of death.",
      "For decades, Uecker, who was often dubbed \u201cthe nail artist,\u201d created art by hammering carpenter\u2019s nails into chairs, pianos, sewing machines and canvases. His works can be found in museums and collections across the globe.",
      "In his art work, seemingly endless numbers of nails, which would by themselves perhaps be perceived as potentially aggressive and hurtful, turned into harmonic, almost organic creations. His reliefs with the tightly hewn nails are reminiscent of waving grasses or fields of algae in a marine landscape.",
      "Uecker himself described his nail art as diary-like landscapes of the soul, which he called an \u201cexpression of the poetic power of man,\u201d dpa reported.",
      "Hendrik W\u00fcst, the governor of North Rhine-Westphalia which includes state capital D\u00fcsseldorf, called Uecker \u201cone of the most important and influential artists in German post-war history\u201d and said that with his life\u2019s work, he influenced generations of young artists and \u201ccontributed to an open and dynamic society.\"",
      "Born on March 13, 1930, in the village of Wendorf on the Baltic Sea, Uecker moved to D\u00fcsseldorf in the mid-1950s, where he studied and later also taught at the city's prestigious art academy.",
      "In one of his most spectacular appearances or art happenings, he rode on the back of a camel through the hallways of the venerable academy in 1978. Together with fellow artist Gerhard Richter, he \u201coccupied\u201d the Kunsthalle Baden-Baden museum in 1968, with both kissing in front of the cameras.",
      "The son of a farmer, he traveled the world with a humanitarian message of peace and exhibited in countless countries, including dictatorships and totalitarian states. He painted ash pictures after the Chernobyl nuclear disaster in Ukraine in 1986, and exhibited human rights messages painted on fabric in Beijing.",
      "He also painted \u201cVerletzungsw\u00f6rter,\u201d or words of violence, killing and torment in many languages and foreign scripts on large canvases. In 2023, Uecker erected a stone memorial in Weimar in memory of the victims of the Nazi concentration camp Buchenwald.",
      "\u201cThe theme of my artistic work is the vulnerability of man by man,\u201d he said.",

      "\u201cDuring the years, there has been a sort of evolutionary history, you could say. And you could see these animals as sort of natural historical objects,\u201d the 77-year old artist told The Associated Press before the installation\u2019s opening.",
      "The Strandbeesten Mortuary, as the exhibition is called, follows the various versions of the mobile sculptures since 1990 when Jansen created the first one from plastic pipes and tape. As the animals evolved, Jansen incorporated plastic bottles, wooden planks, cloth and cardboard.",
      "The life and death cycle of these famous animals \u2014 formed mostly out of PVC pipes \u2014 has left behind an impressive fossil record, which is on display at the exhibition.",
      "Marloes Koster, who organized the exhibition for Delft\u2019s Prinsenhof Museum, said that Jansen\u2019s ultimate goal is to create a beast that will live forever.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s not there yet, so these are the ones that didn\u2019t make it,\u201d she added.",
      "The museum is undergoing major renovations, so Koster and her colleagues have been putting together arts and culture events at alternative venues around the city while the building is shut.",
      "Born near the North Sea, Jansen grew up captivated by the wind that often hits the Dutch coastline. He harnessed it to allow his animals to \u201cwalk\u201d along the beach. Every year, he creates a new strandbeest and, at the end of the summer, declares the animal dead.",
      "\u201cAll summer I do experiments, and in the fall I\u2019m a little bit wiser (about) how these animals should survive in the future,\u201d Jansen said.",
      "Many of the visitors to the opening of the exhibition had followed Jansen\u2019s work for years and were keen to understand how the strandbeesten had changed over time.",
      "\u201cYou see a kind of development in the way he does things. So they start out very simple, and then it gets increasingly complicated. So they evolve,\u201d said Cor Nonhof, a Delft local who had come to see the exhibition with his wife.",
      "Even at the opening, Jansen was already keen to return to the beach to work on the latest evolution of his strandbeesten.",

      "In the heart of Spain\u2019s capital, the famous Sobrino de Bot\u00edn restaurant proudly holds the title of being the world\u2019s oldest restaurant",
      "MADRID -- In the heart of Spain's capital, Sobrino de Bot\u00edn holds a coveted Guinness World Record as the world's oldest restaurant. Exactly three hundred years after it opened its doors, Bot\u00edn welcomes droves of daily visitors hungry for Castilian fare with a side of history.",
      "But on the outskirts of Madrid, far from the souvenir shops and tourist sites, a rustic tavern named Casa Pedro makes a bold claim. Its owners assert the establishment endured not just the Spanish Civil War in the 1930s and the Napoleonic invasion in the early 1800s, but even the War of Spanish Succession at the start of the 18th century \u2014 a lineage that would make Casa Pedro older than Bot\u00edn and a strong contender for the title.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s really frustrating when you say, \u2018Yes, we\u2019ve been around since 1702,\u2019 but ... you can\u2019t prove it,\u201d said manager and eighth-generation proprietor Irene Gui\u00f1ales. \u201cIf you look at the restaurant\u2019s logo, it says \u2018Casa Pedro, since 1702,\u2019 so we said, \u2018Damn it, let\u2019s try to prove it.\u2019\u201d",
      "Gui\u00f1ales, 51, remembers her grandfather swearing by Casa Pedro\u2019s age, but she was aware that decades-old hearsay from a proud old-timer wouldn't be enough to prove it. Her family hired a historian and has so far turned up documents dating the restaurant's operations to at least 1750.",
      "That puts them within striking distance of Bot\u00edn\u2019s record.",
      "Both taverns are family-owned. Both offer Castilian classics like stewed tripe and roast suckling pig. They are decorated with charming Spanish tiles, feature ceilings with exposed wooden beams and underground wine cellars. And both enjoy a rich, star-studded history.",
      "Bot\u00edn's celebrated past includes a roster of literary patrons like Truman Capote, F. Scott Fitzgerald and Graham Greene. In his book \u201cThe Sun Also Rises,\u201d Ernest Hemingway described it as \u201cone of the best restaurants in the world.\" While Casa Pedro may not have boasted the same artistic pedigree, it boasts its own VIPs. Its walls are adorned with decades-old photographs of former Spanish King Juan Carlos I dining in one of its many rooms. The current Spanish monarch, King Felipe VI dines there, too, albeit more inconspicuously than his father.",
      "But the similarities between the two hotspots end there.",
      "Casa Pedro was once a stop on the only road heading north from the Spanish capital toward France. Its clientele is largely local regulars, like David Gonz\u00e1lez and Mayte Villena, who for years have spent every Friday lunching at the tavern.",
      "\u201cIt wouldn't change a thing for us,\u201d Villena said about the restaurant someday securing the Guinness title.",
      "Bot\u00edn, on the other hand, is a stone\u2019s throw from Madrid\u2019s famed Plaza Mayor, where any day of the week tour guides are herding groups around town \u2014 and often straight through the restaurant's front door.",
      "Antonio Gonz\u00e1lez, a third-generation proprietor of Bot\u00edn, concedes that the Guinness accolade awarded in 1987 has helped business, but said the restaurant had enough history to draw visitors even before.",
      "\u201cIt has a certain magic,\u201d he said.",
      "The question then becomes: How can either restaurant definitively claim the title? Guinness provides its specific guidelines for the superlative only to applicants, according to spokesperson Kylie Galloway, noting that it entails \u201csubstantial evidence and documentation of the restaurant\u2019s operation over the years.\"",
      "Gonz\u00e1lez said that Guinness required Bot\u00edn show that it has continuously operated in the same location with the same name.",
      "The only time the restaurant closed was during the COVID-19 pandemic, as did Casa Pedro.",
      "That criteria would mean that restaurants that are even older \u2014 Paris' Le Procope, which says it was founded in 1686, or Beijing\u2019s Bianyifang, founded in 1416, or the 1673-established White Horse Tavern in Newport, Rhode Island \u2014 aren't eligible for the designation.",
      "La Campana, in Rome\u2019s historic center, claims over 500 years of operation, citing documents on its menu and in a self-published history. Its owners say they have compiled the requisite paperwork and plan to submit it to Guinness.",
      "Gui\u00f1ales and her husband couldn't consult archives from the former town of Fuencarral, now a Madrid neighborhood. Those papers went up in flames during the Spanish Civil War. Instead, they delved into Spanish national archives, where they found land registries of the area from the First Marquess of Ensenada (1743-1754) that showed the existence of a tavern, wine cellar and inn in the small town as of 1750.",
      "In their spare time, the couple continues to hunt for records proving that Casa Pedro indeed dates back to 1702, as is proclaimed on its walls, takeout bags and sugar packets.",
      "But even if they dig up the final documents and wrest the Guinness honor from Bot\u00edn, Gui\u00f1ales concedes that her restaurant's quiet location makes it unlikely to draw Bot\u00edn\u2019s clientele in central Madrid.",
      "\u201cTo think that we could reach that public would be incredible,\u201d Gui\u00f1ales said. \u201cIt's a dream, but it's a dream.\u201d",

      "Morris also said he\u2019d rarely seen stories set in the kind of youth group he\u2019d grown up in.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve just never seen that little world written about in a way that I thought was like, accurate or, like, that got what it was about,\u201d he said.",
      "Published last year by New York-based First Second Books, \u201cYouth Group\u201d tells the story of Kay Radford, a theater kid who winds up joining the Stone Mission megachurch youth group after her parents split up. Her mom is a true believer but lonely. Kay is more skeptical but lonely as well and angry at her dad.",
      "\u201cChurch might help with all this,\u201d Kay\u2019s mom tells her early on. \u201cI think we both could use some community.\u201d",
      "At the youth group, Kay is met by youth leader Meg Parks, a kind but sometimes over-the-top youth leader in pink; a bearded, hippy pastor who turns the \u201cPina Colada song\u201d \u2014 the Rupert Holmes hit \u201cEscape\u201d \u2014 into a metaphor for spiritual seeking; and a band that churns out parodies like \u201cI Saw the Christ\u201d sung to the melody of Ace of Base\u2019s \u201cThe Sign.\u201d",
      "Though fictional, the songs fit the kind of pop culture reference \u2014 sometimes known as a \u201cJesus juke\u201d \u2014 that youth groups can be known for.",
      "\u201cI always think there\u2019s something funny about that move, where you take a secular piece of entertainment, like a song that\u2019s in the zeitgeist, or a popular movie and try and give the hidden religious message,\u201d Morris said.",
      "Kay eventually discovers the youth pastor and some of the older Stone Mission kids also fight demons. That fight becomes personal after one of the demons goes after her dad, and Kay decides to join the battle. Along the way, the Stone Mission kids team up with youth groups from other faiths \u2014 Temple Beth Israel, Immaculate Heart parish and the Polaris Coven \u2014 to fight off a demon invasion with the help of some training by an order of nuns.",
      "Morris said he and illustrator Bowen McCurdy wanted to tell a story that was more than just satire. And while he no longer embraces the faith of his youth, Morris still sees value in the lessons he learned, like the importance of loving your neighbor.",
      "\u201cWe wanted to tell a story of people from a lot of different religions coming together with a common goal,\u201d he said.",
      "Matthew Cressler, a religion scholar and creator of the webcomic series \u201cBad Catholics, Good Trouble,\u201d said comics with evangelical or denominational settings like \u201cYouth Group\u201d are uncommon. Religion in comics, he said, is often seen as \u201ca marker of difference\u201d: for example, Kamala Khan, the Muslim-American hero known as Ms. Marvel, or Matt Murdock, better known as Daredevil, who is Irish-Catholic. In the 1960s, when Daredevil was created, Catholics were still seen as outsiders to the American mainstream, and many of the most popular heroes, like Batman, were seen as Mainline Protestants.",
      "While there were comics for evangelicals, they were often evangelistic, like the controversial Jack Chick tracts or the Christianized adventures of Archie and his friends, published by Spire Comics starting in the 1970s. And evangelicals have often downplayed the kind of sacramental imagery and architecture found in mainline or Catholic settings and try to avoid the kind of visuals needed for comics, said Cressler.",
      "Matthew Brake, founder and editor of online publication Pop Culture and Theology, said non-denominational churches often have a \u201clet\u2019s go to the mall aesthetic\u201d and lack the visual clout of Catholicism.",
      "\u201cNondenominational churches are sort of a cultural underdog,\u201d he said.",
      "That may change, Brake said, as creators like Morris, who grew up in non-denominational settings, come of age. And those settings often contain surprises. Although they are most known for things like worship music and purity culture, megachurches also provide space to talk about things like social justice.",
      "Still, he wonders if many nondenominational Christians would be the kinds of fans that would enjoy a book like \u201cYouth Group\u201d or \u201cPreacher,\u201d a late-1990s comic about an evangelical pastor who ends up possessed by a supernatural being.",
      "David Canham, who reviews comics for the secular pop-culture website AIPT \u2014 short for \u201cAdventures in Poor Taste\u201d \u2014 had mixed feelings about \u201cYouth Group.\u201d",
      "\u201cFirst off, there\u2019s plenty of \u201990s nostalgia \u2014 a good-natured tongue-in-cheek look back at many of the silly and absurd things about \u201990s culture, with a focus on evangelical Christian culture,\u201d he wrote when the book came out. \u201c\u2018Youth Group\u2019 delivers on this point.\u201d",
      "But the book\u2019s take on pluralism \u2014 the idea that all religion is on the same side \u2014 turned him off as an evangelical Christian. \u201cI don\u2019t want to recommend a book that promotes a worldview that so strongly disagrees with my own beliefs,\u201d he wrote.",
      "At first, Morris said he was worried the book might offend Christians and atheists alike. Some evangelicals might feel the book mocks their faith, while atheists might think the book overlooks the shortcomings of religious groups.",
      "Both those criticisms would be fair, he said. Religious groups get a lot of things wrong, and yet churches and other faith groups remain important to their members. Morris said he tried to walk a fine line of gently poking fun at faith while showing why it still has an impact on people\u2019s lives, and how the friendships made in youth groups may long endure.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t want the humor to be like, church is stupid, or say, \u2018look at this dumb church stuff,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cI wanted it to be funny and familiar.\u201d",
      "Morris said he wanted to capture the mixed feelings people have about the faiths in which they grew up. While he appreciated Bible teachings like caring for the needy, some of the politics and social messages, especially about LGBTQ+ folks, were a turnoff, he said.",
      "Religion, he said, is complicated.",
      "\u201cThere are a lot of wonderful memories, and there\u2019s a lot of stuff that gives me the ick,\u201d he said. \u201cI hope that\u2019s in the book. I hope you can see how a religious upbringing can be upsetting and wonderful \u2014 comforting but also makes you mad.\u201d",

Color-wrapped buses bearing BTS members\u2019 faces lined the streets while red and yellow balloons floated above and a decorated food truck provided free coffee and water, adding to the festive atmosphere.",
      "Many supporters wore masks, conscious of potential backlash after the band\u2019s label discouraged attendance citing safety concerns. Despite the challenges, fans like Anaesi from Portugal said the 20-hour journey to Yeoncheon, a town near the tense border with North Korea, was worth it.",
      "\u201cPortugal is a small country, but inside of Portugal, BTS is a king,\u201d she said. Anaesi, who discovered BTS on YouTube, said the group \u201csaved\u201d her from depression. \u201cSo for me BTS is my angel,\u201d she said.

      "Jin, the oldest BTS member, was discharged in June 2024. J-Hope was discharged in October.",
      "In South Korea, all able-bodied men aged 18 to 28 are required by law to perform 18-21 months of military service under a conscription system meant to deter aggression from rival North Korea.",
      "The law gives special exemptions to athletes, classical and traditional musicians, and ballet and other dancers if they have obtained top prizes in certain competitions and are assessed to have enhanced national prestige. K-pop stars and other entertainers aren\u2019t subject to such privileges.",
      "However, in 2020, BTS postponed their service until age 30 after South Korea\u2019s National Assembly revised its Military Service Act, allowing K-pop stars to delay their enlistment until age 30.",
      "There was heated public debate in 2022 over whether to offer special exemptions of mandatory military service for BTS members, until the group\u2019s management agency announced in October 2022 that all seven members would fulfill their duties.",

      "Metro Nashville Police said Smith, 24, hit Dorothy Dobbins, 77, Sunday evening while she was crossing the road inside a marked crosswalk. Dobbins, a retired attorney, later died at a hospital. The Tennessee Bar Association posted on its website that Dobbins had been out walking her dog when she was hit.",
      "Police say Smith showed no signs of impairment. They believe the \u201cpreliminary contributing factor\u201d appears to be that Smith did not yield the right of way to the pedestrian.",
      "Smith\u2019s attorney, Worrick Robinson, said his client is cooperating with the investigation.",

      "Lame arrived in the U.S. on April 30 and \u201coverstayed the terms of his visa,\u201d the ICE spokesperson said. The Associated Press sent a message seeking comment Tuesday to the email address listed on Lame\u2019s Instagram account. He has not publicly commented on his detainment.",
      "His detainment and voluntary departure from the U.S. comes amid President Donald Trump\u2019s escalating crackdown on immigration, including raids in Los Angeles that sparked days of protests against ICE, as the president tests the bounds of his executive authority.",
      "A voluntary departure \u2014 which was granted to Lame \u2014 allows those facing removal from the U.S. to avoid a deportation order on their immigration record, which could prevent them from being allowed back into the U.S. for up to a decade.",
      "The 25-year-old rose to international fame during the pandemic without ever saying a word in his videos, which would show him reacting to absurdly complicated \u201clife hacks.\" He has over 162 million followers on TikTok alone.",
      "The Senegal-born influencer moved to Italy when he was an infant with his working class parents and has Italian citizenship.",
      "His internet fame quickly evolved. He signed a multi-year partnership with designer brand Hugo Boss in 2022. In January, he was appointed as a UNICEF goodwill ambassador.",

      "The admission from Victoria Heuermann isn\u2019t made on camera but through a statement from producers near the end of \u201cThe Gilgo Beach Killer: House of Secrets,\u201d a three-part documentary on NBC\u2019s streaming service Peacock.",
      "\u201cA week before the series release, Victoria Heuermann told the producers that based on publicly available facts that have been presented and explained to her, she now believes her father is most likely the Gilgo Beach killer,\u201d reads a statement at the close of the final episode of the documentary.",
      "Bob Macedonio, an attorney for Heuermann\u2019s now ex-wife, Asa Ellerup, said in a statement after the documentary\u2019s release that \u201ctime will only tell\u201d whether his client will ever accept that her husband may have been a serial killer.",
      "Heuermann\u2019s lawyer didn\u2019t respond to an email seeking comment.",
      "The Manhattan architect has been charged with killing seven women, most of them sex workers, and dumping their bodies on a desolate parkway not far from Gilgo Beach on Long Island, some 50 miles (80 kilometers) from Manhattan.",
      "He has pleaded not guilty and is due back in Riverhead court June 17 as a judge continues to weigh whether to allow key DNA evidence into the trial.",
      "In the documentary, Victoria Heuermann struggles to reconcile her childhood memories with the portrait of the killer described by authorities.",
      "She says her father was around the family \u201c90% of the time\u201d and was never violent toward any of them.",
      "At the same time, Victoria Heuermann acknowledged there were times when he stayed home while the family went on vacation and that she was around 10 to 13 years old when the killings happened. Prosecutors say Heuerman committed some of the killings in the basement while his family was out of town.",
      "\u201cWhether or not I believe my dad did it or not, I\u2019m on the fence about that,\u201d said the now 28-year-old. \u201cPart of me thinks he didn\u2019t do it, but at the same time, I don\u2019t know, he could have just totally had a double life.\u201d",
      "Ellerup, for her part, maintained she saw no \u201cabnormal behavior\u201d in their nearly three decades of marriage.",
      "She dismissed a computer file prosecutors claim is a \u201cblueprint\u201d of his crimes as \u201cabsurd.\u201d",
      "Prosecutors say the document features a series of checklists for before, during and after a killing, such as a \u201cbody prep\u201d checklist that includes among other items a note to \u201cremove head and hands.\u201d",
      "Ellerup also shrugged off other evidence prosecutors have enumerated in court documents, including a vast collection of bondage and torture pornography found on electronic devices seized from their home, and hairs linked to Heuermann that were recovered on most of the victims\u2019 bodies.",
      "At the same time, she revealed that in July 2009, around the time one of his alleged victims went missing, Heuermann suddenly renovated a bathroom while she and their two children visited her family in Iceland. But she noted her former husband eventually joined the family for their final week of the trip.",
      "\u201cMy husband, he\u2019s a family man. He\u2019s my hero,\u201d Ellerup said. \u201cWhat I want to say to him is, \u2018I love you, no matter what.\u2019\u201d",
      "Ellerup divorced Heuermann after his arrest in 2023. But in the documentary, Victoria Heuermann says the separation was for financial reasons to protect the family\u2019s assets.",
      "Indeed, the filmmakers captured the family speaking to Heuermann by phone from jail, and the mother and daughter have been regularly attending court hearings with their attorney.",
      "The family, which also includes Ellerup\u2019s adult son from a prior marriage, is also planning to put up its notoriously ramshackle house in well-to-do Massapequa Park for sale as they look to move to a property they own in South Carolina.",
      "Ryan McCormick, an NBCUniversal spokesperson, declined to say how much family was compensated, though he said the payments could not go toward Heuermann or his defense funds.",
      "The documentary was produced by rapper 50 Cent\u2019s G-Unit Film and Television production company alongside Texas Crew Productions and New York Post Entertainment.",

      "Before Celine Song was an Oscar-nominated filmmaker, she was a playwright in New York who needed day jobs to pay rent. That\u2019s how she found herself as a professional matchmaker.",
      "What may have begun as a purely transactional gig, a way for her to keep making her art in an expensive city, taught her more about people\u2019s wants and needs and the true contents of their hearts than she could have ever imagined.",
      "\u201cI always wanted to write something about it because there seemed to be a story in it that is massive and very epic in proportion,\u201d Song said. \u201cIt affects every human being on Earth.\"",
      "And while waiting for her breakout film \u201cPast Lives\u201d to debut, she did. That film is \u201cMaterialists,\u201d a modern-day New York love story starring Dakota Johnson, Pedro Pascal and Chris Evans that\u2019s heading to theaters this weekend. Johnson is the matchmaker presented with two different types of men for herself \u2014 one a poor struggling actor and ex-boyfriend, the other a wealthy \u201cunicorn\u201d \u2014 and the internet has already been drawing battle lines. But, like \u201cPast Lives\u201d wasn\u2019t really about a love triangle, \u201cMaterialists\u201d is about something more than the question of which guy is the \u201ccorrect\u201d choice.",
      "Song and Johnson spoke with The Associated Press about the film, falling in love and the modern marketplace of dating. Remarks have been edited for clarity and brevity.",
      "SONG: We met up thinking that we were just going to get to know each other and be friends and I walked away from that conversation \u2014 this is just from my perspective \u2014 but I think I was still sitting there when I texted my producers and the studio being like, \u201cI think I\u2019ve found my Lucy.\u201d That\u2019s how casting works for me, it\u2019s always about falling in love. It\u2019s very connected to what we talk about in the film. Like, there\u2019s no mathematical anything. It just the feeling that you get talking to someone and you\u2019re like, oh I just know.",
      "JOHNSON: I knew you had this movie that you were about to start making. I was basically told it was too late. I was like, but I really want to meet her because she\u2019s so smart, and I\u2019ve seen interviews and obviously had seen \u201cPast Lives.\u201d I just wanted talk and get to know her as an artist and a person and so I went into this being like there\u2019s no chance that I\u2019ll be in this movie, but maybe she\u2019ll make another one. We just had such a good time talking, I didn\u2019t even know that I was someone she was thinking about. A few weeks later we spoke. It was very romantic.",
      "JOHNSON: She\u2019s sort of at the top of her game in her work and is very disconnected from her heart and focused on being a perfectionist and getting people to get married. On the surface, you see her as a very transactional person and not really invested in people\u2019s souls, but she actually is and really does want the best for them. She\u2019s also on her own journey of trying to figure out what it is she wants for herself in this life, and, essentially, do you fight for the thing that you think you want, or do you fight for that thing that you know you need? Is that right, Celine?",
      "SONG: That\u2019s so good.",
      "SONG: It was never going to be a conversation about which flavor of a person. It\u2019s actually so much more about this marketplace of dating that all of us live in if you\u2019re single, and also the marketplace that Dakota\u2019s character is navigating. She knows the math better than anyone else in the film. She\u2019s an excellent matchmaker.",
      "Pedro plays somebody who is probably, in straight dating, someone of the highest possible value. Chris\u2019 character, in the spectrum in the marketplace of values of dating, is someone who is of the lowest value possible. I find them to be such adorable characters, very worthy of an adoration.",
      "Lucy knows exactly where they fall in the in the stock market of men. It\u2019s actually about the way that the math around that is going to blow up.",
      "JOHNSON: Celine speaks so eloquently about the marketplace of dating and I glitch at those words because I\u2019m like, you can\u2019t explain love that way. But that\u2019s actually how people are. Marriage used to be a business deal. It was like, my father wants your cows and my mother needs your wheat and whatever. It was a trade-off. But now there\u2019s all these books about how we expect our partner to fulfill every single aspect of our needs. And the world being dominated by social media, people don\u2019t meet in real life anymore. They don\u2019t behave normally in public.",
      "People are in a very strange place in evolution, and I think the difference between these two characters and these two men, sure they are different ends of the spectrum in terms of like technical value, materialistic value. But also each of them have the opposite in terms of psycho-spiritual value and emotional value and what they can offer the other person in terms of soul evolution and growth.",
      "Perhaps because she works in this world of trying to understand people and what they want, she\u2019s forced to go more inward and really interrogate herself and say, what do I really want and what is actually important in this life? Is it how much money I have or is it how truly loved I am?",
      "SONG: To me, it\u2019s about this contradiction, right? It\u2019s this thing of how we talk about what we want in our partner, when we\u2019re asked to use language to describe it, and how we literally, spiritually fall in love. The gap between those two things is terrifyingly big. To me, that\u2019s where the mystery of the film is.",

      "Harm reductions initiatives are becoming more commonplace at major music festivals, both through partnerships with festival organizers as well as volunteer efforts done without explicit permission",
      "NEW YORK -- The sounds of muffled percussion and audience cheers reverberate throughout the grounds. Brand activations, makeshift bars and restaurant pop-ups control traffic as a sea of bodies move from set to set. Sandwiched between is a row of nonprofits across familiar causes: hunger, housing and voter registration.",
      "It's a common music festival scene, until closer inspection. There is a new table, This Must Be the Place. The Ohio-based nonprofit offers attendees free opioid overdose reversal treatment and training on how to use it, an education acquired in under two minutes. Just a few years ago, their inclusion might've been unthinkable amid murky regulations and a lack of public awareness surrounding harm reduction.",
      "Advocates say drugs are commonly consumed at music festivals, making them ideal locations for harm reduction activities. While more music festivals are allowing such activities, activists are pushing for expanded efforts as some festivals remain cautious.",
      "Founded by William Perry and Ingela Travers-Hayward in 2022, This Must Be The Place has since given away an estimated $4.5 million in naloxone, the opioid overdose reversal medication, at festivals and smaller community events.",
      "In the very beginning, without a \u201cproof of concept,\u201d as Perry describes it, they had trouble partnering with festivals. Eventually, a few festivals in the Midwest agreed to let them table, which \u201cgot us in the door with Bonnaroo in 2022,\u201d says Perry, referring to the major U.S. festival operated by C3 Presents, one of the largest concert promoters on the planet. Now they have a presence at 35 major U.S. festivals \u2014 including Lollapalooza, Governors Ball and Besame Mucho \u2014 where they collaborate directly with C3 and their security personnel.",
      "The organization's growth overlaps with advancing federal regulations. According to Daliah Heller, vice president of overdose prevention initiatives at the global public health nonprofit Vital Strategies, naloxone distribution used to be determined by state regulations until 2023, when the Food and Drug Administration approved the first over-the-counter nasal spray.",
      "\u201cWe no longer need the prescription laws to be amended to allow for the distribution of naloxone,\u201d she says. \u201cNow it's like buying aspirin \u2014 it's over the counter.\u201d",
      "Last year, This Must Be the Place gave away 46,146 units of Narcan \u2014 a brand name for naloxone \u2014 through their national festival outreach.",
      "Emmett Beliveau, chief operating officer of C3 Presents, says working with This Must Be the Place was C3\u2019s first time implementing public-facing harm reduction strategies, in addition to the promoter's existing medical programs.",
      "Bringing the organization into C3\u2019s festivals was \u201cnot in response to anything that has happened at one of our festivals,\u201d he says, but rather because of the \u201cnumber of fatalities happening in our communities.\u201d",
      "Some activists believe attendees are most responsive to receiving harm reduction education from peers instead of authority figures. And so, for the last three years, a nonprofit dedicated to combating accidental drug overdoses among young adults, Team Awareness Combating Overdose, has distributed fentanyl test strips and Narcan at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival.",
      "Former TACO CEO Kameran Mody says that music festivals are ideal locations for distribution and education because \u201cmusic and the use of drugs are synonymous with each other.\u201d",
      "TACO distributes through what Mody describes as \u201cguerrilla-style marketing.\u201d They enlist volunteers, train them on how to use naloxone, and ship Narcan and test strips to them to bring into the festival.",
      "They do not involve the festival organizers. Representatives for Coachella did not respond to The Associated Press' requests for comment.",
      "In 2023, a TACO volunteer administered Narcan to an unresponsive Coachella attendee exhibiting signs of an overdose. The organization says the attendee regained consciousness.",
      "\u201cThat was one of our biggest successes,\u201d Mody says.",
      "In 2019, at Bonnaroo, a 27-year-old man was found dead at his campsite \u2014 right after harm reduction activists had picketed the Tennessee festival because it didn't allow drug testing. The toxicology report found ecstasy and fentanyl in his system.",
      "At the time, under state law, test strips were criminalized and classified as drug paraphernalia. That\u2019s changed: In 2022, Tennessee decriminalized fentanyl test strips. By the end of 2023, 44 other states and D.C. had done the same.",
      "But in some states, drug paraphernalia laws are written in a way that isn't completely transparent \u2014 there are test strips that are not fentanyl-specific, Heller points out \u2014 and criminalization and social stigmas endure.",
      "Some have found workarounds. \u201cEven in the states where the legalities were a bit unclear, instead of just coming in and hoping things worked out, we would reach out to the health department, and say \u2018We run this project, how do feel about it?\u2019\u201d says Perry. \u201cWe would end up with letters from the highest-ranking health official, either in the county or in the state, saying \u2018We approve of this.\u2019 That circumvented any roadblocks.\u201d",
      "Some festivals, though, might be hesitant to use test strips because \u201cit\u2019s tough for them to admit that drugs are being used,\u201d Mody says. Some festivals have even banned naloxone.",
      "While This Must Be The Place distributes fentanyl test strips at some Ohio events, C3 doesn't distribute test strips at its events and does not plan to. Beliveau doesn't believe fentanyl test strips are effective and expressed concern they could encourage drug use. Test strips, which can detect fentanyl in pills, powders or injectables, are recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as a low-cost means of helping prevent drug overdoses.",
      "At a three-day electronic music festival in Mexico City earlier this year, a booth provided free, anonymous drug testing. The initiative, known as \u201cCheca tu Sustancia\u201d (Check Your Substance), was spearheaded by the Instituto RIA, a Mexico-based drug policy research and advocacy organization.",
      "When unexpected substances are detected, users received detailed information on what they are, their risks, potential interactions with other substances and dosage adjustments, empowering them to make informed choices.",
      "Perry says they are aware of smaller festivals in the United States conducting drug checking, but \u201cthey do it in a very underground and whisper network way\u201d to avoid criminalization.",
      "What Perry says his organization would like to see at music festivals in the future would be harm reduction areas \u2014 sections where attendees who have taken drugs can be monitored, not to \u201cget them into trouble\u201d but to ensure safety.",
      "Heller says there are a number of groups working to destigmatize drugs, promote decriminalization, and promote drug checking.",
      "\u201cWe already have drug checking happening in cities,\u201d she says. \u201cIt makes perfect sense to expand the settings where you would offer that to include music festivals. It's the same rationale. ... The issue is this idea of liability. You\u2019d have to create a law, essentially, that would protect the festival from liability.\u201d",

Five years later, she phoned with the news that \u201cShe's Come Undone\u201d was her latest book club pick. In 1998, Winfrey picked Lamb's \u201cI Know This Much Is True,\u201d his second novel.",

      "Jurors in Harvey Weinstein\u2019s sex crimes retrial appear to be focusing on one of his three accusers as they deliberate for a fourth day",
      "NEW YORK -- Jurors in Harvey Weinsteinn'ssex crimes retrial appeared to be focusing on one of his three accusers as deliberations stretched into a fourth day Tuesday, with no further sign of interpersonal tensions that flared earlier.",
      "The jury had requested to start off Tuesday with electronic copies of emails and other evidence pertaining to Jessica Mann \u2014 the accuser with arguably the most complex history with Weinstein. Jurors deliberated through the morning without sending any further requests.",
      "During days of testimony, Mann said the Oscar-winning movie producer raped her in 2013 amid a consensual relationship that continued for years afterward. Weinstein\u2019s lawyers emphasized that she kept seeing him, accepting invitations and sending warm messages to him. Mann said she \u201ccompartmentalized\u201d the pain he caused her.",
      "Weinstein, 73, has pleaded not guilty to all the charges in the case. In addition to the rape charge, he's accused of sexually assaulting two other women, Mimi Haley and Kaja Sokola.",
      "Weinstein didn't testify during the current trial, but maintained through his attorneys that he had completely consensual encounters with his accusers, who wanted his help building show business careers.",
      "Weinstein was one of the movie industry's most powerful figures until a series of sexual misconduct allegations against him became public in 2017, fueling the #MeToo movement and eventually leading to criminal charges.",
      "The jury is made up of seven women and five men. Their closed-door discussions began Thursday and apparently have been fractious at times.",
      "One juror asked Friday to be excused because he felt one member of the group was being treated unfairly. Then on Monday, the foreperson complained to the judge, prosecutors and defense lawyers that some jurors were \u201cpushing\" others to change their minds, talking about Weinstein's past and going beyond the charges.",
      "The foreperson didn't specify what was said. Trial evidence has included some testimony about allegations outside the scope of the current charges, such as mentions of the groundswell of claims against the ex-studio boss in 2017.",
      "Yet another juror soon asked to speak to the court, where she opined that things were \u201cgoing well.\u201d By the end of Monday, the jury as a whole said in a note that it was \u201cmaking good progress.\u201d",
      "There was progress Tuesday on at least one front: Jurors ultimately were given coffee, as requested, Judge Curtis Farber said. He hadn't initially thought the state court system could provide it.",
      "Weinstein originally was convicted in New York in 2020 of raping Mann and forcing oral sex on Haley. Sokola's allegation was added last year, after New York state's highest court overturned the 2020 conviction and sent the case back for retrial.",
      "Meanwhile, Weinstein is appealing a 2022 rape conviction in Los Angeles.",
      "The Associated Press generally does not identify people without their permission if they say they have been sexually assaulted. Sokola, Mann and Haley have agreed to be named.",

      "A Connecticut judge has settled a bitter feud over the estate of the late legendary blues guitarist Johnny Winter, ordering his managers to pay $226,000 in damages for improper payments they received after his 2014 death and rejecting their claim to the rights to his music.",
      "Relatives of Winter's late wife, Susan, sued Winter's manager, Paul Nelson, and his wife, Marion, in 2020, claiming the Nelsons swindled more than $1 million from Winter's music business. The Nelsons denied the allegations and countersued. They accused the relatives of improperly having Paul Nelson ousted as the beneficiary of Winter's estate, and they claimed ownership of his music rights.",
      "After a seven-day trial before a judge in January 2024, Judge Trial Referee Charles Lee ruled Friday that the Nelsons received improper payments and made improper withdrawals from Winter's accounts, but rejected claims they committed fraud, mismanagement and breach of contract.",
      "\u201cThe court finds that the conduct for which it has awarded the damages set forth above was negligent or at least arguably legitimate,\u201d Lee wrote in a 54-page decision that also rejected the claims in the Nelsons' countersuit.",
      "The judge said the Nelsons' most serious impropriety was withdrawing $112,000 from Winter's business account and depositing it into one of their own accounts in 2019, without listing Susan Winter as a signatory on their account. Susan Winter owned all of her husband's assets \u2014 valued at about $3 million at the time of his death. The judge said punitive damages may be imposed on the Nelsons because of that transfer.",
      "Paul Nelson, who managed Johnny Winter's business from 2005 to 2019 and played guitar in his band, died in March 2024 from a heart attack during a music tour. Marion Nelson, who did bookkeeping for the Winters and the music business, did not immediately return an email message Monday. The Nelsons' lawyers did not immediately return phone and email messages. It wasn't clear if they planned to appeal.",
      "Susan Winter died from lung cancer in October 2019. Months before her death, she removed Paul Nelson as her successor trustee to her family trust, which included all of her late husband's assets. She named her sister and brother, Bonnie and Christopher Warford, from Charlotte, North Carolina, as her new successor trustees, and they sued the Nelsons.",
      "The Warfords' lawyers did not immediately return phone and email messages Monday. Phone numbers for the Warfords listed in public records were no longer in service.",
      "The Nelsons claimed the Warfords took advantage of Susan Winter and had her sign legal documents while she was medicated near the end of her life. They also alleged the Warfords soured their relationship with Susan Winter with false embezzlement claims. The Warfords denied those allegations.",
      "The judge ruled that the Warfords were entitled to damages because of improper payments the Nelsons received, including $68,000 in royalty payments from a 2016 auction of Winter's assets, $69,000 in cash withdrawals, $18,000 in expense reimbursements and $15,000 in other royalty payments.",
      "The Warfords also were awarded $56,000 that remains in one of the Nelsons' accounts, the same account used in the $112,000 transfer criticized by the judge. In 2020, the Nelsons transferred about $151,000 out of that account to the Warfords\u2019 lawyers.",
      "Lee also rejected claims by the Warfords that Paul Nelson should not have received $300,000 in auction proceeds from the sale of three of Johnny Winter's guitars, because Winter promised those guitars to Paul Nelson.",
      "John Dawson Winter III was born and raised in Beaumont, Texas. He burst onto the world blues scene in the 1960s, dazzling crowds with his fast licks while his trademark long, white hair flew about from under his cowboy hat. He and his brother Edgar \u2014 both born with albinism \u2014 were both renowned musicians. Johnny Winter, who played at Woodstock in 1969, was inducted into the Blues Foundation Hall of Fame in 1988.",
      "Rolling Stone magazine listed him as the No. 63 best guitar player of all time in 2015. He released more than two dozen albums and was nominated for several Grammy Awards, winning his first one posthumously in 2015 for Best Blues Album for \u201cStep Back.\u201d Nelson produced the album and also took home a Grammy for it.",
      "Johnny Winter, who spent two decades living in Easton, Connecticut, before his death, battled heroin addiction for years and credited Nelson, whom he met in 1999, with helping him get off the opioid methadone and revive his career, according to the 2014 documentary, \u201cJohnny Winter: Down & Dirty.\u201d",

      "Trailblazing ballerina Misty Copeland has decided to move on to what she calls \u201cthe next stage\u201d in her career",
      "NEW YORK -- Ten years ago this month, Misty Copeland sat in front of a hastily arranged news conference at American Ballet Theatre, fighting back tears of pride over her new role: principal dancer.",
      "\u201cThis is it,\u201d she said, with emotion. \u201cThis has been my dream since I was 13.\u201d",
      "The occasion was highly unusual \u2014 normally, when a dancer is promoted, a brief press release is issued. But this was Copeland, a crossover star with fame far beyond the insular world of ballet. And now she was becoming the first Black female principal in the company\u2019s 75-year history \u2014 just days after her New York debut as the lead in \u201cSwan Lake\u201d brought a refreshingly diverse, packed audience to the Metropolitan Opera House.",
      "Now, a decade and many accomplishments later, Copeland is retiring from the company she joined as a teenager.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s been 25 years at ABT, and I think it\u2019s time,\u201d Copeland, 42, told the Associated Press last week ahead of Monday\u2019s official announcement of her move. \u201cIt\u2019s time for me to move to the next stage.\u201d",
      "The company is planning a splashy farewell on Oct. 22, featuring performances by Copeland \u2014 for the first time in five years \u2014 and other dancers. There will be speeches and film clips. And Copeland, who's been heavily involved in the planning, will get a chance to venture one more time onto that balcony in Verona; she\u2019ll dance again in the beautiful \u201cRomeo and Juliet\u201d pas de deux. Honorary chairs for the evening will be Caroline Kennedy and Oprah Winfrey.",
      "A lot has happened in a quarter-century. Copeland, whose success brought new energy to an art form that has always been overwhelmingly white, has authored a number of books, including a memoir and and several works for young people. The second installment of \u201cBunheads\u201d arrives in September, and more are already planned in a series she calls \u201ca reflection of my journey, showing the range of cultures and types of people that can be a part of the ballet world.\u201d",
      "Copeland has also made a short film with her production company. And her philanthropic organization, The Misty Copeland Foundation, works on increasing diversity in the dance world and giving more kids who grew up economically disadvantaged, like she did, the chance to dance.",
      "\u201cIt was so important for children growing up and seeing somebody like Misty and saying, \u2018Oh my gosh, she looks like I do,\u2019\u201d says Susan Jaffe, ABT\u2019s artistic director, who is overseeing the farewell performance. \u201cThrough her books, through her lectures, even her endorsements, she has really been a trailblazer.\"",
      "Still, progress moves slowly. When Copeland exits ABT, there will no longer be a Black female principal dancer at the company \u2014 nor at many ballet companies around the globe. Copeland discussed that continued challenge in the dance world, among other topics, in the AP interview last week. Remarks have been edited for clarity and brevity.",
      "COPELAND: You know, I\u2019ve become the person that I am today, and have all the opportunities I have today, because of ballet, (and) because of American Ballet Theatre. I feel like this is me saying thank you to the company. So it\u2019s a farewell. (But) it won\u2019t be the end of me dancing. \u2026 Never say never.",
      "COPELAND: I\u2019ve noticed that the conversation is not something we shy away from anymore in terms of the lack of equity, the lack of diversity in this (dance) world. That\u2019s one of the biggest shifts I\u2019ve seen \u2026 a lot of young people that just can imagine being part of it in some way. They can imagine stepping into Lincoln Center and being at the Metropolitan Opera House.",
      "COPELAND: It's definitely concerning, and I think I\u2019ve just gotten to a place in my career where there\u2019s only so much I can do on a stage. There\u2019s only so much that visual representation like that can do. I feel like it\u2019s the perfect timing for me to be stepping into a new role, and hopefully still shaping and shifting the ballet world and culture.",
      "COPELAND: I think about my partnership with (former ABT principal) Roberto Bolle and him giving me so many opportunities to travel the world with him \u2026 (Former ABT principal) Marcelo Gomes, he\u2019s been such a such a big part of my journey, and of course Herman Cornejo. We\u2019ve had a beautiful partnership throughout my career and I\u2019m excited to dance with him again (at the October farewell,)",
      "COPELAND: It\u2019s made me even more patient. I just have a lighter and brighter outlook on life because it\u2019s just such an incredible thing to experience and witness... I think ballet has prepared me for being a mother in so many ways. I think it\u2019s ... prepared me for life and being resilient and patient and sensitive and empathetic and strong, and all of these things.",
      "COPELAND: He doesn\u2019t understand at all! (laughs) He\u2019s seen very little of me dancing. \u2026 But he\u2019s very drawn to it. He is a mover. He\u2019s very athletic. He is so drawn to music. He started violin on Monday. We live in the museums. He really is drawn to art. I think he\u2019s definitely on the artist\u2019s track.",
      "COPELAND: It\u2019s been pretty evenly split between all of then. I think it just depends on what\u2019s at the forefront and what needs my focus. ... But it\u2019s exciting to be able to utilize dance in so many different mediums, and to me, that\u2019s how you get true diversity \u2014 by giving people different entry points into learning about dance and feeling like they can be a part of it, which has been my goal. How do I bring dance to as many people as possible in a way that really works for them?",
      "COPELAND: It\u2019s a difficult time. And I think all we can really do is keep our heads down and keep doing the work. \u2026 we\u2019re fortunate in that way that we\u2019ve built great relationships and can continue to do the work right now through my foundation. There\u2019s no way to stop the people that feel passionate about this work. We will continue doing it. It is so necessary for the well-being of our societies and communities. I think there are times to speak out and yell from the rooftops. And for me, I feel like this is a time to keep my head down and really stay focused and do the work.",

      "NEW YORK -- Even the ushers at Radio City Music Hall seemed thrilled to be in the room where it happened.",
      "A few of them could be seen grooving, like everyone else at Sunday\u2019s Tony Awards, to the \u201cHamilton\u201d reunion performance \u2014 a medley of some of that blockbuster musical\u2019s biggest songs, performed by the original cast. The occasion was the 10th Broadway anniversary of Lin-Manuel Miranda\u2019s juggernaut that spawned multiple touring companies, a West End production and a live-capture film \u2014 and is still going strong.",
      "But while the theater was buzzing to songs like \u201cMy Shot,\u201d \u201cThe Schuyler Sisters,\u201d \u201cHistory Has Its Eyes on You\u201d and \u201cThe Room Where It Happens,\u201d some people were unfortunately NOT in the room where, er, it was happening. They were the ones who\u2019d taken a trip to the bar or a stroll around the lobby, and were then held from entering until the next commercial break \u2014 missing perhaps the night\u2019s most anticipated highlight.",
      "They also missed the entire audience singing along with Jonathan Groff, aka King George, \u201cDa-da-da, dat-da, dat, da-da-da, da-ya-da, Da-da, dat, dat, da-ya-da.\u201d Note for next year: Exit at your own peril!",
      "Some other notable moments from Tony night:",
      "Most award winners thank Mom, their agents, their co-stars and their spouses.",
      "Cole Escola, one of the major stars of this Tony night, promised Mom a call, but also decided to thank \u201cTeebo from Grindr\u201d \u2014 the dating app \u2014 when accepting the award for lead actor in a play.",
      "Escola is star and writer of the riotous \u201cOh, Mary!\u201d \u2014 a reimagining of the life of Mary Todd Lincoln (and her beleaguered husband, Abe) that addresses the question: What if the Lincoln assassination wasn\u2019t such a bad thing for Mary? (Mary wants to be a cabaret star, you see.) The show is seeing audiences collapse in laughter for 80 minutes every night on Broadway.",
      "Escola, a downtown cabaret star, beat out high-wattage competitors like George Clooney and Daniel Dae Kim for the acting award. They mentioned their co-nominees in their speech, saying they had enjoyed sharing \u201cwarm salads\u201d at pre-awards lunches.",
      "Escola is the first nonbinary actor to win a Tony in the category.",
      "When \u201cMaybe Happy Ending\u201d writers Hue Park and Will Aronson accepted the award for best book of a musical, the first handed out, Park felt it necessary to point out that they weren\u2019t an actual couple. \u201cI am very much single,\u201d he clarified, for anyone wondering.",
      "Then later, when the duo won for best score, Park deemed a reminder necessary: \u201cBy the way, I\u2019m still single.\u201d",
      "And then at the end of the night, \u201cMaybe Happy Ending,\u201d the charming and quirky romance between decommissioned robots in a futuristic Korea, won the big prize: best musical. Park did not get the mic. But producer Jeffrey Richards did, and he reminded the crowd: \u201cHue is still single.\u201d",
      "Cynthia Erivo, the \u201cWicked\u201d star and powerhouse vocalist hosting the evening, said it first: \u201cAs they apparently say in a very fertile piece of intellectual property,\" she said with a wink, \u201cthere\u2019s no place like home. And Broadway has always been mine.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s a familiar theme on Tony night: the theater community as a welcoming haven for those who may feel different or unseen. It was echoed by Harvey Fierstein, winner of a lifetime achievement award, describing how he joined the theater after being welcomed by a company in Brooklyn. And it was expressed very emotionally by Nicole Scherzinger, winning best actress in a musical for \u201cSunset Blvd.\u201d",
      "\u201cGrowing up, I always felt like I didn\u2019t belong,\u201d said Scherzinger, former lead singer of the pop group Pussycat Dolls who plays Norma Desmond in the minimalist version of the Andrew Lloyd Webber show. \u201cBut you all have made me feel like I belong, and I have come home at last.\u201d Those last words echo the lyrics of one of Desmond\u2019s big numbers, \u201cAs If We Never Said Goodbye.\u201d",
      "\u201cSo if there\u2019s anyone out there who feels like they don\u2019t belong, or your time hasn\u2019t come, don\u2019t give up,\u201d Scherzinger continued. \u201cJust keep on giving and giving because the world needs your love and your light now more than ever.\u201d",
      "There\u2019s always lots of chatter going on during an awards show. But the way the crowd quieted down during Audra McDonald\u2019s powerful, agonized performance of \u201cRose\u2019s Turn\u201d from \u201cGypsy\u201d was striking. In the song's quiet moments, you heard utter silence in the vast room.",
      "McDonald, the Tonys' most awarded actor, is clearly revered by the theater community, who cheered her with standing ovations. But the award she was up for went to Scherzinger.",
      "It\u2019s been two years since HBO\u2019s \u201cSuccession\u201d ended, but its stars keep turning up at awards shows \u2014 and often winning. Jeremy Strong won a Tony last year and was nominated for an Oscar this year. Kieran Culkin won an Oscar this year and is appearing on Broadway this season, though he wasn\u2019t nominated. And now it was the turn of Sarah Snook \u2014 Emmy and Golden Globe winner \u2014 to win a Tony.",
      "Snook, who played mercurial sibling Shiv Roy in the series, took the Tony for best actress in a play for \u201cThe Picture of Dorian Gray,\u201d in which she plays all 26 roles.",
      "Tony winner and musical theater regular Gavin Creel, who died last year of cancer, was a friend to many in the theater community, and was remembered more than once on Tony evening.",
      "During the early pre-show, actor Celia Keenan-Bolger was honored with the Isabelle Stevenson award, for her advocacy work in the arts. She spoke movingly of her deep friendship with Creel and their advocacy work together.",
      "Later, singer and actor Sara Bareilles performed a soulful duet of \u201cTomorrow\u201d from \u201cAnnie,\u201d harmonizing with Erivo, during the memorial segment. That segment ended with a photo of Creel, also a dear friend to Bareilles, who teared up.",
      "Both Bareilles and Keenan-Bolger are involved with the Gavin Creel Fellowship, an initiative that plans to provide $25,000 grants to five emerging theater actors each year.",
      "The final award had been announced by presenter Miranda \u2014 best musical to \u201cMaybe Happy Ending\u201d \u2014 and the audience started to disperse. But Erivo had another idea.",
      "Riffing on the concept of leaving, she launched into the famous \u201cDreamgirls\u201d ballad \u201cAnd I Am Telling You I\u2019m Not Going\u201d \u2014 with rewritten lyrics.",
      "It was a yet another powerhouse performance from someone who has one of the best voices on the planet. The audience stopped dispersing \u2014 and started cheering.",

      "The night delivered a stirring mix of purpose and entertainment from Doechii 's powerful speech, Jamie Foxx 's emotional reflection and Kevin Hart 's sharp comedic opener.",
      "Doechii made her presence felt early during the five-hour ceremony, using her acceptance speech for best female hip-hop artist to draw attention to the immigration raids and protest crackdowns taking place just miles from the venue. Her message added urgency and depth to a ceremony meant to honor both Black excellence and social impact.",
      "After being named best female hip-hop artist \u2014 her first-ever BET Award \u2014 Doechii acknowledged her fellow nominees, then shifted the spotlight to the issues unfolding outside the venue.",
      "\u201cThere are ruthless attacks that are creating fear and chaos in our communities in the name of law and order,\u201d said Doechii, who won a Grammy for best rap album, only the third woman to win in that category.",
      "\u201cTrump is using military forces to stop a protest,\u201d she said. \u201cI want you all to consider what kind of government it appears to be when every time we exercise our democratic right to protest, the military is deployed against us. What type of government is that?\u201d",
      "Doechii\u2019s words drew applause from the audience at the Peacock Theater, where the awards aired live.",
      "\u201cPeople are being swept up and torn from their families,\u201d she continued. \u201cI feel like it\u2019s my responsibility as an artist to use this moment to speak up for all oppressed people. \u2026 We all deserve to live in hope and not fear. I hope we stand together.\u201d",
      "Foxx, Mariah Carey, Snoop Dogg and Kirk Franklin received the Ultimate Icon Award. They were selected due to their impact on entertainment as well as their community impact and advocacy.",
      "Foxx was the first to receive his award. He was visibly moved during a heartfelt moment at the awards, being brought to tears while accepting his trophy after surviving a life-threatening health scare in recent years.",
      "The Oscar and Grammy winner reflected on watching the in memoriam tribute from his seat.",
      "\u201cWhen I saw the memoriam, I was like, \u2018Man, that could\u2019ve been me,\u2019\u201d said Foxx, who was hospitalized in 2023 after suffering a stroke. In an interview with The Associated Press, he recalled the severity of the moment: \u201cThe thing was almost a wrap. Every prayer counted.\u201d",
      "Foxx was presented the award by music legend Stevie Wonder, adding even more weight to the emotional moment. As he stood on stage, his voice cracked with gratitude.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know why I went through what I went through. But I know my second chance \u2014 I won\u2019t turn it down,\u201d Foxx said, as his two daughters and sister wiped away tears from the audience. \u201cI have so much love to give. Just give me one more crack at this. Whatever reason you put this on me, I promise I\u2019ll do right. \u2026 You can\u2019t go through something like that and not testify.\u201d",
      "Carey said this was her first time collecting a trophy at the BET Awards. The singer said she became emotional after Busta Rhymes introduced her.",
      "\u201cIt took me a while, but I finally realized that life is far too short to live for anyone else's approval, which is something I always did,\u201d said Carey, a five-time Grammy winner. \u201cI decided to own who I am.\u201d",
      "Dr. Dre presented the award to Snoop, who walked onstage with his wife Shante Taylor. In his speech, he paid homage to Carey, Franklin and Foxx before thanking the many others who helped him throughout his life.",
      "\u201cHip-hop gave me a voice. It gave me a purpose,\u201d he said. \u201cIt gave me a way out and a way into homes, hearts, cultures and countries I'd never thought I would even touch. Being an icon isn't about fame. It's about legacy. It's about what you build, what you leave behind and who you lift up along the way.\u201d",
      "Franklin expressed gratitude for the honor, admitting he\u2019s far from the perfect Christian, husband, father or artist. He joked, \u201cI can\u2019t even sing.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhich makes this award so amazing, because what I do really don\u2019t make sense,\" he said. \"If you\u2019re listening to this, that\u2019s when you know it\u2019s God.\u201d",

      "Hart paid tribute to Foxx and teased gospel star Franklin.",
      "\u201cWhen you get your award tonight, don\u2019t come up here front twerking,\u201d Hart said, as the crowd erupted in laughter.",
      "The jab was a nod to Franklin\u2019s viral moment when he playfully twerked on gospel legend Jacky Clark Chisholm during a live performance.",
      "\u201cDon\u2019t come up here poppin\u2019,\u201d Hart added, as cameras caught Franklin bowing his head and chuckling. \u201cDon\u2019t try to blame it on the Lord. The Lord didn\u2019t ask for that. Put it away, Kirk.\u201d",
      "Kendrick Lamar took home the award for his critically acclaimed project \u201cGNX.\u201d",
      "Lamar made waves with his Grammy triumph, winning song and record of the year for \u201cNot Like Us.\u201d He followed up with a groundbreaking halftime show, becoming the first solo hip-hop performer to headline the coveted slot. The rap megastar is currently on the Grand National Tour with SZA.",
      "Lil Wayne, GloRilla, Amerie, Jim Jones and Teyana Taylor were some of the performers who hit the stage. Other performers included Babyface, Ludacris, Tank, Jennifer Hudson, Teddy Riley, T-Pain, Doug E. Fresh, Craig Robinson, Playboi Carti and singer Leon Thomas.",

      "Most big collections have only a fraction of their items on display, with the rest locked away in storage",
      "LONDON -- A museum is like an iceberg. Most of it is out of sight.",
      "Most big collections have only a fraction of their items on display, with the rest locked away in storage. But not at the new V&A East Storehouse, where London\u2019s Victoria and Albert Museum has opened up its storerooms for visitors to view \u2014 and in many cases touch \u2014 the items within.",
      "The 16,000-square-meter (170,000-square-foot) building, bigger than 30 basketball courts, holds more than 250,000 objects, 350,000 books and 1,000 archives. Wandering its huge, three-story collections hall feels like a trip to IKEA, but with treasures at every turn.",
      "The V&A is Britain\u2019s national museum of design, performance and applied arts, and the storehouse holds aisle after aisle of open shelves lined with everything from ancient Egyptian shoes to Roman pottery, ancient Indian sculptures, Japanese armor, Modernist furniture, a Piaggio scooter and a brightly painted garbage can from the Glastonbury Festival.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s 5,000 years of creativity,\u201d said Kate Parsons, the museum\u2019s director of collection care and access. It took more than a year, and 379 truckloads, to move the objects from the museum\u2019s former storage facility in west London to the new site.",
      "In the museum\u2019s biggest innovation, anyone can book a one-on-one appointment with any object, from a Vivienne Westwood mohair sweater to a tiny Japanese netsuke figurine. Most of the items can even be handled, with exceptions for hazardous materials, such as Victorian wallpaper that contains arsenic.",
      "The Order an Object service offers \u201ca behind-the-scenes, very personal, close interaction\u201d with the collection, Parsons said as she showed off one of the most requested items so far: a 1954 pink silk taffeta Balenciaga evening gown. Nearby in one of the study rooms were a Bob Mackie-designed military tunic worn by Elton John on his 1981 world tour and two silk kimonos laid out ready for a visit.",
      "Parsons said there has been \u201ca phenomenal response\u201d from the public since the building opened at the end of May. Visitors have ranged from people seeking inspiration for their weddings to art students and \u201csomeone last week who was using equipment to measure the thread count of an 1850 dress.\u201d She says strangers who have come to view different objects often strike up conversations.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s just wonderful,\u201d Parsons said. \u201cYou never quite know. \u2026 We have this entirely new concept and of course we hope and we believe and we do audience research and we think that people are going to come. But until they actually did, and came through the doors, we didn\u2019t know.\u201d",
      "The V&A\u2019s flagship museum in London\u2019s affluent South Kensington district, founded in the 1850s, is one of Britain\u2019s biggest tourist attractions. The Storehouse is across town in the Olympic Park, a post-industrial swath of east London that hosted the 2012 summer games.",
      "As part of post-Olympic regeneration, the area is now home to a new cultural quarter that includes arts and fashion colleges, a dance theater and another V&A branch, due to open next year. The Storehouse has hired dozens of young people recruited from the surrounding area, which includes some of London\u2019s most deprived districts.",
      "Designed by Diller, Scofidio and Renfro, the firm behind New York\u2019s High Line park, the building has space to show off objects too big to have been displayed very often before, including a 17th-century Mughal colonnade from India, a 1930s modernist office designed by Frank Lloyd Wright and a Pablo Picasso-designed stage curtain for a 1924 ballet, some 10 meters (more than 30 feet) high.",
      "Also on a monumental scale are large chunks of vanished buildings, including a gilded 15th-century ceiling from the Torrijos Palace in Spain and a slab of the concrete fa\u00e7ade of Robin Hood Gardens, a demolished London housing estate.",
      "Not a hushed temple of art, this is a working facility. Conversation is encouraged and forklifts beep in the background. Workers are finishing the David Bowie Center, a home for the late London-born musician\u2019s archive of costumes, musical instruments, letters, lyrics and photos that is due to open at the Storehouse in September.",
      "One aim of the Storehouse is to expose the museum\u2019s inner workings, through displays delving into all aspects of the conservators\u2019 job \u2013 from the eternal battle against insects to the numbering system for museum contents \u2014 and a viewing gallery to watch staff at work.",
      "The increased openness comes as museums in the U.K. are under increasing scrutiny over the origins of their collections. They face pressure to return objects acquired in sometimes contested circumstances during the days of the British Empire",
      "Senior curator Georgia Haseldine said the V&A is adopting a policy of transparency, \u201cso that we can talk very openly about where things have come from, how they ended up in the V&A\u2019s collection, and also make sure that researchers, as well as local people and people visiting from all around the world, have free and equitable access to these objects.",
      "\u201cOn average, museums have one to five percent of their collections on show,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat we\u2019re doing here is saying, \u2018No, this whole collection belongs to all of us. This is a national collection and you should have access to it.\u2019 That is our fundamental principle.\u201d",

      "The panel of seven women and five men on Thursday began weighing two counts of criminal sex act and one count of rape against the former movie mogul. Weinstein, 73, has pleaded not guilty.",
      "On Friday, one juror asked to be removed from the case, saying he felt other jurors were treating one member of the panel in an \u201cunfair and unjust\u201d way. The judge told him he had to keep deliberating and also denied a defense request for a mistrial over the issue.",
      "Weinstein was originally found guilty in New York in 2020 of rape and sexual assault against two women in a verdict considered a landmark in the #MeToo movement.",
      "But the conviction was subsequently overturned, leading to his retrial \u2014 with an additional accuser added last year \u2014 before a new jury and a different judge.",

      "Filmmaker Dean DeBlois returns to the world of \u201cHow to Train Your Dragon\u201d for a new live-action adaptation, in theaters Friday",
      "Ever wanted to soar through the skies on the back of a friendly dragon? The new \u201cHow to Train Your Dragon\u201d may be the ticket, from a decidedly safer, though possibly still vertigo-inducing, distance.",
      "This live-action adaption of the underdog adventure story sends the audience cascading through the clouds with the teenage Viking boy Hiccup and his dragon friend Toothless. It\u2019s the kind of immersive sensation and giddy wish fulfillment that might just have you forgetting momentarily to breathe and, maybe more importantly, that you\u2019re still in a movie theater. Credit to veteran cinematographer Bill Pope, no stranger to fantasy worlds, whether it\u2019s \u201cThe Matrix\u201d or \u201cScott Pilgrim vs. The World.\u201d",
      "\u201cHow to Train Your Dragon\u201d doesn\u2019t stray far from the original, from shots to story beats. Gerard Butler once again plays Berk\u2019s Chief Stoick the Vast. The new Hiccup, actor Mason Thames, even sounds a bit like Jay Baruchel. But unlike so many live-action remakes of animated films, it also doesn\u2019t feel superfluous, or, worse, like a poor imitation of its predecessor that trades the magic of animation for photorealism.",
      "Perhaps that\u2019s because filmmaker Dean DeBlois, who made the three animated films, stayed in the director\u2019s chair. Who better to kill their darlings than the one who brought them to the screen in the first place? And, crucially, to know where live-action might actually enhance the fabric of the world created by author Cressida Cowell.",
      "It helps that dragon technology has come a long way since, say, \u201cDragonHeart.\u201d These fire-breathing CG creatures feel disarmingly real. And though it might look like \u201cLord of the Rings\u201d or \u201cGame of Thrones,\u201d the tone stays light enough for younger filmgoers. There are a few intense sequences, but none that takes it any further than the animated film did 15 years ago.",
      "\u201cHow to Train Your Dragon\u201d does start a little slow, however, which is odd because it also begins with a fiery battle between the Vikings and the dragons on the Isle of Berk. There\u2019s a lot of exposition and introduction that needs to happen before you can just give yourself over to the story. In this more multicultural version, the warriors on Berk have been recruited from tribes around the globe to try to defeat the dragons.",
      "Hiccup is a Viking nepo baby. As the chief's son, he sits in a place of privilege, but he\u2019s also a general outcast in this world of ruthless warriors \u2014 skinny and weak, he just longs to be part of the action, not sharpening the weapons. Killing dragons is currency in this society, and his crush Astrid (Nico Parker) happens to be one of the most promising up-and-comers. His sole champion is Gobber (a delightful Nick Frost), the blacksmith and dragon slayer teacher, who convinces the chief to give the clever Hiccup a shot.",
      "The film finds its internal engine when Hiccup finds Toothless, the wide-eyed \u201cNight Fury\u201d dragon whom he can\u2019t bring himself to kill. Instead, he decides to study this discovery, who he finds is not as nearly fearsome as everyone assumes. \u201cHow to Train Your Dragon\u201d teaches empathy and ingenuity without a sermon.",
      "Thames, a teenager himself, is the perfect embodiment of adolescent awkwardness and boldness. You can have all the cute dragons you want, but the audience would be lost if the human conduit to the relationship isn\u2019t up to the task. Butler seems to be having a good time, resplendent in fur and chest-thumping ideas about ancient duties. And Parker gives Astrid a relatable depth \u2014 the best in the bunch who is outshone in an unequal fight.",
      "Kids deserve movies that are made on the biggest possible canvas. \u201cHow to Train Your Dragon\u201d is one that's worth the trip to the theater. It might just spark some young imaginations, whether it\u2019s to go back and read the books or dream up their own worlds. And, chances are, no one is going to be yelling \u201cchicken jockey.\u201d",
      "\u201cHow to Train Your Dragon,\u201d a Universal Pictures release in theaters Friday, is rated PG by the Motion Picture Association for \u201csequences of intense action and peril.\u201d Running time: 125 minutes. Three and a half stars out of four.",

      "\u201cLilo & Stich\u201d has topped the domestic box office charts for a third weekend",
      "In the box office showdown between a deadly assassin and a chaotic CG alien, \u201cLilo & Stitch\u201d still had the edge. The Disney juggernaut celebrated a third weekend at the top of the charts, while the John Wick spinoff \u201cBallerina\u201d did not jet\u00e9 as high as expected.",
      "According to studio estimates Sunday, \u201cFrom the World of John Wick: Ballerina\u201d earned $25 million from 3,409 theaters in the U.S. and Canada. Several weeks ago it was tracking to open in the $35 to $40 million range, but that was adjusted down several times. Ultimately, it still came in lower than forecasts. The movie, directed by Len Wiseman, makes a sideline character out of Keanu Reeves\u2019 John Wick and focuses on Ana de Armas. It takes place during the events of \u201cJohn Wick 3.\u201d",
      "The box office performance is a bit perplexing result considering that \u201cBallerina\u201d got good critic reviews and audience exit polls. Conventional wisdom would say that word of mouth might have given it a boost over the weekend. But, recently, opening weekend isn\u2019t the end all that it used to be. \u201cBallerina\u201d could be in the game for the long haul.",
      "The Lionsgate release, a Thunder Road Films and 87Eleven Entertainment production, had a hefty production price tag reported to be in the $90 million range. But much of that cost has already been offset by foreign pre-sales. Internationally, it earned $26 million from 82 countries, bringing its global opening to $51 million.",
      "As the first spinoff, it\u2019s the second lowest opening of the five-film franchise \u2013 above only the first film which opened just over $14 million in 2014, which does not account for inflation. The franchise overall has grossed more than $1 billion worldwide.",
      "First place once again went to \u201cLilo & Stitch,\u201d which added another $32.5 million in North America, bringing its domestic total to $335.8 and global tally to $772.6 million. In just 17 days, it's already made more domestically than the live-action \u201cThe Little Mermaid\u201d did in its entire run ($298 million).",
      "\u201cMission: Impossible \u2014 The Final Reckoning\u201d slid to third place with $15 million, bringing its worldwide total to $450.4 million. \u201cKarate Kid: Legends\u201d earned $8.7 million to take fourth place. And \u201cFinal Destination: Bloodlines\" rounded out the top five with $6.5 million.",
      "The new Wes Anderson movie \u201cThe Phoenician Scheme\u201d expanded beyond New York and Los Angeles to 1,678 theaters nationwide. The Focus Features release starring Benicio del Toro made an estimated $6.3 million and landed in sixth place.",

    "story": [
      "Big changes are being are being proposed to a food aid program as part of President Donald Trump's tax-cut legislation",
      "TPresident Donald Trump's plan to cut taxes by trillions of dollars could also trim billions in spending from social safety net programs, including food aid for lower-income people.",
      "The proposed changes to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program would make states pick up more of the costs, require several million more recipients to work or lose their benefits, and potentially reduce the amount of food aid people receive in the future.",
      "The legislation, which narrowly passed the U.S. House, could undergo further changes in the Senate, where it's currently being debated. Trump wants lawmakers to send the \u201cOne Big Beautiful Bill Act\u201d to his desk by July 4, when the nation marks the 249th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence.",
      "Here's a look at the food aid program, by the numbers:",
      "The federal aid program formerly known as food stamps was renamed the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, on Oct. 1, 2008. The program provides monthly payments for food purchases to low-income residents generally earning less than $1,632 monthly for individuals, or $3,380 monthly for a household of four.",
      "The nation\u2019s first experiment with food stamps began in 1939. But the modern version of the program dates to 1979, when a change in federal law took effect eliminating a requirement that participants purchase food stamps. There currently is no cost to people participating in the program.",
      "A little over 42 million people nationwide received SNAP benefits in February, the latest month for which figures are available. That's roughly one out of every eight people in the county. Participation is down from a peak average of 47.6 million people during the 2013 federal fiscal year.",
      "Often, more than one person in a household is eligible for food aid. As of February, nearly 22.5 million households were enrolled SNAP, receiving an average monthly household benefit of $353.",
      "Legislation passed by the House is projected to cut about $295 billion of federal spending from SNAP over the next 10 years, according to the Congressional Budget Office.",
      "A little more than half of those federal savings would come by shifting costs to states, which administer SNAP. Nearly one-third of those savings would come by expanding a work requirement for some SNAP participants, which the CBO assumes would force some people off the rolls. Additional money would be saved by eliminating SNAP benefits for between 120,000 and 250,000 immigrants legally in the U.S. who are not citizens or lawful permanent residents.",
      "Another provision in the legislation would cap the annual inflationary growth in food benefits. As a result, the CBO estimates that the average monthly food benefit would be about $15 lower than it otherwise would have been by 2034.",
      "To receive SNAP benefits, current law says adults ages 18 through 54 who are physically and mentally able and don\u2019t have dependents would need to work, volunteer or participate in training programs for at least 80 hours a month. Those who don't do so are limited to just three months of benefits in a three-year period.",
      "The legislation that passed the House would expand work requirements to those ages 55 through 64. It also would extend work requirements to some parents without children younger than age 7. And it would limit the ability of states to waive work requirements in areas that lack sufficient jobs.",
      "The combined effect of those changes is projected by the CBO to reduce SNAP participation by a monthly average of 3.2 million people.",
      "The federal government currently splits the administrative costs of SNAP with states but covers the full cost of food benefits. Under the legislation, states would have to cover three-fourths of the administrative costs. States also would have to pay a portion of the food benefits starting with the 2028 fiscal year.",
      "All states would be required to pay at least 5% of the food aid benefits, and could pay more depending on how often they make mistakes with people\u2019s payments.",
      "States that had payment error rates between 6-8% in the most recent federal fiscal year for which data is available would have to cover 15% of the food costs. States with error rates between 8-10% would have to cover 20% of the food benefits, and those with error rates greater than 10% would have to cover 25% of the food costs.",
      "Many states could get hit with higher costs. The national error rate stood at 11.7% in the 2023 fiscal year, and just three states \u2014 Idaho, South Dakota and Vermont \u2014 had error rates below 5%. But the 2023 figures are unlikely to serve as the base year, so the exact costs to states remains unclear.",
      "As a result of the cost shift, the CBO assumes that some states would reduce or eliminate benefits for people.",
      "House Resolution 1, containing the SNAP changes and tax cuts, passed the House last month by a margin of just one vote \u2014 215-214.",
      "A vote also could be close in the Senate, where Republicans hold 53 of the 100 seats. Democrats did not support the bill in the House and are unlikely to do so in the Senate. Some Republican senators have expressed reservations about proposed cuts to food aid and Medicaid and the potential impact of the bill on the federal deficit. GOP Senate leaders may have to make some changes to the bill to ensure enough support to pass it.",

      "A top aide to Health Secretary Robert F",
      "WASHINGTON -- Calley Means has built a following within the \u201cMake America Healthy Again\u201d movement by railing against the failings of the U.S. health system, often pinning the blame on one issue: corruption.",
      "Means, a top aide to Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., was hired as a White House adviser in March. He has used that perch to attack the nation\u2019s leading physician groups, federal agencies and government scientists, claiming they only protect their own interests in the nation\u2019s $4.9 trillion-a-year industry.",
      "In recent interviews, speeches and podcasts he has called the American Medical Association \u201ca pharma lobbying group,\u201d labeled the Food and Drug Administration \u201ca sock puppet of industry,\" and said federal health scientists have \u201coverseen a record of utter failure.\u201d",
      "Means, however, has his own financial stake in the sprawling health system. He\u2019s the co-founder of an online platform, Truemed, that offers dietary supplements, herbal remedies and other wellness products. Some of the vendors featured on Truemed\u2019s website are supporters of Kennedy\u2019s MAHA movement, which downplays the benefits of prescription drugs, vaccines and other rigorously tested medical products.",
      "Kennedy has pledged to run the Department of Health and Human Services with \u201cradical transparency,\u201d but Means has never had to publicly disclose his own financial details or where exactly they intersect with the policies he's advancing.",
      "\u201cIt reeks of hypocrisy,\u201d said Dr. Reshma Ramachandran, a health researcher at Yale University. \u201cIn effect, he is representing another industry that is touting nonregulated products and using his platform within the government to financially benefit himself.\u201d",
      "In a written statement, Means said his government work has not dealt with matters affecting Truemed and has focused on issues like reforming nutrition programs and pressuring companies to phase out food dyes.",
      "\u201cPursuing these large-scale MAHA goals to make America healthy has been the sole focus in my government work,\u201d Means said.",
      "Truemed helps users take tax-free money out of their health savings accounts, or HSAs, to spend on things that wouldn\u2019t normally qualify as medical expenses, such as exercise equipment, meal delivery services and homeopathic remedies \u2014 mixtures of plants and minerals based on a centuries-old theory of medicine that's not supported by modern science.",
      "The business model caught the attention of the IRS last year, which issued an alert: \u201cBeware of companies misrepresenting nutrition, wellness and general health expenses as medical care.\u201d",
      "Truemed co-founder and CEO, Justin Mares, said in a statement the company is \u201cin full alignment\u201d with IRS guidelines.",
      "\u201cTruemed enables patients to work with providers to use medical funds for root cause interventions like exercise and vitamin D to reverse disease under current law,\u201d Mares said.",
      "The full extent of Means\u2019 potential conflicts \u2014 including his personal investments\u2014 are unclear because of his status as a special government employee.",
      "Unlike presidential appointees and other senior officials, special government employees are temporary staffers who do not have to leave companies or sell investments that could be impacted by their work. Also, their financial disclosure forms are shielded from public release.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a big problem,\u201d says Richard Painter, a former White House ethics lawyer under George W. Bush now at the University of Minnesota. Painter and other experts have raised alarms over a whirlwind of Trump administration actions to dismantle the government\u2019s public integrity guardrails.",
      "Still, part-time government employees are subject to the same law that bars all federal staffers from working on issues that could directly benefit their finances. When such cases arise, they must recuse themselves or risk criminal penalties.",
      "Means regularly opines on matters before HHS, including rethinking the use of drugs for depression, weight loss, diabetes and other conditions. Recently he's been promoting a new government report that calls for scaling back prescription medications in favor of exercise, dietary changes and other alternatives.",
      "\u201cIf we rely less on our medical system, less on drugs, it necessitates the spiritual, cultural conversation about what we\u2019re doing to our children\u2019s bodies,\u201d Means said in a recent podcast appearance.",
      "Experts note that government ethics rules are intended to both prevent financial conflict violations, but also the appearance of such conflicts that might undermine public trust in government.",
      "\u201cIf I were running the ethics office over at HHS, I sure as heck wouldn\u2019t want anybody going around giving interviews and speeches about government matters that could have an effect on their own financial interests,\u201d Painter said.",
      "Means\u2019 rapid rise reflects the seeming contradictions within the MAHA movement itself, which urges followers to distrust both big corporations and the government agencies which regulate them.",
      "Means rails against big pharma and food conglomerates, two industries that he says he spent years working for as a consultant in Washington.",
      "Means has no medical training. A graduate of Harvard Business School, he previously ran a bridal gown startup with his wife. On Wednesday, he's scheduled to be the keynote speaker at FDA's annual science forum, according to a copy of the program shared with The Associated Press.",
      "He traces his passion for health care reform to the death of his mother from pancreatic cancer in 2021. Shortly thereafter, Means and his sister, Dr. Casey Means, took psychedelics together and had \u201ca mind-blowing, life-changing experience,\u201d which led them to co-author a wellness book, launch separate health startups and begin appearing on podcasts.",
      "Casey Means was recently nominated to be surgeon general and has faced scrutiny over her qualifications, including an unfinished medical residency.",
      "Asked about her nomination, President Donald Trump said: \u201cBobby thought she was fantastic,\u201d adding that he did not know her.",
      "Meanwhile, her brother has stepped up his rhetoric for the MAHA agenda, recently declaring that Kennedy has \u201ca spiritual mandate to reform our broken system.\"",
      "While promoting the administration\u2019s accomplishments, Means does not shy away from plugging his own brand or those of his business partners.",
      "When asked to offer health advice to listeners of a sports podcast, Outkick The Show, in April, Means said: \u201cRead our book, \u2018Good Energy.\u2019\u201d",
      "He also recommended blood tests sold by Function Health, which provides subscription-based testing for $500 annually. The company was cofounded by Dr. Mark Hyman, a friend of Kennedy and an investor in Truemed, which also offers Hyman's supplements through its platform. Casey Means is also an investor in Hyman's company.",
      "\u201cIf you\u2019re sick, most likely you have some kind of nutrient deficiency, some kind of biomarker that you can actually then target with your diet and your supplements,\u201d Calley Means said.",
      "Like dietary supplements, the marketing claims on laboratory tests sold by Hyman are not approved by the FDA. The agency has warned for years about the accuracy of such tests and tried to start regulating them under President Joe Biden.",
      "Experts say MAHA entrepreneurs like Hyman are following a playbook common to the wellness industry: Identify a health concern, market a test to diagnose it and then sell supplements or other remedies to treat it.",
      "\u201cIt ends up favoring these products and services that rest on flimsy grounds, at the expense of products that have actually survived a rigorous FDA approval process,\u201d said Dr. Peter Lurie, a former FDA official who is now president of the Center for Science in the Public Interest.",
      "Many of the items sold via Truemed, including sweat tents, cold plunge tanks and light therapy lamps, wouldn\u2019t typically qualify as medical expenses under rules for HSAs, tax-free accounts created by Congress to manage medical costs.",
      "The IRS generally states that HSA purchases must help diagnose, cure, treat, mitigate or prevent disease.",
      "Truemed allows users to request a \u201cletter of medical necessity\u201d from a doctor, stating that the product in question could have medical value for them. Like other telehealth services, there\u2019s usually no real-time communication with the patient. The physician reviews a \u201csimple survey solution,\u201d filled out by the Truemed user, according to the company\u2019s website.",
      "Industry representatives say customers should be careful.",
      "\u201cYou need to be prepared to defend your spending habits under audit,\u201d said Kevin McKechnie, head of the American Bankers Association\u2019s HSA council. \u201cCompanies are popping up suggesting they can help you manage that process and maybe they can \u2014 so the debate continues.\u201d",
      "Americans have an estimated $147 billion in HSA accounts, a potential windfall for companies like Truemed that collects fees for transactions made using their platforms.",
      "Means sees an even bigger opportunity \u2014 routing federal funds out of government programs and into more HSAs.",
      "\u201cThe point of our company is to steer medical dollars into flexible spending,\u201d Means told fitness celebrity Jillian Michaels, on her podcast last year. \u201cI want to get that $4.5 trillion of Medicare, Medicaid, everything into a flexible account.\u201d",
      "Means\u2019 pitch for expanding HSAs echoes two decades of Republican talking points on the accounts, which were created in 2003 to encourage Americans in high-deductible plans to be judicious with their health dollars.",
      "But HSAs have not brought down spending, economists say. They are disproportionately used by the wealthiest Americans, who have more income to fund them and a bigger incentive to lower their tax rate.",
      "Americans who earn more than $1 million annually are the group most likely to make regular HSA contributions, according to an analysis by the nonprofit Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. More than half Americans with HSAs have balances less than $500.",
      "Trump\u2019s \u201cOne Big Beautiful Bill\u201d would further expand HSA purchases, making gym memberships and other fitness expenses eligible for tax-free spending. That provision alone is expected to cost the government $10 billion in revenue.",
      "\u201cThese are really just tax breaks in the guise of health policy that overwhelmingly benefit people with high incomes,\u201d said Gideon Lukens, a former White House budget official during the Obama and Trump administrations, now with the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.",

      "President Donald Trump\u2019s National Institutes of Health director says some employees\u2019 critical letter to him has \u201cfundamental misconceptions about the policy directions the NIH has taken.\u201d",
      "WASHINGTON -- In his confirmation hearings to lead the National Institutes of Health, Jay Bhattacharya pledged his openness to views that might conflict with his own. \u201cDissent,\" he said, \u201dis the very essence of science.\u201d",
      "That commitment is being put to the test.",
      "On Monday, scores of scientists at the agency sent their Trump-appointed leader a letter titled the Bethesda Declaration, challenging \u201cpolicies that undermine the NIH mission, waste public resources, and harm the health of Americans and people across the globe.\u201d",
      "It says: \"We dissent.\"",
      "In a capital where insiders often insist on anonymity to say such things publicly, 92 NIH researchers, program directors, branch chiefs and scientific review officers put their signatures on the letter \u2014 and their careers on the line. An additional 250 of their colleagues across the agency endorsed the declaration without using their names.",
      "The four-page letter, addressed to Bhattacharya, also was sent to Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and members of Congress who oversee the NIH. White House spokesman Kush Desai defended the administration's approach to federal research and said President Donald Trump is focused on restoring a \u201cGold Standard\u201d of science, not \u201cideological activism.\u201d",
      "The signers went public in the face of a \u201cculture of fear and suppression\u201d they say Trump's administration has spread through the federal civil service. \u201cWe are compelled to speak up when our leadership prioritizes political momentum over human safety and faithful stewardship of public resources,\u201d the declaration says.",
      "Bhattacharya responded to the declaration by saying it \u201chas some fundamental misconceptions about the policy directions the NIH has taken in recent months.\"",
      "\u201cNevertheless, respectful dissent in science is productive,\u201d he said in a statement. \"We all want the NIH to succeed.\u201d",
      "Named for the agency's headquarters location in Maryland, the Bethesda Declaration details upheaval in the world\u2019s premier public health research institution over the course of mere months.",
      "It addresses the termination of 2,100 research grants valued at more than $12 billion and some of the human costs that have resulted, such as cutting off medication regimens to participants in clinical trials or leaving them with unmonitored device implants.",
      "In one case, an NIH-supported study of multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis in Haiti had to be stopped, ceasing antibiotic treatment mid-course for patients.",
      "In a number of cases, trials that were mostly completed were rendered useless without the money to finish and analyze the work, the letter says. \u201cEnding a $5 million research study when it is 80% complete does not save $1 million,\u201d it says, \u201cit wastes $4 million.\u201d",
      "Jenna Norton, who oversees health disparity research at the agency's National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, recently appeared at a forum by Sen. Angela Alsobrooks, D-Md., to talk about what's happening at the NIH.",
      "At the event, she masked to conceal her identity. Now the mask is off. She was a lead organizer of the declaration.",
      "\u201cI want people to know how bad things are at NIH,\" Norton told The Associated Press.",
      "The signers said they modeled their indictment after Bhattacharya\u2019s Great Barrington Declaration in 2020, when he was a professor at Stanford University Medical School.",
      "His declaration drew together likeminded infectious disease epidemiologists and public health scientists who dissented from what they saw as excessive COVID-19 lockdown policies and felt ostracized by the larger public health community that pushed those policies, including the NIH.",
      "\u201cHe is proud of his statement, and we are proud of ours,\" said Sarah Kobrin, a branch chief at the NIH's National Cancer Institute who signed the Bethesda Declaration.",
      "As chief of the Health Systems and Interventions Research Branch, Kobrin provides scientific oversight of researchers across the country who've been funded by the cancer institute or want to be. Cuts in personnel and money have shifted her work from improving cancer care research to what she sees as minimizing its destruction. \"So much of it is gone \u2014 my work,\u201d she said.",
      "The 21-year NIH veteran said she signed because she didn't want to be \"a collaborator\u201d in the political manipulation of biomedical science.",
      "Ian Morgan, a postdoctoral fellow with the National Institute of General Medical Sciences, also signed the declaration. \u201cWe have a saying in basic science,\u201d he said. \u201cYou go and become a physician if you want to treat thousands of patients. You go and become a researcher if you want to save billions of patients.",
      "\u201cWe are doing the research that is going to go and create the cures of the future,\u201d he added. But that won\u2019t happen, he said, if Trump's Republican administration prevails with its searing grant cuts.",
      "The NIH employees interviewed by the AP emphasized they were speaking for themselves and not for their institutes nor the NIH.",
      "Employees from all 27 NIH institutes and centers gave their support to the declaration. Most who signed are intimately involved with evaluating and overseeing extramural research grants.",
      "The letter asserts \u201cNIH trials are being halted without regard to participant safety\u201d and the agency is shirking commitments to trial participants who \u201cbraved personal risk to give the incredible gift of biological samples, understanding that their generosity would fuel scientific discovery and improve health.\u201d",
      "The Trump administration has gone at public health research on several fronts, both directly, as part of its broad effort to root out diversity, equity and inclusion values throughout the bureaucracy, and as part of its drive to starve some universities of federal money.",
      "At the White House, Desai said Americans \u201chave lost confidence in our increasingly politicized healthcare and research apparatus that has been obsessed with DEI and COVID, which the majority of Americans moved on from years ago.\u201d",
      "This has forced \u201cindiscriminate grant terminations, payment freezes for ongoing research, and blanket holds on awards regardless of the quality, progress, or impact of the science,\u201d the declaration says.",
      "Some NIH employees have previously come forward in televised protests to air grievances, and many walked out of Bhattacharya's town hall with staff. The declaration is the first cohesive effort to register agency-wide dismay with the NIH's direction.",
      "The dissenters remind Bhattacharya in their letter of his oft-stated ethic that academic freedom must be a lynchpin in science.",
      "With that in place, he said in a statement in April, \u201cNIH scientists can be certain they are afforded the ability to engage in open, academic discourse as part of their official duties and in their personal capacities without risk of official interference, professional disadvantage or workplace retaliation.\"",
      "Now it will be seen whether that's enough to protect those NIH employees challenging the Trump administration and him.",
      "\u201cThere's a book I read to my kids, and it talks about how you can't be brave if you're not scared,\u201d said Norton, who has three young children. \"I am so scared about doing this, but I am trying to be brave for my kids because it's only going to get harder to speak up.",
      "\u201cMaybe I'm putting my kids at risk by doing this,\" she added. \"And I'm doing it anyway because I couldn't live with myself otherwise.\u201d",
      "e and noy on",
      "\u201cIn recent years, Americans have lost confidence in our increasingly politicized healthcare and research apparatus that has been obsessed with DEI and COVID, which the majority of Americans moved on from years ago,\u201d spokesman Kush Desai said. \u201cThe Trump administration is focused on restoring the Gold Standard of Science \u2014 not ideological activism \u2014 as the guiding principle of HHS, the NIH, and the CDC to finally address our chronic disease epidemic.\u201d",

      "The Trump administration's Environmental Protection Agency is taking aim at dozens of rules aimed at protecting the environment, including one that requires big polluters to report greenhouse gas emissions",
      "LEOPOLD, Ind. -- On the ceiling of Abbie Brockman\u2019s middle school English classroom in Perry County, the fluorescent lights are covered with images of a bright blue sky, a few clouds floating by.",
      "Outside, the real sky isn\u2019t always blue. Sometimes it\u2019s hazy, with pollution drifting from coal-fired power plants in this part of southwest Indiana. Knowing exactly how much, and what it may be doing to the people who live there, is why Brockman got involved with a local environmental organization that\u2019s installing air and water quality monitors in her community.",
      "\u201cIndustry and government is very, very, very powerful. It\u2019s more powerful than me. I\u2019m just an English teacher,\u201d Brockman said. But she wants to feel she can make a difference.",
      "In a way, Brockman\u2019s monitoring echoes the reporting that the Environmental Protection Agency began requiring from large polluters more than a decade ago. Emissions from four coal-fired plants in southwest Indiana have dropped 60% since 2010, when the rule took effect.",
      "That rule is now on the chopping block, one of many that President Donald Trump\u2019s EPA argues is costly and burdensome for industry.",
      "But experts say dropping the requirement risks a big increase in emissions if companies are no longer publicly accountable for what they put in the air. And they say losing the data \u2014 at the same time the EPA is cutting air quality monitoring elsewhere \u2014 would make it tougher to fight climate change.",
      "At stake is the Greenhouse Gas Reporting program, a 2009 rule from President Barack Obama's administration that affects large carbon polluters like refineries, power plants, wells and landfills. In the years since, they've collectively reported a 20% drop in emissions, mostly driven by the closure of coal plants.",
      "And what happens at these big emitters makes a difference. Their declining emissions account for more than three-quarters of the overall, if modest, decline in all U.S. greenhouse gas emissions since 2010.",
      "The registry includes places not usually thought of as big polluters but that have notable greenhouse gas emissions, such as college campuses, breweries and cereal factories. Even Walt Disney World in Florida, where pollution dropped 62% since 2010, has to report along with nearly 10,600 other places.",
      "\"We can\u2019t solve climate change without knowing how much pollution major facilities are emitting and how that\u2019s changing over time,\" said Jeremy Symons, a former EPA senior climate adviser now at Environmental Protection Network, an organization of ex-EPA officials that monitors environmental policies. The group provided calculations as a part of The Associated Press' analysis of impacts from proposed rule rollbacks.",
      "Symons said some companies would welcome the end of the registry because it would make it easier to pollute.",
      "It\u2019s not clear how much the registry itself has contributed to declining emissions. More targeted regulations on smokestack emissions, as well as coal being crowded out by cheaper and less polluting natural gas, are bigger factors.",
      "But the registry \u201cdoes put pressure on companies to ... document what they\u2019ve done or at least to provide a baseline for what they\u2019ve done,\u201d said Stanford University climate scientist Rob Jackson, who heads Global Carbon Project, a group of scientists that tally national carbon emissions yearly.",
      "Gina McCarthy, a former EPA administrator under Obama, said the registry makes clear how power plants are doing against each other, and that's an inducement to lower emissions.",
      "\"It is money for those companies. It's costs. It's reputation. It's been, I think, a wonderful success story and I hope it continues.\u201d",
      "The potential end of the reporting requirement comes as experts say much of the country's air goes unmonitored. Nelson Arley Roque, a Penn State professor who co-authored a study in April on these \u201cmonitoring deserts,\u201d said about 40% of U.S. lands are unmonitored. That often includes poor and rural neighborhoods.",
      "\"The air matters to all of us, but apparently 50 million people can\u2019t know or will never know'' how bad the air is, Roque said.",
      "The EPA is also trying to claw back money that had been earmarked for air monitoring, part of the termination of grants that it has labeled as targeting diversity, equity and inclusion. That includes $500,000 that would have funded 40 air monitors in a low-income and minority community in the Charlotte, North Carolina, area.",
      "CleaneAIRE NC, a nonprofit that works to improve air quality across the state that was awarded the grant, is suing.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not diversity, equity and inclusion. It\u2019s human rights,\u201d said Daisha Wall, the group's community science program manager. \u201cWe all deserve a right to clean air.\u201d",
      "Research strongly links poor air quality to diseases like asthma and heart disease, with a slightly less established link to cancer. Near polluting industries, experts say what\u2019s often lacking is either enough data in specific locations or the will to investigate the health toll.",
      "Indiana says it \u201cmaintains a robust statewide monitoring and assessment program for air, land and water,\u201d but Brockman and others in this part of the state aren't satisfied. She and other members of local advocacy groups Southwestern Indiana Citizens for Quality of Life and Valley Watch install and maintain their own air and water quality monitors. It\u2019s a full-time job to keep the network of monitors up and running, fighting spotty Wi-Fi and connectivity issues.",
      "Fighting industry is a sensitive subject, Brockman added. Many families depend on jobs at coal-fired power plants, and poverty is real. She keeps snacks in her desk for the kids who haven\u2019t eaten breakfast.",

      "Police in Northern Ireland say 17 officers were injured during a second night of anti-immigrant violence in the town of Ballymena",
      "LONDON -- Police in Northern Ireland say 17 officers were injured during a second night of anti-immigrant violence in the town of Ballymena, where rioters threw bricks, bottles, petrol bombs and fireworks and set several vehicles and houses on fire.",
      "Police used water cannon and fired rubber bullets to disperse a crowd of several hundred people. The Police Service of Northern Ireland said Wednesday that the violence died down by about 1 a.m. (0000GMT). Five people were arrested on suspicion of \u201criotous behavior.\u201d",
      "Violence erupted Monday after a peaceful march to show support for the family of the victim of an alleged sexual assault on the weekend. Two 14-year-old boys have been charged.",
      "The suspects have not been identified because of their age. They were supported in court by a Romanian interpreter.",
      "After the march, a crowd of mostly young people set several houses on fire and pelted police with projectiles. The Police Service of Northern Ireland said 15 officers were injured that night.",
      "There were similar scenes after dark on Tuesday, as well as small pockets of disorder in several other Northern Ireland towns.",
      "Police said agitators on social media were helping fuel what Assistant Chief Constable Ryan Henderson called \u201cracist thuggery.\u201d",
      "Some politicians said immigration had strained the town of about 30,000 some 25 miles (40 km) northwest of Belfast, long known as a bastion of hardline pro-British Loyalism.",
      "Jim Allister, leader of the conservative party Traditional Unionist Voice, said \u201cunchecked migration, which is beyond what the town can cope with, is a source of past and future tensions.\u201d",
      "Some Romanians in Ballymena told Britain\u2019s PA news agency they had lived in the town for years and were shocked by the violence.",
      "Several houses in the Clonavon Terrace area that was the focus of the violence put up signs identifying their residents as British or Filipino in an apparent attempt to avoid being targeted.",
      "Henderson said there was no evidence that Loyalist paramilitaries, who still hold sway over Protestant communities, were behind the disorder.",
      "Northern Ireland has a long history of street disorder stretching back to tensions between the British unionist and Irish nationalist communities.",
      "Though three decades of violence known as \u201cthe Troubles\u201d largely ended after a 1998 peace accord, tensions remain between those \u2014 largely Protestants \u2014 who see themselves as British and Irish nationalists, who are mostly Catholic. In Belfast, \u201cpeace walls\u201d still separate working-class Protestant and Catholic areas.",
      "Street rioters sporadically clash with police, and recently immigrants have become a target.",
      "Anti-immigrant violence erupted in Northern Ireland as well as England last year after three girls were stabbed to death at a Taylor Swift-themed dance class in the northwest England town of Southport. Authorities said online misinformation wrongly identifying the U.K.-born teenage attacker as a migrant played a part.",
      "Police condemned the latest violence and said they would call in officers from England and Wales to bolster their response if needed.",
      "All the parties in Northern Ireland\u2019s power-sharing government issued a joint statement appealing for calm and urging people to reject \u201cthe divisive agenda being pursued by a minority of destructive, bad faith actors.\"",
      "On the alleged sexual assault, the statement added that \u201cit is paramount that the justice process is now allowed to take its course so that this heinous crime can be robustly investigated. Those weaponizing the situation in order to sow racial tensions do not care about seeing justice and have nothing to offer their communities but division and disorder.\u201d",

      "Pope Leo XIV has made his first appointment of a Chinese bishop",
      "VATICAN CITY -- VATICAN CITY (AP) \u2014 Pope Leo XIV made his first appointment of a Chinese bishop under the Vatican\u2019s 2018 agreement with Beijing, signalling he is continuing one of Pope Francis\u2019 most controversial foreign policy decisions.",
      "The Vatican expressed satisfaction that Leo\u2019s June 5 nomination of Bishop Joseph Lin Yuntuan as auxiliary bishop of Fuzhou was recognized Wednesday by Chinese authorities.",
      "The Vatican said in a statement that Lin taking possession of the diocese and the civic recognition of his appointment \u201cconstitutes a further fruit of the dialogue between the Holy See and the Chinese authorities and is a significant step in the diocese\u2019s communal journey.\u201d",
      "Francis had riled conservatives when he approved a deal in 2018 over bishop nominations, which had been the most divisive issue in Vatican-China relations since diplomatic ties were severed when the Communists came to power. China had insisted on an exclusive right to name bishops as a matter of national sovereignty, while the Vatican asserted the pope\u2019s exclusive right to name the successors of the original Apostles.",
      "China's estimated 12 million Catholics have been divided between an official, state-controlled church that didn\u2019t recognize papal authority and an underground church that remained loyal to Rome through decades of persecution. The Vatican tried for decades to unify the flock and the 2018 deal was aimed at healing that division, regularizing the status of seven bishops who weren\u2019t recognized by Rome and thawing decades of estrangement between China and the Vatican.",
      "The details of the 2018 deal were never released, but it affords the state-controlled church a say in its church leaders, though Francis insisted he retained veto power over the ultimate choice.",
      "The deal has been criticized by some, especially on the Catholic right, for having caved to Beijing\u2019s demands and sold out the underground faithful in China. The Vatican has said it was the best deal it could get and has been renewed periodically since then.",
      "One of the big foreign policy questions facing Leo, history's first American pope, was whether he would continue renewing the accord or heed conservative demands and make some changes.",
      "There have been apparent violations on the Beijing side with some unilateral appointments that occurred without papal consent. The issue came to a head just before the conclave that elected Leo pope, when the Chinese church proceeded with the preliminary election of two bishops, a step that comes before official consecration.",

      "Britain\u2019s Labour government will hope to regain the political initiative when Treasury chief Rachel Reeves sets out her spending plans for the coming years",
      "LONDON -- Britain's Labour government hopes to regain the political initiative Wednesday when Treasury chief Rachel Reeves sets out her spending plans for the coming years, with big increases expected for health, defense and housing.",
      "Reeves, who has been blamed by many for Labour's decline in popularity since it returned to power after 14 years in July, will outline the government's spending and investment priorities for lawmakers. There will be no tax announcements.",
      "Reeves is expected to argue the government is on the path to \u201crenewing Britain\u201d but that \u201ctoo many people in too many parts of the country are yet to feel it,\u201d according to remarks issued by the Treasury.",
      "\u201cThis government\u2019s task \u2014 my task \u2014 and the purpose of this spending review is to change that, to ensure that renewal is felt in people\u2019s everyday lives, their jobs, their communities,\" she is expected to tell lawmakers.",
      "Labour won a landslide victory last year on a slogan of \u201cchange\u201d and voter anger at the Conservative administration in power at the time, but its vote share was historically low for a winning party at 35%.",
      "In the months since, Labour has been overtaken in opinion polls by the anti-immigration and recently formed Reform UK. Reeves has been blamed by many for Labour's struggles, not least her decision in July to withdraw a winter fuel subsidy to all but the poorest retirees.",
      "The outcry, which contributed to Labour's poor performance in recent local elections, prompted Reeves to about-turn and raise the threshold at which retirees will get the subsidy.",
      "She and Prime Minister Keir Starmer will hope the change will stem the anger and focus voters on other issues, such as its spending priorities.",
      "Among the main announcements is expected to be a 30 billion-pound ($41 billion) increase in funding for Britain's cherished but struggling National Health Service, as well as a rise in defense spending that will account for 2.5% of national output by 2027. Billions more are expected for social housing as the government aims to meet its target of building 1.5 million new homes by the next election.",
      "However, some departments are set to lose out after accounting for inflation, including local government, the justice system and the Home Office.",
      "Reeves has insisted she won't go on a big splurge, arguing that all her spending plans will meet her self-imposed fiscal rules.",
      "After raising taxes on business in her first budget last October, Reeves will find it difficult to swell the Treasury's coffers further in coming years as Labour won the election on a promise it would not increase income or sales taxes.",
      "And with the British economy still growing at historically low levels, the tax take is not expected to get a big lift.",
      "Reeves will hope her investment plans can help change that.",

      "South Korea\u2019s military has shut down loudspeakers broadcasting anti-North Korean propaganda along the inter-Korean border",
      "SEOUL, South Korea -- South Korea\u2019s military shut down loudspeakers broadcasting anti-North Korea propaganda along the inter-Korean border on Wednesday, marking the new liberal government\u2019s first concrete step toward easing tensions between the war-divided rivals.",
      "The South resumed the daily loudspeaker broadcasts in June last year following a yearslong pause in retaliation for North Korea flying trash-laden balloons toward the South in a psychological warfare campaign.",
      "South Korea\u2019s Defense Ministry said the move, ordered by President Lee Jae-myung, was part of efforts \u201cto restore trust in inter-Korean relations and promote peace on the Korean Peninsula.\u201d",
      "Kang Yu-jung, Lee\u2019s spokesperson, described the decision as a \u201cproactive step\u201d to reduce military tensions and ease the burden for South Koreans residing in border areas, who have also been affected by North Korea\u2019s retaliatory loudspeaker broadcasts.",
      "North Korea, which is extremely sensitive to any outside criticism of its authoritarian leadership and its third-generation ruler, Kim Jong Un, didn\u2019t immediately comment on the step by Seoul.",
      "South Korea reactivated its front-line loudspeakers to blast propaganda messages and K-pop songs toward the North last year in response to thousands of trash balloons that Pyongyang flew toward South Korea to drop substances including wastepaper, cloth scraps, cigarette butts and even manure.",
      "From May to November last year, North Korea flew about 7,000 balloons toward South Korea in 32 separate occasions, according to the South's military. The North said that its balloon campaign came after South Korean activists sent over balloons filled with anti-North Korean leaflets, as well as USB sticks filled with popular South Korean songs and dramas.",
      "Trash carried by at least one North Korean balloon fell on the South Korean presidential compound in July, raising concerns about the vulnerability of key South Korean facilities. Officials said that the balloon contained no dangerous material and no one was hurt.",
      "The South's broadcast playlist was clearly designed to strike a nerve in Pyongyang, where Kim\u2019s government has been intensifying a campaign to eliminate the influence of South Korean pop culture and language among the population in a bid to strengthen his family\u2019s dynastic rule.",
      "The Cold War-style psychological warfare campaigns added to tensions fueled by North Korea\u2019s growing nuclear ambitions and South Korean efforts to expand joint military exercises with the United States and strengthen three-way security cooperation with Japan.",
      "Lee, an outspoken liberal who took office last week after winning an early election to replace ousted conservative Yoon Suk Yeol, has vowed to improve relations with Pyongyang, which reacted furiously to Yoon\u2019s hard-line policies and shunned dialogue.",
      "During his election campaign, Lee promised to halt the loudspeaker broadcasts, arguing that they created unnecessary tensions and discomfort for South Korean residents in border towns. In recent months, those residents had complained about North Korea\u2019s retaliatory broadcasts, which included howling animals, pounding gongs and other irritating sounds.",
      "In a briefing on Monday, South Korea\u2019s Unification Ministry, which handles inter-Korean affairs, also called for South Korean civilian activists to stop flying anti-North Korean propaganda leaflets across the border. Such activities \u201ccould heighten tensions on the Korean Peninsula and threaten the lives and safety of residents in border areas,\u201d said Koo Byoungsam, the ministry\u2019s spokesperson.",
      "In his inaugural address last week, Lee vowed to reopen communication channels with North Korea. But prospects for an early resumption of dialogue between the rival Koreas remain dim. North Korea has consistently rejected offers from South Korea and the United States since 2019, when nuclear talks between Washington and Pyongyang collapsed over sanctions-related disagreements.",
      "North Korea\u2019s priority in foreign policy is now firmly with Russia, which has received thousands of North Korean troops and large amounts of military equipment in recent months for its war with Ukraine. South Korean and U.S. officials have expressed concern that Kim in return could seek Russian technology transfers that could enhance the threat posed by his nuclear weapons and missile program.",
      "Yoon, who was removed from office in April over his short-lived imposition of martial law in December, had focused on strengthening military partnerships with Washington and Tokyo and on securing stronger U.S. assurances of a swift and decisive nuclear response to defend the South against a North Korean nuclear attack.",
      "In a fierce reaction to Yoon\u2019s policies, Kim declared in January 2024 that he was abandoning the long-standing goals of a peaceful unification with the South and instructed the rewriting of the North\u2019s constitution to cement the South as a permanent \u201cprincipal enemy.\u201d",
      "Following years of heightened testing activity, Kim has acquired a broad range of missiles that could potentially target rivals in Asia and the U.S. mainland. He has also called for increased production of nuclear materials to create more bombs.",
      "Rafael Mariano Grossi, director of the International Atomic Energy Agency, said Monday that the U.N. nuclear watchdog is monitoring signs that North Korea may be building a new uranium-enrichment plant at its main nuclear complex in Yongbyon.",

At 10 a.m. on Wednesday, marking the moment a day earlier when police were alerted to shots at the BORG Dreiersch\u00fctzengasse high school, the country stopped for a minute of silence.",
      "Hundreds of people lined the central square in Graz, Austria's second-biggest city. Some laid more candles and flowers in front of the city hall, adding to a growing memorial to the victims. The first candles were laid on Tuesday evening as a crowd gathered on the square, some people hugging each other as they tried to come to terms with the tragedy. Hundreds of people joined Austrian officials at a service Tuesday evening in the Graz cathedral.",

      "But on the outskirts of Madrid, far from the souvenir shops and tourist sites, a rustic tavern named Casa Pedro makes a bold claim. Its owners assert the establishment endured not just the Spanish Civil War in the 1930s and the Napoleonic invasion in the early 1800s, but even the War of Spanish Succession at the start of the 18th century \u2014 a lineage that would make Casa Pedro older than Bot\u00edn and a strong contender for the title.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s really frustrating when you say, \u2018Yes, we\u2019ve been around since 1702,\u2019 but ... you can\u2019t prove it,\u201d said manager and eighth-generation proprietor Irene Gui\u00f1ales. \u201cIf you look at the restaurant\u2019s logo, it says \u2018Casa Pedro, since 1702,\u2019 so we said, \u2018Damn it, let\u2019s try to prove it.\u2019\u201d",
      "Gui\u00f1ales, 51, remembers her grandfather swearing by Casa Pedro\u2019s age, but she was aware that decades-old hearsay from a proud old-timer wouldn't be enough to prove it. Her family hired a historian and has so far turned up documents dating the restaurant's operations to at least 1750.",
      "That puts them within striking distance of Bot\u00edn\u2019s record.",
      "Both taverns are family-owned. Both offer Castilian classics like stewed tripe and roast suckling pig. They are decorated with charming Spanish tiles, feature ceilings with exposed wooden beams and underground wine cellars. And both enjoy a rich, star-studded history.",
      "Bot\u00edn's celebrated past includes a roster of literary patrons like Truman Capote, F. Scott Fitzgerald and Graham Greene. In his book \u201cThe Sun Also Rises,\u201d Ernest Hemingway described it as \u201cone of the best restaurants in the world.\" While Casa Pedro may not have boasted the same artistic pedigree, it boasts its own VIPs. Its walls are adorned with decades-old photographs of former Spanish King Juan Carlos I dining in one of its many rooms. The current Spanish monarch, King Felipe VI dines there, too, albeit more inconspicuously than his father.",
      "But the similarities between the two hotspots end there.",
      "Casa Pedro was once a stop on the only road heading north from the Spanish capital toward France. Its clientele is largely local regulars, like David Gonz\u00e1lez and Mayte Villena, who for years have spent every Friday lunching at the tavern.",
      "\u201cIt wouldn't change a thing for us,\u201d Villena said about the restaurant someday securing the Guinness title.",
      "Bot\u00edn, on the other hand, is a stone\u2019s throw from Madrid\u2019s famed Plaza Mayor, where any day of the week tour guides are herding groups around town \u2014 and often straight through the restaurant's front door.",
      "Antonio Gonz\u00e1lez, a third-generation proprietor of Bot\u00edn, concedes that the Guinness accolade awarded in 1987 has helped business, but said the restaurant had enough history to draw visitors even before.",
      "\u201cIt has a certain magic,\u201d he said.",
      "The question then becomes: How can either restaurant definitively claim the title? Guinness provides its specific guidelines for the superlative only to applicants, according to spokesperson Kylie Galloway, noting that it entails \u201csubstantial evidence and documentation of the restaurant\u2019s operation over the years.\"",
      "Gonz\u00e1lez said that Guinness required Bot\u00edn show that it has continuously operated in the same location with the same name.",
      "The only time the restaurant closed was during the COVID-19 pandemic, as did Casa Pedro.",
      "That criteria would mean that restaurants that are even older \u2014 Paris' Le Procope, which says it was founded in 1686, or Beijing\u2019s Bianyifang, founded in 1416, or the 1673-established White Horse Tavern in Newport, Rhode Island \u2014 aren't eligible for the designation.",
      "La Campana, in Rome\u2019s historic center, claims over 500 years of operation, citing documents on its menu and in a self-published history. Its owners say they have compiled the requisite paperwork and plan to submit it to Guinness.",
      "Gui\u00f1ales and her husband couldn't consult archives from the former town of Fuencarral, now a Madrid neighborhood. Those papers went up in flames during the Spanish Civil War. Instead, they delved into Spanish national archives, where they found land registries of the area from the First Marquess of Ensenada (1743-1754) that showed the existence of a tavern, wine cellar and inn in the small town as of 1750.",
      "In their spare time, the couple continues to hunt for records proving that Casa Pedro indeed dates back to 1702, as is proclaimed on its walls, takeout bags and sugar packets.",
      "But even if they dig up the final documents and wrest the Guinness honor from Bot\u00edn, Gui\u00f1ales concedes that her restaurant's quiet location makes it unlikely to draw Bot\u00edn\u2019s clientele in central Madrid.",
      "\u201cTo think that we could reach that public would be incredible,\u201d Gui\u00f1ales said. \u201cIt's a dream, but it's a dream.\u201d",

      "Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk has defended his centrist, pro-European government before parliament, seeking to reassert control and rally his fractured coalition after suffering a bitter political defeat",
      "WARSAW, Poland -- WARSAW, Poland (AP) \u2014 Prime Minister Donald Tusk defended his centrist, pro-European government before parliament on Wednesday, seeking to reassert control and rally his fractured coalition after suffering a bitter political defeat.",
      "Tusk requested a vote of confidence in the wake of the June 1 loss of Warsaw Mayor Rafa\u0142 Trzaskowski \u2014 his close ally \u2014 to nationalist historian Karol Nawrocki. Backed by U.S. President Donald Trump, Nawrocki is set to replace outgoing President Andrzej Duda, another conservative who repeatedly blocked Tusk\u2019s reform efforts.",
      "\u201cI am asking for a vote of confidence with full conviction that we have a mandate to govern, to take full responsibility for what is happening in Poland,\u201d Tusk said.",
      "Most of the power in Poland's parliamentary system rests with an elected parliament and a government chosen by the parliament. However, the president can veto legislation and represents the country abroad.",
      "\u201cAnyone who is ready to move forward with me, with the government, and above all with our voters, regardless of these momentary emotions, and build a better Poland, should vote today for a vote of confidence in our government,\" Tusk said.",
      "The vote, scheduled for Wednesday afternoon, is widely expected to go in Tusk\u2019s favor. His four-party coalition holds a narrow but stable majority in the 460-seat Sejm, Poland\u2019s lower house.",
      "A loss would trigger the formation of a caretaker government and may open the door for an early parliamentary election. That could potentially returning power to the conservative Law and Justice party, in coalition with the far-right Confederation party, whose candidate placed third in the presidential race.",
      "Tusk had long counted on a Trzaskowski victory to break the institutional deadlock created by Duda\u2019s vetoes. Instead, he now faces an incoming president aligned with the nationalist opposition and openly hostile to his government\u2019s legislative priorities.",
      "\u201cWe cannot close our eyes to reality,\u201d he said. \u201cA president who was reluctant to accept the changes we proposed for Poland and our voters is being replaced by a president who is at least equally reluctant to those changes and proposals.\u201d",
      "But he also argued that Trzaskowski\u2019s narrow defeat indicates that there is continued strong support for those who share his views.",
      "The election result has rattled the already uneasy governing coalition, which spans from center-left to center-right and has struggled to deliver on key campaign pledges, including liberalizing Poland\u2019s abortion law and legalizing same-sex civil unions. Tusk acknowledged the growing strains in Wednesday\u2019s address.",
      "Many are also blaming Tusk for contributing to Trzaskowski\u2019s loss. Much of the criticism has come from within his coalition, as his partners examine whether they are better off sticking with him or risking a collapse of the coalition. Some are calling for a new prime minister to be selected.",
      "There are questions about what Tusk can realistically achieve before the next parliamentary election, scheduled for late 2027, and whether the coalition will even survive that long amid a surge in popularity for the far right. Polish media and political analysts are debating whether this might be the 68-year-old Tusk's political twilight.",
      "\u201cI know the taste of victory, I know the bitterness of defeat, but I don\u2019t know the word surrender,\u201d Tusk said.",
      "As part of his fresh start, he announced plans for a government reconstruction in July that will include \u201cnew faces.\u201d He said a government spokesman would be appointed in June \u2014 an acknowledgement that the coalition needs a way to present a unified message. So far Tusk has sought to communicate his policies to the public himself on social media and in news conferences.",
      "Tusk served as Polish prime minister from 2007 to 2014 and then as president of the European Council from 2014 to 2019. He became Poland's prime minister again in December 2023 in a country exhausted by the pandemic and inflation, and with political divisions deep and bitter.",
      "In a sign of those divisions, half of the parliament hall was empty on Wednesday, with lawmakers from the right-wing Law and Justice party boycotting his speech. Tusk said their absence showed disrespect to the nation.",

      "Spain\u2019s economy minister Carlos Cuerpo says the millions of tourists who visit the country every year pose a challenge for Spain's residents that the government can no longer afford to ignore",
      "MADRID -- Spain's economy minister says the millions of tourists who visit the country every year present a challenge for Spain's residents that the government can no longer afford to ignore.",
      "Last year, Spain received a record 94 million international visitors, making it one of the most visited countries in the world. It could receive as many as 100 million tourists this year, according to some projections.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s important to understand that these record numbers in terms of tourism also pose challenges,\u201d Economy Minister Carlos Cuerpo said in an interview Tuesday with The Associated Press. \u201cAnd we need to deal with those challenges also for our own population.\u201d",
      "Tourism is a key sector for the Southern European nation's economy, which grew faster than any major advanced economy last year at 3.2%, and is projected to grow at 2.4% this year, according to the Bank of Spain, well ahead of the expected eurozone average of 0.9%.",
      "But a stubborn housing crisis in which home and rental costs have skyrocketed in cities such as Madrid, Barcelona and elsewhere has led to growing frustration about one aspect tied to tourism in particular: the proliferation of short-term rental apartments in city centers.",
      "The country has seen several large protests that have drawn tens of thousands of people to demand more government action on housing. Signs at demonstrations with slogans such as \u201cGet Airbnb out of our neighborhoods\u201d point to the growing anger.",
      "In response, the government recently announced it was cracking down on Airbnb listings that it said were operating in the country illegally, a decision that the company is appealing.",
      "\u201cWe are a 49 million-inhabitants country,\" Cuerpo said. The record numbers of tourists illustrate the \u201cattractiveness of our country, but also of the challenge that we have in terms of dealing and providing for a good experience for tourists, but at the same time avoiding overcharging (for) our own services and our own housing,\u201d he said.",
      "The Bank of Spain recently said the country has a deficit of 450,000 homes. Building more public housing is critical to solve the problem, Cuerpo said. Spain has a lower stock of public housing than many other major European Union countries.",
      "\u201cThis is the key challenge for this term,\u201d the minister said of the country's housing woes.",
      "On the possibility of more U.S. tariffs on EU goods, the top economic policymaker for the eurozone's fourth-largest economy said he believed the EU still wanted to reinforce economic ties with the U.S.",
      "\u201cFrom the EU side, we are constructive but we are not naive,\" Cuerpo said, adding that the bloc would pursue \u201cother routes protecting our firms and industries\u201d if no agreement with the Trump administration can be reached.",
      "A 90-day pause on tariffs announced by the EU and the U.S. is slated to end on July 14. About halfway through that grace period, U.S. President Donald Trump announced 50% tariffs on steel imports. The U.S. has also enacted a 25% tariff on vehicles and 10% so-called reciprocal tariffs on most other goods.",
      "On how Spain's current housing woes got here, the minister said a steep drop in construction in Spain following the 2008 financial crisis played a role. So did population growth due to immigration, Cuerpo said, and pressures from an increase in the number of tourists.",
      "While building more housing is key, the minister advocated for an all-of-the-above approach, including regulating Spain's housing market and short-term rental platforms.",
      "\u201cFor us, there\u2019s no silver bullet,\u201d he said.",

      "LONDON -- Several global brands are among dozens of companies at risk of using forced labor through their Chinese supply chains because they use critical minerals or buy minerals-based products sourced from China's far-western Xinjiang region, an international rights group said Wednesday.",
      "The report by the Netherlands-based Global Rights Compliance says companies including Avon, Walmart, Nescafe, Coca-Cola and paint supplier Sherwin-Williams may be linked to titanium sourced from Xinjiang, where rights groups allege the Chinese government runs coercive labor practices targeting predominantly Muslim Uyghurs and other Turkic minorities.",
      "The report comes as China and the United States, the world's two largest economies, continue talks aimed at easing their trade dispute.",
      "The report found 77 Chinese suppliers in the titanium, lithium, beryllium and magnesium industries operating in Xinjiang. It said the suppliers are at risk of participating in the Chinese government's \u201clabor transfer programs,\" in which Uyghurs are forced to work in factories as part of a longstanding campaign of assimilation and mass detention.",
      "Commercial paints, thermos cups and components for the aerospace, auto and defense industries are among products sold internationally that can trace their supply chains to minerals from Xinjiang, the report said. It said companies must review their supply chains.",
      "\u201cMineral mining and processing in (Xinjiang) rely in part on the state\u2019s forced labor programs for Uyghurs and other Turkic people in the region,\u201d the report said.",
      "The named companies did not immediately comment on the report.",
      "A 2022 United Nations report found China may have committed crimes against humanity in Xinjiang, where more than 1 million Uyghurs are estimated to have been arbitrarily detained as part of measures the Chinese government said were intended to target terrorism and separatism.",
      "The Chinese government has rejected the U.N. claims and defended its actions in Xinjiang as fighting terror and ensuring stability.",
      "In 2021, former U.S. President Joe Biden signed a law to block imports from the Xinjiang region unless businesses can prove the items were made without forced labor. The law initially targeted solar products, tomatoes, cotton and apparel, but the U.S. government recently added new sectors for enforcement, including aluminum and seafood.",
      "A recent report by the International Energy Agency said the world\u2019s sources of critical minerals are increasingly concentrated in a few countries, notably China, which is also a leading refining and processing base for lithium, cobalt, graphite and other minerals.",
      "Many of China's major minerals corporations have invested in the exploration and mining of lithium, a key component for electric vehicle batteries, in Xinjiang, Global Rights Compliance said. Xinjiang is also China's top source of beryllium, a mineral used for aerospace, defense and telecommunications, its report said.",

      "Close underworld ties have long existed between organized crime groups in Mexico and Colombia. For many years, Colombian drug traffickers produced cocaine and heroin and moved it themselves by boat or plane to the United States. Later, as U.S. authorities cracked down on trafficking in the Caribbean, Mexican cartels' power grew as they moved Colombian drugs over land and via small plane to the U.S. border and smuggled them across.",

      "The court asked Argentina's security ministry to set up a detention center to hold 72-year-old Fern\u00e1ndez. Her defense lawyer Carlos Beraldi told C5N, a television station in Buenos Aires, that he had requested Fern\u00e1ndez be allowed to serve her sentence in house arrest given her age.",
      "The ruling bars Fern\u00e1ndez from running in this fall's Buenos Aires legislative elections just days after she launched her campaign.",
      "Fern\u00e1ndez, who dominated Argentine politics for two decades and forged the country\u2019s main left-wing populist movement known as Kirchnerism, after her and her husband, former President N\u00e9stor Kirchner, rejects the charges as politically motivated.",
      "During Fern\u00e1ndez's eight years in office (2007\u20132015), Argentina expanded cash payments to the poor and pioneered major social assistance programs. But her governments funded the unbridled state spending by printing money, bringing Argentina notoriety for massive budget deficits and sky-high inflation.",
      "Critics blamed Argentina's years of economic volatility on Fern\u00e1ndez\u2019s policies, and outrage over successive economic crises and the country's bloated bureaucracy helped vault radical libertarian President Javier Milei to the presidency in late 2023.",
      "The ruling dealt a severe blow to Milei\u2019s opposition during a crucial midterm election year. He celebrated the ruling, writing on social media: \u201cJustice. Period.\u201d",
      "Fern\u00e1ndez was embroiled in multiple corruption scandals during her tenure. She was convicted in 2022 in this corruption case, which centered on 51 public contracts for public works awarded to companies linked to L\u00e1zaro B\u00e1ez, a convicted construction magnate and friend of the presidential couple, at prices 20% above the standard rate in a scheme that cost the state tens of millions of dollars.",
      "The high court rejected Fern\u00e1ndez's request for the court to review her prison sentence in March. In a resolution obtained by The Associated Press, the court said that the prison sentence \u201cdoes nothing more than to protect our republican and democratic system.\"",
      "The Kirchner governments carried out \u201can extraordinary fraudulent maneuver\u201d that harmed the interests of the government and resulted in the embezzlement of roughly $70 million at the current exchange rate, the resolution said.",
      "Supporters of Fern\u00e1ndez and her political movement blocked main roads into Buenos Aires and stormed the offices of Argentina's two main cable networks that are widely considered critical of the ex-leader, Channel 13 and Todos Noticias, smashing televisions, vandalizing cars and shattering windows. There were no injuries reported.",
      "Fern\u00e1ndez rejected the decision, calling the court justices \u201cpuppets\u201d of those wielding economic power in the country.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re three puppets answering to those ruling far above them,\" she told supporters in a rousing speech outside her party's headquarters. \u201cIt's not the opposition. It's the concentrated economic power of Argentina's government.\u201d",
      "Gregorio Dalb\u00f3n, one of Fern\u00e1ndez's lawyers, vowed \u201cto take this case to all international human rights organizations.\u201d",
      "Fern\u00e1ndez has questioned the impartiality of the judges. She claims her defense didn't have access to much of the evidence and that it was gathered without regard to legal deadlines.",
      "Fern\u00e1ndez faces a series of other upcoming trials on corruption charges.",

      "CAPE TOWN, South Africa -- At least seven people have died in flooding in South Africa after a weather front bringing heavy rain and snow hit eastern and southern provinces, officials said Tuesday.",
      "A bus carrying high school students was swept away in the floods in the Eastern Cape province and an unknown number of children were missing, the provincial government said in a statement. Three children were rescued after they clung onto trees, according to the South African National Taxi Council, which said the bus was operated by one of its members.",
      "Disaster response teams have been activated in the province on the south coast.",
      "Six people died in flooding in the Eastern Cape city of Mthatha, where houses and cars were left submerged. A seventh body was recovered near the town of Tsolo, around 40 kilometers (25 miles) northwest of Mthatha, the provincial government said.",
      "It said a search was underway for the minibus carrying schoolchildren that was swept away on Tuesday morning. SANTACO, the taxi council, said it was unclear how many children there were on the 22-seater bus when it was swept away by floodwater at a bridge near Mthatha.",
      "\u201cEyewitnesses at the scene reported seeing at least three (children) clinging to trees and calling for help,\u201d SANTACO said. \u201cThe three have since been rescued.\u201d",
      "Eastern Cape Premier Oscar Mabuyane said \u201cthis is a devastating reminder of nature's force.\u201d",
      "Another five people were killed in a car crash in the Eastern Cape on Tuesday when a minibus taxi overturned, according to provincial transport department spokesperson Unathi Binqose. He said the driver of the minibus was attempting to avoid a tree that had fallen onto the road.",
      "The South African Weather Service has forecast several days of disruptive rain and snow for the Eastern Cape and the neighboring KwaZulu-Natal province along the east coast. Part of a major highway connecting the two provinces was closed because of snow and disaster response teams were also activated in KwaZulu-Natal.",
      "South Africa occasionally experiences snow in some parts, but authorities had warned for days that a particularly strong cold front was about to hit the country.",

      "Around 15,000 protesters have filled a square in Hungary\u2019s capital",
      "BUDAPEST, Hungary -- Around 15,000 protesters filled a square in Hungary's capital Tuesday in what organizers called the beginning of a resistance movement against the government of populist Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n.",
      "Nearly two dozen public figures including writers, actors, musicians and journalists joined the demonstration in Budapest. Most of the speakers criticized what they see as the government's increasingly anti-democratic conduct. Some alleged corruption benefiting those with ties to Orb\u00e1n's Fidesz party.",
      "\u201cThis country doesn\u2019t belong to those who lie, who rob from the people, who have sold their humanity for power,\u201d said one speaker, Csaba Bogos. \u201cThis country belongs to those who dare to think, who can read between the lines, who trust in themselves and each other, and believe that there is a common, peaceful future that we must build together.\u201d",
      "It was the latest anti-government protest since Orb\u00e1n's party pushed through a law in March, and a constitutional amendment the following month, that effectively banned public LGBTQ+ events.",
      "That law also allowed for authorities to use facial recognition technology to identify and fine participants in prohibited assemblies. It drew allegations that Orb\u00e1n was leading the country toward a full autocracy similar to Russia under President Vladimir Putin.",
      "As national elections approach in 2026 and Orb\u00e1n\u2019s party trails in most polls to a new opposition challenger, the Hungarian leader\u2019s detractors say he has turned to more authoritarian tactics to silence critics.",
      "Speakers at Tuesday's demonstration warned that a recent draft bill that would allow the government to blacklist critical media organizations and NGOs would mean the end of independent journalism and civic engagement.",
      "That bill would allow the government to monitor, restrict, penalize and potentially ban organizations it deems a threat to Hungary's national sovereignty. Its passage was recently delayed until parliament\u2019s autumn session.",
      "Some 80 leading news outlets across Europe signed a petition urging the bill to be revoked, and the European Union's executive committee said it would breach EU laws and fundamental values.",
      "Demonstrator D\u00e1niel Szab\u00f3 said the law was not aimed at protecting Hungary's sovereignty, but designed to consolidate power for the governing party.",
      "\u201cWe clearly have the situation where the government is trying to silence the opposition,\u201d Szab\u00f3 said. \u201cThe possibility for any kind of normal coexistence or the possibility for consensus is attacked now from every direction.\u201d",
      "D\u00e9nes Sallai, a popular musician and rapper, told the crowd he sees signs that longtime support for Orb\u00e1n and his party was waning.",
      "\u201cThe majority of people are fed up with the actions of this regime, and there appears to be a real chance that next year, after 16 years, Fidesz won\u2019t be the one to form a government,\u201d he said.",

      "Some 6 million people fled Syria during the conflict, and the United Nations estimates that 90% of those who stayed lived in poverty and relied on humanitarian aid to survive. Half a million people were killed in the conflict.",

      "The IMF said it is developing a roadmap for Syria's policy and capacity building priorities for key economic institutions, including the finance ministry, central bank, and statistics agency.",

      "In 2017, the United Nations estimated that rebuilding Syria would cost about $250 billion. Since Assad was overthrown, some experts say that number could be as high as $400 billion.",

Inside, you\u2019ll find a well-built interior that\u2019s easy to use. The Ioniq 6 touts a long EPA-estimated range of up to 342 miles. It\u2019s also one of the quickest-charging EVs on the market when using a powerful fast-charging machine.",
      "The electric Hyundai\u2019s drawbacks are mostly minor, with one big exception. Its styling isn\u2019t for everyone and attracts attention for good and bad reasons. However, the upcoming 2026 model has updated styling that\u2019s easier on the eyes.",

      "The Ridgeline could be an ideal truck for you depending on your priorities. If you plan on frequently towing heavy loads and tackling serious off-road trails, then other midsize trucks like the Ford Ranger would be a better fit. But if not, you should consider the Ridgeline. It\u2019s more comfortable, has more passenger room and handles better than its rivals.",
      "The Ridgeline\u2019s towing capacity is certainly good enough for most uses, such as pulling a small camper trailer or toy hauler.

If you charge regularly, trips to the gas station will be rare thanks to the Outlander PHEV\u2019s lengthy 38-mile electric range. When the battery runs low, you\u2019ll get a respectable 26 mpg combined.",
      "With the third row folded down, the Outlander PHEV offers lots of cargo space. When it\u2019s up, you\u2019ll have room for seven passengers, but the third row is only large enough for kids.

The base engine is a fuel sipper that gets an EPA-estimated 41 mpg combined. The optional Hybrid Max engine produces an impressive 340 horsepower for quick acceleration, but fuel economy dips to 30 mpg combined.",
      "Inside, the Crown has a pleasing interior with large display screens, spacious seating and a comfortable ride. But all this comes at a cost. The Crown is pricey for a non-luxury hybrid sedan, especially the top Platinum trim that has the Hybrid Max engine.",
      "2025 Crown starting price: $42,575",
      "The G90 has everything you want in a large, lavish sedan except for brand cachet. Genesis is still relatively new in the luxury world, but its vehicles, especially the flagship G90, shouldn\u2019t be overlooked. This South Korean sedan touts style, power, exceptional comfort, and an opulent cabin with superb fit and finish. Some rivals offer the same but require an arm and a leg for payment. And you\u2019re mistaken if you think the G90 skimps on features.",
      "The top 3.5T E-Supercharger version doesn\u2019t offer any optional features because it comes equipped with many features, including many that usually cost thousands more than they would on a luxury rival. The most notable ones include front and rear massaging seats, a 26-speaker Bang & Olufsen audio system, a massive package of advanced driver aids, and an air suspension that scans the road ahead so it can adjust to road imperfections.",

      "Volunteers with the humanitarian nonprofit Team Rubicon are accustomed to filling in the gaps of disaster recovery \u2014 they chainsaw downed trees after wildfires, muck out flooded homes and rebuild roofs blown off by hurricanes.",
      "But with concern and confusion over how the federal government will respond to disasters this summer, the group is readying to possibly help in ways it hasn\u2019t before.",
      "\u201cThe one thing certain this hurricane season is the uncertainty of what\u2019s going to happen at the federal level,\u201d said Jeff Byard, Team Rubicon senior vice president of operations.",
      "Byard and his team are evaluating how else they can help communities if the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which oversees federal response to disasters, reduces its capacity or is deployed less often. President Donald Trump has repeatedly expressed his intent to overhaul FEMA, if not totally dismantle it.",
      "Team Rubicon is good at being agile, Byard said, but nonprofits and funders are already under pressure from more frequent and severe climate events. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be harder in a really hard situation already,\u201d he said.",
      "Experts worry Trump might approve fewer major disaster declarations, which unlock federal funding and resources, and that FEMA\u2019s response could be slowed or diminished. Trainings have been reduced, and around 2,000 employees have left or been fired since January, including high-level staff.",
      "\"Whether it's a hurricane or earthquake, the federal government is not prepared the way it has been in the past,\u201d said Michael Coen, who held posts at FEMA under three presidential administrations.",
      "Nonprofits and funders across the United States say there is too much at stake for communities to just wait and see what happens. \u201cFrom the nonprofit perspective, we have to really lean in,\u201d said Marcus Coleman, vice president of community resilience strategy for United Way Worldwide.",
      "FEMA is \u201cfully activated in preparation for Hurricane Season,\u201d and is \u201cshifting from bloated DC-centric dead weight to a lean, deployable disaster force that empowers state actors to provide relief for their citizens,\" according to a spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees the agency.",
      "Leaders in disaster relief say FEMA\u2019s absence would make it harder to coordinate resources across federal government, set up effective communications, and deploy emergency supplies. \u201cFEMA is a key partner, we need them,\u201d said David Guadalupe, chair of the National Voluntary Organizations Active in Disaster.",
      "They worry the sudden policy changes could leave many states unprepared and under-resourced, intensifying the need for donations and volunteers.",
      "\u201cThe worst case scenario is that that money gets pulled back and we have to fill in those gaps,\u201d said Ann Lee, CEO of the relief organization CORE.",
      "It would be especially difficult, they say, to replace the services under FEMA\u2019s Individual Assistance program, like temporary housing and grants to repair or replace damaged homes and vehicles.",
      "For direct assistance alone, FEMA has approved over $460 million for 160,000 households in North Carolina since Hurricane Helene, and more than $136 million for 34,500 households after the Los Angeles fires.",
      "\u201cIf the funding to the people gets eliminated, that\u2019s all they have,\u201d said Michael Capponi, president of Global Empowerment Mission, adding that while nonprofits are often faster and more efficient at getting people help, they still need the money to make it happen. \u201cThe private sector can never take that on,\u201d he said.",
      "FEMA also funds disaster case managers, who help survivors navigate paperwork, and legal and mental health support. Providing those services \u201cwill require even more robust volunteer organization,\u201d said Byard.",
      "Other needs could include supporting smaller, less experienced emergency management departments, collecting data about survivor needs, or hauling away debris if federal dollars don't pay for the pickup.",
      "Even when FEMA help is available, it could look different than recent years, said Coleman. He points out that the agency already canceled its door-to-door canvassing program that helped survivors enroll with FEMA, and worries the feds could give survivors less time to apply. \u201cThe effort to get the word out about FEMA assistance is critically important,\u201d he said. \u201cNonprofits will have to move quickly.\u201d",
      "Relief organizations like CORE and Good360 are also pre-positioning more supplies in storm-vulnerable areas, in part in case FEMA supplies arrive more slowly. Trump took up to eight weeks to approve some declaration requests this spring, making aid groups even more important as survivors waited for help. \u201cThat preparation is the biggest thing to focus on,\u201d said Lee.",

      "A United Way Worldwide survey of the 211 network found that referrals for disaster-related assistance rose over 50% in 2024. Nonprofits have also been weakened by losing federal grants as well as staff from AmeriCorps cuts.",
      "\u201cThe groups in the community 365 days a year are getting beat up significantly,\u201d said Noah Patton, director of disaster recovery at the National Low-Income Housing Coalition, adding community-based organizations are already under pressure from housing shortages and other crises.",

      "Funders that fuel recovery work say they can\u2019t replace federal money. \u201cIt\u2019s not just unrealistic, it\u2019s a dangerous abdication of public responsibility,\u201d said Ryan Eller, executive director of the Appalachia Funders Network. \u201cThere\u2019s a reason these agencies were brought about in the first place when local resources just can\u2019t meet the need.\u201d",
      "Philanthropy committed over $300 million to recovery to Hurricane Helene alone, and hundreds of millions more each for the fires in LA and on Maui. Eller said it\u2019s getting harder to fundraise for recovery. \u201cThere is a general fatigue around disaster philanthropy because of the volume and frequency of storms,\u201d he said.",
      "Even if a nonprofit can't take on more, simply building relationships with state and local government, residents, and fellow relief groups ahead of an emergency will make everyone more prepared, said Byard. \u201cTake FEMA out of it, now we\u2019re really looking at communities supporting communities,\u201d he said. \u201cThat can build some really really strong resilience.\u201d",

      "SEOUL, South Korea -- South Korea\u2019s military has shut down loudspeakers broadcasting anti-North Korea propaganda along the inter-Korean border, marking the new liberal government\u2019s first concrete step toward easing tensions between the war-divided rivals.",
      "The South resumed the loudspeaker broadcasts in June last year following a yearslong pause in retaliation for North Korea flying trash-laden balloons toward the South in a psychological warfare campaign.",
      "South Korea\u2019s Defense Ministry said Wednesday that the move was part of efforts to \u201cto restore trust in inter-Korean relations and promote peace on the Korean Peninsula.\u201d",
      "North Korea, which is extremely sensitive to any outside criticism of its authoritarian leadership and its third-generation ruler, Kim Jong Un, didn't immediately comment on the step by Seoul.",
      "From May to November last year, North Korea flew about 7,000 balloons toward South Korea in 32 separate events to drop substances such as wastepaper, cloth scraps, cigarette butts and even manure. The North said that its balloon campaign came after South Korean activists sent over balloons filled with anti-North Korean leaflets, as well as USB sticks filled with popular South Korean songs and dramas.",
      "Trash carried by at least one North Korean balloon fell on the South Korean presidential compound in July, raising concerns about the vulnerability of key South Korean facilities. Officials said that the balloon contained no dangerous material and no one was hurt.",
      "South Korea, in response to the North Korean balloons, reactivated its front-line loudspeakers to blast propaganda messages and K-pop songs toward the North. The playlist was clearly designed to strike the nerve of Pyongyang, as Kim\u2019s government since the COVID-19 pandemic has been intensifying a campaign to eliminate the influence of South Korean pop culture and language among the population in a bid to strengthen his family\u2019s dynastic rule.",
      "The Cold War-style psychological warfare campaigns added to tensions fueled by North Korea\u2019s growing nuclear ambitions and South Korean efforts to expand joint military exercises with the United States and strengthen three-way security cooperation with Japan.",
      "South Korea\u2019s new liberal president, Lee Jae-myung, who took office last week after winning an early election to replace ousted conservative Yoon Suk Yeol, has vowed to improve relations with Pyongyang, which reacted furiously to Yoon\u2019s hard-line policies and shunned dialogue.",
      "During the election campaign, Lee promised to halt the loudspeaker broadcasts, arguing that they created unnecessary tensions and discomfort for South Korean residents in border towns. In recent months, those residents had complained about North Korea\u2019s retaliatory broadcasts, which included howling animals, pounding gongs and other irritating sounds.",
      "In a briefing on Monday, South Korea\u2019s Unification Ministry, which handles inter-Korean affairs, also called for South Korean civilian activists to stop flying anti-North Korean propaganda leaflets across the border. Such activities \u201ccould heighten tensions on the Korean Peninsula and threaten the lives and safety of residents in border areas,\u201d said Koo Byoungsam, the ministry\u2019s spokesperson.",
      "In his inaugural address last week, Lee vowed to reopen communication channels with North Korea to ease tensions. But prospects for an early resumption of dialogue between the rival Koreas remain dim, as North Korea has consistently rejected offers from South Korea and the United States since 2019, when nuclear talks between Washington and Pyongyang collapsed over sanctions-related disagreements.",

      "Yoon, who was removed from office in April over his short-lived imposition of martial law in December, had focused on strengthening military partnerships with Washington and Tokyo and on securing stronger U.S. assurances of a swift and decisive nuclear response to defend the South against a North Korean attack.",
      "In a fierce reaction to Yoon\u2019s policies, Kim in January 2024 declared that he was abandoning the long-standing goals of a peaceful unification with the South and instructed the rewriting of the North\u2019s constitution to cement the South as a permanent \u201cprincipal enemy.\u201d",

      "Spain\u2019s economy minister Carlos Cuerpo says the millions of tourists who visit the country every year pose a challenge for Spain's residents that the government can no longer afford to ignore",
      "MADRID -- Spain's economy minister says the millions of tourists who visit the country every year present a challenge for Spain's residents that the government can no longer afford to ignore.",
      "Last year, Spain received a record 94 million international visitors, making it one of the most visited countries in the world. It could receive as many as 100 million tourists this year, according to some projections.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s important to understand that these record numbers in terms of tourism also pose challenges,\u201d Economy Minister Carlos Cuerpo said in an interview Tuesday with The Associated Press. \u201cAnd we need to deal with those challenges also for our own population.\u201d",
      "Tourism is a key sector for the Southern European nation's economy, which grew faster than any major advanced economy last year at 3.2%, and is projected to grow at 2.4% this year, according to the Bank of Spain, well ahead of the expected eurozone average of 0.9%.",
      "But a stubborn housing crisis in which home and rental costs have skyrocketed in cities such as Madrid, Barcelona and elsewhere has led to growing frustration about one aspect tied to tourism in particular: the proliferation of short-term rental apartments in city centers.",
      "The country has seen several large protests that have drawn tens of thousands of people to demand more government action on housing. Signs at demonstrations with slogans such as \u201cGet Airbnb out of our neighborhoods\u201d point to the growing anger.",
      "In response, the government recently announced it was cracking down on Airbnb listings that it said were operating in the country illegally, a decision that the company is appealing.",
      "\u201cWe are a 49 million-inhabitants country,\" Cuerpo said. The record numbers of tourists illustrate the \u201cattractiveness of our country, but also of the challenge that we have in terms of dealing and providing for a good experience for tourists, but at the same time avoiding overcharging (for) our own services and our own housing,\u201d he said.",
      "The Bank of Spain recently said the country has a deficit of 450,000 homes. Building more public housing is critical to solve the problem, Cuerpo said. Spain has a lower stock of public housing than many other major European Union countries.",
      "\u201cThis is the key challenge for this term,\u201d the minister said of the country's housing woes.",
      "On the possibility of more U.S. tariffs on EU goods, the top economic policymaker for the eurozone's fourth-largest economy said he believed the EU still wanted to reinforce economic ties with the U.S.",
      "\u201cFrom the EU side, we are constructive but we are not naive,\" Cuerpo said, adding that the bloc would pursue \u201cother routes protecting our firms and industries\u201d if no agreement with the Trump administration can be reached.",
      "A 90-day pause on tariffs announced by the EU and the U.S. is slated to end on July 14. About halfway through that grace period, U.S. President Donald Trump announced 50% tariffs on steel imports. The U.S. has also enacted a 25% tariff on vehicles and 10% so-called reciprocal tariffs on most other goods.",
      "On how Spain's current housing woes got here, the minister said a steep drop in construction in Spain following the 2008 financial crisis played a role. So did population growth due to immigration, Cuerpo said, and pressures from an increase in the number of tourists.",
      "While building more housing is key, the minister advocated for an all-of-the-above approach, including regulating Spain's housing market and short-term rental platforms.",
      "\u201cFor us, there\u2019s no silver bullet,\u201d he said.",

      "The decision by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit extends a similar ruling it made after another federal court struck down the tariffs May 28, saying Trump had overstepped his authority. Noting that the challenges to Trump's tariffs raise \"issues of exceptional importance,'' the appeals court said it would expedite the case and hear arguments July 31.",
      "The case involves 10% tariffs the president imposed on almost every country in April and bigger ones he imposed and then suspended on countries with which the United States runs trade deficits. It also involves tariffs Trump plastered on imports from China, Canada and Mexico to pressure them to do more to stop the illegal flow of immigrants and synthetic opioids across the U.S. border.",

      "A federal judge has tossed out a lawsuit over President Donald Trump's dismantling of a U.S. federal agency that invests in African small businesses.",
      "U.S. District Judge Richard Leon in Washington, D.C., dismissed the case on Tuesday, finding that Trump was acting within his legal authority when he fired the U.S. African Development Foundation's board members in February. In March, the same judge ruled that the administration's removal of most grant money and staff from the congressionally created agency was also legal, as long as the agency was maintained at the minimum level required by law.",
      "USADF was created as an independent agency in 1980, and its board members must be confirmed by the U.S. Senate. In 2023, Congress allocated $46 million to the agency to invest in small agricultural and energy infrastructure projects and other economic development initiatives in 22 African countries.",
      "On Feb. 19, Trump issued an executive order that said USADF, the U.S. Institute of Peace, the Inter-American Foundation and the Presidio Trust should be scaled back to the minimum presence required by law. At the time, USADF had five of its seven board seats filled. A few days later, an administration official told Ward Brehm that he was fired, and emails were sent to the other board members notifying them that they had also been terminated.",
      "Those emails were never received, however, because they were sent to the wrong email addresses. The four board members, believing they still held their posts because they had not been given notice, met in March and passed a resolution appointing Brehm as the president of the board.",
      "But Trump had already appointed Pete Marocco as the new chairman of what the administration believed to now be a board of one. Since then, both men have claimed to be the president of the agency, and Brehm filed the lawsuit March 6.",
      "Leon said that even though they didn't receive the emails, the four board members were effectively terminated in February, and so they didn't have the authority to appoint Brehm to lead the board.",
      "Brehm\u2019s attorney, Bradley Girard with Democracy Forward, expressed disappointment with the judge's decision.",
      "\u201cBut in our parallel case, Rural Development Innovations v.

      "That lawsuit is still pending before the same judge. In that case, two USADF staffers and a consulting firm based in Zambia that works closely with USADF contend that the Trump administration's efforts to deeply scale back the agency wrongly usurps Congress' powers. They also say Marocco was unlawfully appointed to the board, in part because he was never confirmed by the Senate as required.",

      "U.S. inflation likely picked up a bit last month as President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs start to bite, but lower prices for gas and possibly for air fares and used cars may limit the overall increase",
      "WASHINGTON -- U.S. inflation likely picked up a bit last month as President Donald Trump's tariffs start to bite, but lower prices for gas and possibly for air fares and used cars may limit the overall increase.",
      "The government's inflation report, to be released Wednesday, is forecast to show that consumer prices rose 2.5% in May compared with a year ago, according to economists surveyed by data provider FactSet. That would be the first increase in four months and up from 2.3% in April. Excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core prices are projected to have risen 2.9% in May from a year earlier, up from 2.8% in April.",
      "Trump's tariffs are expected to contribute to the uptick by raising the cost of some imports, including clothes, furniture, appliances, and possibly new cars. Many retailers and some consumer products companies have said they have plans to raise prices or have already done so to cover the cost of the import duties.",
      "On a monthly basis, prices are expected to have moved up 0.2% from April to May, while core prices are forecast to have increased 0.3%. At that pace, core prices would rise much faster than the Federal Reserve's 2% target. Economists and the inflation-fighters at the Fed focus on core inflation because it often provides a better sense of where inflation is headed.",
      "Inflation has cooled in the past year and, excluding the impact of tariffs, economists say it would be on track to return to the Fed's target, which would allow the central bank to cut its key interest rates. Yet core prices have been more stubborn and were stuck between 3.2% and 3.4% for nearly a year until February, when they started to decline a bit.",
      "Last week, the Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics, which compiles the inflation data, said it is reducing the amount of data it collects for each inflation report. Economists have expressed concern about the cutback, and while it isn't clear how sharp the reduction is, most analysts say it is likely to have a minor impact. Still, any reduction in data collection could make the figures more volatile.",
      "Nearly all economists expect Trump's duties will make many things more expensive in the second half of this year, including cars and groceries, though by how much is still uncertain. Trump has slapped 30% tariffs on all imports from China, plus a 10% baseline tariff on imported goods from every other country, and 50% import taxes on steel and aluminum.",
      "Given the potential for higher prices in the coming months, Fed Chair Jerome Powell and other Fed officials have made clear they will keep their key rate unchanged until they have a better sense of how tariffs will affect the economy.",
      "The full impact of the tariffs likely won't be felt until the second half of the year, analysts say, even though many tariffs have been in place, in one form or another, since March and April. There are several reasons it can take months for the duties to fully pass through into retail prices.",
      "To begin with, many companies tried to beat the clock by bringing in foreign goods before Trump\u2019s tariffs took effect, producing a flood of imports in March. As a result, they have stockpiled goods in warehouses that weren't hit by tariffs and so don't have to raise prices yet.",
      "Many companies also held off on hiking prices during the chaos of April and May, when Trump announced sweeping tariffs on imports from nearly 60 countries, only to put them on hold a week later. He also ramped up duties on China to 145%, essentially cutting off trade with the United States' third-largest trading partner. Imports fell sharply in April as a result. The U.S. and China last month agreed to lower duties, with the U.S. now taxing Chinese imports 30%.",
      "For many firms, it wasn't worth it to raise prices until they had a better sense of where tariffs would settle. It's possible some duties could fall further if the Trump administration is able to reach trade deals in negotiations with China, the European Union, Japan and other countries.",
      "Still, Bryan Eshelman, a partner and managing director at consulting firm AlixPartners, said higher prices \u201care coming.\u201d",
      "Eshelman expects that shoppers will start feeling the impact in July, and predicts prices for back-to-school items like clothing and backpacks could go up anywhere from 5% to 15%. Retailers may add surcharges tied to higher tariffs costs at the cash register starting in September, he said.",
      "\u201cI think that that\u2019s something that retailers are going to be loathe to pull out and do. And so I think they will wait to see how things unfold, \u201d he said.",
      "Most imported goods are actually parts or raw materials for larger products, such as the steel and aluminum goods now facing 50% duties. It will take time for those costs to filter through the supply chain and affect prices.",
      "Some stores, however, have already said they will implement higher prices, including Best Buy, Walmart and Lululemon.",
      "It was only last month when Trump ripped into Walmart after the nation\u2019s largest retailer boldly warned that prices are already starting to go up on items like bananas. Walmart\u2019s chief financial officer John David Rainey told The Associated Press that a car seat that currently sells for $350 at Walmart will likely cost customers another $100.",
      "Rainey also told analysts at an Oppenheimer investor conference on Monday that for some items, Walmart will reduce inventory by as much as 20% because it expects higher prices will reduce demand, and it doesn\u2019t want to be stuck with leftover inventory.",

      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 President Donald Trump likes to say he's bringing in trillions of dollars in investments from foreign countries, but a provision in his tax cuts bill could cause international companies to avoid expanding into the United States.",
      "The House-passed version of the legislation would allow the federal government to impose taxes on foreign-parented companies and investors from countries judged as charging \u201cunfair foreign taxes\u201d on U.S. companies.",
      "Known as Section 899, the measure could cause companies to avoid investing in the the U.S. out of concern they could face steep taxes. The fate of the measure rests with the Senate \u2014 setting off a debate about its prospects and impact.",
      "A new analysis by the Global Business Alliance, a trade group representing international companies such as Toyota and Nestl\u00e9, estimates that the provision would cost the U.S. 360,000 jobs and $55 billion annually over 10 years in lost gross domestic product. The analysis estimates that the tax could cut a third off the economic growth anticipated from the overall tax cuts by Congress' Joint Committee on Taxation.",
      "\"While proponents say this punitive tax hike is intended as a retaliatory measure against foreign governments, this report confirms that the real victims are American workers in states like North Carolina, South Carolina, Indiana, Tennessee and Texas,\" said Jonathan Samford, president and CEO of the Global Business Alliance.",
      "Republican Rep. Jason Smith of Missouri, chair of the House Ways and Means Committee, has defended the provision as protecting U.S. interests by giving the president a tool that can be used against countries with tax codes that, in the federal government's opinion, put American companies at a disadvantage.",
      "\u201cIf these countries withdraw these taxes and decide to behave, we will have achieved our goal,\" Smith said in a statement last week. \"It\u2019s just common sense. I urge my colleagues in the Senate to move quickly to pass this bill and protect Americans from economic bad actors around the world.\u201d",
      "The tax gets at a fundamental tension within Trump's policy agenda: a contradiction in the broad strokes of Trump simultaneously trying to tax imports and foreign profits at higher rates while also seeking investments from companies headquartered abroad.",
      "In late May, Trump defended his approach by saying that his tariffs were causing more countries to invest in the U.S. to avoid imports getting taxed. While some countries and companies have made announcements, there is not evidence of the investments pushing up spending on new factories as measured in the government's monthly report on construction spending.",
      "The Republican president said his tendency to impose steep tariffs, then retreat to lower rates, had succeeded.",
      "\u201cWe have $14 trillion now invested, committed to investing,\u201d Trump said then. \u201cYou know we have the hottest country anywhere in the world. I went to Saudi Arabia, the king told me, he said, you got the hottest -- we have the hottest country in the world right now.\u201d",
      "The Global Business Alliance was among the groups that signed a letter on Monday warning of the consequences of Section 899 to Senate Majority Leader John Thune of South Dakota and Senate Finance Committee Chairman Mike Crapo of Idaho, both Republicans.",
      "The Investment Company Institute, representing financial firms, said the provision \u201ccould limit foreign investment to the U.S. \u2014 a key driver of growth in American capital markets that ultimately benefits American families saving for their futures.\u201d",
      "The analysis performed by EY Quantitative Economics and Statistics notes there is a degree of uncertainty in how the taxes under Section 899 could be implemented. But they could be charged against companies based in countries that tax digital services, as is the case in parts of Europe.",
      "If the U.S. judged the taxes unfair, there would be a 30% tax rate on foreign companies' profits and income. People working in the U.S. for the companies who are not citizens could also be taxed, among other provisions.",
      "The possibility of the taxes and seemingly arbitrary nature by which they could be imposed is also a challenge, said Chye-Ching Huang, executive director of New York University's Tax Law Center.",
      "\u201cSection 899 creates a game of political chicken with trade partners that risks harming businesses, consumers, and workers in the hopes of securing US multinationals the ability to shift more of their profits out of the US to tax havens,\" Huang said in an email. \u201cIt\u2019s a high-risk strategy that could expand the damage of the failed tariff war.\u201d",
      "There could also be political repercussions if key states in Trump's political coalition from 2024 suffer layoffs or simply find job growth slowing. The Global Business Alliance finds job losses could amount to 44,200 in Florida, 27,700 in Pennsylvania, 24,500 in North Carolina and 23,500 in Michigan.",

      "The European Union wants to lower a cap on the price of Russian oil to deprive the Kremlin of profits to fund its war in Ukraine",
      "BRUSSELS -- The European Union wants to lower a cap on the price of Russian oil to deprive the Kremlin of extra profits to fund its war in Ukraine as part of a new raft of sanctions aimed at forcing Moscow to the negotiating table, senior officials said on Tuesday.",
      "EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas said the bloc is \u201cproposing to lower the oil price cap from $60 to $45, which is lower than the market price, and lowering the oil price cap will hit Russia\u2019s revenues hard.\u201d",
      "Kallas said the EU also wants to impose \u201csanctions on the Nord Stream pipelines to prevent Russia generating any revenue in the future. In this way, it sends a clear signal we are not going back to business as usual.\u201d",
      "All 27 EU member countries must all agree for the sanctions to enter force.",
      "In 2023, Ukraine\u2019s Western allies limited sales of Russian oil to $60 per barrel but the price cap was largely symbolic as most of Moscow\u2019s crude \u2014 its main moneymaker \u2014 cost less than that. Still, the cap was there in case oil prices rose.",
      "Oil income is the linchpin of Russia\u2019s economy, allowing President Vladimir Putin to pour money into the armed forces while avoiding worsening inflation for everyday people and a currency collapse.",
      "European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said she assumed that the price cap would be discussed and agreed among the leaders of the Group of Seven major world economic powers when they meet in Canada on June 15-17.",
      "She said the United States and its G7 partners realize \u201cthat the oil price has lowered so much that the effectiveness of the cap is to be questioned, and therefore we all want to lower the oil price from $60 per barrel down to $45 per barrel.\u201d",
      "The Nord Stream gas pipelines were built to carry Russian natural gas to Germany but are not in operation. They were sabotaged in 2022, but the source of the underwater explosions has remained a major international mystery.",
      "The Commission has said that it wants to impose sanctions on the operating consortium to discourage investors from trying to use the pipelines in future.",
      "The blasts happened as Europe attempted to wean itself off Russian energy sources following the Kremlin\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, and contributed to tensions that followed the start of the war.",
      "Von der Leyen noted on Tuesday that at the beginning of the war in 2022, \u201cRussia had 12 billion euros ($14 billion) of energy revenues from fossil fuels\" from Europe per month. \"And now we\u2019re down to 1.8 billion (euros).\u201d",
      "The new EU sanctions would also target Russia\u2019s banking sector, with the aim of limiting the Kremlin\u2019s ability to raise funds or carry out financial transactions. A further 22 Russian banks will be hit with measures, von der Leyen said.",
      "An export ban worth some 2.5 billion euros would also be imposed, and the assets frozen of more than 20 Russian and foreign companies alleged to be providing support to the Kremlin\u2019s war machine.",
      "Von der Leyen said the sanctions are aimed at forcing Russia into serious talks about peace with Ukraine. \u201cWe need a real ceasefire, and Russia has to come to the negotiating table with a serious proposal,\u201d she told reporters.",
      "The EU has imposed several rounds of sanctions on Russia since Putin ordered his troops into Ukraine in February 2022. Around 2,400 officials and \u201centities\u201d \u2013 often government agencies, banks and organizations \u2013 have been hit.",

      "The U.K. will invest 14.2 billion pounds ($19 billion) to build a new nuclear station to reduce its reliance on volatile international fossil fuel markets",
      "LONDON -- Britain will invest 14.2 billion pounds ($19 billion) to build a new nuclear station that will reduce the U.K.'s reliance on volatile international fossil fuel markets, the government said Tuesday.",
      "Officials said the investment will go into building the new Sizewell C nuclear power plant in Suffolk, on England's eastern coast, saying it will generate enough low-carbon electricity to power 6 million homes when it becomes operational in the 2030s.",
      "Prime Minister Keir Starmer said previous governments had dithered and delayed over nuclear power. No new nuclear plant has been opened in the U.K. since Sizewell B in 1995.",
      "\u201cHaving our own energy in this country that we control, gives us security, gives us independence, so (Russian President Vladimir) Putin can\u2019t put his boot on our throat,\" Starmer said. \u201cAnd it means that we can control the prices in a way that we haven\u2019t been able to in recent years, which has meant very high prices for businesses, for households and for families.\"",
      "The government also announced that Rolls-Royce is the preferred bidder to develop a number of small modular reactors, which it said can power around 3 million homes and help fuel power-hungry industries like AI data centers.",
      "The Treasury said building Sizewell C will create 10,000 jobs. The investment announced Tuesday is in addition to 3.7 billion pounds the U.K. government already committed to the project.",
      "Nuclear power is seen as an increasingly important electricity source as the government seeks to decarbonize Britain\u2019s electricity grid by 2030, replacing fossil fuels with low-carbon power.",
      "The U.K. also wants to reduce its dependence on imported oil and gas, especially in light of soaring energy prices following Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine.",
      "But critics have said nuclear plants are far more expensive and slow to build compared with renewable energy options such as solar and wind power. Environmental groups have also argued Sizewell C will damage local nature reserves that host wildlife like otters and marsh birds.",
      "About 300 people joined a protest against the development at the Suffolk site over the weekend.",
      "\u201cNet zero is supposed to happen by 2030 \u2014 there is no way this is going to be completed by then,\" said Jenny Kirtley, a local resident who chairs the campaign group Together Against Sizewell C.",

That marked a downgrade from the 2.3% U.S. growth it had forecast back for 2025 back in January.",
      "The bank also lopped 0.4 percentage points off its forecast for global growth this year. It now expects the world economy to expand just 2.3% in 2025, down from 2.8% in 2024.",
      "In a forward to the latest version of the twice-yearly Global Economic Prospects report, World Bank chief economist Indermit Gill wrote that the global economy has missed its chance for the \u201csoft landing\u2019\u2019 \u2014 slowing enough to tame inflation without generating serious pain \u2014 it appeared headed for just six months ago. \u201cThe world economy today is once more running into turbulence,\u201d Gill wrote. \u201cWithout a swift course correction, the harm to living standards could be deep.\u2019\u2019",
      "America\u2019s economic prospects have been clouded by Trump\u2019s erratic and aggressive trade policies, including 10% taxes \u2014 tariffs \u2014 on imports from almost every country in the world. These levies drive up costs in the U.S. and invite retaliation from other countries.",
      "The Chinese economy is forecast to see growth slow from 5% in 2024 to 4.5% this year and 4% next. The world\u2019s second-largest economy has been hobbled by the tariffs that Trump has imposed on its exports, by the collapse of its real estate market and by an aging workforce.",
      "The World Bank expects the 20 European countries that share the euro currency to collectively grow just 0.7% this year, down from an already lackluster 0.9% in 2024. Trump\u2019s tariffs are expected to hurt European exports. And the unpredictable way he rolls them out \u2014 announcing them, suspending them, coming up with new ones \u2014 has created uncertainty that discourages business investment.",
      "India is once again expected to the be world\u2019s fastest-growing major economy, expanding at a 6.3% clip this year. But that\u2019s down from 6.5% in 2024 and from the 6.7% the bank had forecast for 2025 in January. In Japan, economic growth is expected to accelerate this year \u2013 but only from 0.2% in 2024 to a sluggish 0.7% this year, well short of the 1.2% the World Bank had forecast in January.",
      "The World Bank seeks to reduce poverty and boost living standards by providing grants and low-rate loans to poor economies.",
      "Another multinational organization that seeks to promote global prosperity \u2014 the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development \u2014 last week downgraded its forecast for the U.S. and global economies.",

      "The Indonesian government says they have suspended four nickel mining operations in one of the country\u2019s top tourist destinations for diving and snorkeling",
      "JAKARTA, Indonesia -- The Indonesian government announced Tuesday they had suspended four nickel mining operations in Raja Ampat, one of the country\u2019s top tourist destinations for diving and snorkeling.",
      "\u201cStarting today, the government has revoked four mining operation permits in Raja Ampat,\u201d Minister for Energy and Mineral Resources Bahlil Lahadalia told reporters after a Cabinet meeting in the presidential palace in the capital, Jakarta.",
      "Raja Ampat, an archipelagic regency in Southwest Papua province, is spread over nearly 20,000 square kilometers (7,700 square miles) and is home to 75% of the world\u2019s coral species and more than 1,600 fish species. It is a designated UNESCO Global Geopark which includes marine conservation zones managed by the Ministry of Marine Affairs and Fisheries.",
      "Lahadalia said the decision came after an investigation by the Ministry of Environment uncovered \u201cseveral violations in the environmental context\u201d by four companies holding mining permits in Raja Ampat.",
      "None of the four companies had started nickel operations as they failed to gain government approval for their Work Plan and Expenditure Budget, Lahadalia said.",
      "Last week, Greenpeace Indonesia and Papuan Youth staged a peaceful protest during the Indonesia Critical Minerals Conference & Expo. They demanded the closure of five nickel mining companies operating in Raja Ampat, including PT Gag Nikel, a subsidiary of state-owned mining company PT Aneka Tambang.",
      "The government suspended nickel mining operations at four of the five companies. The fifth, Gag Nikel, has been allowed to continue its operations on Gag Island as it lies outside the geopark area, Lahadalia said. Gag Island is about 42 kilometers (26 miles) west of Piyanemo, a popular diving spot in Raja Ampat.",
      "Gag Nikel has a concession area of \u200b\u200b130 square kilometers (50 square miles). It produced around 3 million wet metric tons of nickel in 2024, and is expected to produce the same amount in 2025 and 2026.",
      "Lahadalia said Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto has instructed him, along with ministers for the environment and forestry, to closely monitor Gag Nikel's mining operation.",
      "\u201cWe are really serious in our intent to protect the environment in Raja Ampat,\" Lahadalia said. \u201cWe want to produce nickel that is environmentally friendly and acceptable (to the world\u2019s standard).\u201d",
      "Indonesia has the largest nickel reserves in the world and aims to dominate global nickel supply. Its nickel ore lies in shallow deposits, easily accessible when the rainforest is cut down.",
      "In 2023, the country was responsible for more than half the supply of nickel globally. The country has gone from having two nickel smelters to 27 over the last decade and plans to open 22 more, according to S&P Global Commodity Insights.",
      "Nickel was once known mainly for making stainless steel, but demand has skyrocketed as automakers like Tesla use it to make electric vehicle batteries and larger battery makers use it in clean electricity projects.",
      "Rapid growth of Indonesia's nickel industry has already led to environmental degradation across several regions on Sulawesi Island, said Greenpeace forest campaigner Iqbal Damanik.",
      "\u201cNow nickel mining is also threatening Raja Ampat, a place that is often called the last paradise on Earth,\u201d Damanik said.",
      "Over 500 hectares of forest and vegetation have been cleared for nickel mines on the West Papua islands of Gag, Kawe and Manuran, according to Greenpeace Indonesia.",
      "The three islands are classified as small islands. Indonesia\u2019s law on the management of coastal areas and small islands prohibits mining as it could lead to soil runoff and sedimentation that endangers coral reefs and marine ecosystems.",

The two each face up to 20 years in prison when sentenced later.",
      "Prosecutors had argued the two women ran a yearslong scheme that groomed adherents \u2014 many of them victims of sexual trauma \u2014 to do their bidding.",
      "They said Daedone, 57, of New York, and Cherwitz, 44, of California, used economic, sexual and psychological abuse, intimidation and indoctrination to force OneTaste members into sexual acts they found uncomfortable or repulsive, such as having sex with prospective investors or clients.",

    "summary": "Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney says that Canada will meet NATO&rsquo;s military spending guideline by early next year",
    "story": [
      "Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney says that Canada will meet NATO\u2019s military spending guideline by early next year",
      "TORONTO -- Canada will meet NATO's military spending guideline by early next year and diversify defense spending away from the United States, which he says no longer plays a predominant role on the world stage, Prime Minister Mark Carney said Monday.",
      "Carney said Canada will achieve NATO\u2019s spending target of 2% of gross domestic product five years earlier than it had previously planned.",
      "\u201cOur military infrastructure and equipment have aged, hindering our military preparedness,\" Carney said. \u201cOnly one of our four submarines is seaworthy. Less than half of our maritime fleet and land vehicles are operational. More broadly we are too reliant on the United States.\u201d",
      "According to NATO figures, Canada was estimated to be spending 1.33% of GDP on its military budget in 2023, below the 2% target that NATO countries have set for themselves. Canada previously said it was on track to meet NATO\u2019s spending target by the end of the decade.",
      "\u201cOur goal is to protect Canadians, not to satisfy NATO accountants,\u201d Carney said.",
      "The announcement of increased spending came as Canada is about to host U.S. President Donald Trump and other leaders at a summit of the Group of Seven leading industrialized nations in Alberta on June 15-17, and before the NATO summit in Europe. It also comes as NATO allies are poised to increase the commitment well beyond the 2% target.",
      "NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte said last week that most U.S. allies at NATO endorse Trump\u2019s demand that they invest 5% of gross domestic product on their defense needs and are ready to ramp up security spending even more.",
      "Carney has said that he intends to diversify Canada\u2019s procurement and enhance the country\u2019s relationship with the EU.",
      "\u201cWe should no longer send three quarters of our defense capital spending to America,\u201d Carney said in a speech at the University of Toronto. \u201cWe will invest in new submarines, aircraft, ships, armed vehicles and artillery, as well as new radar, drones and sensors to monitor the seafloor and the Arctic.\u201d",
      "Canada has been in discussions with the European Union to join an EU drive to break its security dependency on the United States, with a focus on buying more defense equipment, including fighter jets, in Europe. Carney\u2019s government is reviewing the purchase of U.S. F-35 fighter jets to see if there are other options.",
      "\u201cWe stood shoulder to shoulder with the Americans throughout the Cold War and in the decades that followed, as the United States played a predominant role on the world stage. Today, that predominance is a thing of the past,\u201d Carney said in French.",
      "He added that with the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, the United States became the global hegemon, noting its gravitational pull, always strong, became virtually irresistible and made the U.S. \u201cour closest ally and dominant trading partner.\u201d",
      "\u201cNow the United States is beginning to monetize its hegemony: charging for access to its markets and reducing its relative contributions to our collective security,\u201d Carney said.",
      "The prime minister said that \"a new imperialism threatens.\u201d",
      "\u201cMiddle powers compete for interests and attention, knowing that if they are not at the table, they will be on the menu,\" Carney said.",
      "Trump\u2019s calls to make Canada the 51st U.S. state have infuriated Canadians, and Carney won the job of prime minister after promising to confront the increased aggression shown by Trump.",
      "Carney said that the long-held view that Canada\u2019s geographic location will protect Canadians is becoming increasingly archaic.",
      "European allies and Canada have already been investing heavily in their armed forces, as well as on weapons and ammunition, since Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022.",

The Angels' Mike Trout hit the longest homer so far, a 484-foot shot against the Giants on April 19, while his teammate Logan O'Hoppe hit one 470 against A's on May 27.",
      "Judge hit one 468 feet against the Brewers on March 29, and 12 times in his career has a homer traveled at least 465.",
      "\u201cJust glad to get the two runs,\u201d Judge said, when asked whether he took a moment to marvel at his latest long ball. \u201cThere's no time. It's on to the next. You do something, you enjoy it for a moment and then you're on to the next.\u201d",
      "That approach seems to be working well for the two-time MVP, who also had a bloop single in the sixth inning to mark his 50th game out of 65 in which he's reached base multiple times. The only other players in the modern era to accomplish that feat also were Yankees: Babe Ruth in 1923, \u201824 and \u201927, and Lou Gehrig in 1936.",
      "As for the homers, Judge has hit 24 of them this season. Half of those have given New York the lead in a game.",
      "\u201cI mean, he just keeps impressing. Being able to watch him every day is a treat,\u201d said Max Fried, who allowed two runs on six hits over seven innings Tuesday night. \u201cThen when you see him day in and day out and get to know him, it's not surprising at all.\u201d",
      "Judge wound up 2 for 5 against the Royals, keeping his average at a league-best .396 \u2014 30 points higher than second-place Jacob Wilson of the A's. He also leads the league in on-base percentage, slugging percentage, hits and total bases.",
      "\u201cIf he keeps ascending from here, I won't be surprised,\u201d Boone said. \"The most amazing part of it is I feel like he's just playing well. I don't feel like he's been on fire at any point. That's what is amazing about it. He's out there playing well. Getting his hits, doing his thing. But in a lot of ways, I'm honestly waiting for him to catch fire. That's when it gets really scary.",
      "\u201cHe's playing in a different league,\u201d Boone added with another smile. \u201cHe needs to get called up.\u201d",

      "Brazil and Ecuador have qualified for the 2026 World Cup",
      "A goal by Vinicius J\u00fanior secured Brazil a place in the 2026 World Cup, quite a momentous home debut for Carlo Ancelotti as head coach.",
      "The once prolific duo at Real Madrid helped Brazil to a 1-0 win over Paraguay at Sao Paulo. Ecuador secured its place at next year's global tournament later Tuesday with a 0-0 draw at Peru.",
      "Defending champion Argentina, held to a 1-1 draw by Colombia, had already qualified and is assured of finishing atop South American qualifying.",
      "Ecuador and Brazil each have 25 points in the standings, but the Ecuadorians are in second spot based on victories. The two nations are 10 points behind Argentina but, crucially, more than six points clear of the seventh-place team with two games remaining in the qualifying campaign.",
      "The top six teams in South America earn direct entries to the 48-team World Cup.",
      "Chile will miss a third consecutive World Cup after losing 2-0 at Bolivia to remain last in 10-nation round-robin competition, a result that cost head coach Ricardo Gareca his job.",
      "Uruguay beat Venezuela at home 2-0, with goals from Rodrigo Aguirre and Giorgian de Arrascaeta, and edged closer to one of the direct spots with 24 points.",
      "Venezuela, with 18, is one ahead of Bolivia in the contest for seventh place that grants an intercontinental playoff berth.",
      "Lionel Messi had a quiet night in Argentina\u2019s draw with Colombia in Buenos Aires. Luis D\u00edaz opened the scoring for the visitors in the 24th minute. Enzo Fernandez was sent off in the 70th minute to the disappointment of more than 80,000 fans at the Monumental de Nunez Stadium.",
      "But Juli\u00e1n Alvarez scored the equalizer in the 81st with a low crossed shot.",
      "Ancelotti received some frustration from fans after Thursday\u2019s 0-0 draw with Ecuador, as his team focused on defending the entire match. The Italian coach, who turned 66 Tuesday, promised changes to make his team more aggressive at the NeoQuimica Arena.",
      "He was welcomed by 46,000 fans, including NBA star Gianni Antetokounmpo, who displayed a tifo in yellow and green that read \u201cParabens, Carleto\u201d (Happy birthday, Carleto in Portuguese).",
      "Gabriel Martinelli replaced midfielder Gerson and was one of the best players of the encounter. Raphinha returned after suspension and created many problems for Paraguay\u2019s defense. And Vinicius J\u00fanior was often seen as a targetman, sharing the duties with Matheus Cunha.",
      "A mistake by Paraguay\u2019s defense, a low cross by Cunha and a gentle touch by Brazil\u2019s new No. 10 produced the only goal of the match. \u201cIt is for you,\u201d the striker told the coach as he celebrated.",
      "Despite the low score, the hosts were much more aggressive than in most of its games in this World Cup qualifying campaign.",
      "\u201cWe needed to win here for our people. Now we have more time to work, see what we can improve,\u201d Vinicius said after the match. He won\u2019t play Brazil\u2019s next game in qualifying against Chile due to suspension. \u201cWe need to celebrate this. After September it is all about the World Cup.\u201d",
      "After the final whistle, a clip of Ancelotti's first days on the job was shown in big screens around the stadium. A raucous celebration erupted again, as if the Italian coach had brought new life to a team that only three months ago appeared lost and doomed.",
      "He said the team was balanced despite having four strikers. He also said that Cunha's role, as a playmaker, is the one he figures will be Neymar's if the veteran fully recovers his fitness.",
      "\u201cIt's no problem to play with three or four up front. We need 10 players to run, to sacrifice,\u201d Ancelotti said. \u201cRodrygo did this many times, I know him well. And Neymar will also do it.\u201d",
      "Chile\u2019s golden generation won two Copa America titles \u2014 in 2015 and \u201916 \u2014 but is out of contention for next year\u2019s expanded 48-team tournament.",
      "\u201cSad, I am feeling bad. Never lived something like this. We have to ask people to forgive us,\u201d veteran Chile striker Alexis S\u00e1nchez said. \u201cWe have to keep working. There\u2019s change already, the golden generation is buried, I am the only one left.\u201d",
      "Bolivia scored first via Miguel Terceros in the fifth minute and added a second in the 90th with Enzo Monteiro at the 4,150-meter high El Alto Stadium, outside La Paz.",
      "Gareca, the 67-year-old Argentinian coach who took Peru to the 2018 World Cup, told a post-game news conference he was leaving the team after a 17-match stretch that included four wins, four draws and nine losses.",
      "The South American qualifying tournament will finish in September. Uruguay and Paraguay each need one point to secure their direct spots. The Uruguayans will face Peru and Chile. The Paraguayans will take on Ecuador and Peru.",
      "Colombia, in sixth place with 22 points, will play for its World Cup future against Bolivia and Venezuela. Bolivia will seek its first chance to play at the World Cup since 1994 against the Colombians and then Brazil. Venezuela's rivals will be Argentina and Colombia.",

      "The 35-year-old appeared in 114 games last season, hitting .233 with 27 homers and 72 RBIs. He was at his best in the playoffs, when he hit seven homers over 14 games and was voted the MVP of the AL Championship Series.",
      "\u201cFor him, it's just getting his body built up and him being in a position to where he knows he's had enough at-bats and enough reps to be game-ready, to be season-ready,\u201d Boone said. \u201cAnd he's had a pretty big ramp-up.

      "INDIANAPOLIS -- Online abuse related to sports betting decreased during the NCAA's March Madness basketball tournaments compared with the prior year, but people involved in the competition still received more than 3,000 threatening messages, the NCAA said Tuesday.",
      "The NCAA hired Signify Group to monitor messages directed at athletes, coaches, game officials, selection committee members and others with official roles in the tournament. Signify used both artificial intelligence and human analysts to confirm the threats and, when necessary, report them to law enforcement.",
      "Overall, abuse related to sports betting was down 23%, the NCAA said in a news release.",
      "The men's March Madness bracket was notable this year for the scarcity of upsets, with all four No. 1 seeds advancing to the Final Four and Florida, a popular pick to win it all, claiming the national title. On the women's side, three top seeds made the national semifinals and No. 2 seed UConn, among the pre-tournament favorites, won the championship.",
      "The NCAA's analysis found that overall, abusive statements directed at people involved in the men's tournament increased by 140% \u2014 much of it directed at the selection committee and coaches \u2014 while abuse related to sports betting was down 36%.",
      "Abuse was down 83% on the women's side and betting-related abuse declined 66%.",

      "NEW YORK -- A year from the largest World Cup ever, there has been no announcement on general ticket sales, prices for most seats, location of a draw or security arrangements as FIFA has mostly avoided disclosing details of an event set for 16 stadiums across the United States, Mexico and Canada.",
      "There is uncertainty about whether fans from some nations will be welcome \u2014 11 of the venues are located in the U.S., where all matches will be played from the quarterfinals on.",
      "Security is a concern, too. At the last major soccer tournament in the U.S., the 2024 Copa America final at Miami Gardens, Florida, started 82 minutes late after spectators breached security gates.",
      "\u201cThat was certainly a reminder and a wake-up call if anybody needed it that those types of things are going to be used in terms of the ultimate assessment of whether this World Cup is successful,\" said former U.S. defender Alexi Lalas, now Fox's lead soccer analyst.",
      "U.S. President Donald Trump's travel ban on citizens from 12 nations exempted athletes, coaches, staff and relatives while not mentioning fans. Vice President JD Vance made what could be interpreted as a warning on May 6.",
      "\u201cOf course everybody is welcome to come and see this incredible event. I know we\u2019ll have visitors probably from close to 100 countries. We want them to come. We want them to celebrate. We want them to watch the game,\u201d he said. \u201cBut when the time is up they\u2019ll have to go home. Otherwise they\u2019ll have to talk to Secretary Noem,\u201d he added, speaking alongside Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem.",
      "The 1994 World Cup sparked the launch of Major League Soccer with 12 teams in 1996, and $50 million in World Cup profits seeded the U.S. Soccer Foundation, tasked with developing the sport\u2019s growth. MLS now has 30 teams, plays in 22 soccer specific stadiums and has club academies to grow the sport and improve talent.",
      "Next year\u2019s tournament will include 104 games, up from 64 from 1998 through 2022, and the 11 U.S. stadiums are all NFL homes with lucrative luxury suites and club seating. It also will be the first World Cup run by FIFA without a local organizing committee.",
      "\u201cThe legacy initiative of 2026 is around how we ensure that soccer is everywhere in this county,\" U.S. Soccer Federation CEO JT Batson said. \"How do we ensure that every American can walk, ride their bike or take public transit to a safe place to play soccer? How do we make it to where every school in America has soccer accessible to their students? And how do we make it to wherever every American can truly see themselves in the game?\u201d",
      "Interest in soccer has vastly increased in the U.S., with England's Premier League averaging 510,000 viewers per match window on NBC's networks last season and the European Champions League final drawing more than 2 million viewers in each of the past five years on CBS. However, CBS broadcast just 26 of 189 Champions League matches on TV in 2024-25 and streamed the rest.",
      "MLS drew about 12.2 million fans last year, second to 14.7 million in 2023-24 for the Premier League's 20 teams, but MLS has largely disappeared from broadcast TV since starting a 10-year contract with Apple TV+ in 2023. Apple spokesman Sam Citron said the company does not release viewer figures.",
      "In a fractured television landscape, different deals were negotiated by FIFA, UEFA, MLS, the NWSL, the USSF and the five major European leagues.",
      "\u201cYou basically have over 2,800 game windows per season aired in the United States and so that requires distribution largely on streaming platforms like Paramount+ or ESPN+, but it's difficult for new fan adoption and it makes reach kind of challenging,\u201d said Gerry Cardinale, managing partner of RedBird Capital Partners, which holds controlling interests in AC Milan and Toulouse and owns a non-controlling stake of Fenway Sports Group, parent of Liverpool. \u201cKids today are getting weaned on Premier League football and Serie A football, and when you watch that as a product, it\u2019s hard for MLS to compete.\u201d",
      "The 1994 World Cup, a 24-nation tournament, drew a record 3.58 million fans for 52 matches. Ticket prices ranged from $25-$75 for most first round games and $180-$475 for the final at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, California.",
      "FIFA, which has about 800 people working at an office in Coral Gables, Florida, says it will announce information on general tickets in the third quarter. It wouldn't say whether prices will be fixed or variable.",
      "Hospitality packages are available on FIFA's website through On Location. For the eight matches at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey, including the final on July 19, prices range from $25,800 to $73,200 per person.",
      "FIFA appears to be using variable pricing for this year's Club World Cup, played at 12 U.S. stadiums from June 14 to July 13, and some prices repeatedly have been slashed. Marriott Bonvoy, a U.S. Soccer Federation partner, has been offering free tickets to some of its elite members.",
      "Asked about Club World Cup ticket sales and team base camp arrangements, Manolo Zubiria, the World Cup\u2019s chief tournament officer, hung up four minutes and five questions into a telephone interview with The Associated Press. Brendan O\u2019Connell, the publicist who arranged the interview, wrote in an email to the AP: \u201cThe guest was not prepared for those questions.\u201d",
      "FIFA's media relations staff would not make FIFA president Gianni Infantino available to discuss the tournament.",
      "Ahead of the 1994 World Cup, FIFA announced in May 1992 the draw would take place at Las Vegas on Dec. 18 or 19, 1993. FIFA has not revealed plans for this year's draw but appears to be planning for Las Vegas on Dec. 5.",
      "Regular ticket sales began in February 1993 for the U.S. soccer family and general first- and second-round sales started that June. Fans submitted lottery applications in October 1993 for games from the quarterfinals on.",
      "While not detailing ticketing plans for next year's tournament, FIFA is spreading it beyond the host cites and lists about 60 possible base camps for teams to use, paired with hotels. Some are fancy \u2014 The Greenbrier Resort in White Sulphur Springs, West Virginia \u2014 and some more Spartan \u2014 the Courtyard by Marriott Mesa at Wrigleyville West in Arizona.",
      "Thousands of arrangements must be coordinated. Major League Baseball is drawing up its schedule to ensure that the four teams whose ballparks share parking lots with World Cup stadiums \u2014 in Arlington, Texas; Kansas City, Missouri; Philadelphia; and Seattle \u2014 won\u2019t play home games on the dates of tournament matches.",
      "Boris Gartner, CEO of La Liga North America, a joint venture of the Spanish soccer league and Relevent Sports, said the 2026 World Cup should be viewed as just another step in the sport's long-term growth in the United States.",
      "\u201cIf you have a clear understanding of the market and the audience, a clear understanding of the value that these properties bring to media companies, and you mix content with a commercial strategy, with the right media distribution strategy, this is something that will continue to grow over the next two decades,\" he said. \u201cIf more people are watching the NWSL, more people are going to be interested in soccer that could potentially end up watching a Bundesliga game or La Liga game.\u201d",

      "The wheels came off for the Edmonton Oilers in their 6-1 loss to the Florida Panthers in Game 3 of the Stanley Cup Final",
      "SUNRISE, Fla. -- Falling behind early, parading to the penalty box and losing grip of their composure, the Edmonton Oilers find themselves in an all-too-familiar position: trailing the Stanley Cup Final against the Florida Panthers.",
      "Not much went right for them in Game 3 on Monday night, a 6-1 blowout loss that put them down 2-1 in the series after taking the opener at home. Many of their 85 penalty minutes, the most by a team in the final in nearly four decades, came in garbage time, but there is far more concern about the mistakes that piled up to put them in a hole.",
      "\u201cWe didn\u2019t play very well,\u201d said Evander Kane, who was whistled for two of his three minor penalties in a miserable first period and got a misconduct late. \"That\u2019s evident. We have nobody to blame but ourselves. We can definitely be a lot better.\u201d",
      "Stuart Skinner got pulled after allowing five goals on 23 shots, but captain Connor McDavid acknowledged, \u201cI don\u2019t know how much we\u2019re going to put on Stu.\u201d The play in front of him was disjointed and disconnected, at 5 on 5, on the power play and on the penalty kill.",
      "If not for Skinner, the score could have gotten out of hand much earlier because the Western Conference champions had their worst showing since perhaps the first couple of games of the playoffs.",
      "\u201cIt was a weird game,\u201d McDavid said. \u201cObviously it wasn\u2019t our best \u2014 not our best at all. I don\u2019t think our best has shown up all series long. But it\u2019s coming. We\u2019ll shift the focus to finding a way to get a win in Game 4.\u201d",
      "Even with an extra day off before Game 4 on Thursday night, coach Kris Knoblauch scheduled practice for his team Tuesday afternoon. There is much to discuss and work on.",
      "\u201cCollectively, goaltender, defense, all our forwards, we all have to be better,\u201d Knoblauch said. \"They played a heck of a game, and we\u2019re going to have to raise ours.\u201d",
      "Being more disciplined is a good place to start.",
      "After giving up a goal to Brad Marchand 56 seconds in, Edmonton took four minor penalties in the first period. The dam eventually broke on a power-play goal that made it too tough a deficit to overcome.",
      "\u201cAlmost half the period you\u2019re killing, so it\u2019s not a good way to get into your game,\u201d McDavid said. \"Never got to our game.\u201d",
      "The Oilers' play was almost indistinguishable from how they've looked for much of this run, getting balanced scoring and star performances from McDavid and Draisaitl. Ill-timed defensive breakdowns proved costly, and guys lost their cool \u2014 like Jake Walman squirting water at Panthers players on their bench from his place on the visiting side.",
      "\u201cI obviously did that for a reason,\u201d Walman said, reluctant to explain why. \u201cIt\u2019s just gamesmanship, I guess.\u201d",
      "By the time brawls ensued in the third period, the game was out of hand. Players downplayed the margin of defeat, quick to try to spin their thoughts forward to what they need to do to tie the final.",
      "\u201cWe know what we\u2019re going to be up against,\u201d Skinner said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t change how we\u2019re going to respond again. We\u2019ve got two days to come back and I think there\u2019s some things that we\u2019re going to have to change.\u201d",
      "That could mean lineup changes and certainly some major adjustments by Knoblauch and his staff. The Oilers also need to be better prepared to play in Game 4, perhaps channeling the pain from back-to-back losses.",
      "\u201cLosing in the playoffs, whether it\u2019s in round 1 Game 1 or the Stanley Cup Final, it\u2019s never a good feeling, but we\u2019ve been here before,\" Kane said. \"We\u2019ve been down in series before, and we\u2019ve had tough losses. It will sting right now and we\u2019ll flush it tomorrow and get ready for Thursday.\u201d",

      "In a post on his X social media platform, Musk said the date could change because Tesla is \u201cbeing super paranoid about safety.\u201d",
      "Investors, Wall Street analysts and Tesla enthusiasts have been anticipating the rollout of the driverless cabs since Musk said earlier this year that the service would launch in Austin sometime in June.",
      "Last month, Musk told CNBC that the taxis will be remotely monitored at first and \u201cgeofenced\u201d to certain areas of the city deemed the safest to navigate. He said he expected to initially run 10 or so taxis, increase that number rapidly and start offering the service in Los Angeles, San Antonio, San Francisco and other cities.",
      "Musk has been promising fully autonomous, self-driving vehicles \u201cnext year\u201d for a decade, but the pressure is on now as Tesla actually begins to operate a self-driving taxi service. Sales of Tesla\u2019s electric vehicles have sagged due to increased competition, the retooling of its most popular car, the Model Y, and the fallout from Musk\u2019s turn to politics.",
      "The Austin rollout also comes after Musk had a public blowup with President Donald Trump over the administration\u2019s tax bill. Some analysts have expressed concern that Trump could retaliate by encouraging federal safety regulators to to step in at any sign of trouble for the robotaxis.",

      "The announcement \u2014 the first to publicly denounce a gaming app \u2014 indicates that authorities are widening the crackdown that has followed anti-government protests in 2019. Authorities have crushed or silenced many dissenting voices through prosecutions under the 2020 national security law imposed by Beijing and a similar, homegrown law enacted last year.",
      "In a statement, police warned residents against downloading the \u201cReversed Front: Bonfire\" application, saying those with the app installed might be seen as possessing a publication with a seditious intention.",

      "The game application was developed by ESC Taiwan, which did not immediately respond to The Associated Press' request for comment. On the application's Facebook page, the developer posted about surging searches for the game name and a Hong Kong broadcaster\u2019s news report about Tuesday\u2019s development.",
      "According to the application\u2019s introduction, players can assume the role of Hong Kong, Tibet, Uyghur, Taiwan or Cathaysian Rebel factions, among others, to overthrow the communist regime. They may also choose to lead the communists to defeat all enemies.",
      "The game\u2019s website says it \u201cis a work of nonfiction. Any similarity to actual agencies, policies or ethnic groups of the PRC in this game is intentional.\u201d",
      "On Tuesday night, the app was still available on Apple's App Store but not on the Google Play store. The game publisher last month said Google Play had taken the app down because it did not prohibit users from adopting hateful language in naming.",
      "Apple, Google and Meta have not immediately commented.",
      "After playing the game for about three months, Kuo Hao Fu in Taiwan said he found that its content uses a humorous approach to describe serious political issues. Fu disagreed with the police accusations, saying players can also choose to be part of the force representing China.",
      "\u201cThe Hong Kong police's actions demonstrate how Hong Kong's democratic freedoms have been controlled by the Chinese Communist Party,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen even this level cannot be tolerated, it completely destroys creative freedom in gaming.\u201d",
      "China considers Taiwan its own territory, to be brought under its control by force if necessary. Many Taiwanese in the self-ruled island showed concerns about Hong Kong's declining freedoms under Beijing's grip.",

      "Satellite photos show emperor penguins in one region of Antarctica declined 22% in the past 15 years",
      "WASHINGTON -- The population of emperor penguins in one part of Antarctica appears to be declining faster than previously thought, according to a new analysis of satellite imagery released Tuesday.",
      "The estimated population of 16 penguin colonies \u2014 visible in satellite photos taken between 2009 and 2024 \u2013 had declined 22% during that period mainly because of climate change that's shrinking the amount of available sea ice. It's unclear whether this drop is seen across the continent, scientists said.",
      "\u201cSea ice is very important for the penguins because they breed on sea ice and forage on sea ice,\u201d said Peter Fretwell with British Antarctic Survey, who helped analyze the data.",
      "Scientists previously estimated that the total emperor penguin population declined about 10% across all of Antarctica over the past decade and a half. The latest survey included a region covering the Antarctic Peninsula, Weddell Sea and Bellingshausen Sea.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s absolutely alarming that the numbers are so much worse than predicted,\u201d said Daniel Zitterbart, a penguin researcher at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, who was not involved in the study.",
      "There are uncertainties in the latest estimate. The analysis relies on a calculation of how densely the penguins are clustered in each area where they're detected in a single satellite photo taken each year.",
      "The colonies studied represent about 30% of the total emperor penguin population, which lives only in Antarctica. The loss of stable sea ice may be affecting the penguins in ways beyond shrinking their breeding grounds.",
      "\u201cMore predators like leopard seals and orcas may be able to come in closer to the colonies if sea ice breaks up earlier in the year,\u201d said Fretwell.",
      "Warming ocean temperatures and changing rainfall patterns may also impact the survival of penguin chicks, he added.",

Wearing only rubber gloves and an outfit suitable for a yoga class, she approaches with soothing words. \u201cAll right, baby,\" she coos as she deftly drapes a towel over his head, grabs him by the scruff of his neck, scoops up his wounded legs and moves him to a clean cage.",

      "\u201cYou can never predict what you\u2019re going to arrive at,\u201d Townsend said.",
      "While not as visible as phone boxes or double-decker buses, the red fox is a fixture in London, a city not known for its wildlife. But living on the streets, alleys and back gardens of a dense urban environment can be rough and when foxes need help, they have their own ambulance service \u2014 and Townsend may be on her way.",
      "The foxes didn't invade London so much as adapt and expand their range inward as the city spread to their habitat in the 1930s and suburbs grew.",
      "But people and the bushy-tailed member of the canine family have not always lived in harmony, and the species has admirers and adversaries.",
      "For everyone enchanted seeing a fox trotting nonchalantly down their street at dusk or basking in a sunny backyard, there are plenty who see them as pests. They poop where they like, tear into garbage and the vixens in heat let out terrifying shrieks in the dead of winter when attracting a mate.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s like Marmite with foxes,\u201d Townsend said, referring to the food spread that is an acquired and divisive taste. \u201cYou either love them or hate them.\u201d",
      "The divide between the two camps led Trevor Williams to found what became The Fox Project nearly 35 years ago.",
      "Once a bass player in the rock group Audience that opened for Led Zeppelin and Pink Floyd, Williams had been active in the campaign to stop fox hunting when he redirected his protection efforts to the city, where foxes were once routinely killed.",
      "\u201cBecause of the myths that have occurred over the years, there\u2019s still a lot of suspicion about what foxes might be,\u201d Williams said. \u201cYou know, they\u2019re going to bite the baby, they\u2019re going to eat the cat, they\u2019re going to run away with your husband.\u201d",
      "The project has since grown from providing information on deterring foxes to rescuing 1,400 a year, including 400 cubs, though only about half survive to be released.",
      "There are estimated to be 15,000 foxes in London. The project covers a swath of south London and its leafy suburbs while other organizations not devoted solely to foxes handle other parts of the city.",
      "While the omnivores survive on small animals, bugs and berries in the wild, they favor easily scavenged leftovers in the city and handouts that make them more dependent on humans.",
      "Their main urban menaces are cars, getting snagged in soccer nets or getting stuck in tight spaces. In their effort to get free, they often get nasty abrasions that can become infected. Many also suffer from mange, a parasitic infestation that leads to all kinds of problems.",
      "Townsend pilots her VW Caddy on city streets, highways and narrow lanes that roll through lush hills, responding to calls about injured or ill foxes or cubs that have lost their mothers.",
      "She's seen a bit of everything since her first humbling call 2 1/2 years ago when the supposedly injured fox bolted.",
      "\u201cIn my inexperience, I chased after him, which is comical because you\u2019re never going to outrun a fox,\u201d she said. \u201cI just remember he ran very fast and I looked silly running after him.\u201d",
      "Despite many challenging situations \u2014 she once managed to rescue a fox that lost its footing atop a fence and ended upside down at eye level with its paw lodged between boards \u2014 she's only been bitten once.",
      "Her van carries the distinctly musky scent of foxes. The odor becomes unpleasant when an anxious passenger in a litter of cubs relieves itself enroute to being delivered to a foster care pen where they will stay until being released in the wild.",
      "\u201cFeel free to open the window,\u201d said Townsend, who is accustomed to the stench. \u201cThis is a stinky job.\"",
      "On a recent day, she was dispatched to meet a heartbroken couple who found a cub with a puncture wound collapsed on their back lawn.",
      "\u201cWe thought he was asleep at first, so we went to go and have a close look because we love them,\" Charlotte English said. \u201cThen he just didn\u2019t move, so we knew something was wrong.\u201d",
      "That cub had to be put to sleep, as did the adult Townsend transferred at the start of her shift.",
      "Cubs that recover are socialized in packs of five until they mature and are then released in a rural location while the adults are freed in the neighborhoods where they were found.",
      "Given a second chance, it's not clear how well the foxes fare, because they are rarely tracked. A 2016 study in the journal Applied Animal Behaviour Science found that rehabilitated foxes were more likely to behave as if they had been displaced when returned to their original territory. They were tracked wandering farther away, potentially exposing them to more traffic and greater stress.",
      "\u201cIt is a gap in the knowledge and there\u2019s an assumption that when you release them, they thrive and I think that that assumption needs to be challenged more,\u201d said Bryony Tolhurst, a University of Brighton honorary research fellow and lead author of the study.",
      "For Townsend, fox deaths are offset by the joy of seeing little ones venture into the unknown or an adult darting into a neighborhood it instantly recognizes.",
      "\u201cSometimes they look back and people like to romanticize that they\u2019re saying \u2018thank you,'\" she said. \"They\u2019re just making sure we\u2019re not chasing after them.\u201d",

      "Financial aid fraud is exploding, thanks to the rise of artificial intelligence",
      "It was an unusual question coming from a police officer. Heather Brady was napping at home in San Francisco on a Sunday afternoon when the officer knocked on her door to ask: Had she applied to Arizona Western College?",
      "She had not, and as the officer suspected, somebody else had applied to Arizona community colleges in her name to scam the government into paying out financial aid money.",
      "When she checked her student loan servicer account, Brady saw the scammers hadn't stopped there. A loan for over $9,000 had been paid out in her name \u2014 but to another person \u2014 for coursework at a California college.",
      "\u201cI just can\u2019t imagine how many people this is happening to that have no idea,\u201d Brady said.",
      "The rise of artificial intelligence and the popularity of online classes have led to an explosion of financial aid fraud. Fake college enrollments have been surging as crime rings deploy \u201cghost students\u201d \u2014 chatbots that join online classrooms and stay just long enough to collect a financial aid check.",
      "In some cases, professors discover almost no one in their class is real. Students get locked out of the classes they need to graduate as bots push courses over their enrollment limits. And victims of identity theft who discover loans fraudulently taken out in their names must go through months of calling colleges, the Federal Student Aid office and loan servicers to try to get the debt erased.",
      "On Friday, the U.S. Education Department introduced a temporary rule requiring students to show colleges a government-issued ID to prove their identity. It will apply only to first-time applicants for federal student aid for the summer term, affecting some 125,000 borrowers. The agency said it is developing more advanced screening for the fall.",
      "\u201cThe rate of fraud through stolen identities has reached a level that imperils the federal student aid program,\u201d the department said in its guidance to colleges.",
      "An Associated Press analysis of fraud reports obtained through a public records request shows California colleges in 2024 reported 1.2 million fraudulent applications, which resulted in 223,000 suspected fake enrollments. Other states are affected by the same problem, but with 116 community colleges, California is a particularly large target.",
      "Criminals stole at least $11.1 million in federal, state and local financial aid from California community colleges last year that could not be recovered, according to the reports.",
      "Colleges typically receive a portion of the loans intended for tuition, with the balance going directly to students for other expenses. Community colleges are targeted in part because their lower tuition means larger percentages of grants and loans go to borrowers.",
      "Scammers frequently use AI chatbots to carry out the fraud, targeting courses that are online and allow students to watch lectures and complete coursework on their own time.",
      "In January, Wayne Chaw started getting emails about a class he never signed up for at De Anza Community College, where he had taken coding classes a decade earlier. Identity thieves had obtained his Social Security number and collected $1,395 in financial aid in his name.",
      "The energy management class required students to submit a homework assignment to prove they were real. But someone wrote submissions impersonating Chaw, likely using a chatbot.",
      "\u201cThis person is typing as me, saying my first and last name. ... It\u2019s very freaky when I saw that,\u201d said Chaw.",
      "The fraud involved a grant, not loans, so Chaw himself did not lose money. He called the Social Security Administration to report the identity theft, but after five hours on hold, he never got through to a person.",
      "As the Trump administration moves to dismantle the Education Department, federal cuts may make it harder to catch criminals and help victims of identity theft. In March, the Trump administration fired more than 300 people from the Federal Student Aid office, and the department\u2019s Office of Inspector General, which investigates fraud, has lost more than 20% of its staff through attrition and retirements since October.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m just nervous that I\u2019m going to be stuck with this,\u201d Brady said. \u201cThe agency is going to be so broken down and disintegrated that I won\u2019t be able to do anything, and I\u2019m just going to be stuck with those $9,000\u201d in loans.",
      "Criminal cases around the country offer a glimpse of the schemes' pervasiveness.",
      "In the past year, investigators indicted a man accused of leading a Texas fraud ring that used stolen identities to pursue $1.5 million in student aid. Another person in Texas pleaded guilty to using the names of prison inmates to apply for over $650,000 in student aid at colleges across the South and Southwest. And a person in New York recently pleaded guilty to a $450,000 student aid scam that lasted a decade.",
      "Brittnee Nelson of Shreveport, Louisiana, was bringing her daughter to day care two years ago when she received a notification that her credit score had dropped 27 points.",
      "Loans had been taken out in her name for colleges in California and Louisiana, she discovered. She canceled one before it was paid out, but it was too late to stop a loan of over $5,000 for Delgado Community College in New Orleans.",
      "Nelson runs her own housecleaning business and didn\u2019t go to college. She already was signed up for identity theft protection and carefully monitored her credit. Still, her debt almost went into collections before the loan was put in forbearance. She recently got the loans taken off her record after two years of effort.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s like if someone came into your house and robbed you,\u201d she said.",
      "The federal government's efforts to verify borrowers' identity could help, she said.",
      "\u201cIf they can make these hurdles a little bit harder and have these verifications more provable, I think that\u2019s really, really, really going to protect people in the long run,\u201d she said.",
      "Delgado spokesperson Barbara Waiters said responsibility for approving loans ultimately lies with federal agencies.",
      "\u201cThis is an unfortunate and serious matter, but it is not the direct or indirect result of Delgado\u2019s internal processes,\u201d Waiters said.",
      "In San Francisco, the loans taken out in Brady's name are in a grace period, but still on the books. That has not been her only challenge. A few months ago, she was laid off from her job and decided to sign up for a class at City College San Francisco to help her career. But all the classes were full.",
      "After a few weeks, Brady finally was able to sign up for a class. The professor apologized for the delay in spots opening up: The college has been struggling with fraudulent applications.",

The lawsuit comes as a biotechnology company seeks the court's approval to buy the struggling firm.",
      "Biological samples, DNA data, health-related traits and medical records are too sensitive to be sold without each person\u2019s express, informed consent, Oregon Attorney General Dan Rayfield said in a news release about the lawsuit. Customers should have the right to control such deeply personal information and it cannot be sold like ordinary property, it said.",
      "23andMe customers use saliva-based DNA testing kits to learn about their ancestry and find long-lost relatives. Founded in 2006, the company also conducted health research and drug development. But it struggled to find a profitable business model since going public in 2021. In March it laid off 40% of its staff and filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the Eastern District of Missouri, raising concerns about the safety of customer data.",
      "Regeneron Pharmaceuticals said last month it aimed to buy the company for $256 million. Regeneron said it would comply with 23andMe\u2019s privacy policies and applicable law. It said it would process all customer personal data in accordance with the consents, privacy policies and statements, terms of service, and notices currently in effect and have security controls in place designed to protect such data.",

      "President Donald Trump\u2019s media company just announced a plan to raise $2.5 billion to buy bitcoin, joining a growing number of so-called \u201cbitcoin treasury companies\u201d as the world\u2019s most popular cryptocurrency hits all-time highs.",
      "The companies buy bitcoin for different reasons: Some hold it as a hedge against inflation or to signal support for the cryptocurrency industry, while some firms have made using debt and stock sales to buy bitcoin their primary business strategy.",
      "\u201cThe world at large has no idea what\u2019s happening and they\u2019re in for a big shock,\u201d Dylan LeClair, an executive at the Japan-based Metaplanet, which recently went from being a budget hotel firm to a bitcoin treasury company, said at a recent crypto conference. \u201cThis is a one-way train, nothing is going to stop this.\u201d",
      "The massive increases in some firms\u2019 stock price may seem to validate LeClair\u2019s bravado, but there are plenty of warnings that a downturn in bitcoin\u2019s prices could lead to large selloffs.",
      "Here\u2019s a look at bitcoin treasury companies by the numbers:",
      "That\u2019s how many bitcoins owned by MicroStrategy \u2013 the undisputed goliath of bitcoin treasury companies.",
      "With nearly 3% of the total bitcoin supply, MicroStrategy owns more bitcoins than every other bitcoin treasury company combined. It also owns more bitcoin than every nation state combined, according to the tracking site bitcointreasuries.net.",
      "Now called Strategy, the software company first started buying bitcoin in 2020 with reserve cash. Now, its software business is a small part of a perpetual bitcoin-buying machine that uses a variety of strategies \u2013 like selling shares or issuing debt \u2013 to keep growing its bitcoin holdings.",
      "That\u2019s how much MicroStrategy\u2019s stock price has increased in the last five years, compared to around 1,000% gain in bitcoin and the 1,500% jump for chipmaker and stock market darling Nvidia during that same period.",
      "The company\u2019s success has boosted the profile of MicroStrategy\u2019s founder and chairman, Michael Saylor, who has visited Trump at Mar-a-Lago and the White House while becoming bitcoin\u2019s enigmatic high priest.",
      "\u201cBitcoin is a swarm of cyber hornets serving the goddess of wisdom, feeding on the fire of truth, exponentially growing ever smarter, faster, and stronger behind a wall of encrypted energy,\u201d Saylor said in a social media post.",
      "Saylor\u2019s success has also spawned many imitators.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s kind of shocking \u2026 that it took someone four years after Michael Saylor started doing it to finally do it and pull the trigger and now it feels like everyone\u2019s pulling the trigger,\u201d said Eric Semler, the chairman of Semler Scientific, a healthcare company that started acquiring bitcoin last year.",
      "That\u2019s the average purchase price of bitcoin for half of the 61 publicly traded bitcoin strategy companies, excluding bitcoin mining companies and bitcoin exchange-traded funds, according to a recent analysis by Standard Chartered.",
      "Geoff Kendrick, the bank\u2019s head of digital assets research, said in the report that restrictions on investors buying bitcoin directly help explain the popularity of bitcoin treasury companies, as their stocks can serve as bitcoin proxies. But as crypto becomes more mainstream, the case for investing in bitcoin treasury companies becomes weaker, Kendrick said.",
      "He added that bitcoin\u2019s volatility could force some newer bitcoin treasury companies to sell their holdings to satisfy their debts if it falls under the purchase price.",
      "\u201cThe question then becomes, how much pain can companies withstand before being forced to sell their BTC?\u201d Kendrick said, referring to the symbol for bitcoin.",

      "Nintendo's Switch 2 video-game console is out, and it makes some substantial improvements over its predecessor",
      "WASHINGTON -- I'm cruising around Bowser's Castle with my old pal Toad. It's not exactly relaxing, what with all the lava pits and banana peels and turtle shells littering the road. Add 23 other characters \u2014 is that a cow driving? \u2014 who are trying to get to the finish line first, and it's chaos.",
      "The hectic, high-speed insanity of any race in the new Mario Kart World would have caused the eight-year-old Switch console to wheeze a bit. And that's why we've got the Switch 2 ($449.99), the souped-up sequel to Nintendo's popular home-and-portable hybrid.",
      "It looks prettier, too. The 7.9-inch portable display (up from 6.2 inches) boosts the resolution to 1020p (from 720p), and while the LCD screen isn't quite as sharp as an OLED screen might have been, it's much cleaner than the original recipe Switch. It looks even better when connected to an HDTV since it now supports 4K and HDR.",
      "Nintendo has always stood apart from the technological arms race that fans of Sony\u2019s PlayStation and Microsoft\u2019s Xbox obsess over, insisting that first-rate games don\u2019t necessarily depend on high-powered computer chips. But you could feel the strain in 2023\u2019s The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, with its at-times blurry graphics and sluggish framerate. The Switch 2, with a faster framerate of 120 fps, corrects much of the fuzziness.",
      "That's not to say it comes close to matching the high-definition performance of the PlayStation 5 or the Xbox X/S. If you're expecting the jaw-dropping graphics of, say, Ubisoft's Assassin's Creed Shadows ... well, no.",
      "There is good news for those of us who have gotten weary of the old Switch's dinky 32 gigabytes of internal storage. The Switch 2 multiplies that by eight, for 256 GB. Of course, flashier games take up more space, so if you want more room you'll have to invest in a microSD Express card \u2014 which is a bit pricier than the standard memory card used in most portable devices.",
      "The Switch 2's Joy-Con controllers have undergone some tinkering. As before, you can attach them to the sides of the screen if you're playing on the go. If you're at home, you can attach them to a doohickey that feels more like a traditional joystick. Either way, they're now more firmly connected with magnets, which provide a satisfying snap.",
      "Both the left and right Joy-Cons now include an optical mouse, which you can use by placing the controller on its edge and rolling it around on a table. (Nintendo says you can also use it on your pants, but I prefer using a clipboard on my lap.) It remains to be seen how many Switch 2 games will call for a mouse, but 2K's port of Sid Meier's Civilization VII seems like a good candidate.",
      "And then there's a new button labeled \u201cC\u201d on the right-hand Joy-Con. That calls up GameChat, which lets you start up a conversation with other players \u2014 provided you've all taken the time to register yourselves as friends. (Eventually, you'll also need to subscribe to the Nintendo Switch Online service, but that requirement doesn't kick in until March 31, 2026.) The microphone is built into the Switch 2, though if you want to upgrade to video chat, you'll need to buy a separate Nintendo camera.",
      "Finally, there\u2019s GameShare, which lets you play selected titles with other Switch users even if they don\u2019t own the software.",
      "Nintendo has been emphasizing the new social features in its marketing, though it feels like it's catching up to the competition. The kids I know who play Fortnite or Minecraft on competing consoles seem to have figured out long ago how to chat with their pals. Welcome to the 2010s?",
      "As with any console launch, the driving question is: Does it have the games?",
      "There are just a couple of Switch 2 exclusives out now: Mario Kart World and Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour, a $10 demo package that really should have been free. There are some new-to-Nintendo ports of excellent titles like Split Fiction and Cyberpunk 2077. You can get upgrades of classics like the last two Legend of Zelda adventures. And the Switch 2 is fully backward-compatible, so you can play everything that came out for the Switch as well as a substantial library of older titles.",
      "There\u2019s no other machine that will let you play future installments of beloved franchises like Zelda, Super Mario Bros., Super Smash Bros. and Animal Crossing. None of those have been announced yet, but some marquee names \u2014 Donkey Kong and Kirby \u2014 will star in Switch 2 exclusives later this year.",
      "There\u2019s plenty of competition out there, though, and not just in the TV-connected console market Switch shares with the PlayStation and the Xbox. Nintendo no longer has the portable market to itself, thanks to Valve\u2019s SteamDeck. Some models of that device cost less than the Switch 2, and it already has a huge library of PC games. Meanwhile, Microsoft announced over the weekend that it's teaming up with Asus on the ROG Xbox Ally, a handheld that will be out before Christmas.",
      "Honestly, we\u2019ll probably have a better idea of the Switch\u2019s quality a few years down the line, after developers get a handle on what the new hardware can do. If you\u2019re dying to get back behind the wheel with Mario, Luigi and Princess Peach right now, though, you know what you need to do.",
      "\u2014\u2014",
      "A previous version of this story was corrected to say that the Switch 2 social options can be used without a subscription until March 31, 2026.",

      "Since 2024 started, Amazon has committed to about $10 billion apiece to data center projects in Mississippi, Indiana, Ohio and North Carolina as it ramps up its investment in infrastructure to compete with other tech giants to meet growing demand for artificial intelligence products.",
      "The rapid growth of cloud computing and artificial intelligence has fueled demand for data centers that need power to run servers, storage systems, networking equipment and cooling systems.",
      "The majority owner of the Susquehanna nuclear power plant, Talen Energy, announced last year that it had sold its data center to Amazon for $650 million in a deal to eventually provide 960 megawatts. That's 40% of the output of one of the nation's largest nuclear power plants, or enough to power more than a half-million homes.",
      "However, the arrangement between Talen and Amazon \u2014 called a \u201cbehind the meter\u201d connection \u2014 has been held up by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in the first such case to come before the agency.",
      "It has raised questions over whether diverting power to higher-paying customers will leave enough for others and whether it\u2019s fair to excuse big power users from paying for the grid.",
      "For Big Tech, plugging energy-hungry data centers directly into a power plant can take years off their development timelines and is a much faster route to procuring power than having to connect to the congested electricity grid.",
      "It\u2019s not clear when FERC, which blocked the deal on a procedural grounds, will decide the matter, leaving in limbo regulatory treatment of the deal and others that likely would follow.",
      "Already in Pennsylvania, Microsoft announced a deal with the owner of the shuttered Three Mile Island nuclear power plant to restart the reactor under a 20-year agreement to supply its data centers in four states with energy.",
      "Meanwhile, the owners of what was once Pennsylvania\u2019s biggest coal-fired power plant say they will turn it into a $10 billion natural gas-powered data center campus.",

      "\u201cWhat Stability did was inappropriate,\u201d Getty CEO Craig Peters told The Associated Press in 2023. He said creators of intellectual property should be asked for permission before their works are fed into AI systems rather than having to participate in an \u201copt-out regime.\"",

      "Stable Diffusion\u2019s roots trace to Germany, where computer scientists at Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich worked with the New York-based tech company Runway to develop the original algorithms.

      "After stumbling out of the starting gate in Big Tech\u2019s pivotal race to capitalize on artificial intelligence, Apple tried to regain its footing Monday during a developers conference that focused mostly on incremental advances and cosmetic changes in it...",
      "CUPERTINO, Calif. -- After stumbling out of the starting gate in Big Tech\u2019s pivotal race to capitalize on artificial intelligence, Apple tried to regain its footing Monday during an annual developers conference that focused mostly on incremental advances and cosmetic changes in its technology.",
      "The presummer rite, which attracted thousands of developers from nearly 60 countries to Apple's Silicon Valley headquarters, subdued compared with the feverish anticipation that surrounded the event in the last two years.",
      "Apple highlighted plans for more AI tools designed to simplify people's lives and make its products even more intuitive. It also provided an early glimpse at the biggest redesign of its iPhone software in a decade. In doing so, Apple executives refrained from issuing bold promises of breakthroughs that punctuated recent conferences, prompting CFRA analyst Angelo Zino to deride the event as a \u201cdud\u201d in a research note.",
      "In 2023, Apple unveiled a mixed-reality headset that has been little more than a niche product, and last year WWDC trumpeted its first major foray into the AI craze with an array of new features highlighted by the promise of a smarter and more versatile version of its virtual assistant, Siri \u2014 a goal that has yet to be realized.",
      "\u201cThis work needed more time to reach our high-quality bar,\u201d Craig Federighi, Apple\u2019s top software executive, said Monday at the outset of the conference. The company didn't provide a precise timetable for when Siri's AI upgrade will be finished but indicated it won't happen until next year at the earliest.",
      "\"The silence surrounding Siri was deafening,\" said Forrester Research analyst Dipanjan Chatterjee said. \u201cNo amount of text corrections or cute emojis can fill the yawning void of an intuitive, interactive AI experience that we know Siri will be capable of when ready. We just don\u2019t know when that will happen. The end of the Siri runway is coming up fast, and Apple needs to lift off.\u201d",
      "The showcase unfolded amid nagging questions about whether Apple has lost some of the mystique and innovative drive that has made it a tech trendsetter during its nearly 50-year history.",
      "Instead of making a big splash as it did with the Vision Pro headset and its AI suite, Apple took a mostly low-key approach that emphasized its effort to spruce up the look of its software with a new design called \u201cLiquid Glass\" while also unveiling a new hub for its video games and new features like a \u201cWorkout Buddy\u201d to help manage physical fitness.",
      "Apple executives promised to make its software more compatible with the increasingly sophisticated computer chips that have been powering its products while also making it easier to toggle between the iPhone, iPad, and Mac.",
      "\u201cOur product experience has become even more seamless and enjoyable,\u201d Apple CEO Tim Cook told the crowd as the 90-minute showcase wrapped up.",
      "IDC analyst Francisco Jeronimo said Apple seemed to be largely using Monday's conference to demonstrate the company still has a blueprint for success in AI, even if it's going to take longer to realize the vision that was presented a year ago.",
      "\u201cThis year\u2019s event was not about disruptive innovation, but rather careful calibration, platform refinement and developer enablement \u2014positioning itself for future moves rather than unveiling game-changing technologies,\u201d Jeronimo said.",
      "Besides redesigning its software. Apple will switch to a method that automakers have used to telegraph their latest car models by linking them to the year after they first arrive at dealerships. That means the next version of the iPhone operating system due out this autumn will be known as iOS 26 instead of iOS 19 \u2014 as it would be under the previous naming approach that has been used since the device's 2007 debut.",
      "The iOS 26 upgrade is expected to be released in September around the same time Apple traditionally rolls out the next iPhone models.",
      "Apple opened the proceedings with a short video clip featuring Federighi speeding around a track in a Formula 1 race car. Although it was meant to promote the June 27 release of the Apple film, \u201cF1\u201d starring Brad Pitt, the segment could also be viewed as an unintentional analogy to the company's attempt to catch up to the rest of the pack in AI technology.",
      "While some of the new AI tricks compatible with the latest iPhones began rolling out late last year as part of free software updates, the delays in a souped-up Siri became so glaring that the chastened company stopped promoting it in its marketing campaigns earlier this year.",
      "While Apple has been struggling to make AI that meets its standards, the gap separating it from other tech powerhouses is widening. Google keeps packing more AI into its Pixel smartphone lineup while introducing more of the technology into its search engine to dramatically change the way it works. Samsung, Apple's biggest smartphone rival, is also leaning heavily into AI. Meanwhile, ChatGPT recently struck a deal that will bring former Apple design guru Jony Ive into the fold to work on a new device expected to compete against the iPhone.",
      "Besides grappling with innovation challenges, Apple also faces regulatory threats that could siphon away billions of dollars in revenue that help finance its research and development. A federal judge is currently weighing whether proposed countermeasures to Google's illegal monopoly in search should include a ban on long-running deals worth $20 billion annually to Apple while another federal judge recently banned the company from collecting commissions on in-app transactions processed outside its once-exclusive payment system.",
      "On top of all that, Apple has been caught in the crosshairs of President Donald Trump's trade war with China, a key manufacturing hub for the Cupertino, California, company. Cook successfully persuaded Trump to exempt the iPhone from tariffs during the president's first administration, but he has had less success during Trump's second term, which seems more determined to prod Apple to make its products in the U.S.",
      "The multidimensional gauntlet facing Apple is spooking investors, causing the company's stock price to plunge by 20% so far this year \u2014 a decline that has erased about $750 billion in shareholder wealth. After beginning the year as the most valuable company in the world, Apple now ranks third behind longtime rival Microsoft, another AI leader, and AI chipmaker Nvidia.",
      "Apple's shares closed down by more than 1% on Monday \u2014 an early indication the company's latest announcements didn't inspire investors.",

      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014",
      "Cybersecurity investigators noticed a highly unusual software crash \u2014 it was affecting a small number of smartphones belonging to people who worked in government, politics, tech and journalism.",
      "The crashes, which began late last year and carried into 2025, were the tipoff to a sophisticated cyberattack that may have allowed hackers to infiltrate a phone without a single click from the user.",
      "The attackers left no clues about their identities, but investigators at the cybersecurity firm iVerify noticed that the victims all had something in common: They worked in fields of interest to China's government and had been targeted by Chinese hackers in the past.",
      "Foreign hackers have increasingly identified smartphones, other mobile devices and the apps they use as a weak link in U.S. cyberdefenses. Groups linked to China's military and intelligence service have targeted the smartphones of prominent Americans and burrowed deep into telecommunication networks, according to national security and tech experts.",
      "It shows how vulnerable mobile devices and apps are and the risk that security failures could expose sensitive information or leave American interests open to cyberattack, those experts say.",
      "\u201cThe world is in a mobile security crisis right now,\u201d said Rocky Cole, a former cybersecurity expert at the National Security Agency and Google and now chief operations officer at iVerify. \u201cNo one is watching the phones.\u201d",
      "U.S. authorities warned in December of a sprawling Chinese hacking campaign designed to gain access to the texts and phone conversations of an unknown number of Americans.",
      "\u201cThey were able to listen in on phone calls in real time and able to read text messages,\u201d said Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi of Illinois. He is a member of the House Intelligence Committee and the senior Democrat on the Committee on the Chinese Communist Party, created to study the geopolitical threat from China.",
      "Chinese hackers also sought access to phones used by Donald Trump and running mate JD Vance during the 2024 campaign.",
      "The Chinese government has denied allegations of cyberespionage, and accused the U.S. of mounting its own cyberoperations. It says America cites national security as an excuse to issue sanctions against Chinese organizations and keep Chinese technology companies from the global market.",
      "\u201cThe U.S. has long been using all kinds of despicable methods to steal other countries\u2019 secrets,\u201d Lin Jian, a spokesman for China\u2019s foreign ministry, said at a recent press conference in response to questions about a CIA push to recruit Chinese informants.",
      "U.S. intelligence officials have said China poses a significant, persistent threat to U.S. economic and political interests, and it has harnessed the tools of digital conflict: online propaganda and disinformation, artificial intelligence and cyber surveillance and espionage designed to deliver a significant advantage in any military conflict.",
      "Mobile networks are a top concern. The U.S. and many of its closest allies have banned Chinese telecom companies from their networks. Other countries, including Germany, are phasing out Chinese involvement because of security concerns. But Chinese tech firms remain a big part of the systems in many nations, giving state-controlled companies a global footprint they could exploit for cyberattacks, experts say.",
      "Chinese telecom firms still maintain some routing and cloud storage systems in the U.S. \u2014 a growing concern to lawmakers.",
      "\u201cThe American people deserve to know if Beijing is quietly using state-owned firms to infiltrate our critical infrastructure,\u201d U.S. Rep. John Moolenaar, R-Mich. and chairman of the China committee, which in April issued subpoenas to Chinese telecom companies seeking information about their U.S. operations.",
      "Mobile devices can buy stocks, launch drones and run power plants. Their proliferation has often outpaced their security.",
      "The phones of top government officials are especially valuable, containing sensitive government information, passwords and an insider's glimpse into policy discussions and decision-making.",
      "The White House said last week that someone impersonating Susie Wiles, Trump\u2019s chief of staff, reached out to governors, senators and business leaders with texts and phone calls.",
      "It\u2019s unclear how the person obtained Wiles\u2019 connections, but they apparently gained access to the contacts in her personal cellphone, The Wall Street Journal reported. The messages and calls were not coming from Wiles\u2019 number, the newspaper reported.",
      "While most smartphones and tablets come with robust security, apps and connected devices often lack these protections or the regular software updates needed to stay ahead of new threats. That makes every fitness tracker, baby monitor or smart appliance another potential foothold for hackers looking to penetrate networks, retrieve information or infect systems with malware.",
      "Federal officials launched a program this year creating a \u201ccyber trust mark\u201d for connected devices that meet federal security standards. But consumers and officials shouldn\u2019t lower their guard, said Snehal Antani, former chief technology officer for the Pentagon\u2019s Joint Special Operations Command.",

      "Mike Waltz, who departed as Trump's national security adviser, inadvertently added The Atlantic's editor-in-chief to a Signal chat used to discuss military plans with other top officials.",
      "Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth had an internet connection that bypassed the Pentagon\u2019s security protocols set up in his office so he could use the Signal messaging app on a personal computer, the AP has reported.",

      "A new study that examined five years\u2019 worth of prices at one U.S. grocery chain found that digital price tags haven\u2019t led to demand-based pricing surges",
      "Digital price labels, which are rapidly replacing paper shelf tags at U.S. supermarkets, haven\u2019t led to demand-based pricing surges, according to a new study that examined five years' worth of prices at one grocery chain.",
      "But some shoppers, consumer advocates and lawmakers remain skeptical about the tiny electronic screens, which let stores change prices instantly from a central computer instead of having workers swap out paper labels by hand.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s corporations vs. the humans, and that chasm between us goes further and further,\u201d said Dan Gallant, who works in sports media in Edmonton, Canada. Gallant's local Loblaws supermarket recently switched to digital labels.",
      "Social media is filled with warnings that grocers will use the technology to charge more for ice cream if it\u2019s hot outside, hike the price of umbrellas if it\u2019s raining or to gather information about customers.",
      "Democratic U.S. Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Bob Casey of Pennsylvania fired off a letter to Kroger last fall demanding to know whether it would use its electronic labels as part of a dynamic pricing strategy.",
      "Lawmakers in Rhode Island and Maine have introduced bills to limit the use of digital labels. In Arizona, Democratic state Rep. Cesar Aguilar recently introduced a bill that would ban them altogether.",
      "The bill hasn\u2019t gotten a hearing, but Aguilar said he\u2019s determined to start a conversation about digital labels and how stores could abuse them.",
      "\u201cGrocery stores study when people go shopping the most. And so you might be able to see a price go down one day and then go up another day,\u201d Aguilar told The Associated Press.",
      "Researchers say those fears are misplaced. A study published in late May found \u201cvirtually no surge pricing\u201d before or after electronic shelf labels were adopted. The study was authored by Ioannis Stamatopoulos of the University of Texas, Austin, Robert Evan Sanders of the University of California, San Diego and Robert Bray of Northwestern University",
      "The researchers looked at prices between 2019 and 2024 at an unnamed grocery chain than began using digital labels in October 2022. They found that temporary price increases affected 0.005% of products on any given day before electronic shelf labels were introduced, a share that increased by only 0.0006 percentage points after digital labels were installed.",
      "The study also determined that discounts were slightly more common after digital labels were introduced.",
      "Economists have long wondered why grocery prices don\u2019t change more often, according to Stamatopoulos. If bananas are about to expire, for example, it makes sense to lower the price on them. He said the cost of having workers change prices by hand could be one issue.",
      "But there\u2019s another reason: Shoppers watch grocery prices closely, and stores don\u2019t want to risk angering them.",
      "\u201cSelling groceries is not selling a couch. It\u2019s not a one-time transaction and you will never see them again,\u201d Stamatopoulos said. \u201cYou want them coming to the store every week.\u201d",
      "Electronic price labels aren\u2019t new. They\u2019ve been in use for more than a decade at groceries in Europe and some U.S. retailers, like Kohl's.",
      "But they\u2019ve been slow to migrate to U.S. grocery stores. Only around 5% to 10% of U.S. supermarkets now have electronic labels, compared to 80% in Europe, said Amanda Oren, vice president of industry strategy for North American grocery at Relex Solutions, a technology company that helps retailers forecast demand.",
      "Oren said cost is one issue that has slowed the U.S. rollout. The tiny screens cost between $5 and $20, Oren said, but every product a store sells needs one, and the average supermarket has 100,000 or more individual products.",
      "Still, the U.S. industry is charging ahead. Walmart, the nation's largest grocer and retailer, hopes to have digital price labels at 2,300 U.S. stores by 2026. Kroger is expanding the use of digital labels this year after testing them at 20 stores. Whole Foods is testing the labels in nearly 50 stores.",
      "Companies say electronic price labels have tremendous advantages. Walmart says it used to take employees two days to change paper price labels on the 120,000 items it has in a typical store. With digital tags, it takes a few minutes.",
      "The labels can also be useful. Some have codes shoppers can scan to see recipes or nutrition information. Instacart has a system in thousands of U.S. stores, including Aldi and Schnucks, that flashes a light on the digital tag when Instacart shoppers are nearby to help them find products.",
      "Ahold Delhaize\u2019s Albert Heijn supermarket chain in the Netherlands and Belgium has been testing an artificial intelligence-enabled tool since 2022 that marks down prices on its digital labels every 15 minutes for products nearing expiration. The system has reduced more than 250 tons of food waste annually, the company said.",
      "But Warren and Casey are skeptical. In their letter to Kroger, the U.S. senators noted a partnership with Microsoft that planned to put cameras in grocery aisles and offer personalized deals to shoppers depending on their gender and age.",
      "In its response, Kroger said the prices shown on its digital labels were not connected to any sort of facial recognition technology. It also denied surging prices during periods of peak demand.",
      "\u201cKroger\u2019s business model is built on a foundation of lowering prices to attract more customers,\u201d the company said.",
      "Aguilar, the Arizona lawmaker, said he also opposes the transition to digital labels because he thinks they will cost jobs. His constituents have pointed out that grocery prices keep rising even though there are fewer workers in checkout lanes, he said.",
      "\u201cThey are supposed to be part of our community, and that means hiring people from our community that fill those jobs,\" Aguilar said.",
      "But Relex Solutions' Oren said she doesn't think cutting labor costs is the main reason stores deploy digital price tags.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s about working smarter, not harder, and being able to use that labor in better ways across the store rather than these very mundane, repetitive tasks,\u201d she said.",

      "Maybe, that is. It all depends on Trump\u2019s appetite for revenge and how the dispute unfolds.",
      "Joked Telemetry Insight auto analyst Sam Abuelsamid, \u201cSince Trump has no history of retaliating against perceived adversaries, he\u2019ll probably just let this pass.\u201d",
      "Turning serious, he sees trouble ahead for Musk.",
      "\u201cFor someone that rants so much about government pork, all of Elon\u2019s businesses are extremely dependent on government largesse, which makes him vulnerable.\u201d",
      "Trump and the federal government also stand to lose from a long-running dispute, but not as much as Musk.",
      "The dispute comes just a week before a planned test of Tesla\u2019s driverless taxis in Austin, Texas, a major event for the company because sales of its EVs are lagging in many markets, and Musk needs a win.",
      "Trump can mess things up for Tesla by encouraging federal safety regulators to step in at any sign of trouble for the robotaxis.",
      "Even before the war of words broke out on Thursday, the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration requested data on how Musk\u2019s driverless, autonomous taxis will perform in low-visibility conditions. That request follows an investigation last year into 2.4 million Teslas equipped with full self-driving software after several accidents, including one that killed a pedestrian.",
      "A spokesman for NHTSA said the probe was ongoing and that the agency \"will take any necessary actions to protect road safety.\u201d",
      "The Department of Justice has also probed the safety of Tesla cars, but the status of that investigation is unclear. The DOJ did not respond immediately to requests for comment.",
      "The promise of a self-driving future led by Tesla inspired shareholders to boost the stock by 50% in the weeks after Musk confirmed the Austin rollout. But on Thursday, the stock plunged more than 14% amid the Trump-Musk standoff. On Friday, it recovered a bit, bouncing back nearly 4%.",
      "\u201cTesla\u2019s recent rise was almost entirely driven by robotaxi enthusiasm,\" said Morningstar analyst Seth Goldstein. \u201cElon\u2019s feud with Trump could be a negative.\u201d",
      "One often-overlooked but important part of Tesla\u2019s business that could take a hit is its sales of carbon credits.",
      "As Musk and Trump were slugging it out Thursday, Republican senators inserted new language into Trump\u2019s budget bill that would eliminate fines for gas-powered cars that fall short of fuel economy standards. Tesla has a thriving side business selling \u201cregulatory credits\u201d to other automakers to make up for their shortfalls.",
      "Musk has downplayed the importance of the credits business, but the changes would hurt Tesla as it reels from boycotts of its cars tied to Musk\u2019s time working for Trump.",
      "Credit sales jumped by a third to $595 million in the first three months of the year even as total revenue slumped.",
      "Musk\u2019s foray into right-wing politics cost Tesla sales among the environmentally minded consumers who embraced electric cars and led to boycotts of Tesla showrooms.",
      "If Musk has indeed ended his close association with Trump, those buyers could come back, but that\u2019s far from certain.",
      "Meanwhile, one analyst speculated earlier this year that Trump voters in so-called red counties could buy Teslas \u201cin a meaningful way.\u201d But he\u2019s now less hopeful.",
      "\u201cThere are more questions than answers following Thursday developments,\u201d TD Cowen\u2019s Itay Michaeli wrote in his latest report, \u201cand it\u2019s still too early to determine any lasting impacts.\u201d",
      "Michaeli\u2019s stock target for Tesla earlier this year was $388. He has since lowered it to $330. Tesla was trading Friday at $300.",
      "Tesla did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "Trump said Thursday that he could cut government contracts to Musk\u2019s rocket company, SpaceX, a massive threat to a company that has received billions of federal dollars.",
      "The privately held company that is reportedly worth $350 billion provides launches, sends astronauts into space for NASA and has a contract to send a team from the space agency to the moon next year.",
      "But if Musk has a lot to lose, so does the U.S.",
      "SpaceX is the only U.S. company capable of transporting crews to and from the space station, using its four-person Dragon capsules. The other alternative is politically dicey: depending wholly on Russia's Soyuz capsules.",
      "Musk knew all this when he shot back at Trump that SpaceX would begin decommissioning its Dragon spacecraft. But it is unclear how serious his threat was. Several hours later \u2014 in a reply to another X user \u2014 he said he wouldn\u2019t do it.",
      "A subsidiary of SpaceX, the satellite internet company Starlink, appears to also have benefited from Musk\u2019s once-close relationship with the president.",
      "Musk announced that Saudi Arabia had approved Starlink for some services during a trip with Trump in the Middle East last month. The company has also won a string of other recent deals in Bangladesh, Pakistan, India and elsewhere as Trump has threatened tariffs.",
      "It\u2019s not clear how much politics played a role, and how much is pure business.",
      "On Friday, The Associated Press confirmed that India had approved a key license to Starlink. At least 40% of India\u2019s more than 1.4 billion people have no access to the internet.",
      "Big advertisers that fled X after Musk welcomed all manner of conspiracy theories to the social media platform have started to trickle back in recent months, possibly out of fear of a conservative backlash.",
      "Musk has called their decision to leave an \u201cillegal boycott\u201d and sued them, and the Trump administration recently weighed in with a Federal Trade Commission probe into possible coordination among them.",
      "Now advertisers may have to worry about a different danger.",
      "If Trump sours on X, \"there\u2019s a risk that it could again become politically radioactive for major brands,\u201d said Sarah Kreps, a political scientist at Cornell University. She added, though, that an \u201cexodus isn\u2019t obvious, and it would depend heavily on how the conflict escalates, how long it lasts and how it ends.\u201d",

      "Artificial Intelligence\u2019s use in filmmaking is growing",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Artificial intelligence 's use in movie making is exploding. And a young film festival, now in its junior year, is showcasing what this technology can do on screen today.",
      "The annual AI Film Festival organized by Runway, a company that specializes in AI-generated video, kicked off in New York Thursday night with ten short films from around the world making their debut on the big screen.",
      "\u201cThree years ago, this was such a crazy idea,\u201d Runway CEO Crist\u00f3bal Valenzuela told the crowd. \u201cToday, millions of people are making billions of videos using tools we only dreamed of.\u201d",
      "The film festival itself has grown significantly since its 2023 debut. About 300 people submitted films when it first began, Valenzuela said, compared to about 6,000 submissions received this year.",
      "The one and half-hour lineup stretched across a range of creative styles and ambitious themes \u2014 with Jacob Alder's \u201c Total Pixel Space \" taking home the festival's top prize. The 9-minute and 28-second film questions how many possible images \u2014 real or not \u2014 exist in the digital space, and uses math to calculate a colossal number. A stunning series of images, ranging from the familiar life moments to those that completely bend reality, gives viewers a glimpse of what's out there.",
      "Meanwhile, Andrew Salter's \u201cJailbird,\" which snagged second place, chronicles a chicken's journey \u2014 from the bird's perspective \u2014 to a human prison in the United Kingdom to take part in a joint-rehabilitation program. And \u201cOne,\u201d a futuristic story by Ricardo Villavicencio and Edward Saatchi about interplanetary travel followed in third place.",
      "The 10 films shown were finalists selected from thousands submitted to Runway's AI Film Festival this year. The shorts will also be shown at screenings held in Los Angeles and Paris next week.",
      "How AI is used and executed is a factor judges evaluate when determining festival winners. But not every film entered was made entirely using AI. While submission criteria requires each movie include the use of AI-generated video, there's no set threshold, meaning some films can take a more \u201cmixed media\u201d approach \u2014 such as combining live shots of actors or real-life images and sounds with AI-generated elements.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re trying to encourage people to explore and experiment with it,\u201d Valenzuela said in an interview prior to Thursday's screening.",
      "Creating a coherent film using generative AI is no easy feat. It can take a long list of directions and numerous, detailed prompts to get even a short scene to make sense and look consistent. Still, the scope of what this kind of technology can do has grown significantly since Runway's first AI Film Festival in 2023 \u2014 and Valenzuela says that's reflected in today's submissions. While there are still limits, AI-generated video is becoming more and more life-like and realistic.",
      "Runway encourages the use of its own AI tools for films entered into its festival, but creators are also allowed to turn to other resources and tools as they put together the films \u2014 and across the industry, tools that use AI to create videos spanning from text, image and/or audio prompts have rapidly improved over recent years, while becoming increasingly available.",
      "\u201cThe way (this technology) has lived within film and media culture, and pop culture, has really accelerated,\u201d said Joshua Glick, an associate professor of film and electronic arts at Bard College.",
      "He adds that Runway's film fest, which is among a handful of showcases aimed at spotlighting AI's creative capabilities, arrives as companies in this space are searching for heightened \u201clegitimacy and recognition\u201d for the tools they are creating \u2014 with aims to cement partnerships in Hollywood as a result.",
      "AI's presence in Hollywood is already far-reaching, and perhaps more expansive than many moviegoers realize. Beyond \u201cheadline-grabbing\u201d (and at times controversial) applications that big-budget films have done to \u201cde-age\u201d actors or create eye-catching stunts, Glick notes, this technology is often incorporated in an array of post-production editing, digital touch-ups and additional behind-the-scenes work like sorting footage.",
      "Industry executives repeatedly point to how AI can improve efficiency in the movie making process \u2014 allowing creatives to perform a task that once took hours, for example, in a matter of minutes \u2014 and foster further innovation.",
      "Still, AI's rapid growth and adoption has also heightened anxieties around the burgeoning technology \u2014 notably its implications for workers.",
      "The International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees \u2014 which represents behind-the-scenes entertainment workers in the U.S. and Canada \u2014 has \u201clong embraced new technologies that enhance storytelling,\u201d Vanessa Holtgrewe, IATSE's international vice president, said in an emailed statement. \u201cBut we\u2019ve also been clear: AI must not be used to undermine workers\u2019 rights or livelihoods.\u201d",
      "IATSE and other unions have continued to meet with major studios and establish provisions in efforts to provide guardrails around the use of AI. The Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists has also been vocal about AI protections for its members, a key sticking point in recent labor actions.",
      "For Runway's AI Film Festival, Valenzuela hopes screening films that incorporate AI-generated video can showcase what's possible \u2014 and how he says this technology can help, not hurt, creatives in the work they do today.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s natural to fear change ... (But) it's important to understand what you can do with it,\" Valenzuela said. Even filmmaking, he adds, was born \u201cbecause of scientific breakthroughs that at the time were very uncomfortable for many people.\"",

      "Britain\u2019s competition regulator says Amazon has pledged to beef up its systems to combat fake online reviews",
      "LONDON -- Amazon has pledged to beef up fight against fake reviews, Britain's competition regulator said Friday after an investigation into whether big online platforms are doing enough to crack down on phony online ratings for products and services.",
      "The Competition and Markets Authority said it secured the \u201cundertakings\u201d from Amazon, after getting a similar agreement earlier this year from Google to clamp down on rogue reviews plaguing the internet.",
      "The company promised to strengthen its existing systems for fighting fake reviews. It will also tackle catalog abuse, which involves sellers boosting star ratings for a product by hijacking good reviews from a completely different one.",
      "As an example, a shopper might come across a pair of headphones with a five-star rating. But, after looking closer, most of the reviews are for a mobile phone charger, the watchdog said.",
      "As part of its commitments, Amazon has agreed to sanction anyone caught using these tactics. Businesses could be banned from selling on the Amazon website and users posting fake reviews could be banned from posting them, the CMA said.",
      "The watchdog's chief executive, Sarah Cardell, said that so many people shop on Amazon and \u201cstar ratings and reviews have a huge impact on their choices.\u201d",
      "Amazon's pledges \u201cmean people can make decisions with greater confidence \u2013 knowing that those who seek to pull the wool over their eyes will be swiftly dealt with.\u201d",
      "The pledges apply to Amazon's U.K. website. The company said in a statement that it has zero tolerance for fake reviews and that the measures build on Amazon's existing efforts to tackle them.",
      "\u201cWe invest significant resources to proactively stop fake reviews ever appearing on our store, including on expert human investigators and machine learning models that analyse thousands of data points to detect risk,\" the company said.",
      "The CMA opened its investigations into Amazon and Google in 2021 to examine whether the two companies broke U.K. consumer law by failing to protect shoppers. It began looking into phony reviews on some big websites amid the boom in online shopping fueled by the coronavirus pandemic.",

      "PROVIDENCE, R.I. -- President Donald Trump\u2019s pick to be the next U.S. surgeon general has repeatedly said the nation\u2019s medical, health and food systems are corrupted by special interests and people out to make a profit at the expense of Americans\u2019 health.",
      "Yet as Dr. Casey Means has criticized scientists, medical schools and regulators for taking money from the food and pharmaceutical industries, she has promoted dozens of health and wellness products \u2014 including specialty basil seed supplements, a blood testing service and a prepared meal delivery service \u2014 in ways that put money in her own pocket.",
      "A review by The Associated Press found Means, who has carved out a niche in the wellness industry, set up deals with an array of businesses.",
      "In her newsletter, on her social media accounts, on her website, in her book and during podcast appearances, the entrepreneur and influencer has at times failed to disclose that she could profit or benefit in other ways from sales of products she recommends. In some cases, she promoted companies in which she was an investor or adviser without consistently disclosing the connection, the AP found.",
      "Means, 37, has said she recommends products that she has personally vetted and uses herself. She is far from the only online creator who doesn\u2019t always follow federal transparency rules that require influencers to disclose when they have a \u201cmaterial connection\u201d to a product they promote.",
      "Still, legal and ethics experts said those business entanglements raise concerns about conflicting interests for an aspiring surgeon general, a role responsible for giving Americans the best scientific information on how to improve their health.",
      "\u201cI fear that she will be cultivating her next employers and her next sponsors or business partners while in office,\u201d said Jeff Hauser, executive director of the Revolving Door Project, a progressive ethics watchdog monitoring executive branch appointees.",
      "The nomination, which comes amid a whirlwind of Trump administration actions to dismantle the government\u2019s public integrity guardrails, also has raised questions about whether Levels, a company Means co-founded that sells subscriptions for devices that continuously monitor users\u2019 glucose levels, could benefit from this administration\u2019s health guidance and policy.",
      "Though scientists debate whether continuous glucose monitors are beneficial for people without diabetes, U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has promoted their use as a precursor to making certain weight-loss drugs available to patients.",
      "The aspiring presidential appointee has built her own brand in part by criticizing doctors, scientists and government officials for being \u201cbought off\u201d or \u201ccorrupt\u201d because of ties to industry.",
      "Means' use of affiliate marketing and other methods of making money from her recommendations for supplements, medical tests and other health and dietary products raise questions about the extent to which she is influenced by a different set of special interests: those of the wellness industry.",
      "Means earned her medical degree from Stanford University, but she dropped out of her residency program in Oregon in 2018, and her license to practice is inactive. She has grown her public profile in part with a compelling origin story that seeks to explain why she left her residency and conventional medicine.",
      "\u201cDuring my training as a surgeon, I saw how broken and exploitative the healthcare system is and left to focus on how to keep people out of the operating room,\u201d she wrote on her website.",
      "Means turned to alternative approaches to address what she has described as widespread metabolic dysfunction driven largely by poor nutrition and an overabundance of ultra-processed foods. She co-founded Levels, a nutrition, sleep and exercise-tracking app that can also give users insights from blood tests and continuous glucose monitors. The company charges $199 per year for an app subscription and an additional $184 per month for glucose monitors.",
      "Means has argued that the medical system is incentivized not to look at the root causes of illness but instead to maintain profits by keeping patients sick and coming back for more prescription drugs and procedures.",
      "\u201cAt the highest level of our medical institutions, there are conflicts of interest and corruption that are actually making the science that we\u2019re getting not as accurate and not as clean as we\u2019d want it,\u201d she said on Megyn Kelly's podcast last year.",
      "But even as Means decries the influence of money on science and medicine, she has made her own deals with business interests.",
      "During the same Megyn Kelly podcast, Means mentioned a frozen prepared food brand, Daily Harvest. She promoted that brand in a book she published last year. What she didn\u2019t mention in either instance: Means had a business relationship with Daily Harvest.",
      "Influencer marketing has expanded beyond the beauty, fashion and travel sectors to \u201cencompass more and more of our lives,\u201d said Emily Hund, author of \u201cThe Influencer Industry: The Quest for Authenticity on Social Media.\u201d",
      "With more than 825,000 followers on Instagram and a newsletter that she has said reached 200,000 subscribers, Means has a direct line into the social media feeds and inboxes of an audience interested in health, nutrition and wellness.",
      "Affiliate marketing, brand partnerships and similar business arrangements are growing more popular as social media becomes increasingly lucrative for influencers, especially among younger generations. Companies might provide a payment, free or discounted products or other benefits to the influencer in exchange for a post or a mention. But most consumers still don\u2019t realize that a personality recommending a product might make money if people click through and buy, said University of Minnesota professor Christopher Terry.",
      "\u201cA lot of people watch those influencers, and they take what those influencers say as gospel,\u201d said Terry, who teaches media advertising and internet law. Even his own students don\u2019t understand that influencers might stand to benefit from sales of the products they endorse, he added.",
      "Many companies, including Amazon, have affiliate marketing programs in which people with substantial social media followings can sign up to receive a percentage of sales or some other benefit when someone clicks through and buys a product using a special individualized link or code shared by the influencer.",
      "Means has used such links to promote various products sold on Amazon. Among them are books, including the one she co-wrote, \u201cGood Energy\"; a walking pad; soap; body oil; hair products; cardamom-flavored dental floss; organic jojoba oil; a razor set; reusable kitchen products; sunglasses; a sleep mask; a silk pillowcase; fitness and sleep trackers; protein powder and supplements.",
      "She also has shared links to products sold by other companies that included \u201caffiliate\u201d or \u201cpartner\u201d coding, indicating she has a business relationship with the companies. The products include an AI-powered sleep system and Daily Harvest, for which she curated a \u201cmetabolic health collection.\u201d",
      "On a \u201cMy Faves\u201d page that was taken down from her website shortly after Trump picked her, Means wrote that some links \u201care affiliate links and I make a small percentage if you buy something after clicking them.\u201d",
      "It's not clear how much money Means has earned from her affiliate marketing, partnerships and other agreements. Daily Harvest did not return messages seeking comment, and Means said she could not comment on the record during the confirmation process.",
      "Means has raised concerns that scientists, regulators and doctors are swayed by the influence of industry, oftentimes pointing to public disclosures of their connections. In January, she told the Kristin Cavallari podcast \u201cLet\u2019s Be Honest\u201d that \u201crelationships are influential.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s huge money, huge money going to fund scientists from industry,\" Means said. \"We know that when industry funds papers, it does skew outcomes.\u201d",
      "In November, on a podcast run by a beauty products brand, Primally Pure, she said it was \u201cinsanity\u201d to have people connected to the processed food industry involved in writing food guidelines, adding, \u201cWe need unbiased people writing our guidelines that aren\u2019t getting their mortgage paid by a food company.\u201d",
      "On the same podcast, she acknowledged supplement companies sponsor her newsletter, adding, \u201cI do understand how it\u2019s messy.\u201d",
      "Influencers who endorse or promote products in exchange for payment or something else of value are required by the Federal Trade Commission to make a clear and conspicuous disclosure of any business, family or personal relationship. While Means did provide disclosures about newsletter sponsors, the AP found in other cases Means did not always tell her audience when she had a connection to the companies she promoted. For example, a \u201cClean Personal & Home Care Product Recommendations\u201d guide she links to from her website contains two dozen affiliate or partner links and no disclosure that she could profit from any sales.",
      "Means has said she invested in Function Health, which provides subscription-based lab testing for $500 annually. Of the more than a dozen online posts the AP found in which Means mentioned Function Health, more than half did not disclose she had any affiliation with the company.",
      "Means also listed the supplement company Zen Basil as a company for which she was an \u201cInvestor and/or Advisor.\u201d The AP found posts on Instagram, X and on Facebook where Means promoted its products without disclosing the relationship.",
      "Though the \u201cAbout\u201d page on her website discloses an affiliation with both companies, that\u2019s not enough, experts said. She is required to disclose any material connection she has to a company anytime she promotes it.",
      "Representatives for Function Health did not return messages seeking comment through their website and executives' LinkedIn profiles. Zen Basil's founder, Shakira Niazi, did not answer questions about Means' business relationship with the company or her disclosures of it. She said the two had known each other for about four years and called Means' advice \u201ctransformational,\u201d saying her teachings reversed Niazi's prediabetes and other ailments.",
      "\u201cI am proud to sponsor her newsletter through my company,\u201d Niazi said in an email.",
      "While the disclosure requirements are rarely enforced by the FTC, Means should have been informing her readers of any connections regardless of whether she was violating any laws, said Olivier Sylvain, a Fordham Law School professor who was previously a senior adviser to the FTC chair.",
      "\u201cWhat you want in a surgeon general, presumably, is someone who you trust to talk about tobacco, about social media, about caffeinated alcoholic beverages, things that present problems in public health,\u201d Sylvain said, adding, \u201cShould there be any doubt about claims you make about products?\u201d",
      "Means isn\u2019t the first surgeon general nominee whose financial entanglements have raised eyebrows.",
      "Jerome Adams, who served as surgeon general from 2017 to 2021, filed federal disclosure forms that showed he invested in several health technology, insurance and pharmaceutical companies before taking the job \u2014 among them Pfizer, Mylan and UnitedHealth Group. He also invested in the food and drink giant Nestle.",
      "He divested those stocks when he was confirmed for the role and pledged that he and his immediate family would not acquire financial interest in certain industries regulated by the Food and Drug Administration.",
      "Vivek Murthy, who served as surgeon general twice, under Presidents Barack Obama and Joe Biden, made more than $2 million in COVID-19-related speaking and consulting fees from Carnival, Netflix, Estee Lauder and Airbnb between holding those positions. He pledged to recuse himself from matters involving those parties for a period of time.",
      "Means has not yet gone through a Senate confirmation hearing and has not yet announced the ethical commitments she will make for the role.",
      "Hund said that as influencer marketing becomes more common, it is raising more ethical questions, such as what past influencers who enter government should do to avoid the appearance of a conflict.",
      "Other administration officials, including Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Administrator Dr. Mehmet Oz, have also promoted companies on social media without disclosing their financial ties.",
      "\u201cThis is like a learning moment in the evolution of our democracy,\u201d Hund said. \u201cIs this a runaway train that we just have to get on and ride, or is this something that we want to go differently?\u201d",

      "Elon Musk is threatening to decommission a capsule used to take astronauts and supplies to the International Space Station for NASA",
      "As President Donald Trump and Elon Musk argued on social media on Thursday, the world's richest man threatened to decommission a space capsule used to take astronauts and supplies to the International Space Station.",
      "After Trump threatened to cut government contracts given to Musk's SpaceX rocket company and his Starlink internet satellite services, Musk responded via X that SpaceX \"will begin decommissioning its Dragon spacecraft immediately.\u201d",
      "It's unclear how serious Musk's threat was. But the capsule, developed with the help of government contracts, is an important part of keeping the space station running. NASA also relies heavily on SpaceX for other programs including launching science missions and, later this decade, returning astronauts to the surface of the moon.",
      "SpaceX is the only U.S. company capable right now of transporting crews to and from the space station, using its four-person Dragon capsules.",
      "Boeing\u2019s Starliner capsule has flown astronauts only once; last year\u2019s test flight went so badly that the two NASA astronauts had to hitch a ride back to Earth via SpaceX in March, more than nine months after launching last June.",
      "Starliner remains grounded as NASA decides whether to go with another test flight with cargo, rather than a crew.",
      "SpaceX also uses a Dragon capsule for its own privately run missions. The next one of those is due to fly next week on a trip chartered by Axiom Space, a Houston company.",
      "Cargo versions of the Dragon capsule are also used to ferry food and other supplies to the orbiting lab.",
      "Russia\u2019s Soyuz capsules are the only other means of getting crews to the space station right now.",
      "The Soyuz capsules hold three people at a time. For now, each Soyuz launch carries two Russians and one NASA astronaut, and each SpaceX launch has one Russian on board under a barter system. That way, in an emergency requiring a capsule to return, there is always someone from the U.S. and Russian on board.",
      "With its first crew launch for NASA in 2020 \u2014 the first orbital flight of a crew by a private company \u2014 SpaceX enabled NASA to reduce its reliance on Russia for crew transport. The Russian flights had been costing the U.S. tens of millions of dollars per seat, for years.",
      "NASA has also used Russian spacecraft for cargo, along with U.S. contractor Northrup Grumman.",
      "The company has used its rockets to launch several science missions for NASA as well as military equipment.",
      "Last year, SpaceX also won a NASA contract to help bring the space station out of orbit when it is no longer usable.",
      "SpaceX\u2019s Starship mega rocket is what NASA has picked to get astronauts from lunar orbit to the surface of the moon, at least for the first two landing missions. Starship made its ninth test flight last week from Texas, but tumbled out of control and broke apart.",

      "Pope Leo XIV has made his first appointment of a Chinese bishop",
      "VATICAN CITY -- VATICAN CITY (AP) \u2014 Pope Leo XIV made his first appointment of a Chinese bishop under the Vatican\u2019s 2018 agreement with Beijing, signalling he is continuing one of Pope Francis\u2019 most controversial foreign policy decisions.",
      "The Vatican expressed satisfaction that Leo\u2019s June 5 nomination of Bishop Joseph Lin Yuntuan as auxiliary bishop of Fuzhou was recognized Wednesday by Chinese authorities.",
      "The Vatican said in a statement that Lin taking possession of the diocese and the civic recognition of his appointment \u201cconstitutes a further fruit of the dialogue between the Holy See and the Chinese authorities and is a significant step in the diocese\u2019s communal journey.\u201d",
      "Francis had riled conservatives when he approved a deal in 2018 over bishop nominations, which had been the most divisive issue in Vatican-China relations since diplomatic ties were severed when the Communists came to power. China had insisted on an exclusive right to name bishops as a matter of national sovereignty, while the Vatican asserted the pope\u2019s exclusive right to name the successors of the original Apostles.",
      "China's estimated 12 million Catholics have been divided between an official, state-controlled church that didn\u2019t recognize papal authority and an underground church that remained loyal to Rome through decades of persecution. The Vatican tried for decades to unify the flock and the 2018 deal was aimed at healing that division, regularizing the status of seven bishops who weren\u2019t recognized by Rome and thawing decades of estrangement between China and the Vatican.",
      "The details of the 2018 deal were never released, but it affords the state-controlled church a say in its church leaders, though Francis insisted he retained veto power over the ultimate choice.",
      "The deal has been criticized by some, especially on the Catholic right, for having caved to Beijing\u2019s demands and sold out the underground faithful in China. The Vatican has said it was the best deal it could get and has been renewed periodically since then.",
      "One of the big foreign policy questions facing Leo, history's first American pope, was whether he would continue renewing the accord or heed conservative demands and make some changes.",
      "There have been apparent violations on the Beijing side with some unilateral appointments that occurred without papal consent. The issue came to a head just before the conclave that elected Leo pope, when the Chinese church proceeded with the preliminary election of two bishops, a step that comes before official consecration.",

    "summary": "Voters went to the polls on Tuesday for New Jersey\u2019s primary elections, which set up the state\u2019s gubernatorial general election this year.",
    "story": [
      "The state's governor, Democrat Phil Murphy, couldn't run again after two terms.",
      "The Associated Press has projected that U.S. Rep. Mikie Sherrill (D-NJ) will win New Jersey's Democratic gubernatorial primary, and that former state assemblyman Jack Ciattarelli will win New Jersey's Republican gubernatorial primary \u2013 setting up a competitive race in November where President Donald Trump's inroads with Garden State voters could be tested.",
      "Republicans are hoping to flip the governorship from blue to red, and point to last year's presidential results as a sign the state has gotten more favorable for Republicans.",
      "\"This year's election for governor is critical for New Jersey's future. You'll decide whether New Jersey is a high tax, high crime, sanctuary state,\" Trump said during a rally for Ciattarelli, whom he endorsed, held by telephone in early June. \"New Jersey is ready to pop out of that blue horror show.\"",
      "Democratic candidate Vice President Kamala Harris won New Jersey by just around 6 percentage points in 2024, but then-Vice President Joe Biden won the state by about 16 percentage points in 2020. That means Rep. Mikie Sherrill will have to campaign in a state that may be redder than it used to be.",
      "\"We built a nation, and people say the scars we have are ugly... The president comes here nonstop to his golf course and calls our state a horror show \u2013 but come November, we're sending a shot across the bow,\" Sherrill told supporters on Tuesday night.",
      "The general election could also be a test of the strength of a Trump endorsement without Trump at the top of the ballot. Jack Ciattarelli likely benefited from Trump's endorsement in the primary, but without Trump on the ticket in November, he will have to convince Trump's base in New Jersey to still turn out.",
      "\"We won because our campaign is about people, not politics... We won because we talked about the issues that matter, the critical issues facing our state and my plan for a safer, more prosperous, and affordable New Jersey,\" Ciattarelli told supporters at a Tuesday election night event.",
      "The other Democratic candidates Sherrill faced were Rep. Josh Gottheimer, who represents the state's 5th District; Newark Mayor Ras Baraka; Jersey City Mayor Steve Fulop; New Jersey Education Association President Sean Spiller; and former state Senate president Steve Sweeney.",
      "Ciattarelli faced conservative radio personality Bill Spadea, state Sen. Jon Bramnick, former Englewood Cliffs Mayor Mario Kranjac, and contractor Justin Barbera.",
      "The contest was on track to become the priciest election in New Jersey history, with over $85 million spent on advertising as of last Wednesday, according to a report from media tracking agency AdImpact.",
      "Among Democrats, Gottheimer has the most ad spending supporting him ($22.8 million), followed by Fulop ($17.8 million).",
      "Ciattarelli led among Republicans with $5.9 million in ad spending or reservations supporting him, dwarfing Spadea's $2.2 million and Bramnick's $1.2 million.",

I say, yeah we do. We do want to show off a little bit.\"",
      "Last month, Army spokesman Steve Warren told reporters that the service welcomes peaceful protests, noting its motto is \"this we'll defend,\" a reference to the service's commitment to upholding democratic values.

Gavin Newsom, adding that the California governor should be \"tarred and feathered.\"",
      "Johnson said Trump is \"fully in his authority right now to do what he is doing\" to \"maintain order\" -- including deploying 4,000 National Guardsmen and 700 Marines to Los Angeles as demonstrators clash with law enforcement amid the protests.",

      "Johnson accused Newsom of focusing more on rebranding himself than protecting the state and its citizens.",
      "\"Do your job, man. That's what I tell Gavin Newsom, do your job,\" Johnson added. \"Stop working on your rebranding and be a governor. Stand up for the rule of law. And he's not doing that.\"",
      "Newsom has called the deployments by Trump \"a blatant abuse of power\" and sued the administration over the move.",
      "Johnson took the opportunity to plug the House-passed tax and immigration bill, which the Senate is negotiating. The immigration woes at the center of the Los Angeles protests can be remedied by the \"One Big Beautiful Bill Act\" that supports Trump's legislative agenda, Johnson said. He called on Democrats to end the \"chaos\" and \"nonsense\" and support the bill.",
      "The legislation boosts spending for the military and border security as well as extends the Trump 2017 tax cuts -- while making some cuts to Medicaid, SNAP and other assistance programs. It could also add $3 trillion to the deficit over the next decade, according to an analysis from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.",
      "Later Tuesday, Johnson said the violence in Los Angeles is not comparable to the Jan. 6 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol, and said Trump's mass pardons of Jan. 6 rioters were not hypocritical.",
      "\"Everybody wants me to relitigate Jan. 6. I'm not going to do that. There's a very clear distinction between the two. The people who broke the law and destroyed property [were] met with the proper consequences on [Jan. 6],\" Johnson said, adding that he is \"trying to be intellectually consistent about this.\"",
      "Other congressional Republicans appear to be in lockstep behind Trump and his decision to deploy National Guard and Marines to Los Angeles.",

      "Republican Sen. Kevin Cramer said that he supported Trump's decision to deploy the Marines, saying he hopes their presence \"deters\" people from violence and brings \"peace.\"",
      "\"Hopefully their presence will be a deterrent to violence. Obviously, there's a right to assemble, and there's a right to peacefully protest -- and then there's what they're doing. So clearly, the state needs help, and the president's sending help, hopefully, hopefully it'll bring some peace,\" Cramer said.",
      "Cramer said that Trump, as the president and therefore the authority on federal immigration policy, has a \"responsibility\" to act in response to the protests.",
      "\"The president has a responsibility to the United States, and he has a federal nexus with regard to immigration policy, and he's exercising it, and I think he's exercising exactly what he said he'd do and what people elected him to do,\" Cramer said.",

      "\"I think he didn't have a choice,\" Kennedy told ABC News of Trump's move to deploy the National Guard and Marines.",
      "\"I think he needs to follow the law, but I think he needs to send in federal troops because it's clear to me the governor and the mayor were going to do nothing. Zero, zilch, nada. He might have met with the rioters and offered them a cup of hot cocoa and a hug and some enthusiastic encouragement, but in terms of containing the riots, they weren't going to do anything.\"",

      "The Trump administration complied with a court order to facilitate the return of Kilmar Abrego Garcia after he was mistakenly deported to his native El Salvador, attorneys for the Department of Justice argued in a court filing on Tuesday.",
      "The filing came in the federal case in Maryland in which U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis had ordered the government to facilitate his return to the United States.",
      "Abrego Garcia was brought back to the U.S. on Friday to face criminal charges in Tennessee, following a series of court battles in which the Trump administration repeatedly said it was unable to bring him back.",
      "In a court filing on Sunday, lawyers for Abrego Garcia argued that, despite his return, the Maryland court case is not over because the court continues to have a role \"to ensure that [Abrego Garcia's] case is handled as it would have been had he not been improperly sent to El Salvador\" -- and that the government must be \"held accountable\" for \"its blatant, willful, and persistent violations of court orders at excruciating cost to Abrego Garcia and his family.\"",
      "In Tuesday's court filing, Justice Department attorneys said that \"Defendants have done exactly what Plaintiffs asked for and what this Court ordered them to do: Plaintiff Abrego Garcia has been returned to the United States.\"",
      "The government \"made diligent efforts to pull down domestic barriers preventing Abrego Garcia from entering\" the U.S. and engaged in diplomatic discussions with the Salvadoran government to bring him back, Justice Department attorneys said in their request for a stay of all case deadlines.",
      "The DOJ said it intends to file a motion to dismiss the case by next week.",
      "Calling Abrego Garcia's attorneys' request to continue the case \"desperate and disappointing,\" the filing said, \"In the face of Abrego Garcia's return to the United States, they baselessly accuse Defendants of 'foot-dragging' and 'intentionally disregard[ing] this Court's and the Supreme Court's orders.'\"",

    "story": [
      "Pentagon budget official estimated LA troop deployment to cost $134 million.",
      "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth told lawmakers Tuesday that he and President Donald Trump have the power to send National Guard and active-duty troops anywhere in the country to ensure Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents can enforce the law, an assertion that -- if carried out -- would open the door to a historic clash between Trump and Democratic governors.",
      "\"We believe that ICE, which is a federal law enforcement agency, has the right to safely conduct operations in any state, in any jurisdiction in the country,\" Hegseth told the House Appropriations Defense subcommittee.",
      "\"ICE ought be able to do its job, whether it's Minneapolis or Los Angeles,\" he added.",
      "Hegseth's testimony before a House panel came as some 4,800 National Guard and Marines were en route to Los Angeles for a 60-day deployment after protestors clashed with law enforcement, setting cars on fire and spraying graffiti on buildings.",
      "President Donald Trump also opened the door for possible military deployments elsewhere, telling reporters on Tuesday that if protests break out in other states \"they will be met with equal or greater force.\"",
      "The move to call in U.S. troops, including 700 Marines, ignored objections by state authorities and was sharply criticized by Democratic lawmakers and California Gov. Gavin Newsom, who called the deployment inflammatory and warned it would only escalate tensions.",
      "At Tuesday's hearing, Rep. Betty McCollum of Minnesota, the top Democrat on the House subcommittee, called the decision \"premature\" and \"downright escalatory.\" She said Marines aren't suited for a domestic mission in which they could be asked to use their combat training and firepower, typically reserved for foreign adversaries, on Americans.",
      "\"Active-duty military has absolutely no role in domestic law enforcement, and they are not trained for those missions. I ask you, Mister secretary, and I ask the president, follow the law,\" she said.",
      "The Pentagon's top acting budget official, Bryn Woollacott MacDonnell, estimated the deployment would cost $134 million and said the money would be pulled from existing operations and maintenance accounts.",
      "The Trump administration said the troops are being used under a legal authority known as Title 10 of the U.S. Code, which allows the president to deploy military forces to protect federal buildings and personnel in cases of \"a rebellion or danger of rebellion against the authority of the Government of the United States\" or when \"the President is unable with the regular forces to execute the laws of the United States.\"",
      "U.S. officials said the \"rules for force\" for such an engagement would restrict troops from patrolling U.S. streets or helping law enforcement arrest protestors. Troops would carry guns and ammunition separately for use only in self-defense and to protect federal property.",
      "But experts say the rules of protecting federal buildings and personnel could get murky if service members are asked to protect ICE personnel during an immigration raid or if protestors attack buildings.",
      "Rachel VanLandingham, a professor at Southwestern Law School in Los Angeles and former chief legal advisor to U.S. Central Command, said she is skeptical that Marines who are trained to fight and win foreign wars are sufficiently trained to police Americans.",

    "story": [
      "Organizers say interest is growing since the crackdown on protesters in L.A.",
      "Progressive groups say they'll hold more than 1,500 \u201cNo Kings Day\u201d events across the U.S. on Saturday to protest the Trump administration and to counter the military parade in Washington, D.C., marking the U.S. Army\u2019s 250th birthday.",
      "The original plan from major progressive organizing group Indivisible and others to counter the military parade with protests was first announced in early May. But Indivisible Co-Executive Director Ezra Levin told MSNBC on Monday night that President Donald Trump\u2019s response to protests against Immigration and Customs Enforcement in Los Angeles has brought many more people to the No Kings website, and that the group has scheduled more trainings this week in response to the \u201coverwhelming interest.\u201d",
      "In its May news release announcing the events, Indivisible said that the parade is meant to be a \"made-for-TV display of dominance for [Trump's] birthday\" and that the president is using the military's birthday to celebrate his own, which also falls on June 14.",
      "Last month, when asked about reports of the military parade by NBC News, Trump said the parade plans were \u201cnot for my birthday\u201d but are for Flag Day and to celebrate the military. The Pentagon and Army have said they are planning their own birthday celebration and not planning to sing \u201chappy birthday\u201d to the president.",
      "Indivisible has also called out what it says is overreach by the White House against courts and slammed deportations and administration actions it said have hurt civil rights and decimated services people need.",
      "\u201cThis country doesn\u2019t belong to a king -- and we\u2019re not letting him throw himself a parade funded by tens of millions of our taxpayer dollars while stealing from us and stripping away our rights, our freedoms, and the programs our families rely on,\u201d Indivisible said in a statement last month. \u201cOn June 14th, we\u2019re coming together to send one clear message: No Thrones. No Crowns. No Kings.\u201d",
      "In a press release on Friday, Indivisible said in addition to locations across the country, there are events planned in Europe and South America.",
      "\u201cDonald Trump and his regime are cracking down on media, on business, on higher education, and on civil society more broadly -- anyone who opposes them,\" Indivisible co-executive director Leah Greenberg said in a statement Friday. \"That is the context in which Donald Trump rolled out his plans for his birthday parade ... He wants people to think that his power is inevitable, that its consolidation is a given. What we want is to show that it\u2019s just as likely -- more likely, even -- that this is going to be a short-lived era.\u201d",
      "In a \u201ctoolkit\u201d document for organizers posted on their website, Indivisible and the coalition of more than 200 groups overseeing the events gave instructions for how people can assemble and register their own protests, but asked that organizers not schedule any events in Washington, D.C., in order to make other places the \u201ccenter of gravity,\u201d and because the coalition wants to draw a contrast with Trump.",
      "The document also asks participants to keep the protests nonviolent and to de-escalate any confrontations between protesters and others, and say weapons should not be brought to the events.",
      "Indivisible was also among the groups organizing the widely attended national \u201cHands Off\u201d protests in April.",
      "Organizers of the protests are cognizant of the \u201cNo Kings\u201d protests coming amid the White House\u2019s crackdown on protests in Los Angeles, but they express confidence in running their events successfully and say they\u2019ve gotten even more interest now.",
      "\u201cWe do not want to give Trump an excuse to crack down on peaceful protests, which is exactly what he wants to do. We don't want to give him some sort of narrative excuse to say protesters are protesting the military \u2026 This is a democracy. And in a democracy, power depends on the people. It flows from the people. It depends on the consent of the governed, and on Saturday we're going to show up to make that point very clear,\u201d Levin told MSNBC.",

      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 President Donald Trump likes to say he's bringing in trillions of dollars in investments from foreign countries, but a provision in his tax cuts bill could cause international companies to avoid expanding into the United States.",
      "The House-passed version of the legislation would allow the federal government to impose taxes on foreign-parented companies and investors from countries judged as charging \u201cunfair foreign taxes\u201d on U.S. companies.",
      "Known as Section 899, the measure could cause companies to avoid investing in the the U.S. out of concern they could face steep taxes. The fate of the measure rests with the Senate \u2014 setting off a debate about its prospects and impact.",
      "A new analysis by the Global Business Alliance, a trade group representing international companies such as Toyota and Nestl\u00e9, estimates that the provision would cost the U.S. 360,000 jobs and $55 billion annually over 10 years in lost gross domestic product. The analysis estimates that the tax could cut a third off the economic growth anticipated from the overall tax cuts by Congress' Joint Committee on Taxation.",
      "\"While proponents say this punitive tax hike is intended as a retaliatory measure against foreign governments, this report confirms that the real victims are American workers in states like North Carolina, South Carolina, Indiana, Tennessee and Texas,\" said Jonathan Samford, president and CEO of the Global Business Alliance.",
      "Republican Rep. Jason Smith of Missouri, chair of the House Ways and Means Committee, has defended the provision as protecting U.S. interests by giving the president a tool that can be used against countries with tax codes that, in the federal government's opinion, put American companies at a disadvantage.",
      "\u201cIf these countries withdraw these taxes and decide to behave, we will have achieved our goal,\" Smith said in a statement last week. \"It\u2019s just common sense. I urge my colleagues in the Senate to move quickly to pass this bill and protect Americans from economic bad actors around the world.\u201d",
      "The tax gets at a fundamental tension within Trump's policy agenda: a contradiction in the broad strokes of Trump simultaneously trying to tax imports and foreign profits at higher rates while also seeking investments from companies headquartered abroad.",
      "In late May, Trump defended his approach by saying that his tariffs were causing more countries to invest in the U.S. to avoid imports getting taxed. While some countries and companies have made announcements, there is not evidence of the investments pushing up spending on new factories as measured in the government's monthly report on construction spending.",
      "The Republican president said his tendency to impose steep tariffs, then retreat to lower rates, had succeeded.",
      "\u201cWe have $14 trillion now invested, committed to investing,\u201d Trump said then. \u201cYou know we have the hottest country anywhere in the world. I went to Saudi Arabia, the king told me, he said, you got the hottest -- we have the hottest country in the world right now.\u201d",
      "The Global Business Alliance was among the groups that signed a letter on Monday warning of the consequences of Section 899 to Senate Majority Leader John Thune of South Dakota and Senate Finance Committee Chairman Mike Crapo of Idaho, both Republicans.",

      "The analysis performed by EY Quantitative Economics and Statistics notes there is a degree of uncertainty in how the taxes under Section 899 could be implemented. But they could be charged against companies based in countries that tax digital services, as is the case in parts of Europe.",
      "If the U.S. judged the taxes unfair, there would be a 30% tax rate on foreign companies' profits and income. People working in the U.S. for the companies who are not citizens could also be taxed, among other provisions.",
      "The possibility of the taxes and seemingly arbitrary nature by which they could be imposed is also a challenge, said Chye-Ching Huang, executive director of New York University's Tax Law Center.",

      "A federal grand jury returned a three-count indictment on Tuesday.",
      "A federal grand jury has returned an indictment charging New Jersey Rep. LaMonica McIver for allegedly assaulting law enforcement officers outside of an immigration detention facility last month, officials announced Tuesday.",
      "The three-count indictment charges the Democratic congresswoman with \"forcibly impeding and interfering with federal law enforcement officers\" at the facility, New Jersey U.S. Attorney Alina Habba said in a post on X.",
      "\"As I have stated in the past, it is my Constitutional obligation as the Chief Federal Law Enforcement Officer for New Jersey to ensure that our federal partners are protected when executing their duties,\" Habba said. \"While people are free to express their views for or against particular policies, they must not do so in a manner that endangers law enforcement and the communities those officers serve.\"",
      "The indictment is a standard procedural step after Habba's office charged McIver via a criminal complaint last month.",
      "McIver has vowed she will fight the charges and plans to plead not guilty.",
      "\"The facts of this case will prove I was simply doing my job and will expose these proceedings for what they are: a brazen attempt at political intimidation,\" she said in a statement on X. \"This indictment is no more justified than the original charges, and is an effort by Trump's administration to dodge accountability for the chaos ICE caused and scare me out of doing the work I was elected to do. But it won't work -- I will not be intimidated.\"",
      "On May 9, McIver and a few other members of Congress were at Delaney Hall, a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention facility in Newark, New Jersey, to conduct oversight.",
      "Tensions escalated when a federal officer ordered Newark Mayor Ras Baraka to leave a secured area of the facility or face arrest, and pushing and shoving allegedly occurred, according to prosecutors.",
      "\"During her continued attempts to thwart the arrest, McIver slammed her forearm into the body of one law enforcement officer and also reached out and tried to restrain that officer by forcibly grabbing him,\" the Department of Justice said in a press release on Tuesday. \"McIver also used each of her forearms to forcibly strike a second officer.\"",
      "Following the charges via criminal complaint, McIver alleged in a statement that the decision was politically motivated.",
      "\"The charges against me are purely political -- they mischaracterize and distort my actions, and are meant to criminalize and deter legislative oversight,\" McIver said.",
      "Top House Democrats also released a joint statement last month defending McIver, vowing to \"vigorously\" respond to what they say is an illegitimate abuse of power.",
      "\"An attack on one of us is an attack on the American people. House Democrats will respond vigorously in the days to come at a time, place and manner of our choosing,\" the leaders said.",
      "If convicted, the maximum penalty for the charges in the indictment ranges from one to eight years, Habba said.",
      "Baraka was arrested at the facility and charged with trespassing, though Habba later dropped the charge.",

      "After a bruising war between Israel and Hezbollah, Lebanon\u2019s new leaders sense an opportunity to revitalize the country\u2019s devastated economy with help from its wealthy Gulf neighbors",
      "BEIRUT -- Fireworks lit up the night sky over Beirut\u2019s famous St. Georges Hotel as hit songs from the 1960s and 70s filled the air in a courtyard overlooking the Mediterranean Sea.",
      "The retro-themed event was hosted last month by Lebanon\u2019s Tourism Ministry to promote the upcoming summer season and perhaps recapture some of the good vibes from an era viewed as a golden one for the country. In the years before a civil war began in 1975, Lebanon was the go-to destination for wealthy tourists from neighboring Gulf countries seeking beaches in summer, snow-capped mountains in winter and urban nightlife year-round.",
      "In the decade after the war, tourists from Gulf countries \u2013 and crucially, Saudi Arabia \u2013 came back, and so did Lebanon\u2019s economy. But by the early 2000s, as the Iran-backed militant group Hezbollah gained power, Lebanon's relations with Gulf countries began to sour. Tourism gradually dried up, starving its economy of billions of dollars in annual spending.",
      "Now, after last year's bruising war with Israel, Hezbollah is much weaker and Lebanon's new political leaders sense an opportunity to revitalize the economy once again with help from wealthy neighbors. They aim to disarm Hezbollah and rekindle ties with Saudi Arabia and other Gulf countries, which in recent years have prohibited their citizens from visiting Lebanon or importing its products.",
      "\u201cTourism is a big catalyst, and so it\u2019s very important that the bans get lifted,\u201d said Laura Khazen Lahoud, the country's tourism minister.",
      "On the highway leading to the Beirut airport, once-ubiquitous banners touting Hezbollah\u2019s leadership have been replaced with commercial billboards and posters that read \u201ca new era for Lebanon.\u201d In the center of Beirut, and especially in neighborhoods that hope to attract tourists, political posters are coming down, and police and army patrols are on the rise.",
      "There are signs of thawing relations with some Gulf neighbors. The United Arab Emirates and Kuwait have lifted yearslong travel bans.",
      "All eyes are now on Saudi Arabia, a regional political and economic powerhouse, to see if it will follow suit, according to Lahoud and other Lebanese officials. A key sticking point is security, these officials say. Although a ceasefire with Israel has been in place since November, near-daily airstrikes have continued in southern and eastern Lebanon, where Hezbollah over the years had built its political base and powerful military arsenal.",
      "As vital as tourism is \u2014 it accounted for almost 20% of Lebanon's economy before it tanked in 2019 \u2014 the country's leaders say it is just one piece of a larger puzzle they are trying to put back together.",
      "Lebanon\u2019s agricultural and industrial sectors are in shambles, suffering a major blow in 2021, when Saudi Arabia banned their exports after accusing Hezbollah of smuggling drugs into Riyadh. Years of economic dysfunction have left the country's once-thriving middle class in a state of desperation.",
      "The World Bank says poverty nearly tripled in Lebanon over the past decade, affecting close to half its population of nearly 6 million. To make matters worse, inflation is soaring, with the Lebanese pound losing 90% of its value, and many families lost their savings when banks collapsed.",
      "Tourism is seen by Lebanon's leaders as the best way to kickstart the reconciliation needed with Gulf countries -- and only then can they move on to exports and other economic growth opportunities.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the thing that makes most sense, because that\u2019s all Lebanon can sell now,\u201d said Sami Zoughaib, research manager at The Policy Initiative, a Beirut-based think tank.",
      "With summer still weeks away, flights to Lebanon are already packed with expats and locals from countries that overturned their travel bans, and hotels say bookings have been brisk.",
      "At the event hosted last month by the tourism ministry, the owner of the St. Georges Hotel, Fady El-Khoury, beamed. The hotel, owned by his father in its heyday, has acutely felt Lebanon's ups and downs over the decades, closing and reopening multiple times because of wars. \u201cI have a feeling that the country is coming back after 50 years,\u201d he said.",
      "On a recent weekend, as people crammed the beaches of the northern city of Batroun, and jet skis whizzed along the Mediterranean, local business people sounded optimistic that the country was on the right path.",
      "\u201cWe are happy, and everyone here is happy,\u201d said Jad Nasr, co-owner of a private beach club. \u201cAfter years of being boycotted by the Arabs and our brothers in the Gulf, we expect this year for us to always be full.\u201d",
      "Still, tourism is not a panacea for Lebanon's economy, which for decades has suffered from rampant corruption and waste.",
      "Lebanon has been in talks with the International Monetary Fund for years over a recovery plan that would include billions in loans and require the country to combat corruption, restructure its banks, and bring improvements to a range of public services, including electricity and water.",
      "Without those and other reforms, Lebanon's wealthy neighbors will lack confidence to invest there, experts said. A tourism boom alone would serve as a \u201cmorphine shot that would only temporarily ease the pain\" rather than stop the deepening poverty in Lebanon, Zoughaib said.",
      "The tourism minister, Lahoud, agreed, saying a long-term process has only just begun.",
      "\"But we\u2019re talking about subjects we never talked about before,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I think the whole country has realized that war doesn\u2019t serve anyone, and that we really need our economy to be back and flourish again.\u201d",

      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump is looking to cancel $9.4 billion in spending already approved by Congress. That's just a sliver of the $1.7 trillion that lawmakers OK'd for the budget year ending Sept. 30.",
      "The package of 21 budget rescissions will have to be approved by both chambers of Congress for the cuts to take place, beginning with a House vote expected Thursday. Otherwise, the spending remains in place.",
      "The White House is betting that cutting federal investments in public media and some foreign aid programs will prove politically popular. Republicans say if this first effort is successful, they hope more rescission packages will follow as they look to continue work by the so-called Department of Government Efficiency once run by billionaire Elon Musk.",
      "Democrats describe the cuts as inhumane and say they would rip life-saving support from hungry and sick people across the globe. Republicans are describing the cuts as \u201cmodest\u201d and say the U.S. will continue to play a critical role in helping the world's most vulnerable people.",
      "Here's a look at some of the spending the White House is trying to claw back:",
      "The Republican president has asked lawmakers to rescind nearly $1.1 billion from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which represents the full amount it's slated to receive during the next two budget years. Congress has traditionally provided public media with advanced funds to reduce political pressures.",
      "The corporation distributes the money mostly to public television and radio stations around the country, with some assigned to National Public Radio and the Public Broadcasting System to support national programming.",
      "The White House says the public media system is politically biased and an unnecessary expense.",
      "Much of the conservatives' ire is focused on NPR and PBS. \u201cWe believe that you all can hate us on your own dime,\u201d said Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, during a hearing in March.",
      "But about two-thirds of the money goes to more than 1,500 locally owned public radio and television stations. Nearly half of those stations serve rural areas of the country.",
      "\u201cThey want to punish the national guys, that's fine,\u201d said Rep. Mark Amodei, a Republican who said he was undecided going into this week's vote. \u201cBut I'm trying to get a handle on what it means for my stations in Nevada, because the ability to fundraise at the national level ain't the same as the ability to fundraise in Reno.\u201d",
      "The association representing local public television stations warns that many of them would be forced to close if the GOP bill passes. Those stations provide emergency alerts, free educational programming and high school sports coverage and highlight hometown heroes.",
      "Meanwhile, local radio stations say their share of the allocation provides funding for 386 stations employing nearly 10,000 people. Dozens of stations rely on the public grants for more than half of their budget. Many others for nearly half.",
      "Some Republicans say they worry about what the cuts would mean for local public stations but tough decisions are necessary.",
      "Rep. Dusty Johnson, R-S.D., said South Dakota Public Broadcasting does a \u201creally good job of covering the state Legislature\" and other public affairs.",
      "\u201cSo these rescissions are not going to be comfortable for South Dakota to deal with,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cThat being said, we're $37 trillion in debt.\"",
      "Trump's administration is looking to claw back about $900 million from $10 billion that Congress has approved for global health programs.",
      "That includes canceling $500 million for activities related to infectious diseases and child and maternal health and another $400 million to address the global HIV epidemic.",
      "The administration says the $500 million rescission for infectious diseases would not reduce treatment but would \u201celiminate programs that are antithetical to American interests and worsen the lives of women and children, like \u2018family planning\u2019 and \u2018reproductive health,\u2019 LGBTQI+ activities, and equity programs.\u201d It makes a similar assurance on the HIV funding, saying it would eliminate \u201conly those programs that neither provide life-saving treatment nor support American interests.\u201d",
      "Scores of humanitarian aid groups have asked lawmakers to oppose the proposed cuts. Catholic Relief Services called on donors to contact their members of Congress to urge them to vote against the bill. Without the U.S. assistance, \"countless lives are at risk, and the needs will continue to rise,\u201d said the plea to supporters.",
      "The importance of the United States' contribution to the global\u202fHIV\u202fresponse cannot be overstated, according to the Joint United Nations Program on HIV/AIDS. It says the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, or PEPFAR, has saved more than 26 million lives and averted almost 5 million new HIV infections since it was launched in 2003 under President George W. Bush, a Republican.",
      "\u201cInstead of facing a death sentence, people supported by PEPFAR are raising families, building their communities, and helping their communities grow and develop,\u201d said Rep. Rosa DeLauro, D-Conn.",
      "The Trump administration is looking to cancel $800 million, or a quarter of the amount Congress approved, for a program that provides emergency shelter, water and sanitation, and family reunification for those forced to flee their own country. The program also helps vetted refugees who come to the U.S. get started in their new country.",
      "The White House says \u201cthese funds support activities that could be more fairly shared with non-U.S. Government donors, providing savings to the U.S. taxpayer.\u201d",
      "Refugees International urged Congress to reject what it described as a reckless proposal.",
      "About 45% of the savings sought by the White House would come from two programs designed to boost the economies, democratic institutions and civil societies in developing countries.",
      "The administration wants to claw back $2.5 billion of the $3.9 billion approved for the Development Assistance program at the U.S. Agency for International Development and about $1.7 billion, or nearly half of the funds, dedicated to the State Department's Economic Support Fund.",
      "The administration says in its request to Congress that the Development Assistance account is supposed to fund programs that work to end extreme poverty and promote resilient democratic societies, but in practice many of the programs \u201cconflict with American values\u201d and bankroll corrupt leaders' evasion of responsibilities to their citizens while providing \"no clear benefit to Americans.\u201d",

      "NORFOLK, Va. -- James McDonough served in the U.S. Army for 27 years, fighting in Vietnam and delivering humanitarian aid to Rwanda. For him, Saturday\u2019s military parade in Washington for the Army\u2019s 250th anniversary \u2014 coinciding with President Donald Trump's birthday \u2014 is about the resilience of a vital institution and the nation it serves.",
      "\u201cThe soldiers marching that day represent all of that history,\u201d said McDonough, 78, of Crofton, Maryland. \u201cThey don\u2019t represent a single day. They don\u2019t represent a single person. It\u2019s the American Army still standing straight, walking tall, ready to defend our country.\u201d",
      "Christopher Purdy, an Army veteran who served in Iraq, called the parade a facade that paints over some of the Republican president\u2019s policies that have targeted military veterans and current service members, including cuts at the Department of Veterans Affairs and a ban on transgender troops.",
      "Purdy said the parade, long sought by Trump, will needlessly display U.S. military might on the president\u2019s 79th birthday.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s embarrassing,\u201d said Purdy, 40, of Atlanta. \u201cIt\u2019s expensive. And whatever his reasons are for doing it, I think it\u2019s entirely unnecessary.\u201d",
      "Until recently, the Army\u2019s long-planned birthday celebration did not include a big parade. Added under the Trump administration, the event, featuring hundreds of military vehicles and aircraft and thousands of soldiers, has divided veterans.",
      "Some liken it to the military chest-pounding commonly seen in North Korea, a step toward authoritarianism or a perverse birthday party for Trump.",
      "Others see it as a once-in-a-lifetime accounting of the Army's achievements and the military service of millions of soldiers over centuries. The parade is not about Trump, they say, but the public seeing the faces of soldiers when so few Americans serve.",
      "The Army expects up to 200,000 people could attend and says the parade will cost an estimated $25 million to $45 million.",
      "Trump, speaking at Fort Bragg this week, said Saturday would be \u201ca big day\" and noted \"we want to show off a little bit.\"",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re going to celebrate our greatness and our achievements,\" he said. \"This week, we honor 250 years of valor and glory and triumph by the greatest fighting force ever to walk the face of the Earth: the United States Army.\u201d",
      "For Edmundo Eugenio Martinez Jr., an Army veteran who fought in Iraq, the parade is a missed opportunity to honor generations of veterans, many of whom paid a steep price and came home to little fanfare.",
      "\u201cSadly, the timing and the optics and divisive politics have ruined it,\u201d said Martinez, 48, of Katy, Texas. \u201cAnd I\u2019m not picking one side or the other. Both sides are guilty.\u201d",
      "Joe Plenzler, a retired Marine who fought in Iraq, said Trump wants to see troops saluting him on his birthday as tanks roll past.",
      "\u201cIt's just suspicious,\" the 53-year-old from Middletown, Virginia, said of the timing.",
      "\u201cI absolutely love the Army from the bottom of my cold black Marine heart,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if the Army\u2019s birthday was a day later, we probably wouldn't be doing it. I\u2019d rather see that $50 million take care of the men and women who went off to war and came back with missing arms, legs and eyeballs, and with damaged brains.\u201d",
      "Joe Kmiech, who served in the Army and Minnesota National Guard from 1989 to 1998, supports the parade because the Army is \"part of American culture and our fabric.\u201d",
      "He notes the Army's pioneering contributions to engineering and medicine, from dams to new surgical techniques. Like many veterans, he has a strong familial connection: His father served in the Army, and so did his maternal grandfather, who fought in World War II.",
      "\u201cI didn't vote for President Trump, but the commander in chief is going to be part of that celebration,\u201d said Kmiech, 54, of Roberts, Wisconsin. \u201cThe distinction needs to be made that the parade is a celebration of our Army, not of a person.\u201d",
      "For Gulf War Army veteran Paul Sullivan, Trump and the parade are inextricably linked.",
      "\u201cThis Trump tank travesty is all about stroking Trump\u2019s ego,\u201d said Sullivan, 62, who lives outside Charlottesville, Virginia. \u201cIf Trump truly cared about our service members, he would sit down with them quietly and say, \u2018What can we do with $50 million or $100 million to make your lives better?\u2019 He\u2019s not.\u201d",
      "McDonough, the veteran from Crofton, Maryland, disagrees that the parade is about Trump or too costly. He said the U.S. held a grand celebration in New York after World War II when the nation was deeply in debt.",
      "\u201cWe certainly need to bring our debt down, and we certainly need to take care of our veterans,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it\u2019s a false dichotomy. It\u2019s like saying if we bought two less aircraft carriers, we could do so much better to take care of our poor.\u201d",
      "And McDonough said soldiers' oath is to the Constitution, not to Trump.",
      "The president \u201cunderstands the importance of doing this, not only for the Army, but for the nation,\u201d McDonough said.",
      "Purdy, the veteran from Atlanta, said the parade's brazen flex of military strength is not an American tradition, particularly absent a recent victory.",
      "\u201cI'm not saying we shouldn't celebrate the country,\" he said. \u201cBut for us to be projecting this type of hard power, in such a real in-your-face way, that\u2019s just not who we are.\u201d",
      "Trump is brushing aside old alliances and foreign aid that have helped maintain peace for decades, Purdy asserted.",
      "\u201cIt signals a real dark turn if we\u2019re just going to roll out the tanks,\" Purdy said.",
      "Michael Nardotti, an Army veteran who served in Vietnam, said military hardware has long been in American parades, which can help recruitment.",
      "More important, he said, is the tremendous value in the public seeing soldiers' faces in a parade when active-duty troops make up less than 1% of the population.",
      "\u201c'People are the Army,'\u201d said Nardotti, 78, of Aldie, Virginia, quoting a former Army chief of staff.",
      "Nardotti said he'll listen carefully to Trump's speech.",
      "\u201cI hope it sends the right message,\u201d he said.",

      "President Donald Trump is taking his seat in the president's box for opening night of the award-winning musical \u201cLes Mis\u00e9rables\u201d at the Kennedy Center",
      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump is set to take a seat at Wednesday's opening night of the award-winning musical \u201cLes Mis\u00e9rables\" at the Kennedy Center, where he replaced the previous leadership with loyalists, had himself installed as chairman and pledged to rid the performing arts venue of programming he has complained is \u201cwoke\u201d and too focused on leftist ideology and political correctness.",
      "The Republican president's attendance at the sold-out showing of the Tony Award-winning tale of redemption in 19th century France comes as he has focused more than any recent predecessor on the arts center along the Potomac River that is a memorial to a slain Democratic president.",
      "Presidents' involvement in the Kennedy Center's affairs had been limited to naming members to the board of trustees and attending the taping of its annual honors program in the fall.",
      "But after returning to office in January, Trump stunned the arts world by firing the Kennedy Center's longtime director and board and replacing them with loyalists, who then named him as chairman, and promising to overhaul its programming, management and even appearance as part of an effort to put his stamp on the national arts scene.",
      "Trump's appearance in the Opera House on Wednesday, accompanied by first lady Melania Trump, will also mark his first time at a Kennedy Center performance as president. He avoided the venue after entertainment industry pushback to his policies in his first term in office, breaking with presidential tradition by never attending the annual Kennedy Center Honors taping.",
      "His moves have upset some of the center's patrons and performers.",
      "In March, the audience booed Vice President JD Vance and his wife, Usha, after they slipped into upper-level seats in the Concert Hall to hear the National Symphony Orchestra. Trump appointed Usha Vance to the Kennedy Center board along with White House chief of staff Susie Wiles, Attorney General Pam Bondi and Fox News Channel hosts Maria Bartiromo and Laura Ingraham, among other supporters.",
      "Sales of subscription packages are said to have declined since Trump's takeover, and several touring productions, including \u201cHamilton,\u201d have canceled planned runs at the center. Artists such as actor Issa Rae and musician Rhiannon Giddens scrapped scheduled appearances, and Kennedy Center consultants including musician Ben Folds and singer Ren\u00e9e Fleming have resigned.",
      "Understudies may perform Wednesday night due to boycotts by \u201cLes Mis\u00e9rables\u201d cast members.",
      "Since returning to the White House in January, Trump has adopted a more aggressive posture toward the arts. The White House has taken steps to cancel millions of dollars in previously awarded federal humanities grants to arts and culture groups, and Trump\u2019s budget blueprint proposed eliminating the National Endowment for the Arts and the National Endowment for the Humanities.",
      "Trump has also targeted Smithsonian museums by signing executive orders to restrict their funding and by attempting to fire the director of the National Portrait Gallery.",
      "Trump hosted the board at the White House for dinner in May and said congressional Republicans have pushed for more than $250 million for repairs and maintenance at the Kennedy Center. He claimed that \u201ctremendous amounts of money\u201d had been spent at the center but \u201cthey certainly didn't spend it on wallpaper, carpet or painting.\u201d",
      "He characterized previous programming as \u201cout of control with rampant political propaganda\u201d and said it featured \u201csome very inappropriate shows,\u201d including a \u201cMarxist anti-police performance\u201d and \u201cLesbian-only Shakespeare.\u201d",
      "Trump cited some drag show performances as a reason to take control of the center, though next season's theater lineup includes \u201dMrs. Doubtfire,\" which tells the story of a divorced man who disguises himself as a female nanny so he can spend time with his children.",
      "Trump also visited the Kennedy Center in March to preside over a board meeting and take a tour.",
      "The Kennedy Center, which is supported by government money and private donations, opened in 1971 and for decades has been seen as an apolitical celebration of the arts.",
      "It was first conceived in the late 1950s, during the administration of Republican President Dwight Eisenhower, who backed a bill from the Democratic-led Congress calling for a National Culture Center. In the early 1960s, Democratic President John F. Kennedy launched a fundraising initiative, and his successor, President Lyndon B. Johnson, signed into law a 1964 bill renaming the project the John F. Kennedy Memorial Center for the Performing Arts. Kennedy had been assassinated the year before.",

    "story": [
      "Lawyers for a South Carolina death row inmate are heading to federal court to argue that the state is not properly carrying out executions",
      "Lawyers for a South Carolina death row inmate will be in federal court Wednesday trying to convince a judge that the state is not properly carrying out lethal injections or firing squad executions, an argument meant to spare the prisoner just two days before he's scheduled to die.",
      "Stephen Stanko's attorneys said the two doses of lethal injection drugs used in the past three executions by that method show those subjected to the procedure have died a lingering death, still conscious as they felt like they were drowning when fluid rushed into their lungs.",
      "Stanko changed his mind and decided to die by lethal injection because of accounts about the last firing squad death.",
      "In that April execution, the volunteer shooters nearly missed Mikal Mahdi's heart, meaning the man convicted of killing an off-duty police officer took three to four times as long to die as he was supposed to, Stanko's lawyers said in court papers.",
      "One expert hired by Stanko's attorneys said the evidence suggests the firing squad may have aimed slightly below the target or the target was not placed on Mahdi's heart to \u201ccause great pain before his death,\u201d according to court papers filed last week.",
      "Lawyers for the state vigorously denied the claims. They point out that the South Carolina Supreme Court rejected a similar last-ditch appeal on May 28. They said every execution is different and that lawyers representing incarcerated people have not proven any condemned prisoner suffered gratuitous pain.",
      "\u201cSo (perhaps) it\u2019s not the method that\u2019s the issue \u2014 instead, these inmates just don\u2019t want to have their sentences carried out and are willing to make any argument that they can,\u201d wrote Grayson Lambert, a lawyer for South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster.",
      "Lawyers for the state will ask federal Judge Richard Gergel on Wednesday to dismiss the claims.",
      "Stanko would be the sixth inmate executed in South Carolina in nine months. There were originally four executions scheduled around the country this week, one in South Carolina and one each in Florida and Alabama. On Monday, an Oklahoma judge granted a temporary stay to a man scheduled to be put to death Thursday.",
      "Stanko, 57, is slated to die at 6 p.m. Friday at a Columbia prison for killing his 74-year-old friend, Henry Turner. Stanko went to Turner\u2019s Horry County home in April 2006 after lying about his father dying.",
      "Hours before killing Turner, Stanko beat and strangled his girlfriend in her Georgetown County home and raped her daughter before slashing the teen\u2019s throat. The daughter survived and testified against him at one of his trials. Stanko was also sentenced to death in that case.",
      "Stanko's lawyers, in their 49-page brief, include a number of ways their experts think South Carolina is improperly carrying out executions.",
      "They include using bullets in the firing squad that aren't powerful enough to guarantee the heart will be destroyed, failing to properly oversee how an IV line is placed for lethal injections and improper storage of the powerful sedative pentobarbital, which is used to kill inmates.",
      "The lawyers said the state is using two doses of pentobarbital in executions because \u2014 while inmates might be paralyzed by the drug \u2014 they remain conscious enough to feel like they are drowning and take longer than 10 minutes to die.",
      "Attorneys for the state said witnesses to the executions have not reported any signs of distress and said the inmates appeared to stop breathing within a minute or two.",
      "The most serious accusations in Stanko's lawsuit come from Dr. Jonathan Groner, an expert in lethal injection and other capital punishments and a surgeon who teaches at Ohio State University.",
      "\u201cI am concerned that some element of those responsible for carrying out Mr. Mahdi\u2019s execution intended not to hit his target and to cause great pain before his death,\u201d Groner wrote.",
      "State Correction Department officials deny anything went wrong in Mahdi's execution. Agency leaders have signed sworn statements saying that all three guns fired and no bullets or fragments were found in the death chamber after Mahdi's lawyers suggested one shot missed entirely.",
      "\u201cHow bullets react once they strike the body is something that neither SCDC nor the members of the firing squad can control. That one condemned inmate dies more quickly than another does not necessarily mean that something went awry in one execution,\u201d the state said.",
      "Complicating any investigation into Madhi's death is an inadequate autopsy. It did not include X-rays to allow the results to be independently verified. Only one photo was taken of Mahdi\u2019s body and there were no close-ups of the wounds. The inmate's clothing was not examined to determine where the target was placed or how it aligned with the damage the bullets caused, according to forensic pathologist Terri Haddix of California, one of the defense experts.",
      "Stanko's lawyers want to pause his execution to take a closer look at Mahdi's death and require the three firing squad members to take a sworn oath they will \u201cshoot at the target in good faith.\u201d",

      "LOS ANGELES -- Los Angeles police swiftly enforced a downtown curfew Tuesday night, making arrests moments after it took effect, while deploying officers on horseback and using crowd control projectiles to break up a group of hundreds demonstrating against President Donald Trump\u2019s immigration crackdown.",
      "Members of the National Guard stood watch behind plastic shields, but did not appear to participate in the arrests.",
      "Hours later, many of the protesters had dispersed, although sporadic confrontations continued that were much smaller than in previous nights. Officials said the curfew was necessary to stop vandalism and theft by agitators looking to cause trouble.",
      "Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom earlier accused Trump of drawing a \u201cmilitary dragnet\u201d across the nation\u2019s second-largest city with his escalating use of the National Guard. He also deployed Marines, though none were seen on the streets Tuesday.",
      "Newsom asked a court to put an emergency stop to the military helping federal immigration agents, with some guardsmen now standing in protection around agents as they carried out arrests. He said it would only heighten tensions and promote civil unrest. The judge set a hearing for Thursday, giving the administration several days to continue those activities.",
      "The change moves troops closer to engaging in law enforcement actions like deportations as Trump has promised as part of his administration\u2019s immigration crackdown. The Guard has the authority to temporarily detain people who attack officers but any arrests ultimately would be made by law enforcement.",
      "Trump has activated more than 4,000 National Guard members and 700 Marines over the objections of city and state leaders. They were originally deployed to protect federal buildings.",
      "Demonstrations have spread to other cities nationwide, including Dallas and Austin, Texas, Chicago and New York, where a thousand people rallied and multiple arrests were made.",
      "In Texas, where police in Austin used chemical irritants to disperse several hundred demonstrators Monday, Republican Gov. Greg Abbott\u2019s office said Texas National Guard troops were \u201con standby\" in areas where demonstrations are planned, Abbott spokesperson Andrew Mahaleris said Tuesday evening.",
      "Guard members were deployed to San Antonio, according to assistant police chief Jesse Salame. He said he did not know how many were sent or details on the deployment.",
      "Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass declared a local emergency on the fifth day of protests and said the curfew will run from 8 p.m. Tuesday until 6 a.m. Wednesday. She said it was expected to last for several days.",
      "\u201cWe reached a tipping point\u201d after 23 businesses were looted, Bass said during a news conference Tuesday.",
      "The curfew covers a 1 square mile (2.5 square kilometer) section of downtown that includes the area where protests have occurred since Friday. The city of Los Angeles encompasses roughly 500 square miles (nearly 2,300 square kilometers).",
      "The curfew doesn\u2019t apply to residents who live in the designated area, people who are homeless, credentialed media or public safety and emergency officials, according to Los Angeles Police Chief Jim McDonnell.",
      "McDonnell said \u201cunlawful and dangerous behavior\u201d had been escalating since Saturday.",
      "\u201cThe curfew is a necessary measure to protect lives and safeguard property following several consecutive days of growing unrest throughout the city,\u201d McDonnell said.",
      "Trump left open the possibility of invoking the Insurrection Act, which authorizes the president to deploy military forces inside the U.S. to suppress rebellion or domestic violence or to enforce the law in certain situations. It's one of the most extreme emergency powers available to a U.S. president.",
      "\u201cIf there\u2019s an insurrection, I would certainly invoke it. We\u2019ll see,\u201d he said from the Oval Office.",

      "Trump has described Los Angeles in dire terms that Bass and Newsom say are nowhere close to the truth.",
      "In a public address Tuesday evening, Newsom called Trump\u2019s actions the start of an \u201cassault\u201d on democracy.",
      "\u201cCalifornia may be first, but it clearly will not end here. Other states are next,\u201d he said.",
      "Newsom warned people against inciting violence, but urged them to stand up to the president's actions.",
      "\u201cWhat Donald Trump wants most is your fealty, your silence. To be complicit in this moment,\" he said. \u201cDo not give it to him.\u201d",
      "The protests began Friday after federal immigration raids arrested dozens of workers in Los Angeles. Protesters blocked a major freeway and set cars on fire over the weekend, and police responded with tear gas, rubber bullets and flash-bang grenades.",
      "The demonstrations have been mostly concentrated downtown in the city of 4 million. Thousands of people have peacefully rallied outside City Hall and hundreds more protested outside a federal complex that includes a detention center where some immigrants are being held following workplace raids.",
      "Despite the protests, immigration enforcement activity has continued throughout the county, with city leaders and community groups reporting ICE present at libraries, car washes and Home Depots. School graduations in Los Angeles have increased security over fears of ICE action and some have offered parents the option to watch on Zoom.",

      "Several businesses were broken into Monday, though authorities didn't say if the looting was tied to the protests.",
      "The vast majority of arrests have been for failing to disperse, while a few others were for assault with a deadly weapon, looting, vandalism and attempted murder for tossing a Molotov cocktail. Seven police officers were reportedly injured, and at least two were taken to a hospital and released.",

      "NEW YORK -- President Donald Trump\u2019s quest to erase his criminal conviction heads to a federal appeals court Wednesday. It\u2019s one way he\u2019s trying to get last year\u2019s hush money verdict overturned.",
      "A three-judge panel is set to hear arguments in Trump's long-running fight to get the New York case moved from state court to federal court, where he could then try to have the verdict thrown out on presidential immunity grounds.",
      "The Republican is asking the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to intervene after a lower-court judge twice rejected the move. As part of the request, Trump wants the federal appeals court to seize control of the criminal case and then ultimately decide his appeal of the verdict, which is now pending in a state appellate court.",
      "The 2nd Circuit should \u201cdetermine once and for all that this unprecedented criminal prosecution of a former and current President of the United States belongs in federal court,\" Trump's lawyers wrote in a court filing.",
      "The Manhattan district attorney\u2019s office, which prosecuted Trump\u2019s case, wants it to stay in state court. Trump\u2019s Justice Department \u2014 now partly run by his former criminal defense lawyers \u2014 backs his bid to move the case to federal court.",
      "If Trump loses, he could go to the U.S. Supreme Court.",
      "Trump was convicted in May 2024 of 34 felony counts of falsifying business records to conceal a hush money payment to porn actor Stormy Daniels, whose affair allegations threatened to upend his 2016 presidential campaign. Trump denies her claim and said he did nothing wrong. It was the only one of his four criminal cases to go to trial.",
      "Trump's lawyers first sought to move the case to federal court following his March 2023 indictment, arguing that federal officers including former presidents have the right to be tried in federal court for charges arising from \u201cconduct performed while in office.\u201d Part of the criminal case involved checks he wrote while he was president.",
      "They tried again after his conviction, arguing that Trump\u2019s historic prosecution violated his constitutional rights and ran afoul of the Supreme Court\u2019s presidential immunity ruling, which was decided about a month after the hush money trial ended.",
      "The ruling reins in prosecutions of ex-presidents for official acts and restricts prosecutors in pointing to official acts as evidence that a president\u2019s unofficial actions were illegal.",
      "U.S. District Judge Alvin Hellerstein denied both requests, ruling in part that Trump\u2019s conviction involved his personal life, not his work as president.",
      "In a four-page ruling, Hellerstein wrote that nothing about the high court\u2019s ruling affected his prior conclusion that hush money payments at issue in Trump\u2019s case \u201cwere private, unofficial acts, outside the bounds of executive authority.\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s lawyers argue that prosecutors rushed to trial instead of waiting for the Supreme Court\u2019s presidential immunity decision, and that prosecutors erred by showing jurors evidence that should not have been allowed under the ruling, such as former White House staffers describing how Trump reacted to news coverage of the hush money deal and tweets he sent while president in 2018.",
      "Trump\u2019s former criminal defense lawyer Todd Blanche is now the deputy U.S. attorney general, the Justice Department\u2019s second-in-command. Another of his lawyers, Emil Bove, has a high-ranking Justice Department position.",

      "At the time, it was the worst mass shooting in modern U.S. history. The Pulse shooting\u2019s death toll was surpassed the following year when 58 people were killed and more than 850 injured among a crowd of 22,000 at a country music festival in Las Vegas.",
      "The city of Orlando purchased the Pulse property in 2023 for $2 million and plans to build a $12 million permanent memorial which will open in 2027. Those efforts follow a multiyear, botched attempt by a private foundation run by the club's former owner. The existing structure will be razed later this year.",
      "\u201cNone of us thought that it would take nine years to get to this point and we can\u2019t go back and relitigate all of the failures along the way that have happened, but what we can do is control how we move forward together,\" Orange County Mayor Jerry Demings said two weeks ago when county commissioners pledged $5 million to support the city of Orlando\u2019s plan.",
      "The opportunity to go inside the nightclub comes on the ninth anniversary of the mass shooting. Outside, over-sized photos of the victims, rainbow-colored flags and flowers have hung on fences in a makeshift memorial, and the site has attracted visitors from around the globe. But very few people other than investigators have been inside the structure.",
      "Around 250 survivors and family members of those killed have responded to the city's invitation to walk through the nightclub this week. Families of the 49 people who were killed can visit the site with up to six people in their group, and survivors can bring one person with them.",
      "The people invited to visit are being given the chance to ask FBI agents who investigated the massacre about what happened. They won't be allowed to take photos or video inside.",
      "Brandon Wolf, who hid in a bathroom as the gunman opened fire, said he wasn't going to visit, primarily because he now lives in Washington. He said he wanted to remember Pulse as it was before.",
      "\u201cI will say that the site of the tragedy is where I feel closest to the people who were stolen from me,\u201d said Wolf, who now is national press secretary for the Human Rights Campaign, a LGBTQ+ advocacy group. \u201cFor survivors, the last time they were in that space was the worst night possible. It will be really hard to be in that space again.\u201d",
      "Mental health counselors planned to be on hand to talk to those who walk through the building.",
      "Survivors and family members had hoped to have a permanent memorial in place by now. But an earlier effort by a private foundation to build one floundered, and the organization disbanded in 2023.",
      "Barbara and Rosario Poma and businessman Michael Panaggio previously owned the property, and Barbara Poma was the executive director of the onePulse Foundation \u2014 the nonprofit that had been leading efforts to build a memorial and museum. She stepped down as executive director in 2022 and then left the organization entirely in 2023 amid criticism that she wanted to sell instead of donate the property. There were also complaints about the lack of progress despite millions of dollars being raised.",
      "The original project, unveiled in 2019 by the onePulse Foundation, called for a museum and permanent memorial costing $45 million. That estimate eventually soared to $100 million. The city of Orlando has since outlined a more modest proposal and scrapped plans for a museum.",
      "\u201cThe building may come down, and we may finally get, a permanent memorial, but that doesn\u2019t change the fact that this community has been scarred for life,\u201d Wolf said. \u201cThere are people inside the community who still need and will continue to need support and resources.\u201d",

      "NEW YORK -- Jurors in Harvey Weinstein'ssex crimes retrial are drilling down on one of the three charges against him: a rape accusation from a woman who also said she had a consensual relationship with him.",
      "The seven female and five male jurors are poised to start their fifth day of deliberations Wednesday by re-hearing Jessica Mann's testimony that he raped her in a Manhattan hotel room in 2013.",
      "Mann's accusation was an apparent focus of Tuesday\u2019s deliberations, and the jury ended the day by asking to be re-read her testimony about what happened between her and Weinstein at the hotel. The group also indicated it wants to continue privately reviewing her emails with Weinstein and some 2017 medical records concerning her reaction to news accounts of other women\u2019s allegations against him.",
      "The former Hollywood powerbroker, 73, has pleaded not guilty to raping Mann and to forcing oral sex on two other women, Mimi Haley and Kaja Sokola. The Oscar-winning producer maintains that he never sexually assaulted or raped anyone, and his lawyers portrayed his accusers as opportunists who accepted his advances because they wanted a leg up in the entertainment world.",
      "While all three women stayed in contact with Weinstein despite what they say were assaults, Mann had a particularly complex history with him. During days on the witness stand, she testified that they had a consensual relationship that exploded into rape, yet continued afterward.",
      "Weinstein was one of the movie industry\u2019s most powerful figures until a series of sexual misconduct allegations against him became public in 2017, fueling the #MeToo movement and eventually leading to criminal charges.",
      "He originally was convicted in 2020 of raping Mann and forcing oral sex on Haley. Sokola\u2019s allegation was added last year, after New York state\u2019s highest court overturned the 2020 conviction and sent the case back for retrial. Meanwhile, Weinstein is appealing a 2022 rape conviction in Los Angeles.",
      "After a couple of days of apparent interpersonal friction, the retrial jury worked through Tuesday with no further complaints.",
      "The Associated Press generally does not identify people without their permission if they say they have been sexually assaulted. Sokola, Mann and Haley have agreed to be named.",

      "LOS ANGELES -- Jacob Vasquez began working at a clothing warehouse in Los Angeles soon after arriving from Mexico less than three years ago.",
      "He is among dozens of workers detained by federal immigration authorities in a series of raids in LA\u2019s fashion district and at Home Depot parking lots in Southern California. More than 100 people have been detained.",
      "The raids have triggered days of turbulent protests across the city and beyond and led President Donald Trump to deploy National Guard troops and Marines to the LA area, the latest development in the administration\u2019s immigration crackdown. Protests in the city\u2019s downtown have ranged from peaceful to raucous, with demonstrators blocking a major freeway and setting cars on fire over the weekend.",
      "Immigrant advocates say the workers who were detained do not have criminal histories and are being denied their due process rights.",
      "Vasquez has a three-month-old baby, according to his family who spoke to reporters outside the Ambiance Apparel warehouse, a clothing company founded in 1999, and where the young father worked.",
      "\u201cJacob is a family man and the sole breadwinner of his household,\u201d said his brother Gabriel, speaking in Spanish during a news conference Monday. He doesn't know if he\u2019s OK, he later said in an interview. \u201cWe don\u2019t know where he is.\u201d",
      "Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass denounced the raids and the deployment of troops, saying Tuesday that the actions were aimed at intimidating the area's vast immigrant population, one of the country's largest. She said she has heard even immigrants with legal status are being swept up and that the raids may continue for months.",
      "An estimated 950,000 people in Los Angeles County do not have legal immigration status, according to the Migration Policy Institute. That is about a tenth of the county's population, and they include cooks, nannies, hotel employees, street vendors, gardeners, construction workers and garment workers.",
      "\u201cFamilies across the city are terrified,\" Bass said. \u201cThey don\u2019t know if they should go to work, they don\u2019t know if they should go to school.\u201d",
      "She said many of those detained have had no contact with their loved ones or lawyers. The raids have only fueled unrest in the city, Bass said.",
      "\u201cThey were going to go after violent felons, drug dealers, and I don\u2019t know how that matches with the scenes that we saw of people outside Home Depot running through the parking lot, because they were afraid that they were going to get arrested,\" she said.",
      "Sara\u00ed Ortiz said her father, Jose, worked for Ambiance for 18 years. \u201cIt was really painful to see him arrested on Friday with his co-workers,\u201d she told the crowd in Spanish.",
      "A judge signed a search warrant that there was probable cause to conclude that Ambiance was using fake documents for some workers, said Ciaran McEvoy, a spokesperson for the U.S. attorney\u2019s office in Los Angeles. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security has not shared details about the arrests.",
      "\u201cAmbience Apparel has never created any fictitious documents for its workers,\" Benjamin N. Gluck, an attorney representing the company, said in a statement. \"The company obeys, and continues to obey, all applicable laws. We support our workforce, many of whom have worked faithfully for the company for decades.\u201d",
      "The Trump administration did not respond to emails from The Associated Press asking about whether any of the immigrants detained in the raids had criminal records.",
      "Los Angeles is one of the nation\u2019s largest garment-production hubs with more than 45,000 workers, mostly Latino and Asian immigrants, who cut, sew and finish the clothing, according to the Garment Worker Center.",
      "The raids are deepening fears far beyond LA and even among those who are in the country legally, immigrants said. Jot Condie, president and chief executive of the California Restaurant Association, said the fear is keeping away workers and hurting businesses. In LA County last year, food and drink services were a $30 billion industry.",
      "Outside a Home Depot in Santa Ana, California, about 30 miles (48 kilometers) southeast of Los Angeles, a handful of day laborers leaned against their cars waiting to be hired Tuesday, a day after armed Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers drove up and sent many of the workers running.",
      "Junior Ortega, 43, said he saw four people arrested by ICE, while others fled on foot or jumped into a car and peeled out of the parking lot before they were caught.",
      "\u201cThey came out with guns, (saying) \u2018don\u2019t move,' \u2019\u2019 Ortega said in Spanish. By then, the Honduran citizen who has lived nearly three decades in the U.S. said he had already taken out his green card to avoid making any sudden moves should agents approach him.",
      "One of the agents did, and while holding a gun, demanded to see his ID, Ortega said. After he showed it, he said the agent let him go.",
      "The day laborer said he recently started carrying not only his driver's license but his green card with him.",
      "While he is not directly affected by the immigration raids, Ortega said they still weigh on him and his children.",

      "Skaff served in the supermajority-Republican state House of Delegates for nearly 11 nonconsecutive years representing Kanawha County. He resigned his seat in 2023 and switched to the GOP before a failed campaign for secretary of state in 2024.",

      "The announcement came just hours after President Donald Trump previewed the decision, telling troops at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, that he was changing the names back. Fort Bragg, which was changed to Fort Liberty by the Biden administration, was the first to have its original name restored after the Army found another person with the same last name. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, who was with Trump at Fort Bragg, signed an order restoring the name in February.",

      "In March, Hegseth reversed the decision changing Fort Benning in Georgia to Fort Moore.",
      "To restore the original names of the additional seven bases, the Army once again found service members with the same last names to honor. Those bases are Fort A.P. Hill, Fort Pickett and Fort Robert E. Lee in Virginia, Fort Gordon in Georgia, Fort Hood in Texas, Fort Polk in Louisiana and Fort Rucker in Alabama.",
      "The decision strips names chosen in 2023 to honor top leaders, such as President Dwight D. Eisenhower, as well as Black soldiers and women. No women are included in the new Army list.",
      "There was no immediate cost estimate for changing all the signs at the bases, just two years after they were revamped.",
      "Originally it was named after Confederate Gen. Ambrose P. Hill, before being renamed Fort Walker after Mary Edwards Walker, a doctor who treated soldiers in the Civil War and later received a Medal of Honor.",
      "Now it will be named to commemorate three different people: Medal of Honor recipients Lt. Col. Edward Hill, 1st Sgt. Robert A. Pinn and Pvt. Bruce Anderson for heroism during the Civil War.",

He received the Distinguished Service Cross for heroism during World War II when he fired grenades while pinned down by enemy machine gun fire and destroyed enemy positions. He was captured, then escaped and rejoined his unit, but was killed in action.",
      "Fort Lee was changed to a hyphenated name, Fort Gregg-Adams, and was the only one to commemorate someone who remained alive at the time \u2014 Lt. Gen. Arthur J. Gregg. He was known as a logistics leader and died last year. Lt. Col. Charity Adams \u2014 the other half of the name \u2014 led the first female Black unit of the Army deployed in World War II.",
      "Fort Lee will now be named for Pvt. Fitz Lee, who received the Medal of Honor for heroism during the Spanish-American War, when he moved under fire to rescue wounded comrades.",
      "Fort Gordon was changed to Fort Eisenhower to commemorate the former president's time leading Allied forces in Europe in World War II.",
      "It will now be named for Medal of Honor recipient Master Sgt. Gary I. Gordon. He was honored for his valor during the 1993 Battle of Mogadishu in Somalia, where he defended wounded crew members at a helicopter crash site and held off an advancing enemy force.",

      "BILLINGS, Mont. -- Lawyers for President Donald Trump's administration say he has the authority to abolish national monuments meant to protect historical and archaeological sites across broad landscapes, including two in California created by his predecessor at the request of Native American tribes.",
      "A Justice Department legal opinion released Tuesday disavowed a 1938 determination that monuments created by previous presidents under the Antiquities Act can't be revoked. The department said presidents can cancel monument designations if protections aren't warranted.",
      "The finding comes as the Interior Department under Trump weighs changes to monuments across the nation as part of the administration's push to expand U.S. energy production.",
      "Sen. Martin Heinrich of New Mexico, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Natural Resources Committee, said that at Trump's order, \u201chis Justice Department is attempting to clear a path to erase national monuments.\"",
      "Trump in his first term reduced the size of Bears Ears and Grand Staircase Escalante National Monuments in Utah, calling them a \u201cmassive land grab.\" He also lifted fishing restrictions within a sprawling marine monument off the New England Coast.",
      "Former President Joe Biden reversed the moves and restored the monuments.",
      "The two monuments singled out in the newly released Justice Department opinion were designated by Biden in his final days in office: Chuckwalla National Monument, in Southern California near Joshua Tree National Park, and S\u00e1tt\u00edtla Highlands National Monument, in Northern California.",
      "The Democrat's declarations for the monuments barred oil and natural gas drilling and mining on the 624,000-acre (2,400-square-kilometer) Chuckwalla site, and the roughly 225,000 acres (800 square kilometers) S\u00e1tt\u00edtla Highlands site near the California-Oregon border.",
      "Chuckwalla has natural wonders including the Painted Canyon of Mecca Hills and Alligator Rock, and is home to rare species of plants and animals like the desert bighorn sheep and the Chuckwalla lizard. The S\u00e1tt\u00edtla Highlands include the ancestral homelands of the Pit River Tribe and Modoc Peoples.",
      "All but three presidents have used the 1906 Antiquities Act to protect unique landscapes and cultural resources. About half the national parks in the U.S. were first designated as monuments.",
      "But critics of monument designations under Biden and Obama say the protective boundaries were stretched too far, hindering mining for critical minerals.",
      "Deputy Assistant Attorney General Lanora Pettit wrote in the Trump administration opinion that Biden's protections of Chuckwalla and the Satt\u00edtla Highlands were part of the Democrat's attempts to create for himself an environmental legacy that includes more places to hike, bike, camp or hunt.",
      "\"Such activities are entirely expected in a park, but they are wholly unrelated to (if not outright incompatible with) the protection of scientific or historical monuments,\" Pettit wrote.",
      "Trump in April lifted commercial fishing prohibitions within an expansive marine monument in the Pacific Ocean created under former President Barack Obama.",
      "Environmental groups said Tuesday's Justice Department opinion doesn't give him the authority to shrink monuments at will.",
      "\u201cAmericans overwhelmingly support our public lands and oppose seeing them dismantled or destroyed,\u201d said Axie Navas with The Wilderness Society.",
      "Biden established 10 new monuments, among them the site of a 1908 race riot in Springfield, Illinois, and another on a sacred Native American site near the Grand Canyon.",
      "Since 1912, presidents have issued more than a dozen proclamations that diminished monuments, according to a National Park Service database.",
      "Dwight Eisenhower was most active in undoing the proclamations of his predecessors as he diminished six monuments, including Arches in Utah, Great Sand Dunes in Colorado and Glacier Bay in Alaska, which have all since become national parks.",
      "Trump's moves to shrink the Utah monuments in his first term were challenged by environmental groups that said protections for the sites safeguard water supplies and wildlife while preserving cultural sites.",
      "The reductions were reversed by Biden before the case was resolved, and it remains pending.",
      "President Theodore Roosevelt signed the Antiquities Act after lobbying by educators and scientists who wanted to protect sites from artifact looting and haphazard collecting by individuals. It was the first law in the U.S. to establish legal protections for cultural and natural resources of historic or scientific interest on federal lands.",

      "Decker was an infantryman in the U.S. Army from March 2013 to July 2021 and deployed to Afghanistan for four months in 2014. He has training in navigation, survival and other skills, authorities said. He once spent more than two months living in the backwoods off the grid.",
      "Officials with an array of state and federal agencies have searched hundreds of square miles, much of it mountainous and remote, by land, water and air. The U.S. Marshals Service was offering a reward of up to $20,000 for information leading to his capture.",
      "Last September, his ex-wife, Whitney Decker, wrote in a petition to modify their parenting plan that his mental health issues had worsened and that he had become increasingly unstable, often living out of his truck. She sought to restrict him from having overnight visits with their daughters until he found housing.",
      "An autopsy on Friday determined the cause of death to be suffocation, the sheriff\u2019s office said. The girls had been bound with zip ties and had plastic bags placed over their heads.",

      "U.S. Rep. LaMonica McIver has been indicted on federal charges alleging she assaulted and interfered with immigration officers during a skirmish outside a New Jersey detention center",
      "TRENTON, N.J. -- U.S. Rep. LaMonica McIver was indicted Tuesday on federal charges alleging she assaulted and interfered with immigration officers outside a New Jersey detention center while Newark\u2019s mayor was being arrested after he tried to join a congressional oversight visit at the facility.",
      "Acting U.S. Attorney for New Jersey Alina Habba announced the grand jury indictment in a post on X.",
      "\u201cWhile people are free to express their views for or against particular policies, they must not do so in a manner that endangers law enforcement and the communities those officers serve,\u201d Habba said.",
      "In a statement, McIver said the charges amounted to the Trump administration trying to scare her.",
      "\u201cThe facts of this case will prove I was simply doing my job and will expose these proceedings for what they are: a brazen attempt at political intimidation,\u201d she said.",
      "McIver, a Democrat, was charged in a complaint by Habba last month with two assault charges stemming from the May 9 visit to Newark\u2019s Delaney Hall \u2014 a 1,000-bed, privately owned facility that Immigration and Customs Enforcement uses as a detention center.",
      "The indictment includes three counts of assaulting, resisting, impeding and interfering with federal officials. Habba said two of the counts carry a maximum sentence of up to eight years in prison. A third has a maximum sentence of one year.",
      "McIver's lawyer, former U.S. Attorney for New Jersey Paul Fishman, said in a statement that they would challenge the allegations \u201chead-on\u201d in court.",
      "\u201cThe legal process will expose this prosecution for what it truly is -- political retaliation against a dedicated public servant who refuses to shy away from her oversight responsibilities,\u201d Fishman said.",
      "The indictment is the latest development in a legal-political drama that has seen President Donald Trump\u2019s administration take Democratic officials from New Jersey\u2019s largest city to court, tapping into the president\u2019s immigration crackdown and Democrats\u2019 efforts to respond. The prosecution of McIver is a rare federal criminal case against a sitting member of Congress for allegations other than fraud or corruption.",
      "At the same visit that resulted in McIver\u2019s charges, Newark Mayor Ras Baraka was arrested on a trespassing charge, which was later dropped. Baraka is suing Habba over what he said was a malicious prosecution.",
      "A nearly two-minute clip released by the Homeland Security Department shows McIver on the facility side of a chain-link fence just before the arrest of the mayor on the street side of the fence, where other people had been protesting. She and uniformed officials go through the gate, and she joins others shouting that they should circle the mayor. The video shows McIver in a tightly packed group of people and officers. At one point, her left elbow and then her right elbow push into an officer wearing a dark face covering and an olive green uniform emblazoned with the word \u201cPolice\u201d on it.",
      "It isn\u2019t clear from police bodycam video whether that contact was intentional, incidental or a result of jostling in the chaotic scene.",
      "The complaint says she \u201cslammed\u201d her forearm into an agent then tried to restrain the agent by grabbing him.",
      "The indictment says she placed her arms around the mayor to block his arrest and repeats the charges that she slammed her forearm into an agent and grabbed the agent.",
      "New Jersey Reps. Bonnie Watson Coleman and Rob Menendez had joined McIver at the detention center that day. They and other Democrats have criticized the arrest and disputed the charges as well.",
      "By law, members of Congress are authorized to go into federal immigration facilities as part of their oversight powers, even without notice. Congress passed a 2019 appropriations bill that spelled out the authority.",
      "McIver, 38, first came to Congress in September in a special election after the death of Rep. Donald Payne Jr. left a vacancy in the 10th District.",
      "She was then elected to a full term in November. A Newark native, she served as the president of the Newark City Council from 2022 to 2024 and worked in the city\u2019s public schools before that.",

      "As a result, when it did rain, there were excess nutrients, like nitrogen and phosphorus, that were flowing into the bay, Dennison said.",
      "\u201cNow sadly, this is kind of our future,\" Dennison said at a news conference at the Annapolis Maritime Museum near the bay. \u201cThis is the kind of weather patterns that are starting to become more common, which is drought punctuated by extreme events.\u201d",
      "Warmer weather winters and higher temperatures mean less oxygen in the water for aquatic life, stressing fish and shellfish, Dennison added.",
      "\u201cSo these are some of the things that we have to overcome and build more resilience into our system,\u201d Dennison said.",
      "Despite the grade drop, the report cited long-term improvements in dissolved oxygen in the bay's waters. That's the amount of oxygen present in the water that is needed to support bay aquatic life.",
      "The report also noted long-term improvements in aquatic grasses, which provide habitat and food for various species, improve water quality and protect shorelines from erosion.",
      "Phosphorus and nitrogen levels also have improved in the long-term in another positive sign. While they are needed by the bay's organisms, excessive nitrogen and phosphorus degrade the bay\u2019s water quality. Excess nitrogen and phosphorus fuel algal blooms that can cloud the water and block sunlight from reaching underwater grasses.",
      "Water clarity and chlorophyll-a scores, however, have declining long-term trends, the report said. Chlorophyll-a in the bay is an indicator of phytoplankton abundance and water quality.",
      "Improving trends can be attributed to management and restoration efforts at the regional, state, and local levels, the report said. Regionally, wastewater treatment plants have been upgraded and programs have been put in place to reduce nutrient and sediment input.",
      "The health of the bay is a reflection of what\u2019s happening across its six-state watershed, which includes Delaware, Maryland, New York, Pennsylvania, Virginia and West Virginia along with the District of Columbia.",
      "UMCES, which is marking its 100th anniversary, also provides a grade for the overall watershed health in its report card. It gave the watershed a grade of C-plus. The watershed health grade includes ecological, societal and economic indicators.",
      "The most concerning societal indicator was heat vulnerability, the report said, noting communities may be under heat stress due to hotter air temperatures, less tree canopy cover, and more paved surfaces.",

      "The Satanic Temple's leader in Iowa is accusing state officials of religious discrimination against the group",
      "DES MOINES, Iowa -- The Satanic Temple Iowa on Tuesday filed a complaint accusing state officials of discriminating against the group because of its members' religion, having denied them access to the state Capitol building for a December holiday display and event.",
      "The group\u2019s holiday observances garnered national attention in 2023 after a Mississippi man destroyed their Iowa Statehouse display depicting the horned deity Baphomet, which was permitted in the rotunda along with a Christmas tree and other religious holiday installations.",
      "The temple's application for a display and event in December 2024 was denied, a decision that the organization says violated its members' constitutional rights and Iowa civil rights law.",
      "Messages seeking comment were left with the state\u2019s Department of Administrative Services, which oversees the use of public space in the Iowa Capitol; and with Gov. Kim Reynolds\u2019 office.",
      "The American Civil Liberties Union of Iowa filed the complaint with Iowa\u2019s civil rights office Tuesday on behalf of Mortimer Adramelech, minister of Satan for the Iowa Satanic Temple congregation. Rita Bettis Austen, ACLU Iowa's legal director, said the complaint with the civil rights office is the first step required before a legal claim of discrimination under Iowa civil rights law can be filed in court. The state's ACLU chapter hopes the complaint will be enough for state officials to reverse course.",
      "The ACLU of Iowa also filed a lawsuit in April after Gov. Kim Reynolds' office withheld or redacted requested records related to the Satanic Temple's display and event, citing executive privilege.",
      "The complaint references a decision by Adam Steen, administrative services director, to deny the group\u2019s application because obscene materials and gratuitous violence are not permitted in the building that regularly hosts children of all ages. Steen told the group the costumes they proposed for the event included sticks that could be \u201cused as weapons on children\u201d and \u201cpositions the event to be harmful to minors.\u201d",
      "The Satanic Temple alleges that was an \u201cabsurd, unfounded concern\u201d used to justify the denial and that their application specified the event would be family friendly. The complaint cites open records that the organization says make it clear the governor\u2019s office and Steen were meeting at the time to prepare a response.",
      "\u201cThe simple truth is the State of Iowa does not want to allow Satanists to enjoy the same access to the Iowa State Capitol as other \u2018mainstream\u2019 religions, in particular Christianity, and in particular during the Christmas holiday season,\u201d the complaint reads.",

      "The City Council of San Jose, California, is voting on a controversial proposal that would make homeless people eligible for arrest if they reject three offers of housing",
      "SAN FRANCISCO -- Homeless people who reject three offers of shelter could be arrested under a controversial proposal before the city council of the most populous city in California's Silicon Valley on Tuesday.",
      "The proposal being pushed by San Jose Mayor Matt Mahon is eye-opening because it comes from a liberal city headed by a Democrat in the left-leaning San Francisco Bay Area. It is among the stricter anti-encampment deterrents proposed by elected officials since the Supreme Court in 2023 made it easier to ban homeless people from camping on public property.",
      "And it's another sign of just how frustrated people have become with squalid tents lining sidewalks and riverbanks, and erratic behavior of those using drugs or in distress in a state with an estimated 187,000 homeless people. California is home to roughly a quarter of all homeless people in the country.",
      "Mahan says most people do accept offers of shelter. But he wants to make clear to the small percentage of people who refuse, that as the city builds more shelter and interim housing, they have a responsibility to move indoors.",
      "\u201cI think we need a cultural change, a culture of accountability for everyone involved,\u201d said Mahan. \u201cI don\u2019t want to use the criminal justice system to make vulnerable people\u2019s lives harder. I want to use it as a last resort.\u201d",
      "California Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat and former mayor of San Francisco, has repeatedly urged cities to ban encampments. Arrests for illegal lodging have soared in San Francisco, and its current mayor, Daniel Lurie, has reiterated that it is not appropriate for people to live outdoors.",
      "Advocates for homeless people say cracking down on encampments is traumatizing and even counterproductive. Forcing a person to clear out sets them back in their search for stability as they could lose important documents needed to apply for work and housing, they said.",
      "\u201cPushing people with mental health needs or drug addiction into incarceration \u2014 without any crime committed \u2014 is both inhumane and ineffective,\u201d said Otto Lee, president of the Santa Clara County Board of Supervisors, in a written statement emailed Monday to The Associated Press.",
      "Lee and other county leaders are opposed to the mayor's proposal. They say they need more housing, beds and services, and not punishment.",
      "The \u201cresponsibility to shelter\u201d proposal does not mandate an arrest after three rejected offers. After talking with the city attorney's office and police, Mahan said it made more sense to give front-line outreach workers and police officers discretion to decide when to escalate or prioritize a situation. The city will set up a new six-officer quality of life unit within the police department.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t want to overly tie their hands and tell them this is the only way to do it,\u201d the mayor said.",
      "People who repeatedly violate the city's encampment code of conduct \u2014 which also includes keeping tents free of trash and not blocking the public right of way \u2014 could be sent to a recovery center for detox or petitioned for court-mandated treatment to mental health and substance use disorder care, Mahan said.",
      "San Jose has nearly 1,400 shelter spots and hopes to add another 800 by the end of the year. Officials are aware they do not have enough beds, and Mahan said that people will not be punished if beds are unavailable or the only options are unsuitable.",

      "For more than a decade, Tribeca has been expanding its focus beyond cinema and television to include new avenues of storytelling through the use of virtual reality, augmented reality, and other nascent technologies, producing some vivid immersive displays. Even if the storytelling aspect of the programs were limited, the artistic expressions could be powerful. This was especially true with past exhibits that enveloped the viewer in massive spaces, in which computer-generated imagery or time-lapse photography placed the viewer in new worlds, from exploding galaxies to swirling blood vessels.",
      "Hosted under the umbrella title \"In Search of Us,\"\u00a0this year's installation in Lower Manhattan ties 11 projects together under the rubric of impacts on humanity \u2014 exploring topics from artificial intelligence to climate change, war, school shootings and transphobia. The exhibits with the most profound effects are those with the strongest and most emotional stories embedded inside them.",
      "Within a simple, delineated space furnished with minimal furniture, \"Fragile Home,\" by Ond\u0159ej Moravec and Victoria Lopukhina, uses mixed reality to recreate a home in Ukraine that comes under bombardment. Wearing goggles, the viewer walks through a comfortable, well-appointed living room, past a dinner table and a purring cat, and looks outside the window to a peaceful vista \u2014 all of which, in a flash, is replaced by the home's bombed-out remains, vandalized with Russian forces' \"Z\" graffiti.",

Using haptic VR, the viewer is literally strapped into a chair; electrodes are attached to your fingertips, arms, and torso, along with VR goggles. Interesting, you think. Then, the presentation begins, recounting the true story of a survivor of electroshock conversion therapy. (As a teenager, Carolyn Mercer had been \"treated\" with electrical shocks in an attempt to \"cure\" her from becoming trans.) As images of female beauty are flashed before you, electrical impulses throb across your body. This is not virtual reality; the extreme discomfort is very real, forcing me out of the presentation less than halfway through. The upshot: aversion therapy works, because I will never allow VR electrodes to be attached to my body ever again.",

    "summary": "The Health and Human Services secretary said he is \"retiring\" all 17 members of the Advisory Committee for Immunization Practices, which helps set recommendations for vaccines.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. on Monday said he is removing every member of a government panel that makes vaccine recommendations.",
      "Kennedy said he is \"retiring\" all 17 members of the Advisory Committee for Immunization Practices, asserting that it \"has become little more than a rubber stamp for any vaccine.\"",
      "\"A clean sweep is needed to re-establish public confidence in vaccine science,\" Kennedy wrote in an opinion piece published by the Wall Street Journal.",
      "On Tuesday night, Kennedy posted on X discussing the move and said he \"will use this platform to announce new members to populate ACIP.\"",
      "\"None of these individuals will be ideological anti-vaxxers. They will be highly credentialed physicians and scientists who will make extremely consequential public health determinations by applying evidence-based decision-making with objectivity and common sense,\" he wrote, in part. \"I will also be tweeting examples of the historical corruption at ACIP to help the public understand why this clean sweep was necessary.\"",
      "Kennedy's move was quickly rebuked by a number of doctors groups. A statement released by the American Medical Association said it \"upends a transparent process that has saved countless lives.\" The American Academy of Pediatrics called it\u00a0part of an \"escalating effort by the Administration to silence independent medical expertise and stoke distrust in lifesaving vaccines.\"",
      "It comes after months of criticism over how Kennedy has wielded his authority and platform as the head of the nation's public health agencies, including\u00a0ordering changes to COVID-19 vaccine guidance, terminating bird flu vaccine\u00a0research funding, forcing out federal vaccines officials and spreading myths about\u00a0measles shots.",
      "The members of the committee are independent medical and public health experts who advise and vote on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's vaccine recommendations. The CDC sets immunization schedules for both adults and children based on recommendations from ACIP.",
      "Experts and health authorities closely watch the committee's decisions, since their recommendations are tied to a number of federal policies, including requirements for insurance coverage and liability protections.",
      "\"Per the June 9, 2025 directive from the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, this email serves as formal notice of your immediate termination as a member of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP). We appreciate your prior service and commitment,\" read an email to one committee member from the CDC.",
      "\"This is horrifying,\" a CDC official said of Kennedy's move.",
      "The American Public Health Association\u00a0denounced\u00a0it as an undemocratic \"coup\" of the process. The Infectious Disease Society of America called it \"reckless, shortsighted and severely harmful.\" The American College of Physicians accused Kennedy of having \"circumvented the standard, transparent vaccine review processes\" at the CDC.",
      "\"Today's announcement will seriously erode public confidence in our government's ability to ensure the health of the American public and it will endanger the safety, welfare and lives of our patients,\" Dr. Jason Goldman, the group's president and a liaison to the committee, said in\u00a0a statement.",
      "Kennedy raised concern about conflicts of interest among ACIP members, but Dr. C\u00e9line Gounder, CBS News medical contributor and editor-at-large for public health at KFF Health News, said the committee members cannot own stock in or be on any kind of advisory board for pharmaceutical companies.",
      "\"Kennedy, on the other hand, is conflicted,\" Gounder said on \"CBS Mornings.\" \"He has sued multiple vaccine manufacturers. He has stood to gain or lose from the outcome of these decisions. That is by definition conflicted.\"",
      "Sen. Bill Cassidy, a physician and the top Republican in the Senate's health committee, also expressed concern, saying \"now the fear is that the ACIP will be filled up with people who know nothing about vaccines except suspicion.\"",
      "\"I've just spoken with Secretary Kennedy, and I'll continue to talk with him to ensure this is not the case,\" Cassidy\u00a0posted on X.",
      "Cassidy had been a key vote in Kennedy's confirmation process, coming out in favor of Kennedy's nomination only after Kennedy offered a number of reassurances, including to \"maintain\" the committee \"without changes.\"",
      "Career CDC officials usually select experts to sit on the committee out of the applications it receives, forwarding picks to the secretary to be signed off on.",
      "Kennedy said the Trump administration would not have been able to appoint a majority of new members until 2028 because some of the current members were last-minute appointees of the Biden administration.",
      "\"The prior administration made a concerted effort to lock in public health ideology and limit the incoming administration's ability to take the proper actions to restore public trust in vaccines,\" Kennedy said.",
      "It is unclear who is being considered to replace the committee's members or how they are being selected. A spokesperson for the department did not comment when asked.",
      "The move comes a week after a committee leader, Dr. Lakshmi Panagiotakopoulos, resigned from her role following an order from Kennedy to change the CDC's guidance on COVID-19 vaccine recommendations.",
      "Outside groups criticized\u00a0the edits forced by Kennedy, which bypassed the longstanding advisory committee process and usurped an already-ongoing work group within the panel that had been weighing how to narrow COVID-19 vaccine recommendations.",
      "Kennedy's ouster of the committee's members comes ahead of a meeting of the panel scheduled to start on June 25. The panel was expected to vote on new recommendations for COVID-19 and other vaccines.",
      "Updates voted on from the last committee meeting in April to RSV and meningococcal vaccine recommendations were never adopted by Kennedy.",

    "summary": "Passing nurses Sabrina Castle and Gianna Formisano saved the life of Merryl Hoffman when she experienced a sudden cardiac arrest.",
    "story": [
      "Merryl Hoffman knew she was taking good care of her heart. The 63-year-old attorney didn't smoke or drink, and she was an avid hiker who used to run marathons and other distance races. In her 40s, she had been diagnosed with a leaky mitral valve and underwent surgery to repair it. Every year since, she has seen a cardiologist to check her heart and its function. The reports always came back clear.",
      "When Hoffman left her apartment on Manhattan's Upper East Side on Oct. 23, 2024, her heart was the last thing on her mind. She was saddled with her work bag and purse, hightailing it to the subway station so she could make it to work on time. That's when her memory of the day ends.",
      "Shortly into her walk, Hoffman experienced a sudden cardiac arrest. Her heart stopped beating. She collapsed to the ground. Doctors later told her it was a severe arrhythmia that could have been fatal \u2014 if not for where Hoffman fell.",
      "Hoffman had collapsed outside Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center's Breast and Imaging Center, about two and a half blocks from her subway station. A patient care technician and a passing runner immediately rushed to her aid. Then, Memorial Sloan Kettering nurses Sabrina Castle and Gianna Formisano stumbled upon the scene while walking to work.",
      "\"We were so shocked. When we were walking up, people were like 'Nurses, nurses!' We didn't know what we were walking into,\" Formisano said. \"People were grabbing our coffee, taking our bags. It was out of a movie, the way that they were like 'Oh, thank God you're here.'\"",
      "\"They absolutely saved my life\"",
      "Formisano and Castle took over performing CPR, keeping Hoffman's heart manually beating. She didn't have a pulse, and she had hit her head when she collapsed. The nurses also instructed one of the other bystanders to call an ambulance.",
      "Early CPR increases survival for patients in cardiac arrest by \"at least two or three fold,\" said Dr. Jessica Hennessey, a cardiologist at NewYork-Presbyterian/Columbia University Irving Medical Center. Early CPR means that blood flow to the brain and heart continues, preserving the health of those organs. Bystanders in a medical emergency should call 911 and immediately start CPR, Hennessey advised. CPR can be done with mouth-to-mouth or with just chest compressions, Hennessey said.",
      "After five minutes that \"felt like forever,\" the ambulance arrived, Formisano said. Castle and Formisano helped the EMTs load Hoffman into the ambulance. Then, she was taken to NewYork-Presbyterian's cardiac care unit for further treatment.",
      "For the small crowd, the day carried on. Castle and Formisano headed to work. After a few hours, they called NewYork-Presbyterian to see if they could find out more about Hoffman's status. They went to the hospital and spoke to a nurse there.",
      "\"She was like, 'You got her back. She's intubated, she's alive, you saved her life,'\" Castle recalled.",
      "Hoffman was still unconscious. She told CBS News that she didn't wake up until five days after the collapse. Her family told her that she had been rushed into surgery. Doctors told her that her heart had stopped for several minutes \u2014\u00a0and the actions of Castle, Formisano and other bystanders had saved her.",
      "\"Without them, I was told, there was no doubt I would have died or been brain dead,\" Hoffman said. \"They absolutely saved my life.\"",
      "Hoffman had an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator placed in her chest to prevent further cardiac arrests. The device shocks the heart if it detects an irregular heartbeat. She also began cardiac rehabilitation. Shortly after, she returned to work. Life began to get back to normal but one question was constantly at the back of her mind: Who had helped save her?",
      "A chance reunion",
      "While in cardiac rehabilitation, Hoffman found herself telling the story of the strangers who had helped her. A physiologist there overheard her talking about it and thought the story sounded familiar. His girlfriend was friends with two nurses who had helped a woman matching Hoffman's description. After some back and forth, the physiologist connected Hoffman with Castle and Formisano.",
      "The trio immediately made plans to get dinner. Hoffman's husband joined them for the meal. There, the nurses were able to fill in the gaps of the October morning when Hoffman collapsed.",
      "\"It was very jarring, when they gave my husband and I the blow-by-blow of that morning. There were things we did not know,\" Hoffman said. \"It was pretty incredible.\"",
      "Since that dinner, the women have stayed in touch. Recently, Castle and Formisano even passed Hoffman on the same block where she had collapsed. The three took a photo at the site.",
      "\"We were like, 'Wow, this is really crazy,'\" Formisano said. \"'We're running into you on the same spot, on your way to work, on our way to work, but now you're alive and well and in a much different state than when we met you the first time.'\"",

    "published": "Thu, 05 Jun 2025 05:00:00 -0400",
    "summary": "The Trump administration wants to shutter the CDC's National Asthma Control Program, which provides millions in funding to state-administered initiatives aimed at fighting the disease.",
    "story": [
      "Esther Bejarano's son was 11 months old when asthma landed him in the hospital. She didn't know what had triggered his symptoms \u2014 neither she nor her husband had asthma \u2014 but she suspected it was the pesticides sprayed on the agricultural fields near her family's home.",
      "Pesticides are a known contributor to asthma and are commonly used where Bejarano lives in California's Imperial Valley, a landlocked region that straddles two counties on the U.S.-Mexico border and is one of the main producers of the nation's winter crops. It also has some of the worst air pollution in the nation and one of the highest rates of childhood asthma emergency room visits in the state, according to data collected by the California Department of Public Health.",
      "Bejarano has since learned to manage her now-19-year-old son's asthma and works at Comite Civico del Valle, a local rights organization focused on environmental justice in the Imperial Valley. The organization trains health care workers to educate patients on proper asthma management, enabling them to avoid hospitalization and eliminate triggers at home. The course is so popular that there's a waiting list, Bejarano said.",
      "But the group's Asthma Management Academy program and similar initiatives nationwide face extinction with the Trump administration's mass layoffs, grant cancellations, and proposed budget cuts at the Department of Health and Human Services and the Environmental Protection Agency. Asthma experts fear the cumulative impact of the reductions could result in more ER visits and deaths, particularly for children and people in low-income communities \u2014 populations disproportionately vulnerable to the disease.",
      "\"Asthma is a preventive condition,\" Bejarano said. \"No one should die of asthma.\"",
      "Asthma can block airways, making it hard to breathe, and in severe cases can cause death if not treated quickly. Nearly 28 million people in the U.S. have asthma, and about 10 people still die every day from the disease, according to the Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America.",
      "In May, the White House released a budget proposal that would permanently shutter\u00a0the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Asthma Control Program, which was already gutted by federal health department layoffs in April. It's unclear whether Congress will approve the closure.",
      "Last year, the program allotted $33.5 million to state-administered initiatives in 27 states, Puerto Rico, and Washington, D.C., to help communities with asthma education. The funding is distributed in four-year grant cycles, during which the programs receive up to $725,000 each annually.",
      "Comite Civico del Valle's academy in Southern California, a clinician workshop in Houston, and asthma medical management training in Allentown, Pennsylvania \u2014 ranked the most challenging U.S. city to live in with asthma \u2014 are among the programs largely surviving on these grants. The first year of the current grant cycle ends Aug. 31, and it's unknown whether funding will continue beyond then.",
      "Data suggests that the CDC's National Asthma Control Program has had a significant impact. The agency's own research has shown that the program saves $71 in health care costs for every $1 invested. And the asthma death rate decreased 44% between the 1999 launch of the program and 2021, according to the American Lung Association.",
      "\"Losing support from the CDC will have devastating impacts on asthma programs in states and communities across the country, programs that we know are improving the lives of millions of people with asthma,\" said Anne Kelsey Lamb, director of the Public Health Institute's Regional Asthma Management and Prevention program. \"And the thing is that we know a lot about what works to help people keep their asthma well controlled, and that's why it's so devastating.\"",
      "The Trump administration cited cost savings and efficiency in its April announcement of the cuts to HHS. Requests for comment from the White House and HHS's CDC about cuts to federal asthma and related programs were not answered.",
      "The information wars",
      "Fresno, in the heart of California's Central Valley, is one of the country's top 20 \"asthma capitals,\" with high rates of asthma and related emergencies and deaths. It's home to programs that receive funding through the National Asthma Control Program. Health care professionals there also rely on another aspect of the program that is under threat if it's shuttered: countrywide data.",
      "The federal asthma program collects information on asthma rates and offers a tool to study prevalence and rates of death from the disease, see what populations are most affected, and assess state and local trends. Asthma educators and health care providers worry that the loss of these numbers could be the biggest impact of the cuts, because it would mean a dearth of information crucial to forming educated recommendations and treatment plans.",
      "\"How do we justify the services we provide if the data isn't there?\" said Graciela Anaya, director of community health at the Central California Asthma Collaborative in Fresno.",
      "Mitchell Grayson, chair of the Asthma and Allergy Foundation's Medical Scientific Council, is similarly concerned.",
      "\"My fear is we're going to live in a world that is frozen in Jan. 19, 2025, as far as data, because that was the last time you know that this information was safely collected,\" he said.",
      "Grayson, an allergist who practices in Columbus, Ohio, said he also worries government websites will delete important recommendations that asthma sufferers avoid heavy air pollution, get annual flu shots, and get COVID-19 vaccines.",
      "Disproportionate risk",
      "Asthma disproportionately affects communities of color because of \"historic structural issues,\" said Lynda Mitchell, CEO of the Asthma and Allergy Network, citing a higher likelihood of living in public housing or near highways and other pollution sources.",
      "She and other experts in the field said cuts to diversity initiatives across federal agencies, combined with the rollback of environmental protections, will have an outsize impact on these at-risk populations.",
      "In December, the Biden administration awarded nearly $1.6 billion through the EPA's Community Change Grants program to help disadvantaged communities address pollution and climate threats. The Trump administration moved to cut this funding in March. The grant freezes, which have been temporarily blocked by the courts, are part of a broader effort by the Trump EPA to eliminate aid to environmental justice programs across the agency.",
      "In 2023 and 2024, the National Institutes of Health's Climate Change and Health Initiative received $40 million for research, including on the link between asthma and climate change. The Trump administration has moved to cut that money. And a March memo essentially halted all NIH grants focused on diversity, equity, and inclusion, or DEI \u2014 funds many of the asthma programs serving low-income communities rely on to operate.",
      "On top of those cuts, environmental advocates like Isabel Gonz\u00e1lez Whitaker of Memphis, Tennessee, worry that the proposed reversals of environmental regulations will further harm the health of communities like hers that are already reeling from the effects of climate change. Shelby County, home to Memphis, recently received an F on the American Lung Association's annual report card for having so many high ozone days. Gonz\u00e1lez Whitaker is director of EcoMadres, a program within the national organization Moms for Clean Air that advocates for better environmental conditions for Latino communities.",
      "\"Urgent asthma needs in communities are getting defunded at a time when I just see things getting worse in terms of deregulation,\" said Gonz\u00e1lez Whitaker, who took her 12-year-old son to the hospital because of breathing issues for the first time this year. \"We're being assaulted by this data and science, which is clearly stating that we need to be doing better around preserving the regulations.\"",
      "Back in California's Imperial Valley \u2014 where the majority-Hispanic, working-class population surrounds California's largest lake, the Salton Sea \u2014 is an area called Bombay Beach. Bejarano calls it the \"forgotten community.\" Homes there lack clean running water, because of naturally occurring arsenic in the groundwater, and residents frequently experience a smell like rotten eggs blowing off the drying lakebed, exposing decades of pesticide-tinged dirt.",
      "In 2022, a 12-year-old girl died in Bombay Beach after an asthma attack. Bejarano said she later learned that the girl's school had recommended that she take part in Comite Civico del Valle's at-home asthma education program. She said the girl was on the waiting list when she died.",
      "\"It hit home. Her death showed the personal need we have here in Imperial County,\" Bejarano said. \"Deaths are preventable. Asthma is reversible. If you have asthma, you should be able to live a healthy life.\"",

    "published": "Wed, 11 Jun 2025 07:09:50 -0400",
    "summary": "President Trump's wide-reaching tariffs \u2014 including his \"Liberation Day\" levies \u2014 can stay in place until at least the end of July, an appeals court indicated.",
    "story": [
      "The wide-reaching tariffs imposed by President Trump on virtually every country can remain in place until at least the end of July, an appellate court said Tuesday evening.",
      "The Federal Circuit Court of Appeals granted the Trump administration's request to pause a lower court ruling that blocked the tariffs pending appeal. The appellate judges scheduled oral arguments in the case on July 31, meaning the tariffs are set to stay in effect until then unless there's further court action in the case.",
      "The U.S. Court of International Trade ruled last month that many of Mr. Trump's signature tariffs are illegal, including the 10% tariffs on virtually every U.S. trading partner and a set of tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China. The appellate court quickly paused that ruling from taking effect until further notice \u2014 ahead of Tuesday's longer-lasting pause.",
      "Tuesday's ruling was unsigned and did not include the court's reasoning.",
      "In\u00a0a post on his Truth Social platform Wednesday morning, Mr. Trump said, \"A Federal Appeals Court has just ruled that the United States can use TARIFFS to protect itself against other countries. A great and important win for the U.S.\"",
      "The appellate ruling extends a legal battle over the fate of the tariffs. The president put levies in place on imports from Canada, China and Mexico early in his term, citing the flow of drugs and unauthorized immigration. Then, on a day in early April he dubbed \"Liberation Day,\" Mr. Trump imposed across-the-board 10% tariffs on most countries \u2014 along with much higher \"reciprocal\" tariffs on dozens of trading partners that he accused of unfair trade practices.",
      "Mr. Trump has justified many of those tariffs using a 1977 law that lets the president regulate imports during emergency situations. But a group of businesses and state governments sued, arguing he doesn't have the legal authority. The U.S. Court of International Trade sided with the plaintiffs, concluding that the 1977 law doesn't allow the tariffs \u2014 and even if it did, it would be unconstitutional for a law passed by Congress to give the president blanket power to levy tariffs.",
      "The trade war has rocked markets and drawn criticism from members of both parties, but Mr. Trump has stood by his tariffs, arguing they're necessary to fix trade imbalances and restore U.S. manufacturing.",
      "The 10% tariffs have stayed in place, though the \"reciprocal\" tariffs are largely on hold as the Trump administration seeks to strike trade deals with other countries, and many Canadian and Mexican goods are exempted from the levies on those countries. Chinese goods\u00a0face 30% tariffs \u2014 down from 145% following an agreement between the U.S. and China.",

    "summary": "The U.S. and China have agreed on a \"framework\" to resolve some disputes that threatened to derail fragile talks between the two countries.",
    "story": [
      "Senior U.S. and Chinese negotiators have agreed on a \"framework\" to move forward on trade talks after a series of disputes had threatened to derail them, representatives from both sides said.",
      "The disputes \u2014 over visas, minerals and microchips \u2014 had shaken a fragile truce reached in Geneva last month to ease some of the massive tariffs that both countries had imposed on each other, leading to a phone call last week between President Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping to try to calm the waters. Tuesday night's announcement of an apparent thaw in relations followed two days of talks in London.",
      "Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told reporters late Tuesday that negotiators have \"reached a framework to implement the Geneva consensus.\" He said the U.S. and Chinese sides will now go back to Mr. Trump and Xi, respectively, and they can start implementing their agreement if the two leaders approve.",
      "Chinese negotiator Li Chenggang, a vice minister of commerce and China's international trade representative, also said the two sides had agreed in principle on a framework, Chinese state media said.",
      "Further details, including any plans for a potential next round of talks, were not immediately available.",
      "The two sides had agreed in Geneva to a 90-day suspension of most of the 100%-plus tariffs they had imposed on each other in an escalating trade war that had sparked fears of a recession. Mr. Trump imposed large-scale tariffs on imports from China, leading to Chinese retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods earlier this year.",
      "But since the Geneva talks, the U.S. and China have exchanged angry words over advanced semiconductors that power artificial intelligence, visas for Chinese students at American universities and rare earth minerals that are vital to carmakers and other industries.",
      "China, the world's biggest producer of rare earths, has signaled it may ease export restrictions it placed on the elements in April. The restrictions alarmed automakers around the world who rely on them. Beijing, in turn, wants the U.S. to lift restrictions on Chinese access to the technology used to make advanced semiconductors.",
      "Meanwhile, China has pushed back on the Trump administration's vow to \"aggressively revoke\" the visas of some Chinese students who are studying at U.S. colleges, calling the move \"politically motivated and discriminatory.\"",
      "Mr. Trump accused the Chinese side of violating the terms of the deal.",
      "\"So much for being Mr. NICE GUY,\" the president wrote on Truth Social late last month.",
      "Days later, China said the Trump administration had \"unilaterally provoked new economic and trade frictions.\"",
      "Wendy Cutler, a former U.S. trade negotiator, said the disputes had frittered away 30 of the 90 days the two sides have to try to resolve their disputes, before massive tariffs go back into effect.",
      "\"The U.S. and China lost valuable time in restoring their Geneva agreements,\" Cutler, now vice president at the Asia Society Policy Institute, told the Associated Press. \"Now, only sixty days remain to address issues of concern, including unfair trade practices, excess capacity, transshipment and fentanyl.\"",
      "Cutler said it would be unprecedented for the U.S. to negotiate on its export controls, which she described as an irritant that China has been raising for nearly 20 years.",
      "\"By doing so, the U.S. has opened a door for China to insist on adding export controls to future negotiating agendas,\" she said.",
      "Mr. Trump said earlier that he wants to \"open up China,\" the world's dominant manufacturer, to U.S. products.",
      "\"If we don't open up China, maybe we won't do anything,\" he said at the White House. \"But we want to open up China.\"",

    "summary": "Here's why McDonald's is more exposed than other fast-food brands to shifts in eating habits as a result of weight-loss drugs.",
    "story": [
      "McDonald's shares dropped Tuesday as weight-loss drugs threaten to take a big bite out of the fast food chain's earnings.",
      "Shares were down by as much as 1.7% Tuesday, after equity analysis firm Redburn Atlantic downgraded the burger giant's stock rating two notches, from buy to sell.",
      "Changes in Americans' eating habits spurred by the use of the class of drugs known as GLP-1s, which are designed to help regulate users' blood sugar and appetite, pose an underappreciated threat to some food businesses, according to Redburn Atlantic analysts Chris Luyckx and Edward Lewis.",
      "As a result, McDonald's could lose up to 28 million customer visits, resulting in a revenue loss of $482 million per year \u2014 about 0.9% of the company's sales, according to the analysis.",
      "The appetite-suppressing drugs are expected to have a transformative effect on how Americans consume food. At particular risk are brands that cater to lower-income consumers \u2014 a category to which McDonald's belongs.",
      "That's because spending on food away from home among lower-income households who start using GLP-1 drugs declines and tends to remain depressed, according to the report, creating \"material implications for chains with broad mass-market exposure.\"",
      "Higher-income users of the drugs, by contrast, decrease their spending before reverting to old spending patterns within one year, the analysis found.",
      "\"Behaviour changes extend beyond the individual user \u2014 reshaping group dining, influencing household routines and softening habitual demand. A 1% drag today could easily build to 10% or more over time, particularly for brands skewed toward lower income consumers or group occasions,\" the analysts said in a research note.",
      "Pricing fatigue",
      "Inflationary pressures and consumers' strained budgets only compound problems for McDonald's, according to the report.",
      "\"Consumers are showing clear signs of pricing fatigue after years of aggressive menu inflation,\" the analysts wrote. \"Although the gap between eating out and at home has narrowed, it remains historically wide, reinforcing value concerns.\"",
      "The Redburn analysis refers to GLP-1 drugs like Ozempic and Wegovy as \"demand disruptors\" for restaurants like McDonald's, because they reduce users' appetites and limit the number of calories they consume each day. These features of the drugs \"could have serious implications for the restaurant industry,\" Redburn analysts wrote.",
      "To be sure, adoption of the drugs is not yet widespread, with just 12% of U.S. adults ever having tried the meds. Currently, only 6% of the adult population uses the drugs.",
      "Wider adoption of GLP-1 drugs for weight loss could ultimately lead to a broad-based reduction in Americans' caloric intake at restaurants, including fast food joints, reversing a decades-long trend. From 1977 to 2018, the total share of calories consumed at restaurants nearly tripled, according to Redburn Atlantic's analysis of U.S. Department of Agriculture data.",
      "Compared with other fast food brands, McDonald's is the most exposed to taking a hit from the increased usage of GLP-1 drugs, according to the research.",
      "More pressing challenges",
      "However, Peter Saleh, managing director and restaurant and food distributors analyst at BTIG global financial services, said McDonald's is facing other headwinds, and he wouldn't expect GLP-1s to meaningfully eat into its earnings, at least not in the near-term.",
      "For one, McDonald's core customer base consists of low- and middle-income consumers who are unlikely to be able to afford GLP-1 drugs, said Saleh, who doesn't foresee there being much overlap between the fast food giant's patrons and adopters of the drugs.",
      "\"I don't think there would be a meaningful GLP-1 impact on McDonald's right now, but that's not to say that in three or four years that won't be the case,\" he said. \"I just don't think we are there yet.\"",

      "The website also includes a link to \"Mike Lindell Legal Defense Fund,\" which asks for donations of between $10 to $1,000. The fundraising effort notes that Lindell has spent \"nearly all his resources ... to exposing corruption in our election systems.\"",
      "MyPillow didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "The sales and fundraising efforts come after Lindell told CBS MoneyWatch in 2023 that he had $10,000 to his name after spending millions of his own funds on proving his election theories. The businessman also said he had lost about $7 million after Walmart and other big-box stores dropped his line of bedding.",
      "\"I urgently need your financial support to cover the massive expenses\" of the trial, Lindell said in a video posted to the legal defense site.",

He denied making any statements he knew to be false about Eric Coomer, the former Dominion executive who sued Lindell in 2022 over his statements.",

      "During his testimony, Lindell noted that he once had a net worth of $60 million, but is now millions of dollars in debt, prompting him to turn to crowdfunding to raise money for his legal costs. He also noted that MyPillow had liquidated inventory \"because we had no money left.\"",

      "Apple kicked off its annual Worldwide Developers Conference on Monday with an array of announcements on new features coming this fall via iOS 26, its latest operating system upgrade. Leading the pack is a new user interface enhancement called Liquid Glass.",
      "CEO Tim Cook and other Apple executives used words like \"beautiful,\" \"gorgeous\" and \"delightful\" to describe changes on the horizon for its devices. And while they emphasized a fresh user interface and elevated app features, they also reassured users that the tools would remain familiar and accessible.",
      "Read on for details on the latest bells and whistles coming to Apple's user interface.",
      "iOS 26, iPadOS 26, macOS Tahoe 26",
      "Apple is adopting a new nomenclature for identifying its operating systems, one that is more straightforward than its previous numbering system. Rather than iOS 19, Apple's next iPhone iOS will be called iOS 26 to align with the upcoming year. iOS 26, along with iPadOS 26, macOS Tahoe 26, watchOS 26, and tvOS 261 are slated to be released as free updates in September 2025.",
      "In addition to new design elements detailed below, iOS 26 will elevate the capabilities of existing apps including Facetime, Photos, Safari and Carplay.",

      "Apple is also making changes to its messages app. Texters with iOS 26 will be able to change the background, or wallpaper, of a chat conversation. The feature is similar to the \"chat theme\" setting on WhatsApp but with more options. In group chats, dots will appear to indicate who is typing \u2014 something previously reserved for one-on-one chats. Texters will also be able create and share polls directly in group messages.",
      "Filtering texts and calls will also become a lot easier with a new screening feature.",
      "\"Unknown senders appear in a dedicated area where you can decide if you want to mark the number as known, ask for more information or delete until you accept messages from unknown senders will remain silenced and won't appear as notifications,\" said Darin Adler, a vice president at Apple.",
      "When you receive a call from an unknown number, Apple will answer the phone silently, record the caller's name and the reason for their call, and then put their response into a written message for the owner of the phone so they can decide whether they want to actually pick up.",

      "A hallmark feature of the new OS is\u00a0Liquid Glass, described by the company as an \"expressive material\" meant to mimic the qualities of glass. The dynamic new interface make apps, widgets and docs appear translucent, allowing users to see multiple layers of their screen at once.",
      "Liquid Glass also creates more movement on your interface by morphing into your display. For example, as messages pop up on your home screen, the time display starts to shrink to accommodate them. The color of Liquid Glass also shifts depending on the content on your screen and adapts between light and dark environments.",
      "\"From navigating apps to system experiences like the lock screen notifications and control center app icons have been crafted with multiple layers of Liquid Glass and come to life in light mode, dark mode, colorful, new tints, or an all new clear look,\" said Dye during the company's keynote Monday.",

      "Apple also delivered long-awaited updates to Apple Intelligence, the company's artificial intelligence system that's now integrated with ChatGPT. AI-powered features arriving this fall include Live Translation, which automatically translates messages as they're being received.",
      "\"So if you're making plans with some new friends while studying abroad, your message can be translated as you type and delivered in their preferred language, and when they respond, each text can be instantly translated for you,\" said Leslie Ikemoto, an engineering director at Apple said at the conference Monday.",
      "Visual Intelligence, another AI tool, allows users to take a screenshot of an image they see online \u2014 say, a cute sweater they come across on one of their apps \u2014 and then look up where to find a similar design online. They can also ask ChatGPT specific questions about the image, such as, keeping with the example of the sweater, \"What material is this made of?\"",
      "Another feature builds on Apple broad selection of emojis by giving users the power to combine and personalize existing emojis to create their own unique expressions. In their presentation, Apple showed how someone could merge the lightbulb emoji with the sloth emoji to indicate they were the last one to get a joke, for example.",
      "Still lingering on Apple's to do list is new AI integrations for Siri. Apple introduced updates to the voice assistant at last year's conference, but the full suite of upgrades for the voice assistant have yet to take effect. \"We're continuing our work to deliver the features that make Siri even more personal,\" said senior vice president of software engineering Craig Federighi on Monday. \"This work needed more time to reach our high quality bar, and we look forward to sharing more about it in the coming year.\"",

    "summary": "GOP Sen. Josh Hawley's position on the minimum wage aligns him with some of the Senate's most liberal members.",
    "story": [
      "Missouri GOP Sen. Josh Hawley plans to introduce legislation Tuesday to raise the federal minimum wage to $15 per hour \u2014 a position that aligns one of the most conservative Republican lawmakers on Capitol Hill with some of the most liberal members of Congress.",
      "The legislation, called the \"Higher Wages for American Workers Act,\" would raise the federal standard starting in 2026 and would also call for an increase in subsequent years to match inflation, CBS News has exclusively learned. Vermont Democratic Sen. Peter Welch has signed on as a co-sponsor.",
      "\"For decades, working Americans have seen their wages flatline. One major culprit of this is the failure of the federal minimum wage to keep up with the economic reality facing hard-working Americans every day,\" Hawley said in a statement to CBS News. \"This bipartisan legislation would ensure that workers across America benefit from higher wages.\"",
      "\"We're in the midst of a severe affordability crisis, with families in red and blue states alike struggling to afford necessities like housing and groceries,\" Welch said in a statement to CBS News. \"A stagnant federal minimum wage only adds fuel to the fire. Every hard-working American deserves a living wage that helps put a roof over their head and food on the table \u2014 $7.25 an hour doesn't even come close.\"",
      "The federal minimum wage currently sits at $7.25 per hour and has not risen since 2009, according to the U.S. Department of Labor.",
      "The move by Hawley puts him at odds with conservative party orthodoxy, which has traditionally opposed a federal minimum wage increase on the grounds that it would be costly for businesses and ultimately, for consumers. But Hawley's pitch is reflective of the party's realignment in the Trump era, where the president's brand of populism has fueled a shift among working-class voters away from Democrats and toward Republicans.",
      "Hawley has been pushing Republicans to embrace this shift. The minimum wage legislation is part of a broader, aspirational package of legislative proposals he dubbed the \"Pro-Worker Framework for the 119th Congress.\" This includes a proposal to help strengthen protections for union jobs, as well as for organizing and collective bargaining.",
      "Earlier this year, he teamed up with Sen. Bernie Sanders to introduce legislation to cap credit card interest rates at 10%. And in the last Congress, he introduced legislation that would require companies with revenues of $1 billion or more to pay their employees at least $15 per hour. In recent weeks, Hawley has been urging his party against cuts to Medicaid benefits in the budget reconciliation bill.",
      "In November, voters in Hawley's home state of Missouri approved a ballot measure to raise the state's minimum wage to $15 per hour, starting in 2026. But the Legislature repealed part of the law that would allow later increases to adjust for inflation.",
      "Earlier this year, President Trump rescinded a Biden-era executive order that raised the minimum wage for federal contractors to $17.75 per hour. At his Senate confirmation hearing in January, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said he does not support raising the federal minimum wage, arguing that it is a decision best left up to the states.",

    "published": "Tue, 10 Jun 2025 09:28:03 -0400",
    "summary": "A \"sneaky\" invasive species that has a potentially deadly sting can be found in more than a dozen states, according to experts.",
    "story": [
      "The Joro spider, Asian long-horned beetle and spotted lanternfly have company this summer.",
      "A \"sneaky\" invasive species that has a potentially deadly sting continues to spread across the U.S. and can be found in more than a dozen states, according to experts.",
      "Asian needle ants were first detected in the U.S. almost a century ago, but the species has continued to expand its reach, primarily throughout the Southeast, and this pest could potentially be deadly to humans, according to Dan Suiter, a professor of urban entomology at the University of Georgia.",
      "\"It injects venom that can harm you. Its sting can be life threatening,\" Suiter recently told the university.",
      "Suiter added that people who have adverse reactions to bee and ant stings are especially vulnerable and could go into anaphylactic shock from the needle ant's sting. Anaphylaxis is a potentially life-threatening allergic reaction that can occur within seconds of being exposed to something you're allergic to, such as a sting, according to the Mayo Clinic.",
      "\"If you suffer from anaphylaxis, you should really know what this ant looks like,\" Suiter says. \"And it might be smart to carry an EpiPen.\"",
      "Suiter urged people to be vigilant for these invasive species, especially with ant populations peaking later this summer.",
      "What are Asian needle ants?",
      "Asian needle ants are technically known as Brachyponera chinensis\u00a0\u2014 roughly translated as \"short, wicked ant from China\" \u2014 but their native range also includes Japan and the Koreas, according to the U.S. Forest Service.",
      "The insect was first discovered in the U.S. in 1932 in Georgia, but has only recently started to \"cause problems in North America after being relatively unnoticed for many years,\" the U.S. Forest Service says.",
      "The pest has now been detected all the way from Washington state to Florida, according to the site\u00a0antmaps.org as well as Mississippi State University, and the ant is recently getting more attention in Texas.",
      "Suiter says Asian needle ants are \"sneaky\" because they are less than a quarter of an inch long and are adept at hiding.",
      "\"Unlike many invasive species that tend to colonize areas in the wake of natural or human disturbance, Asian needle ants are capable of invading undisturbed forest areas where they nest under and within logs and other debris, under stones, and in leaf litter,\" the U.S. Forest Service says.",
      "Environmental impacts",
      "According to Suiter, Asian needle ants wreak havoc in native environments.",
      "\"They outcompete other ant species that are important to the ecology of that area,\" he says.",
      "Asian needle ants prey on other insects and are capable of displacing ant species that are critical for seed dispersal, according to the U.S. Forest Service. Researchers have documented large decreases in seed dispersal in forests where Asian needle ants are present.",
      "\"Thus, this invasive species could have dramatic, long-term negative effects on forest understory,\" the service says.",
      "What should people do if they see Asian needle ants?",
      "Asian needle ants are about 0.2 inches in length, and dark brown or black with the end of the antennae and the legs being a lighter orange-brown, the U.S. Forest Service says. Other ant species can look similar, \"so it takes an experienced eye to positively identify them,\" the service says.",
      "Suiter says that you can send a photograph or a specimen to a local University of Georgia Extension office, which can help with identification. The public can also contact a professional to come out and bait for the ants, he says.",
      "The U.S. Forest Service advises people to avoid the pest and to be especially vigilant in areas with logs, rotting wood or rocks where the ants can nest.",
      "\"Unfortunately, as with many invasive species, it appears Asian needle ants are here to stay,\" the service says.",

    "summary": "A private lunar lander from Tokyo-based company ispace was aiming for a touchdown in the unexplored far north with a mini rover.",
    "story": [
      "Four-and-a-half months after launch atop a Falcon 9 rocket, a privately-built Japanese lander attempted to touch down on the moon Thursday, but telemetry indicated a higher-than-expected descent velocity moments before communications were lost. The data suggested a mission-ending crash landing.",
      "\"Based on the currently available data, the Mission Control Center has been able to confirm the following: The laser rangefinder used to measure the distance to the lunar surface experienced delays in obtaining valid measurement values,\" ispace, builder of the Resilience lander, said in a statement.",
      "\"As a result, the lander was unable to decelerate sufficiently to reach the required speed for the planned lunar landing. Based on these circumstances, it is currently assumed that the lander likely performed a hard landing on the lunar surface.\"",
      "After unsuccessful attempts to re-establish communications, flight controllers in Tokyo uplinked commands to reboot the Resilience lander's flight computer. But there was no response.",
      "\"Given that there is currently no prospect of a successful lunar landing, our top priority is to swiftly analyze the telemetry data we have obtained thus far and work diligently to identify the cause,\" said ispace founder and CEO Takeshi Hakamada.",
      "\"We will strive to restore trust by providing a report of the findings to our shareholders, payload customers, (mission) partners, government officials and all supporters of ispace.\"",
      "The landing attempt came two years after ispace's first lander malfunctioned during the final stages of its descent to the moon, making a similar hard landing. But Hakamada said it was too early to establish any common cause and that engineers needed more time to analyze the telemetry that made it back to Earth.",
      "Carrying cameras, a few science payloads, a tiny rover and even an art project, Resilience   fired its thrusters just after 2:10 p.m. EDT to begin the 66-minute descent from a 62-mile-high circular orbit to touchdown near the center of Mare Frigoris \u2014 the Sea of Cold \u2014 in the moon's northern hemisphere at 60 degrees north latitude.",
      "All appeared to be going smoothly when, around 3:17 p.m. \u2014 the projected landing time \u2014 telemetry suddenly ceased. The last data received indicated a higher-than-expected descent velocity and an altitude of 630 feet above the surface.",
      "\"At this moment, we have not yet been able to establish communication with Resilience, but ispace engineers in our Mission Control Center are continuing to work to contact the lander,\" the company posted on X just after 5 p.m.",
      "\"We will share an update with the latest information in a media announcement in the next few hours. Thank you for your patience -- please check back with us soon.\" Three hours later, officials announced the landing failure during a news briefing.",
      "The primary goals of the mission were to land on the moon and deploy the small micro rover Tenacious. The rover, in turn, carried the art project, a tiny model of a Swedish house, designed by artist Mikael Genberg. The traditionally styled red-and-white house measures just 4.7 inches long, 4 inches high and weighs just 3.5 ounces.",
      "Asked why he took on the project, which required years of planning, fundraising and engineering, Genberg said \"we have done as human beings things from time to time that (do not) seemingly have a purpose beyond just being creative.\"",
      "\"The Eiffel Tower, for instance, I mean it's a stupid thing to build,\" he said. \"Today, it has a purpose as maybe the most important thing to make Paris the most visited city in the world.\"",
      "While the \"moonhouse\" could survive for thousands if not millions of years in the airless environment of the moon, its custom paint was expected to fade in the sun's harsh radiation, and lunar dust will slowly coat its surface. Genberg joked that he would happily await an invitation to repaint it.",
      "Ispace is one of a handful of companies attempting to provide non-government transportation services to the moon for a variety of payloads ranging from science instruments to technology demonstrations.",
      "But as it turns out, getting low-cost spacecraft to the moon's surface is extremely difficult.",
      "Ispace tried and\u00a0failed in 2023\u00a0when its first lander ran out of propellant nearing the surface, dropping to a \"hard\" crash landing. Pittsburgh-based Astrobotic Technology launched its\u00a0Peregrine lander in January 2024, but the spacecraft suffered a propulsion system leak and never made it to the moon.",
      "Houston-based Intuitive Machines successfully put two landers down on the lunar surface\u00a0in 2024, and again\u00a0earlier this year, but both spacecraft tipped over on touchdown. While each one survived its landing, neither was able to accomplish all of its pre-flight objectives.",
      "Before Thursday, only Firefly Aerospace had successfully touched down and carried out its mission, landing the\u00a0Blue Ghost spacecraft on March 2, 53 years after the final Apollo mission.",
      "Resilience and Blue Ghost\u00a0were launched atop a single SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket on Jan. 15. The Blue Ghost lander took a direct route to the moon and carried out a successful touchdown, operating for a full two-week lunar \"day.\"",
      "Resilience followed a longer, low-energy trajectory that carried it well past its target, using the moon's gravity to bring it back to an initially elliptical orbit and finally, using its thrusters, to the 62-mile circular orbit that set the stage for descent.",

      "\"At this moment, we have not yet been able to establish communication with Resilience, but ispace engineers in our Mission Control Center are continuing to work to contact the lander,\" the company posted on X just after 5 p.m.",
      "\"We will share an update with the latest information in a media announcement in the next few hours. Thank you for your patience -- please check back with us soon.\" Three hours later, officials announced the landing failure during a news briefing.",
      "The primary goals of the mission were to land on the moon and deploy the small micro rover Tenacious. The rover, in turn, carried the art project, a tiny model of a Swedish house, designed by artist Mikael Genberg. The traditionally styled red-and-white house measures just 4.7 inches long, 4 inches high and weighs just 3.5 ounces.",
      "Asked why he took on the project, which required years of planning, fundraising and engineering, Genberg said \"we have done as human beings things from time to time that (do not) seemingly have a purpose beyond just being creative.\"",
      "\"The Eiffel Tower, for instance, I mean it's a stupid thing to build,\" he said. \"Today, it has a purpose as maybe the most important thing to make Paris the most visited city in the world.\"",
      "While the \"moonhouse\" could survive for thousands if not millions of years in the airless environment of the moon, its custom paint was expected to fade in the sun's harsh radiation, and lunar dust will slowly coat its surface. Genberg joked that he would happily await an invitation to repaint it.",
      "Ispace is one of a handful of companies attempting to provide non-government transportation services to the moon for a variety of payloads ranging from science instruments to technology demonstrations.",
      "But as it turns out, getting low-cost spacecraft to the moon's surface is extremely difficult.",
      "Ispace tried and\u00a0failed in 2023\u00a0when its first lander ran out of propellant nearing the surface, dropping to a \"hard\" crash landing. Pittsburgh-based Astrobotic Technology launched its\u00a0Peregrine lander in January 2024, but the spacecraft suffered a propulsion system leak and never made it to the moon.",
      "Houston-based Intuitive Machines successfully put two landers down on the lunar surface\u00a0in 2024, and again\u00a0earlier this year, but both spacecraft tipped over on touchdown. While each one survived its landing, neither was able to accomplish all of its pre-flight objectives.",
      "Before Thursday, only Firefly Aerospace had successfully touched down and carried out its mission, landing the\u00a0Blue Ghost spacecraft on March 2, 53 years after the final Apollo mission.",
      "Resilience and Blue Ghost\u00a0were launched atop a single SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket on Jan. 15. The Blue Ghost lander took a direct route to the moon and carried out a successful touchdown, operating for a full two-week lunar \"day.\"",
      "Resilience followed a longer, low-energy trajectory that carried it well past its target, using the moon's gravity to bring it back to an initially elliptical orbit and finally, using its thrusters, to the 62-mile circular orbit that set the stage for descent.",

    "story": [
      "The 2025 Tribeca Festival continues this week with movie screenings, Q&As, industry panel discussions and public performances across New York City. But one program in this year's festival takes place in virtual worlds.",
      "For more than a decade, Tribeca has been expanding its focus beyond cinema and television to include new avenues of storytelling through the use of virtual reality, augmented reality, and other nascent technologies, producing some vivid immersive displays. Even if the storytelling aspect of the programs were limited, the artistic expressions could be powerful. This was especially true with past exhibits that enveloped the viewer in massive spaces, in which computer-generated imagery or time-lapse photography placed the viewer in new worlds, from exploding galaxies to swirling blood vessels.",
      "Hosted under the umbrella title \"In Search of Us,\"\u00a0this year's installation in Lower Manhattan ties 11 projects together under the rubric of impacts on humanity \u2014 exploring topics from artificial intelligence to climate change, war, school shootings and transphobia. The exhibits with the most profound effects are those with the strongest and most emotional stories embedded inside them.",
      "Within a simple, delineated space furnished with minimal furniture, \"Fragile Home,\" by Ond\u0159ej Moravec and Victoria Lopukhina, uses mixed reality to recreate a home in Ukraine that comes under bombardment. Wearing goggles, the viewer walks through a comfortable, well-appointed living room, past a dinner table and a purring cat, and looks outside the window to a peaceful vista \u2014 all of which, in a flash, is replaced by the home's bombed-out remains, vandalized with Russian forces' \"Z\" graffiti.",
      "The sense of violation is made so powerful in so simple a setting \u2014 and the recognition that such destruction is multiplied millions of times over is heart-wrenching. But the objects that survived \u2014 those with personal meaning to just a handful of people \u2013 become representations of resilience to many.",
      "\"Scent,\" by Alan Kwan, is a first-person cinematic game in which the player becomes a dog wandering a landscape, who observes people being attacked and killed by malevolent forces. In between avoiding bombs and gunfire, the dog helps guide the souls of those killed to become reincarnated. It's a meditative view of cruel violations impacting humanity and nature.",
      "Armed with a tablet, viewers of the augmented reality \"There Goes Nikki\" can wander a garden populated by virtual flowers, and a visualization of the late poet Nikki Giovanni reciting her poem, \"Quilting the Black-eyed Pea (We're going to Mars).\" By Idris Brewster, Michele Stephenson and Joe Brewster.",
      "How dangerous is artificial intelligence? How dumb is it? How snarky?\u00a0 \"AI & Me: The Confessional and AI Ego,\" directed by Daniela Nedovescu and Octavian Mot, provides viewers with an opportunity to become test subjects, as it were, to AI's judgmental streak. Upon sitting in a chair, the participant is captured on camera and analyzed by AI, which conjures up your name, personality traits, and goals. How close are they to reality? Prepare to get snarked. But if the AI program \"likes\" you? Your AI-altered image will turn up in its pantheon of favored carbon-based units (pictured above, right).",
      "Other exhibits are immersive representations of culture \u2014 some self-generated, some created by AI.",
      "\"Uncharted\" (VR, by Kidus Hailesilassie) combines footage of a dancer with spoken word and visualizations of symbols to become a rapturous demonstration of pan-African language and storytelling.",
      "The interactive \"New Maqam City,\" by MIPSTERZ, allows you to become a DJ, manipulating drum beat patterns recognizable in Muslim communities around the world to create a transcendent vibe.",
      "\"The Innocence of Unknowing\" is a video essay and AI project studying media coverage of mass shootings, projected within a simulated classroom. (Created by Ryat Yezbick and Milo Talwani through the MIT Open Documentary Lab.)",
      "One of the strongest impacts of any installation was made by \"In the Current of Being,\" by Cameron Kostopoulos. Using haptic VR, the viewer is literally strapped into a chair; electrodes are attached to your fingertips, arms, and torso, along with VR goggles. Interesting, you think. Then, the presentation begins, recounting the true story of a survivor of electroshock conversion therapy. (As a teenager, Carolyn Mercer had been \"treated\" with electrical shocks in an attempt to \"cure\" her from becoming trans.) As images of female beauty are flashed before you, electrical impulses throb across your body. This is not virtual reality; the extreme discomfort is very real, forcing me out of the presentation less than halfway through. The upshot: aversion therapy works, because I will never allow VR electrodes to be attached to my body ever again.",
      "Beyond the confines of\u00a0 the exhibition space at 161 Water Street, the two-part \"The Power Loom and The Founders Pillars\" (by Lesiba Mabitsela, Meghna Singh and Simon Wood) includes a site-specific AR experience, visible on a mobile app six blocks away, at the New York Stock Exchange, creating a memorial to enslaved people once sold at the Wall Street Slave Market, established in the 18th century.",

    "summary": "There is a slight catch to keep in mind: These new iOS26 features will be reserved for iPhone 11 and later models.",
    "story": [
      "Apple kicked off its annual Worldwide Developers Conference on Monday with an array of announcements on new features coming this fall via iOS 26, its latest operating system upgrade. Leading the pack is a new user interface enhancement called Liquid Glass.",
      "CEO Tim Cook and other Apple executives used words like \"beautiful,\" \"gorgeous\" and \"delightful\" to describe changes on the horizon for its devices. And while they emphasized a fresh user interface and elevated app features, they also reassured users that the tools would remain familiar and accessible.",
      "Read on for details on the latest bells and whistles coming to Apple's user interface.",
      "iOS 26, iPadOS 26, macOS Tahoe 26",
      "Apple is adopting a new nomenclature for identifying its operating systems, one that is more straightforward than its previous numbering system. Rather than iOS 19, Apple's next iPhone iOS will be called iOS 26 to align with the upcoming year. iOS 26, along with iPadOS 26, macOS Tahoe 26, watchOS 26, and tvOS 261 are slated to be released as free updates in September 2025.",
      "In addition to new design elements detailed below, iOS 26 will elevate the capabilities of existing apps including Facetime, Photos, Safari and Carplay.",
      "There's also a splashy update to iPhone photo display: With iOS 26, users will\u00a0 be able to view pictures in 3D across the Photos app, lock screen and home screen.",
      "Apple is also making changes to its messages app. Texters with iOS 26 will be able to change the background, or wallpaper, of a chat conversation. The feature is similar to the \"chat theme\" setting on WhatsApp but with more options. In group chats, dots will appear to indicate who is typing \u2014 something previously reserved for one-on-one chats. Texters will also be able create and share polls directly in group messages.",
      "Filtering texts and calls will also become a lot easier with a new screening feature.",
      "\"Unknown senders appear in a dedicated area where you can decide if you want to mark the number as known, ask for more information or delete until you accept messages from unknown senders will remain silenced and won't appear as notifications,\" said Darin Adler, a vice president at Apple.",
      "When you receive a call from an unknown number, Apple will answer the phone silently, record the caller's name and the reason for their call, and then put their response into a written message for the owner of the phone so they can decide whether they want to actually pick up.",
      "There is a slight catch to keep in mind: These new iOS26 features will be reserved for iPhone 11 and later models.",
      "Design upgrades, including Liquid Glass",
      "Alan Dye, Apple's vice president of human interface design, calls the new OS, the company's \u00a0\"broadest design update ever.\"",
      "A hallmark feature of the new OS is\u00a0Liquid Glass, described by the company as an \"expressive material\" meant to mimic the qualities of glass. The dynamic new interface make apps, widgets and docs appear translucent, allowing users to see multiple layers of their screen at once.",
      "Liquid Glass also creates more movement on your interface by morphing into your display. For example, as messages pop up on your home screen, the time display starts to shrink to accommodate them. The color of Liquid Glass also shifts depending on the content on your screen and adapts between light and dark environments.",
      "\"From navigating apps to system experiences like the lock screen notifications and control center app icons have been crafted with multiple layers of Liquid Glass and come to life in light mode, dark mode, colorful, new tints, or an all new clear look,\" said Dye during the company's keynote Monday.",
      "Apple Intelligence",
      "Apple also delivered long-awaited updates to Apple Intelligence, the company's artificial intelligence system that's now integrated with ChatGPT. AI-powered features arriving this fall include Live Translation, which automatically translates messages as they're being received.",
      "\"So if you're making plans with some new friends while studying abroad, your message can be translated as you type and delivered in their preferred language, and when they respond, each text can be instantly translated for you,\" said Leslie Ikemoto, an engineering director at Apple said at the conference Monday.",
      "Visual Intelligence, another AI tool, allows users to take a screenshot of an image they see online \u2014 say, a cute sweater they come across on one of their apps \u2014 and then look up where to find a similar design online. They can also ask ChatGPT specific questions about the image, such as, keeping with the example of the sweater, \"What material is this made of?\"",
      "Another feature builds on Apple broad selection of emojis by giving users the power to combine and personalize existing emojis to create their own unique expressions. In their presentation, Apple showed how someone could merge the lightbulb emoji with the sloth emoji to indicate they were the last one to get a joke, for example.",
      "Still lingering on Apple's to do list is new AI integrations for Siri. Apple introduced updates to the voice assistant at last year's conference, but the full suite of upgrades for the voice assistant have yet to take effect. \"We're continuing our work to deliver the features that make Siri even more personal,\" said senior vice president of software engineering Craig Federighi on Monday. \"This work needed more time to reach our high quality bar, and we look forward to sharing more about it in the coming year.\"",
      "In a research note, Wedbush tech analyst Dan Ives noted that the Apple Intelligence rollout has been slower than expected, but also estimates that over the next few years, 25% of the world population will access AI through an Apple-powered device.",
      "\"While many on [Wall] Street are heading into WWDC as underwhelming given the slower-than-expected rollout of Apple Intelligence, we disagree with this bearish narrative and strongly believe this will be the start of AI monetization period of the Apple ecosystem as the company will continue to lay the foundation through its new operating system updates across Mac, iOS, iPad and others with its '26\" update,'\" Ives said.",

    "story": [
      "New college graduates this year face an especially daunting task \u2014 putting their degrees to work just as \"generative\" artificial intelligence technology like ChatGPT is beginning to change the American workplace.",
      "\"We are entering an entirely new economy, so the knowledge economy that we have been in for the last 50 years or so is on the way out, and a new economy is on the way in,\" Aneesh Raman, Chief Economic Opportunity Officer at LinkedIn, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "The impact of AI on Americans recently out of college is already visible across a range of industries and jobs, from technology and finance to media, legal fields and market research. As a result, for the first time\u00a0unemployment among fresh grads recently surpassed the nation's overall jobless rate \u2014 a shift some experts attribute in part to the creeping influence of AI.",
      "\"There are signs that entry-level positions are being displaced by artificial intelligence at higher rates than the roles above them,\" said Matthew Martin, senior U.S. economist at Oxford Economics.",
      "With the adoption of AI at work only expected to accelerate, we asked three experts across academia, recruitment and consulting for advice on how new college grads should navigate this new normal. Here's what they said.",
      "Become fluent in AI",
      "Perhaps most important, young job-seekers start using gen-AI tools \u2014 today.",
      "\"Almost anybody in that audience, irrespective of the job that they're pursuing, will be expected to use AI with some facility right away,\" said Joseph Fuller, a professor at Harvard Business School and founder of the Managing the Future of Work\u00a0project, comparing the task to learning how to use Microsoft Office for a previous generation of grads.",
      "To get the ball rolling, experts encourage those who are starting to hunt for work to familiarize themselves with the array of tools at their disposal, such as Anthropic's Claude or OpenAI's ChatGPT. That means learning how to engage with such tools beyond simply using them as a search engine.",
      "\"You want to get in a dialogue with it,\" Fuller said. \"You want to ask it to take different perspectives.\"",
      "Emily Rose McRae, an analyst at research and advisory firm Gartner, said learning how to use AI apps can also be a good way to develop transferable skills. For example, asking AI to summarize documents and then validating its findings to ensure accuracy.",
      "Meanwhile, although AI can be helpful when it comes time to filling out job applications, users should proceed with caution given that recruiters can often spot AI-generated language, experts note. Nearly two-thirds of job candidates today use AI at some point in the application process, according to a\u00a0report from recruitment firm Career Group Companies.",
      "\"If you're using it to write your cover letter and your resume and you did not review it, everyone can tell,\" McRae said.",
      "Another way to gain potentially valuable experience with AI, while also seeking work, is for interview practice. For example, users can ask the chatbot both to provide sample questions they might face in an interview and then rate the quality of their responses.",
      "\"If you are using it as a tool to get your own understanding of self in interviews, you're going to start being leaps ahead of everyone else,\" Raman said.",
      "Hone your soft skills",
      "Experts say that as AI surpasses humans in executing certain tasks \u2014 think actuarial math or corporate compliance, for example \u2014more attention will shift to job candidates' so-called soft skills, such as problem solving and communication.",
      "\"You cannot outsource your thinking to AI,\" LinkedIn's Raman said. \"You have to continue to hone critical thinking and complex strategy thinking.\"",
      "The focus will be less on your pedigree \u2014 where you went to school or even whether you have a college degree \u2014 he added, and more on what he calls the \"5 Cs\": curiosity, compassion, creativity, courage and communication.",
      "To improve their soft skills, Fuller encourages entry-level job candidates to work on turning what they regard as their biggest weakness into a strength. For instance, if you typically shy away from public speaking or talking in groups, push yourself to get comfortable in those situations.",
      "\"The inability to do that is going to be penalized more severely in the work of the future than it has been in the past,\" he said.",
      "The Harvard professor also suggested highlighting examples of advanced social skills directly on your resume to help paint a picture for recruiters of how you can contribute to the workplace.",
      "Choose your employer wisely",
      "Beyond skills development, experts say college grads should be thoughtful about the type of company they choose to work at, knowing that AI could drastically alter the business in the coming years.",
      "\"The most important thing, if you're a new grad, is where you work \u2014 not what you do at the place you're going to work,\" Raman told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "He encouraged college graduates to seek out employers that are integrating AI responsibly and with respect for their workforce \u2014 as opposed to embracing it chiefly to replace people. Companies that are adapting to what is a major technological shift in real time will typically offer the best opportunities for learning and growth, Fuller said.",
      "In evaluating a prospective employer, young job candidates should try to gain an understanding of how they fit into the company's future. For example, McRae recommends asking hiring managers up front what types of investments the organization is making in its employees and what the room for growth looks like.",
      "\"What are they telling me they care about? What do career paths look like for this role like now? How do you help people develop the skills they need to become experts?\" she said.",
      "In researching companies, McRae also encouraged recent college grads to look for places that offer apprenticeship or rotational programs, which can offer ways to quickly ramp up their knowledge base, especially if traditional entry-level roles are in short supply.",

      "\"We have strict rules against non-consensual intimate imagery; we removed these ads, deleted the Pages responsible for running them and permanently blocked the URLs associated with these apps,\" a Meta spokesperson told CBS News in an emailed statement.",
      "CBS News uncovered dozens of those ads on Meta's Instagram platform, in its \"Stories\" feature, promoting AI tools that, in many cases, advertised the ability to \"upload a photo\" and \"see anyone naked.\" Other ads in Instagram's Stories promoted the ability to upload and manipulate videos of real people. One promotional ad even read \"how is this filter even allowed?\" as text underneath an example of a nude deepfake.",
      "One ad promoted its AI product by using highly sexualized, underwear-clad deepfake images of actors Scarlett Johansson and Anne Hathaway. Some of the ads' URL links redirect to websites that promote the ability to animate real people's images and get them to perform sex acts. And some of the applications charged users between $20 and $80 to access these \"exclusive\" and \"advance\" features. In other cases, an ad's URL redirected users to Apple's app store, where \"nudify\" apps were available to download.",
      "An analysis of the advertisements in Meta's ad library found that there were, at a minimum, hundreds of these ads available across the company's social media platforms, including on Facebook, Instagram, Threads, the Facebook Messenger application and Meta Audience Network \u2014 a platform that allows Meta advertisers to reach users on mobile apps and websites that partner with the company.",
      "According to Meta's own Ad Library data, many of these ads were specifically targeted at men between the ages of 18 and 65, and were active in the United States, European Union and United Kingdom.",
      "A Meta spokesperson told CBS News the spread of this sort of AI-generated content is an ongoing problem and they are facing increasingly sophisticated challenges in trying to combat it.",
      "\"The people behind these exploitative apps constantly evolve their tactics to evade detection, so we're continuously working to strengthen our enforcement,\" a Meta spokesperson said.",
      "CBS News found that ads for \"nudify\" deepfake tools were still available on the company's Instagram platform even after Meta had removed those initially flagged.",
      "Deepfakes are manipulated images, audio recordings, or videos of real people that have been altered with artificial intelligence to misrepresent someone as saying or doing something that the person did not actually say or do.",
      "Last month, President Trump signed into law the bipartisan \"Take It Down Act,\" which, among other things, requires websites and social media companies to remove deepfake content within 48 hours of notice from a victim.",
      "Although the law makes it illegal to \"knowingly publish\" or threaten to publish intimate images without a person's consent, including AI-created deepfakes, it does not target the tools used to create such AI-generated content.",
      "Those tools do violate platform safety and moderation rules implemented by both Apple and Meta on their respective platforms.",
      "Meta's advertising standards policy says, \"ads must not contain adult nudity and sexual activity. This includes nudity, depictions of people in explicit or sexually suggestive positions, or activities that are sexually suggestive.\"",
      "Under Meta's \"bullying and harassment\" policy, the company also prohibits \"derogatory sexualized photoshop or drawings\" on its platforms. The company says its regulations are intended to block users from sharing or threatening to share nonconsensual intimate imagery.",
      "Apple's guidelines for its app store explicitly state that \"content that is offensive, insensitive, upsetting, intended to disgust, in exceptionally poor taste, or just plain creepy\" is banned.",
      "Alexios Mantzarlis, director of the Security, Trust, and Safety Initiative at Cornell University's tech research center, has been studying the surge in AI deepfake networks marketing on social platforms for more than a year. He told CBS News in a phone interview on Tuesday that he'd seen thousands more of these ads across Meta platforms, as well as on platforms such as X and Telegram, during that period.",

      "\"I do think that trust and safety teams at these companies care. I don't think, frankly, that they care at the very top of the company in Meta's case,\" he said. \"They're clearly under-resourcing the teams that have to fight this stuff, because as sophisticated as these [deepfake] networks are \u2026 they don't have Meta money to throw at it.\"",

      "\"The problem with apps is that they have this dual-use front where they present on the app store as a fun way to face swap, but then they are marketing on Meta as their primary purpose being nudification. So when these apps come up for review on the Apple or Google store, they don't necessarily have the wherewithal to ban them,\" he said.",

      "CBS News has reached out to both Apple and Google for comment as to how they moderate their respective platforms. Neither company had responded by the time of writing.",
      "Major tech companies' promotion of such apps raises serious questions about both user consent and about online safety for minors. A CBS News analysis of one \"nudify\" website promoted on Instagram showed that the site did not prompt any form of age verification prior to a user uploading a photo to generate a deepfake image.",
      "Such issues are widespread. In December, CBS News' 60 Minutes reported on the lack of age verification on one of the most popular sites using artificial intelligence to generate fake nude photos of real people.",
      "Despite visitors being told that they must be 18 or older to use the site, and that \"processing of minors is impossible,\" 60 Minutes was able to immediately gain access to uploading photos once the user clicked \"accept\" on the age warning prompt, with no other age verification necessary.",
      "Data also shows that a high percentage of underage teenagers have interacted with deepfake content. A March 2025 study conducted by the children's protection nonprofit Thorn showed that among teens, 41% said they had heard of the term \"deepfake nudes,\" while 10% reported personally knowing someone who had had deepfake nude imagery created of them.",

    "story": [
      "The wide-reaching tariffs imposed by President Trump on virtually every country can remain in place until at least the end of July, an appellate court said Tuesday evening.",
      "The Federal Circuit Court of Appeals granted the Trump administration's request to pause a lower court ruling that blocked the tariffs pending appeal. The appellate judges scheduled oral arguments in the case on July 31, meaning the tariffs are set to stay in effect until then unless there's further court action in the case.",
      "The U.S. Court of International Trade ruled last month that many of Mr. Trump's signature tariffs are illegal, including the 10% tariffs on virtually every U.S. trading partner and a set of tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China. The appellate court quickly paused that ruling from taking effect until further notice \u2014 ahead of Tuesday's longer-lasting pause.",
      "Tuesday's ruling was unsigned and did not include the court's reasoning.",
      "In\u00a0a post on his Truth Social platform Wednesday morning, Mr. Trump said, \"A Federal Appeals Court has just ruled that the United States can use TARIFFS to protect itself against other countries. A great and important win for the U.S.\"",
      "The appellate ruling extends a legal battle over the fate of the tariffs. The president put levies in place on imports from Canada, China and Mexico early in his term, citing the flow of drugs and unauthorized immigration. Then, on a day in early April he dubbed \"Liberation Day,\" Mr. Trump imposed across-the-board 10% tariffs on most countries \u2014 along with much higher \"reciprocal\" tariffs on dozens of trading partners that he accused of unfair trade practices.",
      "Mr. Trump has justified many of those tariffs using a 1977 law that lets the president regulate imports during emergency situations. But a group of businesses and state governments sued, arguing he doesn't have the legal authority. The U.S. Court of International Trade sided with the plaintiffs, concluding that the 1977 law doesn't allow the tariffs \u2014 and even if it did, it would be unconstitutional for a law passed by Congress to give the president blanket power to levy tariffs.",
      "The trade war has rocked markets and drawn criticism from members of both parties, but Mr. Trump has stood by his tariffs, arguing they're necessary to fix trade imbalances and restore U.S. manufacturing.",
      "The 10% tariffs have stayed in place, though the \"reciprocal\" tariffs are largely on hold as the Trump administration seeks to strike trade deals with other countries, and many Canadian and Mexican goods are exempted from the levies on those countries. Chinese goods\u00a0face 30% tariffs \u2014 down from 145% following an agreement between the U.S. and China.",

    "story": [
      "Fox News' Bryan Llenas reports from New York City on Sean 'Diddy' Combs being reprimanded for body language directed at the jury.",
      "Sean \"Diddy\" Combs' ex-girlfriend took the stand Monday and testified for the third day in the rapper's federal trial for sex crimes.",
      "His ex, who testified under the pseudonym \"Jane,\" told prosecutors that there were times she felt coerced into hotel nights with Diddy and that the Bad Boy Records founder still pays for both her legal fees and rent.",
      "Jane recalled alleged instances of abuse while dating Diddy on and off for three years and up until the week before he was arrested in New York City on federal charges.",
      "Jennifer Beidel, a former assistant U.S. Attorney in the Southern District of New York who now practices at Dykema, told Fox News Digital that Jane's testimony may be \"powerful\" to the jury.",

      "Sean \"Diddy\" Combs' ex-girlfriend took the stand Monday and testified for the third day in the rapper's federal trial for sex crimes. (Jane Rosenberg)",
      "\"Jane Doe commented on the consistency between her experience and that of Cassie Ventura after she read Ventura\u2019s civil lawsuit,\" Beidel said. \"If the jury also finds the two women\u2019s experiences similar, Jane Doe\u2019s testimony becomes powerful corroboration of Ventura\u2019s testimony. Adding in the voice memos could lend even more credence to the two women\u2019s accounts, as those voice memos are evidence of Mr. Combs\u2019 views at the time in his own words.\"",
      "Jane told the court that Diddy asked her about coercion after he allegedly forced her to take drugs before having sex with a male escort. She testified about Diddy's alleged violent behavior and said he once put her in a chokehold after kicking and punching her. The jury was shown video evidence of Jane's injuries, which included a bruised eye and welts on her forehead.",
      "Texts shown in federal court on Monday between Diddy and Jane revealed that she felt manipulated and wanted monetary income.",
      "The rapper allegedly texted Jane back, \"F--- you.\" Jane allegedly told Diddy, \"You're the only opportunist ... you had three years of fun with my body ... you were a full time job and consumed my life.\" The \"Last Night\" rapper allegedly texted back that he was blocking Jane's number and also calling the police.",
      "\"You conned me into sucking d--- for you,\" Jane allegedly texted. After several texts, she wrote, \"I'm going to kill myself.\"",
      "Diddy listened to testimony from an ex-girlfriend, who testified under the nickname \"Jane.\" (Jane Rosenberg)",
      "\"Early in the trial, the prosecutors introduced extensive evidence to support their theory that Combs used violence and threats of violence to coerce Ventura into engaging in sexual activity,\" former federal prosecutor Mark Chutkow told Fox News Digital. \"However, the prosecution\u2019s evidence of Jane Doe\u2019s alleged coercion centers more on emotional manipulation than violence.\u00a0That could prove to be a weakness for the prosecution case because Jane\u2019s evidence was introduced later in the trial, closer to when the jurors will deliberate.\"",
      "Mark Chuktow, who now practices at Dykema, added, \"As a result, it might dilute the impact of Ventura\u2019s earlier testimony because Jane\u2019s evidence is less clear-cut regarding whether Combs coerced her to engage in sexual activity.\u00a0To counter this, the prosecutors might put more weight in closing arguments on the evidence that Combs blackmailed both women into complying with his sexual demands through threats of destroying their reputations and careers by publicly exposing the video recordings of their participation in the freak-offs.",
      "\"Blackmail like this might resonate more with the jury than Combs\u2019 emotional manipulation of Jane when deciding whether or not the victims consented to the sexual activity.\"",

      "In court, Jane testified that after fleeing from the \"All About the Benjamins\" rapper during an alleged violent encounter, she returned to the home and claimed she was on the patio when she allegedly punched Diddy around his temple on his forehead. He allegedly retaliated by punching Jane in the head twice in the forehead and eye area.",
      "She told the court she retreated to a deep part of the backyard, fell and curled up in a ball to cover her head and face while Diddy allegedly continued to punch and kick her. He allegedly said Jane was trying to take him away from his kids and family.",
      "Sean \"Diddy\" Combs talks with his lawyers on the 17th day of testimony in his federal trial. (Jane Rosenberg)",
      "Diddy then allegedly grabbed Jane by the hair and her arm and dragged her back into the house, saying she was \"f---ing crazy.\" She claimed to keep asking him to leave.",
      "\"Jane\u2019s testimony is more of the same in regards to the defendant\u2019s conduct, and it certainly does not paint a good picture of Mr. Combs,\" Los Angeles litigator John J. Perlstein told Fox News Digital. \"It is hard to say whether or not the jury is numb to it all. However, they are unlikely to be shocked by Jane\u2019s testimony given what everyone else has said thus far.",
      "\"This trial is a lengthy process for jurors, and recordings and videos of the testimonies typically fare better than readings.\"",
      "Jane also testified to being with Diddy when she saw the video of the rapper assaulting Cassie Ventura at the InterContinental Hotel in 2016. Diddy was with his friends and family in May 2024 when she was invited to a \"huddle,\" where she remembered the group trying to come up with a form of a sincere apology post regarding the video.",
      "CLICK HERE TO GET THE ENTERTAINMENT NEWSLETTER",
      "She told the court that she never heard the \"Victory\" rapper deny he was the one in the video assaulting Cassie. Jane testified that Diddy showed her a final draft of what he would say, and she understood he would post it on social media. She said she thought the message was heartfelt.",
      "Jane claimed they eventually talked about the video in June or July 2024. Diddy allegedly told her that was the only time he and Cassie had physical violence. Diddy allegedly told Jane that Cassie \"was a hitter.\"",
      "WATCH: SEAN \u2018DIDDY\u2019 COMBS ASSAULTS CASSIE VENTURA IN 2016 HOTEL INCIDENT",
      "Attorney Christopher Melche told Fox News Digital, \"Jane testified about horrific acts of abuse in the relationship similar to what Cassie experienced, but what was unique about her testimony today is that Jane is still having her rent paid for by Diddy to this very day, and they continued their relationship right up to the time that he was arrested, so I'm not sure how the jury is going to reconcile all of these horrible things that happened to her and how her rent is being paid and accepted right 'til now.\"",

      "In a federal indictment unsealed on Sept. 17, Diddy was charged with racketeering conspiracy (RICO); sex trafficking by force, fraud or coercion; and transportation to engage in prostitution. If found guilty, he faces a minimum of 15 years behind bars or a maximum sentence of life in prison.",
      "He has maintained his innocence throughout the trial, where witnesses have testified to alleged rape, sexual assault, severe physical abuse, forced labor and drug trafficking. The trial is expected to wrap up by July 4.",

      "How the Atom Touch prosthetic arm uses AI and muscle signals",
      "Atom Bodies' flagship product, Atom Touch, is setting a new standard in prosthetic arms. Unlike traditional prosthetics, which often offer only basic movement and can be uncomfortable to wear, Atom Touch uses EMG (electromyography) sensors placed on the user's skin to detect muscle activity. These signals are then interpreted by machine-learning algorithms, allowing users to control individual fingers, the wrist and the elbow with remarkable precision just by thinking about the movement they want to make.",
      "AI ENABLES PARALYZED MAN TO CONTROL ROBOTIC ARM WITH BRAIN SIGNALS",
      "The arm is powered by the Atom A1, an AI neural interface that can be trained in minutes for intuitive, natural control. The design also includes a load-balanced harness, which distributes weight across the torso, making the device lighter and more comfortable for all-day use.",

      "Atom Touch stands out for several reasons. It is the first prosthetic arm to offer true individual finger movement, which means users can perform tasks like typing, gripping and delicate manipulation with much greater ease. The device uses the Atom A1 AI neural interface, which learns from the user's muscle signals to provide seamless, natural movement. Dozens of sensors in the hand generate haptic feedback, so users can better gauge grip strength and control. With more than 10 motors in the hand alone, Atom Touch offers a near-human range of motion and dexterity. The load-balanced harness system also makes the arm lighter than a human arm and comfortable enough for extended wear, addressing a challenge that many current prosthetics have yet to solve.",

Jason Morris, who lost his arm due to a work accident and is Atom Bodies' lead test user, notes that most prosthetics can only be worn for about two hours due to discomfort. Atom Touch is designed for initial wear of four to six hours, with the goal of achieving all-day use. Atom Bodies has already attracted significant interest, with over 11,000 people on its\u00a0wait list and plans to begin clinical trials within the next year, pending FDA approval.",

      "Apple\u2019s iPad has a strong reputation for security. Thanks to the system architecture of iOS, a non-jailbroken iPad isn\u2019t susceptible to typical viruses or malware infections. However, that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s completely safe from every threat. As with any computer, there are still vulnerabilities that determined hackers can exploit.",
      "iPads are generally secure devices, but it\u2019s still possible for hackers to gain access, so knowing the warning signs of a hacked iPad can help you act quickly to protect your data. Moreover, an iPad often contains a lot of personal information about you and your family, so if it\u2019s ever hacked, it can be quite alarming.",

      "If your iPad suddenly feels more like a sluggish turtle than the speedy device it used to be, that\u2019s a warning sign. When a device is hacked, malicious software might be running in the background, using up memory and processing power. This can make apps slow to open, cause lagging or freezing and even lead to more frequent crashes. You might also notice the battery draining much faster than usual along with the slowdown, since unwanted software can chew through battery life while it secretly runs in the background.",
      "A sudden flood of pop-up ads or strange messages on your iPad screen is a big red flag. Under normal circumstances, iPads should not bombard you with random pop-ups, especially outside of safe apps or websites. If you start seeing lots of unsolicited ads or \"Your iPad is hacked!\" alerts popping up, it could mean an adware program or scam has found its way onto the device. These pop-ups might try to trick you or your kids into clicking links or downloading something harmful, so they\u2019re not just annoying, they\u2019re dangerous signs that something is wrong.",

      "Keep an eye on how the iPad is using the internet. An unusual spike in data usage or constant network activity (even when no one is actively using the iPad) might indicate the device is secretly sending or receiving information without your permission. For example, if your data plan suddenly maxes out or you notice the Wi-Fi icon flickering with activity when the iPad is idle, it could be a sign that a hacker\u2019s software is communicating in the background. Such suspicious network activity is concerning because it suggests someone else might be remotely accessing the iPad or siphoning off personal data.",

      "You might also discover that account details or settings (like your recovery email or trusted phone number) have been altered.

      "1) Reset your passwords: Change your Apple ID password right away (and any other important account passwords used on the iPad) to lock out any intruders. Using a strong password (think long, random and unique to each account) greatly reduces that risk. A password manager can help you generate and store complex passwords so you don\u2019t have to remember them all yourself. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 here.",
      "2) Remove unfamiliar apps: Check the iPad for any apps you or your child didn\u2019t install. If you find an unknown app or a suspicious profile, delete it immediately. This helps eliminate any malicious programs the hacker may have added. To do this, open\u00a0Settings, tap\u00a0General\u00a0>\u00a0iPad Storage, scroll to find the unfamiliar app, tap\u00a0it, then tap\u00a0Delete App and confirm.",
      "3) Update iOS: Make sure the iPad is running the latest version of iPadOS. Apple frequently releases security updates to fix vulnerabilities, so\u00a0updating the software can shut down any loopholes the hacker might have used. Turning on automatic updates is a good idea to stay protected going forward.",
      "4) Enable two-factor authentication: If you haven\u2019t already,\u00a0turn on two-factor authentication for your Apple ID account. This feature adds an extra verification step (like a code sent to your phone) whenever someone tries to sign in, which can stop hackers in their tracks even if they somehow know your password. It\u2019s an excellent safeguard to prevent unauthorized access.",
      "5) Have strong antivirus protection on all devices: Malware, spyware and viruses can run quietly in the background or compromise enough data before it is discovered. While not being hacked in the first place is the best position to be in, it is worse to give access to your iPad\u2019s data to a hacker for a prolonged period of time. That\u2019s why having strong antivirus software running consistently in the background of your device is a great way to prevent compromises from happening in the first place.\u00a0Best antivirus security software and apps to protect you.",

For example, a new iOS update or a heavy app can temporarily slow down your iPad\u2019s performance, so one isolated issue doesn\u2019t always mean you\u2019ve been hacked. However, if you notice multiple warning signs at the same time or anything that just doesn\u2019t feel right, it\u2019s best to act quickly and err on the side of caution.",

      "Glide underwater with CudaJet and make the ocean your playground. Kurt Knutsson discusses the redesigned tech that might be your next big thrilling adventure.",
      "If you've ever dreamed of gliding underwater with the freedom of a dolphin, the CudaJet might be the gadget for you. Unlike most underwater propulsion systems that strap onto your arms or legs, the CudaJet is worn like a backpack, giving you a hands-free way to cruise beneath the surface. It's a fresh approach that feels a lot more natural and comfortable, especially for longer swims.",
      "The CudaJet's story started almost seven years ago. Back then, it was just a prototype called the Cuda, a passion project by British designer Archie O'Brien during his final year at Loughborough College of Art and Design, now known as Loughborough Design School. Archie wanted something lighter and faster than anything else out there, and in 2023 his vision became reality with the first commercial CudaJet.",
      "Now, the CudaJet has been redesigned with a longer battery life, lighter build and updated features, making it even more appealing to underwater adventure seekers.",

      "CudaJet underwater jetpack: How it works and what\u2019s new",
      "So, what's it like to use? The main unit is a dual-jet-drive pack that attaches to a padded neoprene harness, which you wear on your torso. You control everything with a hardwired, trigger-style remote that lets you adjust your speed and keep an eye on the battery level. One of the biggest improvements for 2025 is the battery. While the original model provided approximately 40 minutes of underwater fun for every 75-minute charge, the latest version extends that time to a full 90 minutes per charge. That's more than double the original runtime, so you can explore even more on a single outing.",
      "CudaJet can take you down to a maximum depth of 131 feet, and it delivers about 88 pounds of thrust. That translates to a top speed of roughly 10 feet per second, or about 6.7 mph. Now, that might not sound fast on land, but underwater it's a whole different story. The company likes to point out that at 10 feet per second, the drag force on your body is about the same as flying through air at nearly 200 mph. It's an exhilarating experience that feels powerful and smooth.",
      "The 2025 redesign also trimmed some weight from the original, reducing it from approximately 33 pounds to just over 30 pounds, including the harness. The harness itself comes in four sizes, so you can get a fit that feels just right. Safety is clearly a priority as well. Each CudaJet ships with a factory-set safety depth of about 10 feet, which you can adjust up to the full 131 feet if you're feeling adventurous. If you ever go past your set limit, the motor cuts out and floats you right back to the surface. The controller's full-color display keeps you updated on your speed, battery and depth at all times.",

For those who want something even more exclusive, there's a Founder's Edition with lifetime product access, in-water training with the founder and a lifetime warranty, but only 20 of those are being made.",

    "story": [
      "The CyberGuy explains steps you can take to protect yourself from scams.",
      "Online scams thrive on the urgency and fear of their victims. If you've ever been a victim of a scam, you\u2019d know that bad actors often try to rush you into taking action by creating a sense of fear. A scammer may call you impersonating a government agency and claim your Social Security number has been linked to drug trafficking.",
      "A phishing email might ask you to update your tax details or claim you\u2019ve won a lottery or a free product, all to get you to click a malicious link.",
      "A more effective tactic scammers use is sending fake login alerts. These are warnings that someone has logged into your account, prompting you to take immediate action. This method works well because legitimate services like Google, Apple, Netflix and Facebook also send these types of notifications when someone, including you, logs in from a new device. It can be tricky to tell the difference.",
      "As Robert from Danville asks, \"I constantly get in my spam junk folder emails saying 'someone has logged into your account.' Is this spam? legitimate? concerning? How do I know? How to avoid wasting time checking? How do I check?\"",
      "Join The FREE CyberGuy Report: Get my expert tech tips, critical security alerts and exclusive deals \u2014 plus instant access to my\u00a0free Ultimate Scam Survival Guide when you sign up!",
      "Thanks for writing to us, Robert. I completely understand how tricky it can be to figure out whether these messages are legitimate or just another scam attempt. Let's break down what these urgent warnings usually look like and go over a few ways you can stay safe.",
      "A person logging into a Gmail account on a laptop\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How login alert scams work and why they\u2019re so effective",
      "Scammers often pose as login alerts from Google, Apple, Meta or even your bank, complete with official-looking logos, because fear is effective. But not every alert is a scam. In many cases, these notifications are legitimate and can help you detect unauthorized access to your accounts. Let\u2019s focus on the scam side first.",
      "Login alert scams have been around for a while. Early reports date back to 2021, and the trend has persisted since then. In 2022, reports surfaced that scammers were impersonating Meta and sending phishing emails to users.",
      "FBI WARNS OF SCAM TARGETING VICTIMS WITH FAKE HOSPITALS AND POLICE",
      "One such email used a clean layout with minimal text. It avoided the usual scare tactics and stuck to a simple message. But that is not always the case. A common red flag in phishing attempts is the tendency to overload the email with unnecessary details. These messages often include cluttered formatting, excessive explanations and an increasing number of typos or design errors. One phishing email simply gets to the point:",
      "Someone tried to Iog into Your Account, User lD",
      "A user just logged into your Facebook account from a new device Samsung S21. We are sending you this email to verify it\u2019s really you.",
      "Thanks,",
      "The Facebook Team",
      "What\u2019s concerning now is that poor grammar is no longer a reliable sign of a scam. Thanks to AI, even those with limited English skills can write emails that sound polished and professional. As a result, many phishing messages today read just like legitimate emails from trusted companies.",
      "Receiving a phishing email is not the real issue. The real problem starts when you click on it. Most of these emails contain links that lead to fake login pages, designed to look exactly like platforms such as Facebook, Google or your bank.",
      "If you enter your credentials there, they go directly to the scammer. In some cases, simply clicking the link can trigger a malware download, especially if your browser is outdated or your device lacks proper security. Once inside, attackers can steal personal information, monitor your activity or take control of your accounts.",

      "How to tell if a login alert is real or fake",
      "Real login notifications\u00a0do exist; they\u2019re just much less scary. A genuine alert from Google, Apple or Microsoft will come from an official address (for example, no-reply@accounts.google.com or security@apple.com) and use consistent branding. The tone is factual and helpful.",
      "For instance, a legit Google security alert might say, \"We detected a login from a new sign-in to your Google Account on a Pixel 6 Pro device. If this was you, you don't need to do anything. If not, we'll help you secure your account.\"\u00a0\u00a0It may include a \"Check activity\" button, but that link always redirects to a google.com address, and it won\u2019t prompt you to reenter your password via the email link. Similarly, Apple notes it will never ask for passwords or verification codes via email.",

      "FBI WARNS OF SCAM TARGETING VICTIMS WITH FAKE HOSPITALS AND POLICE",
      "What to do if you get a suspicious login alert email",
      "1. Don\u2019t click any links or attachments and use strong antivirus software: Instead, manually log in to the real site (or open the official app) by typing the URL or using a bookmarked link. This guarantees you\u2019re not walking into a scammer\u2019s trap. The FTC recommends this: if you have an account with that company, contact them via the website or phone number you know is real,\u00a0not the info in the email.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "2. Remove your data from the internet: Scammers are able to send you targeted messages because your data, like your email address or phone number, is already out there. This often happens due to past data breaches and shady data brokers. A data removal service can help clean up your digital trail by removing your information from public databases and people-search sites. It\u2019s not a quick fix, but over time, it reduces how easily scammers can find and target you.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice.\u00a0They aren\u2019t cheap, and neither is your privacy.\u00a0These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It\u2019s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.\u00a0By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",

      "Get a\u00a0free scan\u00a0to find out if your personal information is already out on the web.",
      "3. Check your account activity:\u00a0Go to your account\u2019s security or sign-in page. Services like Gmail, iCloud or your bank let you review recent logins and devices. If you see nothing unusual, you\u2019re safe. If you do find a strange login, follow the site\u2019s process (usually changing your password and logging out all devices). Even if you don\u2019t find anything odd, change your password as a precaution. Do it through the official site or app, not the email. Consider using a\u00a0password manager to generate and store complex passwords.",
      "4. Enable two-factor authentication (2FA): This is your best backup. With\u00a02FA enabled, even if someone has your password, they can\u2019t gain access without your phone and an additional second factor. Both Google and Apple make 2FA easy and say it \"makes it harder for scammers\" to hijack your account.",
      "5. Report suspicious emails: If you receive a suspicious email claiming to be from a specific organization, report it to that organization\u2019s official support or security team so they can take appropriate action.",
      "THIS IS WHAT YOU ARE DOING WRONG WHEN SCAMMERS CALL",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "You shouldn\u2019t have to vet every sketchy email. In fact, your email\u2019s spam filters catch most phishing attempts for you. Keep them enabled, and make sure your software is up to date so that malicious sites and attachments are blocked. Still, the most powerful filter is your own awareness. You're definitely not alone in this. People receive these spammy login scares every day. By keeping a cool head and following the steps above, you're already ahead of the game.",

    "story": [
      "May 7 is the deadline to get a REAL ID, and some DMVs are facing large crowds and major backup. FOX's Asher Reed spoke with FOX 35 Orlando from outside a DMV in Antioch, Tennessee, with more on the issue.",
      "If you've received a text message claiming to be from your state's Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) and threatening you with fines or penalties unless you pay up, you're not alone. A new wave of scam texts is sweeping across the country, targeting drivers in states like Connecticut, Pennsylvania, Georgia, Florida, New York, California, Illinois, New Jersey, Virginia, Colorado, Vermont, Texas, North Carolina and even Washington, D.C.",
      "These messages look official and urgent, warning you about supposed unpaid tickets or tolls and demanding immediate payment. But don't be fooled, as these texts are sophisticated scams designed to steal your personal information or money.",
      "The scammers are getting better at making their messages look real, so it can be tricky to spot the fraud. But with a few simple tips, you can learn how to recognize these scams and protect yourself before you click or respond.",

      "How the DMV scam text message works",
      "These scam messages vary slightly depending on the state you're in, but they\u2019re generally structured in the same way. The text threatens consequences, such as credit score damage, revoked driving privileges, suspended vehicle registration or increased toll fees, if you do not pay the bill you have supposedly incurred. To make the message appear legit, the scammers often include a date for penalties to begin, a fake administrative code and a link that appears to be an official DMV website.",

      "Why DMV text scams are so convincing",
      "The scam relies on two key elements to be effective:\u00a0fear and a sense of urgency. These are two powerful psychological motivators that can send you into a panic since your driving privileges are at risk, or you're facing financial consequences. The aim is to get you to act hastily without pausing to verify the source. The messages also mimic legitimate government communications by including familiar terms, official-sounding codes and web addresses that appear authentic. Here is an example of what the text might look like:",

      "How to spot and avoid DMV text message scams",
      "If you receive a suspicious text message claiming to be from your state's DMV and demanding payment or personal information, follow these steps to protect yourself:",
      "1. Be skeptical of any message creating urgency or panic: Scammers rely on fear and urgency to trick you into acting without thinking. If a message pressures you to act immediately, that's a major red flag.",
      "2. Check for obvious red flags: Look for signs like strange sender addresses, awkward language, misspellings or links that don't match your state's official DMV website.",
      "3. Do not click any links or reply, and use strong antivirus software: Legitimate DMVs will not ask for payments, personal details or sensitive information via unsolicited text messages. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "4. Verify directly with your DMV: If you're concerned the message might be real, contact your state's DMV using the official website or a trusted phone number. Never use the contact information provided in the suspicious text.",
      "5. Consider a Personal Data Removal Service:\u00a0Your personal information is widely available online, which can make you a bigger target for these types of scams, therefore you might look into a personal data removal service. These services work by submitting opt-out requests to data brokers that collect and sell your information, helping to reduce your digital footprint and making it harder for scammers to find your contact details.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren\u2019t cheap \u2014 and neither is your privacy.\u00a0 These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It\u2019s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.\u00a0 By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "6. Delete the message immediately and block the sender: Removing the text helps prevent accidental clicks and reduces the risk of falling for the scam later. Also, be sure to\u00a0block phone numbers and texts that send spam or scam messages, reducing future risk.",
      "7. Register your number with the\u00a0National Do Not Call Registry: While this won't stop all scams, it can help reduce unwanted communications.",
      "8. Don't provide any personal or financial information: Never share your Social Security number, driver's license number, banking information, or passwords in response to an unsolicited text.",
      "9. If you clicked the link or gave out information, act quickly: If you accidentally entered personal or financial information, contact your bank, credit card provider or local law enforcement right away to minimize potential damage.",
      "10. Keep your phone's security features updated: Ensure your\u00a0device's operating system and security software are current to help block known scam numbers and malicious links.",
      "11. Report the scam:\u00a0Forward the message to 7726 (SPAM) to alert your mobile provider and help block similar messages in the future. Mark the message as junk or spam within your messaging app, if possible. File a complaint with the Federal Trade Commission at\u00a0reportfraud.ftc.gov or the FBI's Internet Crime Complaint Center at\u00a0ic3.gov.",
      "DON\u2019T GET CAUGHT IN THE \"APPLE ID SUSPENDED\" PHISHING SCAM",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaways",
      "Scam texts pretending to be from the DMV are getting more convincing, but you don't have to be their next victim. Staying skeptical of urgent messages, double-checking anything that seems off and never clicking suspicious links can go a long way in protecting your personal information. Remember, the real DMV will never pressure you for payment or sensitive details over text. By staying alert, you can help prevent these scams and keep your personal information and money secure.",

      "E-BAR operates as a set of robotic handlebars that follow users.",
      "The demographic landscape in the U.S. is shifting rapidly, with the median age now at 38.9, almost a decade older than it was in 1980.",
      "By 2050, the population of adults over 65 is projected to surge from 58 million to 82 million, intensifying the already urgent challenge of eldercare. With falls remaining the top cause of injury among older adults, the need for innovative, tech-driven solutions has never been clearer.",

      "How MIT\u2019s E-BAR robot helps prevent falls and support senior mobility",
      "E-BAR, short for\u00a0Elderly Bodily Assistance Robot, is not your typical assistive device. Rather than relying on harnesses or wearables, which many seniors find cumbersome or stigmatizing, E-BAR operates as a set of robotic handlebars that follow users from behind. This allows individuals to walk freely, lean on the robot's arms for support or receive full-body assistance when transitioning between sitting and standing. The robot's articulated body, constructed from 18 interconnected bars, mimics the natural movement of the human body, delivering a seamless and intuitive experience.",
      "AI ROBOTS HELP NURSES BEAT BURNOUT AND TRANSFORM HOSPITAL CARE",
      "The engineering behind E-BAR's mobility is equally impressive. The robot's 220-pound base is meticulously designed to support the weight of an average adult without tipping or slipping, and its omnidirectional wheels enable smooth navigation through tight spaces and around household obstacles. This means E-BAR can move effortlessly alongside users, providing support in real time, whether they are reaching for a high shelf or stepping out of a bathtub.",

      "BEST CREDIT CARDS FOR SENIORS AND RETIREES 2025",
      "Inside MIT\u2019s E-BAR: A fall-prevention robot designed for aging in place",
      "What sets E-BAR apart from previous eldercare robots is its integrated fall-prevention system. Each arm is embedded with airbags made from soft, grippable materials that can inflate instantly if a fall is detected. This rapid response cushions the user without causing bruising, and, crucially, it does so without requiring the user to wear any special gear. In lab tests, E-BAR successfully supported elderly volunteers as they performed everyday tasks that often pose a risk for falls, such as bending down, stretching up or navigating the tricky edge of a bathtub.",
      "Currently, E-BAR is operated via remote control, but the MIT team is already working on automating its navigation and assistance features. The vision is for future versions to autonomously follow users, assess their real-time fall risk using machine learning algorithms and provide adaptive support as their mobility needs evolve.",

      "The E-BAR project is rooted in extensive interviews with seniors and caregivers, which revealed a strong preference for unobtrusive, non-restrictive support systems. E-BAR's U-shaped handlebars leave the front of the user completely open, allowing for a natural stride and easy exit at any time. The robot is slim enough to fit through standard doorways and is designed to blend into the home environment, making it a practical addition rather than an intrusive medical device.",
      "MIT researchers see E-BAR as part of a broader ecosystem of assistive technologies, each tailored to different stages of aging and mobility. While some devices may offer predictive fall detection or harness-based support, E-BAR's unique combination of full-body assistance, fall prevention and user autonomy addresses a critical gap for those who want to maintain independence but need occasional support.",

The research team is continuing to refine the design and aims to bring it to market in the coming years, but it could take 5\u201310 years before the device receives full regulatory approval and becomes commercially accessible.",
      "Looking forward, the research team is also focused on refining E-BAR's design to make it slimmer, more maneuverable and even more intuitive to use. They are also exploring ways to integrate advanced AI for real-time fall prediction and adaptive assistance, ensuring that the robot can meet users' changing needs as they age.

From online shopping habits to fitness tracking logs, personal information ends up in hundreds of company databases. While most people worry about social media leaks or email hacks, a far less visible threat comes from data brokers.",
      "I still find it hard to believe that companies like this are allowed to operate with so little legal scrutiny. These firms trade in personal information without our knowledge or consent. What baffles me even more is that they aren\u2019t serious about protecting the one thing that is central to their business model: data.",
      "Just last year, we saw news of a massive data breach at a data broker called National Public Data, which\u00a0exposed 2.7 billion records. And now another data broker, LexisNexis, a major name in the industry, has reported a significant breach that exposed sensitive information from more than 364,000 people.",

      "LexisNexis breach went undetected for months after holiday hack",
      "LexisNexis filed a\u00a0notice with the Maine attorney general revealing that a hacker accessed consumer data through a third-party software development platform. The breach happened on Dec. 25, 2024, but the company only discovered it months later. LexisNexis was alerted on April 1, 2025, by an unnamed individual who claimed to have found sensitive files. It remains unclear whether this person was responsible for the breach or merely came across the exposed data.",
      "MASSIVE DATA BREACH EXPOSES 184 MILLION PASSWORDS AND LOGINS",
      "A spokesperson for LexisNexis confirmed that the hacker gained access to the company\u2019s GitHub account. This is a platform commonly used by developers to store and collaborate on code. Security guidelines repeatedly warn against storing sensitive information in such repositories; however, mistakes such as exposed access tokens and personal data files continue to occur.",
      "The stolen data varies from person to person but includes full names, birthdates, phone numbers, mailing and email addresses, Social Security numbers and driver's license numbers. LexisNexis has not confirmed whether it received any ransom demand or had further contact with the attacker.",

      "CUSTOM DATA REMOVAL: WHY IT MATTERS FOR PERSONAL INFO ONLINE",
      "Why the LexisNexis hack is a bigger threat than you realize",
      "LexisNexis isn\u2019t a household name for most people, but it plays a major role in how personal data is harvested and used behind the scenes. The company pulls information from a wide range of sources, compiling detailed profiles that help other businesses assess risk and detect fraud. Its clients include banks, insurance companies and government agencies.",
      "In 2023, the New York Times reported that several car manufacturers had been sharing driving data with LexisNexis without notifying vehicle owners. That information was then sold to insurance companies, which used it to adjust premiums based on individual driving behavior. The story made one thing clear. LexisNexis has access to a staggering amount of personal detail, even from people who have never willingly engaged with the company.",
      "Law enforcement also uses LexisNexis tools to dig up information on suspects. These systems offer access to phone records, home addresses and other historical data. While such tools might assist in investigations, they also highlight a serious issue. When this much sensitive information is concentrated in one place, it becomes a single point of failure. And as the recent breach shows, that failure is no longer hypothetical.",

      "7 expert tips to protect your personal data after a data broker breach",
      "Keeping your personal data safe online can feel overwhelming, but a few practical steps can make a big difference in protecting your privacy and reducing your digital footprint. Here are 7 effective ways to take control of your information and keep it out of the wrong hands:",
      "1. Remove your data from the internet:\u00a0The most effective way to take control of your data and avoid data brokers from selling it is to opt for data removal services. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time. Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "Get a\u00a0free scan to find out if your personal information is already out on the web.",
      "2. Review privacy settings: Take a few minutes to explore the privacy and security settings on the services you use. For example, limit who can see your social media posts, disable unnecessary location-sharing on your phone and consider turning off ad personalization on accounts like Google and Facebook. Most browsers let you block third-party cookies or clear tracking data. The FTC suggests comparing the privacy notices of different sites and apps and choosing ones that let you opt out of sharing when possible.",
      "3. Use privacy-friendly tools: Install browser extensions or plugins that block ads and trackers (such as uBlock Origin or Privacy Badger). You might switch to a more private search engine (like DuckDuckGo or Brave) that doesn\u2019t log your queries. Consider using a browser\u2019s \"incognito\" or private mode when you don\u2019t want your history saved, and regularly clear your cookies and cache. Even small habits, like logging out of accounts when not in use or using a password manager, make you less trackable.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "4. Beware of phishing links and use strong antivirus software:\u00a0Scammers may try to get access to your financial details and other important data using phishing links. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping\u00a0your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "5. Be cautious with personal data: Think twice before sharing extra details. Don\u2019t fill out online surveys or quizzes that ask for personal or financial information unless you trust the source. Create separate email addresses for sign-ups (so marketing emails don\u2019t go to your main inbox). Only download apps from official stores and check app permissions.",
      "6. Opt out of data broker lists: Many data brokers offer ways to opt out or delete your information, though it can be a tedious process. For example, there are sites like Privacy Rights Clearinghouse or the Whitepages opt-out page that list popular brokers and their opt-out procedures. The FTC\u2019s consumer guide,\u00a0\"Your Guide to Protecting Your Privacy Online,\" includes tips on opting out of targeted ads and removing yourself from people-search databases. Keep in mind you may have to repeat this every few months.",
      "7. Be wary of mailbox communications:\u00a0Bad actors may also try to scam you through snail mail. The data leak gives them access to your address. They may impersonate people or brands you know and use themes that require urgent attention, such as missed deliveries, account suspensions and security alerts.",
      "HR FIRM CONFIRMS 4M RECORDS EXPOSED IN MAJOR HACK",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "For many, the LexisNexis breach may be the first time they realize just how much of their data is in circulation. Unlike a social media platform or a bank, there is no clear customer relationship with a data broker, and that makes it harder to demand transparency. This incident should prompt serious discussion around what kind of oversight is necessary in industries that operate in the shadows. A more informed public and stronger regulation may be the only things standing between personal data and permanent exposure.",

      "Phantom 3500 (Otto Aviation)",
      "Why is windowless design such a big deal for aircraft?",
      "Most travelers don't realize that windows are structural weak points in an aircraft. They require extra reinforcement, add weight and disrupt the smooth flow of air over the fuselage (the main body of the plane). This increases drag, a resistance force that makes flight less efficient. By removing windows, the Phantom 3500's surface allows air to flow with minimal turbulence, helping the aircraft achieve what Otto Aviation describes as \"full laminar flow characteristics.\"",
      "HYPERSONIC JET PROMISES NYC TO LONDON IN UNDER AN HOUR",
      "This is a major contributor to its impressive aerodynamic performance. The windowless design is not just for aesthetics. Otto Aviation specifically engineered the fuselage to optimize laminar flow, using lightweight materials and smooth surfaces to further reduce drag and fuel consumption.",

      "A common concern with windowless aircraft is claustrophobia. To address this, the Phantom 3500 features high-definition digital screens along the cabin walls and ceiling. These displays stream real-time video from cameras mounted on the aircraft's exterior, offering passengers a panoramic, immersive view of the skies. Otto Aviation refers to this system as Super Natural Vision, a proprietary technology that replaces traditional windows with state-of-the-art digital displays, seamlessly integrating real-time external views for a unique in-flight experience.",
      "The spacious, luminous cabin measures 800 cubic feet with a 6-foot-5-inch ceiling, comfortably accommodating four or more passengers in a luxurious, flexible layout. The cabin can seat up to nine passengers, depending on configuration, and is designed to maximize comfort and functionality. Freed from the constraints of window placement, the interior can be customized for relaxation, productivity or entertainment, ensuring passengers enjoy the journey as much as the destination.",

      "The Phantom 3500 builds on flight tests from Otto\u2019s Celera 500L prototype and Dassault Syst\u00e8mes\u2019 3DEXPERIENCE platform. By sustaining laminar flow, the aircraft aims to improve fuel efficiency by 35%. This allows it to maintain high-speed performance while consuming less fuel, making it one of the most aerodynamically efficient aircraft ever developed. It operates in the transonic range (Mach 0.8\u20131.2), balancing speed and efficiency. It can also reach a cruising altitude of 51,000 feet, significantly higher than most commercial airliners, which typically fly between 30,000 and 40,000 feet.",
      "Thanks to its streamlined fuselage and optimized aerodynamics, the Phantom 3500 burns 50% less fuel than conventional business jets. This reduction in fuel consumption translates to lower operating costs and a significant decrease in carbon emissions. The Phantom 3500\u2019s wings achieve complete laminar flow, allowing for smoother airflow and reduced drag, enabling the aircraft to take off from runways as short as 3,500 feet, nearly doubling the number of accessible airports in the U.S. alone compared to similar-sized jets.",

      "\"These are the men and women trained for foreign combat, not domestic law enforcement,\" Newsom said Tuesday. \"We honor their service. We honor their bravery.

      "\u201cThis is about all of us. This is about you. California may be first, but it clearly will not end here. Other states are next. Democracy is next. Democracy is under assault before our eyes. This moment we have feared has arrived,\" Newsom said.",
      "\"Authoritarian regimes begin by targeting people who are least able to defend themselves. But they do not stop there,\" he said.",
      "Follow live politics coverage here",
      "Trump has activated thousands of National Guard members, without a request from Newsom, and deployed more than 700 Marines in California since the protests began Friday.",
      "He has also lobbed a barrage of criticism and personal insults at Newsom, at one point suggesting he should face arrest after he dared \u201cborder czar\u201d Tom Homan to apprehend him.",

    "story": [
      "Amid immigration raids, peaceful protests, attacks on law enforcement officers and the threat of his own arrest by federal agents, California Gov. Gavin Newsom is immersed in what could be the most consequential political fight of his career.",
      "The battle between the president and the governor of the country\u2019s largest state instantly turned Newsom into the face of resistance to President Donald Trump\u2019s expansive interpretation of the authorities of his office and mass-deportation campaign. Newsom, who is a potential 2028 Democratic presidential candidate, has been taking heavy criticism from within his own party over his efforts \u2014 in part through his new podcast \u2014 to cast himself in the role of conciliator.",
      "Newsom delivered an address Tuesday night that aimed squarely at Trump and was clearly intended for a national audience.",
      "\"This isn't just about protests here in Los Angeles,\" he said. \"When Donald Trump sought blanket authority to commander the National Guard, he made that order apply to every state in this nation. This is about all of us. This is about you. California may be first, but it clearly will not end here. Other states are next. Democracy is next. Democracy is under assault before our eyes. This moment we have feared has arrived.\"",
      "\u201cFor someone like Newsom, the balance is: Is he able to be tough enough? Will he stand up to Trump? How does he lead at this moment?\u201d said Democratic strategist Karen Finney. \u201cThis is unprecedented. There\u2019s not a right answer. So far, he\u2019s doing the right things, being clear, consistent, clear communication.\u201d",
      "Newsom could try to turn the situation on Trump by pointing to government overreach, but at the same time, there is real risk of an eruption violence from rogue actors, said Matt Bennett, co-founder of Third Way, a center-left think tank.",
      "\u201cThe images of the militarization of this for no reason should be enough for Newsom to win this debate as long as they can keep control of the worst of the violence,\" he said.",
      "\u201cTrump always goes too far,\u201d Bennett added. \u201cLast time, he went too far with the Muslim ban. Then he really went too far with child separation \u2014 those images really hurt Trump. Here, it\u2019s a real question. It\u2019s a much closer call this time. We just don\u2019t know yet.\u201d",
      "As it is, Newsom must balance forces that are both inside and outside of his control. That includes competing with messaging from Trump (who frequently refers to the governor as \"Newscum\") and the president's top lieutenants, who are ever-present on cable news, social media and political podcasts. And it involves attempting to quell violent actors while pointing to Trump's actions \u2014 which have included deploying the U.S. Marines \u2014 as an overreach.",
      "The White House maintains it is winning the public relations battle, with officials tapping a refrain this week that it was the fight they wanted replete with made-for-TV images. They included images of billowing black smoke and Waymo vehicles that protesters had set on fire.",
      "On Monday, California sued Trump for using emergency powers to deploy National Guard troops to the Los Angeles area over the weekend. Trump, citing a statute that allows the president to activate the guard to repel a foreign invasion or quell a rebellion, accused Newsom and Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass of failing to protect federal agents and property from demonstrators.",
      "Newsom has slammed the step as escalatory and said existing law enforcement could have handled any violence or destruction. He argued that the move was \u201cpurposefully inflammatory and will only escalate tensions\u201d and that there was \u201ccurrently no unmet need.\u201d",
      "Newsom has also been mounting his own messaging offensive, including on X, where he posted what appeared to be photos of troops crowded on a floor, apparently attempting to rest.",
      "\"You sent your troops here without fuel, food, water or a place to sleep. Here they are \u2014 being forced to sleep on the floor, piled on top of one another. If anyone is treating our troops disrespectfully, it is you @realDonaldTrump,\" Newsom said on X.",
      "On Sunday, Newsom chided Trump \"border czar\" Tom Homan, saying in an MSNBC interview: \"Tom, arrest me. Let\u2019s go.\"",
      "Late Monday, Newsom sat for a \"Pod Save America\" podcast recording in which he cast Trump's actions as unconstitutional and said some of those assigned to Los Angeles \u2014 in his view, unnecessarily \u2014 were pried away from fentanyl investigations, and potentially from border operations, for \"this theatrical display of toughness by a president of the United States who is unhinged.\"",
      "By Tuesday morning, Newsom accused Trump and his top White House deportation architect Stephen Miller of sheltering insurrectionists.",
      "\"The only people defending insurrectionists are you and @realDonaldTrump. Or, are we pretending like you didn\u2019t pardon 1500 of them?\"",
      "On Tuesday afternoon, the two were locked in another public squabble after Trump told reporters he delivered some tough words to Newsom in a phone call Monday. Newsom said the two hadn't spoken since Friday, then posted an interview with NBC News from over the weekend in which Newsom contended he and Trump had a pleasant conversation and that the president barely talked about the issue at hand.",
      "The White House had a different take.",
      "\u201cThe President called Gavin Newsom to tell him to get his ass in gear,\" White House spokesman Steven Cheung said in a statement. \"The only liar here is Newsom who continues to fail his state as he prioritizes doing interviews with leftist media to gaslight the public instead of helping his state.\u201d",
      "At that, Newsom responded on X: \"Donald Trump is a stone cold liar.\"",
      "Since November's presidential election, Newsom seemed content to lie low and get a better measure of Trump's political appeal as he contemplated a run for the Oval Office. He has also taken some heat from his own party for hosting MAGA figures on his podcast and saying he opposes allowing trans athletes on girls' teams in college and youth sports.",
      "Trump's move on the protests, however, has forced Newsom to pick sides on an issue that the president and White House officials believe they have the political edge.",
      "Now, Democratic leaders say their party is galvanizing behind Newsom \u2014 at least for the moment \u2014 and it would be difficult for prospective rivals to do anything but fall in line behind him when he is taking a stand on turf that is popular with Democratic voters.",
      "Friends of Newsom say it would be an unexpected political boon for the governor if Trump and Homan follow through on their threat to arrest him if they decide he has broken the law.",
      "That would be \"a Nelson Mandela moment\" for Newsom, said one longtime ally, referring to the imprisonment of the anti-apartheid leader and recalling that indictments helped Trump win the 2024 Republican presidential nomination.",
      "At the same time, that ally and others are careful to depict the governor as focused on the substance of the battle with Trump, rather than the political risks or rewards.",
      "\"He's not going to stand by idly while President Trump aims to destroy California,\" said California state Rep. Buffy Wicks, a Democrat who often aligns with Newsom. \"I do not think it's a political calculation. It's genuinely how he feels, and he's leading with his heart on it.\"",
      "Another observer had a different take: \u201cThis whole fiasco could make Gavin president,\u201d Anthony Scaramucci, the short-lived White House communications director in Trump\u2019s first term, wrote Monday on X.",
      "The obvious pitfall for Newsom is that Trump could take credit for restoring order or, if violence escalates, continue to pour blame on him. Democrats in the state say that they believe Trump is intentionally sowing discord and that Newsom's best political move is to do his job well.",
      "\"The most important thing he can do is show he can manage a crisis,\" said Rep. Eric Swalwell, D-Calif. \"Good governance is always the best politics \u2014 to just show competence contrasting with Trump\u2019s chaos.\"",
      "Trump has deployed 700 Marines to Los Angeles to support the roughly 300 National Guard members already on the ground. The president had already ordered the deployment of 2,000 National Guard troops. It remains to be seen how the courts will come down on California's lawsuit.",
      "The relevant law allows the president to activate the National Guard domestically in order to quell a foreign invasion or a rebellion against the U.S. government, and Trump, calling protesters \"insurrectionists,\" declared the demonstrations a \"rebellion.\"",
      "The California attorney general argues in the lawsuit, which was filed in federal court in Northern California, that Trump has illegally usurped the authority of the state by fabricating a rebellion and that the presence of guard forces\u00a0is exacerbating tension between protesters and law enforcement officers.",
      "The powers to deploy the National Guard are divided between presidents and governors, with state executives generally controlling when they are activated within their own state \u2014 as opposed to being deployed to foreign wars.",
      "Former Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe, a Democrat, said in an interview with NBC News that governors routinely work with the White House, regardless of party, to mobilize National Guard forces for a variety of tasks, including the response to natural disasters. At times, governors have asked presidents to deploy guard forces to restore order in their states during riots. But not since the Civil Rights era has a president called up the National guard to enforce the law over the objection of the state's governor.",
      "Democrats say that it's up to state and local law enforcement to keep the peace and that there was no need for Trump to federalize troops \u2014 especially without the consent of the governor.",
      "\"Gavin's mad as hell and he should be,\" McAuliffe said. \"This is the governor's responsibility, not the president's.\"",
      "Bennett flagged concerns about introducing the U.S. Marines into the situation, saying they are not trained in controlling crowds of Americans.",
      "\u201cThis is a very, very dangerous thing,\" Bennett said. \"God forbid, if they hurt somebody \u2026 that\u2019s real trouble for Trump. But [we\u2019re] not rooting for that.\u201d"

      "The monthly inflation report set to be released Wednesday by the Bureau of Labor Statistics is expected to provide the most definitive look yet at whether U.S. companies are passing the cost of President Donald Trump's higher import duties on to customers.",
      "And there\u2019s some anticipation that inflation has ticked up. The Consumer Price Index, which tracks changes in prices for consumer goods and services, is forecast to show a 12-month increase of 2.4% in May, compared with a 2.3% annual pace in April, according to a survey by Dow Jones Newswires.",
      "\u201cCore\u201d inflation, a measure closely watched by economists that excludes prices for food and energy, which tend to fluctuate more, is expected to rise 2.9% over the year, up from 2.8% in April. The core month-on-month reading was expected to climb to 0.3% from 0.2% in April.",
      "The president\u2019s on-again, off-again tariffs and trade-deal announcements have scrambled the spending plans of businesses and consumers. As a result, sentiment surveys have shown deteriorating confidence since April, when Trump rolled out his \u201cLiberation Day\u201d tariffs that reset the base U.S. import duty level to 10%.",
      "Trump campaigned on promises to bring price relief to Americans, but economists say his tariffs by definition will lead to price increases.",
      "As price pressures from the tariffs have begun to build, businesses are signaling they will pass along higher prices to customers \u2014 in spite of Trump\u2019s warnings not to do so.",
      "Walmart said last month that consumers would soon start seeing higher costs. The National Federation of Independent Businesses reported Tuesday that a net 31% of its surveyed members planned price hikes last month, up from 28% in April.",
      "\u201cWalmart making their announcement that customers are going to start seeing higher prices really underscores how businesses are starting to feel this,\u201d said Stephen Kates, financial analyst with Bankrate. \u201cAnd if the largest businesses are saying this, smaller businesses are definitely feeling it, too \u2014 there\u2019s no way around that fact.\u201d",
      "Walmart responded to Trump\u2019s threats by saying it would \u201ckeep prices as low as we can for as long as we can given the reality of small retail margins.\u201d",
      "Price inflation is already hitting other parts of the economy. In May, U.S. factories registered the highest share of price-increase reports since November 2022, S&P Global, a data and business consultancy group, said last week.",
      "And firms quoted in the Institute of Supply Management\u2019s latest manufacturing report noted the president\u2019s tariffs have wreaked havoc on their ability to plan for the future as they deal with the prospect of higher costs.",
      "If there has been any price relief, it is likely the result of an overall slowing economy, analysts say, with a weakening labor market forcing consumers to cut back on spending. The pace of airfare, hotel and gas-price growth was likely lower in May as customers reduced their travel, with new Bank of America data showing spending rates remain below levels seen before Trump took office.",
      "Even if May\u2019s price-growth data comes in milder than expected, economists say past experience suggests the coming months will more fully capture the impact from the tariffs. In a note to clients this week, Pantheon Macroeconomics analysts said it took a full three months before the price increases from Trump\u2019s 2018 washing machine tariffs showed up in data \u2014 but that when they did, the pass-through was \u201crapid and complete.\u201d",
      "That suggests it would take until July for the tariffs \u2014 the bulk of which were announced in April \u2014 to begin to fully appear.",
      "Even if the pace of price growth is no longer at the pace seen in 2022, when inflation rates reached levels not seen in decades, Bankrate\u2019s Kates said consumers are still going to be left smarting.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s going to be a persistent itch that doesn\u2019t go away,\u201d Kates said."

      "The tanks and artillery launchers rolling through Washington on Saturday will honor the Army\u2019s 250th anniversary, which falls on the day Trump turns 79.",
      "About 7,000 soldiers will march. Hundreds of thousands of people are expected to line up along Constitution Avenue on the co-birthdays and cheer. Trump is set to watch the spectacle from a viewing stand south of the White House.",
      "But in Washington and in all 50 states, organizers will be staging protests that could dwarf the parade in size. A coalition of pro-democracy, labor and liberal activists is arranging a full day of counterprogramming to make the case that Trump is hijacking the Army celebration to venerate himself.",
      "\u201cThe goal here is to deprive Trump of what he wants in this moment, which is a story about him being the all-powerful political figure of our time, and instead create a contrast with normal, everyday people demonstrating that power in this country still resides with the people,\u201d said Ezra Levin, a co-founder of the progressive group Indivisible, who is helping organize what participants have dubbed a nationwide \u201cNo Kings\u201d demonstration.",
      "If past protests are a guide, the participants could number in the millions, he said. A total of 1,800 rallies are expected, with events in each congressional district, he added.",
      "Another group called Women\u2019s March is also arranging protests to coincide with the parade, with a theme of \u201cKick Out the Clowns.\u201d Organizers expect up to 5,000 people to participate in Madison, Wisconsin, alone, said Tamika Middleton, chief political and strategy officer of Women\u2019s March.",
      "\u201cNothing feels more absurd than the idea of this president having a massive military parade on his birthday,\u201d she said. \"It feels surreal for many of us.\u201d",
      "NBC News reached out to the White House for comment.",
      "On Tuesday, Rand Paul of Kentucky became the first Senate Republican to criticize the parade, citing the imagery. Showing off lethal hardware is something other countries do, not the United States, he said.",
      "\u201cI wouldn\u2019t have done it,\" Paul told reporters. He added that \"we were always different than the images you saw in the Soviet Union and North Korea. We were proud not to be that.\"",
      "Trump isn't deterred. Speaking in the Oval Office on Tuesday, he warned that protesters this weekend will face \"very big force.\"  He didn't distinguish between those who demonstrate peacefully or violently.",
      "\"And I haven\u2019t even heard about a protest,\" Trump added, \"but you know, this is people that hate our country. But they will be met with very heavy force.\" (At a news briefing this week, a Secret Service official said thousands of agents and officers will be on hand to provide security.)",
      "The parade is happening at a fraught moment when Trump has drawn the military \u2014 among the nation\u2019s most trusted institutions \u2014 into a tense standoff in Los Angeles over his aggressive efforts to deport people living in the United States illegally. The Trump administration this week activated about 700 Marines to help quell demonstrations over his immigration enforcement methods, despite warnings from California officials that he is inflaming the situation.",
      "The military\u2019s main purpose is to fight and win foreign wars, and it has largely retained its reputation as an apolitical body carrying out a national mission. Only in rare instances has the nation held military parades: The last one took place 34 years ago after the United States defeated Iraq in the first Gulf War.",
      "Saturday will open with a festival on the National Mall. Soldiers will be on hand to meet people and take part in special military demonstrations.",
      "The parade will start at 6:30 p.m. ET and follow Constitution Avenue from near the Lincoln Memorial to the Ellipse south of the White House. Workers have been laying down steel plates to protect the roads from the heavy tanks. Bradley Fighting Vehicles will also be on display, while dozens of helicopters will take part in a flyover. At the Senate Armed Services hearing last Thursday, Army Secretary Daniel Driscoll put the cost at $25 million to $40 million.",
      "Driscoll justified the expense as a \u201conce-in-a-lifetime opportunity to fill up our recruiting pipeline with young Americans.\u201d",
      "Trump told NBC News in May that the cost was \"peanuts compared to the value.\"",
      "\u201cWe have the greatest missiles in the world. We have the greatest submarines in the world. We have the greatest Army tanks in the world. We have the greatest weapons in the world. And we\u2019re going to celebrate it,\u201d he said in an interview with \"Meet the Press.\"",
      "Some military experts echoed that sentiment, seeing merit in an event that gives Americans a chance to thank their soldiers and see them up close.",
      "\u201cOnly 9% of young Americans have an inclination toward military service,\u201d said Kori Schake, who has worked at both the Defense Department and the White House National Security Council. \u201cAnd so, exposing more Americans to our Army, where kids can talk to soldiers about their experience, is good for the country.\u201d",
      "Others said the money is being wasted. A better idea would be to restore programs serving veterans or rehiring some of those who lost their jobs in the Trump administration\u2019s effort to shrink the government workforce, some lawmakers and veterans groups said.",
      "Department of Government Efficiency cuts have fallen heavily on veterans, who make up a disproportionate share of the federal workforce. Meanwhile, the Veterans Affairs Department cut a program that provides mortgage assistance to veterans so they don\u2019t face foreclosure on their homes.",
      "The mortgage program \u201chelped tens of thousands of veterans stay in their homes. And they want to spend $50 million on a parade?\u201d said Chris Purdy, who heads the Chamberlain Network, a pro-veterans group. \u201cIt really shows this is about an individual\u2019s pride and not the nation\u2019s pride.\u201d",
      "Rep. Adam Smith, D-Wash., a member of the House Armed Services Committee, criticized the parade's price tag in an interview.",
      "\"The military is being required to spend resources and time on this, instead of training and preparing to meet the national security needs of the country,\" he said, adding, \u201cIt\u2019s a horrible idea.\"",
      "Trump has long championed a military parade. In 2017, he attended the Bastille Day ceremony in Paris with French President Emmanuel Macron and got a firsthand look as tanks rumbled past the reviewing stand.",
      "The trip left an impression. After he returned to the White House, Trump spoke often about holding a similar parade at home, a former White House official said. Aides delayed and diverted him, mentioning the potential cost and telling him the United States didn't make a point of flaunting its hardware, the person said.",
      "\u201cCertainly, the French do it a lot and the North Koreans do it a lot and the Russians, but we don\u2019t really tend to do those things,\u201d the former official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.",
      "\u201cHe brought it up quite a bit,\u201d the person continued.",
      "In his Oval Office remarks, Trump didn't mention the parade in the context of his birthday. He noted instead that the day is Flag Day.",
      "\"We\u2019re going to have a fantastic June 14th parade, Flag Day,\" he said. \"It\u2019s going to be an amazing day. We have tanks, we have planes, we have all sorts of things. And I think it\u2019s going to be great. We\u2019re going to celebrate our country for a change.\"",
      "Whether the day comes off as a tribute to the Army or to Trump hinges on how Trump behaves in the moment, analysts said.",
      "\u201cThe degree to which this is a violation of norms depends in part on what the president says and does on the margins of this event,\u201d said Peter Feaver, a Duke University political science professor who has written about the military\u2019s relationship with political leaders.",
      "In the run-up to the parade, Trump is capitalizing on the Army's milestone birthday in partisan terms. Speaking Tuesday at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, he took aim at various Democratic foes, including the last commander in chief, Joe Biden. He invoked Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass, another Democrat, eliciting boos from the audience.",
      "Mentioning Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, the Democratic vice presidential nominee last year, Trump said: \"I think he's running for president, but he's a radical lunatic.\"",
      "Linking the military to the sitting president\u2019s birthday and sending it into the streets to confront fellow Americans risk tarnishing its credibility while pushing the country away from its democratic roots, Trump's critics warn.",
      "\u201cDisplays of hardware, whether its tanks or Stryker vehicles, is more characteristic of totalitarian militaristic states like North Korea or Russia,\u201d said Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, who questioned the event\u2019s cost at a recent hearing with Army leaders. \u201cAnd they are used in part to glorify the dictator in those countries. This parade falls on President Trump\u2019s birthday and is as much a celebration of his birthday and him \u2014 at least it\u2019s designed to be \u2014 as it is our Army.\u201d"

      "The matchup in New Jersey's race for governor is officially set \u2014 and Tuesday\u2019s primaries also laid down big indicators about the state of both political parties after the first major intraparty contests since the 2024 election.",
      "Republican Jack Ciattarelli, a former state legislator, easily won his party\u2019s primary with President Donald Trump\u2019s endorsement, underscoring Trump\u2019s significant sway over the GOP electorate.",
      "U.S. Rep. Mikie Sherrill won the crowded Democratic primary, pitching herself as the candidate with the best shot at holding on to the governorship and steering past ideological and antiestablishment sentiment simmering in her party. She defeated candidates who were to her left and to her right.",
      "The race to replace term-limited Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy, one of two governor\u2019s races this year, is expected to be competitive. Trump lost the state by 6 percentage points in November, a 10-point swing in his direction compared with his 2020 margin.",
      "Here are five takeaways from Tuesday\u2019s primaries:",
      "Democrats revive 2018 playbook",
      "Sherrill won as many Democratic voters were weighing which candidate would be most electable and as each Democratic candidate pitched a different path forward for the party.",
      "Sherrill\u2019s victory suggests some Democratic voters want to dust off the party\u2019s successful playbook from the 2018 midterm elections, when she flipped a longtime Republican-held House seat. In that campaign and in her primary run this year, Sherrill stressed her background as a Navy helicopter pilot and a former federal prosecutor and pitched \u201cruthless competence\u201d as a counter to Trump.",
      "\u201cIt just seems so obvious to me what the path forward is. It\u2019s effectively govern,\u201d Sherrill recently told NBC News. \u201cAnd this is what I\u2019ve been doing since 2018 when I first ran, right? ... I say to people, \u2018What\u2019s keeping you up at night?\u2019\u201d",
      "\u201cI tell people it\u2019s not maybe the sexiest tagline, but ruthless competence is what people in New Jersey want to see in government,\u201d Sherrill added later. \u201cAnd that\u2019s what I\u2019ve always provided, and that\u2019s what I think stands in stark contrast to the most incompetent federal government we\u2019ve probably ever seen in this nation.\u201d",
      "Still, while Sherrill won with over a third of the vote, the results revealed a fractured party.",
      "Two candidates who pitched themselves as more progressive, Newark Mayor Ras Baraka and Jersey City Mayor Steve Fulop, won a combined 36% of the vote. Two of the more moderate candidates, U.S. Rep. Josh Gottheimer and former state Senate President Steve Sweeney, got 20% combined, while teachers union president Sean Spiller won 10%.",
      "Trump boosts Ciattarelli with the MAGA faithful and shows his hold on the GOP",
      "After having come just 3 percentage points shy of defeating Murphy in 2021, Ciattarelli made one thing clear in his bid four years later: He\u2019s all in on Trump.",
      "Like many prominent Republicans, Ciattarelli wasn\u2019t always on board \u2014 he criticized Trump as a \u201ccharlatan\u201d in 2015. And while he embraced Trump during his previous bid for governor, he didn\u2019t campaign with him.",
      "That led Ciattarelli\u2019s opponents, including his top competitor, former radio host Bill Spadea, to try to frame him as insufficiently loyal to Trump. (Spadea had voiced criticism of Trump before he fell back in line.)",
      "But Trump\u2019s endorsement of Ciattarelli cemented his front-runner status, helping hasten the end of the campaign. And in a nod to Ciattarelli\u2019s past criticism, Trump tried to inoculate him from any attempt to undercut his Trump bona fides.",
      "\u201cJack, who after getting to know and understand MAGA, has gone ALL IN, and is now 100% (PLUS!),\u201d Trump wrote in a Truth Social post announcing his backing.",
      "Tuesday\u2019s result suggests that Trump\u2019s seal of approval was good enough for most GOP primary voters. By late Tuesday evening, Ciattarelli was carrying all of the state\u2019s 21 counties.",
      "Ciattarelli\u2019s vote share was at 67% by late Tuesday evening, compared with just 22% for Spadea. State Sen. Jon Bramnick, who had been critical of Trump, had won just 6%, followed by two other candidates who had each won less than 3% of the vote.",
      "Ciattarelli thanked Trump in his victory speech for his \u201cendorsement and strong support,\u201d making a joke about his being a \u201cpart-time New Jersey resident.\u201d (Trump owns a home and a golf course in Bedminster.)",
      "But Ciattarelli spent most of his speech focused on a general election argument, not on shoring up his base \u2014 indicative of the line he\u2019ll have to walk in a state Trump lost three times, even after the improvement he showed last year.",
      "Old-school political machines still have some sway",
      "Both parties are grappling with antiestablishment sentiment, wondering how to handle it, channel it or just avoid getting run over by it. But Tuesday\u2019s results were also a reminder that political institutions still have some staying power.",
      "New Jersey's traditional political machines were dealt a blow last year following a lawsuit from Democrat Andy Kim during his Senate run, when a court ordered that county parties could no longer give advantageous ballot positions to their preferred candidates.",
      "That diminished the sway those parties had Tuesday, but they still demonstrated some power.",
      "Ciattarelli was the only Republican who competed for county party endorsements. Fulop didn\u2019t compete for Democratic county party endorsements, and Gottheimer sat some out, as well. Some county parties split between the candidates, with Sherrill earning the most endorsements from 10 of the 21 counties.",
      "While Sherrill was carrying 15 of the state\u2019s 21 counties late Tuesday, Gottheimer was winning his home county, Bergen, which endorsed him. Sweeney, the only candidate from South Jersey, fared far better in the six counties that backed him. He was winning 40% of the vote in Gloucester County while garnering 7% of the statewide vote.",
      "The county party endorsements were no guarantee of victory: The Essex County Democrats, for example, endorsed Sherrill. But as of late Tuesday evening, she was trailing Baraka in Essex County, where he is mayor of Newark, the state\u2019s largest city.",
      "Even in that instance, though, the party endorsement may have helped Sherrill cut Baraka's margins in his home base.",
      "Both parties frame the November fight",
      "Tuesday night\u2019s victory speeches were also important table-setters, indicative of how each party is looking to frame the general election. And New Jersey's general election this year may foreshadow much of what we see on the campaign trail around the country in the 2026 midterms.",
      "Outside of a quick thanks to Trump, Ciattarelli kept his focus tightly on Sherrill and New Jersey Democrats in his victory speech. He criticized her as \u201cPhil Murphy 2.0,\u201d arguing that she has \u201cenabled every extremist and costly idea Phil Murphy has put forth,\u201d and he even revived a key criticism of Murphy from his 2021 campaign.",
      "He also criticized Sherrill\u2019s focus on Trump as a deflection.",
      "\u201cMark my words: While we focus on these key New Jersey issues, my Democratic opponent will do everything in her power. Trust me ... if you took a shot every time Mikie Sherrill says \u2018Trump,\u2019 you\u2019d be drunk off your ass every day between now and Nov. 4,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cBut every time you hear her say \u2018Trump,\u2019 I want you to know what it really means: What it really means is Mikie doesn\u2019t have a plan to fix New Jersey,\u201d he continued.",
      "During her victory speech, Sherrill leaned heavily on her biography but also emphasized a dual mandate \u2014 a fight against New Jersey Republicans and also against Trump, a recipe that Democrats have successfully leaned on in past midterm elections.",
      "Calling Ciattarelli a \u201cTrump lackey\u201d who shouldn\u2019t lead the state, Sherrill criticized \u201cTrump and MAGA Republicans in D.C. [who] want to raise your taxes and take away your health care and education dollars.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis country is too beautiful to be beholden to the cruelty and self-interest that Jack and Trump are trying to hoist on her,\u201d she said.",
      "\u201cThe future is built on hard work and hope, and here in New Jersey, we\u2019re known for our grit, our tenacity \u2014 maybe a little bit for how loud we are \u2014 but it\u2019s going to take a strong voice to cut through the noise from Washington and deliver for the people,\u201d she said. \u201cSo I stand here tonight doing just that. And as a mom of four teenagers, you guys know I\u2019m not going to put up with the incompetent, whiny nonsense coming from aggrieved MAGA Republicans.\u201d",
      "The power and limits of money",
      "Tuesday\u2019s results showed how money matters in campaigns \u2014 and how it has its limits.",
      "On the Democratic side, Sherrill won despite having been outspent by some of her opponents whose outside groups dropped millions of dollars on the race.",
      "The largest outside spender was Working New Jersey, a super PAC funded by the state\u2019s teachers union, which Spiller leads. The group had spent a whopping $35 million on the race as of May 27, according to the latest campaign finance reports, while Spiller\u2019s campaign had spent $342,000. As of late Tuesday, Spiller had about 10% of the primary vote.",
      "Gottheimer and Fulop were also boosted by outside groups that spent millions of dollars on the airwaves. (Gottheimer drained his congressional account to fund the outside group supporting him.) Sherrill got support on the airwaves from One Giant Leap PAC, which spent less than either Gottheimer\u2019s or Fulop\u2019s groups but spent most of its funds in the final weeks of the race.",
      "Ciattarelli and an aligned outside group, Kitchen Table Conservatives, outspent the other Republicans. And Ciattarelli touted his strong fundraising as proof that he would be a formidable general election candidate."

    "summary": "This was supposed to be the 'Golden Generation' of soccer players in the U.S. But 12 months out from the World Cup, many questions remain for the national team.",
    "story": [
      "Tony Meola knows the pressure of competing in front of his home fans. Back in 1994, when the United States hosted the FIFA World Cup, Meola, the national team\u2019s starting goalkeeper, and his teammates had not one but two jobs: beat the competition and help grow the game.",
      "\u201cIt was relentless,\u201d he told NBC News. \u201cTwenty-four hours a day for a year leading into the World Cup. Promotion of the game, events. We never stopped.\u201d",
      "His team did its part off the field \u2014 the event shattered attendance records even though soccer wasn\u2019t the most popular sport at the time \u2014 and it made it out of the group stage before it lost 1-0 to eventual champion Brazil. Though it wasn\u2019t the result it wanted, that squad is credited for helping generate major interest and participation in the sport stateside.",
      "Meola had dreams of one day seeing the U.S. men\u2019s national team become perennial contenders. But more than 30 years later, with the country (along with Canada and Mexico) hosting the 2026 World Cup next June, he says there\u2019s still as much up in the air as there was two decades ago.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t feel like we\u2019re ready right now,\u201d Meola, now an analyst for CBS Sports Golazo Network, said of the current U.S. team. \u201cI want to see progression over the next year and go into [the World Cup] with as few question marks as possible, not going in there sort of fearing what\u2019s going to happen.\u201d",
      "Meola is far from the only former USMNT player to share some skepticism one year out. His co-hosts on the soccer podcast \u201cCall It What You Want,\u201d Charlie Davies and Jimmy Conrad, also expressed concern. So did Fox Sports, MLS and Apple commentator Maurice Edu.",
      "Taylor Twellman, the lead soccer analyst for Apple TV, put it more bluntly.",
      "When he was asked how the United States stacks up right now with the top countries in the world, he told NBC News: \u201cThey\u2019re not in the conversation with any of them. ... They don\u2019t see themselves as a contender.\u201d",
      "When North America was awarded the rights to the 2026 World Cup in June 2018, Carlos Cordeiro, then the president of U.S. Soccer, called it a \u201crare and important moment to demonstrate that we are all truly united through sport.\u201d",
      "It also guaranteed more eyeballs on the host countries. According to FIFA, the average global live audience for the 2022 World Cup in Qatar was 175 million viewers. The final between Argentina and France drew 1.5 billion viewers, dramatically more than the most recent Super Bowl (127.7 million).",
      "And with the 2026 World Cup final taking place at MetLife Stadium in New Jersey, this was the perfect time to showcase just how far the U.S. men\u2019s  team has come. Especially with the \u201cGolden Generation\u201d of players entering their prime.",
      "That term \u2014 attached to rising stars like Christian Pulisic, Weston McKennie, Sergi\u00f1o Dest, Gio Reyna, Timothy Weah, Antonee Robinson, Matt Turner and Tyler Adams \u2014 recognizes what was expected to be the best core in program history.",
      "They showed glimpses of brilliance during the 2022 World Cup, a run that ended in the Round of 16, but they were all young. Now, four years older, with experience both internationally and for European clubs, they are expected to help lead a deep World Cup run.",
      "But some remain hesitant to say this group can pull it off. To this point, it lacks a true signature win and has come up short in recent competitions. In last summer\u2019s Copa Am\u00e9rica, which the United States hosted, the USMNT failed to get out of the group stage after losses to Uruguay and Panama.",
      "The result raised questions about whether this roster was talented enough to get over the hump.",
      "\u201cYou can\u2019t be a \u2018Golden Generation\u2019 until you do something that hasn\u2019t been done before,\u201d Davies told NBC News.",
      "Edu said: \u201cI felt like the \u2018Golden Generation\u2019 tag was coined based on the potential. And now some of these guys are coming into their prime, so that potential has to be realized. Everything, to me, now revolves around what happens next summer.\u201d",
      "To help them reach their potential, the program moved on from longtime coach Gregg Berhalter and replaced him with Mauricio Pochettino. His hiring was seen as a huge deal, as Pochettino, who is Argentine, has managed on some of the biggest stages of world soccer: Tottenham Hotspur, Paris Saint-Germain and Chelsea.",
      "So far, the results have been mixed.",
      "He has five wins and four losses in nine games, but the team disappointed in March with two losses in the CONCACAF Nations League Finals. The team has also dropped four games in a row \u2014 including a 4-0 loss to Switzerland on Tuesday \u2014 though the lineups were far from full strength, with certain stars, like Pulisic, not playing.",
      "U.S. Soccer Sporting Director Matt Crocker said Pochettino\u2019s \u201creputation stands for itself.\u201d It\u2019s far too early in the process to critique the job he\u2019s done.",
      "\u201cWe have a great generation of young players that we want to turn potential into performance, and we couldn\u2019t have had and asked for a better coach to come in and have the ability to do that,\u201d Crocker said. \u201cNow, he just needs to have the time with the players and the games and the experiences to hopefully be ready for next summer, which is our objective.\u201d",
      "One year away from the biggest tournament in sports, the USMNT\u2019s on-field product is still far from sorted.",
      "The most important position to be decided may be goalkeeper.",
      "Turner, who started in the 2022 World Cup, is once again expected to have that role. But after a year when he played sparingly as a backup for Crystal Palace, some wonder whether his lack of playing time will have him fit for next summer. Reports this week say Turner has agreed to join the French squad Lyon.",
      "Nobody knows goalie play better than Meola, who said, \u201cThere are a lot of questions.\u201d",
      "\u201cIn general, we\u2019ve gone into World Cups either knowing who our No. 1 is or two or three guys battling for the position. That\u2019s been the rotation since 1990. This particular group, I think we\u2019re unsettled in that position,\u201d he said.",
      "If Turner gets consistent action at Lyon, he should be that guy again in 2026. Patrick Schulte, Zack Steffen and Matt Freese are the likeliest next options.",
      "Meola\u2019s other position group to watch is center back. Out wide, Robinson and Dest are near locks, but the middle of the field is still anyone\u2019s guess. Candidates include Chris Richards, Tim Ream, Mark McKenzie, Miles Robinson or Cameron Carter-Vickers.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s just too many question marks in the middle of the field at the moment,\u201d Meola said. \u201cIf I\u2019m going to focus on one, that would be it.\u201d",
      "Edu and Davies said they want to see how the next 12 months play out at center forward. The USMNT won a hard-fought battle with England to get Monaco\u2019s Folarin Balogun (who has dual citizenship), but after him there are many names to consider in Ricardo Pepi, Patrick Agyemang, Haji Wright, Damion Downs and Josh Sargent.",
      "\u201cEven if there\u2019s question marks in other positions, if we feel good about the No. 9 position, I think that gives us a hell of a chance,\u201d Edu said.",
      "Conrad is similarly focused on the middle of the field, this time at center midfield. Pochettino could go with McKennie, Yunus Musah, Johnny Cardoso, Tanner Tessman, Diego Luna or Malik Tillman.",
      "He had one prediction that might shock fans.",
      "\u201cGio Reyna ... I\u2019ll throw him in there, but at this moment I don\u2019t expect him to make the team. That\u2019s my big shock,\u201d Conrad said. \u201cI\u2019ll put my flag in the ground and say he\u2019s got a lot of work to do to get into this team for 2026, which would probably be a surprise to many, but I just think there\u2019s other players that are playing well and could fit the system a little bit better at this current moment.\u201d",
      "Even though questions abound in the middle, Conrad said he feels great outside.",
      "\u201cI would put our outside backs internationally against anybody,\u201d he said. \u201cOur strength, in terms of our starters, is Antonee Robinson, Sergi\u00f1o Dest and then into Christian Pulisic and Timothy Weah. I feel confident going up against any nation with our outside players.\u201d",
      "This summer, the USMNT has CONCACAF Gold Cup matches followed by friendlies in September, October and November. Players will then compete for their clubs, either in Major League Soccer or abroad, and then return for more friendlies before the World Cup.",
      "The final roster, capped at 26 players, will be set 10 days before the tournament.",
      "Nobody is more important in that decision than Crocker, the technical director. Previously with English club Southampton and the England national team, he\u2019s focused on getting the best product possible on the field by next June.",
      "He said questions around particular positions don\u2019t really matter because nobody is truly locked in at this point.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think that exists 12 months out from a World Cup,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re trying to build depth in the squad but also continue to monitor players\u2019 performances. We need to know who the best three players are at every position. In the build-up to a major tournament, there will always be a player that hits form; there might be a player that gets an injury. So you\u2019ve got to be ready.\u201d",
      "Twellman, a forward on the national team from 2002 to 2008, said his concerns aren\u2019t based solely on the talent level in specific position groups. It comes down to results, and the team simply hasn\u2019t gotten enough of them for him to be confident heading into a World Cup.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s just a sense of apathy around the United States men\u2019s program,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a hot take.\u201d",
      "Crocker said he has heard some of the negative discourse around the program but \u201ccan\u2019t control the outside noise.\u201d",
      "\u201cOur job, both as staff and as players, is to almost sort of look within ourselves, to continue to work as hard as we possibly can, continue to try and improve in training every day to put the performances in that we need to every day,\u201d he said. \u201cWe would love everybody to be great supporters and start to talk positively about the team, but we\u2019d also know that we have a responsibility through our performances to control that narrative, as well.\u201d"

      "The 28-year-old medical assistant was born with sickle cell disease, an inherited condition that causes red blood cells to be shaped like a crescent moon. The anomaly can cause blood clots, organ damage and excruciating pain, which can worsen during the menstrual cycle.",
      "\u201cPain-wise, I always describe it as like being hit by a Mack truck,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cWhen I know my period is coming, I know pain is probably right behind it.\u201d",
      "Over the last 10 years, Jackson has worked with her doctors to try a variety of contraception options to get her symptoms under control, from the Depo-Provera shot, a hormone injection given every three months, to an IUD to different forms of birth control pills.",
      "According to Jackson, none of them helped. Some made her periods even worse.",
      "\u201cI might have a good four or five good days of not bleeding in a month,\u201d she said. \u201cOver the years, it\u2019s like the period actually started getting heavier, and that\u2019s when it started affecting my sickle cell.\u201d",
      "At times, she\u2019s ended up in the hospital needing iron infusions due to loss of blood. Doctors don\u2019t know how to manage her symptoms. Sickle cell has no cure and treatment options are variable.",

      "Now, women like Jackson are worried that lack of knowledge, particularly about how contraception affects their conditions, could get worse.",
      "In April, a small team that compiled information into what some consider the country\u2019s \u201ccontraception bible,\u201d a set of guidelines used by physicians to assess which types of birth control are safe for their patients, was fired from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as part of mass layoffs from the agency. The eight-person team was responsible for evaluating research and recommending birth control methods for patients with various conditions, from sickle cell disease, kidney disease and lupus to those at risk for HIV.",
      "The guidelines, called the U.S. Medical Eligibility Criteria for Contraceptive Use, provided the latest research for doctors, including an app that recommended which contraceptive methods were safe.",

Without their presence, the work stops.\u201d",
      "Warner retired from the agency in April just after learning his team was being eliminated.",
      "\u201cWhile most women are able to use most methods, we looked at 60 conditions and over 1,800 evidence-based recommendations across an array of contraceptive methods,\u201d he said. \u201cFor some women, it is very dangerous for them to become pregnant at a certain point. So having contraception available to them that they can choose can help protect them.\u201d",
      "At least 90% of people in the United States with sickle cell disease are Black. The maternal mortality rate for Black sickle cell patients has been found to be 26 times higher than for non-Black people.",
      "\u201cThe CDC\u2019s decision to cut the team responsible for contraceptive guidelines is especially troubling for the sickle cell community, where pregnancy can carry severe health risks,\u201d said Teonna Woolford, who founded the nonprofit Sickle Cell Reproductive Health Education Directive to advocate for patients and expand knowledge about the often-misunderstood disease. \u201cEliminating this resource will disproportionately impact a community already facing significant barriers to care, further deepening health disparities.\u201d",
      "In response to a request for comment, an official for the Department of Health and Human Services did not explain why the team was cut.",
      "In May, Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. defended the cuts in a hearing before the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee.",
      "\u201cRight now we have 42 divisions that do maternal health,\u201d Kennedy testified. \u201cThey\u2019re not cuts. They\u2019re consolidations. It\u2019s ridiculous to have 42 divisions that are all supposed to be doing the same thing.\u201d",
      "Warner disagreed with Kennedy\u2019s testimony.",
      "\u201cEspecially with this branch,\u201d he said, \u201cthe expertise is not redundant of that elsewhere in the federal government.\u201d",
      "\u201cOnce this expertise is gone, it is permanently gone from the agency. It is going to be very hard to resume and re-create,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cThe HHS restructuring consolidates maternal and child health programs into the new Administration for a Healthy America (AHA) to improve efficiency and better address public health needs,\u201d an HHS official said in a statement to NBC News. \u201cThe reorganization aims to streamline operations, maximize resources, and support key priorities like maternal mental health and data collection. We remain committed to improving health outcomes for American families.\u201d",
      "Representatives for HHS did not specify if work on the contraception guidelines would continue. The Trump administration did not respond to questions about why the team was cut or if its work would continue.",
      "The CDC\u2019s most recent update to the contraception guidelines was published in August.",
      "The updates included new recommendations for people with sickle cell disease, finding that combined hormonal contraception presents an \u201cunacceptable health risk\u201d due to patients\u2019 risk of life-threatening blood clots.  In previous versions of the guidelines, the CDC found the advantages of combined hormonal birth control, which contains estrogen and progestin, outweighed potential risks such as blood clots or stroke. The newest guidelines also increased the risk category for the Depo-Provera shot, while ranking methods like progestin-only pills and IUDs as generally safe.",
      "Jackson was unaware of the updated guidance until her interview with NBC News.",
      "She said she is using an IUD as well as combined hormonal contraception in the form of a pill to try to manage her bleeding.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t know that,\u201d she said. \u201cI kind of just hope that my doctor knows a lot and kind of just steers me in the right direction.\u201d",
      "Warner said the CDC team should be publicizing the updated guidance now to make physicians aware of the changes and adjust how they treat patients.",
      "\u201cWe actually planned to do a road show of the guidelines in the late fall and throughout the spring in which we would disseminate the guidelines and go speak to provider groups,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not happening.\u201d",
      "The severe pain associated with her periods has driven Jackson to seek a hysterectomy for relief.",
      "\u201cI have been asking for a hysterectomy for years. I\u2019ve seen five different OBs, and no one will do it,\u201d she said.",
      "While the current guidelines are still accessible, the August update could be the last, leaving Jackson with little hope that she\u2019ll find a method of birth control that works for her.",
      "\u201cI am terrified of how health care is going to go with all of these cuts being made,\u201d she said."

      "And with the 2026 World Cup final taking place at MetLife Stadium in New Jersey, this was the perfect time to showcase just how far the U.S. men\u2019s  team has come. Especially with the \u201cGolden Generation\u201d of players entering their prime.",
      "That term \u2014 attached to rising stars like Christian Pulisic, Weston McKennie, Sergi\u00f1o Dest, Gio Reyna, Timothy Weah, Antonee Robinson, Matt Turner and Tyler Adams \u2014 recognizes what was expected to be the best core in program history.",
      "They showed glimpses of brilliance during the 2022 World Cup, a run that ended in the Round of 16, but they were all young. Now, four years older, with experience both internationally and for European clubs, they are expected to help lead a deep World Cup run.",
      "But some remain hesitant to say this group can pull it off. To this point, it lacks a true signature win and has come up short in recent competitions. In last summer\u2019s Copa Am\u00e9rica, which the United States hosted, the USMNT failed to get out of the group stage after losses to Uruguay and Panama.",
      "The result raised questions about whether this roster was talented enough to get over the hump.",
      "\u201cYou can\u2019t be a \u2018Golden Generation\u2019 until you do something that hasn\u2019t been done before,\u201d Davies told NBC News.",
      "Edu said: \u201cI felt like the \u2018Golden Generation\u2019 tag was coined based on the potential. And now some of these guys are coming into their prime, so that potential has to be realized. Everything, to me, now revolves around what happens next summer.\u201d",
      "To help them reach their potential, the program moved on from longtime coach Gregg Berhalter and replaced him with Mauricio Pochettino. His hiring was seen as a huge deal, as Pochettino, who is Argentine, has managed on some of the biggest stages of world soccer: Tottenham Hotspur, Paris Saint-Germain and Chelsea.",
      "So far, the results have been mixed.",
      "He has five wins and four losses in nine games, but the team disappointed in March with two losses in the CONCACAF Nations League Finals. The team has also dropped four games in a row \u2014 including a 4-0 loss to Switzerland on Tuesday \u2014 though the lineups were far from full strength, with certain stars, like Pulisic, not playing.",
      "U.S. Soccer Sporting Director Matt Crocker said Pochettino\u2019s \u201creputation stands for itself.\u201d It\u2019s far too early in the process to critique the job he\u2019s done.",
      "\u201cWe have a great generation of young players that we want to turn potential into performance, and we couldn\u2019t have had and asked for a better coach to come in and have the ability to do that,\u201d Crocker said. \u201cNow, he just needs to have the time with the players and the games and the experiences to hopefully be ready for next summer, which is our objective.\u201d",
      "One year away from the biggest tournament in sports, the USMNT\u2019s on-field product is still far from sorted.",
      "The most important position to be decided may be goalkeeper.",
      "Turner, who started in the 2022 World Cup, is once again expected to have that role. But after a year when he played sparingly as a backup for Crystal Palace, some wonder whether his lack of playing time will have him fit for next summer. Reports this week say Turner has agreed to join the French squad Lyon.",
      "Nobody knows goalie play better than Meola, who said, \u201cThere are a lot of questions.\u201d",
      "\u201cIn general, we\u2019ve gone into World Cups either knowing who our No. 1 is or two or three guys battling for the position. That\u2019s been the rotation since 1990. This particular group, I think we\u2019re unsettled in that position,\u201d he said.",
      "If Turner gets consistent action at Lyon, he should be that guy again in 2026. Patrick Schulte, Zack Steffen and Matt Freese are the likeliest next options.",
      "Meola\u2019s other position group to watch is center back. Out wide, Robinson and Dest are near locks, but the middle of the field is still anyone\u2019s guess. Candidates include Chris Richards, Tim Ream, Mark McKenzie, Miles Robinson or Cameron Carter-Vickers.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s just too many question marks in the middle of the field at the moment,\u201d Meola said. \u201cIf I\u2019m going to focus on one, that would be it.\u201d",
      "Edu and Davies said they want to see how the next 12 months play out at center forward. The USMNT won a hard-fought battle with England to get Monaco\u2019s Folarin Balogun (who has dual citizenship), but after him there are many names to consider in Ricardo Pepi, Patrick Agyemang, Haji Wright, Damion Downs and Josh Sargent.",
      "\u201cEven if there\u2019s question marks in other positions, if we feel good about the No. 9 position, I think that gives us a hell of a chance,\u201d Edu said.",
      "Conrad is similarly focused on the middle of the field, this time at center midfield. Pochettino could go with McKennie, Yunus Musah, Johnny Cardoso, Tanner Tessman, Diego Luna or Malik Tillman.",
      "He had one prediction that might shock fans.",
      "\u201cGio Reyna ... I\u2019ll throw him in there, but at this moment I don\u2019t expect him to make the team. That\u2019s my big shock,\u201d Conrad said. \u201cI\u2019ll put my flag in the ground and say he\u2019s got a lot of work to do to get into this team for 2026, which would probably be a surprise to many, but I just think there\u2019s other players that are playing well and could fit the system a little bit better at this current moment.\u201d",
      "Even though questions abound in the middle, Conrad said he feels great outside.",
      "\u201cI would put our outside backs internationally against anybody,\u201d he said. \u201cOur strength, in terms of our starters, is Antonee Robinson, Sergi\u00f1o Dest and then into Christian Pulisic and Timothy Weah. I feel confident going up against any nation with our outside players.\u201d",
      "This summer, the USMNT has CONCACAF Gold Cup matches followed by friendlies in September, October and November. Players will then compete for their clubs, either in Major League Soccer or abroad, and then return for more friendlies before the World Cup.",
      "The final roster, capped at 26 players, will be set 10 days before the tournament.",
      "Nobody is more important in that decision than Crocker, the technical director. Previously with English club Southampton and the England national team, he\u2019s focused on getting the best product possible on the field by next June.",
      "He said questions around particular positions don\u2019t really matter because nobody is truly locked in at this point.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think that exists 12 months out from a World Cup,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re trying to build depth in the squad but also continue to monitor players\u2019 performances. We need to know who the best three players are at every position. In the build-up to a major tournament, there will always be a player that hits form; there might be a player that gets an injury. So you\u2019ve got to be ready.\u201d",
      "Twellman, a forward on the national team from 2002 to 2008, said his concerns aren\u2019t based solely on the talent level in specific position groups. It comes down to results, and the team simply hasn\u2019t gotten enough of them for him to be confident heading into a World Cup.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s just a sense of apathy around the United States men\u2019s program,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a hot take.\u201d",
      "Crocker said he has heard some of the negative discourse around the program but \u201ccan\u2019t control the outside noise.\u201d",
      "\u201cOur job, both as staff and as players, is to almost sort of look within ourselves, to continue to work as hard as we possibly can, continue to try and improve in training every day to put the performances in that we need to every day,\u201d he said. \u201cWe would love everybody to be great supporters and start to talk positively about the team, but we\u2019d also know that we have a responsibility through our performances to control that narrative, as well.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "Rob Haskell was hoping a new rule would shield his credit report from thousands of dollars in bills for recent heart procedures. Instead, he\u2019s bracing for impact from President Donald Trump\u2019s push to slash financial regulations.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve always had medical debt hanging over me but, you know, it\u2019s just completely unmanageable,\u201d Haskell said in late May. He was speaking to NBC News from a hospital bed at PeaceHealth St. Joseph Medical Center in Bellingham, Washington, days before an open heart surgery that threatened to yield another steep bill.",
      "\u201cSo, to the moon on that one,\u201d he sighed.",
      "A lot of people don\u2019t necessarily know about the CFPB and may not understand how it\u2019s being attacked, but they will be affected.",
      "Adam Rust, consumer federation of america",
      "The 58-year-old contractor said he has battled a series of heart and kidney issues for most of his life. Despite having health insurance, his medical needs have resulted in thousands of dollars in debt.",
      "Haskell recently paid off a $5,000 bill that knocked his credit score 21 points lower \u2014 debt that might have been spared from his report under a rule instituted in the final days of the Biden-era Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. The CFPB estimated at the time that the measure would have spared $49 billion in bills from hitting the reports of 15 million people.",
      "But in April, Trump-appointed leadership at the consumer watchdog reversed its position and threw its support behind credit unions and consumer reporting companies seeking to block the rule in a Texas federal court. After twice delaying the policy\u2019s March start date, the judge is expected to rule within days.",
      "Haskell used some retirement savings to pay off his last operation, in 2024. Before his heart surgery last month, he\u2019d hoped the medical debt rule would finally help smooth out his finances, boost his credit score above 700, and improve his chances of buying property to build a home. That now appears unlikely.",
      "\u201cThere really was very little information about the whole thing,\u201d Haskell said of the CFPB\u2019s about-face. \u201cI was really surprised.\u201d",
      "The change adds to the financial risks consumers increasingly face from months of cuts and policy rollbacks at the agency, advocates say, contributing to broader economic uncertainty stoked by Trump\u2019s trade war. Since January, CFPB leadership has attempted to fire nearly all of the agency\u2019s 1,700 workers, halted standard supervisory and enforcement actions and blocked rules aimed at buttressing consumers\u2019 wallets.",
      "The actions have stunned consumer advocates who just months ago had expected at least some of the Biden-era guidance to remain untouched. Some pointed to the populist economic message that propelled Trump back into the Oval Office, even though the CFPB \u2014 itself a byproduct of populist frustrations churned up by the 2008 financial crisis \u2014 has drawn GOP ire since its inception.",
      "\u201cThese rules generally are very politically popular,\u201d said Chi Chi Wu, a senior attorney at the National Consumer Law Center, a nonprofit group that stepped in to defend both the medical debt rule and a separate one capping overdraft fees at large banks at $5. The latter measure was voided in early May when Trump signed House Republicans\u2019 resolution repealing it. When federal agencies\u2019 policies are nullified under the Congressional Review Act, they\u2019re prevented from issuing substantially similar ones in the future.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re actively harming regular, hard-working Americans so that their billionaire buddies can profit,\u201d Wu said of administration officials. \u201cThere\u2019s really no other way to look at it.\u201d",
      "Spokespeople for the CFPB and the White House didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.",
      "The Trump administration has cast its changes as efforts to combat government overreach. In remarks to the American Bankers Association in April, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who was appointed acting director of the CFPB in late January, described Biden-era rules as politically biased and criticized their \u201ccompliance costs\u201d that could impede \u201cresponsible lending and risk-taking.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe associated mission drift can lend itself to political ends,\u201d he said at the time.",
      "The consumer banking industry has applauded efforts to rein in the agency.",
      "\u201cHow do we take politics out of regulation, where it never should have been?\u201d Lindsey Johnson, president and CEO of the Consumer Bankers Association, said at a recent industry event. She also thanked Trump in a statement last month cheering the elimination of the overdraft rule \u201cfor protecting consumer choice and access to a deeply valued financial tool utilized by millions of Americans in times of need.\u201d",
      "Republican policymakers, both at the CFPB and in Congress, have taken steps to unwind other recent financial regulations.",
      "In April, a Biden-era rule capping most credit card late fees at $8 was eliminated. So was a policy aimed at tightening regulations around the sale of consumers\u2019 financial data and Social Security numbers. The CFPB has also abandoned a lawsuit against the three big banks that operate the digital payments platform Zelle, which was accused of mishandling users\u2019 fraud complaints totaling more than $870 million since 2017.",
      "Gone, too, are oversight powers over big tech companies offering payment tools and plans to hold Buy Now, Pay Later services \u2014 which have rapidly become many consumers\u2019 default choice of credit \u2014 to the same regulations as card issuers.",
      "\u201cA lot of people don\u2019t necessarily know about the CFPB and may not understand how it\u2019s being attacked, but they will be affected,\u201d said Adam Rust, director of financial services at the Consumer Federation of America. \u201cPartisanship is what is driving these actions, both by Congress and the CFPB, and it strikes me as an inside-the-Beltway game that ignores the effect on regular people.\u201d",
      "In the meantime, some advocates are shifting focus to state and municipal safeguards. New York City Comptroller Brad Lander published a report this week outlining how the city and the state can fill the void left by a CFPB \u201cin crisis,\u201d recommending a consumer restitution fund and bank overdraft caps. In January, California instituted its own prohibitions on health care providers and debt collectors from reporting medical debt to credit agencies.",
      "Still, Armen Meyer, a financial policy consultant who has served as both a fintech executive and a bank regulator, said he expects \u201cmany, many consumers will be harmed no matter how much the states stand up.\u201d",
      "When you\u2019re broke, you\u2019re broke. You just do what you can to survive.",
      "George Curlee, Garland, Texas",
      "George Curlee, 51, is keenly aware of how the CFPB\u2019s policy reversals threaten his finances.",
      "In 2023, the Garland, Texas, resident underwent an emergency toe amputation that resulted in $61,000 in total medical debt despite the insurance he\u2019d purchased on an Affordable Care Act marketplace. Around the same time, he was fired from his retail job and his credit score plunged 60 points.",
      "Curlee said he has since managed to whittle the debt down to about $50,000 and found part-time work in March. The job pays less than half his previous $40,000 annual salary, and he\u2019s been living with two of his brothers to save money.",
      "\u201cWhen you\u2019re broke, you\u2019re broke,\u201d he said. \u201cYou just do what you can to survive.\u201d",
      "Curlee now fears worse to come because of House Republicans\u2019 so-called Big Beautiful Bill, which the Congressional Budget Office estimates would push at least 16 million people off health insurance by 2034 \u2014 including those who pay for ACA coverage like him. He has since joined advocates to lobby policymakers against the proposed cuts and in favor of preserving the medical debt rule.",
      "\u201cI really wish that politicians would take the politics out of these bills and do what\u2019s right for the American people,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a little insane.\u201d"

      "\u201cPain-wise, I always describe it as like being hit by a Mack truck,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cWhen I know my period is coming, I know pain is probably right behind it.\u201d",
      "Over the last 10 years, Jackson has worked with her doctors to try a variety of contraception options to get her symptoms under control, from the Depo-Provera shot, a hormone injection given every three months, to an IUD to different forms of birth control pills.",
      "According to Jackson, none of them helped. Some made her periods even worse.",
      "\u201cI might have a good four or five good days of not bleeding in a month,\u201d she said. \u201cOver the years, it\u2019s like the period actually started getting heavier, and that\u2019s when it started affecting my sickle cell.\u201d",
      "At times, she\u2019s ended up in the hospital needing iron infusions due to loss of blood. Doctors don\u2019t know how to manage her symptoms. Sickle cell has no cure and treatment options are variable.",

      "In April, a small team that compiled information into what some consider the country\u2019s \u201ccontraception bible,\u201d a set of guidelines used by physicians to assess which types of birth control are safe for their patients, was fired from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as part of mass layoffs from the agency. The eight-person team was responsible for evaluating research and recommending birth control methods for patients with various conditions, from sickle cell disease, kidney disease and lupus to those at risk for HIV.",
      "The guidelines, called the U.S. Medical Eligibility Criteria for Contraceptive Use, provided the latest research for doctors, including an app that recommended which contraceptive methods were safe.",
      "The app has been downloaded more than 440,000 times, according to the CDC.",
      "Now, the work of that team has been halted as part of the reduction of the Women\u2019s Health and Fertility Branch of the Division of Reproductive Health.",
      "\u201cThese are the only federal guidelines that focus on the safety of contraception for women with certain medical conditions,\u201d said Lee Warner, the former chief of the Women\u2019s Health and Fertility Branch. \u201cThis work exists nowhere else, and these individuals specialize in this area. Without their presence, the work stops.\u201d",
      "Warner retired from the agency in April just after learning his team was being eliminated.",
      "\u201cWhile most women are able to use most methods, we looked at 60 conditions and over 1,800 evidence-based recommendations across an array of contraceptive methods,\u201d he said. \u201cFor some women, it is very dangerous for them to become pregnant at a certain point. So having contraception available to them that they can choose can help protect them.\u201d",
      "At least 90% of people in the United States with sickle cell disease are Black. The maternal mortality rate for Black sickle cell patients has been found to be 26 times higher than for non-Black people.",
      "\u201cThe CDC\u2019s decision to cut the team responsible for contraceptive guidelines is especially troubling for the sickle cell community, where pregnancy can carry severe health risks,\u201d said Teonna Woolford, who founded the nonprofit Sickle Cell Reproductive Health Education Directive to advocate for patients and expand knowledge about the often-misunderstood disease. \u201cEliminating this resource will disproportionately impact a community already facing significant barriers to care, further deepening health disparities.\u201d",

In previous versions of the guidelines, the CDC found the advantages of combined hormonal birth control, which contains estrogen and progestin, outweighed potential risks such as blood clots or stroke. The newest guidelines also increased the risk category for the Depo-Provera shot, while ranking methods like progestin-only pills and IUDs as generally safe.",
      "Jackson was unaware of the updated guidance until her interview with NBC News.",

    "story": [
      "BUENOS AIRES, Argentina \u2014 Argentina\u2019s highest court upheld a six-year prison sentence for former President Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner in a ruling Tuesday that permanently banned her from public office over the corruption conviction that found she had directed state contracts to a friend while she was the first lady and president.",
      "The explosive Supreme Court ruling left Fern\u00e1ndez, Argentina\u2019s charismatic yet deeply divisive ex-leader, subject to arrest and sent her supporters pouring into the streets of Buenos Aires, Argentina\u2019s capital, and blocking major highways in protest.",
      "The court asked Argentina\u2019s security ministry to set up a detention center to hold 72-year-old Fern\u00e1ndez. Her defense lawyer Carlos Beraldi told C5N, a television station in Buenos Aires, that he had requested Fern\u00e1ndez be allowed to serve her sentence in house arrest given her age.",
      "The ruling bars Fern\u00e1ndez from running in this fall\u2019s Buenos Aires legislative elections just days after she launched her campaign.",
      "Fern\u00e1ndez \u2014 who dominated Argentine politics for two decades and forged the country\u2019s main left-wing populist movement known as Kirchnerism, after her and her husband, former President N\u00e9stor Kirchner \u2014 rejects the charges as politically motivated.",
      "During Fern\u00e1ndez\u2019s eight years in office (2007\u20132015), Argentina expanded cash payments to the poor and pioneered major social assistance programs. But her governments funded the unbridled state spending by printing money, bringing Argentina notoriety for massive budget deficits and sky-high inflation.",
      "Critics blamed Argentina\u2019s years of economic volatility on Fern\u00e1ndez\u2019s policies, and outrage over successive economic crises and the country\u2019s bloated bureaucracy helped vault radical libertarian President Javier Milei to the presidency in late 2023.",
      "The ruling dealt a severe blow to Milei\u2019s opposition during a crucial midterm election year. He celebrated the ruling, writing on social media: \u201cJustice. Period.\u201d",
      "Fern\u00e1ndez was embroiled in multiple corruption scandals during her tenure. She was convicted in 2022 in this corruption case, which centered on 51 public contracts for public works awarded to companies linked to L\u00e1zaro B\u00e1ez, a convicted construction magnate and friend of the presidential couple, at prices 20% above the standard rate in a scheme that cost the state tens of millions of dollars.",
      "The high court rejected Fern\u00e1ndez\u2019s request for the court to review her prison sentence in March. In a resolution obtained by The Associated Press, the court said that the prison sentence \u201cdoes nothing more than to protect our republican and democratic system.\u201d",
      "The Kirchner governments carried out \u201can extraordinary fraudulent maneuver\u201d that harmed the interests of the government and resulted in the embezzlement of roughly $70 million at the current exchange rate, the resolution said.",
      "Supporters of Fern\u00e1ndez and her political movement blocked main roads into Buenos Aires and stormed the offices of Argentina\u2019s two main cable networks that are widely considered critical of the ex-leader, Channel 13 and Todos Noticias, smashing televisions, vandalizing cars and shattering windows. There were no injuries reported.",
      "Fern\u00e1ndez rejected the decision, calling the court justices \u201cpuppets\u201d of those wielding economic power in the country.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re three puppets answering to those ruling far above them,\u201d she told supporters in a rousing speech outside her party\u2019s headquarters. \u201cIt\u2019s not the opposition. It\u2019s the concentrated economic power of Argentina\u2019s government.\u201d",
      "Gregorio Dalb\u00f3n, one of Fern\u00e1ndez\u2019s lawyers, vowed \u201cto take this case to all international human rights organizations.\u201d",
      "Fern\u00e1ndez has questioned the impartiality of the judges. She claims her defense didn\u2019t have access to much of the evidence and that it was gathered without regard to legal deadlines.",
      "Fern\u00e1ndez faces a series of other upcoming trials on corruption charges."

    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 Donald Trump is getting the parade he wanted showcasing America\u2019s military power \u2014 but he\u2019ll also be getting mass protests exposing the nation\u2019s partisan divisions.",
      "The tanks and artillery launchers rolling through Washington on Saturday will honor the Army\u2019s 250th anniversary, which falls on the day Trump turns 79.",
      "About 7,000 soldiers will march. Hundreds of thousands of people are expected to line up along Constitution Avenue on the co-birthdays and cheer. Trump is set to watch the spectacle from a viewing stand south of the White House.",
      "But in Washington and in all 50 states, organizers will be staging protests that could dwarf the parade in size. A coalition of pro-democracy, labor and liberal activists is arranging a full day of counterprogramming to make the case that Trump is hijacking the Army celebration to venerate himself.",
      "\u201cThe goal here is to deprive Trump of what he wants in this moment, which is a story about him being the all-powerful political figure of our time, and instead create a contrast with normal, everyday people demonstrating that power in this country still resides with the people,\u201d said Ezra Levin, a co-founder of the progressive group Indivisible, who is helping organize what participants have dubbed a nationwide \u201cNo Kings\u201d demonstration.",
      "If past protests are a guide, the participants could number in the millions, he said. A total of 1,800 rallies are expected, with events in each congressional district, he added.",
      "Another group called Women\u2019s March is also arranging protests to coincide with the parade, with a theme of \u201cKick Out the Clowns.\u201d Organizers expect up to 5,000 people to participate in Madison, Wisconsin, alone, said Tamika Middleton, chief political and strategy officer of Women\u2019s March.",
      "\u201cNothing feels more absurd than the idea of this president having a massive military parade on his birthday,\u201d she said. \"It feels surreal for many of us.\u201d",
      "NBC News reached out to the White House for comment.",
      "On Tuesday, Rand Paul of Kentucky became the first Senate Republican to criticize the parade, citing the imagery. Showing off lethal hardware is something other countries do, not the United States, he said.",
      "\u201cI wouldn\u2019t have done it,\" Paul told reporters. He added that \"we were always different than the images you saw in the Soviet Union and North Korea. We were proud not to be that.\"",
      "Trump isn't deterred. Speaking in the Oval Office on Tuesday, he warned that protesters this weekend will face \"very big force.\"  He didn't distinguish between those who demonstrate peacefully or violently.",
      "\"And I haven\u2019t even heard about a protest,\" Trump added, \"but you know, this is people that hate our country. But they will be met with very heavy force.\" (At a news briefing this week, a Secret Service official said thousands of agents and officers will be on hand to provide security.)",
      "The parade is happening at a fraught moment when Trump has drawn the military \u2014 among the nation\u2019s most trusted institutions \u2014 into a tense standoff in Los Angeles over his aggressive efforts to deport people living in the United States illegally. The Trump administration this week activated about 700 Marines to help quell demonstrations over his immigration enforcement methods, despite warnings from California officials that he is inflaming the situation.",
      "The military\u2019s main purpose is to fight and win foreign wars, and it has largely retained its reputation as an apolitical body carrying out a national mission. Only in rare instances has the nation held military parades: The last one took place 34 years ago after the United States defeated Iraq in the first Gulf War.",
      "Saturday will open with a festival on the National Mall. Soldiers will be on hand to meet people and take part in special military demonstrations.",
      "The parade will start at 6:30 p.m. ET and follow Constitution Avenue from near the Lincoln Memorial to the Ellipse south of the White House. Workers have been laying down steel plates to protect the roads from the heavy tanks. Bradley Fighting Vehicles will also be on display, while dozens of helicopters will take part in a flyover. At the Senate Armed Services hearing last Thursday, Army Secretary Daniel Driscoll put the cost at $25 million to $40 million.",
      "Driscoll justified the expense as a \u201conce-in-a-lifetime opportunity to fill up our recruiting pipeline with young Americans.\u201d",
      "Trump told NBC News in May that the cost was \"peanuts compared to the value.\"",
      "\u201cWe have the greatest missiles in the world. We have the greatest submarines in the world. We have the greatest Army tanks in the world. We have the greatest weapons in the world. And we\u2019re going to celebrate it,\u201d he said in an interview with \"Meet the Press.\"",
      "Some military experts echoed that sentiment, seeing merit in an event that gives Americans a chance to thank their soldiers and see them up close.",
      "\u201cOnly 9% of young Americans have an inclination toward military service,\u201d said Kori Schake, who has worked at both the Defense Department and the White House National Security Council. \u201cAnd so, exposing more Americans to our Army, where kids can talk to soldiers about their experience, is good for the country.\u201d",
      "Others said the money is being wasted. A better idea would be to restore programs serving veterans or rehiring some of those who lost their jobs in the Trump administration\u2019s effort to shrink the government workforce, some lawmakers and veterans groups said.",
      "Department of Government Efficiency cuts have fallen heavily on veterans, who make up a disproportionate share of the federal workforce. Meanwhile, the Veterans Affairs Department cut a program that provides mortgage assistance to veterans so they don\u2019t face foreclosure on their homes.",
      "The mortgage program \u201chelped tens of thousands of veterans stay in their homes. And they want to spend $50 million on a parade?\u201d said Chris Purdy, who heads the Chamberlain Network, a pro-veterans group. \u201cIt really shows this is about an individual\u2019s pride and not the nation\u2019s pride.\u201d",
      "Rep. Adam Smith, D-Wash., a member of the House Armed Services Committee, criticized the parade's price tag in an interview.",
      "\"The military is being required to spend resources and time on this, instead of training and preparing to meet the national security needs of the country,\" he said, adding, \u201cIt\u2019s a horrible idea.\"",
      "Trump has long championed a military parade. In 2017, he attended the Bastille Day ceremony in Paris with French President Emmanuel Macron and got a firsthand look as tanks rumbled past the reviewing stand.",
      "The trip left an impression. After he returned to the White House, Trump spoke often about holding a similar parade at home, a former White House official said. Aides delayed and diverted him, mentioning the potential cost and telling him the United States didn't make a point of flaunting its hardware, the person said.",
      "\u201cCertainly, the French do it a lot and the North Koreans do it a lot and the Russians, but we don\u2019t really tend to do those things,\u201d the former official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.",
      "\u201cHe brought it up quite a bit,\u201d the person continued.",
      "In his Oval Office remarks, Trump didn't mention the parade in the context of his birthday. He noted instead that the day is Flag Day.",
      "\"We\u2019re going to have a fantastic June 14th parade, Flag Day,\" he said. \"It\u2019s going to be an amazing day. We have tanks, we have planes, we have all sorts of things. And I think it\u2019s going to be great. We\u2019re going to celebrate our country for a change.\"",
      "Whether the day comes off as a tribute to the Army or to Trump hinges on how Trump behaves in the moment, analysts said.",
      "\u201cThe degree to which this is a violation of norms depends in part on what the president says and does on the margins of this event,\u201d said Peter Feaver, a Duke University political science professor who has written about the military\u2019s relationship with political leaders.",
      "In the run-up to the parade, Trump is capitalizing on the Army's milestone birthday in partisan terms. Speaking Tuesday at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, he took aim at various Democratic foes, including the last commander in chief, Joe Biden. He invoked Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass, another Democrat, eliciting boos from the audience.",
      "Mentioning Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, the Democratic vice presidential nominee last year, Trump said: \"I think he's running for president, but he's a radical lunatic.\"",
      "Linking the military to the sitting president\u2019s birthday and sending it into the streets to confront fellow Americans risk tarnishing its credibility while pushing the country away from its democratic roots, Trump's critics warn.",
      "\u201cDisplays of hardware, whether its tanks or Stryker vehicles, is more characteristic of totalitarian militaristic states like North Korea or Russia,\u201d said Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, who questioned the event\u2019s cost at a recent hearing with Army leaders. \u201cAnd they are used in part to glorify the dictator in those countries. This parade falls on President Trump\u2019s birthday and is as much a celebration of his birthday and him \u2014 at least it\u2019s designed to be \u2014 as it is our Army.\u201d"

    "summary": "The moves by Gavin Newsom, JB Pritzker and Tim Walz \u2014 all potential 2028 presidential contenders \u2014 have angered some progressives and immigrants' advocates.",
    "story": [
      "A trio of states with Democratic governors viewed as potential 2028 presidential candidates have taken steps in recent weeks to freeze or cut government-funded health care coverage for undocumented immigrants.",
      "Democratic Govs. Gavin Newsom of California, JB Pritzker of Illinois and Tim Walz of Minnesota have largely attributed the proposals to budget shortfalls stemming from original plans to expand health care to immigrants without legal status.",
      "But the moves also occur against the backdrop of broader debate within the Democratic Party over how to handle immigration, an issue that dragged it down in the last election and that President Donald Trump and the GOP have continued to try to capitalize on.",
      "The plans, which would scale back health care coverage for undocumented immigrants in the three Democratic-led states just years after it was expanded, have angered progressives and immigrant advocacy groups, who warn the party risks alienating its base \u2014 particularly as protests against Trump's deportation plans break out around the country.",
      "The latest development came in Minnesota on Tuesday, after both chambers of the Legislature passed a bill to end state-funded health care for undocumented adults.",
      "The bipartisan effort advanced through the Republican-controlled House and the Democratic-controlled Senate as part of attempts to balance the state budget. It now goes to Walz, who has said he\u2019ll sign it.",
      "The bill would end undocumented adults\u2019 eligibility for MinnesotaCare \u2014 the state-funded health insurance program for low-income residents \u2014 effectively reversing one of the signature policy wins Walz secured during a landmark legislative session in 2023, when Democrats were in full control of state government. Undocumented children would remain eligible to enroll in the program under the legislation.",
      "In California, Newsom unveiled a budget plan last month that would cut back on health care benefits for undocumented immigrants \u2014 a stark reversal from his promises of universal health care for all the state's residents, regardless of their immigration status.",
      "Newsom\u2019s plan in his 2025-26 budget has called for freezing enrollment for undocumented adults to receive the full scope of the state\u2019s Medicaid program, known as Medi-Cal. Newsom\u2019s office has said the changes would apply only to new applicants over age 19, that existing enrollees wouldn\u2019t be kicked off their plans and that the freeze, which would begin next year, wouldn\u2019t apply to people enrolled in limited plans.",
      "Newsom\u2019s proposed changes also included a new $100 monthly premium for adults 19 and older with \u201cunsatisfactory immigration status\u201d beginning in 2027.",
      "His expansion of Medi-Cal has cost far more than his administration anticipated. Newsom has said the changes will help to balance the state\u2019s budget, which has run a multibillion-dollar shortfall that he has blamed on Trump\u2019s tariffs, as well as growing costs from higher enrollment in Medi-Cal.",
      "Meanwhile, Illinois remains on track by the end of the month to end a program \u2014 called Health Benefits for Immigrant Adults \u2014 that provides state-funded health care coverage for more than 30,000 low-income adults who are living in the state without documentation.",
      "Similarly, the program in Illinois was more expensive than expected when it was created in 2021. Pritzker\u2019s latest budget, which the Democratic-led Legislature passed last month, proposed eliminating it by July 1.",
      "While the moves would help those states recalibrate their budgets, a sweeping Trump-backed domestic policy bill moving through Congress proposes slashing Medicaid funding for states that provide health care coverage to undocumented immigrants. Trump also signed an executive order this year targeting undocumented immigrants' access to government assistance programs.",
      "In response to questions from NBC News, Newsom spokesperson Elana Ross reiterated his statement in his initial announcement of the changes last month that \u201cinstead of rolling back the program \u2014 meaning cutting people off for basic care \u2014 we\u2019re capping it.\u201d",
      "Pritzker\u2019s office said in an email that \u201cthis year, passing a balanced budget required the difficult decision that reflects the reality of Trump and Republicans tanking our national economy and attempting to strip away healthcare.\u201d",
      "A Walz spokesperson didn\u2019t respond to questions about Minnesota's plan, which was the result of a compromise after Republican lawmakers had pushed to end the entire MinnesotaCare program.",
      "\u201cNo one got everything they wanted,\u201d Walz said last month after he reached a tentative deal with Republicans on the budget, which was finalized in a special session this week. \u201cThere were very difficult conversations about issues that were very dear to each of these caucuses. But at the end of the day, we were able to come to this agreement.\u201d",
      "Blowback from the left",
      "Immigrant advocacy groups have panned the moves, saying they risk further imperiling the broader health care system, and blasted Democrats for succumbing to Trump's attacks.",
      "\u201cWe urge state leaders to build on their progress, rather than placing the health of their residents at risk,\u201d said Tanya Broder, the senior counsel for health and economic justice policy at the National Immigration Law Center. \u201cParticularly as extremist politicians scapegoat and target immigrants, we are counting on state officials to do the right thing and hold the line.",
      "\u201cAs states increasingly have recognized, a community\u2019s health and well-being depend on ensuring that everyone has access to health care. Immigrants pay billions of dollars in federal, state and local taxes, yet many are excluded from critical health care programs,\u201d she added. \u201cTerminating state coverage for immigrants will compromise our collective health, as well as the health care infrastructure that serves all of us.\u201d",
      "Some progressives questioned whether the moves were part of a broader strategy by the three governors to move to the right on the broader issue of immigration, which polling has shown still remains one of Trump\u2019s strongest issues.",
      "They said they could face a backlash from their base by departing from positions on supporting immigrant communities and expanding health care.",
      "\u201cIt really feeds into the conservative narrative that undocumented immigrants are a drain on our communities,\u201d said Jennifer Driver, a senior director at the State Innovation Exchange, a progressive legislative policy group. \u201cThis assumption that by moving more to the middle or to the right that you\u2019re going to recruit some people back \u2014 I think it\u2019s a miscalculation.",
      "\u201cThe frustration that you\u2019re seeing in the Democratic base is due to this kind of this waffling, this kind of idea that \u2018OK, yes, we are progressive \u2014 but only in some moments,\u2019\u201d Driver added.",
      "Other strategists suggested it remained too early to gauge whether a broader shift was in play as governors and other lawmakers positioned themselves for potential 2028 White House bids, and they emphasized that the threats blue states face from Trump are serious.",
      "\u201cThe Trump administration is squeezing the hell out of states,\u201d said Jeff Blodgett, a Minnesota-based Democratic strategist who was a campaign manager for the late Sen. Paul Wellstone and the state director for both of Barack Obama\u2019s presidential campaigns. \u201cThere\u2019s just a lot of concern about current and future budgets given what the federal government is doing to states.\u201d"

    "published": "Wed, 11 Jun 2025 09:00:00 GMT",
    "summary": "Sen. Elissa Slotkin has stepped onto the national stage with a \"war plan\" against Trump \u2014 taking a more confrontational approach than Gov. Gretchen Whitmer has.",
    "story": [
      "LANSING, Mich. \u2014 As she spoke Friday night in the high school gymnasium where Magic Johnson starred as a prep basketball player, Sen. Elissa Slotkin, D-Mich., reached for a football analogy while wrestling with the existential questions facing the Democratic Party.",
      "\u201cWe know the Lions are going to the Super Bowl this year because they have a good defense and a good offense, right?\u201d Slotkin, referring to Detroit\u2019s NFL team, told an audience of roughly 400 people at a town hall forum.",
      "\u201cSo we have to be able to do both,\u201d Slotkin added. \u201cWe have a strong defense, but then you\u2019ve got to have a vision, an alternative vision, to what is being provided to us every day. And that is the charge of the next generation of leaders in the Democratic Party.\u201d",
      "Slotkin narrowly won her Senate seat last year, prevailing in a competitive state that backed Donald Trump for president. Almost instantly, given her against-the-current victory and Midwest perch, Slotkin became a go-to voice for a party struggling with its identity. She delivered the Democratic response to Trump\u2019s joint address to Congress in March.",
      "She also has thrown herself into advocating for a robust takedown of the president\u2019s agenda.",
      "\u201cI wrote a war plan,\u201d the former CIA analyst and Pentagon aide told her audience here last week, \u201cof how to contain and defeat Trump \u2014 a 17-page PowerPoint.\u201d",
      "The town hall put Slotkin in her old congressional district, but the content was consistent with a message that she has been testing nationally. And by advancing her \u201calternative vision,\u201d Slotkin is establishing herself as another Democratic officeholder in Michigan who could emerge as a White House contender in 2028, along with Gov. Gretchen Whitmer.",
      "Whitmer, a subject of presidential speculation for years, remains popular with voters in a state that was placed near the front of last year\u2019s primary calendar. Unlike Slotkin, she has taken a less confrontational approach toward Trump in his second term.",
      "Those familiar with Slotkin\u2019s rise stress that her Senate campaign should not be viewed as some grand plan to quickly build a higher profile and set up a run for president. But a Democratic strategist who has worked on Michigan races believes that it\u2019s something she will at least consider.",
      "\u201cThe way she thinks of it is, this party is on the precipice of full-on collapse,\u201d said this person, who like others was granted anonymity to talk about a fluid situation and discuss sensitive intraparty dynamics ahead of 2028. \u201cCircumstances have just sort of pushed her into this.\u201d",
      "Slotkin rolled her eyes and briskly sidestepped when asked in an interview if people have been encouraging her to consider running for president in 2028.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m about to go out in front of 1,000 people who think that they\u2019re going to lose their health care,\u201d she told NBC News before her town hall at Everett High School. \u201cI am focused on, literally, saving them from losing their health care and their food. And I get it. I know it\u2019s a good parlor conversation. It\u2019s just, honest to God, not where my head is focused right now. It\u2019s just not.\u201d",
      "Whitmer's way",
      "Whitmer was a finalist to be Joe Biden\u2019s vice presidential running mate in 2020, having positioned herself at the time as a prominent foil for Trump and a critic of his pandemic management. Whitmer also was on a short list of Democratic governors and senators who were seen as potential replacements for Biden on the ticket last year before then-Vice President Kamala Harris sewed up the nomination.",
      "Spokespeople for Whitmer did not respond to requests to interview the governor for this article. Two Democratic operatives who have worked with her said it is unclear to them what her intentions are for 2028 and would not be surprised if she were to pass on a run.",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s a huge open question,\u201d one of the operatives said. \u201cWhat people who don\u2019t know her miss is that she\u2019s a super-regular person who likes hanging out at the lake and drinking beer and hanging out with her dogs and husband.\u201d",
      "Although the term-limited Whitmer has not made definitive plans, many of her recent moves as governor have been viewed through the prism of national politics. She has made public overtures to Trump, meeting with him at the White House and working with him on issues important to Michigan.",
      "Whitmer\u2019s way has been rewarded on one level. Trump announced a new fighter jet mission for an endangered air base in her state and committed his administration\u2019s support to combat Asian carp, a Great Lakes nuisance. On the latter issue, the White House even took a shot at Democratic Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, a potential Whitmer primary rival in 2028 whom the Trump administration characterized as a hindrance to mitigating the ecological impact of the invasive fish.",
      "But Whitmer\u2019s courtship also has put her crosswise with other Democrats who find her too accommodating of Trump. After one of her White House meetings in April, Whitmer joined Trump for a photo opportunity in the Oval Office, where the president announced investigations of two political adversaries and repeated his debunked claim that the 2020 election was stolen from him. Adding to Whitmer\u2019s political troubles that day was a New York Times photographer who documented the governor \u2014 who later acknowledged she did not want her picture taken there \u2014 hiding her face behind blue folders.",
      "Whitmer\u2019s team has taken comfort in internal and independent polling since then that has shown that a majority of Michigan voters approve of her job performance as governor.",
      "\u201cFrom her perspective, I think it\u2019s, \u2018I\u2019m going to do as good a job as I can for the people in my state, and the political benefits will follow,\u2019 as opposed to others who are taking different approaches by showing up in New Hampshire and South Carolina,\u201d two states typically at the front of the primary calendar, said another operative who has worked with Whitmer. \u201cAre they as focused on their states as they should be? Will they have a set of accomplishments?\u201d",
      "In a presidential primary debate, this person added, \u201call she has to do is throw in a couple of places where she\u2019s held Trump\u2019s feet to the fire and stood up to him. Yeah, she took some s---, but she\u2019s positioned herself well to make a pretty compelling argument that she got some really important stuff for her state that at the end of the day made her a great governor.\u201d",
      "Michigan Democratic Party Chairman Curtis Hertel, who served in the Legislature during Whitmer\u2019s first term as governor, praised her for working across the aisle but also for championing new gun-safety laws and a repeal of the state\u2019s anti-union \u201cright-to-work\u201d law.",
      "\u201cToo often we find labels and differences in places where there aren\u2019t,\u201d Hertel said in an interview. \u201cIt\u2019s incredibly important that we\u2019re pushing back and fighting back and all those things. That doesn\u2019t mean there aren\u2019t places of agreement where we can work with each other. That\u2019s part of being a successful public servant. \u2026 So I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a binary choice, and I think that our leaders in Michigan understand that, and I think that\u2019s how they\u2019re behaving.\u201d",
      "Slotkin calling 'balls and strikes'",
      "Slotkin has used her bully pulpit as a newly elected senator to push back on Trump more.",
      "\u201cI think for me,\u201d she said in the interview, reaching for another sports metaphor, \u201cit\u2019s just call balls and strikes on what he\u2019s proposing and what it\u2019s going to do to your business, your life, your family. You don\u2019t have to overhype what\u2019s happening, but don\u2019t underhype it, either.\u201d",
      "Slotkin also has a calling card Whitmer doesn\u2019t: She has twice won tough elections \u2014 her first House re-election bid in 2020, and last year\u2019s Senate race \u2014 with Trump on the top of the ticket. (A third Michigan Democrat who could run in 2028, former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, lives in the state but has never won an election there and is associated more with Indiana, where he was the mayor of South Bend.)",
      "\u201cGretchen,\u201d said the strategist who has worked on Michigan races, \u201chas only had to run statewide in two cycles good for Democrats, and never on the ballot the same year as Trump. It\u2019s a completely different dynamic.\u201d",
      "One of the operatives who has worked with Whitmer characterized the differences between her and Slotkin as minor nuances.",
      "\u201cThe No. 1 similarity, which is probably more important than all of those smaller discrepancies, is that they\u2019re tough women,\u201d this person added.",
      "During Friday\u2019s town hall, during which members of a heavily Democratic audience read aloud questions they had submitted in advance, Slotkin shared a stage with Hertel and Rep. Kristen McDonald Rivet, who won her seat last year in a competitive, neighboring district. Slotkin\u2019s old district, now represented by Republican Tom Barrett, is the type of place where they are hoping to rally discouraged Democrats.",
      "Questions ranged from concerns about spending cuts and Trump\u2019s massive domestic policy bill to a fear that the president could declare martial law to postpone future elections \u2014 an unsubstantiated theory percolating on the political left. Slotkin validated their worries with calls to action.",
      "\u201cThe president has made comments that are real close to martial law,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s talked about sending the National Guard into our cities. We need to listen when he says things.\u201d",
      "The next day, Trump deployed the National Guard to the Los Angeles area to counter protests against immigration raids, ignoring the wishes of California Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat.",
      "Slotkin also pressed the audience to engage Republicans, noting how she invited her township supervisor, a Republican, to join her at Trump\u2019s inauguration in January.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve got to have these conversations, not just with them, but with those folks who just kind of can\u2019t stand politics either way,\u201d Slotkin said. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to like politics right now. Most of you probably don\u2019t like it. You just do it because you love your country.\u201d"

      "The president wants U.S. firms to \u201ceat\u201d the cost of his tariffs. Fresh price-growth data will show whether he\u2019s getting his wish.",
      "The monthly inflation report set to be released Wednesday by the Bureau of Labor Statistics is expected to provide the most definitive look yet at whether U.S. companies are passing the cost of President Donald Trump's higher import duties on to customers.",
      "And there\u2019s some anticipation that inflation has ticked up. The Consumer Price Index, which tracks changes in prices for consumer goods and services, is forecast to show a 12-month increase of 2.4% in May, compared with a 2.3% annual pace in April, according to a survey by Dow Jones Newswires.",
      "\u201cCore\u201d inflation, a measure closely watched by economists that excludes prices for food and energy, which tend to fluctuate more, is expected to rise 2.9% over the year, up from 2.8% in April. The core month-on-month reading was expected to climb to 0.3% from 0.2% in April.",
      "The president\u2019s on-again, off-again tariffs and trade-deal announcements have scrambled the spending plans of businesses and consumers. As a result, sentiment surveys have shown deteriorating confidence since April, when Trump rolled out his \u201cLiberation Day\u201d tariffs that reset the base U.S. import duty level to 10%.",
      "Trump campaigned on promises to bring price relief to Americans, but economists say his tariffs by definition will lead to price increases.",
      "As price pressures from the tariffs have begun to build, businesses are signaling they will pass along higher prices to customers \u2014 in spite of Trump\u2019s warnings not to do so.",
      "Walmart said last month that consumers would soon start seeing higher costs. The National Federation of Independent Businesses reported Tuesday that a net 31% of its surveyed members planned price hikes last month, up from 28% in April.",
      "\u201cWalmart making their announcement that customers are going to start seeing higher prices really underscores how businesses are starting to feel this,\u201d said Stephen Kates, financial analyst with Bankrate. \u201cAnd if the largest businesses are saying this, smaller businesses are definitely feeling it, too \u2014 there\u2019s no way around that fact.\u201d",
      "Walmart responded to Trump\u2019s threats by saying it would \u201ckeep prices as low as we can for as long as we can given the reality of small retail margins.\u201d",
      "Price inflation is already hitting other parts of the economy. In May, U.S. factories registered the highest share of price-increase reports since November 2022, S&P Global, a data and business consultancy group, said last week.",
      "And firms quoted in the Institute of Supply Management\u2019s latest manufacturing report noted the president\u2019s tariffs have wreaked havoc on their ability to plan for the future as they deal with the prospect of higher costs.",
      "If there has been any price relief, it is likely the result of an overall slowing economy, analysts say, with a weakening labor market forcing consumers to cut back on spending. The pace of airfare, hotel and gas-price growth was likely lower in May as customers reduced their travel, with new Bank of America data showing spending rates remain below levels seen before Trump took office.",
      "Even if May\u2019s price-growth data comes in milder than expected, economists say past experience suggests the coming months will more fully capture the impact from the tariffs. In a note to clients this week, Pantheon Macroeconomics analysts said it took a full three months before the price increases from Trump\u2019s 2018 washing machine tariffs showed up in data \u2014 but that when they did, the pass-through was \u201crapid and complete.\u201d",
      "That suggests it would take until July for the tariffs \u2014 the bulk of which were announced in April \u2014 to begin to fully appear.",
      "Even if the pace of price growth is no longer at the pace seen in 2022, when inflation rates reached levels not seen in decades, Bankrate\u2019s Kates said consumers are still going to be left smarting.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s going to be a persistent itch that doesn\u2019t go away,\u201d Kates said."

    "summary": "A memo to immigration judges provides new insight into a tactic the Trump administration is using in a bid to increase the number of immigrants it's detaining.",
    "story": [
      "A recent memo to immigration judges obtained by NBC News provides fresh insight into how the Trump administration is pulling off a new tactic \u2014 dismissing pending immigration cases, then immediately moving to arrest the immigrants \u2014 that is part of its bid to quickly increase the number of immigrants it is detaining.",
      "In the memo, the Justice Department instructs immigration judges, who report to the executive branch and are not part of the independent judiciary, to allow Department of Homeland Security lawyers to make motions to dismiss orally and then move quickly to grant those dismissals, rather than allow immigrants the 10-day response time that had been typical.",
      "\u201cOral Decisions must be completed within the same hearing slot on the day testimony and arguments are concluded,\u201d says the memo, which is dated May 30. It also tells the judges that \u201c[n]o additional documentation or briefing is required\u201d to grant the dismissals.",
      "Once their cases are dismissed, the immigrants in question may be put in expedited removal proceedings, which means they can be deported without a chance to make their cases for asylum before immigration judges. The memo notes that people in expedited removal proceedings \u201care subject to mandatory detention\u201d and can be taken into custody by Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which falls under DHS.",
      "The Justice Department did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "A source close to the immigration judges\u2019 union said that the move is legal but that it is still upsetting to many immigration judges.",
      "\u201cThey think it makes a mockery of the whole process and that it flies in the face of what Trump ran on. Immigration enforcement means it\u2019s done in a fair manner ... and this isn\u2019t fair,\u201d the source close to the union said. Immigration judges are not authorized to speak to the media except through their union.",
      "The memo cites a provision of the Immigration and Nationality Act that sets out the conditions under which the government can move to dismiss an immigrant\u2019s case. But it misstates the statute. The memo says, without quotation marks, that judges may grant motions to dismiss when \u201ccircumstances have changed to such an extent that continuation is no longer in the best interest of the government.\u201d But the Immigration and Nationality Act\u2019s wording is more specific; it states that cases can be dismissed when \u201ccircumstances of the case have changed to such an extent that continuation is no longer in the best interest of the government.\u201d",
      "Greg Chen, senior director of government relations at the American Immigration Lawyers Association, said he believes the new guidance violates that provision of the Immigration Nationality Act and is not legal.",
      "\u201cThe omission of the words \u2018of the case\u2019 is deliberate because DHS is trying to avoid having to speak to the individual case. The law requires them to provide particular reasons for their motion, and they are not doing that. The email is the written policy that contradicts the law,\u201d Chen said.",
      "Jason Houser, who was chief of staff at ICE during the Biden administration, said dismissing cases that way will allow ICE to arrest more people but will not really help it speed up deportations because it lacks enough space to detain those arrested before deportation.",
      "The tactic of dismissing cases and then arresting people whose cases were dismissed \u201ctargets vetted migrants who were working and had legal status,\u201d he said. \u201cFlooding the system with thousands of noncriminals wastes time and resources when federal law enforcement should be focused on national security threats.\u201d",
      "As the agency steps up arrests, it faces an overcrowding issue. More than 51,000 immigrants were in ICE custody as of May 23, according to ICE data, though it is funded to hold only 41,500. Former ICE officials have said the agency can run over that allotment by only so much, and then only for a short amount of time, before it risks budget shortfalls and possible penalties from courts for living conditions that fall below court-mandated standards."

      "China considers Taiwan its own territory, to be brought under its control by force if necessary. Many Taiwanese in the self-ruled island showed concerns about Hong Kong\u2019s declining freedoms under Beijing\u2019s grip.",

      "The stakes are high for Musk and his companies, some of which rely on government subsidies. Tesla lost $152 billion in market capitalization in the wake of the spat, its biggest hit ever, but its stock price has since recouped some of those losses."

      "\"Thank you,\" Rodgers said.",
      "When another reporter chimed in asking how long ago the wedding took place, Rodgers said, \u201cIt's been a couple of months.\u201d The conversation then shifted back to the matter at hand: football.",
      "Rodgers was recently spotted wearing a ring on that finger while appearing on an episode of \u201cThe Joe Rogan Experience\u201d podcast. However, this is the first time the athlete has spoken publicly about his new marital status.",
      "TODAY.com has reached out to Rodgers' team for additional comment.",
      "While appearing on an episode of \"The Pat McAfee Show\" on April 17, Rodgers acknowledged that he was seeing someone special.",
      "\"I'm in a different phase of my life. You know, I'm 41 years old. I'm in a serious relationship. I have off-the-field stuff going on that requires my attention. I have personal commitments that I've made not knowing what my future was going to look like last year that are important to me,\" he said at the time.",
      "Earlier this year, Rodgers\u2019 fans learned that he would not be returning to the New York Jets as a quarterback. He has now assumed a role as quarterback for the Pittsburgh Steelers.",
      "The football player was previously engaged to actor Shailene Woodley but the couple went their separate ways in 2022."

      "This past week, performer, \u201cRuPaul\u2019s Drag Race\u201d finalist and makeup mogul was spreading natto on lavash.",
      "\u201cBack on my bulls---,\u201d she said before taking a bite.",
      "The pairing of the Japanese fermented soybean dish with the Armenian flatbread shows her palate is as adventurous as her drag persona.",
      "This international culinary philosophy is documented in her debut cookbook, \u201cKim Chi Eats the World,\u201d which comes out on Oct. 21 from publisher Union Square & Co.",
      "The book features 75 recipes inspired by Kim Chi\u2019s life thus far \u2014 from her childhood in both South Korea and the U.S. to the countries she\u2019s visited during her drag career.",
      "Kim Chi has said on social media that the book was developed during the pandemic when she couldn\u2019t travel and wanted to re-create the dishes she\u2019s had all over the world in her own kitchen.",
      "It is separated into four main parts \u2014 one for each continent covered \u2014 and consists of foods from 21 countries: ketchup chips from Canada, lemon sole from France, roasted flour soup from Switzerland and pineapple cake bars from Taiwan.",
      "\u201cIt all stems from my experiences,\u201d Kim Chi tells TODAY.com. \u201cI\u2019ve always been curious about food from around the world and how other people eat.\u201d",
      "Get The Recipe",
      "The worlds of drag and home-cooking have been intertwined for decades. Back in 1996, Honey Van Campe published \u201cThe Drag Queen\u2019s Cookbook & Guide to Sensible Living.\u201d",
      "Over the years, queens like Ruby Ann Boxcar, Ginger Minj and Silky Nutmeg Ganache have dropped their own cookbooks. Trixie Mattel, a frequent Kim Chi collaborator, was nominated for a James Beard award in 2018 for making a peanut butter jelly sandwich and a cocktail.",
      "\u201cWith my book, the idea is introducing global cuisine to the American audience,\u201d Kim Chi says, adding that she\u2019s developed recipes that are easy to replicate using pantry staples. \u201cSo even if someone has never had a specific dish, they can easily just go to a grocery store, get all the ingredients they need and try out the recipe. I wanted to make the global flavors fun and accessible.\u201d",
      "Kim Chi \u2014 named after the Korean fermented vegetable dish \u2014 has a litany of food-based entries on her resume: She has partnered with Chipotle and Trejo\u2019s Donuts; she appeared on Hulu\u2019s \u201cDrag Me to Dinner\u201d with fellow \u201cDrag Race\u201d Season 8 finalist Naomi Smalls; she hosts the \u201c1 For The Table\u201d podcast with YouTuber and cook Jon Kung; and she\u2019s posted what she\u2019s eaten on the road from Singapore to Oregon on her food-focused Instagram account.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s funny how drag and food overlap,\u201d she writes in the introduction of her cookbook. \u201cBoth are about creativity, storytelling, and, most of all, a little drama. When it comes to blending eyeshadow or blending spices, I want everything to be just right. But what really ties drag and food together is the way they both unite people.\u201d",
      "Her love of food developed early. Born in Lansing, Michigan, she moved to South Korea when she was five and then back to the Midwest when she was 12.",
      "She describes the \u201cculture shock\u201d of the cafeteria at school \u2014 leaving behind the fresh variety of a Korean midday meal to eat a typical American lunch. This led her to the kitchen, fostering a lifelong interest in foods that don\u2019t come with a mini-carton of milk.",
      "\u201cAfter growing up in Korea and then moving to the States, being able to recreate the Korean dishes that my grandmother or my mom used to make in Korea was a good way to connect to my culture, especially where I grew up in small-town Michigan,\u201d Kim Chi says. \u201cThere really wasn\u2019t that much diversity.\u201d",
      "She says that in those formative adolescent years, her mom worked a lot, so she was in charge of cooking for her and her brother.",
      "\u201cAt home, I\u2019d just be creative, because ... we were poor,\u201d she says. \u201cI always worked with whatever ingredients we had in the kitchen and I would get really creative, and sometimes the recipes wouldn\u2019t work out, but when it did, it would be a hit.\u201d",
      "A childhood staple in the book that was also born out of the need to be creative is budae jjigae, aka \u201cArmy Base Stew,\u201d a hearty noodle stew that originated after the Korean War, as South Korean soldiers used U.S. military rations. Ingredients like Spam, kielbasa, baked beans and American cheese are simmered in a classic soup base of gochujang and kimchi.",
      "Get The Recipe",
      "She says she hopes some of her recipes help picky eaters branch out.",
      "Another recipe, Taiwanese ice cream wraps, features \u00ada crepe base, taro ice cream, grated candied peanuts and cilantro \u2014 a combination of flavors one might not expect in a dessert.",
      "\u201cI want the audience at home to experience the same shock I had when I tasted it,\u201d she says. \u201cI feel like life is too short to eat the same boring food over and over again, you know?\u201d",
      "\u201cEven if you don\u2019t like it, maybe this will make you more open-minded towards different types of food. It\u2019s a great way to learn about how people live, the climate and the types of ingredients that they have access to,\u201d she continues. \u201cAnd maybe it\u2019ll also make you more open-minded towards the world overall.\u201d"

      "\"I always used to say, 'I'm never getting married,'\" Cooper said in her new Hulu docuseries, \"Call Her Alex.\"",
      "\"I thought it would threaten my independence \u2014 no man should be able to say that I'm his. My view changed with Matt.\"",
      "Here's what to know.",
      "Who Is Matt Kaplan?",
      "Matt Kaplan, 41, is a Hollywood producer who's made his mark in the entertainment industry with hit projects like Netflix's \"To All the Boys I've Loved Before\" franchise and the spinoff \"XO Kitty.\"",
      "After working for CBS and Lionsgate Films, Kaplan founded Chapter One Films in 2013, per Deadline, and later established Ace Entertainment in 2017, where he serves as founder and CEO.",
      "Kaplan was previously married to actor Claire Holt from 2016 to 2017.",
      "Today, Kaplan and Cooper have co-founded media company Trending together.",
      "The love story that started on Zoom",
      "Cooper and Kaplan's love story began in July 2020, when Cooper had a long day full of online meetings with film and television companies.",
      "Her last meeting of the day was with Ace Productions, Kaplan's company. Cooper later dubbed him \"Mr. Sexy Zoom Man\" on her podcast.",
      "\u201cYou know those people you meet immediately that it\u2019s just like you feel like you\u2019ve known each other for so long?\u201d Cooper explained on an episode of \u201cCall Her Daddy.\u201d \u201cWe immediately vibed, and it was just like we\u2019re going to get along so well.\u201d",
      "Though the television show they discussed in that meeting didn't pan out, the couple decided to take a chance on each other.

      "\u201cI think overall I\u2019m really enjoying his company,\u201d she shared with her listeners in August 2020. \u201cAre we making plans for the future? Yeah. Am I obsessed with him? I don\u2019t know!\u201d",
      "Looking back, Kaplan appreciates the quirky nickname that started it all.",
      "\u201cMr. Sexy Zoom Man. I think that name that she created was silly but honest of how we met,\u201d he says in Cooper\u2019s new docuseries. \u201cI think it allowed me to ease my way into the Call Her Daddy fandom, because I enjoy being a behind-the-scenes person.\u201d",
      "Their Riviera Maya wedding",
      "The couple got engaged at Cooper\u2019s West Hollywood home in May 2023 during what she thought was a W Magazine photoshoot but was actually an elaborate proposal setup.",
      "Almost a year later, in April 2024, the couple tied the knot in Riviera Maya, Mexico.",
      "Cooper made the bold choice to walk down the aisle by herself, she told Vogue.",
      "\u201cAt the beginning of wedding planning, I really rejected the concept of being walked down by a man to be handed to another man,\u201d she said. \u201cMy mom also walked herself down the aisle, so in a sense, I guess we are creating our own tradition for the women in our family.\u201d",
      "The couple's dogs, Henry and Bruce, served as ring bearers, while Cooper's brother Grant officiated the ceremony.",

      "Matt\u2019s vows focused on their smaller, intimate moments: \u201cIt\u2019s the conversations at 3 a.m. when we both can\u2019t sleep, shrouded in darkness of night, and thus able to speak more openly to one another. The whiskey in our yard on Friday nights after a long week. You mean the world to me. Thank you for coming into my life. I love you.\u201d",

      "She told W Magazine after their engagement why Kaplan was able to change her mind about marriage.",
      "\u201cWe had a really great dynamic early on that I didn\u2019t have in previous relationships, which is the amount that we communicate \u2014 even over communicate \u2014 about difficult things. Having that foundation of honesty and trust allowed us to get through things in life that made it so I couldn\u2019t envision anyone else by my side. On top of that, we have this insane chemistry.\u201d",

    "summary": "Mark Hamill talks about his role in \"The Life of Chuck\" and why the Stephen King movie might make you cry \"tears of joy.\"",
    "story": [
      "Mark Hamill's new film is probably going to make you cry, but that doesn't mean you shouldn't see it.",
      "\"It's tears of joy because it reaffirms your belief in mankind,\" Hamill explains in a sit-down interview with TODAY.com.",
      "The movie? \"The Life of Chuck.\" It's the latest project for the \"Star Wars\" actor, who plays Albie Krantz, the wise grandfather of Charles \"Chuck\" Krantz. Chuck is a man whose life is chronicled in reverse by four different actors: Cody Flanagan, Benjamin Pajak, Jacob Tremblay and Tom Hiddleston, who portrays Chuck as an adult.",
      "Based on Stephen King's 2020 novella of the same name, it's a serious departure from the writer's typical horror genre, although  Hamill says it's still got a few of King's signature trademarks, including supernatural and apocalyptic elements.",
      "\"It's certainly nothing like Stephen King has ever written before,\" says Hamill. \"He's done 'Green Mile' and 'The Body,' which became 'Stand By Me,' but even by those standards, this is unlike anything he's done.\"",
      "Also starring Chiwetel Ejiofor, Mia Sara and Karen Gillan, Hamill says \"The Life of Chuck\" is \"indescribable\" but so profound \u2013 and good \u2013 that he asked if he could \"go out on the talk shows\" to encourage viewers to \"please see it. Trust me, you'll thank me later.\"",
      "If audiences at the Toronto International Film Festival are any indication, he doesn't have to worry. After premiering at the festival, the film took home the People's Choice Award and has since garnered rave reviews by many critics, some of whom called the film one of the year's best.",
      "\"It's so positive. It's so optimistic about life,\" Hamill tells TODAY.com. \"It also teaches you there are moments that, in life, you think are trivial that collectively become very important.\"",
      "And if \"The Life of Chuck\" leaves people in tears, Hamill says it's because a movie \"this original\" only \"comes along once in a lifetime.\"",
      "\"I just loved it,\" he says. \"It's wonderful.\"",
      "'The Long Walk'",
      "\"The Life of Chuck\" isn't Hamill's only collaboration with King. The actor also appears in the upcoming film \"The Long Walk,\" a horror movie based on King's 1979 novel of the same name (published under the pseudonym Richard Bachman), starring Ben Wang, Cooper Hoffman, David Jonsson and Judy Greer, among others.",
      "\"The premise is just ghastly,\" he says of the film. \"It is more in the mold of what you associate Stephen King with.\"",
      "Less of a supernatural movie and more straight-up horror, \"The Long Walk\" takes place in a dystopian future and revolves around a group of young men who are chosen, a la \"The Hunger Games,\" to participate in a walk that only ends when everyone dies, except for a single, indomitable winner.",
      "\"The rules are simple: You walk until only one is alive,\" explains Hamill, saying that if walkers lag behind, fall to their knees or deviate from the walk in any way, it's \"a bullet to the head.\"",
      "Based on its grim premise, Hamill says his initial reaction to the role was, \"Not only can I not be in this, I don't think I can see it.\"",
      "But given that Francis Lawrence, the iconic director of \"The Hunger Games: Catching Fire\" and \"The Hunger Games: Mockingjay\" Parts 1 and 2, along with other notable films including the sci-fi classic \"I Am Legend,\" was at the helm of \"The Long Walk,\" Hamill says he reconsidered.",
      "\"I really admire him as a director,\" he explains, saying that after a call with Lawrence he changed his mind. \"By the end of the Zoom call, I said, 'Well, I've got to do it.' And my boys, of course, read it and said, 'Dad, this is great. You've got to do it.'\"",
      "Hamill plays a military major, or as he puts it, \"a badass guy,\" but says the true stars of the movie are the young actors he worked with, calling them the \"heart and soul\" of the movie.",
      "\"I was so impressed. These are all the young actors you're going to see in the future.\"",
      "'I Owe the World to Mike Flanagan'",
      "As for his own future, Hamill says he's loving \"every minute\" of his career right now and hopes to work on more projects with Mike Flanagan, the director and screenwriter of \"The Life of Chuck.\" Flanagan also created such notable series as \"The Haunting of Hill House,\" \"Midnight Mass\" and \"The Fall of the House of Usher,\" in which Hamill played Arthur Pym, a shadowy figure known as the \"Pym Reaper.\"",
      "\"It's the first time I've ever been asked to play something so far from myself on camera,\" he says of the role. \"Because I was playing a sociopathic, soulless, evil lawyer.\"",
      "Having done voice work for decades, Hamill says it's a role that would have been routine if he had done it as a voice-over, but he is grateful to Flanagan for giving him the opportunity to do such a \"juicy\" role in front of the camera.",
      "\"I owe the world to Mike Flanagan. That's why I'm so loyal to him. That's why I jumped at 'The Life of Chuck,'\" he says, continuing, \"He's just wonderful.\"",
      "As for what's next, Hamill says he's got yet another, undisclosed project in the works with Flanagan, but for the moment remains firmly focused on ensuring that audiences come out to see \"The Life of Chuck.\"",
      "\"You realize that human beings are inherently good,\" he says of the film's takeaway. \"And in this atmosphere of division and anger and uncertainty, it's exactly the right movie at exactly the right time.\""

      "The nanny started to scream and was pinned against a wall, with the shorter one holding her mouth shut, the police report said. She tried to kick the shorter one in the groin but was unable to see so she bit onto his hand hard, causing him to let go. The nanny then ran out of the home and knocked on numerous neighbors\u2019 doors before someone opened the door and let her call police, the report said.",

    "summary": "V. E. Schwab's newest novel, \"Bury Our Bones In the Midnight Soil,\" is a fantasy story about three queer vampires,",
    "story": [
      "For years, V. E. Schwab hasn\u2019t felt \"gay enough.\"",
      "\"With quotation marks \u2014 obviously it's an absurd concept,\" she tells TODAY.com. \"There is no such thing, and I know that.\"",
      "Schwab's journey coming out as queer started about 10 years ago, she says. But the hit fantasy author \u2014\u00a0known for 2013's \"Vicious,\" 2015's \"A Darker Shade of Magic,\" the 2020 BookTok darling \"The Invisible Life of Addie LaRue\" and more \u2014 has long strived to \"assimilate\" into the genre.",
      "When she started publishing, she downplayed the fact that she's a woman. And though her stories always featured LGBTQ+ characters, (in a 2018 tweet, Schwab notably said all characters in her \"Shades of Magic\" series \"should be presumed queer unless stated otherwise\"),\u00a0she didn't lead with her own \"queerness,\" she says.",
      "\"I didn't want to do anything that would limit the growth of readership,\" Schwab says.",
      "The result was that \"no one ever thinks I'm gay,\" she reflects now. She thought she didn't mind. If blending behind the pseudonym of her initials meant someone may read her books, not knowing the breadth of identities ahead, and learn something? Better than someone not picking up the book at all, she says.",
      "In 2020, Schwab told her coming out story publicly in an essay for Oprah Daily. But it wasn't until her latest novel, \"Bury Our Bones in the Midnight Soil,\" out June 10, that she felt comfortable living, being, existing in that story.",
      "\"What I didn't predict and what turned out to be true is the catharsis of writing this book as a gay person,\" Schwab says. \"I did not realize how badly I needed to write this in order to take up the space of this story.\"",
      "\u2018I Can't Think of Any Greater Gift\u2019",
      "\"Bury Our Bones in the Midnight Soil\" follows three women across a 500-year period, with alternating perspectives. The book opens with 10-year-old Maria in 1500s Spain. We next meet Alice, a college first-year in 2019 trying to face her anxiety at a party. Within pages, both Maria (who later renames herself Sabine) and Alice describe themselves \u2014 or who they want to be \u2014 as \"feral.\"",
      "Then there's Charlotte, or Lottie, born in 1800s England, who knots their stories all together.",
      "All three start as young women chafing against their circumstances, until another woman arrives. (Sabine encounters a widow passing through her home of Santo Domingo, Charlotte encounters Sabine, and Alice encounters Charlotte.) Their stories are different, but end the same: Each woman leaves dead \u2014 specifically, as a vampire.",
      "Schwab was inspired by the \"classic\" vampiric lore \u2014 \"everything from 'Carmilla' essentially up through Anne Rice,\" she says.",
      "\"If you go back and you look at these classic vampires, they're inherently queer, they're inherently liminal, they represent knowledge and the danger of being exposed to an alternate potential future,\" she says. \"And the idea is that once you're exposed, you can never go back to ignorance.\"",
      "A longtime love of vampires was just one of the \"ingredients\" that went into \"Bury Our Bones.\" (\"I see my stories as a meal,\" Schwab explains.) Other themes include queer love throughout history and collateral damage, first explored through what Schwab had long been taught about one-night stands.",
      "\"I'm an only child, and for some reason, my parents thought the way to keep me safe growing up \u2014 I remember this coming in at like, 13, it was a lesson for my future \u2014\u00a0was to never have a one-night stand,\" Schwab says, explaining she was taught that by definition, the act involves being in close quarters with a complete stranger and \"putting yourself in inherent danger.\"",
      "\"I always thought this was a hysterical take,\" she adds.",
      "For Alice's storyline, Schwab followed this lesson to its most extreme conclusion. In the spirit of taking on the mantle of a \"New Alice\" at university, Alice invites a woman (Charlotte) home to have sex ... and wakes up dead, paying the price of Charlotte's desire.",
      "She's robbed of a choice, but she's granted the metaphorical and literal teeth that ensure ultimate survival.",
      "\"I think we spend so much time with male vampires as the lead, and I'm like, 'They don't need it,'\" she says. \"You know who actually needs teeth, is the person who is made to feel small, told to limit their desire, told never to be insatiable, told never to want, told exactly how little they are supposed to take up in the world.\"",
      "To Schwab, the most important moment in the book occurs when Alice in the present day realizes the she has nothing to be afraid of. No, everyone else fears her.",
      "\"The thing about an immortal is that they endure. That is, by definition, what they do. They endure when you shouldn't be able to, and I can't think of any greater gift to give my lesbian women than the sense that they would get to know they would endure,\" she says.",
      "Writing Herself Into the Story",
      "Speaking with TODAY.com less than two weeks before publication date, Schwab says she's feeling \"deep, deep, crashing out in real time-level neuroses.\" Normally she'd be on deadline for her next project, but she purposefully finished a first draft of her next work (\"Victorious,\" the third and final book in the \"Villains\" series) early to be present for the release of \"Bury Our Bones in the Midnight Soil.\"",
      "\"In many ways, this story is about the three eras of my own queer coming out journey, and going from not knowing who you are, to just wanting to be loved, to being unapologetic,\" Schwab says. \"There's just a lot more nonfiction underpinning the fiction than I'm used to.\"",
      "Sabine represents the version of Schwab that was able to write a book like this, she says. Sabine is unapologetic about her beliefs, actions and behaviors, even as the novel's \"villain.\" She's fully realized and uninterested in \"conforming to anyone else's idea of what a life is,\" Schwab says.",
      "\"I think I had to get to her in my own journey before I could look back at my Alice and Lottie years,\" she says.",
      "Alice, the youngest of the pack, starts the novel open about her sexuality but struggling to define herself out of the shadow of her sister. She stands in for a version of Schwab who was trying to find her identity while dealing with the \"whiplash\" of a major event shaking one's foundation. For Schwab, it was realizing she was gay. For Alice, it was waking up a vampire.",
      "Then there's the \"Lottie years,\" or as Schwab calls them, \"the toxic years.\" Charlotte is defined by \"desperately wanting to be loved,\" even at the expense of others.",
      "When asked for one true \"villain\" of her vampire novel, Schwab gives the potentially hot take of Lottie. (\"We do not stan someone who perceives themselves as a victim when they are an abuser,\" Schwab says.) But all three women make terrible decisions and do awful things. That's, too, a reflection of Schwab's experience coming out and her relationship with publishing.",
      "\"For many, many years, even after I had come out, there was a sense that you could not write a queer villain, lest the readership conflate queerness and villainy,\" she says. \"It's such a harmfully reductive take because it suggests that queer characters, and by extension, queer humans, are not afforded the same level of complexity and nuance as their straight counterparts.\"",
      "By embracing a trio of \"messy b----es\" to lead the novel, every page, sentence and word, Schwab says, hones in on one purpose: hunger.",
      "\"I wanted to write a book about hunger in all of the forms that it takes, specifically for women and femme-presenting people and queer people \u2014 the hunger to be loved, to be seen, to be understood, and the hunger to take up space in a world that tries to make you small,\" she says. \"I think that's what I achieved.\"",
      "Returning to 'the Garden' \u2014 and the Easter Egg You Might Have Missed",
      "Before \"Bury Our Bones,\" Schwab didn't think she'd ever put herself \"so clearly\" into a project again. \"The Invisible Life of Addie LaRue\" featured a character named Henry, whom Schwab describes as a character she \"wrote myself into.\"",
      "In the 2020 novel, the titular character trades being forgotten by everyone she meets for immortality. Henry is the first person who remembers her after her deal with the devil.",
      "If Addie and her sense of hope are an inspiration, the story of Sabine, Charlotte and Alice is more about the messes immortal beings leave behind.",
      "\u201cI wanted something a little bit angrier,\u201d Schwab says. \u201cI think that\u2019s just an indicator of my own growth as a person. I think that\u2019s an indicator of the landscape of the world. I just spend a lot of my time feeling stifled or angry or what have you.\u201d",
      "It's fitting then that \"Bury Our Bones\" is set in the same universe as \"Addie LaRue.\" Both are Schwab's take on \"urban fantasy, but in a literary way,\" she says, a world facsimiled of our own that she refers to as \"the Garden.\"",
      "\"I wouldn't be surprised if I revisit this space, because it's a place that I really enjoy creatively and aesthetically,\" Schwab says. \"I can see the Garden growing together and apart and in multiple directions.\"",
      "There's even a cameo from a character in \"Addie LaRue\" in a blink-and-you-miss-it moment more than halfway through the book, told in Charlotte's perspective. The goal is to establish that in this Garden, \"there are multiple kinds of magic and wonder and monstrosity just intertwined with our time and place and our history.\"",
      "Schwab says only eagle-eyed readers may spot the reference. And though she calls it the \"loosest thread\" she'd likely ever tie between her Garden books, it has consequences for the wider story.",
      "\"It has a repercussion if readers stop and think about it, which is that these characters are occupying the same terrain,\" Schwab says. \"They are coexisting in the same landscape. Addie's history has at some point tangled with one of our vampires.'\""

      "On June 9, Judge Lewis J. Liman of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York granted a motion to dismiss the lawsuit filed by the Wayfarer Parties, which includes Baldoni, accusing Lively, Reynolds and their publicist, Leslie Sloane, of defamation and extortion after Lively filed a sexual harassment complaint against Baldoni, according to court documents obtained by TODAY.com.",
      "Baldoni's team also sued The New York Times for libel over an article published about Lively's sexual harassment complaint against Baldoni in December 2024.",

      "\u201cThe Wayfarer Parties have alleged that Reynolds and Sloane made additional statements accusing Baldoni of sexual misconduct and that the Times made additional statements accusing the Wayfarer Parties of engaging in a smear campaign,\u201d the judge wrote. \u201cBut the Wayfarer Parties have not alleged that Reynolds, Sloane or the Times would have seriously doubted these statements were true based on the information available to them, as is required for them to be liable for defamation under applicable law.\u201d",

We look forward to the next round, which is seeking attorneys\u2019 fees, treble damages and punitive damages against Baldoni, Sarowitz, Nathan, and the other Wayfarer Parties who perpetrated this abusive litigation,\u201d they added.",
      "TODAY.com has reached out to attorneys for Baldoni for comment.",
      "Lively and Baldoni's legal woes began in December 2024 when Lively filed her sexual harassment complaint against Baldoni for his alleged behavior on the set of \"It Ends with Us,\" which was primarily shot in New Jersey.",
      "Since then, the high-profile case has been filled with legal twists and turns that would be at home in a Hollywood courtroom drama.",
      "After Baldoni sued The New York Times in December 2024 for the newspaper's story about Lively's complaint, Lively initiated litigation against Baldoni the same month in a federal court in New York.",
      "In January 2024, Baldoni sued Lively for defamation. The following month, the actor and director launched a website about his lawsuit with Lively that included text messages between the two stars as well as between Baldoni and Reynolds.",
      "In February, Lively amended her sexual harassment complaint to suggest she wasn't the only one on the \"It Ends with Us\" set to accuse Baldoni of misconduct.",

      "Jenna was delighted by the story: \"See? Even bad proposals end up OK! We all have them.\"",

      "In a post on X, an account run by the Israeli Foreign Affairs Ministry said that more than 1,200 aid trucks had entered Gaza from Israel \u201cwithin the past two weeks,\u201d with just more than 10 million meals distributed from aid sites run by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, the group tasked with distributing food under a controversial new system.",
      "The GHF's centers have been intermittently closed over the week after dozens of Palestinians were shot and killed near its operations.",
      "Gaza has a population of around 2.1 million people, so the meals the foreign affairs ministry referenced would, over the course of two weeks, equate to roughly a third of a meal per day for each member of the population.",

    "story": [
      "A Burmese American woman was eager to bring her siblings over to the U.S. from Myanmar amid a more than 15-year wait for visas. She\u2019d been hoping to reunite with them since the 1990s, during military rule in her home country, so her brother\u2019s family could start a life in the U.S. But a day after she bought the plane tickets, President Donald Trump ordered a travel ban that included Myanmar.",
      "The woman, 51, and her husband, who were granted anonymity due to fear of retaliation, had sponsored her brother and sister-in-law to immigrate to the U.S. The siblings were then were hoping to bring their own adult kids, too, so that they wouldn\u2019t have to fulfill mandatory military service in the country\u2019s active civil war.",
      "With the travel ban in effect Monday, they said the policy has a heightened impact on people from war-torn countries like Myanmar who had hopes of finding sanctuary in the U.S.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s really frustrating because we were on the cusp of securing their safety to leave that situation,\u201d said her husband, 57, adding he felt like a \u201crug got pulled out from under us in an instant.\u201d",
      "White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson said Trump\u2019s policy is in the \u201cbest interest of the American people and their safety.\u201d",
      "\u201cHis commonsense, country-specific travel restrictions include places that lack proper vetting, exhibit high visa overstay rates, or fail to share identity and threat information,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cThe restrictions fulfill the President\u2019s day one promise to protect American citizens from dangerous foreign actors who may come to the United States and cause us harm.\u201d",
      "The travel restrictions, announced on Wednesday, completely bar entry to the U.S. for people from Myanmar, formerly known as Burma, in addition to those from Afghanistan, the Republic of Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen. Other countries, including Cuba, Laos and Venezuela, are under partial travel restrictions.",
      "According to Trump\u2019s proclamation, several of the countries on the list had declined to accept the repatriation of their nationals while others had visa overstay rates that the administration deemed \u201cunacceptable.\u201d A few countries lacked \u201cthe competence of the central authority\u201d for issuing passports, the proclamation said.",
      "Jackson also pointed out a section in the proclamation that allows for applications for refugee status.",
      "\u201cNothing in this proclamation shall be construed to limit the ability of an individual to seek asylum, refugee status, withholding of removal, or protection under the [international Convention Against Torture], consistent with the laws of the United States,\u201d the proclamation said.",
      "However, after he took office, Trump limited refugee admissions for almost all countries including Myanmar. And in May, the Supreme Court allowed the Trump administration to revoke the temporary legal status of more than 500,000 immigrants that was granted by the Biden administration. Those immigrants came from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela and are now subject to deportation.",
      "Myanmar was among the nine countries in the latest proclamation that Trump also targeted during his first term. In fiscal year 2023, the U.S. issued 13,284 visas to the country, with business and tourism permits making up the most common types of visas. Myanmar recorded 1,384 overstays that fiscal year, equating to an overstay rate of almost 30%.",
      "The new travel ban comes as Myanmar\u2019s violent military regime fights to hold on to power after it seized control from the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi in a 2021 coup. Since then, violence has escalated across the region as the military clashes with ethnic minority rebel groups and pro-democracy militias.",
      "\u201cJunta forces have slaughtered thousands of civilians, bombed and burned villages, and displaced millions of people,\u201d Tom Andrews, United Nations special rapporteur on the human rights situation in Myanmar, said in a press release earlier this year. \u201cMore than 20,000 political prisoners remain behind bars. The economy and public services have collapsed. Famine and starvation loom over large parts of the population.\u201d",
      "Under the new travel ban, anyone who obtained a visa prior to the policy is still able to come to the U.S. But there\u2019s confusion over how the restrictions will be implemented and enforced. The Burmese American woman and her husband are among those with concerns, particularly as there have been several cases of lawful permanent residents and citizens being swept up in the dragnet of Trump\u2019s immigration policies.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s terrifying to think that they could be randomly picked up because somebody had a bad day at the office, or somebody didn\u2019t do their job or didn\u2019t believe that their visa was true,\u201d the woman's husband said. \u201cIt\u2019s quite frankly terrifying.\u201d",
      "For the woman, reunification with her brother has been a long time coming. She became a citizen in the late 1990s and began the process to help bring her sibling over a few years later. At the time, Myanmar had been under the control of a strict military junta that held power from the 1960s until 2011, and for decades had kept the country in a state of extreme isolation and deprivation. She said her brother, whose children were just a few years old then, hoped to come over and root his family in more stability.",
      "\u201cTheir circumstances in Myanmar at that time were very, very bad. That was the system that I grew up in. There was no future for them, no prosperity,\u201d the woman said. \u201cMy brother was concerned for his children\u2019s future and education.\u201d",
      "Amid moves and address changes, the couple said they never received the standard letter notifying them that the woman's brother had been able to progress in his visa process. They assumed the wait was a product of notorious immigration backlogs. It wasn\u2019t until the situation in Myanmar intensified again in recent years that the couple found out that the brother was close to finally being able to immigrate. But by then, the woman said, her brother\u2019s kids had aged out of the system.",
      "According to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, those who turn 21 before being approved for legal permanent resident status are no longer considered a child for immigration purposes and need to file an entirely new application, prolonging the green card process.",
      "At this point, the woman said, her brother and sister-in-law said they were willing to risk possible detention to come to the U.S., particularly if it meant easier access to the American immigration system that would enable them to fight to get their children to come over as well. However, with Myanmar\u2019s military draft in effect, the family is particularly concerned for their safety now that the travel ban adds another barrier to leaving.",
      "\u201cThe reason they wanted to come here was for their kids,\u201d the woman said of her brother and sister-in-law. \u201cNow, it\u2019s really hard to bring my nephews here to save their lives.\u201d",
      "Quyen Dinh, executive director of the Southeast Asia Resource Action Center, said the bans are ultimately another part of \u201cthe engine of Trump\u2019s mass deportation machine.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s focused on demonizing immigrant families and communities by denying them family reunification, that we all rightfully deserve to be whole \u2014 especially now, when the world is more dangerous than ever,\u201d Dinh said.",
      "Rather than protecting individuals\u2019 safety, Dinh said, she believes Trump\u2019s policy punishes those who need an escape from dangerous conditions.",
      "\u201cIt perpetuates the violence that is happening across the world, as opposed to creating conditions for peace or humanitarian relief, and for these families who\u2019ve been separated,\u201d Dinh said.",
      "She also said she views the ban as evidence that the U.S. is misunderstanding its role as a humanitarian leader.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve got people who are legitimately trying to escape a civil war,\u201d the woman's husband said. \u201cNow, because of some arbitrary decision by the Trump administration to pick a certain number of countries \u2026 without consideration of the actual cases, without an exception policy, it hurts them. They\u2019ve done nothing wrong.\u201d"

    "summary": "An aid organization that has sent more than 100 Haitian children with serious cardiac conditions to the U.S. for heart surgery said President Donald Trump\u2019s travel ban will stall or cancel lifesaving procedures.",
    "story": [
      "Leaders of an aid organization that has sent more than 100 Haitian children with serious cardiac conditions to the U.S. for heart surgery said President Donald Trump\u2019s ban on travelers from 19 countries will stall or cancel lifesaving procedures for at least a dozen children or young adults.",
      "The ban, which goes into effect Monday, has led to widespread uncertainty for many and drawn condemnation from international leaders. The proclamation issued Tuesday offered exceptions for those who are lawful permanent U.S. residents and those traveling to the U.S. for the World Cup and the Olympics, among other examples. No such mention was made for cases of medical necessity, such as those who are seeking treatment in the U.S. through the International Cardiac Alliance.",
      "The International Cardiac Alliance\u2019s total waitlist for Haitians, ranging from infants to young adults, totals at least 316 people who need heart surgery, said Executive Director Owen Robinson. Some are placed in hospitals in the Dominican Republic and occasionally the Cayman Islands. But there are currently five open surgical slots in the U.S.",
      "\u201cSome of them might be able to wait a few months, and others, if they don\u2019t go now, they\u2019re going to pass away very quickly,\u201d Robinson said.",
      "The president\u2019s executive order adds that the secretary of state can issue exemptions for visas in cases that \u201cserve a United States national interest.\u201d It is unclear if clients of the International Cardiac Alliance with medical needs would fit into that description. Neither the White House nor the State Department responded to a request for comment on the matter.",
      "\u201cWe do have kids die every week waiting because there\u2019s not a lot of international slots for these kids,\u201d Robinson said.",
      "Some of the children in the program travel directly from their home country to the U.S., undergo surgery, and then return to Haiti. But for many Haitians, international travel requires multiple levels of logistical wrangling, Robinson said. Some patients and their parents who can secure surgeries in other countries must apply for a visa to the U.S., travel here, and then head to their eventual destination. The United States\u2019 travel ban now throws a wrench in that process.",
      "Fabienne Rene, 16, was diagnosed with rheumatic heart disease in February. Because of her condition, Fabienne, who lives in Port-au-Prince, cannot even attend school since she experiences shortness of breath, said her father, Fignole Rene. The \u201cbad news\u201d he received about the travel ban causing the postponement or potential cancellation of his daughter\u2019s travel through the U.S. to the Dominican Republic is \u201creally disturbing and breaking my heart,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cI was not waiting to hear something like that,\u201d Rene, 53, said in Creole through a translator. \u201cWe know for sure that there is nowhere in Haiti we can have this possibility. The only option that we have was just waiting to have an open door from the Cardiac Alliance.\u201d",
      "He also said the news will be troubling for his family to hear and that they don\u2019t know \u201cwhere they will find another open door that can give her a chance.\u201d",
      "Robinson said the U.S. Embassy in Haiti recently informed him that it most likely wouldn\u2019t be able to issue any visas due to the travel ban. In the past, the embassy has repeatedly issued visas for Haitian children to travel to the U.S. for care. The office of Rep. Becca Balint, D-Vt., has offered to reach out to the State Department to see if the children can receive exceptions, he added.",
      "Dr. John Clark, a pediatric cardiologist at Akron Children\u2019s Hospital in Ohio who has worked with the ICA, said many children in impoverished countries like Haiti suffer from Fabienne\u2019s condition because they are not seen by a doctor and treated for the common illness strep throat. Untreated, recurring strep infections can lead to rheumatic heart disease.",
      "St. Damien Pediatric Hospital in Port-au-Prince received visiting pediatric surgical teams from 2015 to 2019, Robinson said. Now, dangerous conditions in Haiti prevent doctors from other countries from entering or providing care. Meanwhile, Haiti does not have enough doctors practicing there, and the loss of opportunities for a medical education in Haiti only perpetuates the problem, Clark said.",
      "Clark participated in a surgical mission there in 2019, when visiting U.S. doctors were performing two heart surgeries per day, he said. A drastic rise in gang violence \u2014 including an attack on one of the hospital\u2019s ambulances and a worker being stoned to death \u2014 ended most medical missions to Haiti.",
      "Gang violence has only escalated since then, United Nations figures show, particularly after the assassination of Haiti\u2019s President Jovenel Mo\u00efse in 2021. Haiti is one of the poorest countries in the world, and more than half of Haitians live below the poverty line. The country is also plagued with government corruption, gang violence and food insecurity, as well as vulnerability to natural disasters, including a devastating 2010 earthquake that killed at least 220,000 people. Lack of adequate health care also fuels diseases like cholera, according to the Council on Foreign Relations.",
      "\u201cI hope things can calm down one day enough that we can get back there [to Haiti],\u201d Clark said. \u201cBut right now, there\u2019s no way for us to go back down.\u201d",
      "Andrice Boncoeur of Port-au-Prince received free open-heart surgery at CEDIMAT Cardiovascular Center in the Dominican Republic to repair a valve when he was 9 years old. That procedure, however, was only meant to be a temporary solution. Now, plans for Andrice, 16, to travel through the U.S. for more permanent surgery have been disrupted.",
      "On Thursday, Andrice\u2019s father, Andre Boncoeur, said he had not yet told his son about the travel ban preventing him from passing through the U.S. Boncoeur said he knows \u201csomething can change at any time.\u201d",
      "Still, children like Andrice do not have much time to wait. In April, Andrice was once again hospitalized for three days at Haiti\u2019s Centre Hospitalier Eben-Ezer for heart failure. Boncoeur said his family has spent \u201ceverything that we had\u201d and that their funds are \u201calmost gone.\u201d He said he hopes the situation will change so that his son, who aspires to become a pastor, \u201ccan have a chance to live his life as a normal kid.\u201d",
      "Clark, Robinson and the patient\u2019s parents all agree it comes down to the Trump administration\u2019s willingness to accommodate the sick children.",
      "\u201cThese children are somebody\u2019s child and somebody\u2019s grandchild  and they don\u2019t have access to lifesaving care,\u201d Clark said. \u201cIs there any room for compassion?\u201d"

    "summary": "Argentina's highest court upheld a six-year prison sentence for former President Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner in a ruling Tuesday that permanently banned her from public office over a corruption conviction.",
    "story": [
      "BUENOS AIRES, Argentina \u2014 Argentina\u2019s highest court upheld a six-year prison sentence for former President Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner in a ruling Tuesday that permanently banned her from public office over the corruption conviction that found she had directed state contracts to a friend while she was the first lady and president.",
      "The explosive Supreme Court ruling left Fern\u00e1ndez, Argentina\u2019s charismatic yet deeply divisive ex-leader, subject to arrest and sent her supporters pouring into the streets of Buenos Aires, Argentina\u2019s capital, and blocking major highways in protest.",
      "The court asked Argentina\u2019s security ministry to set up a detention center to hold 72-year-old Fern\u00e1ndez. Her defense lawyer Carlos Beraldi told C5N, a television station in Buenos Aires, that he had requested Fern\u00e1ndez be allowed to serve her sentence in house arrest given her age.",
      "The ruling bars Fern\u00e1ndez from running in this fall\u2019s Buenos Aires legislative elections just days after she launched her campaign.",
      "Fern\u00e1ndez \u2014 who dominated Argentine politics for two decades and forged the country\u2019s main left-wing populist movement known as Kirchnerism, after her and her husband, former President N\u00e9stor Kirchner \u2014 rejects the charges as politically motivated.",
      "During Fern\u00e1ndez\u2019s eight years in office (2007\u20132015), Argentina expanded cash payments to the poor and pioneered major social assistance programs. But her governments funded the unbridled state spending by printing money, bringing Argentina notoriety for massive budget deficits and sky-high inflation.",
      "Critics blamed Argentina\u2019s years of economic volatility on Fern\u00e1ndez\u2019s policies, and outrage over successive economic crises and the country\u2019s bloated bureaucracy helped vault radical libertarian President Javier Milei to the presidency in late 2023.",
      "The ruling dealt a severe blow to Milei\u2019s opposition during a crucial midterm election year. He celebrated the ruling, writing on social media: \u201cJustice. Period.\u201d",
      "Fern\u00e1ndez was embroiled in multiple corruption scandals during her tenure. She was convicted in 2022 in this corruption case, which centered on 51 public contracts for public works awarded to companies linked to L\u00e1zaro B\u00e1ez, a convicted construction magnate and friend of the presidential couple, at prices 20% above the standard rate in a scheme that cost the state tens of millions of dollars.",
      "The high court rejected Fern\u00e1ndez\u2019s request for the court to review her prison sentence in March. In a resolution obtained by The Associated Press, the court said that the prison sentence \u201cdoes nothing more than to protect our republican and democratic system.\u201d",
      "The Kirchner governments carried out \u201can extraordinary fraudulent maneuver\u201d that harmed the interests of the government and resulted in the embezzlement of roughly $70 million at the current exchange rate, the resolution said.",
      "Supporters of Fern\u00e1ndez and her political movement blocked main roads into Buenos Aires and stormed the offices of Argentina\u2019s two main cable networks that are widely considered critical of the ex-leader, Channel 13 and Todos Noticias, smashing televisions, vandalizing cars and shattering windows. There were no injuries reported.",
      "Fern\u00e1ndez rejected the decision, calling the court justices \u201cpuppets\u201d of those wielding economic power in the country.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re three puppets answering to those ruling far above them,\u201d she told supporters in a rousing speech outside her party\u2019s headquarters. \u201cIt\u2019s not the opposition. It\u2019s the concentrated economic power of Argentina\u2019s government.\u201d",
      "Gregorio Dalb\u00f3n, one of Fern\u00e1ndez\u2019s lawyers, vowed \u201cto take this case to all international human rights organizations.\u201d",
      "Fern\u00e1ndez has questioned the impartiality of the judges. She claims her defense didn\u2019t have access to much of the evidence and that it was gathered without regard to legal deadlines.",
      "Fern\u00e1ndez faces a series of other upcoming trials on corruption charges."

      "\u201c\u2018Reversed Front: Bonfire\u2019 was released under the guise of a game with the aim of promoting secessionist agendas such as \u2018Taiwan independence\u2019 and \u2018Hong Kong independence,\u2019 advocating armed revolution and the overthrow of the fundamental system of the People\u2019s Republic of China,\u201d police said.",
      "The game application was developed by ESC Taiwan, which did not immediately respond to The Associated Press\u2019 request for comment. On the application\u2019s Facebook page, the developer posted about surging searches for the game name and a Hong Kong broadcaster\u2019s news report about Tuesday\u2019s development.",
      "According to the application\u2019s introduction, players can assume the role of Hong Kong, Tibet, Uyghur, Taiwan or Cathaysian Rebel factions, among others, to overthrow the communist regime. They may also choose to lead the communists to defeat all enemies.",
      "The game\u2019s website says it \u201cis a work of nonfiction. Any similarity to actual agencies, policies or ethnic groups of the PRC in this game is intentional.\u201d",
      "The app was still available on Apple\u2019s App Store on Tuesday night, but could no longer be found on Wednesday morning. The game publisher said last month that Google Play had taken the app down because it did not prohibit users from adopting hateful language in naming.",
      "Apple, Google and Meta have not immediately commented.",
      "After playing the game for about three months, Kuo Hao Fu in Taiwan said he found that its content uses a humorous approach to describe serious political issues. Fu disagreed with the police accusations, saying players can also choose to be part of the force representing China.",
      "\u201cThe Hong Kong police\u2019s actions demonstrate how Hong Kong\u2019s democratic freedoms have been controlled by the Chinese Communist Party,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen even this level cannot be tolerated, it completely destroys creative freedom in gaming.\u201d",
      "China considers Taiwan its own territory, to be brought under its control by force if necessary. Many Taiwanese in the self-ruled island showed concerns about Hong Kong\u2019s declining freedoms under Beijing\u2019s grip.",
      "The Beijing and Hong Kong governments insist the city\u2019s national security laws were necessary to return stability to the city after the protests."

      "Perry, who appeared surprised, quickly moved away as she continued singing her 2008 hit \u201cHot N Cold.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s never going to be another show like this, so just enjoy it, Sydney,\u201d she said, as the fan appeared to struggle with security guards.",
      "\u201cWhat the hell is going on?\u201d Perry said to the crowd, as the man was dragged off stage.",
      "A representative for Perry could not immediately be reached for comment.",
      "The incident highlights growing concerns about poor etiquette at concerts, with audience members throwing items at artists such as Harry Styles and Lady Gaga.",
      "Police in the state of New South Wales, which includes Sydney, told NBC News that a man had been arrested and charged with two offenses: entering enclosed land and obstructing a person in performance of work or duties. They said he had been detained by security after jumping on stage during a concert around 9:20 p.m. local time.",
      "The man has been granted conditional bail and is due to appear in court on June 23, police said, declining to name him in the meantime. They said he has also been banned for six months from Sydney Olympic Park, where the arena is located.",
      "The man has been identified in Australian media as Johnson Wen, who describes himself as a \u201cprankster\u201d on his TikTok account, where he goes by the username pyjamamann and has a little over 1,100 followers.",
      "\u201cI was like, \u2018Let me get on stage with you,\u2019 and then she freaked out because I think she realized I wasn\u2019t a performer,\u201d Wen told Australia\u2019s 9News about the incident, adding that he was \u201cabout to do the extra Fortnite move, but security got there too quick.\u201d",
      "Previous videos posted on Wen's account show him running on stage at a concert by The Weeknd in Melbourne last year, and onto the field at the FIFA Women\u2019s World Cup final in 2023.",
      "Wen told 9News that his stage invasion days were over.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m planning to quit forever, because you get in way too much trouble for it,\u201d he said.",
      "Wen did not immediately respond to a request for comment. By Tuesday, he had posted four different videos of his rushing the stage.",
      "\u201cKaty Perry your songs are my Childhood Memmory since 2008,\u201d he wrote in a caption for one of the videos.",
      "\u201cMe Hugging Katy Perry on Stage,\u201d another caption read. \u201cI said to Her \u2018let me dance for you.\u2019\u201d",
      "Perry has not otherwise publicly commented on the incident. Her tour was set to continue Tuesday with another show in Sydney before she continues on to Melbourne, Brisbane, Perth and Adelaide."

    "story": [
      "As U.S. and Chinese negotiators meet for trade talks in London this week, a primary concern for Washington will be whether Beijing eases the flow of rare earth materials, which have become key components of modern life.",
      "China dominates the global supply chain for rare earths, mining about 70% and refining 90% of the materials used to produce everything from wind turbines and defense equipment to electric vehicles and car seats. The United States produces virtually none of the world\u2019s rare earths, whose extraction can be devastating for the environment.",
      "That economic vulnerability has come into sharper focus since April, when China imposed export controls on seven strategic rare earth metals and related magnets amid an escalating trade war with President Donald Trump. Companies, especially automakers and business associations in the U.S., Europe and elsewhere have sounded the alarm, warning that China\u2019s rare earth restrictions risk delays that could bring manufacturing to a halt.",
      "Kevin Hassett, director of the National Economic Council, told CNBC on Monday that U.S. negotiators in London were seeking a \u201chandshake\u201d from China on rare earths after Trump said last week that Chinese President Xi Jinping had agreed to resume their flow in the first call between the two leaders since Trump returned to office.",
      "\u201cThey were kind of releasing them, but it was going a lot slower than some companies believed was optimal,\u201d Hassett said.",
      "In an editorial Monday, the Chinese state-run news agency Xinhua said the rare earth export controls were not a \u201cshort-term bargaining chip\u201d for trade talks but a responsible policy aimed at preventing rare earths, which have both civilian and military uses, \u201cfrom being used in activities that threaten international peace and security.\u201d",
      "\u201cImposing export controls on strategic resources with clear dual-use characteristics is a common international practice and a legitimate right of sovereign nations to safeguard their own security,\u201d the editorial said.",
      "Signs of hope have appeared in recent days. On Saturday, the Chinese Commerce Ministry said it was open to talks on rare earth export controls, and that it \u201cfully considers the legitimate needs and concerns of other countries.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "Iran said Monday that it will soon hand a counterproposal for a nuclear deal to the United States in response to a U.S. offer that Tehran deems \u201cunacceptable,\u201d while U.S. President Donald Trump said talks would continue.",
      "Trump made clear that the two sides remained at odds over whether the country would be allowed to continue enriching uranium on Iranian soil.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re just asking for things that you can\u2019t do. They don\u2019t want to give up what they have to give up,\u201d Trump told reporters at the White House. \u201cThey seek enrichment. We can\u2019t have enrichment.\u201d",
      "Earlier, Iranian foreign ministry spokesperson Esmaeil Baghaei said Tehran was preparing a counteroffer to the U.S. proposal that was presented in late May. He said there was no detail about the timing of a sixth round of talks.",
      "While Trump said the next round of talks would take place Thursday, a senior Iranian official and a U.S. official said Thursday was unlikely.",
      "Following Trump\u2019s remarks, Baghaei said \u201cbased on recent consultations, the next round of Iran\u2013U.S. indirect negotiations is being planned for next Sunday in Muscat,\u201d according to the ministry\u2019s Telegram channel.",
      "The U.S. official said the talks, led by U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff and Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, could be Friday or Sunday, possibly in Oman or Oslo.",
      "\u201cThe U.S. proposal is not acceptable to us. It was not the result of previous rounds of negotiations. We will present our own proposal to the other side via Oman after it is finalized. This proposal is reasonable, logical, and balanced,\u201d Baghaei said.",
      "\u201cWe must ensure before the lifting of sanctions that Iran will effectively benefit economically and that its banking and trade relations with other countries will return to normal.\u201d",
      "Reuters previously reported that Tehran was drafting a negative response to the U.S. proposal. An Iranian diplomat said the U.S. offer failed to resolve differences over uranium enrichment on Iranian soil, the shipment abroad of Iran\u2019s entire stockpile of highly enriched uranium and reliable steps to lift U.S. sanctions.",
      "Last week, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei dismissed the U.S. proposal as against Iran\u2019s interests, pledging to continue enrichment on Iranian soil, which Western powers view as a potential pathway to building nuclear weapons. Iran says its nuclear program is only for peaceful purposes.",
      "Trump said Iran was the main topic of a phone conversation he had Monday with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Netanyahu\u2019s office said the president had told him talks with Iran would continue at the end of the week.",
      "During his first term in 2018, Trump ditched a 2015 nuclear pact between Iran and six powers and reimposed sanctions that have crippled Iran\u2019s economy. Iran responded by escalating enrichment far beyond that pact\u2019s limits.",
      "Iran says the West has turned a blind eye to Israel\u2019s nuclear program even while pushing against Iran\u2019s. Israel neither confirms nor denies that it has nuclear weapons.",
      "Baghaei said sensitive Israeli documents, which Iran has previously promised to unveil, would demonstrate \u201cthat parties constantly questioning Iran\u2019s peaceful nuclear program actively work to strengthen Israel\u2019s military nuclear program.\u201d",
      "The negotiating parties should not allow Israel to disrupt diplomatic processes, he added."
