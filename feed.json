      "For once, things are working out for Wile E",
      "NEW YORK -- For once, things are working out for Wile E. Coyote.",
      "After being shelved by Warner Bros. in 2023, the Looney Tunes film \u201cCoyote vs. Acme\u201d has found a new home. Ketchup Entertainment announced Monday that it acquired worldwide distribution rights to the film for an undisclosed sum.",
      "The deal gives new life to one of the three fully completed films that Warner Bros. elected to take a tax write-off on rather than release. The tactic, which followed a change in leadership at Warner Bros. coming out of the pandemic, was widely disparaged by creatives and fans, alike. The other two shelved movies \u2014 the $90 million DC Studios production \u201cBatgirl\u201d and the animated \u201cScoob! Holiday Haunt\u201d \u2014 remain unreleased.",
      "But \u201cCoyote vs. Acme\u201d will be salvaged from the dustbin. Ketchup Entertainment plans a theatrical release at an unspecified future date.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re thrilled to have made a deal with Warner Bros. Pictures to bring this film to audiences worldwide,\u201d Gareth West, chief executive of Ketchup Entertainment, said in a statement. \u201c\u2018Coyote vs Acme\u2019 is a perfect blend of nostalgia and modern storytelling, capturing the essence of the beloved Looney Tunes characters while introducing them to a new generation.\u201d",
      "Directed by Dave Green and based on a New Yorker article by Ian Frazier, \u201cCoyote vs. Acme\u201d follows Wile E. Coyote in a lawsuit against Acme Corporation for the many faulty products that failed to catch him the Road Runner. The live-action animated hybrid stars John Cena and Will Forte.",
      "Deadline earlier reported that Ketchup paid about $50 million for the film, which cost $70 million to produce. Ketchup, a distribution company launched in 2012, also recently released another Looney Tunes film jettisoned by Warner Bros.: \u201cThe Day the Earth Blew Up: A Looney Tunes Movie.\u201d In three weeks of release, it's grossed $8.2 million in domestic ticket sales.",

      "LONDON -- The makers of hit Netflix show \u201cAdolescence \u201d have sparked a conversation on how to protect children from violent misogyny and other harmful content on social media.",
      "Now they have the ear of British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who welcomed the filmmakers to Downing Street on Monday for talks on child protection. Starmer's office said he backed an initiative by Netflix to stream the drama series for free to secondary schools across the country, so that as many children as possible can watch it.",
      "The show, filmed in England, explores the difficult questions that arise when a 13-year-old boy is accused of stabbing a girl in his school to death. It has been watched by more than 66 million people worldwide since it launched earlier in March.",
      "Starmer said it was difficult watching the series with his 14-year-old daughter and 16-year-old son. But showing it widely in schools will \u201chelp students better understand the impact of misogyny, dangers of online radicalization and the importance of healthy relationships,\u201d his office said.",
      "Starmer added in a statement: \u201cThis isn\u2019t a challenge politicians can simply legislate for. Believe me, if I could pull a lever to solve it, I would.\"",
      "Jack Thorne, a co-writer of the show, said the team behind \u201cAdolescence\u201d made it to provoke a conversation.",
      "\u201cSo to have the opportunity to take this into schools is beyond our expectations,\u201d he said. \"We hope it\u2019ll lead to teachers talking to the students, but what we really hope is it\u2019ll lead to students talking amongst themselves.\u201d",
      "Stephen Graham, a co-creator of the drama who stars as the boy's father, has told The Associated Press he wanted the narrative to focus on the seemingly ordinary life of the accused.",
      "He said that when a knife crime among young people takes place, the first reaction may be to question the background of the murder suspect and how they were raised.",
      "\u201cBut what if it's not the family?\u201d he asked, adding: \u201cWe\u2019re all maybe accountable. School. Society. Parents. Community.\u201d",
      "The success of \u201cAdolescence\u201d has come during growing concern over children's use of smartphones and the easy availability of pornography and extreme misogynistic content on social media pushed by influencers like Andrew Tate. Tate and his brother, Tristan, who are dual U.S. and British citizens, face charges of human trafficking and forming an organized criminal group to sexually exploit women.",
      "Gavin Stephens, chair of the National Police Chiefs' Council, warned last week that \u201cthe harmful effect of Tate is plain to see.\u201d",
      "Police in the U.K. are now dealing with more than a million crimes related to violence against women and girls each year, or a fifth of all recorded crime.",

      "NEW YORK -- In an unexpected upset, the Jason Statham thriller \u201cA Working Man\u201d took No. 1 at the box office, besting the rapidly declining \u201cSnow White,\u201d according to studio estimates Sunday.",
      "Even after a lackluster debut, the Walt Disney Co.\u2019s live-action remake was predicted to remain the top film in U.S. and Canadian theaters over the weekend. Instead, \u201cSnow White,\u201d plagued by bad buzz and backlash, nosedived in its second weekend and dropped 66%.",
      "At the same time, Amazon MGM Studios\u2019 \u201cA Working Man,\u201d directed by David Ayer, beat expectations with a $15.2 million debut.

      "While reviews have been mixed and audiences only gave \u201cA Working Man\u201d a \u201cB\u201d CinemaScore, showing Statham has carved out something rare in the movie industry today: bankability. \u201cA Working Man\u201d opened similarly to \u201cThe Beekeeper,\u201d which launched with $16.5 million.",
      "The bigger headline, though, might have been the fast erosion of ticket buyers' appetite for \u201cSnow White.\u201d The film, directed by Marc Webb and starring Rachel Zegler, had been hoped to lift movie theaters after a painful start to 2025. Produced for more $250 million, the film has turned into a poisoned apple, with a two-week global haul of $143.1 million.",

      "\u201cThe Chosen: The Last Supper,\u201d fared the best, with $11.5 million in 2,235 theaters. The Christian TV series, now in its fifth season, has regularly driven ticket sales before streaming. More episodes will roll out in theaters through April.",
      "\u201cDeath of a Unicorn,\u201d a horror comedy starring Jenna Ortega and Paul Rudd, portrays a father and daughter who hit a unicorn on the road while they're driving. The movie collected a modest $5.8 million from 3,050 theaters.",
      "The weekend\u2019s more straightforward horror contender, Blumhouse\u2019s \u201cThe Woman in the Yard,\u201d starring Danielle Deadwyler, debuted with $9.4 million from 2,842 cinemas. In \u201cBlack Adam\u201d director Jaume Collet-Serra\u2019s film, a mysterious woman keeps appearing in a family\u2019s front yard. Though it cost little to make, with a production budget of $12 million, it has been slammed by critics.",

      "LOS ANGELES -- Richard Chamberlain, the handsome hero of the 1960s television series \"Dr. Kildare\" who found a second career as an award-winning \"king of the miniseries,\" has died. He was 90.",
      "Chamberlain died Saturday night in Waimanalo, Hawaii, of complications following a stroke, according to his publicist, Harlan Boll.",
      "\u201cOur beloved Richard is with the angels now. He is free and soaring to those loved ones before us,\" Martin Rabbett, his lifelong partner, said in a statement. \"How blessed were we to have known such an amazing and loving soul. Love never dies. And our love is under his wings lifting him to his next great adventure.\u201d",
      "Tall, with classic good looks and romantic style, Chamberlain became an instant favorite with teenage girls as the compassionate physician on the TV series that aired from 1961 to 1966. Photoplay magazine named him most popular male star for three years in a row, from 1963-65.",
      "Not until 2003 did he acknowledge publicly what Hollywood insiders had long known, that he was gay. He made the revelation in his autobiography, \"Shattered Love.\"",
      "The actor became known as \"king of the TV miniseries\" in 1978 when he landed the starring role in \"Centennial,\" an epic production 24 hours long and based on James Michener's sprawling novel. He followed that in 1980 with \"Shogun,\" another costly, epic miniseries based on James Clavell's period piece about an American visitor to Japan.",
      "He scored his greatest miniseries success in 1983 with another long-form drama, \"The Thorn Birds,\" based on Colleen McCullough's best-seller. He played Father Ralph de Bricassart, a Roman Catholic priest in Australia who falls in love with beautiful Meggie Cleary (Rachel Ward). The ABC production, which also starred Barbara Stanwyck, reportedly attracted 100 million viewers.",
      "Chamberlain won Golden Globes for his work in \u201cShogun\" and \u201cThe Thorn Birds.\u201d Years earlier, he received one for \u201cDr. Kildare.\u201d",
      "When the public began to lose interest in miniseries, Chamberlain turned to the theater, where he displayed a fine singing voice. He appeared as Henry Higgins in a 1994 Broadway revival of \"My Fair Lady\" and as Captain von Trapp in a 1999 revival of \"The Sound of Music.\"",
      "He reprised his role of de Bricassart in the 1996 TV movie \"The Thorn Birds: The Missing Years.\"",
      "He also appeared in numerous films, including \"The Music Lovers\" (as Tchaikovsky), \"The Madwoman of Chaillot,\" \"The Towering Inferno\" and \"The Three Musketeers\" and its sequels.",
      "The \"Kildare\" series was based on a string of successful 1930s and '40s films that had starred Lew Ayres in the title role.",
      "Chamberlain's hunky, all-American appearance made him an overnight star. Another medical show that debuted the same season, \"Ben Casey,\" also was a smash and made its leading man, the darkly handsome Vince Edwards, a star, too.",
      "The \"Ben Casey shirt\" became a fashion item, both shows' theme songs made the pop Top 40 (the Kildare song performed by Chamberlain himself) and there was even a pop song called \"Dr. Kildare! Dr. Casey! You Are Wanted for Consultation.\"",
      "But in his book, Chamberlain recounted how he was forced to hide his sexuality. He would escort glamorous actresses to movie premieres and other public events at the request of studio executives and dodge reporters' questions about why he had never married with a stock reply: \"Getting married would be great, but I'm awfully busy now.\"",
      "\"When I grew up, being gay, being a sissy or anything like that was verboten,\" he said in an NBC interview. \"I disliked myself intensely and feared this part of myself intensely and had to hide it.\"",
      "The book also described a troubled childhood and an alcoholic father, and Chamberlain said that writing it finally lifted a heavy emotional burden. He also expressed relief that he was no longer hiding his sexuality.",
      "\"I played a cat-and-mouse game with the press. Game over,\" said Chamberlain.",
      "Born George Richard Chamberlain in Beverly Hills on March 31, 1934, the actor originally studied at Pomona College to be a painter. But after returning from the Army, where he had served as an infantry clerk in the Korean War, Chamberlain decided to try acting.",
      "He studied voice and drama, and after appearing in guest roles in a handful of TV shows and in the 1960 film \"The Secret of the Purple Reef,\" he won the Dr. Kildare role.",
      "When \u201cDr. Kildare\u201d was canceled he initially found it difficult to shake the image of the handsome young physician.",
      "He moved to England for a time to find work and hone his acting skills. While there, he appeared in three of director Richard Lester\u2019s films, \u201cPetulia\u201d (1968), \u201cThe Three Musketeers\u201d (1973) and \u201cThe Four Musketeers\u201d (1974). He reunited with Lester in 1989 for \u201cThe Return of the Musketeers,\u201d once more playing Aramis.",
      "In 1969, Chamberlain played the title role in \u201cHamlet\u201d at England\u2019s Birmingham Repertory Company and repeated it in a TV adaptation that appeared on NBC in the United States. He also appeared as Octavius in a film version of \u201cJulius Caesar,\u201d which co-starred Charlton Heston and Jason Robards.",
      "He continued to act well into the 21st century, appearing on such television shows as \u201cWill & Grace,\u201d \u201cThe Drew Carey Show\u201d and \u201cTouched by an Angel.\u201d",

      "On Friday, more than 600 of the academy's 11,000 members issued an open letter saying the academy's statement \"fell far short of the sentiments this moment calls for.\u201d Among the signatories were Joaquin Phoenix, Olivia Colman, Riz Ahmed, Emma Thompson, Javier Bardem, Pen\u00e9lope Cruz and \u201cThe Zone of Interest\u201d filmmaker Jonathan Glazer.",
      "After a meeting Friday by the academy's board of governors, Kramer and Yang responded with a new statement.",
      "\u201cWe sincerely apologize to Mr. Ballal and all artists who felt unsupported by our previous statement and want to make it clear that the academy condemns violence of this kind anywhere in the world,\u201d they wrote to members. \"We abhor the suppression of free speech under any circumstances.\u201d",
      "After being detained for more than 20 hours, Ballal was released by Israeli soldiers. Ballal and two other Palestinians were accused of throwing stones at a settler, allegations they deny. After being released, Ballal told The Associated Press a settler kicked his head \u201clike a football\u201d during an attack on his village.",
      "\u201cI realized they were attacking me specifically,\u201d Ballal said at a West Bank hospital after his release Tuesday. \u201cWhen they say \u2018Oscar\u2019, you understand. When they say your name, you understand.\u201d",
      "\u201cNo Other Land,\u201d a joint Israeli-Palestinian production, chronicles the situation in Masafer Yatta, which the Israeli military designated as a live-fire training zone in the 1980s and ordered the expulsion of the residents, mostly Arab Bedouin. Around 1,000 residents have largely remained in place, but soldiers regularly come in to demolish homes, tents, water tanks and olive orchards.",
      "After not finding a U.S. distributor despite wide acclaim, \u201cNo Other Land\u201d was self-released in theaters. It still managed to surpass $2 million in North American theaters.",

      "Yes, he pulled his punches a bit just like the real stars \u2014 Gronkowski rattled off wrestling favorites ranging from Val Venis to the bad boys of Degeneration X \u2014 but there was nothing phony about his love of WWE.",
      "\u201cWe just loved what the WWE brought to our childhood,\u201d the retired New England Patriots tight end said. \u201cThe characters. It wasn\u2019t even about the fights in the ring. It was how awesome these guys as personalities were.\u201d",

      "While pro wrestling is built on the swerve \u2014 the art of delivering fans the unexpected \u2014 Gronkowski said he would not compete at WrestleMania, citing his brother\u2019s wedding on that Saturday night.",
      "\u201cI will not be in the ring at WrestleMania,\u201d he said. \u201cI really wish I could possibly do something.\u201d",

      "The Sex Pistols will tour North America for the first time since 2003 this fall",
      "NEW YORK -- It wasn't the night punk broke, but it was close. Nearly 50 years ago, the Sex Pistols \u2014 then made up of vocalist Johnny Rotten, guitarist Steve Jones, drummer Paul Cook and bassist Glen Matlock \u2014 performed at the 100 Club Punk Special in London, a 140-capacity club, alongside Subway Sect, Siouxsie and the Banshees and The Clash.",
      "The event marked a shift for the subcultural movement; the bands here would soon bring their underground culture to reach mainstream heights.",
      "Now, the 2025 iteration of the Pistols \u2014 Jones, Cooke and Matlock joined by frontman Frank Carter (of Gallows, Pure Love and Frank Carter and the Rattlesnakes) \u2014 sit in the same venue to discuss their forthcoming North American tour. \u201cThis is where it all kicked off, really, all the punk,\u201d says Cook.",
      "This fall, the legendary punk band will embark on their first tour of North America since 2003, when they were joined by John Lydon (formerly Rotten.) The 2025 run with Carter begins Sept. 16 at the Longhorn Ballroom in Dallas, Texas \u2014 the site of a particularly hostile show for the band when it first toured the U.S. in 1978.",
      "Jones recalls having \u201cpigs' hooves and bottles and what not slung at us by cowboys.\u201d",
      "It is one of a few dates featured in three \u201cLive in the U.S.A.\u201d albums, documenting the band's '78 run: Atlanta, Dallas and San Francisco. The latter will release April 25 and captures the show where the band originally called it quits.",
      "\"We were thinking of breaking up in San Francisco again,\" Jones jokes.",
      "The 2025 tour is currently scheduled to conclude Oct. 16 at the Hollywood Palladium in Los Angeles. The band will hit Washington; Philadelphia; Brooklyn, New York; Montreal; Toronto; Cleveland; Detroit; Minneapolis; Denver; Seattle and San Francisco. Additional tour dates will be announced later.",
      "Pre-sale opens April 2 and 3. Tickets go on sale April 4 at 10 a.m. local time.",
      "They will perform the band's sole album, 1977\u2019s \u201cNever Mind the Bollocks, Here\u2019s the Sex Pistols Album\u201d live in its entirety as well as other material.",
      "So, why tour the U.S. and Canada now?",
      "\u201cWhy not?\u201d says Jones.",
      "\u201cI think everybody needs this band right now. I think the world needs this band right now,\u201d says Carter. \u201cAnd I think definitely America is screaming out for a band like the Sex Pistols.\u201d",
      "\u201cAt the end of the day, we\u2019re living in a really, really difficult time. So not only do people want to come and just be entertained, they want to enjoy themselves,\u201d he continued. \u201cPunk is an energetic music. It\u2019s one where you can go and vent and let your hair down, hopefully in a safe manner. Fingers crossed, no bottles or pigs' hooves.\u201d",
      "Carter fronted the Sex Pistols last year for a few U.K. dates. The band says they did not reach out to Lydon to see if he wanted to participate in this reunion tour.",
      "\u201cThe last thing he wants to do is have anything to do with us right now,\u201d says Jones, referring to a previous lawsuit between the singer and the band over music use in their TV series \u201cPistol.\u201d The judge ruled against Lydon's opposition.",
      "\u201cWe wish him the best,\" Jones said.",
      "\u201cGood luck to him,\u201d adds Matlock. \u201cI wish he thinks, maybe, \u2018good luck\u2019 to us. Probably doesn't. But over the years, John (has had) all our phone numbers, and I can't see many missed calls from him.\u201d",
      "As for the 2025 tour: Fans shouldn't expect the violence of their 1978 run, but they should anticipate a tighter performance.",
      "\u201cWe're a bit older but we play just as well, if not better,\u201d says Matlock. \u201cAnd I think that\u2019s something that\u2019s got a great deal of aplomb that we\u2019re going to bring to the public over there.\u201d",
      "Does this mean there could be new Sex Pistols music in the future? \u201cIt's early days,\u201d says Jones. \u201cLet's see what happens.\u201d",

      "At Hong Kong\u2019s Art Basel, painter Chow Chun-fai\u2019s new works transport viewers back to the night in 1997 when the former British colony returned to Chinese rule, displayed in the very exhibition center where one era ended and another began",
      "HONG KONG -- At Hong Kong\u2019s Art Basel, painter Chow Chun-fai\u2019s new works transport viewers back to the night in 1997 when the former British colony returned to Chinese rule, displayed in the very exhibition center where one era ended and another began.",
      "That transformation in the city's post-colonial era has taken a drastic turn since 2020, when China imposed a national security law that virtually wiped out dissent. The law drove many middle-class families and young professionals, including artists, to emigrate to democracies like Britain, Canada, Taiwan and the U.S. from what was once a haven for free expression in Asia.",
      "But others, like Chow, chose to stay and continue to document their home city despite unclear red lines. His works at Art Basel, which opens to the public on Friday, revisit Hong Kongers\u2019 collective memories of the late 1990s and early 2000s, a time many were proud of the Chinese financial hub\u2019s vibrancy and openness.",
      "\u201cWhile studying art, we\u2019ve learned many artists faced momentous times. Since we are living through such a momentous time ourselves now, I will continue to learn from it,\" he said in an interview ahead of the exhibition.",
      "Chow is perhaps best known to those outside art circles for his witty recreations of classic movie scenes with bilingual subtitles that lead audiences to reflect on Hong Kong's history and identity. He was also in the news when he ran against pro-establishment candidates in the 2012 legislative election and the 2016 election committee race, though he ultimately lost both contests.",
      "At Art Basel, Chow's paintings revisit significant news events, from the 1997 handover and overseas trips made by former top Chinese leaders to the celebration of China becoming the host of the 2008 Olympic Games.",
      "His works center on some of the biggest news stories covered by Sharon Cheung, a former journalist and now local gallery director.",
      "In 2000, late former Chinese President Jiang Zemin berated Cheung for asking what he called \u201ctoo simple, sometimes naive\u201d questions. She'd asked Jiang if his support for then-Hong Kong leader Tung Chee-hwa gave the impression of an imperial-style appointment. One of Chow\u2019s paintings illustrates that scene.",
      "Another set of Chow's paintings that will be shown, titled \u201cPanda,\u201d captures Jiang\u2019s personality from another side, documenting his light-hearted response to a question about pandas during a 2002 U.S. trip. He replied in English with a laugh: \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I am an electrical power engineer.\" Zhang said he was not a panda expert and quoted a Confucian saying about the virtue of acknowledging what one doesn\u2019t know.",
      "Chow said he included the work in the exhibition because pandas have become a trending topic in Hong Kong, where twins born last year sparked a bear craze. Jiang's response shows the characteristics of Chinese leaders back then, he said.",
      "Some 20 years later, Chinese leaders no longer have such open exchanges with Hong Kong journalists. Last year, China\u2019s government even eliminated an annual news conference by the premier, one of the rare times a top Chinese leader took questions from journalists.",
      "In Hong Kong, Beijing has doubled down on its control following 2019 anti-government protests. Many leading pro-democracy activists were prosecuted and jailed under the security law. Apple Daily and Stand News, news outlets known for their critical reports of the government, were shut down in 2021 after their top editors were arrested.",
      "The cultural sector has felt the chilling effect.",
      "In 2021, the government introduced amendments to its film censorship law on national security grounds. Some filmmakers have stopped screening their work in the city. Cultural works that diverge from government positions have lost funding. Booksellers practice self-censorship at the city's book fair, and local libraries in 2023 pulled titles related to the 1989 Tiananmen Square crackdown in Beijing and some political figures.",
      "Cheung, director of SC Gallery, said people have become more cautious about expressing their thoughts, but that she and Chow will not let fear stop them. Art\u2019s sense of distance allows room for interpretation, Cheung said.",
      "\u201cWe're not trying to tell people something. It's more about what people take away when they look at these images,\u201d she said.",
      "Chow said he never planned to leave Hong Kong despite the city's drastic changes, noting that artists who lived through major changes in the past produced great work.",
      "\u201cToday, finding ourselves in this moment of transformation, how could I, as a creative professional, not be here to witness it personally?\u201d he said.",

      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump on Thursday revealed his intention to force changes at the Smithsonian Institution with an executive order that targets funding for programs that advance \u201cdivisive narratives\u201d and \u201cimproper ideology,\" the latest step in a broadside against culture he deems too liberal.",
      "Trump claimed there has been a \u201cconcerted and widespread\u201d effort over the past decade to rewrite American history by replacing \u201cobjective facts\u201d with a \u201cdistorted narrative driven by ideology rather than truth,\" adding that it casts the \u201cfounding principles\u201d of the United States in a \u201cnegative light.\u201d",
      "The order he signed behind closed doors puts Vice President JD Vance, who serves on the Smithsonian Institution's Board of Regents, in charge of overseeing efforts to \u201cremove improper ideology\u201d from all areas of the institution, including its museums, education and research centers, and the National Zoo.",
      "It marks the Republican president's latest salvo against cultural pillars of society, such as universities and art, that he considers out of step with conservative sensibilities. Trump recently had himself installed as chairman of the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts with the aim of overhauling programming, including the annual Kennedy Center Honors awards show. The administration also recently forced Columbia University to make a series of policy changes by threatening the Ivy League school with the loss of several hundred million dollars in federal funding.",
      "The executive order also hints at the return of statues and monuments of Confederate figures, many of which were taken down or replaced around the country after the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis in 2020 and the rise of the Black Lives Matter movement, which is detested by Trump and other conservatives.",
      "The order also calls for improvements to Independence Hall in Philadelphia by July 4, 2026, in time for the 250th anniversary of the signing of the Declaration of Independence.",
      "Trump singled out the National Museum of African American History and Culture, which opened in 2016 near the White House, the Women's History Museum, which is in development, and the American Art Museum for criticism.",
      "\u201cMuseums in our Nation's capital should be places where individuals go to learn \u2014 not to be subjected to ideological indoctrination or divisive narratives that distort our shared history,\u201d he said.",
      "Linda St. Thomas, the Smithsonian Institution\u2019s chief spokesperson, said in an email late Thursday, \u201cWe have no comment for now.\u201d",
      "Under Trump\u2019s order, Vance will also work with the White House budget office to make sure future funding for the Smithsonian Institution isn\u2019t spent on programs that \u201cdegrade shared American values, divide Americans based on race, or promote programs or ideologies inconsistent with federal law and policy.\u201d Trump also wants to ensure that the women\u2019s history museum celebrates women and not \u201crecognize men as women in any respect.\u201d",
      "It also requires the interior secretary to reinstate monuments, memorials, statues and similar properties that have been removed or changed since Jan. 1, 2020, to \u201cperpetuate a false reconstruction of American history, inappropriately minimize the value of certain historical events or figures, or include any other improper partisan ideology.\u201d",
      "The Smithsonian Institution is the world\u2019s largest museum, education and research complex. It consists of 21 museums and the National Zoo. Eleven museums are located along the National Mall in Washington.",

      "Yolanda Sald\u00edvar, 64, was up for parole for the first time since the killing of the singer, known to fans as simply Selena.",
      "One of the first Mexican American artists to break into the mainstream music scene, Selena shattered barriers for women in Latin music. She was 23 years old and on the verge of crossing over into English-language pop superstardom when she was killed.",
      "The singer's family and Chris P\u00e9rez, her widower, expressed gratitude to the Texas Board of Pardon and Paroles.",
      "\u201cWhile nothing can bring Selena back, this decision reaffirms that justice continues to stand for the beautiful life that was taken from us and from millions of fans around the world far too soon,\u201d they said in a statement posted on social media.",
      "In explaining the decision to deny parole, the board said in a statement that the panel found that Sald\u00edvar continues to pose a threat to public safety. It also said the nature of the crime indicated \u201ca conscious disregard for the lives, safety, or property of others.\u201d",
      "Sald\u00edvar, who is serving her sentence in a Gatesville prison, will be eligible to be reviewed again for parole in 2030.",
      "Sald\u00edvar founded Selena\u2019s fan club and was the manager of the singer\u2019s clothing boutiques, Selena Etc., until she was fired in early March 1995 after money was discovered missing.",
      "Selena, a Corpus Christi native, was shot in the back with a .38-caliber revolver at a Days Inn motel in Corpus Christi on March 31, 1995. She was able to run to the motel lobby, where she collapsed, and she was pronounced dead at a hospital an hour later.",

      "More than 50,000 people lined up to view Selena\u2019s body the day before she was laid to rest in Seaside Memorial Park on April 3, 1995, just 13 days before her 24th birthday.",
      "Sald\u00edvar\u2019s trial was moved to Houston because of the publicity surrounding the case. Sald\u00edvar testified that she had intended to kill herself during the confrontation with Selena but the gun misfired.",
      "On Oct. 23, 1995, a jury convicted Sald\u00edvar of first-degree murder. She was sentenced to life in prison with the possibility of parole after 30 years.",
      "While in prison, Sald\u00edvar, a former nurse, obtained her paralegal and associate degree in criminal justice. She has filed several civil rights complaints alleging mistreatment by the state\u2019s prison system, according to court records, and she also helped other inmates file petitions.",
      "In court documents from 2016, Sald\u00edvar said she was being held in protective custody \u2014 meaning she was segregated from other inmates \u2014 because prison officials were concerned for her safety due to the \u201chigh profile\u201d nature of her case. She filed several appeals of her conviction, but all were rejected.",
      "Known as \u201cthe Queen of Tejano,\u201d Selena rose to stardom and won a Grammy during a Tejano music boom in the early 1990s. Her hits included \u201cBidi Bidi Bom Bom,\u201d \u201cComo la Flor,\u201d \u201cAmor Prohibido,\u201d \u201cNo Me Queda Mas\u201d and \u201cTu Solo Tu.\u201d",
      "She opened the floodgates for a new generation of contemporary artists of Latin descent who would go on to enjoy huge popularity with mainstream American audiences. She often sang in Spanish and spoke in English, reflecting a cross-cultural identity that resonated with listeners.",

      "\u201cASCO: Without Permission\u201d is director Travis Guti\u00e9rrez Senger's latest documentary and executive produced by Gael Garcia Bernal and Diego Luna",
      "LOS ANGELES -- When filmmaker Travis Guti\u00e9rrez Senger reflects on ASCO\u2019s legacy, he quickly notes they were more than an art group; they created a movement, one with remarkable influence on Chicano art history.",
      "\u201cThat movement continues today, and it\u2019s very expansive,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of books, films and things that will be written about ASCO over a period of time. And this was our contribution in some ways.\u201d",
      "He's referring to \u201cASCO: Without Permission,\u201d a documentary that chronicles the story of the 1970s art group founded by multidisciplinary artist Patssi Valdez, muralist Willie Herr\u00f3n III, painter and performance artist Gronk and writer and photographer Harry Gamboa Jr. They met as teens, formed as young adults, and called their group \u201casco\u201d \u2014 \u201cnausea\u201d or \u201cdisgust\u201d in Spanish \u2014 after one of their early DIY exhibits. Their conceptual work and performance art spoke to the exclusion of Chicanos from the mainstream art world and the systemic police brutality endured by the Mexican American community in East Los Angeles.",
      "All four founding members of ASCO became some of the most notable Chicano artists, later exhibiting works in revered museums around the United States. But in their early days, the group was denied access to the notable galleries and museums. They created their own avenues in the form of public performances, murals and more to exhibit their work, their way.",
      "\u201cTo behave badly is the most ethical thing you can do,\u201d said executive producer Gael Garc\u00eda Bernal at the film\u2019s South by Southwest film festival premiere earlier this month. \u201cYou\u2019re building identity and questioning and unmasking the facade and the farce that exists.\u201d",
      "Bernal and Diego Luna executive produced the film under their production company El Corriente del Golfo. The film has yet to find distribution.",
      "Speaking with The Associated Press, Gamboa and Valdez praised Guti\u00e9rrez Senger\u2019s approach to their history. Both members, who appear in the documentary, saw the film for the first time with a crowd of fans and a group of young Chicano artists whose art was inspired by ASCO\u2019s early rebellion.",
      "\u201cI felt the film really kind of captured the essence of all of us working together,\u201d said Gamboa.",
      "Valdez says it was a special moment for her, as the only woman in the founding group, to be given equal time and understanding.",
      "\u201cFor the first time, I was given an equal voice in the group that hadn\u2019t happened before,\u201d she said, citing how previous stories of the group only highlighted her male collaborators.",
      "ASCO emerged at the height of the Chicano civil rights movement in the 1960s and 1970s. It was a time of heightened political and racial tension amid the East LA walkouts, protesting education inequality, and the Chicano Moratorium, an anti-Vietnam War movement during which many Mexican Americans were victims of police brutality.",
      "Muralists and collectives popped up as Latino artists sought to process the systemic injustice taking place in their communities.",
      "\u201cThe response to such violence was to create art,\u201d said Gamboa Jr. He wanted to alter the mainstream perception of Chicanos and present the possibilities and avenues someone can create despite societal constraints.",
      "For Valdez, being the only woman meant she was no stranger to a double dose of both racism in society and the sexism weaved within conservative Latino households, where young women were expected to keep quiet.",
      "\u201cI couldn\u2019t stand it. So, I was able to act out these forms of censorship through the performance work in ASCO,\u201d said Valdez who once taped herself to a public wall in a piece titled \u201cInstant Mural,\u201d a metaphor on feeling captive.",
      "One of ASCO's most known works is \u201cSpray Paint LACMA.\u201d Gamboa, Gronk and Herr\u00f3n spray painted their names on the side of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art after Gamboa says he was told by a curator, \u201cChicanos are in gangs, they don\u2019t make art.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere was another era when people said, \u2018Latinx art, you know, doesn\u2019t exist. It\u2019s not a thing. It doesn\u2019t belong. It\u2019s not part of American art,\u2019\u201d said Pilar Tompkins-Rivas, the chief curator and deputy director of the Lucas Museum of Narrative Art.",
      "ASCO\u2019s neighborhood performance art would often draw stares, and even crowds. In \u201cStation of the Cross,\u201d the group carried a large cross to the local military recruiting office to protest the Vietnam War.",
      "In 1974, Gamboa took a photo of Gronk posed as the victim of gang violence to bring attention to the media\u2019s sensationalist coverage of crime in East Los Angeles. In the documentary, Gamboa claims that a local news station ran the piece as an actual story.",
      "ASCO\u2019s work as a group remained in obscurity from the mainstream. It was not until 2011 when LACMA mounted \u201cASCO: Elite of the Obscure, A Retrospective, 1972-1887,\u201d the first retrospective to present the group\u2019s performance and conceptual art. On display was an image of Valdez, taken by Gamboa, standing above the graffiti art. Life had presented ASCO with its full-circle moment.",
      "\u201cLatino history has always been erased,\u201d said Guti\u00e9rrez Senger. \u201c\u2018ASCO: Without Permission\u2019 is a story of winning a battle, not a war.\u201d",
      "A 1974 photograph of Valdez shows the artist glammed up in a gold top, holding a golden statue of a cobra. She had won best actress at the Aztlan No Movie Awards \u2014 a fictional award show ASCO created as commentary on the lack of Latino representation in Hollywood.",
      "The group was inspired by Hollywood cinema and popular culture, but knew the likelihood of starring in studio films was limited, unless they wanted to play a maid, cartel leader or gang member.",
      "\u201cHollywood movies, rock \u2019n\u2019 roll. That\u2019s what I was about,\u201d said Valdez. \u201cAnd that\u2019s why I responded in the way I did with my artmaking.\u201d",
      "Gamboa photographed Herr\u00f3n, Gronk and Valdez using cinema stock to capture the essence of their favorite films. The series was called \u201cNo Movies\u201d and later inspired their satirical award show.",
      "Guti\u00e9rrez Senger was drawn to it and pays homage throughout the documentary by featuring a group of young Chicano artists \u2014 including local Los Angeles artists like Fabi Reyna and San Cha \u2014 in short films inspired by ASCO\u2019s signature DIY style.",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s a necessary obligation as a Latino if you\u2019re making films to fight very, very hard to put brown people on screen and behind the camera and to try to create films about our history,\u201d said Guti\u00e9rrez Senger. \u201cWe have rich stories, and we have a rich history.\u201d",
      "\u201cASCO: Without Permission\u201d includes testimonials from respected Latino artists, including actor Michael Pe\u00f1a and comedian Arturo Castro, who have broken into the mainstream but know the importance of preserving history.",
      "\u201cOur history as Latinos is not in the history books. The movements that we've had are not in the history books,\u201d Pe\u00f1a says in the documentary.",
      "Although it often feels like progression is slow, Valdez says artists need to continue to voice their opinions and \u201cmisbehave and not ask for permission.\u201d",
      "\u201cYou do not need permission to be yourself. You do not need permission to be creative. You do not need permission to be intellectual,\u201d said Gamboa. \u201cAnd the thing is, you cannot allow yourself to be repressed or silenced and or visually curtailed from presenting works.\u201d",

      "Thirty years ago, music legend Selena Quintanilla-P\u00e9rez was killed by her fan club\u2019s president, Yolanda Sald\u00edvar. For the last three decades, Sald\u00edvar has served her life sentence in Texas.",
      "Now 64, Sald\u00edvar has a petition for parole under review, according to Texas Department of Criminal Justice online records. On Sunday, she is up for parole for the very first time.",
      "According to a spokeswoman for the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles, her case will be voted on or around then, but there's no exact date for the decision to be released.",
      "Here's everything you need to know about Selena, Sald\u00edvar and the parole process in Texas:",
      "Born in 1971, Quintanilla-P\u00e9rez demonstrated an incredible vocal gift in childhood, fronting Selena y Los Dinos with her siblings A.B. and Suzette Quintanilla.",
      "Her superstardom arrived in the early 1990s, with her unique blend of Tejano, pop, cumbia and other musical styles manifesting in huge hits like \u201cBidi Bidi Bom Bom,\u201d \u201cComo la Flor,\u201d \u201cAmor Prohibido,\u201d \u201cNo Me Queda Mas\u201d and \u201cTu Solo Tu.\u201d",
      "Known the world over as The Queen of Tejano, or even more simply just as Selena, she broke barriers for women in Latin music. She opened the floodgates for a new generation of contemporary artists of Latin descent who would go on to enjoy huge popularity with mainstream American audiences. She often sang in Spanish and spoke in English, reflecting a cross-cultural identity that resonated with listeners.",
      "She won her first Grammy in 1994 for best Mexican/Mexican-American album for \u201cLive,\u201d becoming the first female Tejano artist to win the category. She was just 23 when she was killed the following year. But her legacy endures for Mexican Americans, Mexicans, Texans, Latinos and beyond.",
      "Her posthumous English-language crossover album released a few months after her death, \u201cDreaming of You,\u201d topped the Billboard 200, featuring hits like \u201cI Could Fall in Love\u201d and \u201cDreaming of You.\" In 1997, a biographical film about her life, \u201cSelena,\" would quickly become a classic, further launching the career of lead Jennifer Lopez.",
      "In 2017, she received a posthumous star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. At the time, according to a Hollywood Chamber of Commerce spokesperson, the crowd was the largest-ever for a Walk of Fame ceremony, breaking a 1998 record set by onlookers at the unveiling of the star for Mexican singer Vicente Fern\u00e1ndez.",
      "In 2021, she received a posthumous lifetime achievement award from the Grammys. There was no tribute.",
      "Yolanda Sald\u00edvar, a former nurse, was the founder and president of Selena's fan club. She was also a manager of Selena\u2019s clothing boutiques, Selena Etc., but was fired in early 1995 after money was discovered missing.",
      "On March 31, 1995, Selena went to Sald\u00edvar's room at the Days Inn motel in Corpus Christi, Texas, to pick up business records she needed for a tax filing, according to court testimony. A confrontation followed.",
      "Selena was shot in the back with a .38-caliber revolver in the motel room, ran outside and collapsed in the lobby. She was rushed to a nearby hospital and pronounced dead about an hour later.",
      "Motel employees testified Selena named \u201cYolanda\u201d in \u201croom 158\u201d as her attacker.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to do it. I didn\u2019t mean to kill anybody,\u201d a sobbing Sald\u00edvar said during a 9-hour standoff with police, during which she held a gun to her head. She told police she had bought the .38-caliber revolver to kill herself.",
      "The trial was moved to Houston because of heavy publicity.",
      "Prosecutors contended that Sald\u00edvar shot the 23-year-old after the singer\u2019s family suspected her of embezzling $30,000. The defense argued the gun went off accidentally.",
      "On October 23, 1995, the jury convicted Sald\u00edvar of first-degree murder. She was sentenced to life in prison, with the possibility of parole after 30 years \u2014 beginning in 2025.",
      "Sald\u00edvar did not face the death penalty because the crime contained none of the aggravating circumstances required under Texas law, such as a multiple murder or a murder committed during a robbery.",
      "In 1999, the Court of Criminal Appeals in Austin turned down Sald\u00edvar\u2019s first plea for a new trial. In 2000, her lawyer Bill Berchelmann asked the state to revisit the trial. He argued that prosecutors wrongly dismissed potential jurors because of race, did not disclose the criminal record of a witness and made improper comments in court. He said police also violated Sald\u00edvar's rights by interrogating her after she asked for an attorney.",
      "In 2009, Sald\u00edvar lost an appeal because it was filed in the wrong county. She had asked the court to order an appeal filed nine years earlier in Nueces County to move forward, but the state\u2019s highest criminal appeals court said it should have been filed in Harris County, where she was tried and convicted.",
      "She's incarcerated at the Patrick L. O\u2019Daniel prison unit in Gatesville, Texas, about 90 minutes north of Austin.",
      "In Texas, the parole division of the state\u2019s Department of Criminal Justice identifies inmates six months before the date of their initial parole eligibility and pulls their case file for review. Notice of an inmate\u2019s eligibility for parole is sent to officials involved in the trial, any victims and victims' family members.",
      "An institutional parole officer with the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles interviews an inmate and prepares a summary for the board. The victim or the victim\u2019s family members can provide a written statement and can appear in person before board members.",
      "The inmate\u2019s file is then sent to the parole board and voted on by a three-person panel. The panel will vote on a case just prior to the inmate\u2019s parole eligibility date and a majority of two votes is needed for a final decision.",
      "In Texas, the board does not conduct public parole hearings. Parole release decisions are made independently by each panel member.",
      "Representatives for members of Quintanilla-P\u00e9rez\u2019s family did not immediately respond to The Associated Press' request for comment this week.",
      "A denial by the panel will include the date of the next time an inmate will be eligible for parole.",
      "Sald\u00edvar was convicted of first-degree murder, one of the crimes where state law dictates that the next review after a denial can be done anywhere from one to five years from the date of the denial.",
      "An approval by the panel could include special conditions the inmate will have to follow while on parole. Processing time for a release differs from case to case. Once a release certificate with an approved residence plan is issued, it will be audited by the Texas Department of Criminal Justice\u2019s Classification and Records Department and a release date is calculated. Typically, these processes can take two to six weeks to complete.",
      "The governor cannot veto a parole decision by the pardons board. The governor, upon recommendation by a majority of the pardons board, can grant clemency. That includes pardons, commutations and reprieves.",

      "A woman accusing French actor G\u00e9rard Depardieu of sexual assault has told a landmark trial in Paris that he groped her buttocks and her breasts several times in three separate incidents on a film set",
      "PARIS -- A woman accusing French actor G\u00e9rard Depardieu of sexual assault told a landmark trial in Paris on Wednesday that he groped her buttocks and her breasts several times in three separate incidents on a film set.",
      "Depardieu, 76, is accused of groping a 54-year-old set dresser and a 34-year-old assistant during filming in 2021 of \u201cLes Volets Verts\u201d (\u201cThe Green Shutters\u201d). He denies any sexual assault.",
      "Day 3 of the Paris trial focused on the testimony of the younger plaintiff, who said Depardieu first groped her bottom when she was alone with him for a brief moment between the backstage area and the film set.",
      "\u201cOut of the blue, he put his hand on my butt,\u201d she said, adding she was \u201cunder shock,\u201d \u201cpetrified,\u201d and said nothing.",

      "The plaintiff said she reported the issue to her direct manager, who then alerted others in charge of the film production, prompting anger from the actor.",
      "Depardieu repeatedly denied the allegations Wednesday in court, saying : \u201cI\u2019m not like that.\u201d",
      "\u201cI think that maybe, I don\u2019t know, she was wary because of my reputation of being vulgar, crude, rude,\" Depardieu said. \"But I\u2019m not only that. I still respect people.\u201d",
      "The actor also told the court that he is almost always accompanied by aides on the film set, including his body guard, and suggested that he would rarely find himself alone with a film worker.",
      "On Tuesday, Depardieu acknowledged that he had used vulgar and sexualized language with the set dresser who accused him of sexual assault. He said he grabbed her hips during an argument, but denied that his behavior was sexual.",

      "Mexico says a government-sponsored junk food ban in schools has taken effect as the country tries to tackle one of the world\u2019s worst obesity and diabetes epidemics",
      "MEXICO CITY -- A government-sponsored junk food ban in schools across Mexico took effect on Saturday, officials said, as the country tries to tackle one of the world\u2019s worst obesity and diabetes epidemics.",
      "The health guidelines, first published last fall, take a direct shot at salty and sweet processed products that have become a staple for generations of Mexican schoolchildren, such as sugary fruit drinks, packaged chips, artificial pork rinds and soy-encased, chili-flavored peanuts.",
      "Announcing that the ban had become law, Mexico's Education Ministry posted on X: \u201cFarewell, junk food!\u201d It encouraged parents to support the government's crusade by cooking healthy meals for their kids.",
      "\u201cOne of the core principles of the new Mexican school system is healthy living,\" said Mario Delgado, the public health secretary. \u201cThere's a high level of acceptance of this policy among parents.\u201d",
      "Mexico's ambitious attempt to remake its food culture and reprogram the next generation of consumers is being watched closely around the world as governments struggle to turn the tide on a global obesity epidemic.",
      "In the United States, for instance, the Trump administration\u2019s health secretary, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., has vowed to upend the nation's food system and \u201c Make America Healthy Again \" by targeting ultra-processed foods to curb surging obesity and disease.",
      "Under Mexico's new order, schools must phase out any food and beverage displaying even one black warning logo marking it as high in salt, sugar, calories and fat. Mexico implemented that compulsory front-of-package labeling system in 2020.",
      "Enforced from Monday morning, the start of the school week, the junk food ban also requires schools to serve more nutritious alternatives to junk food, like bean tacos, and offer plain drinking water.",
      "\u201cIt is much better to eat a bean taco than a bag of potato chips,\u201d said Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum, who has championed the ban.",
      "Mexico\u2019s children consume more junk food than anywhere else in Latin America, according to UNICEF, which classifies the nation\u2019s childhood obesity epidemic as an emergency. Sugary drinks and highly processed foods account for 40% of the total calories that children consume in a day, the agency reports.",
      "\u201cAt my daughter's school, they told us that future activities wouldn't have candy, it would be completely different, with fruit, vegetables and other food that's healthy for kids,\u201d said Aurora Mart\u00ednez, a mother of two. \u201cIt will help us a lot.\u201d",
      "One-third of Mexican children are already considered overweight or obese, according to government statistics.",
      "School administrators found in violation of the order face stiff fines, ranging from $545 to $5,450.",
      "But enforcement poses a challenge in a country where previous junk food bans have struggled to gain traction and monitoring has been lax across Mexico\u2019s 255,000 schools, many of which lack water fountains \u2014 even reliable internet and electricity.",
      "It also wasn't immediately clear how the government would forbid the sale of junk food on sidewalks outside school campuses, where street vendors typically hawk candy, chips, nachos and ice cream to kids during recess and after the school day ends.",
      "\u201cIt will be difficult,\u201d said Abril Geraldine Rose de Le\u00f3n, a child therapist. \u201cBut it will be achieved in the long run.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "A groundbreaking initiative could soon be bringing surgeons closer to patients in Africa's remote corners where the doctor-to-patients ratio is among the lowest in the world",
      "KOFORIDUA, Ghana -- Charles Owusu Aseku has traveled across Ghana and beyond in search of care for the large growth of tissue called a keloid on his neck since 2002. The 46-year-old was growing increasingly frustrated after two unsuccessful surgeries and a trip to South Africa that ended with just a consultation.",
      "Aseku was preparing for yet another medical trip until late February when he joined others in the first trial of 3D telemedicine technology in Ghana powered through computer screens in the back of a van.",
      "Those behind the initiative, developed by Microsoft\u2019s research team in partnership with local doctors and researchers, say the remote assessment will help provide medical consultations for patients awaiting surgery or after an operation, in a region where the doctor-to-patient ratio is among the lowest in the world.",
      "The project builds on earlier trials in Scotland and now works as a portable system with enhanced lighting and camera upgrades.",
      "Once inside the van, cameras will capture a 3D model of each patient and the image is then projected onto a large computer screen. Multiple doctors can join the consultation session online and manipulate the 3D model to assess the patient.",
      "\u201cThe idea behind the van is to allow it to travel to those remote villages that don\u2019t have specialized care ... to perform a pre or post-surgical consult,\u201d said Spencer Fowers, principal software developer and 3D-telemedicine project lead at Microsoft Research.",
      "The initiative also gives patients the opportunity to have multiple opinions. Aseku\u2019s session had doctors from Rwanda, Scotland and Brazil, an experience that he said gave him hope.",
      "\"I see a lot of doctors here and I am very happy because experience will come from each of them and maybe they will find a solution to my problem,\u201d the 46-year-old said.",
      "Researchers hope the trial at the Koforidua Regional Hospital, in Ghana\u2019s eastern region, is the start of a wider project that could expand the service and explore new use cases.",
      "Recent years have seen growing use of telemedicine, especially since the COVID-19 pandemic. Experts say such digital tools can benefit patients in Africa the most because there are so few specialist doctors for the continent's 1.4 billion people.",
      "George Opoku, 68, was referred to the Korle-Bu Teaching Hospital in the capital Accra \u2014 nearly 100 kilometers away from the Koforidua hospital, which is much closer to his home \u2014 where he had first gone to seek care for sarcoma, a rare form of cancer that develops in the bones and soft tissues.",
      "Upon hearing about the 3D telemedicine trial, his doctor decided to register him for the process, saving him the extra expenses and stress of long-distance travel.",
      "\u201cThis time I had to sit in a van and to introduce myself and condition to not only one doctor but several of them. I was able to answer all their questions and I am hopeful that they will discuss and cure me of my condition,\u201d Opku said. \u201cI feel well already and I am hopeful.\"",
      "A key challenge for the project is the lack of stable internet access, a common problem in remote parts of Africa.",
      "At the Korle-Bu Teaching Hospital, the technology is helping patients in need of plastic surgery. An inadequate number of plastic surgeons means that patients often have to consult with different doctors during each visit.",
      "Dr. Kwame Darko, consultant plastic surgeon at the hospital and one of the principal investigators on the project, said that 3D telemedicine could give patients the chance to be seen by multiple doctors during one session.",
      "The 3D technology could make a difference if replicated in Ghana and elsewhere, according to Dr. Ahensan Dasebre, chief resident doctor at the National Reconstructive Plastic Surgery and Burns Centre at Korle-Bu, who was not part of the project.",
      "\u201cWe are already behind in terms of how many doctors are available to care for a certain number of the population,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cIf somebody is in a remote part of town where he doesn\u2019t have access to these specialized services, but needs it, the referring doctor could actually use this telemedicine thing to get access to the best of care.\u201d",

Capital cases are rare in the country of 9 million people, but executions typically come swiftly after defendants have their appeals exhausted.

      "MOSCOW -- Russia's Supreme Court on Monday said it received a petition from the prosecutor general's office to lift the ban on Afghanistan's Taliban, who were outlawed two decades ago as a terrorist group.",
      "The court said in a statement that it would hold a hearing on the petition, submitted by Prosecutor General Igor Krasnov, on April 17. Russia last year adopted a law stipulating that the official terrorist designation of an organization could be suspended by a court.",
      "The Taliban were put on Russia\u2019s list of terrorist organizations in 2003. Any contact with such groups is punishable under Russian law.",
      "At the same time, Taliban delegations have attended various forums hosted by Moscow. Russian officials have shrugged off questions about the seeming contradiction by emphasizing the need to engage the Taliban to help stabilize Afghanistan.",
      "The former Soviet Union fought a 10-year war in Afghanistan that ended with Moscow withdrawing its troops in 1989. Since then, Moscow has made a diplomatic comeback as a power broker, hosting talks on Afghanistan involving senior representatives of the Taliban and neighboring nations.",
      "There is a deepening divide in the international community on how to deal with the Taliban, who have been in power for three years and face no real opposition. Afghanistan\u2019s rulers have pursued bilateral ties with major regional powers.",

      "A French court has convicted Marine Le Pen of embezzlement and barred her from seeking public office for five years",
      "PARIS -- A French court on Monday convicted Marine Le Pen of embezzlement and barred her from seeking public office for five years \u2014 a hammer blow to the far-right leader\u2019s presidential hopes and an earthquake for French politics.",
      "Le Pen's lawyer said she would appeal the verdict, but she will remain ineligible while she does and so could be ruled out of the 2027 presidential race. She was also sentenced to four years' imprisonment, with two to be served under house arrest and two suspended.",
      "The court ruling was a political as well as a judicial temblor for France, hobbling one of the leading contenders to succeed President Emmanuel Macron at the end of his second and final term. So broad were the political implications that even some of Le Pen's opponents said the Paris court had gone too far.",
      "But it\u2019s too early to say how the case will affect voters. The potential elimination of Le Pen could fire up diehard supporters, just as U.S. President\u2019s Donald Trump\u2019s legal problems motivated some of his. But it could also leave her on the sidelines, deflating what had been her upward trajectory.",
      "Le Pen herself was not around to hear the chief judge pronounce the sentence that threw her career into a tailspin. By then, she had already strode out of the courtroom after the judge first indicated that the 56-year-old would be barred from office, without saying straight away for how long.",
      "Although Le Pen did not immediately comment, her supporters quickly expressed disapproval. Jordan Bardella, her 29-year-old prot\u00e9g\u00e9 who could replace her on the ballot in 2027 if she cannot run, said on X that Le Pen was \u201cbeing unjustly condemned\u201d and that French democracy was \u201cbeing executed.\u201d",
      "Hungary\u2019s populist prime minister, Viktor Orb\u00e1n, quickly took to social media to express his support, posting \u201cJe suis Marine!\u201d \u2014 I am Marine \u2014 on X.",
      "Among political opponents of Le Pen who expressed unease was conservative lawmaker Laurent Wauquiez, who said the verdict put \u201ca very heavy weight on our democracy.\u201d",
      "The sentence could prevent Le Pen from making what would have been her fourth run for the presidency in 2027, a scenario she has previously described as a \u201cpolitical death.\u201d The party\u2019s most recognized figurehead and a formidable campaigner, Le Pen was runner-up to Macron in the 2017 and 2022 presidential elections, and her party\u2019s electoral support has grown in recent years.",
      "Only an appellate ruling that overturns the ban on public office could restore her hopes of running. But with the election just two years away, time is running out. There\u2019s no guarantee that an appeals court would rule more favorably, and appeals in France can take several years to conclude.",
      "The verdict was a resounding defeat for Le Pen's National Rally party, formerly the National Front.",
      "She and 24 other party officials were accused of having used money intended for European Union parliamentary aides to instead pay staff who worked for the party between 2004 and 2016, violating the 27-nation bloc\u2019s regulations.",
      "The judge handed down guilty verdicts to eight other current or former members of her party who, like Le Pen, previously served as European Parliament lawmakers. Also convicted were 12 people who served as parliamentary aides and three others. Only one defendant was acquitted. All had denied wrongdoing.",
      "The chief judge said Le Pen had been at the heart of \u201ca system\u201d that her party used to siphon off EU parliament funds, though she said they didn't enrich themselves personally. The ruling described the embezzlement as \u201ca democratic bypass\" that deceived the parliament and voters.",
      "From the front row of the court, Le Pen showed no immediate reaction when the judge first declared her guilty. But she grew more agitated as the verdict was delivered in greater detail. She shook her head in disagreement as the judge said Le Pen\u2019s party illegally used European funds for its own benefit.",
      "\u201cIncredible,\u201d she whispered at one point. She then left without warning, picking up her bag and striding out, her heels clicking on the hardwood floor. The abrupt departure left many in the courtroom in disbelief as they turned their heads toward the door.",
      "Rodolphe Bosselut, Le Pen's lawyer, said he was \u201cappalled\u201d at the court\u2019s decision, which he described as \u201cextremely scandalous\u201d and said it would be appealed.",
      "The electoral ineligibility takes effect immediately, but the house arrest is suspended while she appeals.",
      "During the nine-week trial that took place in late 2024, Le Pen argued that ineligibility \u201cwould have the effect of depriving me of being a presidential candidate\" and disenfranchise her supporters.",
      "\u201cThere are 11 million people who voted for the movement I represent. So tomorrow, potentially, millions and millions of French people would see themselves deprived of their candidate in the election,\u201d she told the panel of three judges.",
      "Le Pen also serves as a lawmaker in France's National Assembly, a role not affected by the ineligibility ruling that she can keep for now.",
      "But if Macron dissolves parliament again, as he did last year, and calls early legislative elections, she would be barred from running.",

      "South Korean police plan to question a 56-year-old man on suspicion of starting at least one of the wildfires that recently devastated the country\u2019s southern regions, killing 30 people and burning more than 119,000 acres of land",
      "SEOUL, South Korea -- South Korean police plan to question a 56-year-old man on suspicion of starting at least one of the wildfires that recently devastated the country\u2019s southern regions, killing 30 people and burning more than 119,000 acres of land.",
      "The North Gyeongsang provincial police department said the unidentified man may have used fire while clearing overgrown grass at a family grave on a hill in the southeastern town of Uiseong, one of the areas hardest hit by the wildfires.",
      "Police investigators examined the grave site on Monday morning and plan to question the man soon. The police department did not immediately say whether others would also be questioned over suspected links to the wildfires, which fire officials believe may have been sparked by multiple human errors, also including burning trash and sparks from welding work.",
      "Fueled by dry and windy conditions, the wildfires raged for a week, destroying thousands of homes, and leaving mountains covered in ash, before firefighters, aided by rain, brought them under control on Friday.",
      "The 30 people killed were mostly in their 60s or older. They include a pilot whose helicopter crashed during firefighting efforts and four firefighters and other workers who died earlier after being trapped by fast-moving flames. At least 45 people were injured, including nine seriously.",
      "The fires damaged or destroyed more than 6,000 structures, including over 1,000 homes each in the southeastern city of Andong and the nearby coastal town of Yeongdeok, as well as more than 330 homes in Uiseong.",
      "The fires in Uiseong damaged about 20 of the 30 structures at the Gounsa temple complex, said to have been originally built in the 7th century. Among them were two state-designated \u201ctreasures\u201d: a pavilion overlooking a stream that dates to 1668, and a Joseon dynasty structure built in 1904 to mark the longevity of a king.",

      "Government spokesman Maj. Gen. Zaw Min Tun told state-run MRTV that another 3,400 have been injured and more than 300 were missing. The military had previously reported 1,644 dead but did not provide specific figures in its update.",
      "The 7.7 magnitude earthquake hit at midday Friday, causing widespread damage, including in the capital Naypitaw and the second largest city, Mandalay.",
      "It was the time of Friday prayers for the country's Muslim minority during the holy month of Ramadan, and some 700 worshippers were killed when mosques collapsed, said Tun Kyi, a member of the steering committee of the Spring Revolution Myanmar Muslim Network. It was not clear whether they were already included in the official count of casualties.",
      "Tun Kyi said some 60 mosques were damaged or destroyed when the earthquake struck, and videos posted on The Irrawaddy online news site showed several mosques toppling during the quake, and people fleeing from the areas.",
      "The true number of people killed and injured across the regions hit is thought to be possibly many times the official figures, but with telecommunication outages and extreme challenges to movement around the country, little is known about the damage in many areas.",
      "\u201cWe're really not clear on the scale of the destruction at this stage,\u201d Lauren Ellery, deputy director of programs in Myanmar for the International Rescue Committee, told The Associated Press.",
      "There is a state of emergency in six regions, and Ellery said her teams on the ground and their local partners are currently assessing where needs are the greatest, while providing emergency medical care, humanitarian supplies and other assistance.",
      "\u201cThey were talking about a town near Mandalay where 80% of the buildings were reportedly collapsed, but it wasn't in the news because telecommunications have been slow,\u201d she said.",
      "\u201cEven in areas where there isn't so much impact, our partner reported to us on Saturday that there were landslides stopping them reaching one of the villages.\u201d",
      "The earthquake, centered near Mandalay \u2014 a city of some 1.5 million, brought down buildings and damaged other infrastructure like the city\u2019s airport.",
      "A lack of heavy machinery has slowed search and rescue operations, forcing many to slowly search for survivors by hand in the relentless heat, with daily temperatures above 40 degrees Celsius (104 Fahrenheit).",
      "The earthquake also shock neighboring Thailand and killed at least 18 people, many at a construction site in Bangkok where a partially built high-rise collapsed.",
      "Another 33 have been reported injured and 78 missing, primarily at the construction site near the popular Chatuchak market.",
      "Heavy equipment was shut down and authorities urged onlookers to be silent as they used machines to try and detect any signs of life from under the rubble.",
      "Bangkok Governor Chadchart Sittipunt told reporters at the scene that signs had been detected Sunday night, though experts could not determine whether it had been machine error.",
      "Nonetheless, he said he still had hope survivors would be found.",

      "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- Suspected U.S. airstrikes struck around Yemen's rebel-held capital overnight into Monday morning, and the Iranian-backed Houthis said at least one person was killed.",
      "The full extent of the damage and possible casualties wasn\u2019t immediately clear. The attacks followed a night of airstrikes early Friday that appeared particularly intense compared to other days in the campaign that began March 15.",
      "The strikes around Sanaa, Yemen's capital held by the Houthis since 2014, also wounded four others, the rebels said. Their al-Masirah satellite news channel aired footage of broken glass littering homes after the concussive blast of the bombs, but continued not to show the targets of the attacks \u2014 suggesting the sites had a military or intelligence function.",
      "An Associated Press review has found the new American operation against the Houthis under President Donald Trump appears more extensive than those under former President Joe Biden, as the U.S. moves from solely targeting launch sites to firing at ranking personnel as well as dropping bombs in cities.",
      "The new campaign of airstrikes, which the Houthis now say have killed at least 59 people, started after the rebels threatened to begin targeting \u201cIsraeli\u201d ships again over Israel blocking aid entering the Gaza Strip. The rebels in the past loosely defined what constitutes an Israeli ship, meaning other vessels could be targeted.",
      "The Houthis had targeted over 100 merchant vessels with missiles and drones, sinking two vessels and killing four sailors from November 2023 until January of this year. They also launched attacks targeting American warships, though none has been hit so far.",
      "The attacks greatly raised the Houthis\u2019 profile as they faced economic problems and launched a crackdown targeting any dissent and aid workers at home amid Yemen\u2019s decadelong stalemated war that has torn apart the Arab world\u2019s poorest nation.",

      "\u201cMany have resorted to just finding a way to eat on that festivity, but the spirit is low,\u201d she said.",
      "In India, Muslims are marking the celebration of Eid with special prayers, family gatherings and festive meals.",
      "The holiday comes as the minority community faces vilification by hardline Hindu nationalists. Muslim groups are also protesting against a proposal by Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s government to change laws governing Muslim land endowments.",
      "The government says it wants to weed out corruption and mismanagement in hundreds of thousands of Muslim land endowments. But Muslim groups say the proposal pending approval in India\u2019s parliament is discriminatory.",

      "LONDON -- The chairperson of an African charity co-founded by Prince Harry accused the royal on Sunday of orchestrating a bullying and harassment campaign to try to force her out as she pushed back following his abrupt resignation from the organization.",
      "Sophie Chandauka, the Sentebale chair, took several shots at Harry on Sky News in which she described how the prince\u2019s Netflix deal interfered with a scheduled fundraiser and how an incident with his wife, Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, became a source of friction.",
      "The Duke of Sussex cited a breakdown in the relationship between board members and Chandauka when he resigned Tuesday as a patron of the charity he co-founded nearly 20 years ago in memory of his late mother, Princess Diana.",
      "Harry and co-founder Prince Seeiso of Lesotho said in a joint statement that they quit \u201cwith heavy hearts\u201d as patrons in support of the trustees in their dispute with Chandauka.",
      "\u201cIt is devastating that the relationship between the charity\u2019s trustees and the chair of the board broke down beyond repair, creating an untenable situation,\u201d the princes said. \u201cIn turn, she sued the charity to remain in this voluntary position, further underscoring the broken relationship.\u201d",
      "Chandauka said she reported Sentebale\u2019s trustees to the Charity Commission in the U.K. and filed papers in a British court to prevent her removal.",
      "She alleged there was misconduct at the charity without naming anyone or offering any details in a statement Tuesday. It said she had tried to blow the whistle on \u201cabuse of power, bullying, harassment, misogyny and misogynoir,\u201d the latter word referring to a combination of racism and misogyny directed toward Black women.",
      "Chandauka told Sky that Harry\u2019s resignation had caught her blindsided and was \u201can example of harassment and bullying at scale.\u201d She said he also had interfered with her whistleblower complaint.",
      "\u201cSo it\u2019s a cover-up, and the prince is involved,\" she said.",

      "The charity, whose name means \u201cdon\u2019t forget me\u201d in the Sesotho language of Lesotho and South Africa, was founded to help youths affected by AIDS in the small mountainous nation and in Botswana. But it is now moving to address youth health, wealth and climate resilience in southern Africa.",
      "The biggest risk to the charity was the \u201ctoxicity of its lead patron\u2019s brand,\" Chandauka told the Financial Times.",
      "In the Sky interview, she said that a polo fundraiser scheduled in Miami last year almost fell apart when Harry asked to bring a camera crew along that was filming him for a Netflix series on the sport.",
      "The cost of the venue skyrocketed when it became a commercial venture and they scrambled to find another host, which Harry arranged through his connections, she said.",
      "Meghan's surprise appearance at the event led to an awkward moment during the trophy presentation after the match, Chandauka said.",
      "In a video clip circulated on social media, Chandauka tried to pose next to the duke as he held the trophy in one hand and had his other wrapped around Meghan. But the duchess appeared to gesture that Chandauka move farther from Harry, forcing her to duck under the silver cup to get into the photo.",
      "\u201cThe international press captured this, and there was a lot of talk about the duchess and the choreography on stage and whether she should have been there and her treatment of me,\" Chandauka said.",
      "She said she rejected Harry's request that she issue a statement in support of Meghan, because \"we cannot be an extension of the Sussexes.\u201d",
      "Sky News said it contacted Harry and Meghan and they declined to offer a formal response. An emailed request by The Associated Press seeking comment from their spokespeople was not immediately returned.",

      "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- Iran\u2019s president said Sunday that Tehran had rejected direct negotiations with the United States in response to a letter from President Donald Trump over its rapidly advancing nuclear program.",
      "The remarks from President Masoud Pezeshkian represented the first official acknowledgment of how Iran responded to Trump\u2019s letter. It also suggests that tensions may further rise between Tehran and Washington.",
      "Pezeshkian said: \u201cAlthough the possibility of direct negotiations between the two sides has been rejected in this response, it has been emphasized that the path for indirect negotiations remains open.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s unclear, however, whether Trump would accept indirect negotiations. Indirect negotiations for years since Trump initially withdrew America from Tehran\u2019s nuclear deal with world powers in 2018 have been unsuccessful.",
      "Trump\u2019s overture comes as both Israel and the United States have warned they will never let Iran acquire a nuclear weapon, leading to fears of a military confrontation as Tehran enriches uranium at near weapons-grade levels \u2014 something only done by atomic-armed nations.",
      "Iran has long maintained its program is for peaceful purposes, even as its officials increasingly threaten to pursue the bomb as tensions are high with the U.S. over its sanctions and after the collapse of a ceasefire in Israel's war against Hamas in the Gaza Strip.",
      "Since Trump returned to the White House, his administration has consistently said that Iran must be prevented from acquiring nuclear weapons. A report in February, however, by the U.N.\u2019s nuclear watchdog said Iran has accelerated its production of near weapons-grade uranium.",
      "Trump\u2019s first term in office was marked by a particularly troubled period in relations with Tehran. In 2018, he unilaterally withdrew the United States from Iran\u2019s nuclear deal with world powers, leading to sanctions hobbling Iran\u2019s economy. Iran retaliated with attacks at sea \u2014 including one that it likely carried out and that temporarily halved Saudi Arabia\u2019s oil production.",
      "Trump also ordered the attack that killed Iran\u2019s top general in a Baghdad drone strike in January 2020.",

      "The utility announced that its board picked Moul as president and chief executive to replace Jeff Lyash, who said in January that he would retire no later than September. The move comes less than a week after Trump removed one of the utility's board members without indicating why. With the firing of Michelle Moore, an appointee of former President Joe Biden, the board currently has five members and four vacancies.",
      "The board firing and CEO hiring come after Tennessee's two Republican U.S. senators urged officials to opt for \u201can interim CEO trusted by the president\u201d before hiring someone long-term.",
      "Moul has served as TVA's executive vice president and chief operating officer since June 2021. In a news release announcing his selection, TVA focused in part on Moul's leadership in the advancement of nuclear energy technologies and his experience as a licensed senior reactor operator. He starts in the new role on April 9.",
      "\u201cTVA needs a steady hand right now,\" Moul said in the news release. \"I will build on the momentum that Jeff and our team have created -\u2013 making sure we continue to invest in new generation, strengthen our grid and enhance system reliability.\u201d",
      "Earlier this month, U.S. Sens. Marsha Blackburn and Bill Hagerty wrote a guest column arguing that the TVA board was bogging down a project that seeks to build a small modular reactor with studies and hurdles.",
      "Blackburn and Hagerty also said that hiring a CEO from within would forgo the chance to recruit a \u201ctop-quality leader\u201d from outside the utility, which provides power to 10 million people across seven Southern states.",
      "In part, advocates for nuclear energy have called for its expansion to help meet the demand from companies to power their artificial intelligence technologies, and do so without carbon emissions that speed up climate change.",
      "Stephen Smith, executive director of the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy, called the op-ed by Blackburn and Hagerty \u201creckless interference.\u201d He said they don't understand the \u201crisk of rushing nuclear technology before it\u2019s ready for prime time both economically and safety-wise.\u201d",
      "Clean energy advocates have also criticized TVA's decision to replace several of its aging coal plants with another fossil fuel, natural gas.",
      "Trump put TVA and the outgoing CEO Lyash on the hot seat in his first term.",
      "In 2020, Trump fired the former TVA board chairman and another board member and drove TVA to reverse course on the hiring of foreign labor for information technology jobs.",
      "He also called for Lyash\u2019s replacement and the position\u2019s pay to be capped at $500,000.",
      "In response, TVA has noted that the CEO pay ranks in the bottom quartile of the power industry. Lyash\u2019s total compensation topped $10.5 million in the 2024 budget year, including various pension and performance incentives worth millions of dollars. Additionally, the utility has stressed that it doesn\u2019t receive federal taxpayer money and instead is funded by electricity customers.",
      "A TVA spokesperson has said Lyash's retirement was not related to the administration or current politics and that Lyash had begun talking to TVA board members last fall about considering retirement.",

    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump is taking a blowtorch to the rules that have governed world trade for decades",
      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump is taking a blowtorch to the rules that have governed world trade for decades. The \u201creciprocal\u2019\u2019 tariffs that he is expected to announce Wednesday are likely to create chaos for global businesses and conflict with America\u2019s allies and adversaries alike.",
      "Since the 1960s, tariffs \u2014 or import taxes \u2014 have emerged from negotiations between dozens of countries. Trump wants to seize the process.",
      "\u201cObviously, it disrupts the way that things have been done for a very long time,\u2019\u2019 said Richard Mojica, a trade attorney at Miller & Chevalier. \u201cTrump is throwing that out the window ... Clearly this is ripping up trade. There are going to have to be adjustments all over the place.\u2019\u2019",
      "Pointing to America\u2019s massive and persistent trade deficits \u2013 not since 1975 has the U.S. sold the rest of the world more than it\u2019s bought -- Trump charges that the playing field is tilted against U.S. companies. A big reason for that, he and his advisers say, is because other countries usually tax American exports at a higher rate than America taxes theirs.",
      "Trump has a fix: He\u2019s raising U.S. tariffs to match what other countries charge.",
      "And he's expected to roll out his reciprocal tariffs \u2014 possibly along with unknown details about other import taxes \u2014 on Wednesday April 2. He's taken to calling the date \"Liberation Day'' because his protectionist policies aim to free the U.S. economy from dependence on foreign goods.",
      "The president is an unabashed tariff supporter. He used them liberally in his first term and is deploying them even more aggressively in his second. Since returning to the White House, he has slapped 20% tariffs on China, unveiled a 25% tax on imported cars and trucks set to take effect Thursday, effectively raised U.S. taxes on foreign steel and aluminum and imposed levies on some goods from Canada and Mexico, which he may expand this week.",
      "Economists don't share Trump's enthusiasm for tariffs. They're a tax on importers that usually get passed on to consumers. But it's possible that Trump's reciprocal tariff threat could bring other countries to the table and get them to lower their own import taxes.",
      "\u201cIt could be win-win,\u201d said Christine McDaniel, a former U.S. trade official now at George Mason University\u2019s Mercatus Center. \u201cIt\u2019s in other countries\u2019 interests to reduce those tariffs.\u201d",
      "She noted that India has already cut tariffs on items from motorcycles to luxury cars and agreed to ramp up purchases of U.S. energy.",
      "They sound simple: The United States would raise its tariff on foreign goods to match what other countries impose on U.S. products.",
      "\u201cIf they charge us, we charge them,\u2019\u2019 the president said in February. \u201cIf they\u2019re at 25, we\u2019re at 25. If they\u2019re at 10, we\u2019re at 10. And if they\u2019re much higher than 25, that\u2019s what we are too.\u2019\u2019",
      "But the White House didn\u2019t reveal many details. It has directed Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick to deliver a report this week about how the new tariffs would actually work.",
      "Among the outstanding questions, noted Antonio Rivera, a partner at ArentFox Schiff and a former attorney with U.S. Customs and Border Protection, is whether the U.S. is going to look at the thousands of items in the tariff code \u2013 from motorcycles to mangos -- and try to level the tariff rates out one by one, country by country. Or whether it will look more broadly at each country\u2019s average tariff and how it compares to America. Or something else entirely.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s just a very, very chaotic environment,\u201d said Stephen Lamar, president and CEO of the American Apparel & Footwear Association. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to plan in any sort of long-term, sustainable way.\u2019\u2019",
      "America\u2019s tariffs are generally lower than those of its trading partners. After World War II, the United States pushed for other countries to lower trade barriers and tariffs, seeing free trade as a way to promote peace, prosperity and American exports around the world. And it mostly practiced what it preached, generally keeping its own tariffs low and giving American consumers access to inexpensive foreign goods.",
      "Trump has broken with the old free trade consensus, saying unfair foreign competition has hurt American manufacturers and devastated factory towns in the American heartland. During his first term, he slapped tariffs on foreign steel, aluminum, washing machines, solar panels and almost everything from China. Democratic President Joe Biden largely continued Trump\u2019s protectionist policies.",
      "The White House has cited several examples of especially lopsided tariffs: Brazil taxes ethanol imports, including America\u2019s, at 18%, but the U.S. tariff on ethanol is just 2.5%. Likewise, India taxes foreign motorcycles at 100%, America just 2.4%.",
      "The higher foreign tariffs that Trump complains about weren\u2019t sneakily adopted by foreign countries. The United States agreed to them after years of complex negotiations known as the Uruguay Round, which ended in a trade pact involving 123 countries.",
      "As part of the deal, the countries could set their own tariffs on different products \u2013 but under the \u201cmost favored nation\u2019\u2019 approach, they couldn\u2019t charge one country more than they charged another. So the high tariffs Trump complains about aren\u2019t aimed at the United States alone. They hit everybody.",
      "Trump\u2019s grievances against U.S. trading partners also come at an odd time. The United States, running on strong consumer spending and healthy improvements in productivity, is outperforming the world\u2019s other advanced economies. The U.S. economy grew nearly 9% from just before COVID-19 hit through the middle of last year \u2014 compared with just 5.5% for Canada and just 1.9% for the European Union. Germany's economy shrank 2% during that time.",
      "Not satisfied with scrambling the tariff code, Trump is also going after other foreign practices he sees as unfair barriers to American exports. These include subsidies that give homegrown producers an advantage over U.S. exports; ostensible health rules that are used to keep out foreign products; and loose regulations that encourage the theft of trade secrets and other intellectual property.",
      "Figuring out an import tax that offsets the damage from those practices will add another level of complexity to Trump\u2019s reciprocal tariff scheme.",
      "The Trump team is also picking a fight with the European Union and other trading partners over so-called value-added taxes. Known as VATs, these levies are essentially a sales tax on products that are consumed within a country\u2019s borders. Trump and his advisers consider VATs a tariff because they apply to U.S. exports.",
      "Yet most economists disagree, for a simple reason: VATs are applied to domestic and imported products alike, so they don't specifically target foreign goods and haven't traditionally been seen as a trade barrier.",
      "And there\u2019s a bigger problem: VATs are huge revenue raisers for European governments. \u201cThere is no way most countries can negotiate over their VAT ... as it is a critical part of their revenue base,\u2019\u2019 Brad Setser, senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, posted on X.",
      "Paul Ashworth, chief North America economist for Capital Economics, says that the top 15 countries that export to the U.S. have average VATs topping 14%, as well as duties of 6%. That would mean U.S. retaliatory tariffs could reach 20% \u2014 much higher than Trump's campaign proposal of universal 10% duties.",
      "Trump and some of his advisers argue that steeper tariffs would help reverse the United States' long-standing trade deficits.",
      "But tariffs haven't proven successful at narrowing the trade gap: Despite the Trump-Biden import taxes, the deficit rose last year to $918 billion, second-highest on record.",
      "The deficit, economists say, is a result of the unique features of the U.S. economy. Because the federal government runs a huge deficit, and American consumers like to spend so much, U.S. consumption and investment far outpaces savings. As a result, a chunk of that demand goes to overseas goods and services.",
      "The U.S. covers the cost of the trade gap by essentially borrowing from overseas, in part by selling treasury securities and other assets.",
      "\u201cThe trade deficit is really a macroeconomic imbalance,\" said Kimberly Clausing, a UCLA economist and former Treasury official. \u201cIt comes from this lack of desire to save and this lack of desire to tax. Until you fix those things, we\u2019ll run a trade imbalance.\u201d",

      "But in the longer run it's important to ensure building safety in the city, which has millions of people living and working in thousands of high-rise buildings. The magnitude 7.7 quake centered more than 800 miles (1,200 kilometers) away killed more than 1,700 people in Myanmar and at least 18 in Thailand, most at the Bangkok construction site near the popular Chatuchak Market.",

      "Although it does not sit near a geologic fault, Bangkok is built on relatively unstable alluvial soil, on the banks of the Chao Phraya River. The city has long been sinking under the weight of its many tall buildings, leading authorities to restrict the use of groundwater to help reduce subsidence.",
      "The Myanmar quake Friday gave the city an unusually long and strong jolt, causing water from rooftop pools to cascade down skyscrapers, light-rail trains to rock on their tracks, and millions of people to flee homes and apartment buildings. Many people waited for hours to see if their homes and offices were safe.",
      "Most other damage in the city appeared to be superficial, such as fallen ceiling panels and fittings and cracked plaster.",

      "There is plenty of nostalgia at Black Mountain, New Hampshire's oldest ski area",
      "JACKSON, N.H. -- A skier since age 4, Thomas Brennick now enjoys regular trips to New Hampshire\u2019s Black Mountain with his two grandchildren.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s back to the old days,\u201d he said from the Summit Double chairlift on a recent sunny Friday. \u201cIt's just good, old-time skiing at its best.\u201d",
      "Behind the scenes, the experience is now propelled by a high-tech system designed to increase efficiency at the state\u2019s oldest ski area. And while small, independent resorts can\u2019t compete on infrastructure or buying power with conglomerates like Vail, which owns nearby Attitash Mountain Resort and seven others in the Northeast alone, at least one entrepreneur is betting technology will be \u201ca really great equalizer.\u201d",
      "That businessman is Erik Mogensen, who bought Black Mountain last year and turned it into a lab for his ski mountain consultancy, Entabeni Systems. The company builds systems that put lift tickets sales, lesson reservations and equipment rentals online while collecting detailed data to inform decisions such as where to make more snow and how much.",
      "\u201cA lot of general managers will go out and look at how many rows of cars are parked, and that\u2019s kind of how they tell how busy they are,\u201d Mogensen said. \u201cWe really want to look at that transactional data down to the deepest level.\u201d",
      "That includes analyzing everything from the most popular time to sell hot dogs in the lodge to how many runs a season pass holder makes per visit.",
      "\u201cThe large operators, they can do a lot of things at scale that we can\u2019t. They can buy 20 snow cats at a time, 10 chairlifts, those types of things. We can\u2019t do that, but we\u2019re really nimble,\u201d Mogensen said. \u201cWe can decide to change the way we groom very quickly, or change the way we open trails, or change our (food and beverage) menu in the middle of a day.\u201d",
      "Mogensen, who says his happiest moments are tied to skiing, started Entabeni Systems in 2015, driven by the desire to keep the sport accessible. In 2023, he bought the company Indy Pass, which allows buyers to ski for two days each at 230 independent ski areas, including Black Mountain. It's an alternative to the Epic and Ikon multi-resort passes offered by the Vail and Alterra conglomerates.",
      "Black Mountain was an early participant in Indy Pass. When Mogensen learned it was in danger of closing, he was reminded of his hometown's long-gone ski area. He bought Black Mountain aiming to ultimately transform it into a cooperative.",
      "Many Indy Pass resorts also are clients of Entabeni Systems, including Utah's Beaver Mountain, which bills itself as the longest continuously-run family owned mountain resort in the U.S.",
      "Kristy Seeholzer, whose husband\u2019s grandfather founded Beaver Mountain, said Entabeni streamlined its ticketing and season pass system. That led to new, lower-priced passes for those willing to forgo skiing during holiday weeks or weekends, she said.",
      "\u201cA lot of our season pass holders were self-limiting anyway. They only want to ski weekdays because they don\u2019t want to deal with weekends,\u201d she said. \u201cWe could never have kept track of that manually.\"",
      "Though she is pleased overall, Seeholzer said the software can be challenging and slow.",
      "\u201cThere are some really great programs out there, like on the retail side of things or the sales side of things. And one of the things that was a little frustrating was it felt like we were reinventing the wheel,\u201d she said.",
      "Sam Shirley, 25, grew up skiing in New Hampshire and worked as a ski instructor and ski school director in Maine while attending college. But he said increasing technology has drastically changed the way he skis, pushing him to switch mostly to cross-country.",
      "\u201cAs a customer, it\u2019s made things more complicated,\u201d he said. \"It just becomes an extra hassle.\u201d",
      "Shirley used to enjoy spur-of-the-moment trips around New England, but has been put off by ski areas reserving lower rates for those who buy tickets ahead. He doesn\u2019t like having to provide detailed contact information, sometimes even a photograph, just to get a lift ticket.",
      "It's not just independent ski areas that are focused on technology and data. Many others are using lift tickets and passes embedded with radio frequency identification chips that track skiers' movements.",
      "Vail resorts pings cell phones to better understand how lift lines are forming, which informs staffing decisions, said John Plack, director of communications. Lift wait times have decreased each year for the past three years, with 97% under 10 minutes this year, he said.",
      "\u201cOur company is a wildly data-driven company. We know a lot about our guest set. We know their tastes. We know what they like to ski, we know when they like to ski. And we\u2019re able to use that data to really improve the guest experience,\u201d he said.",
      "That improvement comes at a cost. A one-day lift ticket at Vail's Keystone Resort in Colorado sold for $292 last week. A season pass cost $418, a potentially good deal for diehard skiers, but also a reliable revenue stream guaranteeing Vail a certain amount of income even as ski areas face less snow and shorter winters.",
      "The revenue from such passes, especially the multi-resort Epic Pass, allowed the company to invest $100 million in snowmaking, Plack said.",
      "\u201cBy committing to the season ahead of time, that gives us certainty and allows us to reinvest in our resorts,\" he said.",
      "Mogensen insists bigger isn\u2019t always better, however. Lift tickets at Black Mountain cost $59 to $99 per day and a season's pass is about $450.",
      "\u201cYou don\u2019t just come skiing to turn left and right. You come skiing because of the way the hot chocolate tastes and the way the fire pit smells and what spring skiing is and what the beer tastes like and who you\u2019re around,\u201d he said. \u201cSkiing doesn\u2019t have to be a luxury good. It can be a community center.\u201d",
      "Brennick, the Black Mountain lift rider who was skiing with his grandchildren, said he has noticed a difference since the ski area was sold.",
      "\u201cI can see the change,\u201d he said. \u201cThey're making a lot of snow and it shows.\u201d",

      "Under Mexico's new order, schools must phase out any food and beverage displaying even one black warning logo marking it as high in salt, sugar, calories and fat. Mexico implemented that compulsory front-of-package labeling system in 2020.",

      "Crowds have protested billionaire Elon Musk\u2019s purge of the U.S. government under President Donald Trump outside Tesla dealerships throughout the U.S. and in some cities in Europe",
      "SAN FRANCISCO -- Protesters against billionaire Elon Musk\u2019s purge of the U.S. government under President Donald Trump demonstrated outside Tesla dealerships throughout the U.S. and in some cities in Europe on Saturday in the latest attempt to dent the fortune of the world\u2019s richest man.",
      "The protesters were trying to escalate a movement targeting Tesla dealerships and vehicles in opposition to Musk\u2019s role as the head of the newly created Department of of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, where he has gained access to sensitive data and shuttered entire agencies as he attempts to slash government spending. The biggest portion of Musk\u2019s estimated $340 billion fortune consists of his stock in the electric vehicle company, which continues to run while also working alongside Trump.",
      "After earlier demonstrations that were somewhat sporadic, Saturday marked the first attempt to surround all 277 of the automaker\u2019s showrooms and service centers in the U.S. in hopes of deepening a recent decline in the company\u2019s sales.",
      "By early afternoon crowds ranging from a few dozen to hundreds of protesters had flocked to Tesla locations in New Jersey, Massachusetts, Connecticut, New York, Maryland, Minnesota and the automaker's home state of Texas. Pictures posted on social media showed protesters brandishing signs such as \u201c Honk if you hate Elon \u201d and \u201c Fight the billionaire broligarchy.\u201d",
      "As the day progressed, the protests cascaded around the country outside Tesla locations in major cities such as Washington, Chicago, Indianapolis, Cincinnati and Seattle, as well as towns in Virginia, Pennsylvania and Colorado. Smaller groups of counterprotesters also showed up at some sites.",
      "\u201cHey, hey, ho, ho, Elon Musk has got to go!\u201d several dozen people chanted outside a showroom in Dublin, California, about 35 miles (60 miles) east of San Francisco, while a smaller cluster of Trump supporters waved American flags across the street.",
      "A much larger crowd circled another showroom in nearby Berkeley, chanting slogans to the beat of drums.",
      "\u201cWe're living in a fascist state,\u201d said Dennis Fagaly, a retired high school teacher from neighboring Oakland, \u201cand we need to stop this or we'll lose our whole country and everything that is good about the United States.\u201d",
      "The Tesla Takedown movement also hoped to rally protesters at more than 230 locations in other parts of the world. Although the turnouts in Europe were not as large, the anti-Musk sentiment was similar.",
      "About two dozen people held signs lambasting the billionaire outside a dealership in London as passing cars and trucks tooted horns in support.",
      "One sign displayed depicted Musk next to an image of Adolf Hitler making the Nazi salute \u2014 a gesture that Musk has been accused of reprising shortly after Trump's Jan. 20 inauguration. A person in a Tyrannosaurus rex costume held another sign with a picture of Musk's straight-arm gesture that said, \u201cYou thought the Nazis were extinct. Don\u2019t buy a Swasticar.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe just want to get loud, make noise, make people aware of the problems that we\u2019re facing,\u201d said Cam Whitten, an American who showed up at the London protest.",
      "Tesla Takedown was organized by a group of supporters that included disillusioned owners of the automaker\u2019s vehicles, celebrities such as actor John Cusack, and at least one Democratic Party lawmaker, Rep. Jasmine Crockett from Dallas.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m going to keep screaming in the halls of Congress. I just need you all to make sure you all keep screaming in the streets,\u201d Crockett said during an organizing call this month.",
      "Another Democratic lawmaker, Rep. Pramila Jaypal, showed up at a protest in Seattle, which she represents in Congress.",
      "Some people have gone beyond protest, setting Tesla vehicles on fire or committing other acts of vandalism that U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi has decried as domestic terrorism. In a March 20 company meeting, Musk indicated that he was dumbfounded by the attacks and said the vandals should \u201cstop acting psycho.\u201d",
      "Crockett and other Tesla Takedown supporters have been stressing the importance of Saturday\u2019s protests remaining peaceful.",
      "But police were investigating a fire that destroyed seven Teslas in northwestern Germany in the early morning. It was not immediately clear if the blaze, which was extinguished by firefighters, was related to the protests.",
      "In Watertown, Massachusetts, local police reported that the side mirror of a black pickup struck two people at a protest outside a Tesla service center, according to the Boston Herald. The suspect was promptly identified by police at the scene, who said there were no serious injuries.",
      "A growing number of consumers who bought Tesla vehicles before Musk took over DOGE have been looking to sell or trade them in, while others have slapped on bumper stickers seeking to distance themselves from him.",
      "But Musk did not appear concerned about an extended slump in new sales in the March meeting, during which he reassured the workers that the company\u2019s Model Y would remain \u201cthe best-selling car on Earth again this year.\u201d He also predicted that Tesla will have sold more than 10 million cars worldwide by next year, up from about 7 million currently.",
      "\u201cThere are times when there are rocky moments, where there is stormy weather, but what I am here to tell you is that the future is incredibly bright and exciting,\u201d Musk said.",
      "After Trump was elected last November, investors initially saw Musk\u2019s alliance with the president as a positive development for Tesla and its long-running efforts to launch a network of self-driving cars.",
      "That optimism helped lift Tesla\u2019s stock by 70% between the election and Trump's Jan. 20 inauguration, creating an additional $560 billion in shareholder wealth. But virtually all those gains have evaporated amid investor worries about the backlash, lagging sales in the U.S., Europe and China, and Musk spending time overseeing DOGE.",
      "\u201cThis continues to be a moment of truth for Musk to navigate this brand tornado crisis moment and get onto the other side of this dark chapter for Tesla,\u201d Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives said in a recent research note.",

      "KAMPALA, Uganda -- In Uganda's Mbale district, famous for its production of arabica coffee, a plague of plastic bags locally known as buveera is creeping beyond the city.",
      "It's a problem that has long littered the landscape in Kampala, the capital, where buveera are woven into the fabric of daily life. They show up in layers of excavated dirt roads and clog waterways. But now, they can be found in remote areas of farmland, too. Some of the debris includes the thick plastic bags used for planting coffee seeds in nurseries.",
      "Some farmers are complaining, said Wilson Watira, head of a cultural board for the coffee-growing Bamasaba people. \u201cThey are concerned \u2013 those farmers who know the effects of buveera on the land,\u201d he said.",
      "Around the world, plastics find their way into farm fields. Climate change makes agricultural plastic, already a necessity for many crops, even more unavoidable for some farmers. Meanwhile, research continues to show that itty-bitty microplastics alter ecosystems and end up in human bodies. Scientists, farmers and consumers all worry about how that's affecting human health, and many seek solutions. But industry experts say it\u2019s difficult to know where plastic ends up or get rid of it completely, even with the best intentions of reuse and recycling programs.",
      "According to a 2021 report on plastics in agriculture by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization, soils are one of the main receptors of agricultural plastics. Some studies have estimated that soils are more polluted by microplastics than the oceans.",
      "\u201cThese things are being released at such a huge, huge scale that it\u2019s going to require major engineering solutions,\u201d said Sarah Zack, an Illinois-Indiana Sea Grant Great Lakes Contaminant Specialist who communicates about microplastics to the public.",
      "Micro-particles of plastic that come from items like clothes, medications and beauty products sometimes appear in fertilizer made from the solid byproducts of wastewater treatment \u2014 called biosolids \u2014 which can also be smelly and toxic to nearby residents depending on the treatment process used. Some seeds are coated in plastic polymers designed to strategically disintegrate at the right time of the season, used in containers to hold pesticides or stretched over fields to lock in moisture.",
      "But the agriculture industry itself only accounts for a little over 3% of all plastics used globally. About 40% of all plastics are used in packaging, including single-use plastic food and beverage containers.",
      "Microplastics, which the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration defines as being smaller than five millimeters long, are their largest at about the size of a pencil eraser. Some are much smaller.",
      "Studies have already shown that microplastics can be taken up by plants on land or plankton in the ocean and subsequently eaten by animals or humans. Scientists are still studying the long-term effects of the plastic that's been found in human organs. Early findings suggest possible links to a host of health conditions including heart disease and some cancers.",
      "Despite \u201csignificant research gaps,\u201d the evidence related to the land-based food chain \u201cis certainly raising alarm,\u201d said Lev Neretin, environment lead at the FAO, which is currently working on another technical report looking deeper into the problem of microplastic pollution in soils and crops.",
      "A study out this month in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences found that microplastics pollution can even impact plants' ability to photosynthesize, the process of turning light from the sun into energy. That doesn't \u201cjustify excessive concern\u201d but does \u201cunderscore food security risks that necessitate scientific attention,\u201d wrote Fei Dang, one of the study's authors.",
      "The use of plastics has quadrupled over the past 30 years. Plastic is ubiquitous. And most of the world's plastic goes to landfills, pollutes the environment or is burned. Less than 10% of plastics are recycled.",
      "At the same time, some farmers are becoming more reliant on plastics to shelter crops from the effects of extreme weather. They're using tarps, hoop houses and other technology to try to control conditions for their crops. And they're depending more on chemicals like pesticides and fertilizers to buffer against unreliable weather and more pervasive pest issues.",
      "\u201cThrough global warming, we have less and less arable land to make crops on. But we need more crops. So therefore the demand on agricultural chemicals is increasing,\u201d said Ole Rosgaard, president and CEO of Greif, a company that makes packaging used for industrial agriculture products like pesticides and other chemicals.",
      "Extreme weather, fueled by climate change, also contributes to the breakdown and transport of agricultural plastics. Beating sun can wear on materials over time. And more frequent and intense rainfall events in some areas could drive more plastic particles running into fields and eventually waterways, said Maryam Salehi, an associate professor of civil and environmental engineering at the University of Missouri.",
      "This past winter, leaders from around the world gathered in South Korea to produce the first legally binding global treaty on plastics pollution. They didn't reach an agreement, but the negotiations are scheduled to resume in August.",
      "Neretin said the FAO produced a provisional, voluntary code of conduct on sustainable management of plastics in agriculture. But without a formal treaty in place, most countries don't have a strong incentive to follow it.",
      "\u201cThe mood is certainly not cheery, that's for sure,\u201d he said, adding global cooperation \u201ctakes time, but the problem does not disappear.\u201d",
      "Without political will, much of the onus falls on companies.",
      "Rosgaard, of Greif, said that his company has worked to make their products recyclable, and that farmers have incentives to return them because they can get paid in exchange. But he added it's sometimes hard to prevent people from just burning the plastic or letting it end up in fields or waterways.",
      "\u201cWe just don\u2019t know where they end up all the time,\u201d he said.",
      "Some want to stop the flow of plastic and microplastic waste into ecosystems. Boluwatife Olubusoye, a Ph.D. candidate at the University of Mississippi, is trying to see whether biochar, remains of organic matter and plant waste burned under controlled conditions, can filter out microplastics that run from farm fields into waterways. His early experiments have shown promise.",
      "He said he was motivated by the feeling that there was \u201cnever any timely solution in terms of plastic waste\" ending up in fields in the first place, especially in developing countries.",
      "Even for farmers who care about plastics in soils, it can be challenging for them to do anything about it. In Uganda, owners of nursery beds cannot afford proper seedling trays, so they resort to cheaply made plastic bags used to germinate seeds, said Jacob Ogola, an independent agronomist there.",
      "Farmers hardest hit by climate change are least able to reduce the presence of cheap plastic waste in soils. That frustrates Innocent Piloya, an agroecology entrepreneur who grows coffee in rural Uganda with her company Ribbo Coffee.",

      "U.S. states are positioning themselves to compete for newer, cheaper nuclear reactors being developed as communities and tech giants compete in a race for electricity",
      "HARRISBURG, Pa. -- With the promise of newer, cheaper nuclear power on the horizon, U.S. states are vying to position themselves to build and supply the industry's next generation as policymakers consider expanding subsidies and paving over regulatory obstacles.",
      "Advanced reactor designs from competing firms are filling up the federal government's regulatory pipeline as the industry touts them as a reliable, climate-friendly way to meet electricity demands from tech giants desperate to power their fast-growing artificial intelligence platforms.",
      "The reactors could be operational as early as 2030, giving states a short runway to roll out the red carpet, and they face lingering public skepticism about safety and growing competition from renewables like wind and solar. Still, the reactors have high-level federal support, and utilities across the U.S. are working to incorporate the energy source into their portfolios.",
      "Last year, 25 states passed legislation to support advanced nuclear energy and this year lawmakers have introduced over 200 bills supportive of nuclear energy, said Marc Nichol of the Nuclear Energy Institute, a trade association whose members include power plant owners, universities and labor unions.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve seen states taking action at ever-increasing levels for the past few years now,\u201d Nichol said in an interview.",
      "Smaller reactors are, in theory, faster to build and easier to site than conventional reactors. They could be factory-built from standard parts and are touted as flexible enough to plunk down for a single customer, like a data center or an industrial complex.",
      "Advanced reactors, called small modular reactors and microreactors, produce a fraction of the energy produced by the conventional nuclear reactors built around the world for the last 50 years. Where conventional reactors produce 800 to 1,000 megawatts, or enough to power about half a million homes, modular reactors produce 300 megawatts or less and microreactors produce no more than 20 megawatts.",
      "Tech giants Amazon and Google are investing in nuclear reactors to get the power they need, as states compete with Big Tech, and each other, in a race for electricity.",
      "For some state officials, nuclear is a carbon-free source of electricity that helps them meet greenhouse gas-reduction goals. Others see it as an always-on power source to replace an accelerating wave of retiring coal-fired power plants.",
      "Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee last month proposed more than $90 million to help subsidize a Tennessee Valley Authority project to install several small reactors, boost research and attract nuclear tech firms.",
      "Long a proponent of the TVA's nuclear project, Lee also launched Tennessee's Nuclear Energy Fund in 2023, designed to attract a supply chain, including a multibillion-dollar uranium enrichment plant billed as the state's biggest-ever industrial investment.",
      "In Utah, where Gov. Spencer Cox announced \u201cOperation Gigawatt\u201d to double the state's electricity generation in a decade, the Republican wants to spend $20 million to prepare sites for nuclear. State Senate President J. Stuart Adams told colleagues when he opened the chamber's 2025 session that Utah needs to be the \u201cnation\u2019s nuclear hub.\"",
      "Texas Gov. Greg Abbott declared his state is \u201cready to be No. 1 in advanced nuclear power\" as Texas lawmakers consider billions in nuclear power incentives.",
      "Michigan lawmakers are considering millions of dollars in incentives to develop and use the reactors, as well as train a nuclear industry workforce.",
      "One state over, Indiana lawmakers this month passed legislation to let utilities more quickly seek reimbursement for the cost to build a modular reactor, undoing a decades-old prohibition designed to protect ratepayers from bloated, inefficient or, worse, aborted power projects.",
      "In Arizona, lawmakers are considering a utility-backed bill to relax environmental regulations if a utility builds a reactor at the site of a large industrial power user or a retired coal-fired power plant.",
      "Still, the devices face an uncertain future.",
      "No modular reactors are operating in the U.S. and a project to build the first, this one in Idaho, was terminated in 2023, despite getting federal aid.",
      "The U.S. Department of Energy last year, under then-President Joe Biden, estimated the U.S. will need an additional 200 gigawatts of new nuclear capacity to keep pace with future power demands and reach net-zero emissions of planet-warming greenhouse gases by 2050 to avoid the worst effects of climate change.",
      "The U.S. currently has just under 100 gigawatts of nuclear power operating. More than 30 advanced nuclear projects are under consideration or planned to be in operation by the early 2030s, Nichol of the NEI said, but those would supply just a fraction of the 200 gigawatt goal.",
      "Work to produce a modular reactor has drawn billions of dollars in federal subsidies, loan guarantees and more recently tax credits signed into law by Biden.",
      "Those have been critical to the nuclear industry, which expects them to survive under President Donald Trump, whose administration it sees as a supporter.",
      "The U.S. remains without a long-term solution for storing radioactive waste, safety regulators are under pressure from Congress to approve designs and there are serious questions about industry claims that the smaller reactors are efficient, safe and reliable, said Edwin Lyman, director of nuclear power safety at the Union of Concerned Scientists.",
      "Plus, Lyman said, \u201cthe likelihood that those are going to be deployable and instantly 100% reliable right out of the gate is just not consistent with the history of nuclear power development. And so it\u2019s a much riskier bet.\u201d",
      "Nuclear also has competition from renewable energies.",
      "Brendan Kochunas, an assistant professor of nuclear engineering at the University of Michigan, said advanced reactors may have a short window to succeed, given the regulatory scrutiny they undergo and the advances in energy storage technologies to make wind and solar power more reliable.",
      "Those storage technologies could develop faster, bring down renewables' cost and, ultimately, make more economic sense than nuclear, Kochunas said.",
      "The supply chain for building reactors is another question.",
      "The U.S. lacks high-quality concrete- and steel-fabrication design skills necessary to manufacture a nuclear power plant, Kochunas said.",
      "That introduces the prospect of higher costs and longer timelines, he said. While foreign suppliers could help, there also is the fuel to consider.",
      "Kathryn Huff, a former top Energy Department official who is now an associate professor at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, said uranium enrichment capacity in the U.S. and among its allies needs to grow in order to support reactor production.",
      "First-of-their-kind reactors need to get up and running close to their target dates, Huff said, \"in order for anyone to have faith that a second or third or fourth one should be built.\u201d",

      "A federal judge has halted the Trump administration\u2019s efforts to dismantle the Voice of America, the eight-decade-old U.S. government-funded international news service",
      "NEW YORK -- The Voice of America can\u2019t be silenced just yet.",
      "A federal judge on Friday halted the Trump administration\u2019s efforts to dismantle the eight-decade-old U.S. government-funded international news service, calling the move a \u201cclassic case of arbitrary and capricious decision making.\u201d",
      "Judge James Paul Oetken blocked the U.S. Agency for Global Media, which runs Voice of America, from firing more than 1,200 journalists, engineers and other staff that it sidelined two weeks ago in the wake of President Donald Trump ordered its funding slashed.",
      "Oetken issued a temporary restraining order barring the agency from \u201cany further attempt to terminate, reduce-in-force, place on leave, or furlough\u201d employees or contractors, and from closing any offices or requiring overseas employees to return to the U.S.",
      "The order also bars the Agency for Global Media from terminating grant funding for its other broadcast outlets, including Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, Radio Free Asia and Radio Free Afghanistan. The agency said Thursday it was restoring Radio Free Europe\u2019s funding after a judge in Washington, D.C. ordered it to do so.",
      "\u201cThis is a decisive victory for press freedom and the First Amendment, and a sharp rebuke\u201d to the Trump administration\u2019s \u201cutter disregard for the principles that define our democracy,\u201d said the plaintiffs\u2019 lawyer Andrew G. Celli Jr.",
      "At a hearing Friday in Manhattan, Oetken faulted the Trump administration for \u201ctaking a sledgehammer to an agency that has been statutorily authorized and funded by Congress.\u201d",
      "The judge criticized the agency\u2019s leadership, including special adviser Kari Lake, for pulling the plug \u201cseemingly overnight\u201d on the U.S. government\u2019s global, soft-power megaphone with \u201cno consideration of the effects.\u201d",
      "Oetken ruled after a coalition of Voice of America journalists, labor unions and the nonprofit journalism advocacy group Reporters Without Borders sued the Trump administration last week to block the cuts. Ultimately, they seek to have VOA return to the air.",
      "The plaintiffs argued the shutdown violated a court\u2019s finding during Trump\u2019s first term that VOA journalists have a free-speech firewall protecting them from White House interference. Their absence from the airwaves has left a vacuum that\u2019s being filled by \u201cpropagandists whose messages will monopolize global airwaves,\u201d the plaintiffs said.",
      "Trump and other Republicans have accused Voice of America of a \u201cleftist bias\u201d and failing to project \u201cpro-American\u201d values to its worldwide audience, even though it is mandated by congress to serve as a non-partisan news organization.",
      "Voice of America went off the air soon after Trump issued an executive order on March 14 that pared funding to the Agency for Global Media and six other unrelated federal entities \u2014 part of his campaign to shrink government and align its with his political agenda.",
      "The White House called the service \u201cThe Voice of Radical America\u201d and said Trump\u2019s order would \u201censure that taxpayers are no longer on the hook for radical propaganda.\u201d It cited coverage it said was \u201ctoo favorable\u201d to former President Joe Biden, as well as stories about white privilege, racial profiling and transgender migrants seeking asylum.",
      "Congress has appropriated nearly $860 million for the Agency for Global Media for the current fiscal year.",
      "Three federal lawsuits in Washington, D.C. are challenging other aspects of the cuts, including one brought by Voice of America\u2019s director and three journalists. Oetken said he\u2019ll rule at a later date on the government\u2019s request to move his case there.",
      "Voice of America has operated since World War II, beaming news into authoritarian countries that don\u2019t have a free press. It began as a counterpoint to Nazi propaganda and played a prominent role in the U.S. government\u2019s Cold War efforts to curb the spread of communism.",
      "According to the lawsuit, Voice of America employees were told to finish their live broadcasts on March 15, then vacate the building. Soon after, the lawsuit said, they lost access to agency computer systems, including email. Voice of America\u2019s news website hasn\u2019t been updated since.",
      "Lake, a former TV news anchor and political candidate, said she has been determining how many people are required to operate some of these outlets at the minimum staffing levels allowed by law.",
      "Some people have been brought back to work and at least one service \u2014 Radio Marti in Cuba \u2014 has returned to the air, Lake told One America News Network in an interview posted Thursday on X.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re going to get lawsuits,\u201d Lake said. \u201cThis is just par for the course. We\u2019ve been victims \u2014 President Trump has, I myself have \u2014 of \u2018lawfare\u2019. It\u2019s the same cast of characters that is trying to put landmines in the ways of every step President Trump and this administration is trying to do to get this government back in line to where we can actually afford it.\u201d",
      "Lake, echoing the White House\u2019s complaints, said: \u201cWe want to make sure that these agencies are in line with what our American values are. We\u2019re telling America\u2019s story. We\u2019re not telling our adversaries\u2019 stories.\u201d",
      "\u201cBy God,\" she said, \u201cwe\u2019re not going to be putting out anti-American garbage.\u201d",

      "SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico -- An abrupt announcement rattled members of a little-known U.N. agency based in Jamaica that has protected international deep-sea waters for more than 30 years.",
      "The Metals Company in Vancouver, Canada said late Thursday that it is seeking permission from the U.S. government to start deep-sea mining in international waters, potentially bypassing the International Seabed Authority, which has the power to authorize exploitation permits but has yet to do so.",
      "\u201cIt would be a major breach of international law\u2026if the U.S. were to grant it,\u201d said Duncan Currie, an international and environmental lawyer and legal adviser to the Deep Sea Conservation Coalition, a Netherlands-based alliance of environmental groups.",
      "The Metals Company seeks seafloor minerals like cobalt, copper, nickel and manganese used in electric car batteries and other green technology.",
      "The announcement was made just hours before the 36-member council of the International Seabed Authority met in Jamaica on Friday, the last day of a two-week conference focused on how and if to allow deep-sea mining, a years-long debate.",
      "The authority was scheduled to talk Friday about the company\u2019s commercial mining application.",
      "\u201cThe scale of the threat\u2026has been taken incredibly seriously here,\u201d said Louisa Casson, a campaigner at Greenpeace who attended Friday's meeting. \u201cThere are questions and a lack of clarity of what they actually plan on doing.\u201d",
      "She said one question is whether the company plans to request a permit anyway from the authority even as it continues talks with the U.S. government.",
      "Currie said the timing of The Metals Company\u2019s announcement was \u201cinsulting to the ISA.\u201d",

      "The International Seabed Authority was created in 1994 by the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, which is ratified by more than 165 nations \u2014 but not the United States.",
      "The Metals Company argued that the United States\u2019 seabed mining code would allow it to start operations in international waters since it's not a member of the authority and therefore not bound by its rules.",
      "The company said it was already in discussions with the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, among others.",
      "\u201cWe have met with numerous officials in the White House as well as U.S. Congress regarding their support for this industry,\u201d the company said in a statement.",

      "The authority has issued more than 30 exploration licenses but no provisional licenses.",
      "Most of the current exploration is happening in the Clarion-Clipperton Fracture Zone, which covers 1.7 million square miles (4.5 million square kilometers) between Hawaii and Mexico. It is occurring at depths ranging from 13,000 to 19,000 feet (4,000 to 6,000 meters).",

Letting deep-sea mining go forward now would be like starting a fire in a library of books nobody\u2019s even read yet,\" said Emily Jeffers, a senior attorney at the Center for Biological Diversity.",

      "LAS VEGAS -- Nevada gaming regulators have issued a $10.5 million fine against the Resorts World casino on the Las Vegas Strip over allegations of illegal gambling, many of which centered on a bookmaker with ties to the interpreter for baseball star Shohei Ohtani.",
      "The fine settles a complaint that the state Gaming Control Board filed last year accusing one of the largest casinos on the Strip of welcoming people with ties to illegal bookmaking and people with a history of gambling-related felony convictions, the Las Vegas Review-Journal reported.",
      "The fine, issued on Thursday, is the second-largest handed down by the Nevada Gaming Commission, which has authority over disciplinary action.",

      "Childs died on Wednesday in Pelham, New York, from Lewy body dementia, which had been diagnosed in September, his son, Nicholas Childs said.",
      "While he was perhaps best known for his work on One World Trade Center, considered to be the tallest building in the Western Hemisphere, Childs also was instrumental in other important projects, including a new master plan for the National Mall in Washington, D.C., an expansion of Dulles International Airport in Virginia and the 7 World Trade Center building in Manhattan, according to his firm, Skidmore, Owings & Merrill.",
      "\u201cDavid\u2019s contribution to the firm was extensive and profound, and we will always be grateful to David for his leadership, his impact, and his friendship,\u201d Skidmore, Owings & Merrill said in a statement. \u201cWe will miss him dearly and extend our condolences and deepest sympathies to his family.\u201d",
      "A fond memory that Nicholas Childs has was when his father drew a rendering of what the One World Trade Center property would look like while they were out having lunch in New York, some years after 9/11 but well before the plans were finalized.",
      "\u201cHe picked up a paper napkin, took out a pen, and drew what became the ultimate design of the building on the napkin for me,\u201d Nicholas Childs said in a phone interview Friday, adding that he still has the drawing.",
      "He said his father was a civic-minded architect who would often use a quote by 20th century American-German architect Ludwig Mies van der Rohe \u2014 \u201cGod is in the details.\u201d",
      "\u201cHe cared deeply about those details and making something beautiful,\u201d Nicholas Childs said. \u201cBut he also wanted to make sure, I think as any great architect, that it was a balance of form and function, that it worked for people.\u201d",
      "The 1,776-foot-tall (540-meter-tall) One World Trade Center, once known as the Freedom Tower, is the centerpiece of the redevelopment of ground zero, along with the memorial pools placed where the Twin Towers stood. Opened in 2014, it sports a steel and glass structure that rises into the sky with a tapered, eight-triangle body, topped by a 408-foot-tall (124-meter-tall) needle.",
      "The final design was produced after contentious negotiations between Childs and Daniel Libeskind, who designed the overall plan for the site, and arguments between government officials over what should be built at ground zero and objections by some relatives of 9/11 victims to the design of the Trade Center memorial.",
      "Libeskind had drawn the first plans for building, a twisting glass skyscraper with an off-center spire meant to invoke the Statue of Liberty.",
      "Childs produced a sleeker version of Libeskind\u2019s design, then reworked it after police expressed concerns that the building was not sturdy enough to withstand a truck bomb.",
      "In announcing the new design plans, Childs said the One World Trade Center tower is \u201ciconic, simple and pure in its form, a memorable form that will reclaim the resilience and the spirit of our democracy.\u201d",
      "He also called it \u201cthe safest building in the world,\u201d with features including wider staircases, a separate stairway and elevator for firefighters, \u201cblast-resistant glazing\u201d and more public stairways with direct access to the street.",
      "Childs was born in Princeton, New Jersey, in 1941 and grew up in his early childhood years in Washington, D.C., before moving to Mount Kisco, New York. He attended the private Deerfield Academy in Deerfield, Massachusetts, before going to Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut, where he earned a bachelor's degree and a master's degree in architecture.",
      "He was hired by Skidmore, Owings & Merrill in 1971 for its Washington, D.C., office, where he worked on projects including a new master plan for the National Mall, the Constitution Gardens park along the mall and the Four Seasons Hotel.",
      "He transferred to the firm's New York City office in 1984 and had a hand in significant projects in the city, including 1 Worldwide Plaza in the Hell's Kitchen section of Manhattan and the Deutsche Bank Center, formerly called the Time Warner Center, with its twin skyscraper towers at Columbus Circle.",
      "Childs also worked on the U.S. embassy in Ottawa, Canada, the Canary Wharf development in London and King Abdulaziz International Airport in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.",
      "In 2004, he was honored with a Rome Prize for architecture, awarded by the American Academy in Rome for innovative work in the arts and humanities.",
      "Childs is survived by his wife, Annie; three children, Nicholas, Joshua and Jocelyn; and several grandchildren.",
      "The family is planning a small, private memorial in the coming weeks, followed by a larger service around May, Nicholas Childs said.",

      "A jury in New York City returned its verdict after a five-week trial. Javice, 32, faces the possibility of a lengthy prison term.",

      "The company promoted itself as a way for financially needy students to obtain more aid faster, in return for a few hundred dollars in fees. Javice appeared regularly on cable news programs to boost Frank\u2019s profile, once appearing on Forbes\u2019 \u201c30 Under 30\u201d list before JPMorgan bought the startup in 2021.",
      "JPMorgan executives testified that she told them she had over four million clients and would have about 10 million by year\u2019s end, but it turned out there were only about 300,000 customers.",
      "Javice\u2019s lawyer, Jose Baez, told the jury that JPMorgan knew what it was getting in the deal, and made up the fraud allegations due to buyer\u2019s remorse after government regulatory changes made the data it received in the deal useless to its hopes of gaining new young customers.",

I just have this internal dialogue and I\u2019m just able to almost be calm and just be in my heart,\u201d Naumov said. \u201cAnd they\u2019re always there, too. And every time I think of them, especially when I\u2019m on the ice, it really, really helps me get through.\u201d",
      "The world championships, which had previously been scheduled at the home of Boston's Celtics and Bruins, brought renewed attention to the plane crash and the century-old Skating Club of Boston that has been a home for Olympians and recreational skaters alike.",
      "There was a tribute on Wednesday, sandwiched between the day's two sessions, and frequent reminders of the tragedy.",
      "Alisa Efimova and Misha Mitrofanov, who finished sixth in pairs this weekend, held up pictures of the Boston club members who died in the crash: two young skaters, their mothers and the two coaches. Reigning U.S. champion Amber Glenn wore a T-shirt honoring the memory of all the young skaters who were lost.",
      "Ilia Malinin, the \u201cQuad God\u201d who won his second straight world championship on Saturday night, finished the show on Sunday with a performance that he said was dedicated to the plane crash victims. He came to the end, red-eyed and choking back tears.",
      "Naumov\u2019s introduction on Sunday identified him as a member of the Boston club and included his three fourth-place finishes at nationals. It didn\u2019t mention the crash, but many in the crowd surely knew his connection: He received not only the polite applause that greeted most of the other skaters, but a second wave, with individuals standing to cheer him on.",
      "Wearing unadorned black pants and a sparkly black top, a gold chain flopping around his neck as he glided across the ice, Naumov gave a gala performance aimed more at emotion than proof of athletic prowess.",
      "The choice of music, Mac Miller\u2019s posthumous 2020 release \u201cThat\u2019s on Me,\u201d was intentional. Miller died of an accidental drug overdose in 2018.",
      "\u201cLately, for some reason \u2014 well, not for some reason \u2014 but lately I\u2019ve just been listening to Mac Miller\u2019s album \u2018Circles.\u2019 Like just over and over and over,\u201d Naumov said. \u201cAnd knowing the unfortunate story about him as an artist, it\u2019s been very relatable.",
      "\u201cI relate to it, and I feel really deeply and emotionally what he\u2019s talking about in those songs. And it\u2019s also been really helpful for me to almost get my emotions out in that way personally.\u201d",
      "When his skate was over, Naumov took a deep breath, patted his heart again and waved in each direction. His bows were deep and poignant. Leaving the ice after a one-minute standing ovation, he made the sign of the cross.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of emotions just right now, and it\u2019s hard to even put a name to what I\u2019m feeling currently,\" he said. \"I just feel so much support, and it\u2019s very overwhelming.",
      "\u201cI have so much gratitude,\" Naumov said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m thankful for each and every single one of those fans.\u201d",

      "The utility announced that its board picked Moul as president and chief executive to replace Jeff Lyash, who said in January that he would retire no later than September.

With the firing of Michelle Moore, an appointee of former President Joe Biden, the board currently has five members and four vacancies.",

      "In 2020, Trump fired the former TVA board chairman and another board member and drove TVA to reverse course on the hiring of foreign labor for information technology jobs.",
      "He also called for Lyash\u2019s replacement and the position\u2019s pay to be capped at $500,000.",
      "In response, TVA has noted that the CEO pay ranks in the bottom quartile of the power industry. Lyash\u2019s total compensation topped $10.5 million in the 2024 budget year, including various pension and performance incentives worth millions of dollars. Additionally, the utility has stressed that it doesn\u2019t receive federal taxpayer money and instead is funded by electricity customers.",

      "Most rescues happen in the 24 hours after a disaster. The chances of survival drop with each day after that, experts say. Most victims are badly injured or buried by falling stones or other debris.",
      "Trapped victims are more likely to survive if they are in a debris-free pocket that prevents major injury while they await rescue, like under a sturdy desk, said geophysicist Victor Tsai from Brown University in an email. Experts call this a survivable void space.",
      "If fire, smoke or hazardous chemicals were released as a result of the building collapse, they may decrease a person's survival odds, said emergency response expert Dr. Joseph Barbera, an associate professor at George Washington University.",
      "Beyond that, having air to breathe and water to drink are crucial as the days go on.",
      "\u201cYou could survive a while without food,\u201d Barbera said. \u201cYou could survive less without water.\u201d",
      "Temperatures where someone is trapped may affect survival, and temperatures outside the rubble can affect rescue missions.",
      "Power outages and spotty communications have slowed relief operations in Myanmar, where many are searching for survivors by hand in daily temperatures above 40 degrees Celsius (104 Fahrenheit). A lack of heavy machinery has slowed search-and-rescue efforts.",
      "It can be important for survivors to receive vital medical care before they are removed from the rubble, Barbera said. If not, the buildup of toxins from crushed muscles could make them go into shock after they are rescued.",
      "After the 2011 earthquake and tsunami in Japan, a teenager and his 80-year-old grandmother were found alive after nine days trapped in their flattened home. And the year before, a 16-year-old Haitian girl was rescued from earthquake rubble in Port-Au-Prince after 15 days.",
      "The best practices for survival during an earthquake depend on where you are in the world. Building codes in regions with active fault lines are often designed to withstand earthquakes, but that doesn't hold true everywhere.",
      "In many countries, including the United States, the best practices are to drop, seek cover and hang on unless you are close to a building exit. Seek shelter under a heavy table or near sturdy furniture that may yield a survivable pocket if the roof collapses. Cover your face with cloth or a mask to protect from dust and debris.",
      "If you are trapped in the rubble after and earthquake, save your energy and don't overexert. Ration food and water, listen for rescue calls and search for something near you to make noise. If you have a phone with you, conserve its battery and try for help in short spurts each day.",

      "Just after sunrise on Saturday, a satellite set its long-range camera on the city of Mandalay in Myanmar, not far from the epicenter of Friday\u2019s 7.7 magnitude earthquake that devastated the Southeast Asian county's second-largest city.",

      "The clouds eventually moved and it took a few more hours for another satellite from San Francisco-based Planet Labs to capture the aerial pictures and send them to Microsoft's philanthropic AI for Good Lab. By then it was already about 11 p.m. Friday at Microsoft headquarters in Redmond, Washington. A group of Microsoft workers was ready and waiting for the data.",
      "The AI for Good lab has done this kind of AI-assisted damage assessment before, tracking the flooding that devastated Libya in 2023 or this year's wildfires in Los Angeles. But rather than rely on a standard AI computer vision model that could run any visual data, they had to build a customized version specific to Mandalay.",
      "\u201cThe Earth is too different, the natural disasters are too different and the imagery we get from satellites is just too different to work in every situation,\u201d Lavista Ferres said. For instance, he said, while fires spread in fairly predictable ways, \u201can earthquake touches the whole city\u201d and it can be harder to know in the immediate aftermath where help is needed.",
      "Once the AI analysis was complete, it showed 515 buildings in Mandalay with 80% to 100% damage and another 1,524 with between 20% and 80% damage. That showed the widespread gravity of the disaster, but, just as important, it helps pinpoint specific locations of damage.",
      "\u201cThis is critical information for teams on the ground,\u201d Lavista Ferres said.",
      "Microsoft cautioned that it \"should serve as a preliminary guide and will require on-the-ground verification for a complete understanding.\" But in the meantime, the tech company has shared the analysis with aid groups such as the Red Cross.",

      "\u201cWe stopped and took some photos and neither one of us had any idea,\u201d Manley said. \u201cI could get it to family but I couldn\u2019t figure out any more than that. So we took photos and moved on, not realizing we had found a new genus.\u201d",
      "When Manley got back from the hike, she started researching what the flower could be. She soon found that not only was she stumped, but others were too. Her post about the flower on iNaturalist, an online platform for nature enthusiasts \u201ccaused a stir,\u201d said Isaac Lichter Marck, a researcher at the California Academy of Sciences in San Francisco.",
      "A. Michael Powell, curator and director of the herbarium at Sul Russ State University in Alpine, said when Manley contacted him about the flower, he immediately thought it was something new.",
      "\u201cIt wasn\u2019t anything I\u2019d seen before,\u201d said Powell, who has extensively studied the region.",
      "By the time a team went to collect samples of the flower a few weeks after the discovery, they had already begun to wither away.",
      "\u201cWe really got out there just in the nick of time before the specimens would have been completely dried up,\u201d Whiting said.",
      "The discovery of the flower was announced last month.",
      "Lichter Marck said they were able to extract DNA from the flower but that there's still a lot to learn. He said they don\u2019t know yet how it reproduces, or what potential uses it might have. They also need to determine if it\u2019s endangered.",
      "The wooly devil's official name \u2014 Ovicula biradiata \u2014 takes inspiration from its appearance: Ovicula, which means tiny sheep, is a nod to the hairs that cover its leaves; while biradiata, or bi-radial, refers to its two striped petals.",
      "Kelsey Wogan, environmental lab manager at Sul Ross State University, said she\u2019s excited to see if the wooly devil can be found in other places as well and what its range is.",
      "Whiting said the park is so well-studied that finding a new species was a surprise.",
      "\u201cThe fact that there\u2019s still species out there that had slipped under the radar is pretty remarkable,\u201d she said.",
      "Wogan said part of the excitement about the flower's discovery is that it shows \u201cthere\u2019s still new and undescribed things out there.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the great reminder to keep your eyes open,\" she said, \"and if you don\u2019t know what something is, it might be completely new.\u201d",

      "Although it\u2019s still experimental, they hope the brain-computer interface could someday help give voice to those unable to speak.",
      "A new study described testing the device on a 47-year-old woman with quadriplegia who couldn\u2019t speak for 18 years after a stroke. Doctors implanted it in her brain during surgery as part of a clinical trial.",
      "It \u201cconverts her intent to speak into fluent sentences,\u201d said Gopala Anumanchipalli, a co-author of the study published Monday in the journal Nature Neuroscience.",
      "Other brain-computer interfaces, or BCIs, for speech typically have a slight delay between thoughts of sentences and computerized verbalization. Such delays can disrupt the natural flow of conversation, potentially leading to miscommunication and frustration, researchers said.",
      "This is \"a pretty big advance in our field,\u201d said Jonathan Brumberg of the Speech and Applied Neuroscience Lab at the University of Kansas, who was not part of the study.",
      "A team in California recorded the woman\u2019s brain activity using electrodes while she spoke sentences silently in her brain. The scientists used a synthesizer they built using her voice before her injury to create a speech sound that she would have spoken. They trained an AI model that translates neural activity into units of sound.",
      "It works similar to existing systems used to transcribe meetings or phone calls in real time, said Anumanchipalli, of the University of California, Berkeley.",
      "The implant itself sits on the speech center of the brain so that it\u2019s listening in, and those signals are translated to pieces of speech that make up sentences. It\u2019s a \u201cstreaming approach,\u201d Anumanchipalli said, with each 80-millisecond chunk of speech \u2013 about half a syllable \u2013 sent into a recorder.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not waiting for a sentence to finish,\u201d Anumanchipalli said. \u201cIt\u2019s processing it on the fly.\u201d",
      "Decoding speech that quickly has the potential to keep up with the fast pace of natural speech, said Brumberg. The use of voice samples, he added, \u201cwould be a significant advance in the naturalness of speech.\"",
      "Though the work was partially funded by the National Institutes of Health, Anumanchipalli said it wasn't affected by recent NIH research cuts. More research is needed before the technology is ready for wide use, but with \u201csustained investments,\" it could be available to patients within a decade, he said.",

      "Huawei Technologies reported 62.6 billion yuan ($8.6 billion) in net profit last year, down from 87 billion yuan the year before. Its revenue jumped 22% to $118.2 billion, with the strongest growth in its consumer goods and automotive-related sales.",
      "The company, based in the southern city of Shenzhen, said the decline in profit was mainly due to two factors, \u201cWe continued to increase our future-oriented investment and there were no gains from the sale of businesses.\u201d",
      "One of China's first global tech brands, Huawei said its spending on research and development amounted to more than a fifth of its revenues, and more than half its workforce, or 113,000 people, are employed in R&D.",
      "Spending on R&D was 179.7 billion yuan (nearly $25 billion).",

      "PARIS -- France\u2019s antitrust watchdog fined Apple 150 million euros ($162 million) on Monday over a privacy feature protecting users from apps snooping on them because its introduction resulted in abuse of competition law.",

      "Apple rolled out ATT starting in April 2021 as part of an update to the operating system powering the iPhone and iPad. The feature forces apps to obtain permission before collecting data to target users with personalized ads. While the feature was designed to tighten up privacy, it faced criticism from Big Tech rivals that it would make it harder for smaller apps to survive without charging consumers.",
      "The fine, punishing Apple for abuse of its dominant position in mobile app distribution, covers the period from April 2021 to July 2023. But the amount is a pittance for the iPhone maker, which earned $124 billion in revenue in the final three months of last year.",

      "It also questioned the system\u2019s neutrality, saying it penalized the smallest publishers, which depend to a large extent on the collection of third-party data to finance their activity.",

      "There is plenty of nostalgia at Black Mountain, New Hampshire's oldest ski area",
      "Jackson, N.H. -- A skier since age 4, Thomas Brennick now enjoys regular trips to New Hampshire\u2019s Black Mountain with his two grandchildren.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s back to the old days,\u201d he said from the Summit Double chairlift on a recent sunny Friday. \u201cIt's just good, old-time skiing at its best.\u201d",
      "Behind the scenes, the experience is now propelled by a high-tech system designed to increase efficiency at the state\u2019s oldest ski area. And while small, independent resorts can\u2019t compete on infrastructure or buying power with conglomerates like Vail, which owns nearby Attitash Mountain Resort and seven others in the Northeast alone, at least one entrepreneur is betting technology will be \u201ca really great equalizer.\u201d",
      "That businessman is Erik Mogensen, who bought Black Mountain last year and turned it into a lab for his ski mountain consultancy, Entabeni Systems. The company builds systems that put lift tickets sales, lesson reservations and equipment rentals online while collecting detailed data to inform decisions such as where to make more snow and how much.",
      "\u201cA lot of general managers will go out and look at how many rows of cars are parked, and that\u2019s kind of how they tell how busy they are,\u201d Mogensen said. \u201cWe really want to look at that transactional data down to the deepest level.\u201d",
      "That includes analyzing everything from the most popular time to sell hot dogs in the lodge to how many runs a season pass holder makes per visit.",
      "\u201cThe large operators, they can do a lot of things at scale that we can\u2019t. They can buy 20 snow cats at a time, 10 chairlifts, those types of things. We can\u2019t do that, but we\u2019re really nimble,\u201d Mogensen said. \u201cWe can decide to change the way we groom very quickly, or change the way we open trails, or change our (food and beverage) menu in the middle of a day.\u201d",
      "Mogensen, who says his happiest moments are tied to skiing, started Entabeni Systems in 2015, driven by the desire to keep the sport accessible. In 2023, he bought the company Indy Pass, which allows buyers to ski for two days each at 230 independent ski areas, including Black Mountain. It's an alternative to the Epic and Ikon multi-resort passes offered by the Vail and Alterra conglomerates.",
      "Black Mountain was an early participant in Indy Pass. When Mogensen learned it was in danger of closing, he was reminded of his hometown's long-gone ski area. He bought Black Mountain aiming to ultimately transform it into a cooperative.",
      "Many Indy Pass resorts also are clients of Entabeni Systems, including Utah's Beaver Mountain, which bills itself as the longest continuously-run family owned mountain resort in the U.S.",
      "Kristy Seeholzer, whose husband\u2019s grandfather founded Beaver Mountain, said Entabeni streamlined its ticketing and season pass system. That led to new, lower-priced passes for those willing to forgo skiing during holiday weeks or weekends, she said.",
      "\u201cA lot of our season pass holders were self-limiting anyway. They only want to ski weekdays because they don\u2019t want to deal with weekends,\u201d she said. \u201cWe could never have kept track of that manually.\"",
      "Though she is pleased overall, Seeholzer said the software can be challenging and slow.",
      "\u201cThere are some really great programs out there, like on the retail side of things or the sales side of things. And one of the things that was a little frustrating was it felt like we were reinventing the wheel,\u201d she said.",
      "Sam Shirley, 25, grew up skiing in New Hampshire and worked as a ski instructor and ski school director in Maine while attending college. But he said increasing technology has drastically changed the way he skis, pushing him to switch mostly to cross-country.",
      "\u201cAs a customer, it\u2019s made things more complicated,\u201d he said. \"It just becomes an extra hassle.\u201d",
      "Shirley used to enjoy spur-of-the-moment trips around New England, but has been put off by ski areas reserving lower rates for those who buy tickets ahead. He doesn\u2019t like having to provide detailed contact information, sometimes even a photograph, just to get a lift ticket.",
      "It's not just independent ski areas that are focused on technology and data. Many others are using lift tickets and passes embedded with radio frequency identification chips that track skiers' movements.",
      "Vail resorts pings cell phones to better understand how lift lines are forming, which informs staffing decisions, said John Plack, director of communications. Lift wait times have decreased each year for the past three years, with 97% under 10 minutes this year, he said.",
      "\u201cOur company is a wildly data-driven company. We know a lot about our guest set. We know their tastes. We know what they like to ski, we know when they like to ski. And we\u2019re able to use that data to really improve the guest experience,\u201d he said.",
      "That improvement comes at a cost. A one-day lift ticket at Vail's Keystone Resort in Colorado sold for $292 last week. A season pass cost $418, a potentially good deal for diehard skiers, but also a reliable revenue stream guaranteeing Vail a certain amount of income even as ski areas face less snow and shorter winters.",
      "The revenue from such passes, especially the multi-resort Epic Pass, allowed the company to invest $100 million in snowmaking, Plack said.",
      "\u201cBy committing to the season ahead of time, that gives us certainty and allows us to reinvest in our resorts,\" he said.",
      "Mogensen insists bigger isn\u2019t always better, however. Lift tickets at Black Mountain cost $59 to $99 per day and a season's pass is about $450.",
      "\u201cYou don\u2019t just come skiing to turn left and right. You come skiing because of the way the hot chocolate tastes and the way the fire pit smells and what spring skiing is and what the beer tastes like and who you\u2019re around,\u201d he said. \u201cSkiing doesn\u2019t have to be a luxury good. It can be a community center.\u201d",
      "Brennick, the Black Mountain lift rider who was skiing with his grandchildren, said he has noticed a difference since the ski area was sold.",
      "\u201cI can see the change,\u201d he said. \u201cThey're making a lot of snow and it shows.\u201d",

      "In his letter, which was obtained by The Associated Press, Marks said he was \u201cwilling to work\u201d to address the concerns expressed by Robert F. Kennedy Jr., about the safety of vaccinations. But he concluded that wasn't possible.",
      "\u201cIt has become clear that truth and transparency are not desired by the Secretary, but rather he wishes subservient confirmation of his misinformation and lies,\u201d he wrote.",
      "The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "Marks was offered the choice of resigning or being fired by Kennedy, according to a former FDA official familiar with the discussions, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he didn\u2019t have permission to discuss the matter publicly.",
      "Kennedy has a long history of spreading anti-vaccine misinformation, although during his Senate confirmation hearings he seemed to say he would not undermine vaccines. He promised the chair of the Senate health committee that he would not change existing vaccine recommendations.",
      "Since becoming commissioner, Kennedy has vowed to scrutinize the safety of childhood vaccinations, despite decades of evidence they are safe and have saved millions of lives.",
      "Marks oversaw the agency\u2019s rapid review and approval of COVID-19 vaccines and treatments during the pandemic.",
      "Marks is credited with coining the name and concept for \u201cOperation Warp Speed,\u201d the effort under President Donald Trump to rapidly manufacture vaccines while they were still being tested for safety and efficacy. The initiative cut years off the normal development process.",
      "Despite the project\u2019s success, Trump repeatedly lashed out at the FDA for not approving the first COVID shots even sooner. Trump told confidants after his 2020 loss that he would have been re-elected if the vaccine had been available before Election Day.",
      "Dr. Paul Offit, a vaccine expert at Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia, criticized what he called the \u201cfiring\u201d of Marks.",
      "\u201cRFK Jr.\u2019s firing of Peter Marks because he wouldn\u2019t bend a knee to his misinformation campaign now allows the fox to guard the hen house,\" Offit said. \u201cIt\u2019s a sad day for America\u2019s children.\u201d",
      "Former FDA Commissioner Dr. Robert Califf said the issues raised in Marks' resignation letter \u201cshould be frightening to anyone committed to the importance of evidence to guide policies and patient decisions.\u201d",
      "\u201cI hope this will intensify the communication across academia, industry and government to bolster the importance of science and evidence,\u201d he wrote.",
      "The resignation follows news Friday that HHS plans to lay off 10,000 workers and shut down entire agencies, including ones that oversee billions of dollars in funds for addiction services and community health centers across the country.",
      "In a post on social media Thursday, Kennedy criticized the department he oversees as an inefficient \u201csprawling bureaucracy.\" He also faulted the department\u2019s 82,000 workers for a decline in Americans\u2019 health.",
      "The resignation is the latest blow to the beleaguered health agency, which has been rocked for weeks by layoffs, retirements and a chaotic return-to-office process that left many staffers without permanent offices, desks or other supplies. Last month, Jim Jones, the FDA\u2019s deputy commissioner for foods, resigned, citing \u201cthe indiscriminate firing\u201d of nearly 90 staffers in his division, according to a copy of his resignation letter obtained by the AP.",
      "Marks, who could not be reached for comment, also raised concerns in his letter about \u201cefforts currently being advanced by some on the adverse health effects of vaccination are concerning\u201d as well as the \u201cunprecedented assault on scientific truth that has adversely impacted public health in our nation.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "A major 7.7 magnitude earthquake that originated near Mandalay, Myanmar shook the Earth as far as Bangkok",
      "Early Friday, a major 7.7 magnitude earthquake that originated near Mandalay, Myanmar, shook the Earth as far as Bangkok, about 800 miles (1,300 kilometers) away.",
      "Two hard-hit cities in Myanmar suffered extensive damage, with images from the capital, Naypyidaw, showing rescue crews pulling victims from the rubble of collapsed buildings. Authorities in Bangkok said deaths had occurred at three construction sites, including a high-rise that collapsed.",
      "Experts say the earthquake, which occurred along the Sagaing Fault, was close to the Earth's surface, generating intense seismic forces. Preliminary estimates by the U.S. Geological Survey show that nearly 800,000 people in Myanmar may have been within the zone of the most violent shaking and that death tolls exceeding 1,000 people, and perhaps much higher, are probable.",
      "The Earth's crust is broken up into several pieces called tectonic plates, which fit together like a jigsaw puzzle.",
      "This formation is \u201cmostly stable, but along the edges they are moving,\u201d Columbia University geophysicist Michael Steckler said.",
      "Pressure builds up when sliding plates get stuck, increasing \u201cvery slowly for decades or for hundreds of years, and then all of a sudden the rock plates will jump,\" triggering shaking that causes an earthquake, Steckler said.",
      "Earthquakes typically occur along edges of tectonic plates. But their impacts may be felt in a broader region.",
      "Earthquakes that occur in the ocean don't always attract attention, but those that occur close to where people live can cause deaths and injuries, most often from collapsed buildings.",
      "Scientists have a good idea of where earthquakes are likely to occur, \"but we can't predict when they'll occur,\u201d USGS seismologist Will Yeck said.",
      "However, after the initial big earthquake, researchers are able to project that other smaller earthquakes nearby, called aftershocks, are likely.",
      "Aftershocks are triggered \u201cbecause of changes to stress in the Earth from the main shock,\u201d Yeck said.",
      "Given the magnitude of the quake in Myanmar, \u201cyou will probably see aftershocks for the next several months,\u201d Steckler said.",
      "In regions of the world with known active fault lines, including California and Japan, building codes are often designed to withstand earthquakes. But that's not true everywhere.",
      "\u201cIf you feel shaking, the guidance depends on where you are in the world,\u201d Yeck said.",
      "In many countries, including the United States, if you're inside when an earthquake occurs, it's advisable to drop to the ground, cover your head \u2014 for example, by crawling under a desk or other sturdy structure \u2014 and hold onto that structure, he said. Try to avoid areas near glass windows and don't use building elevators.",
      "If you're outside, try to remain in an area away from buildings or trees that could fall.",
      "Depending on the location, there may be secondary hazards triggered by earthquakes, such as landslides, fires or tsunamis, he said.",

      "LOS ANGELES -- Fans of Studio Ghibli, the famed Japanese animation studio behind \u201cSpirited Away\u201d and other beloved movies, were delighted this week when a new version of ChatGPT let them transform popular internet memes or personal photos into the distinct style of Ghibli founder Hayao Miyazaki.",
      "But the trend also highlighted ethical concerns about artificial intelligence tools trained on copyrighted creative works and what that means for the future livelihoods of human artists. Miyazaki, 84, known for his hand-drawn approach and whimsical storytelling, has expressed skepticism about AI's role in animation.",
      "Janu Lingeswaran wasn't thinking much about that when he uploaded a photo of his 3-year-old ragdoll cat, Mali, into ChatGPT's new image generator tool on Wednesday. He then asked ChatGPT to convert it to the Ghibli style, instantly making an anime image that looked like Mali but also one of the painstakingly drawn feline characters that populate Miyazaki movies such as \u201cMy Neighbor Totoro\u201d or \u201cKiki's Delivery Service.\u201d",
      "\u201cI really fell in love with the result,\u201d said Lingeswaran, an entrepreneur who lives near Aachen, Germany. \u201cWe're thinking of printing it out and hanging it on the wall.\u201d",
      "Similar results gave the Ghibli style to iconic images, such as the casual look of Turkish pistol shooter Yusuf Dikec in a T-shirt and one hand in his pocket on his way to winning a silver medal at the 2024 Olympics. Or the famed \u201cDisaster Girl\u201d meme of a 4-year-old turning to the camera with a slight smile as a house fire rages in the background.",
      "ChatGPT maker OpenAI, which is fighting copyright lawsuits over its flagship chatbot, has largely encouraged the \u201cGhiblification\u201d experiments and its CEO Sam Altman changed his profile on social media platform X into a Ghibli-style portrait. In a technical paper posted Tuesday, the company had said the new tool would be taking a \u201cconservative approach\u201d in the way it mimics the aesthetics of individual artists.",
      "\u201cWe added a refusal which triggers when a user attempts to generate an image in the style of a living artist,\u201d it said. But the company added in a statement that it \u201cpermits broader studio styles \u2014 which people have used to generate and share some truly delightful and inspired original fan creations.\u201d",
      "Studio Ghibli in Japan declined to comment Friday.",
      "As users posted their Ghibli-style images on social media, Miyazaki\u2019s previous comments on AI animation also began to resurface. When Miyazaki was shown an AI demo in 2016, he said he was \u201cutterly disgusted\u201d by the display, according to documentary footage of the interaction. The person demonstrating the animation, which showed a writhing body dragging itself by its head, explained that AI could \u201cpresent us grotesque movements that we humans can\u2019t imagine.\u201d It could be used for zombie movements, the person said.",
      "That prompted Miyazaki to tell a story.",
      "\u201cEvery morning, not in recent days, I see my friend who has a disability,\u201d Miyazaki said. \u201cIt\u2019s so hard for him just to do a high five; his arm with stiff muscle can\u2019t reach out to my hand. Now, thinking of him, I can\u2019t watch this stuff and find it interesting. Whoever creates this stuff has no idea what pain is.\u201d",
      "He said he would \u201cnever wish to incorporate this technology into my work at all.\u201d",
      "\u201cI strongly feel that this is an insult to life itself,\u201d he added.",
      "Josh Weigensberg, a partner at the law firm Pryor Cashman, said that one question the Ghibli-style AI art raises is whether the AI model was trained on Miyazaki or Studio Ghibli\u2019s work. That in turn \u201craises the question of, \u2018Well, do they have a license or permission to do that training or not?\u2019\u201d he said.",
      "OpenAI didn\u2019t respond to a question Thursday about whether it had a license.",
      "Weigensberg added that if a work was licensed for training, it might make sense for a company to permit this type of use. But if this type of use is happening without consent and compensation, he said, it could be \u201cproblematic.\u201d",
      "Weigensberg said that there is a general principle \u201cat the 30,000-foot view\u201d that \u201cstyle\u201d is not copyrightable. But sometimes, he said, what people are actually thinking of when they say \u201cstyle\u201d could be \"more specific, discernible, discrete elements of a work of art,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cA \u2018Howl\u2019s Moving Castle' or \u2018Spirited Away,\u2019 you could freeze a frame in any of those films and point to specific things, and then look at the output of generative AI and see identical elements or substantially similar elements in that output,\u201d he said. \u201cJust stopping at, \u2018Oh, well, style isn\u2019t protectable under copyright law.\u2019 That's not necessarily the end of the inquiry.\u201d",
      "Artist Karla Ortiz, who grew up watching Miyazaki\u2019s movies and is suing other AI image generators for copyright infringement in a case that\u2019s still pending, called it \u201canother clear example of how companies like OpenAI just do not care about the work of artists and the livelihoods of artists.\u201d",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s using Ghibli\u2019s branding, their name, their work, their reputation, to promote (OpenAI) products,\u201d Ortiz said. \u201cIt\u2019s an insult. It\u2019s exploitation.\u201d",
      "Ortiz was further enraged when President Donald Trump\u2019s administration jumped into the meme trend Thursday, using the White House\u2019s official X account to post a Ghibli-style image of a weeping woman from the Dominican Republic recently arrested by U.S. immigration agents. The White House and OpenAI didn\u2019t immediately respond to requests for comment on how the image was made.",
      "\u201cTo see something so brilliant, as wonderful as Miyazaki\u2019s work be butchered to generate something so foul,\u201d Ortiz wrote on social media, adding that she hoped Studio Ghibli sues \u201cthe hell out of\u201d OpenAI for this.",

      "So when the International Skating Union put in motion its ambitious \u201cVision 2030\u201d plan, which is designed to grow and expand the sport through improved fan engagement, it made sense that they would call Wagner, a three-time U.S. champion and former world silver medalist, and Agosto, who won an Olympic silver medal with ice dance partner Tanith Belbin.",

      "\u201cThere's much more to come. I mean, we can brainstorm here a lot about potential marketing and sponsorship activations as well,\u201d said Wieland L\u00fcders, who manages the world championships for the ISU. \u201cEach skater has their own partners, potentially, so there are many more thoughts. But for now, we are just at the beginning. This is the basic concept.\u201d",
      "In the future, the Vision 2030 plan hopes to improve the TV presentation, simplify the sport\u2019s complex rules, increase sponsorship and expand revenue streams. It will also promote skating through grassroots initiatives, reimagine the season-long calendar, and explore new technology that could help to usher the sport into the modern era.",
      "The athletes aren't just benefiting from increased exposure, and the potential boon for their pocketbooks, but also from back-of-the-house upgrades that are a part of Vision 2030. In Boston, an expansive lounge is off limits to everyone but competitors, and back at their hotel, there is a calming room complete with a rotating cast of therapy dogs.",
      "Kim visited it this week. Nobody paid any attention to the ISU president because everybody wanted to see Penny, the dog.",
      "If the calming room is meant to destress, the new hot seat in the arena will probably do the exact opposite.",
      "Much like the time trial in Olympic cycling, where the leader sits uncomfortably on a throne until someone else takes the lead, the ISU has created the same thing at the world championships. But rather than some roped-off backstage area, where leaders have waited for decades, the hot seat is right next to the kiss-and-cry area in the heart of the arena.",
      "The athletes who are coming off the ice after their performance can't help but stare down whomever is in the lead.",
      "\u201cWe want the fans to see how that person is reacting when he or she climbs over to take the throne, or how they are reacting when they cannot make it,\u201d L\u00fcders said. \u201cThey could have interactions with each other, some hugging or high-fives, something like this. So we hope we get more engagement between the two skaters.\u201d",
      "Ultimately, more engagement with the fans, too.",

      "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- The United States has given an initial approval for the energy-rich Mideast nation of Qatar to buy eight armed MQ-9B Predator drones for its military, an estimated purchase worth nearly $2 billion.",
      "The State Department approval announced early Thursday for Qatar comes after Doha had been trying to purchase the drones during the Biden administration, but hadn't gotten the OK despite serving as an interlocutor for Washington to the Taliban in Afghanistan, Iran's theocracy and Hamas in the Gaza Strip. The immediate approval under President Donald Trump serves as a far-different starting point for his government's relations with Qatar \u2014 particularly after he initially backed a four-nation boycott of Doha during his first term.",
      "\u201cThis proposed sale will support the foreign policy and national security objectives of the United States by helping to improve the security of a friendly country that continues to be an important force for political stability and economic progress in the Middle East,\u201d the U.S. Defense Security Cooperation Agency said in a statement.",
      "Qatar's government did not immediately respond to a request for comment Thursday. Qatar is the second-largest purchaser of U.S. military equipment after Saudi Arabia, spending over $26 billion for F-15 fighter jets, Apache attack helicopters, missile defense systems and other gear.",
      "The proposed sale now goes to the U.S. Congress. Lawmakers typically weigh in on such sales and, in some cases, can block them.",
      "Under terms of the sale, Qatar would purchase eight of the drones, as well as hundreds of bombs and missiles to arm the pilotless aircraft with and the equipment necessary to fly them by satellite.",
      "General Atomics Reapers, which cost around $30 million apiece, can fly at altitudes over 40,000 feet (12,100 meters) and have an endurance of more than 30 hours before needing to land. The aircraft have been flown by both the U.S. military and the CIA over the Middle East for years, in Afghanistan, Iraq and now over Yemen during the American bombing campaign there. The drone has a land and sea version.",
      "The initial approval for Qatar, however, comes after the nearby United Arab Emirates has been waiting since 2020 to purchase up to 18 MQ-9 drones as part of a $23 billion deal also including advanced F-35 fighter jets. Trump has a particularly close relationship with the UAE, which reached a diplomatic recognition deal with Israel under his administration in 2020.",

      "A Chinese patient is the third person in world known to be living with a gene-edited pig kidney. And the same research team also reported an experiment implanting a pig liver into a brain-dead person.",
      "Scientists are genetically altering pigs so their organs are more humanlike in hopes of alleviating a transplant shortage. Two initial xenotransplants in the U.S. \u2014 two pig hearts and two pig kidneys \u2013 were short-lived. But two additional pig kidney recipients so far are thriving \u2013 an Alabama woman transplanted in November and a New Hampshire man transplanted in January. A U.S. clinical trial is about to begin.",
      "Nearly three weeks after the kidney surgery the Chinese patient \"is very well\u201d and the pig kidney likewise is functioning very well, Dr. Lin Wang of Xijing Hospital of the Fourth Military Medical University in Xi\u2019an told reporters in a briefing this week.",
      "Wang, part of the hospital's xenotransplant team, said the kidney recipient remains in the hospital for testing. Chinese media have reported she is a 69-year-old woman diagnosed with kidney failure eight years ago.",
      "But Wang pointed to a potential next step in xenotransplantation \u2014 learning to transplant pig livers. His team reported Wednesday in the journal Nature that a pig liver transplanted into a brain-dead person survived for 10 days, with no early signs of rejection. He said the pig liver produced bile and albumin \u2014 important for basic organ function \u2014 although not as much as human livers do.",
      "The liver is a complex challenge because of its varied jobs, including removing waste, breaking down nutrients and medicines, fighting infection, storing iron and regulating blood clotting.",
      "\u201cWe do find that it could function a little bit in a human being,\u201d Wang said. He speculated that would be enough to help support a failing human liver.",
      "In the U.S. last year, surgeons at the University of Pennsylvania attempted that sort of \u201cbridge\u201d support by externally attaching a pig liver to a brain-dead human body to filter blood, much like dialysis for failing kidneys. U.S. pig developer eGenesis is studying that approach.",
      "In China, Wang\u2019s team didn\u2019t remove the deceased person\u2019s own liver, instead implanting the pig liver near it.",
      "That \u201cclouds the picture,\u201d said Dr. Parsia Vagefi, a liver transplant surgeon at UT Southwestern Medical Center who wasn't involved with the work. \u201cIt\u2019s hopefully a first step but it\u2019s still, a lot like any good research, more questions than answers.\u201d",
      "Wang said his team later replaced the human liver of another brain-dead person with a pig liver and is analyzing the outcome.",
      "According to media reports, another Chinese hospital last year transplanted a pig liver into a living patient after a piece of his own cancerous liver was removed but it\u2019s unclear how that experiment turned out.",

      "Businesses and lawmakers are trying to address the U.S. affordable housing crisis by turning to alternative ways to build homes",
      "DENVER -- As Americans struggle under backbreaking rental prices, builders are turning to innovative ways to churn out more housing, from 3D printing to assembling homes in an indoor factory to using hemp \u2014 yes, the marijuana cousin \u2014 to make building blocks for walls.",
      "It's a response to the country's shortfall of millions of homes that has led to skyrocketing prices, plunging millions into poverty.",
      "\"There\u2019s not enough homes to purchase and there\u2019s not enough places to rent. Period,\" said Adrianne Todman, the acting secretary of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development under former President Joe Biden.",
      "One way to quickly build more is embrace these types of innovations, Todman said. \u201cI can only imagine what our housing situation would be like now if we could have made a decision to be more aggressive in adopting this type of housing.\"",
      "So what are these new ways of building homes? And can they help reduce the cost of new housing, leading to lower rents?",
      "In a cavernous, metal hall, Eric Schaefer stood in front of a long row of modular homes that moved through the plant, similar to a car on an assembly line.",
      "At a series of stations, workers lay flooring, erected framing, added roofs and screwed on drywall. Everything from electrical wiring to plumbing to kitchen countertops were in place before the homes were shrink-wrapped and ready to be shipped.",
      "The business in the Colorado Rocky Mountains, Fading West, has pumped out more than 500 homes in its just over three years of operation, each taking just five to seven days to build, even in the coldest winter months, Schaefer said.",
      "Once assembled in the plant, the narrow townhouse-style homes with white trim, balconies and front porches, are about 90% done. At their final destination they are move-in ready within six weeks, Schaefer said.",
      "The company works with towns, counties and housing nonprofits to help address the shortage of affordable homes, mostly for workers who've been squeezed out by sky-high prices in ritzy mountain towns.",
      "That includes Eagle, Colorado, not far from the Vail ski resort, where Fading West worked with Habitat for Humanity to install modular homes at affordable rents for teachers and other school district employees. The homes tend to be on the smaller side, but can be multifamily or single family.",
      "\u201cYou can build faster. The faster you build \u2014 even at a high quality \u2014 means the lower the price,\u201d Schaefer said. \u201cWe see this as one of the pieces to the puzzle in helping solve the affordable housing crisis.\"",
      "There's a hefty upfront cost to build the factory, and part of the challenge is a lack of state and federal investment, he said. A patchwork of building codes governing how a structure can be built also makes it difficult, requiring changes to the construction depending on the town or county it is being sent to.",
      "Manufactured housing is similar to modular housing, but the units are constructed on a chassis \u2014 like a trailer \u2014 and they aren't subject to the same local building codes. That's part of the reason they are used more broadly across the U.S.",
      "Roughly 100,000 manufactured homes were shipped to states in 2024, up from some 60,000 a decade earlier, according to Census Bureau data. Estimates of modular homes built annually often put them below 20,000.",
      "Yes, there's technology to 3D print homes.",
      "A computer-controlled robotic arm equipped with a hose and nozzle moves back and forth, oozing lines of concrete, one on top of the other, as it builds up the wall of a home. It can go relatively quickly and form curved walls unlike concrete blocks.",
      "Grant Hamel, CEO and co-founder of VeroTouch, stood inside one of the homes his company built, the wall behind him made out of rolling layers of concrete, distinct to a 3D printer. The technology could eventually reduce labor costs and the time it takes to build an abode, but is farther off than manufactured or modular methods from making a dent in the housing crisis.",
      "It's \u201ca long game, to start chipping away at those prices at every step of the construction process,\u201d Hamel said.",
      "The 3D printers are expensive, and so are the engineers and other skilled employees needed to run them, said Ali Memari, director of the Pennsylvania Housing Research Center, whose work has partly focused on 3D printing. It's also not recognized by international building codes, which puts up more red tape.",
      "The technology is also generally restricted to single-story structures, unless traditional building methods are used as well, Memari said",
      "It's \u201ca technology at its beginning, it has room to grow, especially when it is recognized in code,\u201d Memari said. \u201cThe challenges that I mentioned exist, and they have to be addressed by the research community.\u201d",
      "Hemp \u2014 the plant related to marijuana \u2014 is being used more and more in the construction of walls.",
      "The hemp is mixed with other materials, most importantly the mineral lime, forming \"hempcrete,\" a natural insulation that's mold- and fire-resistant and can act as outer wall, insulation and inner wall.",
      "Hempcrete still requires wood studs to frame the walls, but it replaces three wall-building components with just one, said Memari, also a professor at Penn State University's Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering. Memari is now helping oversee research into making hempcrete that doesn't need the wood studs.",
      "As much as a million hemp plants to be used for hempcrete can grow on one acre in a matter of months as opposed to trees, which can take years or decades to grow.",
      "The plant is part of the cannabis family but has far less of the psychoactive component, THC, found in marijuana. In 2018, Congress legalized the production of certain types of hemp. Last year, the International Code Council, which develops international building codes used by all 50 states, adopted hempcrete as an insulation.",
      "Confusion over the legality of growing hemp and the price tag of the machine required to process the plant, called a decorticator, are barriers to hempcrete becoming more widespread in housing construction, Memari said.",
      "Still, he said, \u201chempcrete has a bright future.\"",

      "It names a number of defendants, including the Executive Office of the President, the Attorney General Pam Bondi and the Department of Justice, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and the Department of Defense, as well as the United States Election Assistance Commission and its commissioners -- an independent government commissioner focused on election administration.",
      "Trump's executive order, signed last week, alleged that the United States \"fails to enforce basic and necessary election protections.\" The order instructs the Department of Justice to prosecute elections crimes in states the administration deems are not in compliance with federal law, requires the Department of Homeland Security to work with Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency to review state voter registration lists, and directs the Election Assistance Commission to withhold federal funding if states do not institute \"uniform and nondiscriminatory\" standards for counting votes.",

      "Specifically, the executive order calls for proof of citizenship nationwide on the form used when registering to vote -- a change from current election laws and a provision voting rights experts have taken issue with. Documents that can be used for proof, according to the order, include a passport, Real ID, a military ID card, or a valid federal or state ID.",
      "But the lawsuit points out that the order does not accept identification documents issued by Tribal governments or birth certificates as forms of proof. The suit also raises questions about the approved methods, arguing that only half of Americans possess a passport and \"most\" Real IDs do not indicate citizenship.",
      "Regardless, the lawsuit suggests the order's direction to the Election Assistance Commission to change the form to add the proof of citizenship requirement could violate the Voter Registration Act of 1993, which according to the lawsuit gives the EAC \"exclusive authority\" to administer the form.",
      "\"In keeping with the NVRA's intent to create a simple and easy-to-complete registration form, the NVRA specifies that the Federal Form may not \"include any requirement for notarization or other formal authentication,\" the lawsuit states.",
      "Trump's order suggested that noncitizens can easily vote in federal elections, but experts have called noncitizen voting a \"vanishingly rare phenomenon\" that is easily prosecuted. According to a study of over 23 million votes cast in the 2016 election, officials identified only 30 suspected incidents of noncitizen voting, only 0.0001% of the total votes cast.",
      "Separately, the executive order also takes aim at mail-in voting, making federal funding conditional on states setting a deadline for ballots to be received by Election Day. Trump -- who was charged with multiple federal crimes for his effort to overturn the 2020 election in cases that were dropped once he was elected -- has repeatedly suggested that mail-in ballots have led to an increase in voting fraud.",
      "The lawsuit claims the provision about mail-in ballots is unlawful, arguing that \"states have wide discretion and flexibility\" to establish the time, place, and manner of federal elections under the Elections and Electors Clauses in the Constitution.",
      "\"Congress can enact election laws if it chooses, but absent a conflict with federal law, States have the power to establish and follow their own election laws,\" the lawsuit states.",
      "According to the suit, seventeen states, plus Washington D.C., Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands, have laws that allow ballots to be counted as long as they are mailed by Election Day and received by a certain deadline afterward.",
      "\"Many of these States have had such receipt deadlines for many years, and Congress has declined to pass any laws dictating ballot receipt deadlines,\" the lawsuit says.",
      "The lawsuit notes that Congress has \"long established\" that the federal Election Day is the first Tuesday in November, in addition to establishing the date that presidential electors must be appointed, but \"has left further regulation in this area largely up to States.\" The lawsuit says the U.S. Supreme Court \"has said that while votes must be cast by Election Day, some aspects of the election process, such as tabulating all votes, will naturally take place after Election Day.\"",
      "\"The Attorney General does not have the authority to 'enforce' the federal Election Day statutes, and the President cannot order her to do so. Nor does a State \"violate\" those statutes when it counts validly cast ballots mailed by Election Day that are received after Election Day if State law so allows,\" the lawsuit states.",
      "The lawsuit also suggests the executive order could make it harder for citizens abroad and those serving in the military to vote. The executive order signed by Trump directs to secretary of defense to update the form used by these groups to register and request an absentee ballot -- called the \"Federal Post Card Application\" -- to include a requirement of documentary proof of citizenship as well as \"proof of eligibility to vote in elections in the State in which the voter is attempting to vote.\"",
      "The lawsuit notes this form is required by law as part of the the The Uniformed And Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act, passed in 1986 to \"protect the voting rights of Americans serving in the military, their families, and other U.S. citizens living abroad.\" The suit claims the changes required by the order would be \"impossible given the format required by Congress.\"",
      "\"Neither the President nor the Secretary of Defense has any legal authority to disregard UOCAVA's statutory requirement to make such a post card available to military and overseas voters,\" the lawsuit states.",
      "Together, these provisions would have a \"significant impact\" on voting rights., the lawsuit claims.",
      "Members of LULAC -- a Hispanic and Latin American civil rights organization -- for example, would be harmed if some of its members \"who are eligible to vote often do not have the requisite citizenship documents.\" the lawsuit states. The organization expects that efforts to register voters \"will plummet.\"",
      "The Arizona Students' Association will similarly be harmed by the proof of citizenship requirement, the lawsuit states, despite it being required when voters register on the state form there.",
      "\"Even those members who are able to register face imminent harm. Some members will be able to obtain or access DPOC only by spending significant time, money, and/or effort to do so, and will face greater difficulty registering because of the DPOC Requirement,\" the lawsuit said.",

    "story": [
      "Education Secretary McMahon accused Harvard of failing to protect students.",
      "The Department of Education and other agencies are reviewing Harvard University for fostering antisemitism on its campus, Secretary Linda McMahon said Monday.",
      "\"Harvard's failure to protect students on campus from anti-Semitic discrimination -- all while promoting divisive ideologies over free inquiry -- has put its reputation in serious jeopardy,\" McMahon said in a release.",
      "\"Harvard can right these wrongs and restore itself to a campus dedicated to academic excellence and truth-seeking, where all students feel safe on its campus,\" she said.",
      "The Education Department, the Department of Health and Human Services and the General Services Administration are joining in the comprehensive review of the school.",
      "The move comes as the administration's joint task force doubles down on removing antisemitic conduct and harassment from elite universities. The administration stripped Columbia University of $400 million in grants earlier this month after a task force investigation found inaction by the school to protect Jewish students.",
      "Monday's actions against Harvard come after a similar review led to Columbia agreeing to comply with nine preconditions for further negotiations regarding a return of canceled federal funds, according to the release.",
      "The task force will review hundreds of millions of dollars in grants to Harvard and its affiliates, according to the release.",
      "The agencies will also review another nearly $9 billion in grants to Harvard to ensure it's in compliance with \"federal regulations\" and \"civil rights responsibilities,\" the release said.",
      "In response to the review, Harvard President Alan Garber released a statement saying, \"We fully embrace the important goal of combatting antisemitism, one of the most insidious forms of bigotry.\"",
      "\"It is present on our campus,\" Garber continued, \"I have experienced antisemitism directly, even while serving as president, and I know how damaging it can be to a student who has come to learn and make friends at a college or university.\"",
      "Garber said, however, that the $9 billion in federal funding that is \"at stake\" as the university works to combat antisemitism could halt \"life-saving research and imperil important scientific research and innovation.\"",
      "\"As an institution and as a community, we acknowledge our shortcomings, pursue needed change, and build stronger bonds that enable all to thrive,\" Garber added.",
      "Harvard alum Rep. Kevin Kiley, R-Calif., told ABC News he believes too many universities have gone unchecked for tent encampments and hostile demonstrations that involved students overtaking buildings on campus in response to the Israel-Hamas conflict that broke out after Hamas launched a surprise attack on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023.",
      "Kiley, who sits on the House Education and Workforce Committee, called the administration's review \"incredibly refreshing\" and a proactive solution to protect the civil rights and safety of Harvard's Jewish students.",
      "\"We need to make sure that the rules are enforced, that civil rights laws are abided by and that there are consequences for illegal activity,\" Kiley said.",
      "Oregon Democratic Rep. Suzanne Bonamici is also a member of the Education and Workforce Committee and alongside Rep. Kiley, Bonamici serves on the subcommittee on higher education.",
      "Bonamici told ABC News she believes the administration has been pushing a concerning attack on institutions of higher education.",
      "She said threatening federal funding is a bridge too far. \"There are ways to address anti-Semitism that don't involve this type of threat,\" Bonamici said, adding, \"What they're trying to do is intimidate these universities, like they're doing with law firms, intimidate them into taking positions that are antithetical to higher education and free thought and critical thinking, so it's extremely concerning.\"",
      "Protests erupted on college campuses around the country after civilian casualties mounted in Gaza as Israel launched a military campaign in response to Oct. 7, vowing to eradicate Hamas -- which the U.S. has designated a terrorist organization.",
      "The federal reposonse comes after President Donald Trump signed an executive order directing McMahon to abolish the Department of Education and another order that takes measures to \"vigorously\" combat antisemitism.",
      "The Harvard review also highlights the administration's promise to ensure colleges would suffer the federal consequences if they foster antisemitic protests and demonstrations in the wake of Oct. 7.",
      "On the campaign trail, Trump said \"my promise to Jewish Americans is this: With your vote, I will be your defender, your protector, and I will be the best friend Jewish Americans have ever had in the White House.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Congress is investigating Harvard and nearly a dozen other schools for allegedly fostering antisemitism on campus.",
      "A House Education and Workforce Committee report last fall found many universities have failed to adequately discipline antisemitic conduct. A summary of the more than 100-page report alleges the \"overwhelming majority\" of students accused of antisemitic harassment or other acts of antisemitism on campuses faced minimal disciplinary action for their alleged violations.",

      "President Donald Trump has granted clemency to a pair of Hunter Biden's former business partners, both of whom accused former President Joe Biden's son of improperly leveraging his father's political power to broker overseas business relationships.",
      "Last Tuesday, Trump issued a full pardon to Devon Archer, who was sentenced to more than a year in prison for defrauding a Native American tribal entity in 2022.",
      "Later in the week, Trump commuted the 189-month sentence of Jason Galanis for his role in multiple fraudulent schemes.",
      "Archer and Galanis charted a similar path to their presidential pardons: Both men brokered business ties with Hunter Biden, were later found guilty of unrelated fraud schemes, pleaded with the Biden administration for executive clemency, and, when rebuffed, publicly accused Hunter Biden of improperly trading on his family name to secure overseas business deals.",
      "Galanis went a step further than Archer by retaining a high-powered Washington lawyer with close ties to the Trump political machine: Mark Paoletta, whom Trump recently tapped for general counsel at the White House Office of Management and Budget.",
      "Paoletta did not respond to a request for comment regarding Galanis' commutation.",
      "Last year, Galanis testified before the House Oversight Committee about the Biden family's business arrangements from a jail cell in Alabama. He asserted that Joe Biden was more engaged in Hunter Biden's business dealings than the former president publicly let on, and that \"the entire value add of Hunter Biden to our business was his family name and his access to his father, Vice President Joe Biden.\"",

      "Trump is set to unveil tariffs on April 2, which he has dubbed \"liberation day.\"",
      "U.S. stocks seesawed between gains and losses on Monday in the lead up to a promised fresh round of President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs on April 2, which he has dubbed \u201cliberation day.\u201d",
      "The market rollercoaster came a day after Goldman Sachs raised its odds of a recession within the next year from 20% to 35%, citing the tariffs. The move marked the latest in an upsurge of recession fears on Wall Street in recent weeks.",
      "A policy of wide-ranging levies on foreign goods could tip the U.S. into a recession, experts said. They pointed to risks of a slowdown for businesses mired in higher tax costs, as well as a shopping slump as consumers curtail spending to pad their savings to help weather price increases and a possible economic downturn.",
      "The degree and duration of Trump\u2019s forthcoming tariffs remains unknown, experts added, but they pointed to such uncertainty as another reason the economy could fall into a recession.",
      "\u201cIf both businesses and consumers start to worry and pull back their spending, that is what can tip the U.S. over into a recession,\u201d Kara Reynolds, an economist at American University, told ABC News.",
      "Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody\u2019s Analytics, described potential tariffs on April 2 as \u201cthe fodder for an economic downturn.\u201d",
      "Trump has already announced a flurry of duties, including sector-specific tariffs targeting autos, steel and aluminum. The U.S. has also imposed levies on some goods from Mexico, Canada and China.",
      "Over the weekend, Trump told reporters that the next round of tariffs could affect \u201call the countries.\u201d",
      "\"The tariffs will be far more generous than those countries were to us, meaning they will be kinder than those countries were to the United States of America,\" he said.",
      "The Trump administration has largely declined to rule out the possibility of a recession. Speaking at the White House earlier this month, Trump said a \"little disturbance\" may prove necessary to rejuvenate domestic production and reestablish well-paying manufacturing jobs.",
      "Experts generally define a recession by the shorthand metric of two consecutive quarters of decline in a nation\u2019s inflation-adjusted gross domestic product, or GDP.",
      "Tariffs could threaten economic growth and employment since duties slapped on imports risk increasing costs for businesses that rely on raw materials from abroad, some experts told ABC News.",
      "Experts widely expect importers to pass along a share of the tariff burden to consumers in the form of higher prices, which could make the firms less competitive as they may struggle to retain customers who suffer sticker shock.",
      "If business performance suffers, firms will likely freeze or reduce investment, threatening economic growth.",
      "\u201cAs business investment goes down, that can trigger a recession,\u201d Anne Villamil, a professor of economics at the University of Iowa, told ABC News.",
      "Even the looming risk of tariffs can make shoppers uneasy, potentially sinking the economy further, experts said.",
      "Consumer spending accounts for about two-thirds of U.S. economic activity. In March, consumer confidence dropped to its lowest level since 2021, according to a survey conducted by The Conference Board.",

      "Villamil, of the University of Iowa, acknowledged the strength of the economy in recent months. Still, she added, tariffs could plunge the U.S. into a downturn.",

      "A lawsuit aimed to stop Elon Musk and America PAC giving millions away Sunday.",
      "Just hours after the state Supreme Court rejected Wisconsin Attorney General Josh Kaul's effort to block Elon Musk from handing out $1 million checks on Sunday night, the billionaire took the stage at a town hall in Green Bay and gave away two $1 million checks to attendees in his latest effort to support conservative candidate Brad Schimel.",
      "Urging the crowd to back Schimel, Musk cast Tuesday as \"a vote for which party controls the House of Representatives\" and implied \"the future of civilization\" is at stake.",
      "One of the recipients of a large, showy check, Nicholas Jacobs, is the chair of the Wisconsin College Republicans.",
      "The Wisconsin Supreme Court's order came just minutes before the event was set to start.",
      "Notably, the court also rejected a bid from Musk's lawyers to ask two justices, who had campaigned for Wisconsin Supreme Court candidate Susan Crawford, to recuse themselves.",
      "The ruling came after an appeals court on Saturday denied Kaul's emergency motion to stop the giveaway from taking place.",
      "Kaul wrote in his initial filing on Friday that he was asking for emergency relief to stop Musk and America PAC \"from further promoting a million-dollar giveaway to attendees of a planned event on Sunday, March 30, 2025, and prohibiting Respondents from making any payments to Wisconsin electors to vote.\"",
      "However, the judge assigned to the case, the Honorable Columbia County Circuit Court Judge W. Andrew Voigt, refused to hear the lawsuit before Sunday's Green Bay rally with Musk -- prompting Kaul's emergency motion asking a Court of Appeals to take action.",
      "After that emergency motion was rejected, Kaul appealed to the Wisconsin Supreme Court to step in on Sunday.",
      "Lawyers for Elon Musk and America PAC then filed motions for the recusal of Wisconsin Supreme Court Justices Rebecca Frank Dallet and Jill J. Karofsky.",
      "They argued that because Dallet and Karofsky campaigned for Crawford, and Crawford has been critical of Musk, \"to avoid any potential perceptions of bias and manifestations of possible bias, Justices Dallet and Karofsky should decline to participate in consideration of this matter.\"",
      "The lawyers also framed the planned Sunday night giveaways as \"spokesperson agreements\" for spokespeople for the PAC.",
      "In the initial lawsuit, shared by Kaul's office, Kaul argued that \"Musk's announcement of his intention to pay $1 million to two Wisconsin electors who attend his event on Sunday night, specifically conditioned on their having voted in the upcoming April 3, 2025, Wisconsin Supreme Court election, is a blatant attempt to violate\" state law, which \"forbids anyone from offering or promising to give anything of value to an elector in order to induce the elector to go to the polls, vote or refrain from voting, or vote for a particular person.\"",
      "The suit asked for a restraining order \"prohibiting Defendants from any further promotion of the million-dollar gifts to attendees of the planned Sunday March 30, 2025,\" as well as a temporary restraining order \"prohibiting Defendants from making any payments to Wisconsin electors to vote,\" and injunctive relief to \"restrain and prohibit all actions by Defendants taken in furtherance of a planned violation\" of the state law.",
      "In addition to presenting the checks on Sunday night, Musk said his PAC is launching a \"Block Captain\" program ahead of the election on Tuesday, where participants will make $20 for each picture they post of someone with a Schimel sign and a thumbs up outside of their home.",
      "So far, two political groups aligned with Musk -- America PAC and Building America's Future -- have poured nearly $20 million into supporting Schimel for the open seat.",
      "The world's richest man has used cash giveaways in the past, including a controversial $1 million sweepstakes offered to voters in swing states during last year's election cycle as part of an effort to boost President Donald Trump's chances of winning in those states.",
      "The Wisconsin Supreme Court election, on Tuesday, has generally become the center of a political firestorm, and has become the most expensive state supreme court race in American history, according to the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University.",

And more importantly, I think that when you have a team captain, you have to support the team,\" Fine said.",
      "Fine's race is one of a pair of special elections for the U.S. House in Florida on Tuesday that might have an impact on the balance of power in the U.S. House of Representatives. House Republicans currently hold a narrow majority with 218 Republicans to 213 Democrats. Speaker Mike Johnson has a two-vote cushion for his majority.",
      "While the Republicans are favored to win in each district -- given that both districts were ruby-red in 2024 -- some have speculated that the margin between the Republicans and Democrats in each district could be tighter than anticipated, and voices within the Republican Party have raised concerns over Fine's campaign. Fine and his allies, including Trump, have maintained he has momentum.",
      "Fine shrugged off some recent implicit criticism from Florida Gov. DeSantis, telling Macedo, \"What I'm focused on is tomorrow. We're doing great.\"",

      "ABC News Live reached out to Weil's campaign as well to request an interview.",
      "If elected, Fine will be dealing with issues such as the nation's economy. A recent Gallup poll showed that 59% of Americans disapprove of Trump's handling of it.",
      "Asked by Macedo if he thinks Trump has done enough on inflation, Fine said he does and emphasized how his race ties into Republicans advancing Trump's agenda.",
      "\"I think he's giving everything -- inflation and ... everything else a lot of attention,\" Fine said, blaming the Biden administration for a \"mess\" that Trump had to take on.",
      "Mentioning improvements in the price of eggs and fuel, Fine added, \"There's more work to be done, but I think he's doing a great job, and that's why it's important that people go vote for me, so that we can keep that Republican majority in Congress and continue to fight for President Trump's agenda.\"",
      "Asked if he'd support Trump's planned tariffs this week even if they raise prices, Fine said he doesn't know that they will raise prices and that he supports tariffs generally because \"the time for America being taken advantage of is over.\"",

      "\"Florida farmers are supporting me. The major agriculture entities in Florida are supporting me, and they're happy because they see foreign goods be dumped into the United States, subsidized by other countries. They have a difficult time selling their products abroad, and they are glad to see America standing up for fair trade practices,\" Fine said.",

    "story": [
      "Groups affiliated with Elon Musk have poured money into the race.",
      "Spending in the Wisconsin Supreme Court election, which had already set a record for the most expensive state supreme court race in American history, has passed $90 million as of Monday, according to a tally by the Brennan Center for Justice, a nonprofit law institute.",
      "That $90 million includes more than $40 million total spent by the liberal candidate, Dane County Judge Susan Crawford, and groups supporting her -- and almost $50 million total spent by the conservative candidate Waukesha County Judge Brad Schimel and groups supporting him.",
      "Groups affiliated with Elon Musk, President Donald Trump's closest adviser and the billionaire owner of Tesla, have spent almost $20 million in the race supporting Schimel. The Musk-affiliated America PAC has spent more than $12 million, while another group linked to him, Building America's Future, has spent almost $6 million.",
      "Musk has separately given $2 million to the Republican Party of Wisconsin, which is supporting Schimel.",
      "Musk has cast the race as \"a vote for which party controls the House of Representatives\" and has implied \"the future of civilization\" is at stake. On Sunday, the tech billionaire also controversially gave away two $1 million checks to attendees at a rally in his latest effort to support Schimel.",
      "Crawford has received significant support as well. Major liberal donors such as Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker and Democratic donor George Soros have given money to the Wisconsin Democratic Party, and the state party has donated around $2 million to Crawford.",
      "According to the Brennan Center's tally, Crawford's own campaign has spent more than $22 million; Schimel's has spent over $11 million.",
      "The nonprofit says that the previous record for spending in a state supreme court race was in Wisconsin's 2023 state supreme court election, when $56 million was spent.",
      "The high-profile election will be held on Tuesday and will help determine the ideological bent of the court, which currently leans liberal, ahead of potential cases on hot-button issues such as redistricting and abortion rights.",
      "\"Across the country, state supreme court elections have been getting more attention, and more money, as people increasingly realize that these courts are deciding some of the highest stakes legal fights today. But even with the growing attention on these races nationally, what is happening in Wisconsin is unlike anything any other state has seen,\" Douglas Keith, senior counsel in the Brennan Center's Judiciary Program told ABC News in an email.",
      "Keith said the $90 million spent on the Supreme Court race make it look more like a competitive race for the U.S. Senate \"than the relatively quiet judicial elections of just a few years ago.\"",
      "\"All of this spending, and the attack ads that come with it, make it much harder for the public to view judges as doing something different than raw politics, which is troubling at a time when it is just so important that the public can trust that courts are able to serve as a meaningful check on the political branches,\" Keith said.",
      "As of Monday, around 644,000 people in Wisconsin have voted early in person or by mail, according to the Wisconsin Elections Commission.",

    "story": [
      "Ongoing long-range strikes show Moscow has no interest in peace, Zelenskyy said.",
      "LONDON -- Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy called for further \"tough measures\" against Russia to push President Vladimir Putin into a ceasefire agreement, suggesting after another round of drone strikes that Moscow \"couldn't care less about diplomacy.\"",
      "Long-range cross-border strikes have continued throughout U.S.-mediated efforts to secure a ceasefire in Ukraine, intended as a springboard for a broader peace deal to end Russia's 3-year-old invasion of its neighbor.",
      "Both Kyiv and Moscow last week agreed to freeze attacks in the Black Sea and on energy infrastructure, though both have since accused the other of violating the pause on attacking energy targets.",
      "In a Sunday evening video address, Zelenskyy reported \"more strikes and shelling\" in seven Ukrainian regions. \"The geography and brutality of Russian strikes, not just occasionally, but literally every day and night, show that Putin couldn't care less about diplomacy,\" he said.",
      "\"For several weeks now, there has been a U.S. proposal for an unconditional ceasefire,\" Zelenskyy continued. \"And almost every day, in response to this proposal, there are Russian drones, bombs, artillery shelling and ballistic strikes.\"",
      "\"Russia deserves increased pressure -- all the tough measures that can break its capacity to wage war and sustain the system that wants nothing but war,\" Zelenskyy said. \"Sanctions against Russia are essential. More air defense for Ukraine is essential. More cooperation and unity among all partners is essential.\"",
      "President Donald Trump on Sunday hinted at his apparent frustration with the lack of progress toward a peace deal in Ukraine, telling NBC News he was \"very angry\" at Putin after the Russian leader again criticized Zelenskyy and called for his removal in favor of a transitional government.",
      "Trump added that he would consider applying new sanctions on Russia's lucrative oil exports and on any nations purchasing its oil. China and India are among the most significant customers for Russian oil products.",
      "The president later told reporters on Air Force One that his administration was making significant progress toward ending the war. Asked about his relationship with Putin, Trump responded, \"I don't think he's going to go back on his word.\"",
      "\"I've known him for a long time,\" Trump said. \"We've always gotten along well despite the Russia, Russia, Russia hoax.\"",
      "The president said he was \"disappointed\" by Putin's latest attacks on Zelenskyy. \"He considers him not credible, he's supposed to be making a deal with him, whether you like him or you don't like him, so I wasn't happy with that.\"",
      "Asked if there was a deadline for Russia to agree to a ceasefire, Trump suggested there was a \"psychological deadline.\" He added, \"If I think they're tapping us along, I will not be happy about it.\"",
      "On Monday, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Putin \"remains absolutely open to contacts with President Trump, so if necessary their conversation will be very promptly organized.\"",
      "\"Right now there is no phone conversation fixed in the schedule, but once again I repeat, President Putin remains open for such communication and if necessary such a conversation can be very promptly arranged,\" Peskov said.",
      "Russia and Ukraine continued cross-border strikes through Sunday night into Monday morning.",
      "Ukraine's air force said Russia launched two missiles and 131 drones into the country overnight, of which it said 57 drones were shot down and 45 lost in flight without causing damage. The Sumy, Donetsk, Kharkiv, Kyiv and Zhytomyr regions were affected by the attack, the air force said in a post to Telegram.",
      "Russia's Defense Ministry, meanwhile, said its forces shot down 66 Ukrainian drones overnight -- 41 over Bryansk region, 24 over Kaluga region and one over Kursk region.",

      "PHOENIX -- The Democratic base is angry.",
      "Not just at President Donald Trump, Elon Musk and the \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d movement. Rank-and-file Democrats are mad at their own leaders and increasingly agitating to replace them.",
      "Arizona Democrats pushed out their party chair, and Georgia Democrats are on their way to doing the same. And Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York postponed a book tour in the face of protests amid calls from progressives that he face a primary challenge.",
      "The losing party after a presidential election often spends time in the wilderness, but the visceral anger among Democrats toward their party leaders is reaching a level reminiscent of the tea party movement that swept out Republican incumbents 15 years ago.",
      "\u201cThey should absolutely be worried about holding onto power, because there's a real energy right now against them,\u201d Paco Fabi\u00e1n, deputy director of Our Revolution, a grassroots group allied with independent Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, said of Democratic incumbents. \u201cAnd as soon as somebody figures out how to harness it, they're going to be in deep trouble.\u201d",
      "Elections on Tuesday could give national Democrats a boost. In Wisconsin, the officially nonpartisan race for a state Supreme Court seat has become a test of Musk's influence as his political organization boosts conservative Brad Schimel and progressives back liberal Susan Crawford, who has made anti-Musk messaging a centerpiece of her campaign. And two U.S. House special elections in Florida feature Democrats who are outraising their Republican counterparts in sharply pro-Trump districts.",
      "But the current depth of frustration among Democrats is clear and shows no signs of going away.",
      "According to a February Quinnipiac poll, about half disapprove of how Democrats in Congress are handling their job, compared with about 4 in 10 who approve. That\u2019s a stark contrast from the beginning of Joe Biden\u2019s presidency in 2021, when more than 8 in 10 Democrats approved of how their party was doing its job in Congress, and the start of Trump\u2019s first term in 2017, when about 6 in 10 Democrats approved. In 2017, as they do now, Democrats lacked control of either congressional chamber.",
      "A February CNN/SSRS poll found about three-quarters of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents thought Democrats in Congress weren\u2019t doing enough to oppose Trump.",
      "Facing a coordinated and long-planned Republican effort to remake government and fire tens of thousands of federal workers, Democrats have struggled with a unified response.",
      "Frustration on the left with elected Democrats began early, when some Democratic senators backed Trump Cabinet nominees and supported legislation targeting illegal immigration. It escalated following Trump\u2019s joint address to Congress, when Democratic lawmakers protested by wearing coordinated clothes and holding up signs expressing their discontent. A handful of Democrats then voted with Republicans to censure U.S. Rep. Al Green, D-Texas, who interrupted Trump's speech to Congress and was escorted out of the chamber.",
      "Schumer faced the most serious backlash after he refused to block a Republican-led government spending bill and shut down the government. Schumer said blocking the bill would have backfired and played into Trump\u2019s hands, but many on the left saw it as capitulation.",
      "\u201cI want the opposition to be a lot more animated,\u201d said Stefan Therrien, a 22-year-old engineering student in Tempe, Arizona, who called Democratic leaders in Congress \u201cvery passive\u201d in a misguided effort to appeal to centrists. \u201cDemocrats should attack harder.\u201d",
      "Ken Human, a retired attorney who went to a town hall organized by Democrats in Lexington, Kentucky, said: \u201cYou have to stand up to bullies because otherwise they\u2019ll walk all over you.\u201d",
      "Anger from a party's base is not unusual after a party loses the presidency.",
      "Establishment Republicans faced fierce backlash after Democrat Barack Obama was elected president in 2008, which fueled the rise of the tea party movement that overthrew some of the party\u2019s most powerful incumbents and brought in a new cadre of lawmakers laser-focused on obstructing Obama\u2019s agenda.",
      "Democrats, likewise, were dejected after Republican President George W. Bush was reelected in 2004, but his popularity soon tanked and Democrats could foresee the massive wins they would notch in the 2006 midterms, said Robert Shapiro, a Columbia University professor focused on American politics.",
      "Ronald Reagan\u2019s victory in 1980 was a bigger shock to Democrats because it brought with it a period of Republican ascendance. The GOP won a Senate majority for the first time in nearly 30 years, though Democrats retained control of the House.",
      "\u201cThe setback was significant and startling, but not as much as what\u2019s happened today, where you have Trump winning the election at the same time the Republicans have control of both houses of Congress,\u201d Shapiro said.",
      "Grassroots Democrats were incensed by Trump\u2019s first victory \u2014 with some talk then of primary challengers to leaders \u2014 but they mostly channeled their anger toward the president and the GOP, planning marches and organizing community groups to prepare for the midterms.",
      "Those midterms led to at least one primary upset with future implications: New York Rep. Joe Crowley, the No. 4 House Democrat, fell to Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, then a virtual unknown.",
      "Thousands have packed rallies to hear Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez, outsiders who rose to prominence for their sharp criticism of the Democratic establishment.",
      "Democrats are getting an earful from constituents at some of the town halls, including events they\u2019re organizing in GOP-controlled districts to draw attention to Republicans avoiding unscripted interactions with voters.",
      "In Arizona, which went for Biden in 2020 before flipping to Trump last year, furious party leaders ousted their chair, Yolanda Bejarano. The result was a shock; Bejarano had support from every prominent Democrat in the state and was widely expected to get a second term.",
      "U.S. Rep. Nikema Williams, the chair of the Georgia Democratic Party, is in a similarly perilous position after Trump flipped Georgia in 2024. The Georgia party's state committee approved a rules change Saturday making its chairmanship a full-time role, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported. That will make it increasingly likely that Williams, keeping her congressional seat, will step down as chair before her term ends in 2027.",
      "Kat Abughazaleh, a 26-year-old liberal journalist with a big social media following, decided to run for Congress, saying most Democrats \u201cwork from an outdated playbook\u201d in an announcement video that\u2019s fiercely critical of party leaders.",
      "\u201cThey aren\u2019t meeting the moment, and their constituents are absolutely livid,\u201d Abughazaleh said in an interview. She said Rep. Jan Schakowsky, the 80-year-old Democrat who has represented a suburban Chicago district since 1999, has an \u201cadmirable\u201d progressive record, but \u201csomething needs to change culturally ... about how we do politics and how we campaign.\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019m done sitting around waiting for someone else to maybe do it,\u201d Abughazaleh said.",

      "Tariffs are expected to hike prices by thousands of dollars per vehicle.",
      "Auto tariffs set to take effect within days pose car buyers with a choice: Do they dash out to dealerships ahead of possible price increases totaling thousands of dollars?",
      "Experts who spoke to ABC News urged customers to seriously consider accelerating their purchase plans, though they cautioned buyers against skipping due diligence such as comparison shopping and researching borrower-friendly loans.",
      "It remains uncertain whether price increases will hit as soon as next week or within months when sellers run out of tariff-free inventory, some experts said, but they pointed to such uncertainty as reason to speed up a purchase.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019ll see a lot of people going to dealership lots sooner rather than later because they have no idea when or how much the tariffs will hit them in the wallet,\u201d Joseph McCabe, president and CEO of advisory firm AutoForecast Solutions, told ABC News.",
      "The 25% auto tariffs, set to take effect on April 3, will apply to imported passenger vehicles, including cars, SUVs, minivans, cargo vans and light trucks, according to a White House statement released after Trump's Oval Office remarks on Wednesday.",
      "Analysts widely expect the tariffs to raise prices for foreign-made cars, since importers will likely pass along a share of the tax burden to consumers.",
      "Cars produced in the U.S. are also expected to undergo significant price hikes since manufacturers will bear higher costs for imported parts and face an uptick in demand as buyers seek out domestic alternatives, experts previously told ABC News.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a really complex situation but the bottom line for consumers is that the price of cars will be going up,\u201d Kimberly Palmer, a personal finance expert at NerdWallet, told ABC News.",
      "\u201cIf you know you need to buy a car \u2013 it\u2019s something you\u2019ve already decided and worked into your budget \u2013 then it could make sense to speed up your timeline,\u201d Palmer added.",
      "Aaron Bragman, Detroit bureau chief at Cars.com, put it more succinctly: \u201cTry to get a vehicle now if you can.\u201d",
      "Dan Ives, managing director of equity research at the investment firm Wedbush, predicted general tariff-related price increases for U.S. buyers between $5,000 and $10,000 per vehicle.",
      "The added costs could reach as high as $20,000 per vehicle, Art Wheaton, director of labor studies at Cornell's School of Industrial and Labor Relations, who studies the auto industry, told ABC News in a statement.",
      "The scale and timing of price increases will likely vary depending on whether a model or its parts originates in the U.S., as well as a manufacturer\u2019s assessment of its customers\u2019 capacity to absorb higher costs, some experts said.",
      "A potential surge in demand over the coming days or weeks could also push up prices, adding to the urgency of customers on the sidelines and in turn pushing prices even higher, they added.",
      "\u201cIf everybody goes out to buy a car, the prices will certainly go up,\u201d Prasad Venkatesh, senior vice president of research and chief innovation officer at the Center for Automotive Research, told ABC News.",
      "The tariffs are also expected to raise prices for used cars, since higher prices for new cars will send many customers seeking pre-owned options, experts said.",
      "After the tariffs take effect, manufacturers may stop producing some low-priced models altogether, McCabe said, since some carmakers lack sufficient profit margins to absorb the tax cost.",
      "\u201cThe vehicles that are in the more affordable range \u2013 let\u2019s say below $30,000 \u2013 they will potentially be squeezed out of the market,\u201d McCabe said.",
      "The decision to hurry up a car purchase carries risk, however.",
      "High interest rates have pushed up borrowing rates for car loans, meaning customers entering the market may take on stiff monthly payments even if the sticker price is relatively low, some experts said.",
      "Typically, car buyers should run credit reports and address any potential errors as a means of pushing down loan rates, Palmer said, but that process usually lasts a matter of weeks. Comparison shopping can also deliver significant savings but a thorough search for offerings takes additional time.",
      "Auto tariffs will raise the price of car repairs and insurance, making it a costly time to own a car, Palmer said.",
      "\u201cBuying a car is such a big financial decision. It\u2019s expensive and it has a huge impact on your finances, so you don\u2019t want to rush if you\u2019re not ready,\u201d Palmer added.",

      "\u201cThis is not related to student protests,\" Tricia McLaughlin, assistant secretary at the Department of Homeland Security, said in a statement. \"The individual in question was arrested after a visa revocation by the State Dept. related to a prior criminal history for a DUI.\u201d",
      "News of the student's detention \u2014 and the lack of an official explanation \u2014 sparked student protests and expressions of concern from university and political leaders. Gov. Tim Walz told reporters Monday that he spoke with Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem about it Friday and was still waiting for further details.",
      "Meanwhile, officials at Minnesota State University Mankato said Monday that one of their students had been detained by ICE as well.",

      "Officers Justin McMillan and Justin Colon intentionally turned off their body cameras as they broke into a residential building, stole money and forcibly touched a woman while on duty last July, according to Queens District Attorney Melinda Katz.",
      "The patrol officers, who were still on probationary status after entering the police academy in 2023, had been responding to a report of prostitution inside the building.",
      "Prosecutors say the two shut off their bodycams before approaching a woman leaving the building and taking a key to the residence from her.",
      "They returned eight hours later, unlocked the door and found a woman having sex with a man, who immediately fled, according to Katz's office.",
      "McMillan then stole money from the woman's purse and groped her.",
      "The woman ran away and eventually called 911 with the help of others, prosecutors said. The officers, meanwhile, returned to their stationhouse without reporting the incidents.",
      "McMillan, 27, of Long Island, and Colon, 24, of Queens, pleaded not guilty during their arraignment hearings Monday in Queens. They were released and are due back in court April 28, according to Katz's office.",
      "They each face one count of forcible touching and petit larceny, two counts of burglary, and four counts of official misconduct.",
      "Lawyers for the two didn't immediately respond to messages seeking comment.",
      "The officers have been suspended without pay. They were placed on modified duty last August as the NYPD's internal affairs bureau and Katz's office investigated, according to police.",
      "\u201cWe hold our officers to the highest standard of professionalism and integrity, and failing to meet that standard is disqualifying,\" Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch said in a statement. \"Let me be perfectly clear: Any officer who violates their oath will be investigated, exposed, and held fully accountable. That standard will never change.\u201d",

      "Thomas Caldwell, a retired Navy intelligence officer, was tried alongside Oath Keepers founder Stewart Rhodes but acquitted of seditious conspiracy \u2014 the most serious charge brought in the Jan. 6 attack.",
      "Caldwell's pardon is dated March 20. Defense attorney David Fischer said he informed Caldwell of the pardon on Monday after learning about it from news reports.",
      "\u201cAnd he's elated,\u201d Fischer added.",
      "A jury convicted Caldwell of obstructing Congress and of obstructing justice for tampering with documents after the riot. One of those convictions was dismissed in light of a U.S. Supreme Court ruling last year.",
      "On Jan. 10, U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta sentenced Caldwell to time served with no supervised release. Prosecutors had recommended four years in prison for Caldwell.",
      "Ten days later, on his first day back in the White House, Trump issued a sweeping grant of clemency to all 1,500-plus people charged in the Capitol riot. Trump commuted the sentences of several defendants who were leaders and members of the Oath Keepers or Proud Boys extremist groups.",
      "More than a dozen defendants were convicted of seditious conspiracy for what prosecutors said were violent plots to keep Trump in power.",
      "Prosecutors had alleged at trial that Caldwell helped coordinate \u201cquick reaction force\u201d teams prosecutors said the Oath Keepers stationed outside the capital city to get weapons into the hands of extremists if they were needed. The weapons were never deployed, and lawyers for the Oath Keepers said they were only there for defensive purposes in case of attacks from left-wing activists.",
      "But Caldwell, who didn\u2019t enter the Capitol, took the witness stand and down played messages he sent leading up to Jan. 6, including one floating the idea about getting a boat to ferry \u201cheavy weapons\u201d across the Potomac River. Caldwell said he was never serious about it, calling it \u201ccreative writing.\u201d",
      "Fischer said his client was \u201cfirst among equals for a pardon.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhen a progressive D.C. jury acquits him of most of the charges and an Obama-appointed judge sentences him to basically time served and a fine, I think it\u2019s safe to say the government got it wrong,\u201d the attorney said.",

      "WASHINGTON -- An official allied with Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency has been put in charge of the U.S. Institute of Peace, a congressionally created and funded think tank targeted by President Donald Trump for closure, according to a federal court filing Monday.",
      "Two board members of the Institute of Peace have authorized replacing its temporary president with Nate Cavanaugh, the filing says. They ordered him, it says, to transfer the institute's property to the General Services Administration, the federal government's real estate manager, which is terminating hundreds of leases at DOGE's behest.",
      "The court filing asks U.S. District Judge Beryl Howell in Washington to stop the action or schedule a status conference to address the issues as soon as \u201cpracticable.\u201d",
      "The White House didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "The action follows a Friday night mass firing of nearly all of the institute's 300 employees. Former employees say only a small number did not get notification, including colleagues who are abroad, who were given until April 9 to return to the U.S., and the regional vice presidents, who direct the areas where they are based.",
      "Two former employees, who spoke to The Associated Press on the condition of anonymity for fear of retribution, said they were reached by private emails because they have been locked out of the institute's system and were not able to return to work since a tense standoff earlier this month in which DOGE members were accompanied by law enforcement. They were given until April 7 to clear out their personal effects.",
      "An executive order from the Republican president in February listed the institute, which seeks to prevent and resolve conflicts, and three other agencies for closure. Board members, who are nominated by the president and confirmed by the Senate, and the institute\u2019s president were fired. Later, there was a standoff between employees who blocked DOGE members from entering the institute\u2019s headquarters near the State Department. DOGE staff gained access in part with the help of the Washington police.",
      "Howell chastised DOGE representatives for their behavior but did not reinstate the board members or allow employees to return to the workspace.",
      "The court filing by plaintiffs acknowledges Howell's previous actions denying a temporary restraining order. \u201cThey seek relief now simply to preserve the status quo with regard to the Court's jurisdiction to grant relief if it determines that the removal of a vast majority of the Institute's directors was unlawful,\u201d it says.",

      "Six correctional officers were charged with murder last month in the December death of Robert Brooks, 43, whose brutal beating was captured on body-worn cameras. Three other prison employees were charged with manslaughter and another with evidence tampering.",
      "The offers were publicly revealed during a pretrial court conference by Onondaga County District Attorney William Fitzpatrick, who declined to provide details afterward. The individual defendants will appear in court in April to either accept or reject the offers.",
      "The prosecutor's offer to David Walters, charged with second-degree manslaughter, was to plead guilty to the existing charge with a recommendation for a mid-range sentence, his attorney Nick Passalacqua said.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve not been made an offer as I define it. We\u2019ve been asked to plead guilty to the charge,\u201d Passalacqua said, adding that he believed other defendants received similar offers.",
      "Other attorneys declined comment after court.",
      "Walters was due back in court April 30.",

      "LOS ANGELES -- There are brief moments when Annisa Faquir forgets that the Little Red Hen Coffee Shop, the Altadena diner her grandmother founded a half century ago, burned down in the Eaton Fire.",
      "\u201cYou think, \u2018I can go grab something \u2014 oh wait, it\u2019s in ashes,\u2019\u201d said Faquir, who has worked at the shop since her mother, Barbara Shay, took over the family business seven years ago.",
      "The women want to rebuild the diner loved by neighbors for its shrimp and grits, catfish, and Shay\u2019s secret house coffee blend. They knew they'd need help, but were surprised when Paris Hilton called to offer it to them.",
      "The Little Red Hen Coffee Shop is one of 50 women-owned businesses impacted by the Eaton Fire receiving a recovery grant of up to $25,000 from Hilton \u2019s nonprofit 11:11 Media Impact and GoFundMe.org.",
      "\u201cThese women are the backbone of their communities,\u201d the reality TV star said in a statement. \u201cThrough this powerful partnership, we\u2019re not just helping them rebuild \u2014 we\u2019re investing in their futures, their families, and their neighborhoods.\u201d",
      "Faquir said the significant grant and the ease of the process was helpful, especially compared to tougher questioning for smaller grants from other donors who asked \u201cfor an arm and a leg.\u201d \u201cThey saw us,\u201d she said. \u201cThey heard our story.\u201d",
      "More than 1,800 businesses were located in the Eaton and Palisades fire zones, according to Los Angeles County\u2019s Economic Development Corporation. They employed 9,600 workers and generated $1.4 billion in annual sales. The county estimates subsequent losses in economic output, income reductions, and tax revenue will be in the billions.",
      "\u201cMaking sure they stay afloat now is supercritical so that we can even talk to them about longterm recovery,\u201d Kelly LoBianco, director of L.A. County\u2019s Department of Economic Opportunity, said of those businesses.",
      "Businesses generally struggle to reopen after catastrophes. In 2023, three-quarters of small businesses were underinsured, according to the insurer Hiscox, and less than half had property insurance.",
      "In the L.A. fires, many business owners also lost their homes. Some are still repaying loans from the COVID-19 pandemic. The county is distributing about $20 million in emergency grants, but LoBianco said much more will be needed.",
      "After applications flooded in for its own program, 11:11 Media Impact and GoFundMe.org expanded it from 11 to 50 grants. The recipients include childcare centers, bakeries, bookshops, dance studios, and salons.",
      "\u201cSeeing the overwhelming response from women entrepreneurs in need of support showed us how important and urgent the need is to help this community rebuild,\u201d said Hilton.",
      "The money will boost entrepreneurs who worried the Eaton Fire had destroyed their futures, said Lizzy Okoro Davidson, director of the Pasadena Women\u2019s Business Center, which is partnering on the grant program. The money can help pay back-rent after long closures, secure new spaces, and replace equipment. \u201cIn some cases the $25,000 will be the bridge to get them to 100% of what they need,\u201d said Okoro Davidson.",
      "Renata Ortega, owner of Orla Floral Studio, used to run her floral design company out of a converted garage next to the home she shared with her husband and three dogs in the Altadena foothills.",
      "Since the Eaton fire destroyed their property, Ortega has been working from a shared workshop in downtown LA lent to her by a fellow floral designer. It was a kindness Ortega deeply appreciates, but she knows she'll eventually need her own space.",
      "\u201cI really didn\u2019t know if we were going to make it or how long we were going to make it, having to start from scratch, so this grant is really giving me hope right now at a time of uncertainty,\u201d she said.",
      "Ortega will use the money for a deposit and rent on a studio while she and her husband rebuild their property. She also needs to replace all the vases, shelving, and tools she lost.",
      "\u201cI can continue a business that was once just a dream for me,\u201d said Ortega, adding that she will be forever grateful to Hilton. \u201cNow we\u2019re going to make it.\u201d",
      "The Pasadena Women\u2019s Business Center will also receive $25,000 to provide no-cost advising to local business owners. Okoro Davidson said entrepreneurs will need lots of encouragement to keep going.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re really at the beginning of the beginning of the rebuild process,\u201d she said, adding that \u201creimagining\u201d businesses will come next. Companies that never even had websites might now sell their products online, she said, or restaurants could convert to food trucks while they \u2014 and their customers \u2014 rebuild.",
      "The grants came largely from GoFundMe.org\u2019s Wildfire Relief Fund, which has raised $7.7 million from 43,000 donors so far. Hilton, whose Malibu home burned in the Palisades Fire, donated $150,000 to the Wildfire Relief Fund.",
      "Her nonprofit, which normally focuses on protecting children and amplifying female voices, raised $1.2 million in the first week after the fires.",
      "Faquir said she and her mom will put the money toward building the restaurant, replacing equipment, and finally buying the land their diner has stood on for the last 53 years. \u201cIt\u2019s our family legacy,\u201d said Faquir. \u201cWe have to uphold what her mom started.\u201d",

      "Santa Fe-based Judge Matthew Wilson scheduled a hearing Monday to consider a request from estate representative Julia Peters to seal photos, video and documents to protect the family\u2019s constitutional right to privacy. The court put a temporary hold on the release of records pending the hearing.",
      "The partially mummified remains of Hackman and Arakawa were found in their Santa Fe home on Feb. 26, when maintenance and security workers showed up at the home and alerted police. Authorities have confirmed Hackman, 95, died of heart disease with complications from Alzheimer\u2019s disease about a week after his wife's death. Hackman may have been unaware Arakawa, 65, was dead.",
      "Her cause of death was listed as hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, which is a rare, rodent-borne disease.",
      "New Mexico\u2019s open records law blocks public access to sensitive images, including depictions of dead bodies. Experts also say some medical information is not considered public record under the state Inspection of Public Records Act.",
      "Peters has emphasized the possibly shocking nature of photographs and video in the investigation and potential for their dissemination by media in the bid to block them from being released.",
      "The Hackman family estate's lawsuit also seeks to block the release of autopsy reports by the Office of the Medical Investigator and death investigation reports by the Santa Fe County Sheriff\u2019s Office.",
      "The bulk of death investigations by law enforcement and autopsy reports by medical investigators are typically considered public records under state law in the spirit of ensuring government transparency and accountability.",
      "Authorities unraveled the mysterious circumstances of the couple's deaths and described their conclusions at a March 7 news conference without releasing most related written and photographic records.",
      "One of the couple\u2019s three dogs, a kelpie mix named Zinna, also was found dead in a crate in a bathroom closet near Arakawa. Two other dogs survived.",
      "The written request to seal the records notes the couple placed \u201ca significant value on their privacy and took affirmative vigilant steps\u201d to safeguard it during their lives, including after they moved to Santa Fe and Hackman retired. The state capital is known as a refuge for celebrities, artists and authors.",
      "Arakawa had no children, while Hackman is survived by three children from a previous marriage. Privacy likely also will play a role as the couple\u2019s estate is settled. According to probate court documents, Hackman signed an updated will in 2005 leaving his estate to his wife, while the will she signed that same year directed her estate to him. With both of them dying, management of the estate is in Peters' hands.",
      "A request is pending to appoint a trustee to administer assets in two trusts associated with the estate. Without trust documents being made public, it\u2019s unclear who the beneficiaries are and how the assets will be divided.",
      "Attorneys who specialize in estate planning in New Mexico say it\u2019s possible more details could come out if there were any legal disputes over the assets. Even then, they said, the parties likely would ask the court to seal the documents.",

      "Police say a woman is facing multiple charges after she crashed into a family out for a walk in Brooklyn, killing a mother and her two children",
      "NEW YORK -- A woman is facing multiple charges after she crashed into a family out for a walk in Brooklyn, killing a mother and her two children in what New York City Mayor Eric Adams described as a \u201ctragic accident of a Shakespearean proportion.\u201d",
      "Miriam Yarimi was charged hours after the Saturday afternoon crash with three counts each of criminal negligent homicide, manslaughter and assault in the second degree as well as several other charges.",
      "Police said Yarimi was driving on a suspended license and additional charges indicated she was speeding and failed to yield after stopping at a red light when she collided with another vehicle and then into the family walking in the crosswalk.",
      "\u201cI will call it like it is. This was a horrific tragedy caused by someone who shouldn\u2019t have been on the road,\u201d Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch told reporters at crash scene. \u201cA mother and two young children killed. Another child fighting for his life. A family and a neighborhood devastated.\u201d",
      "A phone number for Yarimi could not be found. Calls to the Kings County courts were not answered and there was no information in the court system about who might be representing her.",
      "Tisch said Yarimi's Audi rear-ended a Toyota around 1 p.m. Both drivers had minor injuries, as did another adult and three children in the Toyota. Yarimi had to be extracted from the wreck from her vehicle after it flipped over.",
      "The collision sent the Audi into the pedestrians, who were in the crosswalk before the vehicle overturned, authorities said. The 35-year-old woman and her 6- and 8-year-old daughters were pronounced dead at the scene, and the 4-year-old boy was hospitalized in critical condition.",
      "\u201cThis is extremely concerning and painful, not only to the City of New York in general, but specifically to a very close knit community,\u201d Adams said. \u201cA mother gone for a simple stroll on a sunny day was struck and killed. As we pray for their families and this entire community, the city mourns this loss.\u201d",

      "Wisconsin\u2019s attorney general has asked the liberal-controlled state Supreme Court to stop billionaire Elon Musk from handing over $1 million checks to two voters",
      "MADISON, Wis. -- Wisconsin's attorney general on Sunday asked the liberal-controlled state Supreme Court to stop billionaire Elon Musk from handing over $1 million checks to two voters, an appeal that came hours before President Donald Trump's ally planned the giveaway at an evening rally.",
      "An appeals court on Saturday rejected the legal challenge by Democrat Josh Kaul, who argues that Musk's offer violates a state law prohibiting giving anything of value in exchange for a vote.",
      "Wisconsin's tightly contested Supreme Court election, where ideological control of the court is at stake, is on Tuesday. Liberals currently hold a 4-3 majority.",
      "At Musk's rally scheduled in Green Bay at 7:30 p.m. EST, he promised to hand over a pair of $1 million checks to voters who signed an online petition against \u201cactivist\u201d judges.",
      "Trump and Musk are backing Waukesha County Judge Brad Schimel in the Supreme Court race, while Democrats are behind Dane County Judge Susan Crawford. Trump and groups he supports have spent more than $20 million to help Schimel get elected.",
      "Crawford's campaign declined to comment Sunday on the appeal.",
      "The justices who are being asked to decide the matter include the liberal incumbent whose retirement this year set up the race for an open seat and control of the court. The contest has shattered national spending records for a judicial election, with more than $81 million in spending.",
      "Musk\u2019s political action committee used a nearly identical tactic before the presidential election last year, offering to pay $1 million a day to voters in Wisconsin and six other battleground states who signed a petition supporting the First and Second Amendments. A judge in Pennsylvania said prosecutors failed to show the effort was an illegal lottery and allowed it to continue through Election Day.",
      "The appeals court said Saturday that the attorney general, in a \u201cminimally developed legal argument,\u201d failed to show that he was entitled to an order blocking Musk. The court also noted that Kaul alleged that the Columbia County Circuit Court had refused to hear his lawsuit, but he provided no details about the court\u2019s action.",
      "There is no entry for the county court's decision in the state\u2019s online court database and neither Kaul\u2019s office nor the state court office has provided any documentation to The Associated Press of the court\u2019s actions which came after business hours on Friday night.",
      "\u201cWe are not permitted to be the first court to decide whether the respondents are engaged in the conduct that is alleged, or to decide the legal status of that conduct,\u201d the appeals court said.",
      "Musk on Friday initially said in a post on his social media platform, X, that he planned to \u201cpersonally hand over\u201d $2 million to a pair of voters who have already cast their ballots in the race.",
      "Musk later posted a clarification, saying the money would go to people who will be \u201cspokesmen\u201d for an online petition against \u201cactivist\u201d judges. After first saying the event would only be open to people who had voted in the Supreme Court race, he said attendance would be limited to those who have signed the petition.",
      "Also on Friday, Musk\u2019s political action committee identified the recipient of its first $1 million giveaway \u2014 a Green Bay man who had donated to the Wisconsin GOP and the conservative candidate in the court race, and who has a history of posting support for Trump and his agenda.",
      "The judicial election comes as Wisconsin's highest court is expected to rule on abortion rights, congressional redistricting, union power and voting rules that could affect the 2026 midterms and the 2028 presidential election in the state.",

    "story": [
      "In the early part of his second term, President Donald Trump has taken action against individuals, law firms, private corporations, media companies and universities he regards as adversaries",
      "WASHINGTON -- The executive order directed at one of the country's most prestigious law firms followed a well-worn playbook as President Donald Trump roared down the road to retribution.",
      "Reaching beyond government, Trump has set out to impose his will across a broad swath of American life, from individuals who have drawn his ire to institutions known for their own flexes of power and intimidation.",
      "Which is how the Paul Weiss, a storied New York law firm that since its 1875 birth has advanced the cause of civil rights, shepherded the legal affairs of corporate power brokers and grown into a multi-billion-dollar multinational enterprise, came to learn it was in trouble. The reason: One of its former attorneys had investigated Trump as a Manhattan prosecutor.",
      "Trump ordered that federal security clearances of the firm's attorneys be reviewed for suspension, federal contracts terminated and employee access to federal buildings restricted. Yet the decree was soon averted in the most Trumpian of ways: with a deal.",
      "After a White House meeting with the firm's chairman yielded a series of commitments, including $40 million worth of legal work to support administration causes, the executive order was rescinded, but not without a backlash from a legal community that saw the resolution as a capitulation.",
      "The episode showed not only Trump's use of the power of the presidency to police dissent and punish adversaries but also his success in extracting concessions from law firms, academia, Silicon Valley and corporate boardrooms. These targets were suddenly made to fear for their futures in the face of a retribution campaign that has been a defining feature of his first two months in office.",
      "Just one day after Paul Weiss' deal, Columbia University disclosed policy changes under the threat of losing billions of dollars in federal money. A week later, the venerable law firm of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom cut a deal of its own before it could be hit by an executive order. Before that, ABC News and Meta reached multi-million-dollar settlements to resolve lawsuits from Trump.",
      "\u201cThe more of them that cave, the more extortion that that invites,\u201d said Ty Cobb, a White House lawyer in Trump\u2019s first term who has since become a sharp critic. \u201cYou\u2019ll see other universities and other law firms and other enemies of Trump assaulted and attacked into submission because of that.\"",
      "Some within the conservative legal community, by contrast, say the Republican president is acting within his right.",
      "\u201cIt's the president's prerogative to instruct the executive branch to do business with companies, law firms or contractors that he deems trustworthy \u2014 and the converse is true too,\u201d said Jay Town, a U.S. attorney from Alabama during Trump's first term. \u201cThe president, as the commander in chief, can determine who gets a clearance and who doesn't. It's as simple as that.\u201d",
      "Some targets have not given in, with two law firms since the Paul Weiss deal suing to block executive orders. Yet no matter their response, the sanctioned firms have generally run afoul of the White House by virtue of association with prosecutors who previously investigated Trump.",
      "If the negotiations have been surprising, consider that Trump telegraphed his approach during the campaign. \u201cFor those who have been wronged and betrayed, I am your retribution,\" he told supporters in March 2023.",
      "Less clear was: Retribution for what exactly? Against whom? By what means?",
      "The answers would come soon enough.",
      "Fresh off surviving four federal and state indictments that threatened to sink his political career, and investigations that shadowed his first term in office, Trump came straight for the prosecutors who investigated him and the elite firms he saw as sheltering them.",
      "His Justice Department moved almost immediately to fire the members of special counsel Jack Smith's team and some prosecutors who handled cases arising from the Capitol riot on Jan. 6, 2021.",
      "The White House followed up with an executive order that stripped security clearances from the lawyers at the law firm of Covington & Burling who have provided legal representation for Smith amid the threat of government investigations. Covington has said it looks forward to \"defending Mr. Smith's interests.\"",
      "A subsequent order punished Perkins Coie for its representation of then-Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton during the 2016 campaign and its part in funding opposition research on Trump that took the form of a dossier containing unsubstantiated allegations about Trump's ties to Russia.",
      "Its business hanging in the balance, Perkins Coie hired Williams & Connolly, a Washington firm with an aggressive litigation style, to challenge the order. A federal judge said the administration\u2019s action sent \u201cchills down my spine\" and blocked portions of it from taking effect. That decision could have been a meaningful precedent for other beleaguered firms.",
      "Except that's not what happened next.",
      "The chairman of Paul Weiss said it, too, was initially prepared to sue over a March 14 order that targeted the firm in part because a former partner, Mark Pomerantz, had several years earlier overseen an investigation into Trump\u2019s finances on behalf of the Manhattan district attorney\u2019s office.",
      "But the firm also came to believe that even a courtroom victory would not erase the perception among clients that it was \u201cpersona non grata\u201d with the administration, its chairman, Brad Karp, later told colleagues in an email obtained by The Associated Press.",
      "The order, Karp said, presented an \u201cexistential crisis\u201d for a firm that has counted among its powerhouse representations the NFL and ExxonMobil. Some of its clients signaled they might abandon ship. The hoped-for support from fellow firms never materialized and some even sought to exploit Paul Weiss' woes, Karp said.",
      "\u201cIt was very likely that our firm would not be able to survive a protracted dispute with the Administration,\u201d he wrote.",
      "When the opportunity came for a White House meeting and the chance to cut a deal, he took it, pledging pro bono legal services for causes such as the fight against antisemitism as well as representation without regard to clients' political affiliation. In so doing, he wrote, \u201cwe have quickly solved a seemingly intractable problem and removed a cloud of uncertainty that was hanging over our law firm.\u201d",
      "The outcry was swift. Lawyers outside the firm ridiculed it. More than 140 Paul Weiss alumni signed a letter assailing the capitulation.",
      "\u201cInstead of a ringing defense of the values of democracy, we witnessed a craven surrender to, and thus complicity in, what is perhaps the gravest threat to the independence of the legal profession since at least the days of Senator Joseph McCarthy,\" the letter said.",
      "Within days, two other firms, Jenner & Block and WilmerHale, were confronted with executive orders over their affiliation with prosecutors on Robert Mueller's special counsel team that investigated Trump during his first term. Both sued Friday. WilmerHale, where Mueller is a retired partner, said the order was an \u201cunprecedented assault\u201d on the legal system. After hearing arguments, judges blocked enforcement of key portions of both orders.",
      "Yet that very day, the White House trumpeted a fresh deal with Skadden Arps in which the firm agreed to provide $100 million of pro bono legal services and to disavow the use of diversity, employment and inclusion considerations in its hiring practices.",
      "Trump has expressed satisfaction with his pressure campaign, issuing a directive to sanction lawyers who are seen as bringing \u201cfrivolous\u201d litigation against the government. Universities, he marveled, are \u201cbending and saying \u2018Sir, thank you very much, we appreciate it.'\u201d",
      "As for law firms, he said, \u201cThey\u2019re just saying, \u2018Where do I sign?\u2019 Nobody can believe it.'\u201d",
      "Uptown from Paul Weiss's Midtown Manhattan home base, another elite New York institution was facing its own crucible.",
      "Trump had taken office against the backdrop of disruptive protests at Columbia University tied to Israel's war with Hamas. The turmoil prompted the resignation of its president and made the Ivy League school a target of critics who said an overly permissive campus environment had let antisemitic rhetoric flourish.",
      "The Trump administration this month arrested a prominent Palestinian activist and legal permanent resident in his university-owned apartment building and opened an investigation into whether Columbia hid students sought by the U.S. over their involvement in the demonstrations.",
      "In a separate action, the administration pulled $400 million from Columbia, canceling grants and contracts because of what the government said was the school's failure to stamp out antisemitism and demanding a series of changes as a condition for restoring the money or for even considering doing so.",
      "Two weeks later, the then-interim university president, Katrina Armstrong, announced that she would implement nearly all of the changes sought by the White House. Columbia would bar students from protesting in academic buildings, she said, adopt a new definition of antisemitism and put its Middle East studies department under new supervision.",
      "The university's March 21 rollout of reforms did not challenge the Trump administration's coercive tactics, but nodded to what it said were \u201clegitimate concerns\u201d raised about antisemitism. The White House has yet to say if it will restore the money.",
      "The Columbia resolution was condemned by some faculty members and free speech advocates.",
      "\u201cColumbia\u2019s capitulation endangers academic freedom and campus expression nationwide,\u201d Donna Lieberman, executive director of the New York Civil Liberties Union, said in a statement at the time.",
      "Armstrong on Friday night announced her exit from the position and her return to her post atop the school\u2019s medical center.",
      "Columbia is not Trump's sole target in academia. Also this month, the administration suspended about $175 million in federal funding for the University of Pennsylvania over a transgender swimmer who last competed for the school in 2022.",
      "Trump had not even taken office on Jan. 20 when one legal fight that could have followed him into office abruptly faded.",
      "In December, ABC News agreed to pay $15 million toward Trump\u2019s presidential library to settle a defamation lawsuit over anchor George Stephanopoulos\u2019 inaccurate on-air assertion that the president-elect had been found civilly liable for raping writer E. Jean Carroll.",
      "The following month, Meta, the parent company of Facebook, agreed to pay $25 million to settle a lawsuit filed by  Trump against the company after it suspended his accounts following the Jan. 6 riot.",
      "The agreement followed a visit by Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg to Trump's private Florida club to try to mend fences. Such a trip may have seemed unlikely in Trump's first term, or after the Capitol siege made him, briefly, a pariah within his own party. But it's something other technology, business and government officials have done.",
      "The administration, meanwhile, has taken action against news organizations whose coverage it disagrees with. The White House last month removed Associated Press reporters and photographers from the small group of journalists who follow the president in the pool and other events after the news agency declined to follow Trump\u2019s executive order to rename the Gulf of Mexico; a suit by the AP is pending.",
      "And the administration has sought to dismantle Voice of America, a U.S. government-funded international news service. On Friday, a federal judge halted plans to fire more than 1,200 journalists, engineers and other staff who were sidelined after Trump ordered a funding cut.",

      "President Donald Trump says \u201cLiberation Day\u201d is coming",
      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 President Donald Trump says Wednesday will be \u201cLiberation Day\" \u2014 a moment when he plans to roll out a set of tariffs that he promises will free the United States from foreign goods.",
      "The details of Trump's next round of import taxes are still sketchy. Most economic analyses say average U.S. families would have to absorb the cost of his tariffs in the form of higher prices and lower incomes. But an undeterred Trump is inviting CEOs to the White House to say they are investing hundreds of billions of dollars in new projects to avoid the import taxes.",
      "It is also possible that the tariffs are short-lived if Trump feels he can cut a deal after imposing them.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m certainly open to it, if we can do something,\" Trump told reporters. \"We\u2019ll get something for it.\u201d",
      "At stake are family budgets, America's prominence as the world's leading financial power and the structure of the global economy.",
      "Here's what you should know about the impending trade penalties:",
      "He wants to announce import taxes, including \u201creciprocal\u201d tariffs that would match the rates charged by other countries and account for other subsidies. Trump has talked about taxing the European Union, South Korea, Brazil and India, among other countries.",
      "As he announced 25% auto tariffs last week, he alleged that America has been ripped off because it imports more goods than it exports.",
      "\u201cThis is the beginning of Liberation Day in America,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to charge countries for doing business in our country and taking our jobs, taking our wealth, taking a lot of things that they\u2019ve been taking over the years. They\u2019ve taken so much out of our country, friend and foe. And, frankly, friend has been oftentimes much worse than foe.\u201d",
      "In an interview Saturday with NBC News, Trump said it did not bother him if tariffs caused vehicle prices to rise because autos with more U.S. content could possibly be more competitively priced.",
      "\"I hope they raise their prices, because if they do, people are gonna buy American-made cars,\" Trump said. \u201cI couldn\u2019t care less because if the prices on foreign cars go up, they\u2019re going to buy American cars.\u201d",
      "Trump has also suggested that he will be flexible with his tariffs, saying he will treat other nations better than they treated the United States. But he still has plenty of other taxes coming on imports.",
      "The Republican president plans to tax imported pharmaceutical drugs, copper and lumber. He has put forth a 25% tariff on any country that imports oil from Venezuela, even though the United States also does so. Imports from China are being charged an additional 20% tax because of its role in fentanyl production. Trump has imposed separate tariffs on goods from Canada and Mexico for the stated reason of stopping drug smuggling and illegal immigration. Trump also expanded his 2018 steel and aluminum tariffs to 25% on all imports.",
      "Some aides suggest the tariffs are tools for negotiation on trade and border security; others say the revenues will help reduce the federal budget deficit. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick says they will force other nations to show Trump \u201crespect.\u201d",
      "Nothing good, according to most economists. They say the tariffs would get passed along to consumers in the form of higher prices for autos, groceries, housing and other goods. Corporate profits could be lower and growth more sluggish. Trump maintains that more companies would open factories to avoid the taxes, though that process could take three years or more.",
      "Economist Art Laffer estimates the tariffs on autos, if fully implemented, could increase per vehicle costs by $4,711, though he said he views Trump as a smart and savvy negotiator. The investment bank Goldman Sachs estimates the economy will grow this quarter at an annual rate of just 0.6%, down from a rate of 2.4% at the end of last year.",
      "Mayor Andrew Ginther of Columbus, Ohio, said on Friday that tariffs could increase the median cost of a home by $21,000, making affordability more of an obstacle because building materials would cost more.",
      "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has suggested that tariffs would be a one-time price adjustment, rather than the start of an inflationary spiral. But Bessent's conclusion rests on tariffs being brief or contained, rather than leading other countries to retaliate with their own tariffs or seeping into other sectors of the economy.",
      "\u201cThere is a chance tariffs on goods begin to filter through to the pricing of services,\u201d said Samuel Rines, a strategist at WisdomTree. \u201cAuto parts get move expensive, then auto repair gets more expensive, then auto insurance feels the pressure. While goods are the focus, tariffs could have a longer-term effect on inflation.\u201d",
      "Most foreign leaders see the tariffs as destructive for the global economy, even if they are prepared to impose their own countermeasures.",
      "Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney said Trump's tariff threats had ended the partnership between his country and the United States, even as the president on Friday talked about his phone call with Carney in relatively positive terms. Canada already has announced retaliatory tariffs.",
      "French President Emmanuel Macron said the tariffs were \u201cnot coherent\u201d and would mean \"breaking value chains, creating inflation in the short term and destroying jobs. It\u2019s not good for the American economy, nor for the European, Canadian or Mexican economies.\u201d Yet Macron said his nation would defend itself with the goal of dismantling the tariffs.",
      "Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum has avoided the tit-for-tat responses on tariffs, but she sees it as critical to defend jobs in her country.",
      "The Chinese government said Trump's tariffs would harm the global trading system and would not fix the economic challenges identified by Trump.",
      "\u201cThere are no winners in trade wars or tariff wars, and no country\u2019s development and prosperity are achieved through imposing tariffs,\u201d Foreign Ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun said.",
      "Based off Trump's public statements, April 2 is at least the third \u201cliberation day\u201d that he has identified.",
      "At a rally last year in Nevada, he said the day of the presidential election, Nov. 5, would be \u201cLiberation Day in America.\u201d He later gave his inauguration the same label, declaring in his address: \u201cFor American citizens, Jan. 20, 2025, is Liberation Day.\u201d",
      "His repeated designation of the term is a sign of just how much importance Trump places on tariffs, an obsession of his since the 1980s. Dozens of other countries recognize their own form of liberation days to recognize events such as overcoming Nazi Germany or the end of a previous political regime deemed oppressive.",
      "Trump sees his tariffs as providing national redemption, but the slumping consumer confidence and stock market indicate that much of the public believes the U.S. economy will pay the price for his ambitions.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t see anything positive about Liberation Day,\" said Phillip Braun, a finance professor at Northwestern University's Kellogg School of Management. \u201cIt\u2019s going to hurt the U.S. economy. Other countries are going to retaliate.\u201d",

      "At least half of U.S. states now outlaw devices that can convert pistols into machine guns",
      "In New Mexico, police and prosecutors backed an effort to outlaw devices that convert pistols into machine guns. In Alabama, the governor made it a priority.",
      "Lawmakers in both states \u2014 one led by Democrats, the other by Republicans \u2014 responded this year with new laws making so-called Glock switches illegal.",
      "At least half of U.S. states now have similar laws prohibiting the possession of such devices, a list that has grown over the past decade as law enforcement officers have found more of the tiny yet powerful devices attached to guns.",
      "States are mimicking federal law, which for for decades has generally prohibited machine guns and any parts that can transform semiautomatic weapons into automatic ones.",
      "U.S. law defines a machine gun as a weapon that automatically fires more than one shot with a single pull of a trigger. The definition also includes any parts designed to convert a weapon into a machine gun.",
      "Federal law prohibits possessing machine guns made after 1986, with some exceptions for law enforcement, the military and certain licensed dealers. Nearly all conversion devices are illegal because they were made more recently.",
      "People convicted of possessing machine guns and conversion devices can face up to 10 years in prison.",
      "A Glock switch is one type of a machine gun conversion device. It's a metal or plastic piece, about the size of a coin, that attaches to the back of Glock pistol, a brand that is popular with both police and criminals. The switch interferes with a gun's internal trigger components so that it fires continuously when the trigger is pulled back and held.",
      "A gun outfitted with a switch can fire dozens of bullets in mere seconds, similar to a factory-made machine gun.",
      "Other brands of pistols that mimic Glocks also can be converted to machine guns. So can some semiautomatic rifles. Such conversion devices also are referred to as auto sears, selector switches or chips.",
      "The use of auto sears spiked in the past decade, partly because they can be made inexpensively with 3D printers.",
      "From 2012 to 2016, just 814 machine gun conversion parts were taken into custody by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. That swelled to 5,454 from 2017-2021.",
      "In January, former President Joe Biden's administration said 12,360 suspected machine gun conversion devices had been recovered in the U.S. and submitted to the ATF during a roughly 34-month period ending in October 2024.",
      "Five states including Florida, Illinois, Texas, Montana and North Dakota accounted for nearly half that total.",
      "Alabama is the latest state to outlaw Glock switches. A law signed this month by Republican Gov. Kay Ivey makes possessing parts designed to convert pistols into machine guns a felony punishable by up to 10 years in prison.",
      "The bipartisan push in Alabama came after police said they believed conversion devices had been used in fatal shootings, including one in September that killed four and injured 17 people outside a Birmingham lounge.",
      "Democratic New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham signed a law in February making possession of a weapon conversion device a felony punishable by up to three years in prison.",
      "Similar legislation passed the New Jersey General Assembly last week and now heads to the Senate. Bills also are pending in other states.",
      "Republican Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin signed a law last year making auto sears illegal. But Youngkin vetoed legislation this past week that would have broadened an existing ban on \u201ctrigger activators\u201d to cover additional devices that increase firing rates of semiautomatic weapons.",
      "Groups such as Everytown for Gun Safety say state laws provide a sometimes easier alternative to federal prosecution for possessing Glock switches. But they want to go further.",
      "Everytown for Gun Safety is backing legislation in California, Maryland and New York that would make it illegal to sell pistols that could be transformed into machine guns.",
      "\u201cThat really puts the pressure where it belongs \u2014 on the manufactures that are making money off of guns that they know can be readily turned into machine guns,\u201d said Nick Suplina, senior vice president for law and policy at Everytown for Gun Safety.",
      "Several cities and states including Baltimore, Chicago, Minnesota and New Jersey have sued Glock for making pistols that can be converted by others to automatic weapons.",
      "The National Rifle Association notes U.S. attorneys already can prosecute people for misusing gun conversion devices without the need for state laws.",
      "Gun Owners of America, another gun-rights group, contends people should have a Second Amendment right to own machine guns. State laws against machine gun conversation devices are \u201cduplicative\u201d and \u201cpure virtue signaling,\u201d said Aidan Johnston, federal affairs director for Gun Owners of America.",
      "He said guns converted to fire automatically can have practical uses like eliminating large groups of feral hogs that are destroying land.",
      "\u201cJust because you put that on your firearm doesn\u2019t mean that you are a violent criminal or that you necessarily are a dangerous person,\" Johnston said.",

      "Norfolk Southern wants two other companies to help pay for the $600 million class-action settlement it agreed to over its disastrous 2023 train derailment near the Ohio-Pennsylvania border and the toxic chemicals that were released and burned.",
      "The railroad filed the motion that is set to go to trial starting Monday to force the railcar owner GATX and the chemical manufacturer OxyVinyls to share the cost of the settlement because Norfolk Southern believes those companies are partly responsible for what happened in East Palestine, Ohio, on Feb. 3, 2023.",
      "This lawsuit won't change anything about how much money residents will receive from the settlement or any payments the village or anyone else is set to receive because those are all established in various settlement agreements. This case will only affect which company has to write the checks to pay for the class-action settlement.",
      "Residents are still waiting to receive most of the money from the settlement because of pending appeals, although some payments have started to go out.",
      "An assortment of chemicals spilled and caught fire after the train derailed in East Palestine. Three days later, officials blew open five tank cars filled with vinyl chloride because they feared those cars might explode, generating a massive black plume of smoke that spread over the town and forced evacuations.",
      "Many residents still worry today about potential health consequences from those chemicals.",
      "The derailment was the worst rail disaster since a crude oil train devastated the small Canadian town of Lac-Megantic and killed 47 people in 2013. It prompted the U.S. to focus on rail safety and reforms, which were proposed in Congress before stalling without passing.",
      "Norfolk Southern already lost a similar lawsuit last year when it tried to force GATX and OxyVinyls to help pay for the environmental cleanup after the derailment that has cost the Atlanta-based railroad more than $1 billion. It is making similar arguments again to try to get help paying for the class-action settlement.",
      "\u201cNorfolk Southern alone has paid the costs relating to the derailment despite ample evidence that other parties share in the responsibility. This trial is about reinforcing the role shippers and railcar owners play in transportation safety and ensuring everyone responsible pays their fair share,\" the railroad said in a statement.",
      "Norfolk Southern, like most railroads, doesn\u2019t own most of the cars it hauls, and the railroad says everyone involved in shipping hazardous chemicals bears some responsibility for ensuring their safety under federal regulations.",
      "Norfolk Southern argues GATX bears some responsibility for the derailment because it owned the railcar filled with plastic pellets that caused the derailment when its bearing overheated, caught fire and failed that night, sending 38 cars off the rails.",
      "Norfolk Southern also said it believes OxyVinyls should pay because the railroad says chemical manufacturer provided inconsistent and inaccurate information about its vinyl chloride before officials decided to release and burn it.",
      "Both GATX and OxyVinyls say it would be ridiculous to hold them responsible for the derailment when Norfolk Southern operated and inspected the train and all the cars and was responsible for delivering the cargo safely.",
      "\u201cNorfolk Southern\u2019s claims against GATX are baseless,\" the railcar owner said in a statement.",
      "GATX said it complied with all the relevant regulations for taking care of its railcars. The company said that even if the car was damaged six years earlier by standing parked in the middle of floodwaters from Hurricane Harvey, the railroad should have spotted the problem and repaired it, sending GATX the bill for the repairs.",
      "The National Transportation Safety Board said the crash was caused by the failure of an overheating bearing on GATX's railcar. The railroad\u2019s sensors spotted the bearing starting to heat up in the miles before the derailment, but it didn\u2019t reach a critical temperature and trigger an alarm until just before the derailment. That left the crew scant time to stop the train.",
      "Norfolk Southern recommended the vent-and-burn operation to release the vinyl chloride based partly on information about the chemical that OxyVinyls had published beforehand suggesting a chemical reaction could happen and cause the tank cars to explode.",
      "But the NTSB confirmed in its investigation that was unnecessary because the tank cars were starting to cool off and the railroad failed to listen to the advice from OxyVinyls' experts or share their opinions with the officials who made the decision.",
      "\u201cThis trial is nothing more than Norfolk Southern\u2019s continued attempt to shift the blame, attention, and financial responsibility for its train derailment, response, and vent and burn decision to anyone other than itself,\u201d the Texas-based company said. \u201cOxyVinyls did not cause the derailment, its tank cars did not breach, and it did not make the decision to vent and burn the VCM (vinyl chloride monomer) cars.\u201d",
      "The trial is expected to last two to three weeks.",

    "summary": "Many women are in prison for killing their abusive partners",
    "story": [
      "Many women are in prison for killing their abusive partners",
      "ATLANTA -- Mary Favors is still plagued by nightmares from the days her husband beat her, choked her and verbally and sexually abused her. Now, she is in prison for killing him.",
      "Their disagreements often turned physical, and five times he was convicted of abusing her. Then one night in April 2011, court records show, Troy Favors began shouting and hitting her before chasing her to their bedroom.",
      "She quickly closed the door, alone inside, tying the bedroom door with a string because he had kicked it down before. She grabbed a knife in case he did that again, just before he burst in. When she told him to back off, he refused and, according to Favors, he jumped on the knife. Prosecutors accused her of stabbing him.",
      "\u201cIt happened so fast,\u201d Favors, 58, told The Associated Press from prison in Georgia, later adding, \u201cI felt my life was at risk.\u201d",
      "Between 74% and 95% of incarcerated women have survived domestic abuse or sexual violence, according to the Georgia Coalition Against Domestic Violence. Many were tried without fair opportunities to prove the scope of the abuse and how it led them to act in self-defense, while others were coerced into crimes, according to advocates, who add that certain laws disproportionately criminalize abused women.",
      "At other times, they say, people simply don\u2019t believe women\u2019s stories, with women of color like Favors who survive abuse especially likely to end up in prison.",
      "But under the Georgia Survivor Justice Act, which passed the state House overwhelmingly with bipartisan support and still awaits Senate consideration ahead of the session\u2019s end this week, abuse survivors could secure early release from prison.",
      "The bill calls for judges to resentence those who are incarcerated and impose shorter sentences on those who are convicted if they can tie their crimes to domestic abuse. It also would expand what can be presented as supporting evidence.",
      "It's all part of a broader move toward reform that has gained momentum nationwide. New York, California, Illinois and Oklahoma have already passed laws intended to reduce sentences for victims of abuse who face charges or were convicted. Missouri, Connecticut and Massachusetts are considering similar legislation.",
      "Facing possible life in prison for charges including murder, Favors pleaded guilty to a lesser charge of voluntary manslaughter and three other offenses. She received the maximum of 20 years in prison for the killing and five years of probation for having the knife. Many incarcerated survivors are serving life sentences.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s this blurring of the lines between victim and suspect when girls and women are criminalized for the sexual violence that they experience,\u201d said Rebecca Epstein, executive director of the Center on Gender Justice and Opportunity at Georgetown Law.",
      "After her husband's death, Favors transported the body and left it elsewhere. Research shows similar snap decisions by victims in response to trauma can taint how jurors, judges and prosecutors see defendants, said Leigh Goodmark, a University of Maryland law professor who studies the criminalization of domestic violence.",
      "Goodmark hopes efforts like Georgia\u2019s will help judges and prosecutors \u201csee that victimization is much more complicated than they want it to be.\"",
      "Current Georgia law is strict about how lawyers can bring in evidence of domestic abuse, said Ellie Williams, legal director with the Georgia Coalition Against Domestic Violence. She is spearheading the legislation, which would loosen some restrictions, and said the strict guidelines reflect outdated understandings of abuse.",
      "\u201cThings that we don\u2019t always take seriously matter, and we explicitly and implicitly require things that don't adequately allow for the actual dynamics of abuse to be considered,\u201d Williams said.",
      "Under Georgia's bill, if a judge determines family violence, dating violence or child abuse contributed to a crime with a minimum sentence of life in prison, the judge, in most cases, would have to impose a sentence of 10 to 30 years in prison.",
      "For other felonies, judges would not be able to sentence the defendant to more than half of the maximum sentence they could have otherwise gotten. People in prison could also request resentencing under the rules if the act ultimately becomes law.",
      "Georgia\u2019s bill would also make it easier for courts to consider domestic violence in cases involving self-defense or victims being coerced into committing a crime, which is common.",
      "The bill is \u201cnot a get out of jail free card,\u201d said bill sponsor Rep. Stan Gunter, a Republican.",
      "The day the House voted on it, several district attorneys contacted their representatives to oppose it.",
      "Randy McGinley, district attorney for the Alcovy Judicial Circuit, said during a committee hearing that families may become upset if the person who killed their loved one walks free from prison early. The Prosecuting Attorneys' Council, which McGinley was representing, is taking a neutral stance after persuading lawmakers to make some changes.",
      "Under New York's 2019 bill, The Survivors Justice Project said at least 71 people have received a reduction and 85 applications were denied.",
      "A few have gone home under The Oklahoma Survivors' Act, passed last year. But a bill failed this year that could have provided some sentencing relief for women who were convicted under Oklahoma's \u201cfailure to protect\u201d law for not protecting children from their abusers. They often receive sentences equal to or more than their abusers.",
      "Born in New Jersey, Favors liked to ice skate and go to school when she was young. She spoke of feeling unloved as an adopted child and found it hard to leave men even when they treated her badly.",
      "Favors tears up when she talks about her husband, whom she still loves. She drove him to work every day and wishes they had had resources to overcome mental health battles and their drug addictions.",
      "Now drug-free, Favors dreams of working at a battered women's shelter. In prison, she earned her high school diploma and took classes about abuse. To heal, she prays, fasts, reads her Bible and meets with others in a prison ministry, sharing what God did for them.",

    "story": [
      "U.S. immigration officials are asking the public and federal agencies to comment on a proposal to collect social media handles from people applying to benefits such as green cards or citizenship, to comply with an executive order from President Donald ...",
      "SAN FRANCISCO -- U.S. immigration officials are asking the public and federal agencies to comment on a proposal to collect social media handles from people applying for benefits such as green cards or citizenship, to comply with an executive order from President Donald Trump.",
      "The March 5 notice raised alarms from immigration and free speech advocates because it appears to expand the government's reach in social media surveillance to people already vetted and in the U.S. legally, such as asylum seekers, green card and citizenship applicants -- and not just those applying to enter the country. That said, social media monitoring by immigration officials has been a practice for over a decade, since at least the second Obama administration and ramping up under Trump's first term.",
      "Below are some questions and answers on what the new proposal means and how it might expand social media surveillance.",
      "The Department of Homeland Security issued a 60-day notice asking for public commentary on its plan to comply with Trump's executive order titled \u201cProtecting the United States from Foreign Terrorists and Other National Security and Public Safety Threats.\" The plan calls for \u201cuniform vetting standards\u201d and screening people for grounds of inadmissibility to the U.S., as well as identify verification and \u201cnational security screening.\u201d It seeks to collect social media handles and the names of platforms, although not passwords.",
      "The policy seeks to require people to share their social media handles when applying for U.S. citizenship, green card, asylum and other immigration benefits. The proposal is open to feedback from the public until May 5.",
      "\u201cThe basic requirements that are in place right now is that people who are applying for immigrant and non-immigrant visas have to provide their social media handles,\u201d said Rachel Levinson-Waldman, managing director of the Brennan Center\u2019s Liberty and National Security Program at New York University. \u201cWhere I could see this impacting is someone who came into the country before visa-related social media handle collection started, so they wouldn\u2019t have provided it before and now they\u2019re being required to. Or maybe they did before, but their social media use has changed.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis fairly widely expanded policy to collect them for everyone applying for any kind of immigration benefit, including people who have already been vetted quite extensively,\u201d she added.",
      "What this points to \u2014 along with other signals the administration is sending such as detaining people and revoking student visas for participating in campus protests that the government deems antisemitic and sympathetic to the militant Palestinian group Hamas \u2014 Levinson-Waldman added, is the increased use of social media to \u201cmake these very high-stakes determinations about people.\u201d",
      "In a statement, a spokesperson for the United States Citizenship and Immigration Service said the agency seeks to \u201cstrengthen fraud detection, prevent identity theft, and support the enforcement of rigorous screening and vetting measures to the fullest extent possible.\u201d",
      "\u201cThese efforts ensure that those seeking immigration benefits to live and work in the United States do not threaten public safety, undermine national security, or promote harmful anti-American ideologies,\u201d the statement continued. USCIS estimates that the proposed policy change will affect about 3.6 million people.",
      "The U.S. government began ramping up the use of social media for immigration vetting in 2014 under then-President Barack Obama, according to the Brennan Center for Justice. In late 2015, the Department of Homeland Security began both \u201cmanual and automatic screening of the social media accounts of a limited number of individuals applying to travel to the United States, through various non-public pilot programs,\u201d the nonpartisan law and policy institute explains on its website.",
      "In May 2017, the U.S. Department of State issued an emergency notice to increase the screening of visa applicants. Brennan, along with other civil and human rights groups, opposed the move, arguing that it is \u201cexcessively burdensome and vague, is apt to chill speech, is discriminatory against Muslims, and has no security benefit.\u201d",
      "Two years later, the State Department began collecting social media handles from \u201cnearly all foreigners\u201d applying for visas to travel to the U.S. \u2014 about 15 million people a year.",
      "Artificial intelligence tools used to comb through potentially millions of social media accounts have evolved over the past decade, although experts caution that such tools have limits and can make mistakes.",
      "Leon Rodriguez, who served as the director of USCIS from 2014 to 2017 and now practices as an immigration attorney, said while AI could be used as a first screening tool, he doesn't think \u201cwe're anywhere close to where AI will be able to exercise the judgment of a trained fraud detection and national security officer\" or that of someone in an intelligence agency.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s also possible that I will miss stuff,\u201d he added. \u201cBecause AI is still very much driven by specific search criteria and it\u2019s possible that the search criteria won't hit actionable content.\u201d",
      "\u201cSocial media is just a stew, so much different information \u2014 some of it is reliable, some of it isn\u2019t. Some of it can be clearly attributed to somebody, some of it can\u2019t. And it can be very hard to interpret,\u201d Levinson-Waldman said. \u201cSo I think as a baseline matter, just using social media to make high-stakes decisions is quite concerning.\u201d",
      "Then there's the First Amendment.",
      "\u201cIt's by and large established that people in the U.S. have First Amendment rights,\u201d she said. This includes people who are not citizens. \u201cAnd obviously, there are complicated ways that that plays out. There is also fairly broad authority for the government to do something like revoking somebody\u2019s visa, if you\u2019re not a citizen, then there\u2019s steps that the government can take \u2014 but by and large, with very narrow exceptions, that cannot be on the grounds of speech that would be protected (by the First Amendment).\"",

      "President Donald Trump is making his clearest commitment to not fire anyone over an embarrassing accidental leak of his administration\u2019s plans for an airstrike against the Houthis in Yemen",
      "WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. -- President Donald Trump on Saturday made his clearest commitment to not fire anyone over an embarrassing accidental leak of his administration\u2019s plans for an airstrike against the Houthis in Yemen.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t fire people because of fake news and because of witch hunts,\u201d Trump said in an interview with NBC News' Kristen Welker.",
      "He also said that he had confidence in Mike Waltz, his national security adviser, and Pete Hegseth, his Pentagon chief.",
      "Waltz inadvertently added Jeffrey Goldberg, the editor of The Atlantic magazine, to a group text using the Signal encrypted messaging service where top officials were discussing plans to attack the Houthis.",
      "During the chat, Hegseth included details on how the strike would unfold before it took place.",
      "Afterwards, The Atlantic published an article on the internal exchange, shocking the national security establishment.",
      "Trump is eager to avoid repeating some of the turnover that characterized his first term. Mike Flynn, his first national security adviser, was pushed out after only a few weeks during the early phase of the Russia investigation. He\u2019s also shown resistance to bowing to outside pressure, especially if it comes from the news media.",
      "Asked if there were conversations about firing Waltz, Trump insisted, \u201cI\u2019ve never heard that. And nobody else makes that decision but me, and I\u2019ve never heard it.\u201d",

      "Prosecutors in California say San Bernardino County deputies involved in a shootout that killed a teenage girl and her fugitive father will not face any criminal charges",
      "San Bernardino County sheriff's deputies involved in a 2022 shootout along a California freeway that killed a teenage girl and her fugitive father will not face any criminal charges, state Attorney General Rob Bonta announced Friday.",
      "Bonta released a report compiled by the California Department of Justice following an investigation that included interviews with officers, witnesses who were driving along the road that day and family members who recalled that the man and his daughter had a close relationship. The attorney general called the incident a tragic situation with a tragic outcome.",
      "\u201cThis report was quite difficult to publish, and I sincerely hope it provides the community with the answers they\u2019ve been waiting for,\" Bonta said in a statement. \"The California Department of Justice aims to partner with law enforcement to build a just and equitable legal environment, ensuring that the rule of law is upheld, and justice is accessible to everyone.\u201d",
      "Video and audio released by the San Bernardino County Sheriff\u2019s Department showed Savannah Graziano, 15, was shot and killed as she approached deputies amid a hail of gunfire on Sept. 27, 2022. The video footage recorded by a sheriff\u2019s helicopter and witness dashboard cameras was released in 2024 in response to public records requests made by The Associated Press and other media outlets.",
      "According to the Department of Justice review, 45-year-old Anthony Graziano drove off with his daughter after he shot and killed Tracy Martinez \u2014 his 45-year-old estranged wife \u2014 as she tried to flee from his pickup truck. Authorities said the teen was in the truck when her mother was shot, and an Amber Alert was issued.",
      "San Bernardino County deputies spotted the truck the next day, and a 41-mile (66-kilometer) pursuit ensued on Interstate 15. As Anthony Graziano was driving, authorities said numerous rounds were fired at deputies from the rear and passenger-side windows of the vehicle. Audio from the deputies' belt recorders included the sounds of rounds hitting their patrol vehicles. One deputy sustained gunshot wounds to his arm and to fingers on both of his hands.",
      "Authorities said shots continued to be fired from Graziano's truck after he drove off the freeway and up an embankment. About 65 spent casings and four firearms were found in the truck. The investigation also determined that 21 deputies returned fire.",
      "The report states that the vehicle came to a stop and the teen \u2014 wearing a tactical helmet and vest \u2014 got out of the front passenger door and initially crouched on the ground. She then got up and moved toward a deputy as he called out to her. She raised her right hand, and that is when other deputies opened fire, according to the report.",
      "Anthony Graziano was found dead in the driver's seat. Autopsy results showed he died from a gunshot wound to the head and also suffered gunshot wounds to his shoulder, lower back and leg. A toxicology report showed he had methamphetamine and amphetamine as well as morphine and hydrocodone in his blood and urine.",
      "No drugs or alcohol were found in Savannah Graziano\u2019s blood or urine. Her cause of death was listed as gunshot wounds.",
      "Gunshot residue was present in samples taken from the hands of both the teen and her father. The report notes that gunshot residue particles can be deposited by firing a firearm, being in proximity of a discharging firearm, or by handling a firearm or ammunition.",
      "The report states \u201cno conclusion\" can be drawn from the residue testing as to whether the teen or her father fired a firearm. But in attempting to recreate multiple shooting positions from inside the truck given the location of powder burns left by the muzzle of a rifle found in the vehicle, investigators found that the driver would not have been able to shoot the rifle and still maintain control of the gas and brake pedals.",
      "Prosecutors noted in the report that evidence suggested that deputies believed both Graziano and his daughter \u2014 who was experienced at handling firearms and had participated in firearms training drills with her father \u2014 posed an imminent threat and that the need to use lethal force was reasonable.",
      "Family members told authorities that Graziano had been living in his truck and that his daughter would often stay with him, sleeping in the truck next to a park. They said the teen was upset about her parents' divorce.",
      "The report also included recommendations related to training and dash-mounted and body-worn camera policies. The attorney general's office said the sheriff's department had implemented the training recommendations following the incident.",

      "MoneySavingExpert says you can save money by using the principle: \"heat the human, not the home\". Using hot water bottles and electric blankets should work out cheaper than turning up the radiators.",
      "You can also change the settings on combi or conventional boilers to save money, says Martin Lewis at MoneySavingExpert.",
      "When it comes to transport bills, you can't avoid the vehicle tax rise unless you ditch the car altogether.",
      "But if you are taking the train it is also worth checking whether a railcard will help, points out Ms Seymour.",
      "\"To cut costs on rail fares, we'd recommend booking tickets in advance and splitting fares where possible,\" she says.",
      "3. Get help",
      "If you are struggling to pay your household bills, don't panic, says Richard Lane, chief client officer at the StepChange Debt Charity. He suggests creating a detailed budget that captures all your income and expenditure.",
      "\"This will allow you to get a clear picture of your finances and see how much you have leftover to pay toward any debts or make savings,\" he says.",
      "Then check what support you are entitled to.",
      "Water companies offer lower \"social\" and hardship tariffs for people on very low incomes, so it is worth calling your provider. People claiming benefits can often also get lower tariffs for broadband.",
      "\"These organisations have a regulatory responsibility to treat customers fairly and will be able to offer you tailored support,\" Mr Lane added.",
      "There is the government's Warm Home Discount, for people with high energy costs on a very low income, including Pension Credit. And people on low incomes are also eligible for a reduction in council tax.",
      "Check if you qualify for a free TV licence. If you are over 75 and on Pension Credit or live with someone who is, then you will.",
      "You may also be able to boost your income. Check which benefits you are entitled to on the independent MoneyHelper website, backed by the government, or using benefits calculators run by Policy in Practice and charities Entitledto and Turn2us.",
      "If you are struggling with debt here are some other organisations that may be able to help."

      "\"That means being prepared to impose reciprocal tariffs if necessary, including on Elon Musk's Teslas, and urgently negotiating a better trade deal with the EU to show Trump we have alternatives.\"",
      "It comes after Sir Keir Starmer spoke to Trump over the phone on Sunday, with Downing Street saying the pair had \"productive negotiations\" about an economic deal.",
      "The government has argued the UK has a relatively equal trading relationship with the US, compared to its other partners.",
      "The independent Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) has warned a reciprocal trade war would wipe billions off economic growth and all but eliminate the headroom Chancellor Rachel Reeves has to stay within her self-imposed rules on spending and borrowing.",

      "The OBR's latest economic forecast, published on Wednesday, said GDP would be 0.6% lower than forecast this year and 1% lower next year in the most \"severe\" scenario, in which the UK and other nations retaliated to Trump's tariffs.",
      "In an alternative scenario where the UK does not retaliate, the OBR has forecast a smaller reduction in growth, with GDP 0.4% lower than expected this year and 0.6% lower next year.",
      "It is unclear how the UK would retaliate if tariffs do come into effect. There are a range of options available, from duties on sectors where British products are particularly important to the US, to focusing on specific products like Harley Davidson motorcycles.",

      "What impact could tariffs have on the UK?",
      "by Dharshini David, deputy economics editor",
      "The impact of a US tariff on all British goods is very uncertain. It depends on not just on the scale of any tariffs applied on British products, but how the government, businesses and consumers react.",
      "As the car industry knows already, tariffs are extremely worrying for the industries affected - as an exporter you hope that either some of it can be soaked up in the supply chain or your American customers will be happy to pay higher prices - or you take a hit to your own profits by lowering prices.",
      "Or you may lose sales, tariffs are undeniably bad news for exporters in the firing line.",
      "But their impact on prices in the UK is uncertain. If the UK government retaliates with tariffs on American products, households here could face rises. But countries such as China, if disadvantaged by American tariffs, could try to send their goods here instead, pushing down prices.",
      "Broadly, US tariffs would be detrimental to UK growth. Without retaliatory tariffs, the UK's official forecasters reckon that 0.6% could be knocked off UK growth next year - unhelpful but not disastrous. Underpinning that scenario is a number of assumptions.",
      "But, as it cautions, there are so many uncertainties about not just the policy, but how it would filter through."

      "ABF declined to provide any further details, including whether the incidents involved colleagues or individuals from outside the company. A spokesperson told the BBC this was to protect their identities as much as possible.",
      "'Immensely disappointed'",
      "Mr Marchant became chief executive of Primark in 2009, taking over from the firm's founder Arthur Ryan.",
      "In announcing Mr Marchant's resignation, George Weston, chief executive of ABF, said: \"I am immensely disappointed. Colleagues and others must be treated with respect and dignity. Our culture has to be, and is, bigger than any one individual.\"",
      "He added: \"At ABF, we believe that high standards of integrity are essential. Acting responsibly is the only way to build and manage a business over the long term.\"",
      "The company said it remains in contact with the individual \"who rightly raised her concerns and have offered her our support\".",
      "While Primark - or Penneys as it is known in Ireland - has been around since 1969 when Mr Ryan opened the first shop in Dublin, it began ramping up its overseas expansion under Mr Marchant's leadership.",
      "Its low-price clothing and rapidly changing stock won over cash-strapped but fashion-conscious younger customers. Although, according to Catherine Shuttleworth, retail analyst at the consultancy Savvy, it has got \"ubiquitous appeal\".",
      "She said: \"It has allowed access to affordable clothing for everybody and that has tied into a period of time where global supply chains have significantly changed, so that means you can access products and materials better and more easily.\"",
      "Prior to Primark, Mr Marchant worked for a number of retailers such as Debenhams, Topman and New Look. But, like his predecessor Mr Ryan, he has remained out of the spotlight.",
      "Ms Shuttleworth said Primark's leadership \"flies under the radar a bit because - it sounds a bit cheesy - they let their shops and their products do the talking\".",
      "Unlike many of its rivals, Primark resisted selling its products online before finally relenting in 2022 after Covid restrictions drove people to internet shopping. Even then, Primark only launched a click-and-collect service as opposed to offering deliveries.",
      "Like other low-cost fashion chains, Primark has been criticised for producing cheap, throwaway clothing.",
      "In a rare interview, Mr Marchant told the BBC in 2022: \"We have worked so hard and continue to work hard on ensuring that we're improving the quality and the durability of our clothing.",
      "\"We don't want customers to buy something and then discard it. We want them to buy, love and keep it in their wardrobe [and] hand it down to their friends.\"",
      "'Unsettling'",
      "Primark is a key part of the wider ABF business, contributing nearly half of the group's overall sales of \u00a320bn.",
      "However, in its most recent trading update covering the Christmas period, Primark reported a fall in sales for the UK and Ireland, which accounts for 45% of the retailer's revenues.",
      "ABF's share price fell by nearly 4% to \u00a318.64 after Monday's announcement.",
      "Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown, said Mr Marchant's departure came at a trying time for Primark.",
      "''The change at the top will be unsettling particularly given that Primark delivered a very mixed bag of results at the last count,\" she said.",
      "\"This leadership upset comes amid weaker consumer sentiment which has meant footfall at its stores has fallen - and the chain has been losing market share in the UK.\"",
      "She said that internationally the company has performed well, but added: \"There could be uncertainty ahead about the speed of expansion given the change of boss.\"",
      "Following Mr Marchant's \"immediate\" departure, ABF's finance director Eoin Tonge will become Primark's interim chief executive.",
      "The firm's financial controller, Joana Edwards, will step into Mr Tonge's role. The company said: \"Both executives have the experience to perform these roles well.\"",
      "ABF is majority-owned by the billionaire Weston family who, until 2021, owned  the department store Selfridges."

      "The exact amount you pay will depend on your individual circumstances and where you live.",
      "Although minimum wages are also increasing, and wages on average have been outpacing inflation, household finances could still come under extra pressure.",
      "Here are seven ways in which you could be affected from 1 April.",
      "1. Water bills",
      "Water bills for households are going up in England and Wales by \u00a310 more per month on average, but there's a lot of variation depending on the company.",
      "For example, the annual Southern Water bill will jump 47% to \u00a3703, while Anglian Water customers will pay 19% more, or \u00a3626.",
      "Factors including whether households have a meter and how much water used will also impact bills, which are being front-loaded for the next five years, meaning the big increase is coming this year.",
      "Water companies in England and Wales have said the increases are needed to invest in creaking infrastructure, including sewage, and to build more reservoirs.",
      "In Scotland, water bills are rising by almost 10%. Scottish Water, which is a public body, said spending was needed to cope with periods of \"drought and intense rainfall\" brought on by climate change.",
      "Domestic customers in Northern Ireland are not billed for water, with the system funded by the devolved government.",
      "How much will I have to pay for my water?",
      "How much will I have to pay for my water?",
      "2. Energy bills",
      "The annual energy bill for a household using a typical amount of gas and electricity is going up by \u00a3111 a year to \u00a31,849 from April.",
      "Regulator Ofgem increased the energy price cap because of higher wholesale costs and inflation.",
      "The cap is set every three months and limits the amount suppliers can charge for each unit of gas and electricity, but not the total bill, so if you use more, you will pay more.",
      "It affects 22 million homes in England, Wales and Scotland.",
      "Standing charges - fixed fees to connect to a gas and electricity supply and vary by region - are rising again for gas but dropping for electricity, but it depends on where you live.",

      "3. Council tax",
      "It is likely the tax you pay to your local authority is going up.",
      "In England, local authorities with responsibility for delivering social care can increase council tax every year by up to 4.99% without triggering a referendum or local vote.",
      "Smaller councils without social care duties can increase bills by up to 2.99%.",
      "For 2025-26, the government is allowing Bradford, Newham, Birmingham, Somerset, and Windsor and Maidenhead to bypass the 4.99% cap, meaning they could raise council tax by more.",
      "Council tax rates in Scotland have been frozen or had limited increases since 2007, but they are are going up, in some cases by as much as 10%.",
      "The Scottish government says it is offering local authorities an extra \u00a31bn in 2025-26 to help reduce the scale of any rise.",
      "In Wales, council tax rates could jump by as much 15% in some areas. Local authorities were given \u00a3253m by the Welsh government in its draft budget, but council leaders say more money needed.",

      "The standard rate of tax for cars registered after April 2017 is rising \u00a35 to \u00a3195 a year. According to the RAC, you may pay less or more if your car was first used before 2017.",
      "The exact amount for your road tax will depend on the year your car was registered and the type of fuel it uses.",
      "One big change is that electric vehicles (EVs) will no longer be tax exempt. EVs registered from April 2025 will pay the lowest rate of \u00a310 in the first year, then move to the standard rate. The standard rate will also apply to EVs first registered after April 2017.",
      "5. Broadband, phone and TV licence",
      "Rule changes introduced by the telecoms regulator this year mean that mobile and broadband providers must now tell customers \"in pounds and pence\" about any price rises, as well as when they occur.",
      "The new rules typically only apply to new customers, so any price rise will depend on when you took your contract out, but prices ususally increase around now.",
      "For instance, under the new rules, someone with a mobile Sim only contract with EE will see their bill go up by \u00a31.50 a month, or \u00a318 a year.",
      "But for the majority of EE customers who took their contract out before 10 April 2024, they will face an increase of 6.4%, which is based on the inflation rate last December together with an additional charge.",
      "Similarly, most Virgin Media broadband customers will face a 7.5% rise in bills, but for anyone who took out a contract after 9 January this year, their monthly bill will go up by \u00a33.50.",
      "The cost of a TV licence is also going up by \u00a35 to \u00a3174.50, and for a black and white TV is going up by \u00a31.50 to \u00a358.50.",
      "6. Stamp duty",

      "First-time buyers currently had paid no stamp duty on homes up to \u00a3425,000, but this is dropping to \u00a3300,000.",

      "7. Hidden tax rises",
      "The government has kept in place the freeze on tax thresholds on income tax and National Insurance until 2028, a policy brought in by the previous government.",
      "This is often dubbed a stealth tax - as governments don't explicitly label it as a tax.",
      "But the policy amounts to a tax rise because of a process called \"fiscal drag\", which sees more people \"dragged\" into paying higher rates of tax as wages rises.",
      "The new tax year begins on 6 April.",
      "According to figures from the government's financial watchdog by 2028-29, nearly four million additional people will be expected to pay income tax - and three million more will have moved to the higher rate - due to the threshold being frozen.",

      "It includes multiple cameras, eye-tracking technologies and electronics that work together to simulate scenarios from high stakes military operations.",
      "\"Everything has to be perfect,\" says the production specialist. \"So many different things can affect other things that can affect the final product in such a massive, massive way.\"",
      "Mr Barrientos works for Varjo, one of a growing number of companies in Finland developing innovations that can assist military forces and governments in preparing for or reacting to conflict.",
      "The Nordic nation, with a population of just five million, has 368 defence tech companies, according to research for Tesi, a state-funded venture capital company, released last September.",
      "Around 40% of these are start-ups and scale-ups, with many growing at rates of 30% to 40% if their tools are dual-use technologies that can also be used in other industries.",
      "Helsinki is now among the top five cities in Europe for defence, security and resilience investments, according to a separate report released in February by tech data platform Dealroom, in collaboration with the Nato Innovation Fund, an independent venture capital fund launched in 2023 with funding from 24 Nato allies.",
      "Varjo says its headsets are being used to provide 80 simulation programmes to Nato forces in the US and Europe.",
      "In simple terms, its products are more advanced versions of the virtual reality headsets used in gaming.",
      "But they combine synthetic artificial content with views of real-world environments.",
      "This \"mixed reality\" experience \"squeezes the training continuum\" for fighter pilots, says the firm's CEO Timo Toikkanen, because they no longer have to travel long distances to complete war simulations in giant aircraft hangers, which are expensive to power and run. \"You can do 99% of the same [training] inside of the headset.\"",
      "The start-up had already attracted heavy investment prior to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, and started working with medical research companies and car manufacturers.",
      "But Mr Toikkanen says the start of the conflict and Finland's admission to Nato a year later \"just kind of put everything on steroids\" in terms of interest in its defence offering.",
      "Since March 2022 the company has raised more than \u20ac50m (\u00a342m; $54m) in additional funding.",
      "Mr Toikkanen says that before the war technologies that could be used by military forces used to be \"kind of a red flag\" for investors concerned about social and environmental responsibilities, and Varjo's executives would \"tiptoe around\" that side of the business when seeking funding.",
      "Now the opposite is now true.",
      "\"Investors are looking for companies that are active in the field of defence technology and it's not frowned upon anymore,\" he explains.",
      "Following President Trump's return to office in January, Mr Toikkanen says there's been a renewed interest in its products from European militaries in the wake of rising geopolitical tensions.",
      "\"Suddenly, there's a new understanding that we need to prepare, and we can't only rely on Nato and the United States for our defence.\"",
      "Listen: Business Daily - Finland's Defence Tech",
      "Other rapidly expanding Finnish start-ups in the defence and dual-use sectors include Iceye, which has developed fine-resolution microsatellite-based imaging and data services, and Re-orbit which supplies satellite software.",
      "Distance Technologies, a start-up backed by Google creates headset-free immersive technologies. In March it announced a collaboration with Patria, a Finnish legacy defence firm, which will trial the tech on its armoured vehicles.",
      "Finland shares around 1,340 km (830 miles) of its border with Russia, and the Finnish government spent a greater proportion of its budget on defence than many other European countries even before the war in Ukraine.",
      "\"There's a phrase I like to leverage, which is 'the tyranny of geography' - the closer you are to a threat, the more likely you are to perceive it as more apparent and indeed more existential,\" says Nicholas Nelson, a UK-based defence tech investor and visiting fellow at the University of Oxford.",
      "\"They also have a memory of the Winter War, which transpired during World War Two, where they were invaded by the Soviet Union.\"",
      "The duty of Finns to defend their country is enshrined in the Finnish constitution, and there is mandatory military service for men.",
      "Mr Nelson believes this exposure may also have encouraged talented citizens to become founders or investors in defence tech, rather than other fast-growing industries in Europe such as renewable energy or financial technologies.",
      "At Maria 01, a former hospital turned startup campus in Helsinki, entrepreneur Janne Heitela opens his laptop to scroll through images of unmanned airships gathering data above snow-covered Arctic forests.",
      "He is the CEO of Kelluu, a company that originally expected its technology to be used by climate researchers, but pivoted to becoming a surveillance platform targeted at cities, governments and research institutions in 2022.",
      "\"It was a very concrete, personal feeling that we need to also do something for the security situation,\" says Mr Heitela.",
      "He highlights national surveys which suggest at least 80% of the Finnish population are prepared to fight for their country, and agrees with Mr Nelson that this \"spirit to be ready to defend\" has trickled into start-up and business strategies, and is likely to fuel the sector's continued growth.",
      "Defence tech companies launching in Finland have also been boosted by a strong general tech scene in the country.",
      "Many of the country's tech alumni \u2013 including Mr Toikkanen at Varjo \u2013 honed their skills at Nokia, the former global mobile phone giant which has its roots in Finland.",
      "It ran into financial difficulties following the launch of Apple's iPhone in the mid-2000s, but this encouraged a sizable number of former employees to launch or invest in new companies.",
      "Although not as mature as other European start-up hubs like Sweden and the UK, Helsinki has spawned a handful of unicorn businesses, worth a billion dollars or more, including sleep and fitness tracking ring Oura and game developer Supercell.",
      "There is also strong state support for the defence tech scene. Last year Business Finland, a government agency that promotes investment and innovation, launched a new defence and digital resilience programme which is directing \u20ac120m towards supporting research and development initiatives from small businesses and startups.",
      "\"Our current government\u2026 they are really enforcing this kind of public-private collaboration,\" says the programme's director Kirsi Kokko. \"I think they understand the urgency.\"",
      "Despite the rapid growth of defence tech in Finland, the sector is facing a range of local and European-wide challenges.",
      "Mr Heitela, the founder of airship technology platform Kelluu, describes something of a \"culture clash\" between agile start-ups and large defence companies and governments that have typically required years of experimentation and prototyping before acquiring new technologies.",
      "\"That's really on the opposite side of the spectrum for start-ups, in which the DNA is that we will fail fast and rapidly, and you don't have every start-up succeed.\"",
      "At Business Finland, Ms Kokko says the Nordic nation is also impacted by strong global competition for the software talent needed to grow defence tech and dual use businesses.",
      "But while Finland's compact size and long dark winters might put off some potential recruitments, she hopes the nation's reputation for innovation, flat working hierarchies and low crime levels can attract employees with the right skill sets - alongside its success in the sector so far.",

      "Globally, Trump's push to deploy tariffs against close trading partners - many of which have average tariff levels similar to America's - has generated anger and bafflement, while drawing warnings from economists about higher prices and other potential economic pain.",
      "Some businesses in the US have echoed those concerns, but Trump's calls for tariffs are also channelling longstanding frustrations many firms have about foreign competition and policies they face abroad.",
      "Smucker's letter was one of hundreds submitted to the White House, seeking to influence the next set of tariffs, expected to be unveiled on 2 April.",
      "Apple farmers raised the big disparity in import duties their fruit faces in countries such as India (50%), Thailand (40%) and Brazil (10%), as well as sanitary rules in countries such as Australia they said unfairly block their exports.",
      "Streaming businesses flagged digital taxes in Canada and Turkey that they said \"unfairly target and discriminate\" against US companies.",
      "The oil and natural gas lobby criticised regulations in Mexico that require partnership with the state-owned oil company and other policies.",
      "The White House itself spotlighted uneven ethanol tariffs in Brazil (18%, compared with 2.5% in the US), car tariffs in Europe (10%, compared with 2.5% in the US) and motorcycles in India (until a few years ago, 100% vs 2.4% in the US).",
      "Trump has suggested that his plan for reciprocal tariffs will help remedy such grievances, pumping up his announcement as \"Liberation Day\".",
      "But even the businesses seeking action on their own issues have expressed hesitation about the president's tariff-first, ask-questions-later strategy, which risks retaliation and a wider trade war.",
      "With 2 April looming, there remains widespread uncertainty about the goals and scope of White House plans, especially as Trump launches more duties.",
      "\"We're going to be nice,\" he said this week, at the same time as he announced potentially devastating tariffs on foreign cars and car parts. \"I think people will be pleasantly surprised.\"",
      "What are tariffs and why is Trump using them?",
      "Is Trump right when he says the US faces unfair trade?",
      "India has already said it would lower its tariffs on motorcycles - an apparent bet that Trump's tariffs are a strategy designed to gain leverage for trade talks.",
      "But analysts warned that those hoping that Trump plans to use his reciprocal tariffs to negotiate changes elsewhere may be disappointed, as the president has also indicated he could be satisfied by simply hitting back.",
      "\"Some days it's about revenge and just equalising things, and other days it's about lowering tariffs and then other days, third days, it's about bringing manufacturing to the United States,\" said William Reinsch, senior adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington think tank.",
      "\"He's used them all at different times - there's not a single thread here that you can rely on.\"",
      "The mismatch between the blunt tool of tariffs and the more niche issues firms want the White House to champion has led to a delicate dance, as businesses suggest tariffs in their own interest, while also hoping to avoid the repercussions of the kind of sweeping duties that Trump has suggested might be on the table.",
      "For example, steel manufacturer NorthStar BlueScope Steel, which employs 700 people in the US melting steel from recycled metal, urged Trump to expand tariffs on steel and aluminium to parts.",
      "At the same time, however, it asked for an exemption for the raw materials it needs, such as scrap metal.",
      "Likewise, the lobby group for JM Smucker and other big food manufacturers, the Consumer Brands Association, warned against \"overly broad and sweeping tariffs\" that might end up making it more expensive for its members to import ingredients like cocoa, which are not made in the US.",
      "\"I don't necessarily want the current administration to say, well, we'll impose a tariff,\" Tom Madrecki, the group's vice president of supply chain resiliency, said at a recent forum about tariffs, hosted by Farmers for Free Trade.",
      "\"It's this careful balance between yes, I want you to take an America First trade policy and action to counter unfair trade policies abroad... but maybe not quite in that way.\"",
      "Wilbur Ross, who served as Trump's commerce secretary in his first term, said he thought business worries would dissipate as Trump's plans become clear, calling 2 April a \"big step\".",
      "But he noted that the president saw little downside to using tariffs, viewing them as either a source of new revenue, or a way to reduce imports and encourage more manufacturing.",
      "\"He's very committed,\" Ross said. \"People should have known that something like this was coming because he's been talking about it for many, many years.\"",
      "Republicans, traditionally the pro-trade party, have stayed supportive of Trump's strategy, even as tariff announcements have been blamed for the recent stock market sell-off and weakness in recent surveys of business and consumer confidence.",
      "At a recent hearing on trade, Representative Jodey Arrington, a Republican who represents Texas, acknowledged that there might be \"some pain associated on the front end\", but maintained Trump's focus on the issue would create opportunities for his constituents in the end.",
      "\"It just seems to me that it's un-American to not fight for our American manufacturers, producers and workers to simply have an even playing field,\" he said.",
      "\"We're simply attempting... to reset those relationships such that we're playing by the same set of rules,\" he added. \"Then everyone wins.\""

      "Investors sold off shares of carmakers in Japan, Germany and the UK on Thursday, wiping billions of value off names such as Toyota, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.",
      "Firms in America were some of the hardest hit, with General Motors down more than 7%.",

      "\"The major takeaway I think people should know about this is no vehicle is 100% US-made,\" he said.",

      "Ferrari, which ships its cars from Italy, immediately announced a 10% price hike, to help cover the new cost of the duty.",
      "As companies are forced to respond to the 25% tariffs, by raising prices or accepting lower profits, some may decide to pull some models out of the US entirely, leading to fewer choices for American consumers, warned Patrick Anderson, chief executive of the Anderson Economic Group.",
      "This could also lead to carmakers without a current large manufacturing presence in the US, such as Jaguar Land Rover or Porsche, reducing production in their home countries, potentially affecting jobs.",
      "All Mitsubishi cars sold in the US are imported, while Hyundai, which announced plans for a plant in the US earlier this week, ships most of its cars from South Korea.",
      "Trump, who started discussing tariffs on cars in his first term, said his latest tariff enforcement would be permanent, claiming it will boost America's manufacturing base.",

      "Over the past year, Bluesky has gained tens of millions of new users, often at the expense of X.",
      "Apart from just timing, though, BlueSky's success can be largely attributed to its novel architecture, which pairs an X-like experience with a high degree of customization.",
      "Unlike centralized systems, where social media companies have complete control over content and identities, Bluesky users can choose how their feeds are moderated, and what kind of posts the algorithm recommends to them, thanks to the hundreds of options offered by both Bluesky and the community.",
      "Don't like the broader discourse on Bluesky? Jump on the \"popular with friends\" feed to see what the people you follow specifically are talking about.",
      "It will not be simple for Bluesky to scale up to the size of X and Facebook, says Andy Tattersall, an information specialist at the University of Sheffield.",
      "He ways it will have to strike a balance between \"generating revenue, keeping users safe, and moderating content, which is much easier said than done\".",

      "It's backed some notable names, including musician Brian Eno and actor Mark Ruffalo, and plans to raise $30m (\u00a323m) over the next three years to support an open social media ecosystem powered by the AT Protocol, the decentralized network powering Bluesky.",
      "\"Bluesky has created a strong foundation for shared social media infrastructure,\" says Robin Berjon, one of Free Our Feeds' nine custodians, \"but so long as they are the primary operator of this infrastructure the risk remains that it will stop operating in the public interest\".",
      "A bigger worry for these emerging platforms, though, is the network barrier. This can be summed up with Metcalfe's Law, explains Evan Prodromou, co-author and current editor of ActivityPub, another open social media architecture, which is behind popular platforms like Meta's Threads.",
      "The law states that the value of a network goes up with the square of the number of users. That means that bigger social networks have way more resources than smaller ones. They can use those resources to get bigger and bigger and crowd out smaller social media services.",
      "Non-profits like Free Our Feeds and the Social Web Foundation, which Mr Prodromou heads, have a strategy that they hope will help them overcome that Metcalfe's Law.",
      "They hope to replace the current situation, where users of social media hop between their favourite services.",
      "Instead Social Web Foundation is developing a platform which can offer content from all of them.",
      "Threads for example supports a protocol called ActivityPub, which makes it easier to combine services with other social media firms that use that protocol - like Mastodon for instance.",
      "Using this kind of interoperability, Mr Prodromou hopes that services like Social Web Foundation will provide the same value as giant, monolithic platforms.",
      "It's not straightforward, as not all social media firms support the same protocol, for example, BlueSky uses the AT Protocol.",
      "But there are workarounds to that problem, and Free Our Feeds and Social Web Foundation are also working on ways to aggregate sites that use different tech.",
      "\"One thing we've learnt from the past decades is that the last thing the world needs is a one-size-fits all solution for eight billion people,\" says Mr Berjon.",
      "At the other end of the spectrum are those that want to carve a niche out for themselves, rather than replace the incumbents.",
      "In the last couple of years, a cottage industry of unique, new social apps has cropped.",
      "One of those is Mozi, created by Twitter co-founder Ev Williams. Mozi doesn't want you to socialise online at all.",
      "Instead it informs you when you're going to be in the same place (city or event) as someone you know and encourages you to connect with people more often in person.",
      "\"Until Mozi, no combination of apps could tell me what city my friends are in at any given time, or even what my friends locally are up to,\" says Mozi co-founder, Molly DeWolf Swenson.",
      "Mike McCue, the CEO of Flipboard, is convinced such innovation will result in a new era of social networking, where numerous new, more interesting types of social networks will emerge and offer people more choices.",

      "\"In the end,\" says Mr McCue, \"it's unlikely one service will replace the Facebook or Twitter we once knew, but instead several services will start to take our time away from these old-style single feed experiences, our behaviours will shift with these new choices and new generations will expect more.\"",

      "On the face of it, that sounds like a good thing. So why are people saying that she may struggle to meet them and the only way she may do so is by raising taxes?",
      "It's a complicated picture, but there are essentially five steps to get from where we are now to tax rises.",
      "Not much spare money",
      "Ahead of the Spring Statement, the chancellor had been under pressure, with speculation over how she would be able to meet her self-imposed financial rules, one of which is to not borrow to fund day-to-day spending.",

      "\"All forecasts turn out to be wrong. Weather forecasts also turn out to be wrong,\" says Mr Hughes.",

      "According to the OBR, these import taxes would have a direct impact on goods totalling around 0.2% of GDP.",
      "Before Trump's announcement, the OBR had warned of the risk of an escalating trade war, and while the proposals do not exactly match the watchdog's worst-case scenario, which would see the UK retaliate, Hughes said it had elements of it.",

      "This is a form of financing pegged to a set of annual environmental and social improvements agreed between a borrower and its banks.",
      "Gothenburg's four target areas are efforts to make renewable energy the sole source of the city's heat production, making the council's own vehicle fleet electric, reducing energy usage in municipality-owned buildings, such as hospitals and schools, and improving the city's poorest neighbourhoods.",

      "In 2022 and 2023 Gothenburg managed to avoid a financial penalty, but the newly released figures for 2024 show that it missed its target for switching to renewable energy. And so it is about to be fined 150,000 kroner.",
      "However, this is offset by the discounts it is getting for continuing to hit improvement levels for energy usage and social improvement. For electrifying the council's vehicles, while it missed its improvement goal, it didn't do so by enough to be fined.",

    "story": [
      "Imagine an electric drone mixed with a fixed wing plane - that is the concept behind a new two-seater aircraft being developed by start-up company, Skyfly.",
      "The Axe promises the flexibility of a helicopter but without the cost, noise pollution or carbon emissions.",
      "It is a vertically capable aircraft, or Electric Vertical Take-off and Landing (eVTOL) aircraft, which means it can take off like a helicopter.",
      "It also has two fixed wings that allows it to take off and land from a runway.",
      "The company claims the Axe has a top speed of 100mph, it can carry up to 172kg - approximately the weight of two 13.5st adults - and has a range of 100 miles, about the distance from Oxford to the Isle of Wight.",
      "The team, based near Banbury in Oxfordshire, has taken five years to fine tune the design.",
      "\"Compared to a conventional aircraft it's got eight motors which is very strange,\" says Dr Bill Brooks, Skyfly's chief technical engineer.",
      "\"And it's a tail-first layout called a canard so it's got the tail at the front.  The all up weight is 750kg but 240kg of that are batteries so all the structure is carbon fibre to keep it as light as possible,\" Dr Brooks says.",
      "Safety is an important part of the design too.",
      "'Environmental benefits'",
      "The large wings help it to glide in the event of power failure and there are two motors at the end of each wing so that if one fails the other can compensate.",
      "It is also equipped with an emergency ballistic parachute to bring the aircraft and passengers down safely.",
      "As well as being safer and cleaner than conventional aircraft, Michael Thompson, Skyfly's chief executive, says electric models are significantly quieter too.",
      "\"When you're taking off, you're no longer annoying everyone around you from a noise perspective, so I do think electric propulsion brings not only environmental benefits but from a noise pollution point of view, it's a huge benefit as well,\" he says.",
      "Who is it marketed at?",
      "Other eVTOLs under development include those looking to provide an electric flying-taxi service like Bristol-based Vertical Aerospace (VA) .",
      "VA, as well as Archer and Joby in the US, are designing electric powered aircraft to carry up to four passengers.",
      "Skyfly's Axe, by comparison, is more compact and aimed at the private market.",
      "The do-it-youself kit-plane comes with a price tag of \u00a3250,000.",
      "It is aimed at existing pilots who want to transition away from diesel piston engines.",
      "Jason Pritchard, executive editor of eVTOL Insights, says it is also likely to appeal to flying clubs in order to train new members:",
      "\"The eVTOL aircraft industry is still in its infancy with initial operations a few years away, but it also needs to train large numbers of pilots in the coming years,\" he says.",
      "\"Additionally, the Axe's design can also train pilots with the skills and controls necessary to land an aircraft without power, which is a necessary tool.\"",
      "What about charging infrastructure?",
      "While the Axe can be charged up overnight with a conventional three-pin plug, just like EV cars, electric aircraft will need the charging infrastructure to be scaled up.",
      "Aerovolt, based in West Sussex, has installed rapid chargers at seven UK airports with 40 more in the pipeline.",
      "Its founder, Philip Kingsley-Dobson, says demand is growing.",
      "\"A lot of piston aircraft can't use leaded fuel in the future so they're looking for alternatives and ways we can decarbonise the lower end of aviation,\" he says.",
      "'Cutting edge'",
      "There are no eVTOL aircraft currently permitted to fly in the UK.",
      "Skyfly's Axe has successfully completed manned test flights in both hover and forward flight modes but still needs to be certified by the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA).",
      "With 40 pre-orders from buyers all over the world, the company hopes to deliver the new model to customers early next year.",

      "At another, an elderly couple chat over a hot meal, while a queue of customers steadily forms at the till.",
      "But this is one of 52 cafes set to close - including others in London, Leeds, Portsmouth and Glasgow - announced this week in a cost-cutting drive that the supermarket chain says is designed to \"renew and reinvigorate Morrisons\" and focus \"investment into the areas that customers really value\".",
      "That came two months after Sainsbury's said it was closing all 61 of its supermarket cafes.",
      "While some see the decline of supermarket cafes as inevitable, shoppers around the country have told BBC News that these cafes give them a cheap, convenient and welcoming place to get a warm meal while catching up with friends.",
      "'Share a meal without the stress of cooking'",
      "Regulars at the Morrisons cafe in Queensbury say they're surprised - and saddened - to hear it's closing.",

      "Morrisons says 344 of its cafes will remain open despite the planned closures but, according to its chief executive Rami Baiti\u00e9h, \"a minority have specific local challenges and in those locations, regrettably, closure and re-allocation of the space is the only sensible option\".",
      "Elsewhere in the country, Ben Hopkins, 32, feels his local Morrisons cafe in Meltham, West Yorkshire, is bustling every time he goes because \"the food is typical of that you'd get in a traditional greasy spoon\".",
      "Such outlets can come in handy for parents, too. Lisa Clavering, from St Albans, says she relied on Asda and Morrisons cafes for a \"quick and cheap hot lunch\" when her two sons were younger.",
      "\"As they grew, it was somewhere we could go together and share a meal without the stress of cooking it and cleaning up, where I didn't feel judged by other customers if they made a noise,\" the 42-year-old says.",
      "Lisa says part of the appeal of supermarket cafes is that they feel accessible - a \"warm and welcoming place with no fuss and no surprises\".",
      "\"I do worry that once they go, there's not really a like-for-like to replace them, and other alternatives are typically much more expensive,\" Lisa says.",
      "'Should come as no surprise'",
      "But other people question the need for supermarket cafes, pointing to changes in people's shopping habits and the growing competition from high-street coffee chains.",

      "\"The grocers are desperately trying to navigate significant cost headwinds, while simultaneously competing with discounters like Aldi and Lidl.",
      "\"This is a low-margin industry, so supermarkets need to be utterly ruthless when it comes to cost-cutting.\"",
      "When shoppers come into larger supermarkets, they \"want low prices and they want a frictionless experience. In-store cafes work in certain locations, but they're simply not essential for most stores,\" Ms Berg says.",
      "It largely echoes the reasoning Sainsbury's has given for its closures - that \"the majority of [its] most loyal shoppers do not use the cafes regularly\".",

      "\"If you go back to the beginning of the last century there were an awful lot of motor companies, and it was clear that automobiles were going to make a huge difference,\" says Prof Dimson. \"But almost every company went bankrupt, you didn't know which company you should be buying.\"",
      "Then, of course, not all high-tech businesses are making money. The measure of the return on an investment in shares uses two factors, the growth in profits or dividends, and the growth in the value of the shares.",
      "Boring companies might pay reliable dividends and see their shares gradually increase in value. But many high-tech companies are not paying out much if anything in dividends. Instead, they are investing in future growth, and so their share prices fluctuate based on hopes of future profits.",
      "As Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at UK financial services firm Hargreaves Lansdown, puts it: \"Tech shares are more volatile, they have high valuations and their price-earnings ratios are very high, and growth stocks are more sensitive to interest rate movements.\"",
      "But also, investors in such shares are, as Ms Streeter puts it, gambling on \"not jam today but jam tomorrow\". They are all trying to pick the next future big winner, not the one paying out profits now, but the one that will eventually pay huge dividends sometime in the future.",
      "So, any news or even suggestion that future growth is not going to be as good as previously expected means share values can collapse.",
      "On the other hand, any good news boosts share prices even if current profits, or even losses, don't change at all, as investors pile into what they think is the future winner. The shares are more volatile because they are not underwritten by current profits or dividends.",
      "That means as Prof Dimson puts it, \"that small changes in growth expectation can lead to large changes in share value\", which can effect a large number of companies at the same time.",
      "\"You have companies that are reasonably similar, so when growth rates change it is effecting quite a few companies in a similar way,\" he says.",
      "\"This is not different from the dotcom boom at the beginning of the 2000s. There were companies with huge growth prospects. And when the growth prospects disappeared, these were the companies that disappeared.\"",
      "Also, even today there are not that many really large high-tech companies. In America they are colloquially known as the \"magnificent seven\" - Nvidia, a chipmaker, Alphabet, which owns Google, Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, Meta, the parent of Facebook, and Tesla.",
      "So, it does not take much to spook the market, especially since several of these firms are really quite young, and are dominant in sectors where previous leaders have crashed and burned. Anyone remember Ericsson, Boo or Compaq?",
      "Technology, unlike say steel production or food manufacturing, is changing at a very rapid rate, and there is obviously the chance that a new high-tech company will come along and destroy the business model of its most established rivals.",
      "There is simply no guarantee that today's \"magnificent seven\" will remain magnificent or even stay as the same seven firms.",
      "Take Tesla for example, its sales have recently fallen in response to two widely-reported factors. Firstly, some potential customers are opposed to Tesla owner Elon Musk's involvement in President Trump's government. And secondly, Chinese electric car firms such as BYD are increasingly strong competitors.",
      "Meanwhile, Nvidia saw its share price drop sharply at the start of this year following the release of Chinese artificial intelligence chatbot DeepSeek.  This app was reportedly created at a fraction of the cost of its rivals.",
      "The instant popularity of DeepSeek has raised questions about the future of America's AI dominance and the scale of investments US firms are planning. This concerns Nvidia because it is at the forefront of making microchips for AI processing.",
      "AI is now the biggest tech game in town, and it seems that absolutely everyone is claiming that AI is transforming their industry, their products and their profits. They can't all be right.",
      "Or as Prof Dimon puts it: \"At least in 1910 you knew what automobiles did, but today with AI companies you have to rely on the wisdom of the crowd, and for AI companies that isn't good enough.\"",
      "And not all AI firms can win, adds Robert Whaley, professor of finance at Vanderbilt University in Tennessee. \"AI is certainly contributing to tech volatility. The race is on.\"",
      "That means that AI shares are sensitive to predictions. And any sign that a particular firm is lagging in the AI race may mean that lots of investors, most of whom don't understand the subject, abandon it for another that seems to be further ahead.",
      "Then there are investors who seemingly don't seem to care which companies' shares they buy, so long as they are in the \"booming\" high-tech sector, as they are speculating and spreading their risks.",
      "In short, share prices are not always a rational measure of a firm's value, especially in the high-tech sector, or even of its prospects. Instead, they can represent the optimism of investors. And optimism does not always last.",
      "It is often short-lived, passing, and faddish. And sometimes optimism comes face to face with reality or just plain fades away. It is, in short, volatile.",

      "The exact amount you pay will depend on your individual circumstances and where you live.",
      "Although minimum wages are also increasing, and wages on average have been outpacing inflation, household finances could still come under extra pressure.",
      "Here are seven ways in which you could be affected from 1 April.",
      "1. Water bills",
      "Water bills for households are going up in England and Wales by \u00a310 more per month on average, but there's a lot of variation depending on the company.",
      "For example, the annual Southern Water bill will jump 47% to \u00a3703, while Anglian Water customers will pay 19% more, or \u00a3626.",
      "Factors including whether households have a meter and how much water used will also impact bills, which are being front-loaded for the next five years, meaning the big increase is coming this year.",
      "Water companies in England and Wales have said the increases are needed to invest in creaking infrastructure, including sewage, and to build more reservoirs.",
      "In Scotland, water bills are rising by almost 10%. Scottish Water, which is a public body, said spending was needed to cope with periods of \"drought and intense rainfall\" brought on by climate change.",
      "Domestic customers in Northern Ireland are not billed for water, with the system funded by the devolved government.",
      "How much will I have to pay for my water?",
      "How much will I have to pay for my water?",
      "2. Energy bills",
      "The annual energy bill for a household using a typical amount of gas and electricity is going up by \u00a3111 a year to \u00a31,849 from April.",
      "Regulator Ofgem increased the energy price cap because of higher wholesale costs and inflation.",
      "The cap is set every three months and limits the amount suppliers can charge for each unit of gas and electricity, but not the total bill, so if you use more, you will pay more.",
      "It affects 22 million homes in England, Wales and Scotland.",
      "Standing charges - fixed fees to connect to a gas and electricity supply and vary by region - are rising again for gas but dropping for electricity, but it depends on where you live.",
      "Ofgem is suggesting households consider a fixed tariff for a bit of stability.",
      "Energy price cap: Why are gas and electricity bills going up and can I fix?",
      "Energy price cap: Why are gas and electricity bills going up and can I fix?",
      "3. Council tax",
      "It is likely the tax you pay to your local authority is going up.",
      "In England, local authorities with responsibility for delivering social care can increase council tax every year by up to 4.99% without triggering a referendum or local vote.",
      "Smaller councils without social care duties can increase bills by up to 2.99%.",
      "For 2025-26, the government is allowing Bradford, Newham, Birmingham, Somerset, and Windsor and Maidenhead to bypass the 4.99% cap, meaning they could raise council tax by more.",
      "Council tax rates in Scotland have been frozen or had limited increases since 2007, but they are are going up, in some cases by as much as 10%.",
      "The Scottish government says it is offering local authorities an extra \u00a31bn in 2025-26 to help reduce the scale of any rise.",
      "In Wales, council tax rates could jump by as much 15% in some areas. Local authorities were given \u00a3253m by the Welsh government in its draft budget, but council leaders say more money needed.",
      "Northern Ireland uses a domestic rates system instead of council tax. All of Northern Ireland's councils have reported district rate increases for the next year.",
      "What is council tax and how much is it going up?",
      "What is council tax and how much is it going up?",
      "4. Car tax",
      "The standard rate of tax for cars registered after April 2017 is rising \u00a35 to \u00a3195 a year. According to the RAC, you may pay less or more if your car was first used before 2017.",
      "The exact amount for your road tax will depend on the year your car was registered and the type of fuel it uses.",
      "One big change is that electric vehicles (EVs) will no longer be tax exempt. EVs registered from April 2025 will pay the lowest rate of \u00a310 in the first year, then move to the standard rate. The standard rate will also apply to EVs first registered after April 2017.",
      "5. Broadband, phone and TV licence",
      "Rule changes introduced by the telecoms regulator this year mean that mobile and broadband providers must now tell customers \"in pounds and pence\" about any price rises, as well as when they occur.",
      "The new rules typically only apply to new customers, so any price rise will depend on when you took your contract out, but prices ususally increase around now.",
      "For instance, under the new rules, someone with a mobile Sim only contract with EE will see their bill go up by \u00a31.50 a month, or \u00a318 a year.",
      "But for the majority of EE customers who took their contract out before 10 April 2024, they will face an increase of 6.4%, which is based on the inflation rate last December together with an additional charge.",
      "Similarly, most Virgin Media broadband customers will face a 7.5% rise in bills, but for anyone who took out a contract after 9 January this year, their monthly bill will go up by \u00a33.50.",
      "The cost of a TV licence is also going up by \u00a35 to \u00a3174.50, and for a black and white TV is going up by \u00a31.50 to \u00a358.50.",
      "6. Stamp duty",
      "House buyers in England and Northern Ireland will start paying stamp duty on properties over \u00a3125,000, instead of over \u00a3250,000.",
      "First-time buyers currently had paid no stamp duty on homes up to \u00a3425,000, but this is dropping to \u00a3300,000.",

      "What is stamp duty land tax and how is it changing?",
      "7. Hidden tax rises",
      "The government has kept in place the freeze on tax thresholds on income tax and National Insurance until 2028, a policy brought in by the previous government.",
      "This is often dubbed a stealth tax - as governments don't explicitly label it as a tax.",
      "But the policy amounts to a tax rise because of a process called \"fiscal drag\", which sees more people \"dragged\" into paying higher rates of tax as wages rises.",
      "The new tax year begins on 6 April.",
      "According to figures from the government's financial watchdog by 2028-29, nearly four million additional people will be expected to pay income tax - and three million more will have moved to the higher rate - due to the threshold being frozen.",

      "There is nothing much you can do if your council tax is increasing, or you are buying a house and facing a higher stamp duty bill.",

      "The seven bills going up in April",
      "The seven bills going up in April",
      "1. Shop around",
      "For some services you can often get a better deal simply by calling the company you are with and saying you are considering leaving.",
      "\"Shop around for better deals, and haggle with your existing provider,\" says Alice Haine, from professional services group Evelyn Partners.",
      "\"It's always worth haggling. Haggle for everything.\"",
      "That applies to a whole range of bills, including insurance, energy, and broadband.",
      "\"Our research shows that switching providers if you're out of contract can slash broadband, pay TV and mobile bills by up to \u00a3235,\" says Emily Seymour, from consumer group Which?",
      "Gas and electricity are often the biggest bills people face and the price cap set by the regulator is rising by 6%, so it is worth finding the best deal for you.",
      "That may include choosing a fixed rate deal, says Ms Seymour. If you charge an electric vehicle or use appliances overnight, look for a deal with a cheaper night tariff.",
      "\"We'd also recommend taking a meter reading as close to 31 March as possible to ensure you're billed the correct amount for your energy usage,\" she says.",
      "2. Cut back",
      "One surefire way to keep your bills down is to reduce what you use.",
      "Taking shorter showers and putting in a showerhead with a slower flow will save money on your water and energy bills.",
      "\"You have to treat water as an expensive resource,\" Ms Haine says.",
      "Getting a water meter fitted may save you money, she adds.",
      "Smart meters for electricity and gas can also help you keep tabs on what is pushing up your energy bills most, the Energy Saving Trust says.",
      "The trust advises draught-proofing your home, including round floorboards, pipework and old extractor fans, and setting the thermostat to the lowest comfortable temperature. For most people, it says, that is between 18\u00b0C and 21\u00b0C.",
      "MoneySavingExpert says you can save money by using the principle: \"heat the human, not the home\". Using hot water bottles and electric blankets should work out cheaper than turning up the radiators.",
      "You can also change the settings on combi or conventional boilers to save money, says Martin Lewis at MoneySavingExpert.",
      "When it comes to transport bills, you can't avoid the vehicle tax rise unless you ditch the car altogether.",
      "But if you are taking the train it is also worth checking whether a railcard will help, points out Ms Seymour.",
      "\"To cut costs on rail fares, we'd recommend booking tickets in advance and splitting fares where possible,\" she says.",
      "3. Get help",
      "If you are struggling to pay your household bills, don't panic, says Richard Lane, chief client officer at the StepChange Debt Charity. He suggests creating a detailed budget that captures all your income and expenditure.",
      "\"This will allow you to get a clear picture of your finances and see how much you have leftover to pay toward any debts or make savings,\" he says.",
      "Then check what support you are entitled to.",
      "Water companies offer lower \"social\" and hardship tariffs for people on very low incomes, so it is worth calling your provider. People claiming benefits can often also get lower tariffs for broadband.",
      "\"These organisations have a regulatory responsibility to treat customers fairly and will be able to offer you tailored support,\" Mr Lane added.",
      "There is the government's Warm Home Discount, for people with high energy costs on a very low income, including Pension Credit. And people on low incomes are also eligible for a reduction in council tax.",
      "Check if you qualify for a free TV licence. If you are over 75 and on Pension Credit or live with someone who is, then you will.",
      "You may also be able to boost your income. Check which benefits you are entitled to on the independent MoneyHelper website, backed by the government, or using benefits calculators run by Policy in Practice and charities Entitledto and Turn2us.",
      "If you are struggling with debt here are some other organisations that may be able to help."

    "published": "Fri, 28 Mar 2025 00:00:13 GMT",
    "summary": "Why the reign of the free market is facing its biggest ever challenge",
    "story": [
      "I remember 1974 well. With inflation on the rise, the government had been locked in battle with trade unions over worker pay. The government appeared paralysed: stand up to the miners and strikes could shut down the power system, but give in and pay them more money and inflation would rocket.",
      "And then the global oil crisis came out of nowhere. It threw economies, including Britain's, into chaos. The government introduced a three-day week. Power cuts were common - we would be plunged into darkness without warning. And seemingly, the government just expected us to deal with it.",
      "This was also the year I began presenting the BBC's current affairs programme Panorama. We spent a lot of time debating these issues. People came on with all kinds of different ideas of what to do.",
      "There were even suggestions that what the country really needed to take back control from the unions was a military takeover - a coup.",
      "There was another idea out there too. It was proposed by the Conservative politician Keith Joseph and was entirely radical - so removed from the mainstream, in fact, that during filming of Panorama, Joseph turned to the production team and asked exasperatedly if they understood what he meant.",
      "That idea was the free market.",
      "This meant Britain departing from the post World War Two consensus that government should control the economy and that instead if you left the markets alone, they would deliver the country greater prosperity and security.",
      "If, in 2025, the idea sounds anything but radical, that's exactly the point.",
      "What we saw in the UK in the 1980s under Margaret Thatcher's government was just how quickly the free market transitioned from a radical idea into the new reality. Then before long it became what many assumed was the system that would last forever.",
      "US President Donald Trump is a billionaire businessman who has clearly done well financially out of capitalism. But suddenly, thanks in part to him, the free market system finds itself under assault like never before.",
      "It might yet weather the storm. However others are asking, is the free market system fatally flawed and doomed to failure?",
      "The fantasy world of Thatcher's Britain",
      "So much of what Thatcher did in the wake of her 1983 general election victory seems so obvious now. We take it for granted that private companies play a pivotal role in providing our water, electricity, gas, railways, ports and freight.",
      "But at the time few believed it possible to do what she had done - it seemed like a fantasy world, completely detached from how things had been done post war.",
      "I was six when the war ended. There was rationing \u2013 coupons that allowed you to buy meat or clothes, or of course, sweets. But out of these hard times and on the heels of victory, a new vision of society was emerging in Britain.",
      "With Clement Attlee's landslide election victory in July 1945, for the first time in Britain's political history a majority cast their votes for a party ostensibly dedicated to socialism.",
      "But more than that, a new consensus on how the country should run emerged, with those leading the Labour and Conservative parties singing from a broadly similar sheet.",
      "\"We have built our defences against want and sickness, and we're proud of it,\" was uttered not by a Labour prime minister but by Harold Macmillan, Conservative prime minister from 1957 to 1963. This had been how things were done.",
      "However not everyone bought into the consensus. Antony Fisher, who was a chicken farmer, was exasperated by what he saw as the meddling of the Egg Marketing Board. He set up the Institute of Economic Affairs think tank, inspired Keith Joseph and he in turn got Thatcher's ear.",
      "Trump's admiration of Thatcher",
      "That the current assault on the free market is coming, in part, from a Republican US president seems all the more ironic given how popular Thatcher's reforms were with the American right.",
      "Thatcher and President Ronald Reagan shared a similar world view, and Trump has spoken of his admiration for the two, albeit with the caveat that he didn't agree with some of Reagan's trade policies.",
      "Thatcher was convinced that the country would be much better off if gas and water and electricity were taken out of the hands of the state. And sold on the open market. The free market. Just like buying a loaf of bread.",
      "The Thatcher government's big idea was that they weren't just going to sell the shares in state-owned utilities to big businesses or investors. They were going to offer them to the British people.",
      "In December 1984 shares in British Telecom (BT) went on sale. The next morning, the numbers were staggering: more than two million Britons were now BT shareholders.",
      "And Thatcher began to realise that selling off these companies wasn't just about breaking the shackles of government control. It could be something bigger - turning every person in Britain into a capitalist and in doing so making capitalism popular.",
      "In Britain, by the end of the 1980s, the scale of transformation was staggering. The sum of \u00a360bn was raised by selling off state run companies. Up to 15 million Britons were now shareholders.",
      "Britain was embracing the free market. This wasn't just an economic shift. It was a cultural revolution. A redefinition of Britain's relationship with money, with government, and with itself.",
      "And if Thatcher's privatisation had given ordinary people the chance to buy shares, her reforms to Britain's financial services sector in 1986, known as the Big Bang, gave ordinary people the chance to sell them too, to get a job in the previously closed world of the City.",
      "There were many on the left for whom the principle alone of these reforms was something to object to. The assault on the free market from some on the right is not about the principles of the reforms, but the consequences.",
      "Offshore business and collapsing communities",
      "At the core of Thatcher's thinking was a belief that free market capitalism could work only if many people had a direct stake in it. And with share ownership of previously state run utilities, many people did. But before long, alarm bells were starting to be rung. And their chime has only gotten louder.",
      "James Goldsmith was a businessman who had made a fortune by buying struggling companies cheaply, reshaping them to maximise efficiency and then selling them at a profit. The 1980s reforms were like manna from heaven for him.",
      "But then he seemed to change his mind about things. In 1994 he told a committee of US senators that its premise contained a fatal flaw - that the system demanded maximum profit but to achieve maximum profit that meant severing the umbilical link with many of your own electorate.",
      "\"You get to a system whereby, to get the best corporate profits, you have to leave your own country. You have to say to your own sales force 'Goodbye, we can't use you anymore - you're too expensive'.",
      "\"You've got unions. You want holidays. You want protection. So we're going offshore.\"",
      "Goldsmith was predicting that companies would take their business wherever they would make the most money. If you are a CEO answerable to shareholders that's literally your job description. And the result, he said, would be job losses in the West, with communities collapsing.",
      "And to make things worse, he argued that Britain had ceded sovereignty to the likes of the European Union and the World Trade Organization, with Britain binding itself to an economic system run by unelected bureaucrats in Brussels, only adding to the sense of alienation felt in collapsing communities. And with global markets dictating policy. If an industry wasn't profitable, it was left to die.",
      "Today, the UK may be a global leader in science and financial services but is that of much consolation to communities where we once made things that are now made offshore?",
      "Based on what I often heard in my many years touring the country presenting Question Time, I'm not sure it is.",
      "Goldsmith would end up trying to go into politics. His Referendum Party was trounced in the 1997 general election but he had planted a seed. He had argued that the global free market path that Britain and the rest of the world was going down was dangerous. That it would spread division around the world.",
      "Fast-forward nearly 20 years to 2016 and his warning came to pass. Britain voted to leave the European Union and the verdict could not be clearer: the Leave vote was highest in those left-behind communities, seemingly fuelled by those who felt globalisation was not working for them.",
      "The dream of a nation of shareholders has soured too.",
      "In 1989 Thames Water was privatised. We were promised lower bills, better infrastructure, less red tape and investment in a system fraying at the edges. It was investment that the global capitalist system was supposedly best placed to provide.",
      "What followed was something else entirely. Debt ballooned and dividends flowed to shareholders. The company extracted profit while pipes leaked and sewage poured into rivers. And our bills now pay for interest on that debt - it feels like we've come a long way from Thatcher's nation of shareholders.",
      "Trump's tariffs 'defy easy explanation'",
      "Back in 1994, James Goldsmith had posited that the problem with the free market dream was that it didn't protect the home base.",
      "Now, there is someone else much more powerful who takes that view.",
      "President Trump's methods are so erratic that with him it's hard to tell what is going on. His readiness to slap hugely consequential tariffs on countries that are both traditional foes and supposed friends at times defies easy explanation.",
      "But what we can say is that he is trying to return to ideas that preceded the free market. He is trying to make America strong through protectionism, making it harder for anyone to simply sell anywhere.",
      "There is an argument that if you take the long view then perhaps the free market period is the outlier. Britain itself had a long, long period of protectionism before it embraced free trade.",
      "Tariffs are nothing new in world economic history and in a sense Trump is just trying to return the US to how things were, albeit in quite a chaotic way.",
      "The reign of the free market is facing its biggest ever challenge. But that challenge is coming not from supporters of socialism who ideologically back a big role for the state. Instead, the challenge is coming from Trump, a man who is broadly speaking of the right and has no qualms with capitalism allowing people to become very rich.",

      "Regulator Ofgem increased the energy price cap because of higher wholesale costs and inflation.",

      "However, everything changed in 2020 when John was diagnosed with dementia.",
      "The condition caused a personality change, and John became delusional and paranoid. He started to accuse Barbara and his own brother Desmond of plotting against him.",
      "Following a collapse at home John was taken to hospital, where - because of Covid restrictions - nobody was allowed to visit.",
      "This isolation fed John's feelings of paranoia, and the suspicion that he had been abandoned by his family.",
      "It was during this time that John's eldest granddaughter, Amy - the one person he still seemed to trust - began to take charge of his life.",
      "At first, no-one in the family was suspicious. John had always been close to Amy.",
      "Unknown to them, John had requested and signed a form banning contact between anyone involved in his care and anyone in his family, apart from Amy.",
      "Even though his medical notes describe him as paranoid and delusional, John was declared as having \"mental capacity\" - this was significant because it meant he could legally grant someone lasting power of attorney over his finances.",
      "Barbara says her efforts to raise concerns with social services were blanked: \"They just didn't want to know. They weren't interested in the letters that we wrote.\"",
      "After three months in hospital, John was discharged into Amy's care. She suggested he could recuperate at a care home at Paignton in Devon, near where she lived, while she readied her house for him to stay there.",
      "At this stage, the other family members thought this was just a temporary arrangement in everyone's best interests. Amy said that it was what John wanted, and it would be a respite for Barbara.",
      "However, Barbara recalls: \"As soon as she got him down there, the vitriol started.\" Amy told the rest of the family they no longer had any say about John's welfare, and they were not to try to contact him.",
      "In response to their pleas, it was agreed that a niece of John's would call him once a week to check that he was alright.",

      "The family discovered that John had signed an LPA document giving Amy power of attorney over all his property and finances.",
      "Meanwhile, a solicitor in Devon contacted Barbara asking about their home and joint assets. Barbara later found out about John's new will, which named Amy as the sole beneficiary.",
      "This development had immediate and stressful consequences. The solicitor asked Barbara to begin the process of selling the home she had shared with John, in order to release his share of their assets.",
      "John's brother, Desmond, took the lead in trying to find out where John now was. It took him several weeks.",
      "He says he rang 50 care homes, trying to track John down. He and Barbara also wrote to Amy asking her to at least tell them how her grandfather was, but they say they never received a reply.",
      "Eventually, Amy's aunt confronted her in person, and found out that John was in a hotel in Torquay.",
      "Desmond knew that in the past, John had lent \u00a3100,000 to a friend who owned several hotels in south-west England.",
      "It appeared that John had been put up at one of these hotels. The owner had made a deal to offset John's bill (a nightly rate of \u00a3265) against his outstanding debt.",
      "Amy's father, David, drove to the hotel. He was horrified by what he found: \"The conditions he was living in were appalling. I was absolutely astounded.\"",
      "John was renting the room only - with no cleaning services or food. There was a fridge and a microwave oven - in which he would heat ready meals supplied by Amy.",
      "For David, it was the ultimate betrayal of a vulnerable man. He says that John was dishevelled and confused: \"He was just abandoned. He hardly went out of that room and it was in a terrible state.\"",
      "Having found John, his family decided they needed to tread carefully. They say they wanted him to understand the truth about what had been done to him, and they were also worried that Amy might try to move him again.",
      "At first, John refused to see Barbara, claiming she had tried to kill him, and that she had never come to see him in hospital.",
      "And then one day, Barbara drove to John's hotel with her son David and his partner Julie. She stayed outside in the car but gave David a tin of flapjacks to take to John in his room.",
      "The touch and smell of a faded everyday item - an old cake tin with some homemade flapjacks inside - seemed to have an effect on him.",

      "John replied: \"Yes I do.\"",
      "David then offered to bring Barbara into the hotel room and John agreed.",
      "Barbara says she was heartbroken by her husband's physical and mental deterioration. He weighed only seven-and-a-half stone, and he was so weak that she thinks he would have died if he had been left much longer.",
      "It was a \"very, very emotional\" reunion, she remembers. Before long, they were holding hands and John had agreed to come home with her.",
      "The next day, Barbara and her brother Mike came back to the hotel to pick John up. Mike says it felt like they were \"planning a heist\". He recalls that \"as we drove away and started to get out of Torquay, I said: 'Oh gosh, we got away with that.'\"",
      "Back in Wales, Barbara was able to see John's bank accounts, and discovered that Amy had taken more than \u00a35,000 - there was just 16p left in his account.",
      "But John's story had a happy ending of sorts. He managed to get the power of attorney and the new will cast aside, and lived for nine months with Barbara in Wales, before dying peacefully at home.",
      "His tale highlights the difficulties involved when it comes to deciding who has control of what's often seen as \"family money\", and who will inherit it.",
      "Issues of mental capacity have to be considered in situations like these, according to James Warner, a consultant in old-age psychiatry.",
      "\"Dementia makes people susceptible to manipulation and those involved with overseeing important changes need to be extra-vigilant,\" he says.",
      "The elderly and vulnerable can quickly find themselves in situations where they are extremely vulnerable, he says, and more needs to be done to protect them.",
      "The Office of the Public Guardian (OPG) holds power of attorney records for more than eight million people in England and Wales, but last year it investigated fewer than 1% of the cases brought to its attention.",
      "Labour MP Fabian Hamilton says the OPG can be \"toothless\" for vulnerable elderly people and their families.",
      "Mr Hamilton says changes are needed to provide greater safeguards, and his private member's bill on attorney powers is due for its second reading in June.",
      "The bill - which has cross-party support - would compel banks and regulators to check for issues such as cognitive decline, and greater scrutiny over whether an attorney is abusing their LPA powers.",
      "Barbara thinks that the proposed legislation could have helped in her situation.",
      "\"In cases like John's, where you have this kind of paranoia, solicitors involved with a power of attorney should be making enquiries of the family and verifying,\" she says.",
      "Meanwhile, John's family have had no contact with Amy, unable to forgive the hurt she caused them and what she put her grandfather through.",
      "They say they still do not understand why Amy acted in the way she did. She (along with John's other grandchildren) had already been given money enough to buy a house each, and she stood to inherit more eventually.",
      "In May 2024, Amy accepted a police caution for fraud - which in law is an admission of guilt - specifically because she had taken money from John's account after he had returned to Wales, and was no longer in her care.",
      "When I wrote to Amy about this, she replied that she had only accepted the caution to lift the stress from herself and her family, and didn't regard it as just.",
      "She told me that there were two sides to every story and that all of John's decisions were made by him in the company of his solicitor. She added that the decision not to tell John's family anything was at his request."

      "Clearer advice is needed on how to make campuses inclusive without falling foul of free speech regulations, the National Union of Students (NUS) has said.",
      "The body representing university students has expressed concern after the University of Sussex was fined \u00a3585,000 by the Office for Students (OfS) this week for failing to uphold free speech - the first case of its kind.",
      "The higher education regulator launched an investigation back in 2021 when Professor Kathleen Stock left the university. She had faced protests after saying that biological sex was more important than gender identity.",
      "According to the OfS, the university's policy statement on trans and non-binary equality, including a requirement to \"positively represent trans people\", might have led to staff and students preventing themselves from voicing opposing views.",
      "That has triggered not only the threat of a court showdown, after the university vowed to challenge the OfS's findings, but also put universities across the UK on alert over further free speech-related fines - and leaving some fearing a catch-22 situation.",
      "Universities in England are asking for clarity behind the scenes on how to protect their students from abuse and harassment because the regulator hasn't spelt out what is acceptable.",
      "The regulator told the BBC it would be writing to a handful of institutions to remind them of their duty to protect free speech. Arif Ahmed, from the OfS, warned the University of Sussex fine could have been as high as \u00a33.7m and there was \"potential for higher fines in the future\".",
      "Finding the balance",
      "Commenting for the first time since the fine was issued to Sussex, the NUS said it was concerned about the size of the fine at a time when university finances are under pressure.",
      "Its vice president for liberation and equality Saranya Thambirajah said it was important universities were welcoming places for all marginalised groups of students - and suggested the money could have gone towards improving student welfare instead.",
      "She told the BBC it's \"really unclear\" where the OfS is drawing the line on what is or isn't acceptable.",
      "\"We would say at the NUS, that the line between freedom of harm and freedom of speech right now is not falling in the right place, or at the very least, there is very little clarity from the regulator as to where that line should be falling,\" she said.",
      "The OfS has said it should be possible to express any lawful view on campus - but the trans and non-binary equality policy at the heart of the Sussex row, which was in place until last year, illustrates the potential challenges ahead.",
      "One of the concerns raised by the regulator was a section in the policy which said that harassment or bullying including intrusive behaviour, name calling or derogatory jokes were serious disciplinary offences.",
      "Now, the university has replaced it with a new trans and non-binary policy - but the regulator hasn't told bosses yet whether or not that passes the free-speech test.",
      "Next free speech fine may cost millions, unis told",
      "Government to implement university free speech law",
      "And in another potential point of tension, from 1 August a new regulation comes into force requiring universities in England to go further in showing how they will promote and uphold free speech on campus.",
      "The OfS says this shouldn't include the content of courses or discussions in the lecture hall. All higher education institutions have to meet conditions to register with the OfS in order to charge tuition fees.",
      "But they will also have to show how they are acting to prevent the harassment of students - and universities are required to try to increase applications from underrepresented groups, through initiatives to make them feel more included.",
      "Lawyer Smita Jamdar, who advises universities in England on how to comply with regulations, says that to reduce harassment, universities need to be \"really clear about the behaviour you will and will not tolerate\" and that action will be taken when students \"transgress those boundaries\".",
      "While that has to be balanced against freedom of speech, Ms Jamdar said most people would expect \"the line to be drawn somewhere other than name calling and derogatory jokes\".",
      "When the BBC looked at similar trans equality policies at a number of universities it wasn't entirely clear whether they would be considered a challenge to free speech.",
      "Of course, the implications of the Sussex fine for universities across the country straddle many other free speech debates and groups of students, including all the potential flashpoints of race, religion, ethnicity and conflict which sometimes play out on university campuses.",
      "The impacts of the Sussex fine are unlikely to go away any time soon, with vice-chancellors and students alike calling for more clarity.",
      "One of those major tests would be if University of Sussex's vice-chancellor, Prof Sasha Roseneil, gets her day in court. The university has confirmed it will seek a review by a senior judge of the inquiry.",
      "If the Sussex case gets debated in court, plenty of people on other campuses would be listening closely."

      "This is the second year figures on special school capacity have been collected by the Dfe.",
      "It says the reason for the gap in provision is because of the number of schools at or over capacity. However, the figures may not reflect the current pupils attending special schools because of the different and changing needs for which schools cater.",
      "It found there were 92,000 secondary places across special state schools in England, but about 100,000 secondary pupils on the roll in May 2024.",
      "In a highly critical report earlier this year, the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) found a Send system \"in disarray\", \"mired in red tape, lacking funding, and failing to produce value for money\".",

    "story": [
      "It is being dubbed \"awful April\" with a range of household bills set to go up in the next few days.",
      "There is nothing much you can do if your council tax is increasing, or you are buying a house and facing a higher stamp duty bill.",
      "But when it comes to other bills, such as energy, water or broadband, here are three strategies that could help ease the pressure.",
      "The seven bills going up in April",
      "The seven bills going up in April",
      "1. Shop around",
      "For some services you can often get a better deal simply by calling the company you are with and saying you are considering leaving.",
      "\"Shop around for better deals, and haggle with your existing provider,\" says Alice Haine, from professional services group Evelyn Partners.",
      "\"It's always worth haggling. Haggle for everything.\"",
      "That applies to a whole range of bills, including insurance, energy, and broadband.",
      "\"Our research shows that switching providers if you're out of contract can slash broadband, pay TV and mobile bills by up to \u00a3235,\" says Emily Seymour, from consumer group Which?",
      "Gas and electricity are often the biggest bills people face and the price cap set by the regulator is rising by 6%, so it is worth finding the best deal for you.",
      "That may include choosing a fixed rate deal, says Ms Seymour. If you charge an electric vehicle or use appliances overnight, look for a deal with a cheaper night tariff.",
      "\"We'd also recommend taking a meter reading as close to 31 March as possible to ensure you're billed the correct amount for your energy usage,\" she says.",
      "2. Cut back",
      "One surefire way to keep your bills down is to reduce what you use.",
      "Taking shorter showers and putting in a showerhead with a slower flow will save money on your water and energy bills.",
      "\"You have to treat water as an expensive resource,\" Ms Haine says.",
      "Getting a water meter fitted may save you money, she adds.",
      "Smart meters for electricity and gas can also help you keep tabs on what is pushing up your energy bills most, the Energy Saving Trust says.",
      "The trust advises draught-proofing your home, including round floorboards, pipework and old extractor fans, and setting the thermostat to the lowest comfortable temperature. For most people, it says, that is between 18\u00b0C and 21\u00b0C.",
      "MoneySavingExpert says you can save money by using the principle: \"heat the human, not the home\". Using hot water bottles and electric blankets should work out cheaper than turning up the radiators.",
      "You can also change the settings on combi or conventional boilers to save money, says Martin Lewis at MoneySavingExpert.",
      "When it comes to transport bills, you can't avoid the vehicle tax rise unless you ditch the car altogether.",
      "But if you are taking the train it is also worth checking whether a railcard will help, points out Ms Seymour.",
      "\"To cut costs on rail fares, we'd recommend booking tickets in advance and splitting fares where possible,\" she says.",
      "3. Get help",
      "If you are struggling to pay your household bills, don't panic, says Richard Lane, chief client officer at the StepChange Debt Charity. He suggests creating a detailed budget that captures all your income and expenditure.",
      "\"This will allow you to get a clear picture of your finances and see how much you have leftover to pay toward any debts or make savings,\" he says.",
      "Then check what support you are entitled to.",
      "Water companies offer lower \"social\" and hardship tariffs for people on very low incomes, so it is worth calling your provider. People claiming benefits can often also get lower tariffs for broadband.",
      "\"These organisations have a regulatory responsibility to treat customers fairly and will be able to offer you tailored support,\" Mr Lane added.",
      "There is the government's Warm Home Discount, for people with high energy costs on a very low income, including Pension Credit. And people on low incomes are also eligible for a reduction in council tax.",
      "Check if you qualify for a free TV licence. If you are over 75 and on Pension Credit or live with someone who is, then you will.",
      "You may also be able to boost your income. Check which benefits you are entitled to on the independent MoneyHelper website, backed by the government, or using benefits calculators run by Policy in Practice and charities Entitledto and Turn2us.",
      "If you are struggling with debt here are some other organisations that may be able to help."

      "The PM also denied a suggestion that showing the programme in schools would demonise boys who spend a lot of time online but haven't ended up like Jamie in Adolescence.",
      "\"I think it's probably wrong to think that there's just a group of boys that are drawn to this [material],\" he told BBC Radio 1's Newsbeat.",

    "story": [
      "Inside a soundstage once used by silent film stars Charlie Chaplin and Mabel Normand, Hollywood executives, actors and filmmakers sipped cocktails as they marvelled at what some say is the biggest breakthrough since the talkies: AI-generated video.",
      "But whether AI will be the future, or the end, of cinema is still up for debate.",
      "It was only two years ago that actors and writers shut down Hollywood with strikes demanding protections from AI. Now the technology is controversially creeping into TV, movies and video games. Two films honoured at the Oscars even used the technology.",
      "As a DJ played '90s hip hop, computer developers rubbed shoulders with actors and executives, in a sign of the changing power players in the industry.",
      "AI in Hollywood is \"inevitable\", says Bryn Mooser, the party's host and the co-founder of Moonvalley, which created the AI generator tool Marey by paying for footage from filmmakers with their consent. Mooser says that while AI may still be a dirty word, their product is \"clean\" because it pays for its content.",
      "\"Artists should be at the table,\" he says, adding that it's better to build the tool for filmmakers rather than get \"rolled over by big tech companies\".",
      "Artificial Intelligence has long been depicted as a villain in Hollywood. In The Terminator, AI used by the US military decides it must destroy everyone on earth.",
      "But it's AI's creators, and not the technology itself, that has received the brunt of real-life criticism. Companies use publicly available data to build their AI models - which includes copyrighted material shared online - and creators say they're being ripped off.",
      "OpenAI, Google and other tech companies are facing multiple lawsuits from writers, actors and news organisations, alleging their work was stolen to train AI without their consent. Studios like Paramount, Disney and Universal who own the copyright on movies and TV shows have been urged by writers to do the same, though none have taken legal action.",
      "\"We've all fought very hard for copyright laws, and nobody wants to see their work stolen to have somebody else profit from it,\" Mooser says.",
      "Hollywood has begun toying with the new technology. The Oscar-nominated films Emilia Perez and The Brutalist used AI to alter voices. Adrian Brody won the Academy Award for best actor, even with the help of AI to fine tune his accent when he spoke Hungarian in his starring role in The Brutalist. AI has even been used to de-age actors like Tom Hanks and Harrison Ford.",
      "The technology is seemingly everywhere. OpenAI hosted an AI film festival in Los Angeles earlier this month. Marvel directors Joe and Anthony Russo told the Wall Street Journal they plan to invest $400 million to craft AI tools for filmmakers.",
      "But the impacts on how it will alter the future of the entertainment industry remain unclear. Generative AI, for instance, allows computers to learn and solve problems in ways that can seem human \u2013 albeit much faster. And many worry about the technology replacing their jobs as AI is used to generate scripts, animation, locations, voices and human actors.",
      "If you ask OpenAI's popular chatbot, ChatGPT, which Hollywood jobs are most easily replaced by AI, background actors are top of the list as \"most vulnerable\" with \"A-List actors & directors\" considered safest because \"star power and brand recognition keep top talent irreplaceable\".",

But dozens of powerful people made the trek east to the hip Silver Lake neighbourhood from west Los Angeles, even though it was raining. In LA, that's remarkable.",
      "\"We're here to learn,\" said one executive who spent an hour in traffic getting to the party. \"We're not signing anything or buying anything, but we're interested.\"",
      "Mooser and his co-founder Naeem Talukdar speak passionately about how AI will transform Hollywood and allow filmmakers to create blockbuster style epics on much lower budgets. It could lead to many bad films - but it could also help discover the next Quentin Tarantino or Martin Scorsese, even if they don't have the backing of a big studio.",

      "The letter's signatories included A-List stars like Ben Stiller, Sir Paul McCartney, Cate Blanchett and Lilly Wachowski, who co-created The Matrix, which depicts a dystopian simulated reality where humans are enslaved by intelligent machines.",

What would happen to the actors, the staff who were working overnight and the production team who had everything staked on that project?\" he said. \"The more I thought of it, the more I thought that shouldn't be what I do.\"",
      "Any admission of a romantic relationship or a partner is still seen as scandalous to fans in South Korea's entertainment industry, where celebrities' personal lives come under intense scrutiny.",

      "Rabbett and Chamberlain separated in 2010 but remained close.",
      "Born on 31 March 1934 in Beverly Hills, California, Chamberlain grew up on what he called \"the wrong side of Wilshire Boulevard\" - far from the wealth of Hollywood's star-studded district.",
      "The younger of two boys, his father, Charles, was a salesman who struggled with alcoholism and became a prominent figure in Alcoholics Anonymous, travelling the world to speak at conventions. His mother, Elsa, was a homemaker.",
      "He initially studied painting at Pomona College, but a student theatre performance inspired him to pursue acting.",
      "Interest from a Hollywood scout was put on hold as he was drafted into the US Army, where he rose to the rank of sergeant while stationed in South Korea.",
      "Upon returning to California, Chamberlain took acting classes, landing several small TV roles before his breakout role as Dr Kildare.",
      "Years later, Chamberlain recounted the psychological abuse he endured during his childhood.",
      "He described how his father's \"lethal sneer\" and emotionally abusive behaviour made him feel as if he were being \"slashed with a machete\".",
      "Chamberlain also spoke about the relief he experienced in finally not having to hide his sexuality later in life."

      "It's been heavily delayed, but A Minecraft Movie is finally here.",
      "The wildly popular video game hits the big screen on Friday and boasts a star-studded cast including Jason Momoa, Jack Black and Jennifer Coolidge.",
      "It tells the story of four misfits who are suddenly pulled through a mysterious portal into the Overworld \u2013 the place where all players start in Minecraft.",
      "Minecraft is one of the world's best selling video games, so there\u2019s a lot of pressure to deliver for fans of the blocky world (my 11-year-old nephew is legitimately more excited for this than Christmas).",
      "\"This game has been loved by millions and millions all over the world for years now, and I think this movie is a big deal for a lot of people, because now it's generational,\" Black said.",
      "There's been a long history of game-to-film flops. But others, such as Sonic, were massive hits, so that's what Warner Bros will no doubt be hoping for.",
      "Djo know what I mean?",
      "By Mark Savage, music correspondent",
      "American actor Joe Keery is best known as reformed jock Steve Harrington, one of the main (and most loveable) characters in the sci-fi series Stranger Things.",
      "But he's also got a nifty line in throwback indie-pop, which he performs as Djo. The pseudonym was initially an attempt to avoid the accusations he was trading on his fame. He'd even perform in disguise.",
      "That changed when he had a breakout hit with End of Beginning \u2013 a synth-heavy slice of psychedelia that went viral on TikTok last year, often the soundtrack to videos about what people would do if they won the lottery.",
      "Stranger Things finale filming was 'incredibly emotional'",
      "The attention put a rocket under his music career. While his first two albums were DIY affairs, recorded in a couple of days and self-released, his latest, The Crux, was created in New York's fabled Electric Lady studios.",
      "Released on Friday, it's packed full of off-kilter lyrics and squiggly synth lines that burrow into your brain. The first two singles, Delete Ya and Basic Being Basic have already been radio hits, and the rest of the album pulls on influences as diverse as Electric Light Orchestra, New Order, Cake, Hall & Oates and Bruce Springsteen (coincidentally, all bands that would work perfectly on the Stranger Things soundtrack).",
      "There are a couple of knockouts \u2013 including the crunchy garage rock of Gap Toothed Smile, and the choppy New Wave anthem Link \u2013 but the point of the album is its diversity. Keery envisioned each song as the story of a separate guest at a hotel where everyone is at a spiritual or emotional crossroads.",

    "published": "Sun, 30 Mar 2025 04:40:50 GMT",
    "summary": "The opening night of the star's tour mixes flashes of brilliance with moments that fail to connect.",
    "story": [
      "Usher has kicked off a 10-night residency at London's O2 Arena with a slick, two-hour show that was impressive and frustrating in equal measure.",
      "The US pop star played more than 40 songs, including hits like Yeah, Burn, U Remind Me and OMG, with multiple costume changes and buttery-smooth choreography.",
      "But the show, which comes to the UK after a 62-date run in the US, felt oddly rough around the edges - including a handful of on-stage stumbles and missed musical cues.",
      "The momentum was frequently torpedoed by waffly, overlong video interludes - but Usher's magnetic stage presence just about held the concert together.",
      "Titled \"Past, Present, Future\", the tour is billed as an \"intimate\" look at Usher Raymond IV's 30-year career, as well as \"a glimpse into the future\".",
      "It comes as the star, one of the best-selling artists of the 2000s, is enjoying a career rebirth - following an acclaimed Super Bowl half-time show, and the release of his ninth studio album, Coming Home.",
      "With 10 sold-out shows at the O2, he enters an elite group of artists who've played double-digit residencies at the venue, alongside Queen (10 shows in 2022), Bon Jovi (12 nights in 2010) and Prince (21 nights in 2007).",
      "At its core, Past, Present, Future illustrates the skill with which the 46-year-old has navigated the evolving trends of the music industry.",
      "We see a video clip of him, aged 14, dancing to his debut single, Call Me A Mack, then watch as he transforms into a teenage heartthrob, a confessional balladeer, an EDM party-starter, and an elder statesman of R&B.",
      "He arrives from under the stage in a fog of dry ice and a cone of laser beams, apparently controlling the lights with his bare hands, before dancing to the middle of the arena with the molten fluidity of his idol, Michael Jackson.",
      "Clad in a sparkly raincoat and wide-brimmed Pharrell hat, he races through hits like Coming Home, Hey Daddy and U Make Me Wanna, backed by a funky 10-piece band and a dance team that echoes his every move.",
      "The choreography is a constant highlight. Usher's moves are so effortless that they look unrehearsed, but such ease comes at a cost: Last year, he had to postpone the start of the tour after injuring his neck in practice.",
      "At the O2, that pain seemed a distant memory, as he careened around the U-shaped stage on roller skates, pulling off a flawless moonwalk, and even freeze-framing in a handstand.",
      "He might have fumbled a hat at one point, but it was one of his dancers who came closest to calamity - losing his balance during an elaborate chair routine, sending the chair spinning across the stage.",
      "The band also suffered a mishap, missing Usher's cue to extend the intro to Superstar, and coming in four bars early. Not disastrous, but still unusual for a show on this level.",
      "The hits were punctuated by numerous interludes, narrated by Celeste, a glitch-prone \"computer driven by AI technology to help Mr Raymond tell his story\",  from teen wannabe to global superstar, against a backdrop of infidelity, tabloid infamy, redemption and survival.",
      "The problem was his songs couldn't support the weight of that story. With a few exceptions, Usher mostly sings about lusting after women in the club, and carnal pleasures in the bedroom.",
      "The result was a weirdly disconnected show, where Usher followed a moving video about his absent father with a song about his ex, which he sung while straddling a motorbike.",
      "Priapism was a running theme. Women in the audience were fed with cocktail cherries (\"oh, it's your first time?\" Usher mugged into the camera)  and part of the stage was turned into a strip club, complete with pole dancers, during Bad Girl.",
      "That sort of tongue-in-cheek raunch has been a hallmark of Usher's career, but it felt dated and shallow in a concert that promised an intimate look into his personality.",
      "Perhaps he just wanted us to know that, deep down, he really, really likes sex.",
      "Luckily, the songs still hold up. A trio of quiet storm ballads - Climax, Burn and Confessions Part II - had couples serenading each other, while a trio of women near me took the opportunity to slow dance a security guard who was mopping the floor.",
      "To his credit, Usher sang everything live, with an airy falsetto that's undiminished after 30 years on tour. During U Got It Bad, he held one sustained note for over 10 seconds.",
      "At times, he struggled to hold the audience's attention during the slow jams. The UK has always preferred him in club mode - and it was his three biggest-sellers, Yeah, OMG and DJ Got Us Falling In Love that really set the O2 alight.",
      "Strangely it was one of those empty club anthems, I Am The Party, that ultimately carried the most meaning.",
      "\"Hopefully my [music] has been something to you,\" Usher said over the introduction.",
      "\"Maybe we fell in love together, maybe we had a good time together, but something brought you here. And I just want you to know, I appreciate the connection.\"",
      "\"If I didn't have you to cheer me on, I wouldn't continue to do this.\"",
      "Pop stars say this sort of thing all the time. But as he stood at the O2, drenched in sweat, remembering the father who abandoned him and soaking up the audience's affection, Usher didn't seem to be putting on an act.",
      "By the encore, he'd given up all pretence of being a high-rolling playboy.",
      "Instead, he bounded around the stage, giddily filming the audience on his phone, as they hollered out the chorus to Without You.",
      "If only that performer had shown up earlier."

    "story": [
      "Whether you like the new Snow White film or you hate it, it's hard to escape the debate around its lead actress, Rachel Zegler.",
      "The 23-year-old star has dominated conversation about the film, as people either blame her for its poor reviews or leap to her defence, saying she's being unfairly maligned.",
      "And this debate is not new for Zegler.",
      "Way before Snow White came out, she has been at the centre of the storm, with many criticising her take on the original film and her political views, including those on US President Donald Trump and his voters.",
      "Others defended her, and expressed discomfort at seeing such a young actress suffer a pile-on.",
      "Film critic Kelechi Ehenulo calls Zegler a victim of \"culture wars\", and warns actors from underrepresented backgrounds (Zegler is Latina) often find themselves becoming \"targets for backlash\".",
      "So how did we get to this point \u2013 and where does Zegler go from here?",
      "A blame game",
      "Let's start with the film itself.",
      "Disney's live-action version of the classic fairy tale Snow White was released earlier this month, and has faced a slew of underwhelming reviews (the Observer's Wendy Ide described it as \"toe-curlingly terrible\".) US reviewers have been somewhat more positive \u2013 but despite it topping the North America box office chart, it hasn't made as much money as expected.",
      "On social media, some people have been quick to point their finger at Zegler, arguing she hampered the release.",
      "They include Jonah Platt, the son of Snow White producer Marc Platt. Earlier this week, he took aim at Zegler in a fiery social media post. It has since been deleted, but was screenshotted by multiple outlets including the New York Post.",
      "He said Zegler had \"[dragged] her personal politics\" into the film's promotional campaign, adding: \"Her actions clearly hurt the film's box office.\"",
      "Platt didn't respond to a request for comment from BBC News.",
      "The controversies started much earlier.",
      "Before the film was released, Zegler faced abuse online by people who disagreed with her casting in the role of a character deemed to have skin \"as white as snow\".",
      "Zegler made headlines after her comments, in 2022, about the original film. \"There's a big focus [in the original] on her love story with a guy who literally stalks her. Weird! So we didn't do that this time.\"",
      "Zegler also said the original film was \"extremely dated when it comes to the ideas of women being in roles of power\", adding: \"People are making these jokes about ours being the PC Snow White, where it's like, yeah, it is - because it needed that.\"",
      "Disney holds small-scale Snow White premiere amid controversy",
      "Disney holds small-scale Snow White premiere amid controversy",
      "Many saw those words as a rebuke against Disney's tradition.",
      "The Daily Mail branded it a \"woke tirade\" and an article this week in Variety said she \"trashed the beloved original Snow White\".",
      "City AM's film editor Victoria Luxford says criticism of the original film \"was never going to work out well. These films are marketed on nostalgia, on making you feel like you did when you saw the original, so to speak of it negatively seemed puzzling\".",
      "Zegler declined to comment on this piece.",
      "But Anna Smith, film critic and host of the Girls On Film podcast, told BBC News that some of the headlines may have be misleading.",
      "\"Zegler pointed out that times and attitudes have changed, and that the new Snow White has been adapted for the current age. This is the case with many remakes and reboots, many of which do not make the headlines with comments about 'woke' culture.\"",
      "Zegler's political views have also sparked a backlash.",
      "Last summer, she thanked fans for their response to the film's trailer in a post on X, adding, \"and always remember, free Palestine\".",
      "According to the Variety article, Marc Platt - mentioned above - flew to New York to speak directly with Zegler after the post.",
      "Neither Zegler nor Platt have responded to a request for a comment on that.",
      "Zegler also stoked controversy with her views after the 2024 US presidential election. Writing on Instagram, she said she hoped \"Trump voters and Trump himself never know peace\".",
      "She later apologised for what she had said.",
      "Some commend her for speaking her mind. Ehenulo says that she is \"not the first and certainly not the last actor to be speaking about politics\".",
      "And Luxford told me she was \"hard-pressed\" to imagine the film's core audience, children under 10, being swayed by her politics.",
      "But film critic Conor Riley said that her comments about Trump didn't \"help the stability of the movie's release\".",
      "He notes that Gal Gadot, who plays Snow White's stepmother, the Evil Queen, has also faced a backlash from some people. Gadot, who is Israeli, has been vocal in her support of the country.",
      "The timing of the film also didn't help, he added.",
      "\"Ultimately, [Zegler] became a lightning rod for controversy, not just due to her own actions, but because Snow White landed at the intersection of Hollywood's creative stagnation, racial politics, international conflict, and America's deep ideological divide,\" he said.",
      "'Targets for backlash'",
      "Some, like Luxford, argue that some of the pile-on comes from \"a place of prejudice\".",
      "\"She's a young Latina woman with political opinions that don't align with certain groups, who are quick to voice their anger,\" she said.",
      "Zegler is far from the first young female actress to find herself facing a toxic backlash. Recently, Stranger Things actor Millie Bobby Brown criticised press articles about her appearance, saying \"this isn't journalism, this is bullying\".",
      "Smith notes that women in positions of prominence are more likely to be targeted in this way.",
      "\"When women in the public eye are criticised, there is often bias at work. Regardless of the topic, the way it's dealt with, talked about and reported will often differ compared to the way men are treated,\" she said.",
      "Ehenulo, for her part, calls on the industry to do more to protect their stars.",
      "\"What irks me is how easy [people of colour] actors become targets for backlash on social media and yet the culture of silence from studios, news outlets and social media platforms says it all,\" she said.",
      "\"That lack of public protection... means the toxicity continues to fester and rise. It's the Wild West out there and I can't see it getting better when this has been normalised to such an extent.\"",
      "We put those claims to Disney, but they declined to comment.",
      "The big roles keep coming for Zegler. She is now signed up to star in Evita in the West End this summer, and on Friday, she made a splash in a different way - reading a CBeebies Bedtime Story.",
      "At the end of the story, Zegler tells young viewers: \"To be a powerful princess you just need to be wonderful, brilliant you!\" For some, this is a message that encapsulates Zegler herself.",
      "\"I don't know if she's going to be doing another Disney film anytime soon,\" says Luxford, \"but she's 23, she's a Golden Globe winner, and she's a very talented actor.\"",

    "story": [
      "\"It's just weird to talk about your sexual feelings to your parents,\" says 15-year-old Ben*.",
      "His parents, Sophie and Martin, two professionals in their 40s, nod understandingly. They are discussing the kinds of \"big issues\" Ben's social media usage throws up, and for Ben their conversations about sex and pornography are \"the worst\".",
      "The family \u2013 minus Ben's little sister, who is too young to join the discussion \u2013 are gathered in their living room to dissect the smash-hit Netflix drama Adolescence, which they watched the previous evening.",
      "The series follows the story of 13-year-old protagonist Jamie, who is accused of murdering a female peer after being exposed to misogynistic online material and subjected to cyberbullying.",
      "Both of Ben's parents are concerned their own son's behaviour is being impacted by the material he is exposed to, and Ben, who is worried himself, is trying to set limits on his own phone use.",
      "Given their concerns, and how they overlap with the themes of Adolescence, the family agreed to watch the programme together and allowed BBC News to sit in on their discussion, which ranged from the relevance of Andrew Tate to whether boys and girls can be friends.",
      "'People just call each other virgins'",
      "Ben is sitting on the sofa in the living room scrolling on his phone before the conversation begins.",
      "The parents take their seats looking relaxed despite the difficult subjects they are about to discuss. Photos of loved ones line the bookshelves in the family's living room, and a piano stands against the wall.",
      "Sophie and Martin have worked hard to create a \"very open\" household, Sophie says, where \"all topics are on the table\". While watching the programme, Sophie made a list of things to talk about with Ben.",
      "A confident and outspoken teenage boy, Ben is well-liked by fellow pupils at his single-sex state secondary school. But the qualities that make him popular with his peers often land him in trouble with his teachers, who give him detentions or send him to isolation for making what his mother describes as \"inappropriate comments\".",
      "In the show, Jamie and his peers use language associated with the \"manosphere\" \u2013 websites and online forums promoting misogyny and opposition to feminism \u2013 and incel culture. Incels, short for involuntary celibate, are men who blame women because they are unable to find a sexual partner. It is an ideology that has been linked to terror attacks and killings in recent years.",
      "Perhaps surprisingly, \"incel\" wasn't a familiar term to Ben, and his dad Martin had to explain it as they watched the programme.",
      "\"People just call each other 'virgins'. I've not heard 'incel' before,\" Ben tells his parents. He suggests the term might have \"dropped off\" social media for young people in recent years, reflecting the pace at which the conversation moves online.",
      "Ben tells his parents there are elements of the show he recognises, including its depiction of the fights and cyberbullying at school. But he thinks it is only a \"rough picture\" of what it's like to be a teenager today, and that it was principally made for \"an adult who isn't online\".",
      "For example, it neglects to show the good side of social media alongside its dangers, he says, and some details \u2013 including the secret emoji codes one character claims children use \u2013 ring false.",
      "It is for this reason that Martin, who says he enjoyed the tense drama, also feels the show is playing on every parent's \"worst nightmare\" about their child's phone use, meaning it sometimes favours theatrics over realism in an attempt to \"shock\" adults into action.",
      "Andrew Tate, an influencer and central figure of the shadowy online world of the manosphere, is mentioned by name in the drama and has been the cause of much concern among parents and teachers. But Ben says that while Andrew Tate was \"popular\" at his school about two years ago, he is now \"old news\".",
      "Ben has noticed the way Tate combines health and wellbeing with politics. \"Some of his things, like 'exercise for an hour a day' \u2013 fair enough, that's correct. But then he combines it with far-right ideas, like 'the man should go out and work and the wife should stay at home',\" Ben says.",
      "Both parents agree that Tate is not to blame for misogyny. As far as they're concerned, he is symptomatic of \"a bigger social problem\".",
      "Can boys and girls be friends?",
      "This problem is represented starkly in the bleak picture Adolescence paints of male-female friendships in the social media age. Protagonist Jamie doesn't have any female friends, and appears to view relations with the opposite sex through a lens of dominance and manipulation.",
      "Sophie is concerned that interactions between boys and girls are distant and impersonal in Ben's peer group. She says Ben doesn't have many opportunities to mix with girls his age.",
      "And she worries her son is getting most of his information about how to interact with girls from social media. \"It's really twisted,\" she says. \"They don't know how to behave around each other.\"",
      "She asks her son a question: \"If you don't know how to talk to girls when you're feeling awkward, if you're like, 'Eurgh, I don't know how to dress', where do you go for help?\"",
      "\"Online,\" Ben says.",
      "\"So it goes full circle,\" says his mum. \"That's where they get information.\"",

      "\"I don't remember him getting annoyed with me like that, but okay,\" Ben says.",
      "They debate their varying recollections of events until they land on a version on which they can agree: \"His cousin was like, 'No, that's my friend. I don't think of them in that way,'\" Sophie says.",
      "\"That was really eye-opening for him,\" she says. Turning to Ben, she recalls: \"You came back from it, and you were like, 'It's much better [at my cousin's], girls and boys are friends.'\"",
      "Sharing intimate images",
      "In the Netflix drama, it is revealed that Jamie's victim Katie had been subjected to misogynistic bullying after a male classmate shared intimate images of her without her consent.",
      "Jamie's discussion of this incident with a child psychologist, played by Erin Doherty, is pivotal to the programme's acclaimed third episode.",
      "Ben has seen this kind of abuse of trust among his peers too. \"There's a guy near here, and [a picture of] his genitals got leaked on a massive group chat with loads of people,\" he says. \"That was a big thing on TikTok.\"",
      "The series kicks off with an episode in which police question Jamie about the sexualised images of adult women he has shared on his Instagram page, hinting at the ease with which young teenagers can access pornography.",
      "This feels familiar to Ben, who thinks porn is the \"biggest issue\" among his peer group. He knows boys who are \"addicted\" to it: \"They rely on it. There are people in my year who'll have such a bad day unless they watch it.\"",
      "Ben squirms a little while talking about pornography, staring at the wall or fiddling with his phone.",
      "He seems more comfortable talking about the other forms of concerning content young people come across online.",
      "He estimates that \"one in 10\" videos he watches on his phone contain distressing material, including scenes of extreme violence. And Ben's parents are under no illusions that their son is \"safe\" just because he is upstairs on his computer - unlike Jamie's parents in the show.",
      "What can be done?",
      "For Martin and Sophie, the solution lies in giving children better opportunities to \"participate\" in society and build their self-esteem.",
      "They say they are also keen for their son to have \"wide range\" of male role models to learn from. Ben, who has paused to check his phone several times in the course of their discussion, re-engages with the conversation.",
      "He is animated in his praise for his sports coaches, whose \"really strong morals\" he admires.",
      "The parents nod, evidently pleased by his enthusiasm. They say they pack their son's life with activities in an attempt to get him off his phone. But this is expensive, they say, and puts poorer students at a disadvantage.",
      "Sophie says of the show's main character, Jamie: \"He doesn't have sport. He doesn't feel good about himself. His dad looks away when he fails.\"",
      "Adolescence shows that children with limited opportunities to build their self-esteem are more \"vulnerable\" to the predatory messages of misogynistic influencers, Sophie says.",
      "Both parents agree tech companies, the government, schools and families all have a responsibility to offer young people a convincing alternative to the siren call of the manosphere.",
      "They insist parents can't do it alone. As Sophie says: \"It's a tsunami and someone's given me an umbrella.\"",
      "Ben thinks what happens online is too often dismissed by adults as being irrelevant to the real world. He thinks this is a mistake; social media should be treated \"like real life \u2013 because it is real life\", he says.",

      "Paramount Studios was interested in him, but thoughts of an acting career were put on hold after he was called up, serving 16 months with the US Army, rising to the rank of sergeant while stationed in Korea.",
      "On his discharge, he made a number of cameos in TV shows, including an episode of the popular Western, Gunsmoke.",
      "Not everyone had Chamberlain picked as a future star.",
      "He was handsome enough: with profiles at the time gushing over his \"fine-lined aristocratic face, suggesting a young Florentine noble - straight out of the Renaissance\".",
      "But, he was naturally diffident - which worked in his favour when he auditioned to play Dr James Kildare, a medical intern struggling to learn his profession, in NBC's new primetime medical drama.",
      "\"Perhaps it was inevitable,\" said one friend-and-rival. \"Who else could look so anti-sceptic as Dick?\"",
      "The series ran for nearly 200 programmes across five seasons.",
      "It broke new ground, by raising matters such as drug addiction - which had not previously been shown on US TV.",
      "There was a huge reaction from female fans.",
      "Chamberlain got 12,000 letters a week. In Pittsburgh, 450,000 people turned out to see him at a parade, and in New York, he nearly caused a riot when a child spotted him and called his name.",
      "The studio made the most of this attention, releasing novels, comics and games featuring Chamberlain's image.",
      "Fans would even write in asking \"Dr Kildare\" to solve their various medical problems.",
      "And Chamberlain had an unlikely hit single: Three Stars Will Shine Tonight, where romantic words were added to the show's distinctive opening theme tune.",
      "He won a Golden Globe Award for best TV actor in 1963. But, three years later audiences began to wane, and NBC pulled the plug.",
      "Now an international star, Chamberlain struggled to leave Kildare behind.",
      "In 1966, he hoped to break into films, but reviews slated his performance in the light romantic comedy, Joy in the Morning.",
      "Audiences, they said, laughed in \"all the wrong places\". So, he resolved to ignore Hollywood and make a living on the stage.",
      "He got off to a rocky start when a musical version of Breakfast at Tiffany's - in which he starred opposite Mary Tyler Moore - closed after just four shows.",
      "The production is still seen as one of Broadway's biggest ever turkeys. But a move to England gave him a chance of reinventing himself as a 'serious actor.'",
      "In 1967, there were starring roles in Henry James' Portrait of a Lady and opposite Katherine Hepburn in a satirical comedy called The Madwoman of Chaillot.",
      "And, two years later, he became the first American to play Hamlet at the Birmingham Repertory Theatre since the great John Barrymore in 1925.",
      "This time, the reviews were excellent and he revisited the role of Denmark's most tortured prince for a television version for Hallmark.",
      "But Chamberlain was cast as Tchaikovsky in Ken Russell's overblown biopic, The Music Lovers, in which he starred opposite Glenda Jackson.",
      "The critics rubbished the film, in which great play was made of the relationship between a composer with repressed homosexual tendencies and his nymphomaniac wife, although it later became something of a cult success.",
      "Chamberlain went on to play Lord Byron opposite Sarah Miles in Lady Caroline Lamb and the swashbuckling French swordsman Aramis in Richard Lester's The Three Musketeers.",
      "He also appeared - along with half of Hollywood - in the Towering Inferno, as a crooked electrical engineer whose corner-cutting leads to the spectacular destruction of a 138 floor building.",
      "In 1977, the TV series Roots - set in the era of American slavery - drew huge audiences and was nominated for nearly 40 Emmy awards.",
      "It sparked a revival of the mini-series which drew Chamberlain back to television.",
      "He beat Roger Moore and Albert Finney to be cast as John Blackthorn - a captive English navigator in 17th Century Japan - in Shogun.",
      "The series was shown on NBC over five nights in 1980, with audiences reaching nearly 30 million.",
      "Having won a Golden Globe, Chamberlain then picked up another as Father Ralph de Bricassart in The Thorn Birds, a priest torn between God and his sexual longing for the actress, Rachel Ward.",
      "It was even more successful than Shogun, winning an audience of 60% of television viewers and 16 Emmy nominations.",
      "In the 1990s, Chamberlain's career began to wane.",
      "There were a succession of solid, rather than outstanding, performances in made-for-TV films and endless guest appearances in other people's shows.",
      "These included a sequel to The Thorn Birds called The Missing Years, with Amanda Donohoe replacing Rachel Ward.",
      "In 2003, long after he had stopped playing romantic leading men, Chamberlain published his biography Shattered Love, in which, for the first time, he confirmed he was gay.",
      "Despite a relationship of more than 30 years with the actor and director Martin Rabbett, with whom he'd once starred in the film Allan Quatermain and the Lost City of Gold, they had kept their private life private.",
      "\"I thought there was something very, very deeply wrong with me,\" he said, \"and I wanted to cover it up. I remember making a pact with myself that I would never, ever reveal this secret, ever.\"",
      "Chamberlain and Rabbett went their separate ways in 2010.",
      "In later years, Chamberlain was happy to play a gay man, notably in Desperate Housewives and Will & Grace.",
      "He continued to perform in musical theatre, including touring productions of Spamalot, My Fair Lady and The Sound of Music.",
      "But he never regretted hiding his sexuality to protect his career.",
      "\"I would have been a happier person being out of the closet and being free,\" he told El Pais in 2024. \"But I had other motives that made me happy. I was a working actor and for me, that was most important.\"",
      "He will be remembered as the king of the TV mini-series: the dashing leading man in everything from Dr Kildare to The Thorn Birds.",
      "Despite attempts to reinvent himself as a serious stage actor, he was at his best on the small screen, entertaining millions watching at home on the sofa.",
      "For, although there were always better actors than Richard Chamberlain, few rivalled his ability to hold a television audience."

    "story": [
      "Alex Warren is on top of the world.",
      "Ordinary, a song he wrote for his wife Kouvr after their wedding last year, is at number one in six different countries.",
      "He has two more songs in the UK Top 40, and his UK tour has been upgraded to 5,000-capacity venues, due to insatiable demand.",
      "Backstage at the Hammersmith Apollo, the Californian singer is endearingly, humbly bewildered by the whole thing.",
      "\"All of this is happening really quickly,\" he says. \"I only wrote Ordinary three months ago. I'm honestly blown away.\"",
      "But the 24-year-old didn't arrive out of nowhere.",
      "He's one of the founders of the Hype House \u2013 a collaborative TikTok group who lived and worked together in the Los Angeles hills and shepherded millions of teenagers though the pandemic.",
      "You could easily dismiss him as yet another social media influencer trying to break into the music industry. It's an accusation he's aware of, and prepared for.",
      "\"I watched a lot of people, a lot of TikTokkers, make music and there was no meaning behind it. It was just something they decided to do,\" he says.",
      "\"But I wanted to write about real things. No one else can sing my songs. I don't take other people's demos. This is all mine.\"",
      "Even a passing glance at his discography proves him right.",
      "Warren's arena pop anthems are searingly honest, almost to a fault, drawing on his challenging childhood, and fairytale romance with Kouvr.",
      "His father died when he was nine years old, after a long struggle with kidney cancer. The loss sent his mother spiralling into alcoholism, something Warren only realised when he tried to clear up one of her coffee mugs.",
      "\"It turned out to be alcohol,\" he says. \"And the next day it was alcohol, and the next day it was alcohol, and at 4am it was alcohol, and when we were driving, it was alcohol.\"",
      "When he called her out on it, the addiction turned to abuse.",
      "\"Every person struggling with addiction needs someone to blame it on, besides themselves, and I became that person,\" he says.",
      "When he was 18, she kicked him out. He was broke and homeless. Friends let him sleep in their cars \u2013 never their houses, because his mum had convinced their parents he was a trouble-maker.",
      "Around the same time, he was introduced to Instagram model Kouvr Annon by a friend on Snapchat.",
      "\"We just clicked right away,\" he says. \"I felt I could tell her everything, just after our first conversation.\"",
      "Within four months, Kouvr left her family in Hawaii, flew out to California and started living with Warren in a car.",
      "Then, as now, they're an exceptionally cute couple \u2013 tender and funny and clearly besotted with one another. When they started posting videos of their romance online, people wanted to see more. In a span of six months, Warren gained more than a million followers on YouTube.",
      "Combined with the prank videos he'd filmed with his friends, he built a big enough audience to start earning money.",
      "\"When I got my first cheque for $2,000 in a month, I was like, 'Holy cow, this is gonna change my life',\" he recalls.",
      "Some of that money went into the creation of the Hype House in 2019. Warren came up with the name, and moved into the property with Annon and a bunch of young internet stars like Addison Rae, Charlie D'Amelio, Chase Hudson and Thomas Petrou.",
      "The collective introduced themselves in December 2019 with a photoshoot that mimicked Backstreet Boys video for I Want It That Way.",
      "By the end of the day, the hashtag #hypehouse was trending, and the mansion quickly became an incubator for viral videos.",
      "The enterprise thrived during lockdown but, as individual members signed TV deals, or grew tired of the escalating demands for content, it started to fall apart. Warren and Annon left in 2022, citing a desire to \"move on to the next chapter in their lives\".",
      "Since then, rumours have swirled about behind-the-scenes drama at the house, with some members hinting at exploitation and mistreatment.",
      "\"There was falling out,\" Warren told the Zach Sang show in 2023. \"But a lot of us signed NDAs, so no-one's going to talk about it.\"",
      "He did, however, pour his frustrations into music.",
      "\"How do you sleep at night?\" he sings on the angst-ridden Burning Down, a song allegedly targeted at one of the Hype House's co-founders.",
      "\"It scars forever when someone you called your friend / Shows you the truth can be so cold.\"",
      "Warren says he never made money from the Hype House. What it did give him, however, was a built-in audience for his music.",
      "\"I think that's really rare,\" he says. \"Usually, when someone goes from social media to music, they lose that fan base.",
      "\"But I think a lot of people watched my YouTube videos because they were having a rough life and needed an escape. So when I started making music about my rough life, I think they identified with it even more.\"",
      "Warren dreamt of a music career long before he entered the Hype House. Back when TikTok was called Music.ally, he'd even created a burner account to share his songs.",
      "\"I didn't want to post on my main account, because I was terrified of failing,\" he explains.",
      "\"As a kid, people bullied me for singing and doing talent shows and dedicating songs to my fifth grade girlfriend, you know?",
      "\"So I posted on a random account I created, and I filmed myself singing on the toilet because I wanted to show I wasn't taking it seriously.",
      "\"And the next day, I woke up and had 10 million views.\"",
      "His first release was 2021's One More I Love You, a song he started when he was 13 years old and coming to terms with his father's death.",
      "\"I watched my sister go to a daddy-daughter dance without her dad, and that's when I realised, 'Oh, wait, my life is different',\" he recalls.",
      "\"I started mourning for the first time, and I didn't know how to process it, so I just went to the piano and played some chords. And that's kind of where I started learning how to write.\"",
      "Warren's outpouring of grief is powerful in its simplicity, but it has touched people in ways he couldn't have anticipated.",
      "\"The other day, a woman wanted me to sign a Heinz Beans t-shirt,\" he says. \"I giggled because I thought that was funny, then she turned it over, and it was the same t-shirt her son wore right before he died from cancer.",
      "\"One More I Love You was the song that she played at that funeral and the song she listened to help her get over it.\"",
      "\"I think that's the most powerful thing in the world.\"",
      "The musician, who was raised a Catholic, believes that healing moments like those are part of God's plan for him.",
      "\"Without all the loss, all the trauma, all the things in my life, I wouldn't have these songs. I wouldn't have the means to help the 5,000 people coming to the show tonight, I wouldn't be able to provide for my future family with my wife.",
      "\"And I think those are all things that are meant to happen, or can happen if I make the  right choices.",
      "\"You know, I could have chosen to get into drugs and be a bad person but I chose this path.",
      "\"It's the craziest thing.\""

    "summary": "The BBC correspondent was deported from Turkey this week after covering ongoing mass protests in the country.",
    "story": [
      "I had just sent my family a message saying how happy I was to be back in Turkey, where I used to live, and how it felt like coming home. Then, the phone in my hotel room rang.",
      "\"We have an urgent matter to discuss in person,\" the receptionist said. \"Could you come down?\"",
      "I arrived to find three plain-clothes policemen waiting for me. They asked me for my passport and led me away, trying to prevent my colleagues from filming.",
      "I had been in Istanbul for three days by then, covering the anti-government protests sparked by the arrest of the city's mayor, Ekrem Imamoglu.",
      "I was taken first to the police headquarters and held for seven hours. Two colleagues were allowed to be present and lawyers could come in to talk. The atmosphere was generally cordial. Some of the police officers told me they didn't agree with what they said was a state decision. One hugged me and said he hoped for my freedom.",
      "At 9.30pm, I was moved to the foreigners' custody unit of the Istanbul police. There, the atmosphere hardened from a succession of chain-smoking officers, with whom I had to negotiate in my broken Turkish. I was fingerprinted and denied access to lawyers or any contact with the outside world.",
      "In the early hours of Thursday, I was presented with papers to say I was being deported for being \"a threat to public order\". When I asked for an explanation, they said it was a government decision.",
      "One police officer suggested he film me saying that I was leaving Turkey of my own accord, which could help me to return in the future and which he could show his bosses. I politely refused, suspecting it would be given to the government-controlled media to push their version of events.",
      "By 2.30am, I was being moved to a final location \u2013 the foreigners' custody department at the airport. I was put in a room with a few rows of hard chairs and told I could sleep there. Between police officers entering to brush their teeth, planes taking off and the morning call to prayer, no sleep came.",
      "Seventeen hours after my initial detention, I was driven to a waiting plane to board a one-way flight to London. That night, after the case was made public, sparking significant media coverage around the world, the Turkish government press office released a statement saying I had lacked the correct accreditation. At no point had they mentioned this during my detention and it seemed clear that it was an afterthought on their part to attempt to justify my case.",
      "I was never mistreated at any point during the ordeal. And I knew throughout that BBC management and the British Consulate in Istanbul were working hard to secure my release.",
      "So many others who have fallen foul of the Turkish authorities do not have such a safety net. When I lived there as the BBC Istanbul correspondent between 2014 and 2019, Turkey was the world's biggest jailer of journalists. The watchdog Reporters Without Borders ranks Turkey 158th of 180 countries in the Press Freedom Index. Since these latest protests began, eleven journalists are among the two thousand or so people who have been detained.",
      "The latest unrest was sparked by the arrest of Ekrem Imamoglu, Recep Tayyip Erdogan's main political rival, whom opinion polls suggest could unseat the President in an election.",
      "But they have grown into something much wider: a clamour for democracy in a country sliding further into authoritarianism. The clampdown on the media is central to that trajectory, as the government has progressively crushed criticism or debate. I caught a glimpse of that first hand. It ended for me with sadness and sleeplessness. For others, it's been so much worse.",
      "Meanwhile, President Erdogan is digging in, dismissing the protests as \"street terrorism\". He's emboldened by the current international climate of having an ally in the White House and of Turkey's importance to everything from Ukraine to Syria.",
      "The question now is whether the country's biggest demonstrations in over a decade can sustain momentum or whether Turkey's long-time leader can simply brush this off. Those out on the street may be chanting \"enough\" \u2013 but they also know never to write off Recep Tayyip Erdogan.",

    "summary": "The TV couple are opening up their home and their lives in a new reality series for BBC One.",
    "story": [
      "We might feel like we know Stacey Solomon and Joe Swash already. We have seen them live off rice and beans in the Australian rainforest in I'm a Celebrity\u2026 Get Me Out of Here! We have watched Joe learn to ice skate in Dancing on Ice and Stacey declutter homes in Sort Your Life Out.",
      "But now the couple are going one step further and allowing viewers inside Pickle Cottage, their family home in Essex, in a new reality series for BBC One.",
      "It is a fly-on-the-wall series - and Stacey says she only realised in the thick of the filming that viewers can see everything, \"and then you panic a bit\", she tells the BBC.",
      "But ultimately, they are just a normal family \"doing our best in every aspect of our lives\", she says.",
      "\"So in the end, you sort of relax with that, and you think, 'Oh well, so they saw us get the hump with each other, or they saw us do something wrong'.",
      "\"That is probably the best thing we could show the world, because everything isn't perfect.\"",
      "There was no point in doing a reality show, says Joe, if they were not going to be honest.",
      "\"We don't want to glamourise anything,\" says Joe. \"Our biggest discussions at the beginning of this were, 'how much are people going to want to watch us take the kids to school and change nappies?' Our lives are not that exciting.\"",
      "Joe, 43, a former EastEnders actor, and Stacey, 35, a former X Factor contestant, met on the set of I'm a Celebrity in 2010 and have been in a relationship since 2016.",
      "They married in 2022 and are raising five children - Zach, Leighton, Rex, Rose and Belle - aged between 17 and two, alongside two dogs and four ducks.",
      "\"When I met Joe, my older children [Zach and Leighton] were four and seven,\" says Stacey, \"so they were little.\"",
      "When people say it is nice to see a blended family, she says she forgets that is what they are. \"To be honest, we're just a family.\"",
      "Joe says he struggles sometimes with the words - blended family, stepdad and stepsons.",
      "\"I love [Zach and Leighton] as much as I love all my other kids,\" he says. \"There's no distinction.\"",
      "When it comes to childcare, the couple do not have a nanny or au pair, but they do have a very supportive family.",
      "\"We've got Dave - my dad - and my sister,\" says Stacey. \"And I always say this, we live like a Kibbutz. We basically all chip in with each other.\"",
      "As well as juggling family and work, viewers will get to see all aspects of Stacey and Joe's lives, which, like any relationship, can include the odd disagreement.",
      "\"We want to show that we love each other, but sometimes we kill each other,\" says Joe. \"It's all part of it, and other couples do the same, so they'll relate to that.\"",
      "Stacey says she found being able to watch back and reflect on a situation quite helpful as she could see it from an outsider's point of view, which she believes is healthy for a relationship.",
      "Viewers will also get to see the love and support Stacey and Joe give each other. Joe describes Stacey as extremely loyal, like a \"mother lion\".",
      "\"Don't go near her cubs, she'll have you,\" he says.",
      "\"She's just the most wonderful person,\" he says. \"She's kind, she's loving. I mean there's nothing about Stacey I would change. People love her in the streets and, imagine me, I'm so lucky, I get to spend the rest of my life with her.\"",
      "Joe has the ability to give everyone a bit of himself, says Stacey, which is \"so magic\" and he has the most incredible amount of empathy, she says.",
      "Their parenting styles, on the other hand, are \"polar opposite\" she says.",
      "\"I'm aware that Stacey takes a lot of the brunt because I let [the children] do something and she's the one that has to say, 'No, you can't do that',\" says Joe. \"So she has to play bad cop quite a lot of the time, which I am aware of, but I just don't know any other way.\"",
      "Stacey believes this stems from the fact that Joe lost his father when he was very young.",
      "\"I think that when that happens to you in your life, obviously you just want to be\u2026 fun, happy. You don't want to create any negative memories,\" she says.",
      "For their family, having young children and teenagers growing up together has created something really magical.",
      "Stacey says the teenage boys can revert to being younger again which is important because they grow up so quickly in the modern world. They have the chance to still play, with the excuse being \"oh, I'm only doing it because it's with my little brother or little sister\", she says.",
      "It also gives the older boys a massive sense of responsibility, she adds.",
      "Raising five children requires military-style organisation, says Stacey, something she learnt after having her first son at the age of 17.",
      "\"I, quite frankly, was probably the most scatty teenager you've ever known,\" says Stacey. \"When I had Zachary, I had this one whole life that I was responsible for, and so many things that I had to do that I'd never had to consider.\"",
      "She says she would get a giro - a welfare cheque - to cash in at a certain time on a Thursday at the Post Office, and she realised she could not be late as she needed the money for groceries.",
      "Stacey relied on Zach and \"asked a lot of him\", she says, needing him to help her.",
      "\"I haven't done that with the younger ones, because I've had Joe,\" she says, \"and that's just the reality of my situation. It's been different through the years.\"",
      "But Zach, now 17 himself, is \"probably one of the most empathetic, caring, emotionally intelligent young teenagers that I know,\" says Stacey.",
      "\"I feel like that has a lot to do with how we grew up together, and how life was for us in the beginning.\"",
      "Having more children is not currently on Stacey's radar, she says, as her body is still recovering from having three children in five years.",
      "\"My pelvic floor is dying,\" she laughs. Although Joe would love to have more.",
      "Stacey still has plans to increase their brood - but this time it is their animals.",
      "\"I literally walked into a conversation the other day and I heard 'cow',\" says Joe, \"and I was like, 'No way, we can't have a cow'.\"",
      "\"We were just throwing a few ideas around,\" says Stacey. \"I would love to have animals and make our own milk and collect our own eggs and grow our own vegetables.",
      "\"That's a dream of mine - but in the future. At the moment, we're still rearing children.\"",
      "Stacey & Joe starts on Tuesday 1 April at 20:00 BST on BBC One and BBC iPlayer."

    "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdxq309kexeo",
    "published": "Wed, 26 Mar 2025 12:33:21 GMT",
    "summary": "NewJeans talk to the BBC in their first interview since a court blocked their attempt to leave their record label.",
    "story": [
      "\"It took a huge amount of courage to speak out,\" NewJeans have told the BBC in their first interview since a court blocked their attempt to leave their record label, in a case that has rocked the K-pop industry.",
      "\"This fight is necessary. Although it will be extremely difficult and arduous, we will keep doing what we have done so far and speak up,\" said Haerin, one of the members of the five-piece.",
      "\"We thought it was important to tell the world about what we've been through. All the choices we've made so far have been the best choices we could have made.\"",
      "NewJeans looked invincible in the charts when they launched what was an unusual rebellion in the high-pressure, tightly-controlled world of K-pop. Hanni, Hyein, Haerin, Danielle and Minji stunned South Korea and fans everywhere with their decision in November to split from Ador, the label that launched them.",
      "They alleged mistreatment, workplace harassment and an attempt to \"undermine their careers\", which Ador denies. It sued to enforce their seven-year contract, which is set to expire in 2029, and sought an injunction against any commercial activities by the group.",
      "On Friday, a South Korean court granted it, ordering NewJeans to stop all \"independent\" activities, including song releases and advertising deals, while the case was still under way. NewJeans has since challenged the injunction in court.",
      "Friday's ruling was a \"shock\", the group told the BBC.",
      "\"Some people think that we're famous enough to do whatever we want and say whatever we please. But the truth is, it's not like that at all,\" Hyein said. \"We held it in for a long time, and only now have we finally spoken up about what we think, what we feel and the unfairness we've experienced.\"",
      "The K-pop industry has repeatedly come under fire for the pressure it puts on its stars not only to perform and succeed, but to appear perfect. But rarely do conflicts spill into the public, exposing stars' grievances and rifts with their labels.",
      "NewJeans' dramatic announcement last year followed a long and public spat with Ador and its parent company, Hybe - South Korea's biggest music label, whose client list includes K-pop royalty such as BTS and Seventeen.",
      "Ador told the BBC in a statement that the contract with NewJeans still stands, adding that \"most of their claims have risen from misunderstandings\". The court said that NewJeans did not \"sufficiently prove\" that Ador had violated the contract, adding that the label had upheld \"most of its duties, including payment\".",
      "The girls were rehearsing for a performance in Hong Kong, when news of the ruling dropped. They found out when Minji got a worried message from her mother: \"She asked me, 'are you okay?' And I was like 'what happened?'\"",
      "\"I was stunned,\" Minji says. So were the others when she told them. \"At first I thought I didn't hear her properly,\" Danielle says. \"We were all kind of in shock.\"",
      "This was their second of two interviews with the BBC in as many weeks. In the first interview, which happened before the ruling, the group had been excited to release their new single, Pit Stop - their first since they announced their break from Ador and renamed themselves NJZ.",
      "They spoke about how they coped with a difficult period, including finding comfort in cooking. \"I'm not really good at it but it's kind of healing,\" Minji had said, before promising to cook an \"amazing dinner\" for the group.",
      "In the second interview, which was 24 hours after the ruling, they seemed disheartened and unsettled, less sure of what was to come. \"If we knew we were gonna go through this, maybe we would have chosen\u2026\" Hanni trailed off as she teared up.",
      "Seconds later, she continued: \"Even if we do everything we can and it doesn't work out the way we hope it does, then we'll just have to leave it to time. I'm sure time would figure it out for us.\"",
      "The following night, they took to the stage in Hong Kong and, despite the court order, performed Pit Stop under their new name. But the evening, which they had pitched to fans as a fresh start, ended in tears as they told the crowd they were going on a hiatus.",
      "\"It wasn't any easy decision to make,\" Hyein said on stage, as each of them took turns to address their fans. \"But at the moment for us, it's about protecting ourselves, so that we can come back stronger.\"",
      "Just three years into their debut, the future of the young stars - they are aged between 16 and 20 - is now in question.",
      "But they tell the BBC that this is not the end of the road for them as they \"find more ways\" forward. With the legal battle expected to last for months, if not years, Minji says that gives them time to plan what they want to do next.",
      "Ever since they debuted in July 2022, NewJeans have delivered remarkable success with each new release - OMG, Ditto, Super Shy, Attention. A year on, they were the eighth biggest-selling act in the world.",
      "Critics called them a \"game-changer\" as their uniquely playful blend of 1990s R&B and sugar-coated pop melodies broke through a K-pop market dominated by electronic beats. And their breezy dance moves stood out among super-synchronised videos.",
      "They were still on the rise when Min Hee-jin - Ador's former boss and their long-time mentor, who launched them - began trading accusations publicly with Hybe. The music label had created Ador, granting Min a minority shareholding and further stock options, before she was removed from her role last August.",
      "Hybe was now accusing her of plotting Ador's takeover and Min, in an emotional press conference, accused them of undermining NewJeans by launching another girl group with a similar style. The fight got uglier and Min left the company, alleging she was forced out.",
      "That's when NewJeans broke their silence - they demanded Min's return in two weeks in a livestream.",
      "They were not able to contact her for a while, Danielle told the BBC in the first interview: \"We didn't know what was happening and we didn't have a way to support her. That itself was a hard thing because she was always there for us and\u2026 in a way a person to look up to.\"",
      "Ador had said Min could not return as CEO, but could continue as an internal director and NewJeans' producer. When Min didn't return, NewJeans announced that they were leaving Ador and accused the label of not meeting other demands: an apology for alleged bullying and actions against what they claimed were controversial internal reports.",
      "Ador, which denies all these allegations, appears to blame Min for their dispute with NewJeans. \"The core of this issue lies in the label's ex-management providing distorted explanations to their artists, leading to misunderstandings. They can be fully addressed and resolved upon the members' return to the label,\" Ador told the BBC in a statement.",
      "In the months since, Hanni, a Vietnamese-Australian, testified in tears to South Korean lawmakers in an inquiry into workplace harassment. \"I came to the realisation that this wasn't just a feeling. I was honestly convinced that the company hated us,\" she told them, after describing several incidents where she said the group felt undermined and bullied.",
      "NewJeans' case was dismissed because the labour ministry said K-pop stars did not qualify as workers and were not entitled to the same rights.",
      "Then in December, NewJeans took another rare step by supporting fans who were calling for the impeachment of South Korea's disgraced president, Yoon Suk Yeol who had briefly imposed martial law - the group provided free food and drinks to fans who showed up at the huge protest rallies.",
      "With each round of publicity, there was also criticism, much of it involving their age. Some said they had \"crossed the line\", while others called them \"stupid and reckless,\" and even \"ungrateful\" for picking a fight with Ador. Others questioned if they were making their own decisions.",
      "Being young doesn't mean they should be taken less seriously, the group says. \"That's an easy way to devalue the fact that we are actually trying to do something,\" Hanni says. \"The decisions we've made in the past year have been decided through a very, very large amount of discussion between us.\"",
      "As the dispute has dragged on, the critics have got louder, dubbing the girls as troublemakers rather than game-changers. Following the ruling, which their critics welcomed, NewJeans say they have been \"very aware of the intense scrutiny and judgment\" ever since they held that press conference last year.",
      "\"There hasn't been a single moment when we've expressed our opinions without worry or tension,\"  Minji says. \"We've thought more than anyone else about how much responsibility each of our actions carries, and we're currently bearing that responsibility ourselves.\"",
      "It's not clear how long their hiatus will last. Ador says it hopes to meet the group soon to discuss the future, but NewJeans insist they don't feel protected enough to go back.",
      "Their lawsuit with Ador will return to the headlines next week when the hearings begin - and so will all five of them.",
      "The one thing that seems constant is their determination to get through this together.",
      "Two weeks ago, Hanni had said: \"We've always said to each other, if one person doesn't want to do it, then we're not going to do it. It has to be all all five of us that agrees to do it. That's how we've gotten here and that's how we are going to get to the end.\"",

      "The government has agreed a new funding package with pharmacy negotiators in England, leading some pharmacies to call off protests that were planned for later this week.",
      "One group representing thousands of local pharmacies was preparing to take action involving cuts to opening hours from Tuesday, but they say that will be delayed while they consider the deal.",
      "Others have said the funding package is a \"step in the right direction\" but it still will not cover all cost increases pharmacies are facing, including a rise in National Insurance.",
      "Announcing the deal, ministers said they were working to turn around a \"decade of underfunding and neglect\".",
      "Community pharmacies have been warning of closures and cutbacks in the face of what they say are unsustainable pressures.",
      "Among these are a rising workload, funding which has not kept pace with inflation and the prospect of higher employer National Insurance contributions.",
      "And all this as they are expected to help more patients with some conditions to take the pressure off GPs.",
      "Government funding for pharmacies in England stood at \u00a32.6bn in 2019/20. But over the next few years that did not go up with inflation.",
      "In the current financial year (2024/25) it has been at \u00a32.7bn.",
      "The government has now announced a new deal for pharmacies in England, which will see funding rise to \u00a33.1bn next year (2025/26).",
      "The deal will also include more mental health support for patients and increased consultations and blood pressure checks.",
      "And the deal includes a plan \u2013 announced on Sunday \u2013 to enable women to get the morning-after pill for free from pharmacies.",
      "As part of the deal, the government will also write off \u00a3193 million of debt for community pharmacy owners.",
      "Health Minister Stephen Kinnock said: \"We're working to turn around a decade of underfunding and neglect that has left the sector on the brink of collapse.",
      "\"This package of record investment and reform is a vital first step to getting community pharmacies back on their feet and fit for the future.\"",
      "There was a cautious welcome from representatives of High Street chemists but warnings that the extra funding would not be enough to cover rising costs.",
      "Leyla Hannbeck, chief executive of the Independent Pharmacies Association, said the government's announcement was a \"welcome step in the right direction\" but it \"does not alleviate pressures and will not stop closures\".",
      "Community pharmacies in England are \"on life support\", she said, adding the rise in National Insurance and business rates makes the situation \"even more acute\".",
      "Another community pharmacy group, the National Pharmacy Association (NPA), had announced that protest action would begin on Tuesday.",
      "It had previously warned that pharmacists were facing a \"financial cliff edge\" from 1 April, when many of their costs are due to rise.",
      "The NPA advised about 6,000 members in England to start \"working to rule\" from this date.",
      "This was due to involve cutting opening hours to around 40 hours a week \u2013 the minimum required under their contracts \u2013 and would have meant possible weekend closures.",
      "But the organisation says that this will be delayed while it consults members on the new deal.",
      "NPA chair Nick Kaye said Monday's announcement was a \"step forward\".",
      "\"However, the truth is that because of a decade of neglect it also falls a long way short of the NHS's own estimates of the true cost of providing pharmacy services,\" he added.",

      "In the 12 weeks since The Thistle opened in the east end of Glasgow, there have been 16 such overdose incidents.",
      "A total of 180 people have visited the unit and more than 1,200 injections of street-bought heroin and cocaine have been supervised.",
      "A total of 27 people have been referred to other services, including housing, by staff.",
      "The service, which follows similar programmes in 18 other countries, seeks to reduce drug-related harm in a hardcore population of injecting users in one of the most deprived communities in Glasgow.",
      "It is hoped that by providing a safer space it will allow medical staff to prevent overdose deaths, reduce blood-borne viruses and clean-up a local area that, historically, has had a major issue with discarded needles and drug debris.",
      "David Clark has been using drugs for 26 years and has spent long periods of his life on the streets.",
      "He allowed BBC Scotland to follow his progress over a three-month period as he attempted to move on from a city centre hostel and stop using heroin and cocaine.",
      "The 47-year-old told Disclosure he used The Thistle service to inject cocaine in February.",
      "From there, staff referred him to new supported accommodation. At the time of his interview, he had been abstinent for two weeks.",

      "He says the facility is \"brilliant\".",

      "Linda Watson, one of the most vocal residents, said the centre was already attracting more people to the area to use drugs.",
      "She took Disclosure on a tour of Calton's known using spots and said there was evidence of freshly discarded needles.",
      "Linda also expressed anger at a lack of investment in the area.",
      "\"When we were going to the meetings at first, the drug workers were: 'We are providing a facility for your community, this will make your community better'.",

      "\"The Thistle will hopefully reduce the drug-related death rates for the population that it serves. But that is a relatively small population compared with Scotland as a whole.",
      "\"Its contribution to the national drug death figures won't be very significant. We have to be honest about that.\"",
      "Dr Priyadarshi said much of the anger emanating from the community related to a lack of resources for other services in the area.",
      "\"Sometimes I worry that the focus on residential rehab or drug consumption rooms, a focus on debates and discussions about this, takes our eyes off the bigger picture,\" he added.",

      "The research made an impact, as my Instagram feed and WhatsApp groups were flooded with links to the study, warning of the alleged risks hidden in our hair.",
      "One of the messages was from my cousin, Rochelle, who does her braids herself every other month.",
      "\"Braids, famously, are called a protective style,\" she later told me.",
      "It's a term typically used to describe several Afro hairstyles, including braids, locs and wigs, that reduce how much your hair is exposed to the elements and cut back on constant styling.",
      "\"The fact that this style is doing everything but protect us - it's actually harming us - is actually quite wild to me.\"",
      "It is the lack of awareness among black women that is most concerning, she adds.",
      "\"People that are eating unhealthy food or smoking, they know that what they're doing could harm their body, whereas if you're putting braids in your hair, you're not thinking that it's harming you.\"",
      "James Rogers, the head of product safety testing at Consumer Reports, says that the results are a cause for concern because women have \"constant contact\" with harmful chemicals if their hair is in braids, often for months at a time.",
      "\"We believe that whenever you're exposed to harmful chemicals, that it's cumulative - it all adds up.\"",
      "But he also emphasised that more research was needed, saying: \"We're hoping that this begins the conversation, not only at the regulatory level, but also amongst our own communities, about sharing accurate information.\"",
      "Here at Jos\u00e9e's Professional Braiding Studio in north London, the study certainly isn't putting clients off.",
      "Jos\u00e9e and her daughters Abigail and Naomi, who work with her in the salon, have seen interest from new customers, especially after they helped to create the wig worn by Elphaba in Wicked, one of highest-grossing movies of 2024.",
      "\"People were shocked by how versatile we can be with our braiding,\" Abigail tells me, adding that her mum received several messages from clients telling them how proud they were.",
      "Jos\u00e9e says that while the findings are \"worrying\", it has been business as usual at the salon.",
      "Some of her customers, however, have been rattled by the research.",
      "It's Kellie-Ann's first time getting her braids done at Jos\u00e9e's salon, but she has been wearing the style since she was a child.",
      "She tells me she felt betrayed after reading the study: \"I think it's awful that companies have been doing this for years to black women and I think we deserve better.\"",
      "She's now seeking out brands free from harmful chemicals and plastic - and says many of her friends are doing the same.",
      "\"A lot of women I've spoken to about it have agreed that biogradable would be better - it's good for the planet as well.\"",
      "Ifeanyi has also worn braids since childhood, and says they are the easiest and most convenient style to handle while she's busy studying at university.",
      "She argues that the study is not alarming, pointing out that people may come into contact with carcinogens every day, in certain processed foods, alcohol and tobacco.",
      "\"Obviously you want be cautious - I just think that it's not necessarily something to completely abandon the style or the hair for.\"",
      "She's concerned that the social media posts she has seen will \"scare people out of wanting to engage\", to the detriment of a critical source of income for black entrepreneurs working in the hair industry.",
      "In 2021 Treasure Tress, a UK-based beauty subscription for black hair, found that black British women spent \u00a3168m a year on hair products. Earlier research by L'Oreal suggested that black women in the UK spend six times more on their hair than white women.",
      "\"I'd like to see more of a commitment to making sure that things are safer for us, rather than telling us that some of our historical, traditional practices as black women are wrong,\" Ifeanyi says.",

      "Tendai Moyo co-founded Ruka Hair in 2021, which specialises in extensions made from natural hair sourced from South East Asia, as well as biodegradable synthetic hair, made from collagen fibre.",
      "She tells me they have seen a \"huge uptick in demand\", especially in the US, where the study was published.",
      "But she sees this as part of a wider trend, which stretches beyond concerns raised by the new research.",
      "\"We launched in the pandemic, and people were like, 'Oh, but salons are closed', but we were selling out because people don't stop doing their hair.\"",
      "She tells me that black women \"got to experiment\" more with their hair during lockdown and were more willing to try out new products.",
      "One of the biggest draws of traditional synthetic hair brands, however, is their low price, which has made experimenting with different styles and colours affordable for years.",
      "But newer brands tend to have a higher price point - Tendai tells me that Ruka's most popular synthetic hair type costs around 2.5 times more than several high street brands.",
      "Ifeanyi says that, as a student, brands like Ruka are out of reach for her: \"To purchase the hair is equivalent to the amount it would cost you to get the hairstyle done, so you're essentially doubling the price.\"",
      "Tendai defends this by comparing it to choosing between \"fast food and healthy food\".",
      "She adds: \"You can actually reuse our products if you'd like, and therefore you're saving money in that way.\"",
      "Back at Jos\u00e9e's salon, Naomi tells me that braiding is not just an important source of income, but a valued cultural practice that brings her family together.",
      "\"I call myself a braid baby because I've been braiding since I was 6 years old,\" she says, telling me how her family would bond over the skill as her mum proudly looks on.",
      "\"It's an empowering service to offer,\" she adds, saying that it's gratifying to do a job that leaves other women feeling uplifted.",
      "Despite growing concerns about the effect it could have on our health, braiding is a precious heirloom for this family - and for many other black women - passed down from generation to generation.",

    "story": [
      "An NHS trust criticised over the avoidable death of a newborn baby was paid \u00a32m for providing good maternity care, the BBC can reveal.",
      "A senior coroner ruled on Friday that University Hospitals of Morecambe Bay (UHMB) NHS trust contributed to Ida Lock's death and had failed to learn lessons from previous maternity failures.",
      "Despite this, the trust claimed it had met all 10 standards under an NHS scheme aimed at promoting safe treatment.",
      "Ida's mother Sarah Robinson said it was \"another kick in the teeth\" while her father Ryan Lock labelled it \"disgusting\". The trust, which has previously apologised for its failings in Ida's care, declined to comment about the NHS payment scheme.",
      "Senior coroner for Lancashire James Adeley concluded that Ida had died due to the gross failure of three midwives to provide basic medical care.",
      "Ida, who was born at the Royal Lancaster Infirmary (RLI) on 9 November 2019, died a week later after suffering a serious brain injury due to a lack of oxygen.",
      "Dr Adeley ruled her death had been caused by the midwives' failure to deliver the infant \"urgently when it was apparent she was in distress\" and contributed to by the lead midwife's \"wholly incompetent failure to provide basic neonatal resuscitation\".",
      "He said eight opportunities had been missed \"to alter Ida's clinical course\".",
      "Her five-week inquest at Preston County Hall heard that many of the issues identified in a 2015 independent review of UHMB's maternity services were still evident in November 2019.",
      "The RLI is run by the UHMB trust.",
      "'Critical inspection'",
      "Under the Maternity Incentive Scheme run by NHS Resolution, the health service's insurance arm, maternity departments in England are encouraged to provide good care by meeting 10 safety standards, including properly investigating deaths and listening to parents' concerns.",
      "Trusts which certify they have met these standards receive a rebate on their insurance premiums, in addition to a share of money paid by NHS trusts which do not.",
      "In the five years that the scheme has been running, UHMB said it had met the 10 standards four times.",
      "In 2018, the first year of the programme, the trust's self-certification led to it being paid \u00a31,288,241.",
      "In 2019, the year of Ida's death, it received \u00a3734,112 after again claiming to have hit all of the criteria.",
      "The UHMB trust also claimed a perfect 10-out-of-10 record in 2020 but their submission was reviewed by NHS Resolution following a critical inspection of maternity services by the Care Quality Commission.",
      "The regulator's report rated maternity services as \"inadequate\", with UHMB's score downgraded to three out of 10.",
      "Consequently, UHMB was not given any money that year by NHS Resolution, and the trust was made to repay most of the amount it had received in 2019.",
      "'Painting a false picture'",
      "When told about the payments scheme and how the trust had benefitted from it, Mr Lock said it was \"disgusting\".",
      "He said: \"It's painting a false picture so they can receive money.\"",
      "A former maternity risk manager at the trust, Rox-Anne Hetherington, said Morecambe Bay's actions were in keeping with her experience.",
      "\"I can, hand-on-heart, say that it wasn't a case of 'What have we done to [make things better]?'",
      "\"It was a case of 'What are we going to say we've done?'\"",
      "Dr Bill Kirkup, whose 2015 inquiry exposed widespread failings in maternity care, including the preventable deaths of 11 babies and a mother at the trust's Furness General Hospital in Cumbria, also said he wasn't surprised.",
      "\"Some trusts put a lot of effort into how they can present the best picture of themselves, and much less effort into whether they're actually making improvements underneath,\" he said.",
      "'Not fully compliant'",
      "UHMB's claims are in line with other struggling trusts which have also made similar erroneous submissions under the Maternity Incentive Scheme.",
      "The Shrewsbury and Telford NHS trust was forced to repay almost \u00a31m after it similarly claimed to have met all of the safety standards.",
      "A review of its maternity care, published in 2022, found more than 200 babies and mothers could have survived with proper care.",
      "The East Kent University Hospitals trust, where an inquiry found at least 45 babies could have survived, was also forced to repay \u00a32m after falsely claiming it had met the safety criteria.",
      "In a statement, NHS Resolution said \"University Hospitals of Morecambe Bay NHS trust initially self-reported full compliance with the Maternity Incentive Scheme in years 1, 2, 3 and 5.",
      "\"However subsequent NHS Resolution reviews of the Trust's evidence for years 2 and 3 following the publication of their CQC report demonstrated that they were not fully compliant for those years.",

      "There are two elements - a daily living component and a mobility component. Claimants may be eligible for one or both.",
      "Under the government's proposals, assessments for the daily living part will be tightened, which the official forecaster - the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) - says will affect around 800,000 people.",
      "Pip assessments involve questions about tasks like preparing and eating food, washing and getting dressed. Each is scored on a scale from zero - for no difficulty - to 12 - for the most severe - by a health professional.",
      "From November 2026, the government says people will need to score at least four points for one activity, instead of qualifying for support with a score that could describe less severe difficulties (ones and twos) across a broad range of tasks.",
      "For example, needing help to wash your hair, or your body below the waist, would be awarded two points, but needing help to wash between the shoulders and waist would equate to four points.",

      "The basic level of universal credit is worth \u00a3393.45 a month to a single person who is 25 or over.",
      "But if you have limited capacity to work because of a disability or long term condition, this payment more than doubles, because of an extra top up worth \u00a3416.19.",
      "Under the government's proposals, claimants will not be eligible to get this incapacity top-up until they are aged 22 or over.",
      "New claimants will also see this top-up fall from \u00a397 extra per week in 2025-26 to \u00a350 a week by 2026-27, before being frozen until the end of 2029-30.",
      "The higher rate for existing health-related claimants will also be frozen for the same period.",
      "At the same time, the basic payment level for universal credit will rise. When the government first set out its plans, it said it would rise to \u00a3107 a week by 2029-30, but the Spring Statement confirmed it would go up to \u00a3106.",

      "In addition, the DWP says 3.8 million families will gain an average of \u00a3420 a year as a result of the increase in the standard UC allowance and changes to the assessment process.",
      "What is being done to get more people into work?",
      "The government says it wants to help those who can work back into employment, while doing more to protect those with severe conditions who are unable to do so.",
      "As part of this it will invest \u00a31bn in what it calls \"high-quality, tailored and personalised support\" to help people find jobs.",
      "A number of changes have been announced which the government hopes will break the link between trying to get into work and losing benefits.",
      "The work capability assessment, which checks eligibility for the health related top-up to universal credit, will be scrapped by 2028.",
      "Instead, claimants will have to go through the Pip system to claim for a health benefit. The government says they will be assessed on how their disability affects their daily life, rather than on their capacity to work.",
      "While you can receive universal credit or Pip while in employment, universal credit is means-tested and tapers off as earnings increase, while Pip is not affected by how much someone works or their level of savings.",
      "A new \"right to try\" system will mean people will not be financially penalised if they take a job which doesn't work out.",
      "The government will also consult on merging employment and support allowance and jobseeker's allowance into a single time-limited benefit that is not means-tested. This would be more generous but available for a shorter period.",
      "\"If you have paid into the system, you'll get stronger income protection while we help you get back on track,\" Work and Pensions Secretary Liz Kendall said.",
      "Why does the government want to cut welfare spending?",
      "Overall, the government currently spends \u00a365bn a year on health and disability-related benefits. Before the government announced the Pip and UC changes, this was projected to increase to \u00a3100bn by 2029.",
      "Pip is the second-largest element of the working-age welfare bill, with spending due to almost double to \u00a334bn by 2029-30.",
      "When Pip was introduced in 2013, the aim was to save \u00a31.4bn a year by reducing the number of people eligible for payments. However, initial savings were modest and the number of claimants has risen.",
      "About 1.3m people now claim disability benefits primarily for mental health or behavioural conditions.",
      "That is 44% of all working age claimants, according to the independent economic think-tank, the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS).",
      "The OBR now predicts welfare spending on working-age adults will be \u00a372.3bn by 2029-2030. Spending on pensioners and children is expected to be \u00a325.4bn.",

    "story": [
      "New rules on sentencing criminals from ethnic minorities have been abandoned following a weeks-long standoff between senior judges and the government.",
      "Shabana Mahmood, the justice secretary, believed the proposals from top judges would have created a \"two-tier\" justice system.",
      "The new guidelines, which had been in development for months, told judges to seek extra information before deciding how to punish offenders from certain minority groups.",
      "The proposals had sparked condemnation from politicians across both main parties in recent weeks and, following the Sentencing Council refusing Mahmood's demands to reconsider, she was set to overrule them with emergency legislation.",
      "The Council, made up of some of the most senior legal figures in England and Wales, was adamant that the guidelines would have helped address disparities between how different ethnicities are treated in the justice system.",
      "The new rules, which would have been binding on judges, were set to take effect on Tuesday but were delayed on Monday because of the inevitability that they would be overturned by parliament anyway.",
      "Government sources had said it would be all but impossible to pass such legislation before Parliament breaks for Easter.",
      "In a statement, the Sentencing Council said its chairman, Lord Justice William Davis, met Justice Secretary Shabana Mahmood on Monday morning.",
      "In the meeting, Lord Davis indicated the guidelines would not be brought in while there was a \"draft bill due for imminent introduction that would make it unlawful\".",
      "\"On that basis, the council, an independent statutory body, has chosen to delay the in force date of the guideline pending such legislation taking effect,\" the statement said.",
      "Mahmood said she was \"grateful\" to the Sentencing Council for delaying the implementation of its new guidelines.",
      "The minister said: \"These guidelines create a justice system where outcomes could be influenced by race, culture or religion.",

      "The Sentencing Council, made up of some of the most senior legal figures in England and Wales, said the guidance would address disparities in the punishments meted out by judges.",
      "Official figures show that offenders from ethnic minorities consistently get longer sentences than white offenders for indictable offences.",

    "story": [
      "The UK is expecting to be hit by new US tariffs on Wednesday, with Downing Street indicating a deal to exempt British goods will not be reached in time.",
      "US President Donald Trump has said he plans to unveil a raft of new tariffs - or import taxes - on 2 April, on top of a 25% levy on car and car parts which has already been announced.",
      "Over the weekend he suggested the tariffs would hit all countries, not just those with the biggest trade imbalances with the US.",
      "The prime minister's official spokesman said talks on an economic deal between the two countries to avoid tariffs had been \"constructive\" but he did not rule out retaliating if they were imposed on the UK.",
      "\"When it comes to tariffs, the prime minister has been clear he will always act in the national interest and we've been preparing for all eventualities ahead of the announcement from President Trump, which we would expect the UK to be impacted by alongside other countries,\" he said.",

      "Pressed on whether the government was hopeful of a deal to avert tariffs being reached by Wednesday, the spokesman said discussions between the UK and the US \"will likely continue beyond Wednesday\".",
      "He said the UK would \"take a calm and pragmatic approach\" in response to any tariffs, arguing \"a trade war with the US is not in anybody's interests\".",
      "But he added: \"We rule nothing out in response.\"",

      "Global shares slide as Trump tariffs loom",

      "\"Labour claims talks with the US are going \"well\". But, if this is what well looks like, I wouldn't like to see what the opposite looks like. The prime minister has so far failed to come up with the goods, he needs to rekindle our US trade deal.\"",
      "The Liberal Democrats have urged the government to hit back with its own tariffs, as Canada and the European Union have already done.",
      "The party's leader Sir Ed Davey said: \"Just asking nicely clearly doesn't work with Trump, so we have to stand tall with our allies in Canada and Europe and show that we will not be bullied.",
      "\"That means being prepared to impose reciprocal tariffs if necessary, including on Elon Musk's Teslas, and urgently negotiating a better trade deal with the EU to show Trump we have alternatives.\"",
      "It comes after Sir Keir Starmer spoke to Trump over the phone on Sunday, with Downing Street saying the pair had \"productive negotiations\" about an economic deal.",
      "The government has argued the UK has a relatively equal trading relationship with the US, compared to its other partners.",
      "The independent Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) has warned a reciprocal trade war would wipe billions off economic growth and all but eliminate the headroom Chancellor Rachel Reeves has to stay within her self-imposed rules on spending and borrowing.",
      "This could lead to further tax rises or spending cuts if she wanted to avoid breaking her fiscal rules.",
      "The OBR's latest economic forecast, published on Wednesday, said GDP would be 0.6% lower than forecast this year and 1% lower next year in the most \"severe\" scenario, in which the UK and other nations retaliated to Trump's tariffs.",
      "In an alternative scenario where the UK does not retaliate, the OBR has forecast a smaller reduction in growth, with GDP 0.4% lower than expected this year and 0.6% lower next year.",
      "It is unclear how the UK would retaliate if tariffs do come into effect. There are a range of options available, from duties on sectors where British products are particularly important to the US, to focusing on specific products like Harley Davidson motorcycles.",
      "UK car exports are worth about \u00a37.6bn per year, and the US is the second largest market for UK cars after the European Union, according to car industry body the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT).",

      "The US president argues his measures will help American manufacturers and protect jobs, despite warnings prices could go up for consumers.",
      "During a meeting between the prime minister and president at the White House last month, Trump hinted at \"a real trade deal\", which could see the UK avoid the kind of tariffs he has been threatening other countries with.",
      "What impact could tariffs have on the UK?",
      "by Dharshini David, deputy economics editor",
      "The impact of a US tariff on all British goods is very uncertain. It depends on not just on the scale of any tariffs applied on British products, but how the government, businesses and consumers react.",
      "As the car industry knows already, tariffs are extremely worrying for the industries affected - as an exporter you hope that either some of it can be soaked up in the supply chain or your American customers will be happy to pay higher prices - or you take a hit to your own profits by lowering prices.",
      "Or you may lose sales, tariffs are undeniably bad news for exporters in the firing line.",
      "But their impact on prices in the UK is uncertain. If the UK government retaliates with tariffs on American products, households here could face rises. But countries such as China, if disadvantaged by American tariffs, could try to send their goods here instead, pushing down prices.",
      "Broadly, US tariffs would be detrimental to UK growth. Without retaliatory tariffs, the UK's official forecasters reckon that 0.6% could be knocked off UK growth next year - unhelpful but not disastrous. Underpinning that scenario is a number of assumptions.",
      "But, as it cautions, there are so many uncertainties about not just the policy, but how it would filter through."

      "She argued it was a way to continue doing \"normal everyday things\" with her family whilst respecting her security needs as chancellor.",

      "Speaking to ITV, she said she was unable to buy regular tickets for security reasons and had been offered the box tickets by AEG, which owns the arena.",
      "She did not confirm which member of her family attended the concert with her, but added that she faced a \"balancing act in my job to try and be a good parent\" alongside her security needs she now faces in her Treasury job.",
      "\"I felt I was doing the right thing, but I do understand perceptions,\" she said, adding: \"I recognise the feeling here. I have no intention of doing that again.\"",

      "'Weird'",
      "Ministers are not banned from accepting gifts, as long as they are declared, but under new rules they must consider the need to maintain public trust.",
      "The tickets have been declared on Reeves's public register of interests, which shows she accepted them on 8 March and registered them 10 days later.",
      "Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer had backed the chancellor on Monday, saying \"everything she has done is according to the rules\".",

      "\"But I do want to carry on doing the things that normal parents do with their kids, and that gave me the opportunity to do that,\"",
      "Speaking at a news conference on Wednesday, she said she had been advised it would be \"better for security reasons\" for her to watch the concert from a box.",
      "\"That's the reason why I did that, rather than just being in normal seats, which to be honest, for me and my family, would have been a lot nicer and a lot easier\".",

      "The figure, released by the Department for Work and Pensions, is an increase of 100,000 children from the previous year - and equates to 31% of children in the UK.",
      "The figure has risen sharply since 2021 and the Child Poverty Action Group (CPAG) predicts 4.8 million children will be in poverty by the end of this Parliament in 2029-30.",
      "It is calling for the government to scrap the two-child benefit limit in its upcoming child poverty strategy, and to pause the recent proposals for wider benefit cuts.",
      "The two-child cap prevents parents from claiming universal credit or child tax credit for a third child, with a few exemptions.",

      "He added: \"We're going to be addressing that\".",
      "Chancellor Rachel Reeves confirmed a shake-up to the benefits system on Wednesday. This includes halving incapacity benefits for new claimants, and tighter criteria around the Personal Independence Payment for those with long term physical or mental health conditions.",
      "An extra 250,000 people, including 50,000 children, will be pushed into relative poverty by these changes, according to the government's own impact assessment.",
      "In the three years to 2024, the highest child poverty rates after housing costs were in the West Midlands and London, although London's levels were among the lowest if housing was not factored in.",
      "One in five families who had one child were living in poverty, compared with 44% of those who had three children or more.",
      "The Resolution Foundation echoed calls for the government to scrap the two-child benefit limit and wants the government to extend free school meal entitlement to all families on Universal Credit.",
      "When Labour took power in the summer of 2024, after the period covered by the figures, the prime minister announced the creation of a child poverty task force, promising to leave \"no stone unturned\" in tackling the root causes of the issue.",
      "The cross-government child poverty strategy is due to be published in spring 2025.",
      "\"No-one should be living in poverty, and we know that the best route out of poverty for struggling families is well paid, secure work, a Department for Work and Pensions spokesperson said.",

      "This meant Britain departing from the post World War Two consensus that government should control the economy and that instead if you left the markets alone, they would deliver the country greater prosperity and security.",
      "If, in 2025, the idea sounds anything but radical, that's exactly the point.",
      "What we saw in the UK in the 1980s under Margaret Thatcher's government was just how quickly the free market transitioned from a radical idea into the new reality. Then before long it became what many assumed was the system that would last forever.",
      "US President Donald Trump is a billionaire businessman who has clearly done well financially out of capitalism. But suddenly, thanks in part to him, the free market system finds itself under assault like never before.",
      "It might yet weather the storm. However others are asking, is the free market system fatally flawed and doomed to failure?",
      "The fantasy world of Thatcher's Britain",
      "So much of what Thatcher did in the wake of her 1983 general election victory seems so obvious now. We take it for granted that private companies play a pivotal role in providing our water, electricity, gas, railways, ports and freight.",
      "But at the time few believed it possible to do what she had done - it seemed like a fantasy world, completely detached from how things had been done post war.",
      "I was six when the war ended. There was rationing \u2013 coupons that allowed you to buy meat or clothes, or of course, sweets. But out of these hard times and on the heels of victory, a new vision of society was emerging in Britain.",
      "With Clement Attlee's landslide election victory in July 1945, for the first time in Britain's political history a majority cast their votes for a party ostensibly dedicated to socialism.",
      "But more than that, a new consensus on how the country should run emerged, with those leading the Labour and Conservative parties singing from a broadly similar sheet.",
      "\"We have built our defences against want and sickness, and we're proud of it,\" was uttered not by a Labour prime minister but by Harold Macmillan, Conservative prime minister from 1957 to 1963. This had been how things were done.",
      "However not everyone bought into the consensus. Antony Fisher, who was a chicken farmer, was exasperated by what he saw as the meddling of the Egg Marketing Board. He set up the Institute of Economic Affairs think tank, inspired Keith Joseph and he in turn got Thatcher's ear.",
      "Trump's admiration of Thatcher",
      "That the current assault on the free market is coming, in part, from a Republican US president seems all the more ironic given how popular Thatcher's reforms were with the American right.",
      "Thatcher and President Ronald Reagan shared a similar world view, and Trump has spoken of his admiration for the two, albeit with the caveat that he didn't agree with some of Reagan's trade policies.",
      "Thatcher was convinced that the country would be much better off if gas and water and electricity were taken out of the hands of the state. And sold on the open market. The free market. Just like buying a loaf of bread.",
      "The Thatcher government's big idea was that they weren't just going to sell the shares in state-owned utilities to big businesses or investors. They were going to offer them to the British people.",
      "In December 1984 shares in British Telecom (BT) went on sale. The next morning, the numbers were staggering: more than two million Britons were now BT shareholders.",
      "And Thatcher began to realise that selling off these companies wasn't just about breaking the shackles of government control. It could be something bigger - turning every person in Britain into a capitalist and in doing so making capitalism popular.",
      "In Britain, by the end of the 1980s, the scale of transformation was staggering. The sum of \u00a360bn was raised by selling off state run companies. Up to 15 million Britons were now shareholders.",
      "Britain was embracing the free market. This wasn't just an economic shift. It was a cultural revolution. A redefinition of Britain's relationship with money, with government, and with itself.",
      "And if Thatcher's privatisation had given ordinary people the chance to buy shares, her reforms to Britain's financial services sector in 1986, known as the Big Bang, gave ordinary people the chance to sell them too, to get a job in the previously closed world of the City.",
      "There were many on the left for whom the principle alone of these reforms was something to object to. The assault on the free market from some on the right is not about the principles of the reforms, but the consequences.",
      "Offshore business and collapsing communities",
      "At the core of Thatcher's thinking was a belief that free market capitalism could work only if many people had a direct stake in it. And with share ownership of previously state run utilities, many people did. But before long, alarm bells were starting to be rung. And their chime has only gotten louder.",
      "James Goldsmith was a businessman who had made a fortune by buying struggling companies cheaply, reshaping them to maximise efficiency and then selling them at a profit. The 1980s reforms were like manna from heaven for him.",
      "But then he seemed to change his mind about things. In 1994 he told a committee of US senators that its premise contained a fatal flaw - that the system demanded maximum profit but to achieve maximum profit that meant severing the umbilical link with many of your own electorate.",
      "\"You get to a system whereby, to get the best corporate profits, you have to leave your own country. You have to say to your own sales force 'Goodbye, we can't use you anymore - you're too expensive'.",
      "\"You've got unions. You want holidays. You want protection. So we're going offshore.\"",
      "Goldsmith was predicting that companies would take their business wherever they would make the most money. If you are a CEO answerable to shareholders that's literally your job description. And the result, he said, would be job losses in the West, with communities collapsing.",
      "And to make things worse, he argued that Britain had ceded sovereignty to the likes of the European Union and the World Trade Organization, with Britain binding itself to an economic system run by unelected bureaucrats in Brussels, only adding to the sense of alienation felt in collapsing communities. And with global markets dictating policy. If an industry wasn't profitable, it was left to die.",
      "Today, the UK may be a global leader in science and financial services but is that of much consolation to communities where we once made things that are now made offshore?",
      "Based on what I often heard in my many years touring the country presenting Question Time, I'm not sure it is.",
      "Goldsmith would end up trying to go into politics. His Referendum Party was trounced in the 1997 general election but he had planted a seed. He had argued that the global free market path that Britain and the rest of the world was going down was dangerous. That it would spread division around the world.",
      "Fast-forward nearly 20 years to 2016 and his warning came to pass. Britain voted to leave the European Union and the verdict could not be clearer: the Leave vote was highest in those left-behind communities, seemingly fuelled by those who felt globalisation was not working for them.",
      "The dream of a nation of shareholders has soured too.",
      "In 1989 Thames Water was privatised. We were promised lower bills, better infrastructure, less red tape and investment in a system fraying at the edges. It was investment that the global capitalist system was supposedly best placed to provide.",
      "What followed was something else entirely. Debt ballooned and dividends flowed to shareholders. The company extracted profit while pipes leaked and sewage poured into rivers. And our bills now pay for interest on that debt - it feels like we've come a long way from Thatcher's nation of shareholders.",
      "Trump's tariffs 'defy easy explanation'",
      "Back in 1994, James Goldsmith had posited that the problem with the free market dream was that it didn't protect the home base.",
      "Now, there is someone else much more powerful who takes that view.",
      "President Trump's methods are so erratic that with him it's hard to tell what is going on. His readiness to slap hugely consequential tariffs on countries that are both traditional foes and supposed friends at times defies easy explanation.",
      "But what we can say is that he is trying to return to ideas that preceded the free market. He is trying to make America strong through protectionism, making it harder for anyone to simply sell anywhere.",
      "There is an argument that if you take the long view then perhaps the free market period is the outlier. Britain itself had a long, long period of protectionism before it embraced free trade.",
      "Tariffs are nothing new in world economic history and in a sense Trump is just trying to return the US to how things were, albeit in quite a chaotic way.",
      "The reign of the free market is facing its biggest ever challenge. But that challenge is coming not from supporters of socialism who ideologically back a big role for the state. Instead, the challenge is coming from Trump, a man who is broadly speaking of the right and has no qualms with capitalism allowing people to become very rich.",
      "That the challenge is coming from within is what makes it so potent.",

    "summary": "The UK's economic prospects are better than expected, but the forecasts are precarious and could easily be derailed.",
    "story": [
      "The story of this Spring Statement is that welfare has been cut back to make up for a notable rise in the cost of servicing the national debt. There is also a trim to the money being given to government departments.",
      "There is relatively little else actually happening in policy terms. There were no tax rises, no changes to Chancellor Rachel Reeves' borrowing rules and as expected, this was definitely not a Budget.",
      "The real question now is whether the chancellor can escape from a never-ending cycle of microhaggling with the government's independent forecaster the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) in this way, twice a year for the rest of the Parliament.",
      "When asked about whether new tax rises could now come in the Autumn like last year, she said emphatically: \"We'll never have to do a Budget like that again.\"",
      "But the numbers are precarious and extremely sensitive to the economic and political changes around the world.",
      "If the US imposes 20% tariffs on the UK next week, it could lead to a downgrade in UK growth and \"wipe out\" the \u00a39.9bn headroom the chancellor has to meet her borrowing rule, the OBR chairman, Richard Hughes, told me.",
      "Other uncertainties include higher interest rates and lower UK productivity, he said, adding that \"the risks are very elevated\".",
      "That is why growth, confidence, and comprehensive economic strategy is so important.",
      "By June there should be new plans for trade, industry and infrastructure. In the next few weeks, there could be an economic deal with the US, and the start of a Brexit reset with the EU.",
      "Despite the uncertainties, the OBR's judgement on the economy was better than had been expected. This year's growth was downgraded, but close to normal levels of growth are predicted to return in later years.",

      "At this stage this is not about an extra brick being laid or even planning approval, but it is a \"spreadsheet win\" that eased the chancellor's fiscal pain.",

      "The basic level of universal credit is worth \u00a3393.45 a month to a single person who is 25 or over.",
      "But if you have limited capacity to work because of a disability or long term condition, this payment more than doubles, because of an extra top up worth \u00a3416.19.",
      "Under the government's proposals, claimants will not be eligible to get this incapacity top-up until they are aged 22 or over.",
      "New claimants will also see this top-up fall from \u00a397 extra per week in 2025-26 to \u00a350 a week by 2026-27, before being frozen until the end of 2029-30.",
      "The higher rate for existing health-related claimants will also be frozen for the same period.",

      "In addition, the DWP says 3.8 million families will gain an average of \u00a3420 a year as a result of the increase in the standard UC allowance and changes to the assessment process.",
      "What is being done to get more people into work?",
      "The government says it wants to help those who can work back into employment, while doing more to protect those with severe conditions who are unable to do so.",

      "A number of changes have been announced which the government hopes will break the link between trying to get into work and losing benefits.",
      "The work capability assessment, which checks eligibility for the health related top-up to universal credit, will be scrapped by 2028.",
      "Instead, claimants will have to go through the Pip system to claim for a health benefit. The government says they will be assessed on how their disability affects their daily life, rather than on their capacity to work.",
      "While you can receive universal credit or Pip while in employment, universal credit is means-tested and tapers off as earnings increase, while Pip is not affected by how much someone works or their level of savings.",
      "A new \"right to try\" system will mean people will not be financially penalised if they take a job which doesn't work out.",
      "The government will also consult on merging employment and support allowance and jobseeker's allowance into a single time-limited benefit that is not means-tested. This would be more generous but available for a shorter period.",
      "\"If you have paid into the system, you'll get stronger income protection while we help you get back on track,\" Work and Pensions Secretary Liz Kendall said.",
      "Why does the government want to cut welfare spending?",
      "Overall, the government currently spends \u00a365bn a year on health and disability-related benefits. Before the government announced the Pip and UC changes, this was projected to increase to \u00a3100bn by 2029.",
      "Pip is the second-largest element of the working-age welfare bill, with spending due to almost double to \u00a334bn by 2029-30.",
      "When Pip was introduced in 2013, the aim was to save \u00a31.4bn a year by reducing the number of people eligible for payments. However, initial savings were modest and the number of claimants has risen.",
      "About 1.3m people now claim disability benefits primarily for mental health or behavioural conditions.",
      "That is 44% of all working age claimants, according to the independent economic think-tank, the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS).",
      "The OBR now predicts welfare spending on working-age adults will be \u00a372.3bn by 2029-2030. Spending on pensioners and children is expected to be \u00a325.4bn.",

    "story": [
      "\"Definitely not a Budget\" is the basic message emerging from the Treasury about the chancellor's upcoming economic statement.",
      "There will not just be no red box outside Number 11, there will only be a \"thin book\" of new policies with a \"light scorecard\" of measures with no further tax rises.",
      "So what is the point of this Spring Statement?",
      "It is principally a spring forecast from the government's official forecasters, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR). In that process it has had to take into account a slower economy than expected, and higher government borrowing costs.",
      "This OBR forecast has wiped out the room for manoeuvre against the \"non-negotiable\" rules Chancellor Rachel Reeves has set on government borrowing in the future. She has made a number of further adjustments to keep the numbers on track.",
      "Essentially low growth and higher borrowing costs have blown the budgetary numbers off course.",
      "We will hear a lot from the chancellor about how \"the world has changed\".",
      "The reality is this course correction is likely to have been required even before US President Donald Trump transformed global diplomacy and trade.",
      "When Reeves begins her statement at the despatch box, we will find out whether the chancellor can continue to rule out having to resort to tax rises, even in this \"changed world\".",
      "And if there is no return to spending austerity, then where does the money come from?",

      "Everything you need to know about the Spring Statement",
      "'As a student, \u00a3800 a month is quite tight'",
      "What are Rachel Reeves's borrowing rules?",
      "While no significant tax measures are expected, the chancellor may nonetheless leave the option on the table for the autumn Budget.",
      "Some economists do expect tax rises in the autumn, in particular to meet rising defence spending. There is talk of a \"conversation with the public\" on this matter.",
      "At her first Budget the chancellor rejected, for example, extending the Conservative freeze to income tax thresholds by another two years. The public could get a clear idea around this Spring Statement if that is back as an option.",
      "The \u00a35bn cut to welfare spending already announced is the biggest single welfare cut for a decade. That is likely to be the biggest saving. The chancellor is now set to expand the cuts after being told reforms to the system would save less than planned.",
      "Later on Wednesday, the number of people losing Personal Independence Payments (PIP) and Universal Credit, how much on average, and the split between current or future recipients should be revealed. Hundreds of thousands will lose thousands of pounds worth of health-related benefits.",
      "There is a \u00a32.2bn cut to civil service admin costs, including staffing by 2029-30. A 15% cut is a significant chunk of what is spent by central government on wages and consultants.",
      "However, the chancellor suggested a loss of 10,000 roles, which is only a pruning of a workforce of over half a million - especially as it sees 30-40,000 leavers every year.",
      "The unions say this cannot be done without harming front line services. There is a lot riding here on deployment of automation and Artificial Intelligence (AI).",
      "A further fractional trim to the rise in departmental budgets, a crackdown on tax avoidance, and the switch from aid to defence spending should all help restore the chancellor's room for manoeuvre by another few billion pounds.",
      "It will be difficult to characterise this as \"austerity\" given the early injection of significant upfront sums into public spending at the Budget.",
      "Divvying up the increase in defence spending will be a key feature of the Spring Statement.",
      "Defence spending (for example, on jets and tanks) is more capital intensive than aid spending, so more of it is exempted from the chancellor's self-imposed borrowing rules to limit day-to-day spending only to what is raised in taxes.",
      "Growth downgrade",
      "Understandably there will be a lot of focus on a chunky downgrade to the OBR forecast for the economy in 2025.",
      "The real question for the chancellor has been the extent to which that has carried through to the end of the forecast period, and so permanently dented the economy and tax revenues. It may have not, and therefore not impact the Budget numbers quite so much.",
      "The Treasury has also been trying to get the OBR to give it credit for growth-enhancing reforms such as planning changes.",
      "In theory, higher growth means lower forecast borrowing and more room for manoeuvre - a win-win. But the OBR may have become stricter on this after a recent external review of its methods.",
      "There is a bigger picture here about growth and the government's strategy. Investors and business are still awaiting the infrastructure, industrial and trade strategies of this government eight months since it took power.",
      "The new global reality means further uncertainty, but also creates a potential significant upside for a stable, rules-based advanced economy with cutting-edge frontier science, research and financial services.",
      "This is particularly the case for a nation that can simultaneously keep its trade and investment connections with the US, Europe, China and the Gulf, even amid the tariff tumult. In Cabinet they call it \"the most connected economy in the world\".",
      "Is the world hearing this? UK Government borrowing costs have risen again as markets await the new calendar of bond sales on Wednesday.",
      "UK bond yields went up with the US in January, but when that stopped they also rose in line with Europe after massive debt-fuelled rearmament plans. It's the worst of both worlds for the borrowing forecast.",
      "The Spring Statement might be an opportunity to project the opposite case - that the UK is uniquely placed to be the best of both worlds. Some sort of economic deal with the US is imminent, and talks over the Brexit reset are also progressing.",
      "There are some small signs of the economy breaking out of its recent rut, especially in the service sector. Small businesses in retail and hospitality fearing the rises to National Insurance and the National Living Wage are holding out for some sort of alleviation of the pain.",
      "So Wednesday, while definitely not a Budget, will answer some important questions about the economy."

    "story": [
      "Sewage spilled illegally into England's largest lake on a record number of days last year, an analysis of water company data by campaigners suggests.",
      "The analysis, which the BBC had exclusive access to, used United Utilities operational data to establish when the company was discharging sewage into Windermere when it should by law have been treating some of it.",
      "The campaigners from Windrush Against Sewage Pollution (WASP) and Save Windermere identified 140 illegal spill days in 2024, more than in any of the three previous years.",
      "United Utilities told BBC News that the campaigners' findings were \"inaccurate\" and some of the data \"erroneous\".",
      "The company declined to put in writing, despite repeated requests, any specific examples of mistakes or omissions.",
      "Regulators Ofwat and the Environment Agency are both currently investigating United Utilities operations.",
      "Sewage dumped illegally in Windermere over 3 years",
      "Government vows to clean up England's largest lake",
      "Water firm behind spills says fixes will take time",
      "Part of the Lake District National Park Unesco World Heritage Site, Windermere is home to more than 14,000 people and its scenery attracts an estimated seven million visitors per year.",
      "But its pristine image is under threat. Regular discharges of sewage into Windermere have been blamed for increasing nutrient levels and turning parts of the lake green \u2013 so called \"algal blooming.\"",
      "The BBC has regularly reported on discharges into Windermere. Last October it was revealed that a single pumping station had illegally spilled more than 140 million litres of raw sewage between 2020 and 2023. In 2023 BBC Panorama said United Utilities was misreporting pollution incidents.",
      "Earlier in March environment secretary Steve Reed called the amount of pollution entering the lake \"a disgrace\" and pledged to clean it up.",
      "Last week the Environment Agency said United Utilities had spilled 77,817 times in 2024, the highest figure of all England's water companies.",
      "Many of the spills will have been legal. All water companies are legally allowed to discharge raw sewage to stop the network getting overwhelmed and this now happens regularly during periods of heavy rain.",
      "But almost all pumping stations and treatment plants operate under an environmental permit which specify that they must process or \"pass forward\" a certain amount of sewage and rainwater before spilling starts.",
      "The campaigners cross-referenced United Utilities datasets showing when an asset was spilling against how much sewage it was treating at the time. The campaigners' analysis \u2013 which has been shared with and scrutinised by the BBC -  found days when illegal spills appear to have occurred at each of six sewage facilities around the lake, which combined to 140 days in 2024. That's more than in any of the previous three years, as the chart below shows.",
      "The longest illegal spill the analysis identified was for 10 days from Hawkshead pumping station, which flows into Windermere via Cunsey Beck.",
      "\"This is an indication that their works have not been maintained properly or they're not being watched over properly,\" says Prof Peter Hammond, a mathematican and retired academic from campaign group Windrush Against Sewage Pollution.",
      "Prof Hammond's analysis of water company data has been cited by regulators and he has been praised in Parliament by water company executives for bringing problems to light they were previously unaware of.",
      "The latest analysis covers four years of data from six sites that discharge sewage into the Lake Windermere catchment.",
      "Comparisons over a longer time period are impossible as United Utilities has only had made full data sets available since 2021.",
      "The regulators Ofwat and the Environment Agency have since 2021 been investigating whether the water companies have been treating enough sewage before they start to spill. The EA call it a \"major criminal investigation\" while Ofwat call it \"the largest and most complex Ofwat has ever undertaken\".",
      "Last week Yorkshire Water agreed to a \u00a340m \"enforcement action\" after Ofwat uncovered \"serious failures\" in how it operated its treatment plant and network.",
      "Ofwat declined to comment on the campaigner's findings as their investigation into United Utilities is ongoing.",
      "In response to concerns about United Utilities the Environment Agency last year reviewed all of its environmental permits in the Windermere catchment and says this led directly to the water company tripling its investment plans for the area to \u00a3200m.",
      "\"We are currently carrying out investigations into suspected pollution incidents on the Windermere catchment and are unable to comment on these in detail until they have reached a conclusion,\" an EA spokesperson said when the campaigners' analysis was shared with them.",
      "\"Where we find breaches of environmental permits, we will take the appropriate enforcement action up to and including a criminal prosecution.\"",
      "United Utilities, which provides services to more than seven million people across north-west England, is more than \u00a39bn in debt. Its chief executive Louise Beardmore confirmed to parliament in February that she was last year paid \u00a31.4m including a bonus of \u00a3420,000.",
      "\"The methodology used by the campaigners is different to that used by the Environment Agency for its compliance assessments,\" the water company said in a statement.",
      "\"On top of that, erroneous data has been used, tags and naming conventions in data sets appear to have been misunderstood, and assumptions seem to have been made on whether different types of flow meters have been installed.\"",
      "\"The methodology fails to use other corroborating information from the sites which would prove that spills did not occur. As a result, the numbers quoted are inaccurate.\"",
      "BBC News presented United Utilities with five examples of illegal spills the campaigners' analysis had identified using the company's data and asked for any evidence or explanation as to why they were not illegal. United Utilities repeatedly declined to do so in writing or on camera.",
      "\"What we're seeing is the failure of privatisation. We're seeing a prioritisation of dividend returns over the long-term environmental protection of places like Windermere\" says Matt Staniek from Save Windermere.",
      "\"The bill payer has paid for a service that has never fully been provided, and the illegality demonstrates that for all to see.\"",
      "Over the next five years bills in the United Utilities area will go up by 32% above the rate of inflation. On average that will mean a rise of \u00a386 for the year that starts in April.",
      "Louise Beardmore said the rises will fund the \"largest investment in water and wastewater infrastructure in over 100 years\".",
      "For Windermere that's set to mean nine wastewater treatment works, including two that were included in the campaigners' analysis being upgraded and a reduction in the number of overflows discharging into the lake.",

    "story": [
      "Gothenburg, Sweden's second city, is highlighting its environmental credentials by continuing to put its money on the line.",
      "Back in 2022, the City of Gothenburg, became what is believed to be the first local government in the world to take out a \"sustainability linked loan\" or SLL.",
      "This is a form of financing pegged to a set of annual environmental and social improvements agreed between a borrower and its banks.",
      "Gothenburg's four target areas are efforts to make renewable energy the sole source of the city's heat production, making the council's own vehicle fleet electric, reducing energy usage in municipality-owned buildings, such as hospitals and schools, and improving the city's poorest neighbourhoods.",
      "Meet agreed annual improvement levels in these sectors and, for each, Gothenburg gets a discount on the yearly fee it pays for the loan of 0.1% or around 100,000 kronor ($10,500; \u00a38,000). But miss one of the targets by a certain amount and it has to pay a fine of the same amount.",
      "In 2022 and 2023 Gothenburg managed to avoid a financial penalty, but the newly released figures for 2024 show that it missed its target for switching to renewable energy. And so it is about to be fined 150,000 kroner.",
      "However, this is offset by the discounts it is getting for continuing to hit improvement levels for energy usage and social improvement. For electrifying the council's vehicles, while it missed its improvement goal, it didn't do so by enough to be fined.",
      "Fredrik Block, portfolio manager at the City of Gothenburg, says that the local authority deliberately set \"ambitious\" targets.",
      "\"You aim high, and you get the whole organisation to strive towards that target. We are not proceeding as fast as we expected, but we are taking one step at a time. The goal is still to be close to carbon-free by 2030.",
      "\"We're actually not doing it for the money. We're doing it to show the city's important work and that we are making progress every year. We want to show to the world how it is - that these are the problems, and these are the good things.\"",
      "The improvements to the city's poorest areas \u2013 and whether the council has hit its targets - are measured by yearly resident surveys. People are asked about their feelings towards an area's safety and cleanliness.",
      "Key initiatives have included making housing more secure, introducing more surveillance cameras and increasing police presence as a crime prevention measure in areas of the city like Hjallbo and Biskopsgarden. Located in the north of the city, they have high levels of crime and unemployment, and large immigrant populations.",
      "Public housing agency Framtiden, which is ultimately owned by the City of Gothenburg, says it takes the improvement work very seriously.",
      "\"For some of these vulnerable areas, we actually own the majority of the housing,\" says its research and development manager, Lars Bankvall.",
      "\"We are more or less the only official body in these areas. There's no one else there, only us.",
      "\"I see us as maybe the most powerful tool that the city has, because we have a lot of financial resources. We are involved in everything.\"",
      "But Faduma Awil, a social worker who now provides career coaching at an employment centre in Gothenburg, is concerned that increased cameras and police presence sends the wrong message to youth in Gothenburg's deprived areas - and could see racial profiling increase.",
      "\"What will our children think when they see cameras everywhere in Hjallbo, but none in a Swedish neighbourhood? How will they feel when they are constantly being watched by police?\" she says.",
      "\"What will you tell them? You are showing them there is a difference between them and native Swedes.\"",
      "Ms Awil is also not convinced the resident surveys are effective or accurate. And she feels the city is placing a disproportionate amount of effort into its environmental goals, at the expense of improving conditions in underprivileged areas.",
      "\"People in these areas don't care about the environment. They need to go to school. They need to work. They need to eat,\" says Ms Awil, who migrated from Somalia to Sweden in 1987 as a child.",
      "Negotiating an SLL is a rigorous, complex process - one that took the City of Gothenburg a year to do, with no fewer than six major Nordic banks involved.",
      "Such is the difficulty of acquiring an SLL that the number issued globally fell by 56% in 2023, according to data from financial news provider Bloomberg.",
      "Mats Olausson is senior sustainability advisor at Swedish bank SEB, which is the lead lender of Gothenburg's SLL.",
      "He says SEB has turned down potential SLL borrowers as the client's proposed targets weren't ambitious enough. Yet he adds that SLLs are challenging for companies or local authorities that successfully get one.",
      "\"It's sad if a company puts a lot of resources into designing an SLL, and then it turns out that the only publicity they get is negative,\" he says. \"You run the risk of being pulled into the dirt for having not done a good enough job.",
      "\"It's in no one's interest to have targets that are overly ambitious and basically impossible to achieve, or for companies who don't have the right governance in place to implement the actions that will be the building blocks of the actual strategy.\"",
      "One company that is happy with its SLL is Danish management consultancy Emagine. It borrowed \u00a310m in 2021, funds that helped it to acquire six other firms around the world.",
      "Its binding goals include increasing the number of female leaders in the organisation by 16%, and reducing overall employee turnover by 6% over the seven-year long period. It is doing this through leadership and mentoring programs.",
      "By meeting the targets, Emagine is benefiting from reduced interest rates, says Lars Bloch, the company's chief financial officer.",
      "\"If we didn't meet the goals, we would be landed with interest penalty rates. We also accept that failing to meet sustainability targets could harm the firm's reputation, as we have made a public commitment.",
      "\"It shouldn't be about committing to the loan to get a discount on financing - there needs to be ambition behind the goals.\"",

    "story": [
      "The climate action group Just Stop Oil has announced it is to disband at the end of April. Its activists have been derided as attention-seeking zealots and vandals and it is loathed by many for its disruptive direct action tactics. It says it has won because its demand that there should be no new oil and gas licences is now government policy.  So, did they really win and does this mark an end to the chaos caused by its climate protests?",
      "Hayley Walsh's heart was racing as she sat in the audience at the Theatre Royal Drury Lane on 27 January this year.",
      "The 42 year-old lecturer and mother of three tried to calm her breathing. Hollywood star Sigourney Weaver was onstage in her West End debut production of Shakespeare's The Tempest.",
      "But Hayley, a Just Stop Oil activist, had her own drama planned.",
      "As Weaver's Prospero declaimed \"Come forth, I say,\" Hayley sprang from her seat and rushed the stage with Richard Weir, a 60-year-old mechanical engineer from Tyneside.",
      "They launched a confetti cannon and unfurled a banner that read \"Over 1.5 Degrees is a Global Shipwreck\" - a reference to the news that 2024 was the first year to pass the symbolic 1.5C threshold in global average temperature rise, and a nod to the shipwreck theme in the play.",
      "It was a classic Just Stop Oil (JSO) action. The target was high profile and would guarantee publicity. The message was simple and presented in the group's signature fluorescent orange.",
      "The reaction of those affected was also a classic response to JSO.  Amid the boos and whistles you can hear a shout of \"idiots\".",
      "\"Drag them off the stage\", one audience member can be heard shouting, \"I hope you [expletive] get arrested,\" another says.",
      "JSO is a UK-based environmental activist group that aims to end fossil fuel extraction and uses direct action to draw attention to its cause. It has been called a \"criminal cult\" and its activists branded \"eco-loons\" by the Sun. The Daily Mail has described it as \"deranged\" and says its members have \"unleashed misery on thousands of ordinary people though their selfish antics\".",
      "The group has thrown soup at a Van Gogh in the National Gallery, exploded a chalk dust bomb during the World Snooker Championship in Sheffield, smashed a cabinet containing a copy of the Magna Carta at the British Library, sprayed temporary paint on the stones of Stonehenge and even defaced Charles Darwin's grave.",
      "But it is the group's road protests that have probably caused the most disruption \u2013 and public anger. In November 2022, 45 JSO members climbed gantries around the M25 severely disrupting traffic for over four days. People missed flights, medical appointments and exams as thousands of drivers were delayed for hours. The cost to the Metropolitan Police was put at \u00a31.1 million.",
      "Just Stop Oil was born out of Extinction Rebellion (XR).  XR \u2013 founded in 2018 - brought thousands of people onto the streets in what were dubbed \"festivals of resistance\".  They came to a peak in April 2019, when protestors brought parts of the capital to a halt for more than a week and plonked a large pink boat in the middle of Oxford Circus.",
      "The spectacle and disruption XR caused generated massive media attention, but the police were furious.  Hundreds of officers were diverted from frontline duties and by the end of 2019 the bill for policing the protests had reached \u00a337m.",
      "And behind the scenes XR was riven by furious debates about tactics.  Many inside the movement said it should be less confrontational and disruptive but a hard core of activists argued it would be more effective to double down on direct action.",
      "It became clear that there was room for what Sarah Lunnon, one of the co-founders of Just Stop Oil, calls \"a more radical flank\".  They decided a new, more focused operation was needed, modelled on earlier civil disobedience movements like the Suffragettes, Gandhi's civil disobedience campaigns and the civil rights movement in the US.",
      "The group was formally launched on Valentine's Day, 2022. It was a very different animal to XR. Instead of thousands of people taking part in street carnivals, JSO's actions involved a few committed activists. A small strategy group oversaw the campaign and meticulously planned its activities. A mobilisation team worked to recruit new members, and another team focused on supporting activists after they were arrested.",
      "The dozens of actions the group has carried out generated lots of publicity, but also massive public opposition. There were confrontations between members of the public and protestors and an outcry from politicians across all the main political parties.",
      "The police said they needed more powers to deal with this new form of protest and they got them. New offences were created including interfering with national infrastructure, \"locking on\" \u2013 chaining or gluing yourself to something \u2013 and tunnelling underground. Causing a public nuisance also became a potential crime \u2013 providing the police with a powerful new tool to use against protestors who block roads.",
      "In the four years since it was formed dozens of the group's supporters have been jailed. Five activists were handed multi-year sentences for their role in the M25 actions in 2022. Those were reduced on appeal earlier this month but are still the longest jail terms for non-violent civil disobedience ever issued.",
      "Senior JSO members deny the crackdown had anything to do with the group's decision to \"hang up the hi-vis\" \u2013 as its statement this week announcing the end of campaign put it.",
      "JSO's public position is that it has won its battle. \"Just Stop Oil's initial demand to end new oil and gas is now government policy, making us one of the most successful civil resistance campaigns in recent history,\" the group claimed.",
      "The government has said it does not plan to issue any new licences for oil and gas production but strongly denies its policies have a link to JSO. Furthermore, the Prime Minister's official spokesperson told journalists: \"We have been very clear when it comes to oil and gas that it has a future for decades to come in our energy mix.\"",
      "And the group's wider goal \u2013 to end the production of oil and gas \u2013 has manifestly not been achieved. The members of the group I spoke to for this article all agree the climate crisis has deepened.",
      "In the face of stiffer sentences, some climate campaigners have said they will turn to more clandestine activities. One new group says it plans a campaign of sabotage against key infrastructure. In a manifesto published online it says it plans to \"kickstart a new phase of the climate activist movement, aiming to shut down key actors of the fossil fuel economy.\"",
      "That's not a direction the JSO members I spoke to said they wanted to go. Sarah Lunnon said a key principle of JSO and the civil disobedience movement generally was that activists would take responsibility for their actions. One of the first questions new joiners were asked is whether they would be willing to be locked up.",
      "\"As corporations and billionaires corrupt political systems across the world, we need a different approach.",
      "\"We are creating a new strategy, to face this reality and to carry our responsibilities at this time,\" the group says, suggesting they may be planning to form a new movement.",
      "JSO's most high-profile figure, Roger Hallam, is one of the five activists convicted for their role in the M25 protests. In a message from his prison cell he acknowledged that JSO has only had a \"marginal impact\".",
      "That is \"not due to lack of trying,\" he said. The failure lay with the UK's \"elites and our leaders\" who had walked away from their responsibility to tackle the climate crisis, Hallam claimed. A hint perhaps that the group's new focus might be on the political system itself.",
      "JSO has said its last protest \u2013 to be held at the end of April \u2013 will mark \"the end of soup on Van Goghs, cornstarch on Stonehenge and slow marching in the streets\". But don't believe it. When pressed, the JSO members I spoke to said they may well turn back to disruptive tactics but under a new name and with a new and as yet unspecified objective.",

    "published": "Thu, 27 Mar 2025 12:13:45 GMT",
    "summary": "Sewage spilled into England's waterways for a record number of hours last year, the Environmental Agency says.",
    "story": [
      "Water companies released raw sewage into England's rivers and seas for a record 3.61 million hours last year, a slight increase on 2023.",
      "The data released by Environment Agency on Thursday showed that although the number of spills was down each spill lasted longer on average - resulting in a higher total number of hours.",
      "Some spilling can be legal, but concern has been mounting amongst scientists about the harm that regular sewage spilling is causing the country's aquatic life.",
      "Water UK, the industry body, said sewage spills are a \"disgrace\" but has committed to a programme of investment worth \u00a3104bn over the next five years.",
      "How much sewage is spilled near you?",
      "Water company makes case for higher bill increases",
      "\"These figures are disgraceful and are a stark reminder of how years of underinvestment have led to water companies discharging unacceptable levels of sewage into our rivers, lakes, and seas,\" said Environment Secretary Steve Reed.",
      "His views were echoed by Water UK Chief Executive David Henderson: \"Any sewage flowing into waterways is a disgrace. Unfortunately, it's a system fault that we have in our network which mixes rainwater and wastewater. Nobody wants to see any spill of sewage in our waterways.\"",
      "England, like much of the world, has a combined sewage system meaning that rainwater and sewage share the same pipes. In some instances, when there is too much rain, treatment works can be overwhelmed, and sewage is spilled via overflow points into the country's rivers, lakes and seas to prevent a back up to the system.",
      "This practice is legal. But previous investigations by the BBC and Environment Agency have revealed that sewage has also been spilled by water companies under dry conditions in breach of their permits.",
      "Water companies collectively oversee more than 15,000 of these overflow sites and this was the first year where all sites were monitored, revealing for the first time the extent of spilling.",
      "Sewage was spilt for 3.614 million hours in 2024 compared to 3.606 million hours in 2023.",
      "CEO of River Action, James Wallace, said: \"A year on from last year's catastrophic pollution figures, the true scale of the UK's water crisis is only now coming to light. The figures have barely budged, testament to the deepening sewage scandal.\"",
      "In 2022, Prof Chris Whitty, chief medical office for the UK, outlined the serious health risks sewage spills can pose for those using the country's waterways. Chief amongst them is bacteria from human faeces which he said can \"increase the risk of significant infections including antibiotic resistant bacteria\".",
      "Sewage also poses significant environmental risks \u2013 it increases nutrients in the water leading to algal blooms which then eventually denies other wildlife \u2013 like fish - oxygen. These spills also have been shown to introduce microplastics, drugs and sanitary products into rivers and seas.",
      "The River Ver in St Albans is one such location - the banks are littered with condoms, tampon applicators and wet wipes likely from sewage releases from nearby Markyate sewage treatment works owned by Thames Water. This rare chalk stream \u2013 one of around 200 worldwide \u2013 which supports important wildlife like water voles, saw more than 3,300 hours of spills in 2024.",
      "Of the spills a Thames Water spokesperson said: \"The Markyate area experienced one of the wettest years on record in 2024 which has caused excessive amounts of groundwater which has infiltrated into the network. This has resulted in the system being overwhelmed which has led to discharges into the river.\"",
      "Liberal Democrats Leader Ed Davey said the scale of spilling showed that the sector regulator, Ofwat, was not up to the task.",
      "\"This has to be the final nail in the coffin for Ofwat, a regulator that has time and again proven it is completely inadequate to protect customers and our beautiful environment,\" he said.",
      "In October, the government launched an Independent Water Commission, chaired by former deputy Bank of England governor Sir Jon Cunliffe, to look into the sector - including the effectiveness of Ofwat.",
      "An Ofwat spokesperson said: \"Where companies miss their targets, they will be penalised and money will be returned to customers. In parallel, companies will be held to account for past failures through our ongoing enforcement work into the operation and maintenance of sewage works and networks.\"",
      "The Markyate site is one of a number across the country that is due an upgrade as part of a five-year \u00a3104bn investment programme by water companies \u2013 with \u00a324bn going specifically to improving infrastructure.",
      "These upgrades will be paid largely through bill rises \u2013 which are due to take effect from 1 April \u2013 and will see the average annual bill hit \u00a3603. This has angered consumer groups and environmental charities who argue that the burden of upgrades should be carried by shareholders not households.",
      "Prof Ewan McGaughey, Professor of Law at Kings College London, said: \"The water companies have paid over \u00a385bn out to shareholders since privatisation and that means they haven't been able to put the money into infrastructure.\"",
      "Ofwat and the industry have previously denied the figure\u2013 which comes from University of Greenwich research \u2013 is as high, but there is agreement that significant investment is required.",
      "Phillip Clisham, specialist adviser to the Institution of Civil Engineers on water and sanitation, has worked in the industry for more than three decades, and said the challenge of fixing the issue has been \"underestimated\".",
      "He said the two main solutions are building bigger storm tanks \u2013 which produce a huge amount of planet warming emissions in their construction \u2013 or to reduce excess rainwater by increasing green areas and the use of sustainable urban drainage systems.",
      "What are sustainable urban drainage systems?",
      "What are sustainable urban drainage systems?",
      "It is this second solution that is preferable for the environment, he said, but it requires coordination between government, planning officers and housing developers \u2013 and takes longer to implement.",

      "News broke of the difficulties facing the canal in a letter sent to local businesses by Gland\u0175r Cymru, the Canal and River Trust in Wales, in February.",
      "It explained the canal, which once transported iron and coal to Newport docks, had relied on funnelling water from the River Usk and its tributaries which accounted for 80-90% of its water supply.",
      "Recent changes in legislation, designed in part to protect rivers in the face of climate change, means licences are now required, restricting the amount of water that can be taken.",
      "Last year, Gland\u0175r Cymru lost an appeal against some of the conditions stipulated by environmental regulator Natural Resources Wales (NRW).",
      "The River Usk is a designated special area of conservation protected by law due to its importance for rare wildlife including the Atlantic salmon, which is threatened with extinction from Wales.",

      "Alasdair Kirkpatrick, owner of Beacon Park Boats, said he had already received phone calls from customers who had booked boat trips asking about the impact on them.",
      "\"I never saw this one coming,\" he said, \"it has really shocked us all.\"",
      "\"All my customers nip down to the local pubs and restaurants, 25% of them fly in from overseas from places like America and Australia, using local taxis and train services and spending a fortune locally,\" he added.",
      "He urged the Welsh government \"to fund Welsh Water to continue to maintain water levels and keep all the operators of this canal in business - it cannot be lost\".",
      "Gavin Bown from Natural Resources Wales said regulating water abstraction was \"a complex, evidence-based process that carefully balances environmental needs with those of local communities\".",

    "summary": "Gothenburg has to pay a financial penalty if it misses certain annual sustainability goals.",
    "story": [
      "Gothenburg, Sweden's second city, is highlighting its environmental credentials by continuing to put its money on the line.",
      "Back in 2022, the City of Gothenburg, became what is believed to be the first local government in the world to take out a \"sustainability linked loan\" or SLL.",
      "This is a form of financing pegged to a set of annual environmental and social improvements agreed between a borrower and its banks.",
      "Gothenburg's four target areas are efforts to make renewable energy the sole source of the city's heat production, making the council's own vehicle fleet electric, reducing energy usage in municipality-owned buildings, such as hospitals and schools, and improving the city's poorest neighbourhoods.",
      "Meet agreed annual improvement levels in these sectors and, for each, Gothenburg gets a discount on the yearly fee it pays for the loan of 0.1% or around 100,000 kronor ($10,500; \u00a38,000). But miss one of the targets by a certain amount and it has to pay a fine of the same amount.",
      "In 2022 and 2023 Gothenburg managed to avoid a financial penalty, but the newly released figures for 2024 show that it missed its target for switching to renewable energy. And so it is about to be fined 150,000 kroner.",
      "However, this is offset by the discounts it is getting for continuing to hit improvement levels for energy usage and social improvement. For electrifying the council's vehicles, while it missed its improvement goal, it didn't do so by enough to be fined.",
      "Fredrik Block, portfolio manager at the City of Gothenburg, says that the local authority deliberately set \"ambitious\" targets.",
      "\"You aim high, and you get the whole organisation to strive towards that target. We are not proceeding as fast as we expected, but we are taking one step at a time. The goal is still to be close to carbon-free by 2030.",
      "\"We're actually not doing it for the money. We're doing it to show the city's important work and that we are making progress every year. We want to show to the world how it is - that these are the problems, and these are the good things.\"",
      "The improvements to the city's poorest areas \u2013 and whether the council has hit its targets - are measured by yearly resident surveys. People are asked about their feelings towards an area's safety and cleanliness.",
      "Key initiatives have included making housing more secure, introducing more surveillance cameras and increasing police presence as a crime prevention measure in areas of the city like Hjallbo and Biskopsgarden. Located in the north of the city, they have high levels of crime and unemployment, and large immigrant populations.",
      "Public housing agency Framtiden, which is ultimately owned by the City of Gothenburg, says it takes the improvement work very seriously.",
      "\"For some of these vulnerable areas, we actually own the majority of the housing,\" says its research and development manager, Lars Bankvall.",
      "\"We are more or less the only official body in these areas. There's no one else there, only us.",
      "\"I see us as maybe the most powerful tool that the city has, because we have a lot of financial resources. We are involved in everything.\"",
      "But Faduma Awil, a social worker who now provides career coaching at an employment centre in Gothenburg, is concerned that increased cameras and police presence sends the wrong message to youth in Gothenburg's deprived areas - and could see racial profiling increase.",
      "\"What will our children think when they see cameras everywhere in Hjallbo, but none in a Swedish neighbourhood? How will they feel when they are constantly being watched by police?\" she says.",
      "\"What will you tell them? You are showing them there is a difference between them and native Swedes.\"",
      "Ms Awil is also not convinced the resident surveys are effective or accurate. And she feels the city is placing a disproportionate amount of effort into its environmental goals, at the expense of improving conditions in underprivileged areas.",
      "\"People in these areas don't care about the environment. They need to go to school. They need to work. They need to eat,\" says Ms Awil, who migrated from Somalia to Sweden in 1987 as a child.",
      "Negotiating an SLL is a rigorous, complex process - one that took the City of Gothenburg a year to do, with no fewer than six major Nordic banks involved.",
      "Such is the difficulty of acquiring an SLL that the number issued globally fell by 56% in 2023, according to data from financial news provider Bloomberg.",
      "Mats Olausson is senior sustainability advisor at Swedish bank SEB, which is the lead lender of Gothenburg's SLL.",
      "He says SEB has turned down potential SLL borrowers as the client's proposed targets weren't ambitious enough. Yet he adds that SLLs are challenging for companies or local authorities that successfully get one.",
      "\"It's sad if a company puts a lot of resources into designing an SLL, and then it turns out that the only publicity they get is negative,\" he says. \"You run the risk of being pulled into the dirt for having not done a good enough job.",
      "\"It's in no one's interest to have targets that are overly ambitious and basically impossible to achieve, or for companies who don't have the right governance in place to implement the actions that will be the building blocks of the actual strategy.\"",
      "One company that is happy with its SLL is Danish management consultancy Emagine. It borrowed \u00a310m in 2021, funds that helped it to acquire six other firms around the world.",
      "Its binding goals include increasing the number of female leaders in the organisation by 16%, and reducing overall employee turnover by 6% over the seven-year long period. It is doing this through leadership and mentoring programs.",
      "By meeting the targets, Emagine is benefiting from reduced interest rates, says Lars Bloch, the company's chief financial officer.",
      "\"If we didn't meet the goals, we would be landed with interest penalty rates. We also accept that failing to meet sustainability targets could harm the firm's reputation, as we have made a public commitment.",
      "\"It shouldn't be about committing to the loan to get a discount on financing - there needs to be ambition behind the goals.\"",
      "Back in Gothenburg, the city's current environmental and social targets run until 2030. Mr Block says that the detailed yearly SLL reporting shows to potential future investors in the city what a difference their money would make.",
      "\"Banks want to give money to sustainable cities, so packaging up our progress in our SLL reporting is how I make the city beautiful for investors,\" he says.",
      "\"I can't change the credit worthiness of the city, but I can change how investors look at our sustainability work, and make it more attractive to them.\"",

    "summary": "Just Stop Oil says it will disband but does this mark an end to the chaos caused by its climate protests?",
    "story": [
      "The climate action group Just Stop Oil has announced it is to disband at the end of April. Its activists have been derided as attention-seeking zealots and vandals and it is loathed by many for its disruptive direct action tactics. It says it has won because its demand that there should be no new oil and gas licences is now government policy.  So, did they really win and does this mark an end to the chaos caused by its climate protests?",
      "Hayley Walsh's heart was racing as she sat in the audience at the Theatre Royal Drury Lane on 27 January this year.",
      "The 42 year-old lecturer and mother of three tried to calm her breathing. Hollywood star Sigourney Weaver was onstage in her West End debut production of Shakespeare's The Tempest.",
      "But Hayley, a Just Stop Oil activist, had her own drama planned.",
      "As Weaver's Prospero declaimed \"Come forth, I say,\" Hayley sprang from her seat and rushed the stage with Richard Weir, a 60-year-old mechanical engineer from Tyneside.",
      "They launched a confetti cannon and unfurled a banner that read \"Over 1.5 Degrees is a Global Shipwreck\" - a reference to the news that 2024 was the first year to pass the symbolic 1.5C threshold in global average temperature rise, and a nod to the shipwreck theme in the play.",
      "It was a classic Just Stop Oil (JSO) action. The target was high profile and would guarantee publicity. The message was simple and presented in the group's signature fluorescent orange.",
      "The reaction of those affected was also a classic response to JSO.  Amid the boos and whistles you can hear a shout of \"idiots\".",
      "\"Drag them off the stage\", one audience member can be heard shouting, \"I hope you [expletive] get arrested,\" another says.",
      "JSO is a UK-based environmental activist group that aims to end fossil fuel extraction and uses direct action to draw attention to its cause. It has been called a \"criminal cult\" and its activists branded \"eco-loons\" by the Sun. The Daily Mail has described it as \"deranged\" and says its members have \"unleashed misery on thousands of ordinary people though their selfish antics\".",
      "The group has thrown soup at a Van Gogh in the National Gallery, exploded a chalk dust bomb during the World Snooker Championship in Sheffield, smashed a cabinet containing a copy of the Magna Carta at the British Library, sprayed temporary paint on the stones of Stonehenge and even defaced Charles Darwin's grave.",
      "But it is the group's road protests that have probably caused the most disruption \u2013 and public anger. In November 2022, 45 JSO members climbed gantries around the M25 severely disrupting traffic for over four days. People missed flights, medical appointments and exams as thousands of drivers were delayed for hours. The cost to the Metropolitan Police was put at \u00a31.1 million.",
      "Just Stop Oil was born out of Extinction Rebellion (XR).  XR \u2013 founded in 2018 - brought thousands of people onto the streets in what were dubbed \"festivals of resistance\".  They came to a peak in April 2019, when protestors brought parts of the capital to a halt for more than a week and plonked a large pink boat in the middle of Oxford Circus.",
      "The spectacle and disruption XR caused generated massive media attention, but the police were furious.  Hundreds of officers were diverted from frontline duties and by the end of 2019 the bill for policing the protests had reached \u00a337m.",
      "And behind the scenes XR was riven by furious debates about tactics.  Many inside the movement said it should be less confrontational and disruptive but a hard core of activists argued it would be more effective to double down on direct action.",
      "It became clear that there was room for what Sarah Lunnon, one of the co-founders of Just Stop Oil, calls \"a more radical flank\".  They decided a new, more focused operation was needed, modelled on earlier civil disobedience movements like the Suffragettes, Gandhi's civil disobedience campaigns and the civil rights movement in the US.",
      "The group was formally launched on Valentine's Day, 2022. It was a very different animal to XR. Instead of thousands of people taking part in street carnivals, JSO's actions involved a few committed activists. A small strategy group oversaw the campaign and meticulously planned its activities. A mobilisation team worked to recruit new members, and another team focused on supporting activists after they were arrested.",
      "The dozens of actions the group has carried out generated lots of publicity, but also massive public opposition. There were confrontations between members of the public and protestors and an outcry from politicians across all the main political parties.",
      "The police said they needed more powers to deal with this new form of protest and they got them. New offences were created including interfering with national infrastructure, \"locking on\" \u2013 chaining or gluing yourself to something \u2013 and tunnelling underground. Causing a public nuisance also became a potential crime \u2013 providing the police with a powerful new tool to use against protestors who block roads.",
      "In the four years since it was formed dozens of the group's supporters have been jailed. Five activists were handed multi-year sentences for their role in the M25 actions in 2022. Those were reduced on appeal earlier this month but are still the longest jail terms for non-violent civil disobedience ever issued.",
      "Senior JSO members deny the crackdown had anything to do with the group's decision to \"hang up the hi-vis\" \u2013 as its statement this week announcing the end of campaign put it.",
      "JSO's public position is that it has won its battle. \"Just Stop Oil's initial demand to end new oil and gas is now government policy, making us one of the most successful civil resistance campaigns in recent history,\" the group claimed.",
      "The government has said it does not plan to issue any new licences for oil and gas production but strongly denies its policies have a link to JSO. Furthermore, the Prime Minister's official spokesperson told journalists: \"We have been very clear when it comes to oil and gas that it has a future for decades to come in our energy mix.\"",
      "And the group's wider goal \u2013 to end the production of oil and gas \u2013 has manifestly not been achieved. The members of the group I spoke to for this article all agree the climate crisis has deepened.",
      "In the face of stiffer sentences, some climate campaigners have said they will turn to more clandestine activities. One new group says it plans a campaign of sabotage against key infrastructure. In a manifesto published online it says it plans to \"kickstart a new phase of the climate activist movement, aiming to shut down key actors of the fossil fuel economy.\"",
      "That's not a direction the JSO members I spoke to said they wanted to go. Sarah Lunnon said a key principle of JSO and the civil disobedience movement generally was that activists would take responsibility for their actions. One of the first questions new joiners were asked is whether they would be willing to be locked up.",
      "\"As corporations and billionaires corrupt political systems across the world, we need a different approach.",
      "\"We are creating a new strategy, to face this reality and to carry our responsibilities at this time,\" the group says, suggesting they may be planning to form a new movement.",
      "JSO's most high-profile figure, Roger Hallam, is one of the five activists convicted for their role in the M25 protests. In a message from his prison cell he acknowledged that JSO has only had a \"marginal impact\".",
      "That is \"not due to lack of trying,\" he said. The failure lay with the UK's \"elites and our leaders\" who had walked away from their responsibility to tackle the climate crisis, Hallam claimed. A hint perhaps that the group's new focus might be on the political system itself.",
      "JSO has said its last protest \u2013 to be held at the end of April \u2013 will mark \"the end of soup on Van Goghs, cornstarch on Stonehenge and slow marching in the streets\". But don't believe it. When pressed, the JSO members I spoke to said they may well turn back to disruptive tactics but under a new name and with a new and as yet unspecified objective.",

      "President Donald Trump has said a deal to sell TikTok will be made by 5 April, as questions swirl over whether the app will be banned in the United States.",
      "The platform 'went dark' for US users in January as a law took effect which banned the app unless it was sold by its parent company ByteDance.",
      "But TikTok returned less than a day later following Trump's election win, and he signed an executive order delaying its sale or ban by 75 days.",
      "Tech companies, celebrities and investors have since lined up to buy the app.",
      "Has Trump overturned the US TikTok ban?",
      "An executive order is an instruction from the president which has the weight of the law behind it.",
      "Trump signed such an order regarding TikTok's sale or ban on 21 January, shortly after his inauguration.",
      "But the president's order does not overturn the ban.",
      "Instead it tells the US attorney general not to enforce the law for now - something experts had expected would be his first move.",
      "That buys time for his administration to, as the order puts it, \"determine the appropriate course of action\".",
      "It allows the president to directly oppose a ruling by the Supreme Court upholding the law to ban TikTok on 17 January.",
      "The Supreme Court's ruling said the ban was \"designed to prevent China - a designated foreign adversary - from leveraging its control over ByteDance to capture the personal data of US TikTok users\".",
      "Could TikTok be banned again in the US?",
      "Trump's extended deadline for TikTok's sale or ban gives ByteDance until 5 April to find a buyer.",
      "If no deal is reached the app could once again face a US ban and be pulled from mobile app stores.",
      "However, Trump could allow the law to stand but tell the Department of Justice (DoJ) to continue to ignore it.",
      "The government would be effectively telling Apple and Google they will not be punished for allowing people to download TikTok onto their devices - meaning the law would remain in place but would essentially be redundant.",
      "TikTok returned to Google's Play Store and Apple's App Store in February, after the companies were reportedly told they would not face consequences for hosting it.",
      "Trump has also said he would \"probably\" extend the deadline, if needed.",
      "Could TikTok ever be banned in the UK too?",
      "Who might buy TikTok?",
      "ByteDance has long insisted that TikTok is not for sale, and whether that has changed under Trump's presidency remains unclear.",
      "The president told reporters on 30 March there were \"a lot of potential buyers\" and \"tremendous interest\" in buying the app.",
      "He said earlier in March his administration was talking to four different groups about a potential sale.",
      "Trump appears to want to find a compromise that complies with the spirit rather than the letter of law.",
      "He has also floated the idea of TikTok being jointly owned - telling reporters he was seeking a 50-50 partnership between \"the United States\" and ByteDance.",
      "Meanwhile, several names have been floated as potential buyers of the company.",
      "Trump said he would be open to selling TikTok to Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison, as well as Elon Musk.",
      "Previous names linked with buying TikTok include billionaire Frank McCourt and the Canadian businessman Kevin O'Leary - a celebrity investor on Shark Tank, the US version of Dragon's Den.",
      "Alexis Ohanian, who co-founded Reddit, said in a post on X in March he had joined Mr McCourt's bid.",
      "\"The list of people who do not want to buy TikTok is much smaller than the list who do,\" Mr Musk replied.",
      "The biggest YouTuber in the world Jimmy Donaldson - AKA MrBeast - has also claimed he is in the running after a number of investors contacted him following an earlier tweet signalling his interest.",
      "Companies including Microsoft are even among those involved in discussions to buy TikTok, according to Trump.",
      "A US search engine called Perplexity AI has also reportedly offered to merge with TikTok.",
      "What other platforms could TikTok users use instead?",
      "TikTok says it has 170 million US users who spent - on average - 51 minutes per day on the app in 2024.",
      "Experts say rivals such as Instagram Reels and YouTube Shorts could benefit if Trump's efforts to fully restore TikTok don't succeed.",
      "Users bring advertisers - so this could be a big financial boost to those platforms.",
      "\"Chief marketing officers who we've spoken with confirmed that they will divert their media dollars to Meta and Google if they can no longer advertise on TikTok,\" said Kelsey Chickering, an analyst at market research company Forrester.",
      "Other potential winners include Twitch, which made its name by hosting livestreams - a popular feature on TikTok. Twitch is well known particularly to gamers, though its other content is expanding too.",
      "Other Chinese-owned platforms, such as Xiaohongshu - known as RedNote among its US users - have also seen rapid growth in the US and the UK."

    "story": [
      "Wikipedia is one of the most visited websites in the world but, by the admission of some of its own volunteer editors, it suffers from a persistent problem - terrible pictures, particularly of celebrities.",
      "It is so full of notable people with very old or unflattering photographs that there are even Instagram accounts dedicated to the very worst ones.",
      "The problem arises because professional photographers who attend, for example, film premieres tend to work for big agencies: their work is copyrighted and you usually need to pay to reproduce it.",
      "Wikipedia - which is largely sustained by volunteers - does not have a budget for that.",
      "Some enthusiasts launched WikiPortraits, a project to recruit a group of volunteer photographers around the world and get them accreditation to attend film festivals, conferences and other events.",
      "\"Wikipedia has for the longest time had missing or poor quality photos of people,\" said Kevin Payravi, one of the project's founders.",
      "\"This issue has always been in the back of our minds as Wikipedia editors.\"",

      "Wikipedia has strict rules for photography and copyright, so the pictures uploaded must be a contributor's own, freely licensed or in the public domain.",
      "As a result it contains many images added by enthusiasts rather than taken by photographers.",
      "In some cases that merely means a non-descript image - but sometimes they are much worse than that.",
      "A prime example: the comedian Emil Wakim, of Saturday Night Live fame.",
      "For a week last November, the photo above - apparently taken at a stand-up show in New York - was his Wikipedia picture.",
      "When it was removed, an editor noted \"having no picture is better than what's currently there\".",
      "The photo of the English footballer Kyle Bartley, taken in 2011, has also been highlighted by social media users as evidence of Wikipedia's picture problem.",
      "The project so far",
      "WikiPortraits started its work at the beginning of 2024.",
      "The photographers are not paid and most are based in the US, but there are volunteers across the world.",
      "Jennifer and Kevin say their photographers tend to be Wikipedia enthusiasts, photography hobbyists, and professionals keen to build their portfolios.",
      "So far, 55 of them have done work for WikiPortraits, or are committed to doing so.",
      "Bryan Berlin is one of the photographers. A high school photography teacher and stand-up comedian from New York, he first got involved with WikiPortraits while he was performing at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe.",
      "He has attended the New York Film Festival and Sundance, and took pictures of Kieran Culkin and Mikey Madison.",
      "He says he is motivated by improving the service Wikipedia offers.",
      "\"Having a better photo of someone gives better information for somebody who is accessing Wikipedia,\" he told the BBC.",
      "He might not be paid but Bryan feels there is something in it for him too, saying working on the red carpet has made him a better photographer.",
      "One of his favourite experiences with a celebrity was with Lord of the Rings star Elijah Wood.",
      "\"He was just such a kind person, and said it was so cool that we were doing this.\"",
      "The Edinburgh festival, Cannes and the Nobel prizes are some of the events covered so far, and the project says its photographs are viewed around 100 million times a month.",
      "Some of the biggest names in entertainment now have a WikiPortraits image as their Wikipedia picture.",
      "While those pictures attract attention, the project is also proud to have taken photos of people, such as under-represented filmmakers, who had no Wikipedia picture at all.",
      "Frank Sun is a filmmaker and cinematography who does photography as a hobby. His work on WikiPortraits includes pictures of Florence Pugh and Ben Stiller.",
      "Also based in New York, he has taken pictures at Cannes, Sundance, and the Toronto film festivals.",
      "He fondly remembers an experience with Laetitia Dosch, the French actress, writer and director.",

      "Maybe Marine Le Pen was naive in not predicting this outcome. It certainly appears as if her National Rally party was singularly unprepared for it.",

      "Do they continue as if there is still a chance Marine Le Pen will run in 2027?",
      "In theory there is still a (small) possibility.  She has launched an appeal. The appeal could be accelerated and take place at the end of this year or early 2026. A verdict would follow in the spring.",
      "A different decision at the appeal hearing could lessen the period of ineligibility, or remove it altogether \u2013 in which case she could still run.  But the chances must be regarded as slim.",

      "What, for example, will the effect of the court decision be on the RN vote?",
      "In the short term we can expect an outcry, and a boost to the party's support.  Why? Because what has happened fits so neatly into the RN narrative that the populist right is a victim of the \"system\".",
      "No-one likely to vote for the RN seriously holds it against Marine Le Pen for illegally financing her party using EU parliament funds.  They all know that practically every French political party has resorted to similar underhand methods in the past.",
      "By the same token,  her \"draconian\" punishment \u2013 being banned from standing for the presidency \u2013 will be interpreted as a badge of honour: proof that she alone is standing up to the powers-that-be.",
      "Longer term, though, the boost may not be so powerful.  The truth is that Marine Le Pen is a huge asset to the RN.  This battle-hardened, sentimental, cat-loving,  tough-talking,  long-suffering woman is held in affection by her supporters, who feel they know her personally.",

      "Five ambulances, a fire truck and a UN vehicle were struck \"one by one\" in the al-Hashashin area on 23 March, according to a UN official. The 15 bodies were recovered from a \"mass grave\" on Sunday, he said.",
      "The Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS) said a ninth medic was missing and accused Israel of targeting staff.",
      "Israel's military said troops fired on vehicles \"advancing suspiciously\" without headlights or emergency signals. It said a Hamas operative and \"eight other terrorists\" were among those killed.",
      "The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) said in a statement on Sunday that the eight bodies of PRCS medics were retrieved \"after seven days of silence and having access denied to the area of Rafah where they were last seen\".",
      "The organisation identified those killed as ambulance officers Mostafa Khufaga, Saleh Muamer and Ezzedine Shaath, and first responder volunteers Mohammad Bahloul, Mohammed al-Heila, Ashraf Abu Labda, Raed al-Sharif and Rifatt Radwan.",
      "It added that ambulance officer Assad al-Nassasra was \"still missing\".",
      "\"I am heartbroken. These dedicated ambulance workers were responding to wounded people. They were humanitarians,\" IFRC Secretary General Jagan Chapagain said.",

      "\"Even in the most complex conflict zones, there are rules. These rules of International Humanitarian Law could not be clearer \u2013 civilians must be protected; humanitarians must be protected. Health services must be protected.\"",
      "The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) said in a separate statement that it was \"appalled\" that the medics were killed while carrying out their work.",
      "The head of the UN Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) in Gaza, Jonathan Whittall, said in a post on X on Sunday that its staff had supported the PRCS and Civil Defence in recovering the 15 bodies of the PRCS medics, Civil Defence first responders and UN staff member from \"a mass grave... that was marked with the emergency light from one of their crushed ambulances\".",
      "In a video that was posted online on Monday, Mr Whittall said: \"Seven days ago, Civil Defence and PRCS ambulances arrived at the scene. One by one they were hit, they were struck. Their bodies were gathered and buried in this mass grave. We're digging them out with uniforms, with their gloves on. They were here to save lives. Instead, they ended up in a mass grave.\"",
      "\"Their vehicles... are crushed and dumped, covered in sand next to us. It's an absolute horror what has happened here. This should never happen. Healthcare workers should never be a target.\"",
      "The head of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (Unrwa), Philippe Lazzarini, said the UN staff member was one of its employees and that the burial of the bodies in \"shallow graves\" was \"a profound violation of human dignity\".",
      "The PRCS said it was devastated by the \"massacre of our team\".",
      "\"[Israel's] targeting of Red Crescent medics, despite the protected status of their mission and the Red Crescent emblem can only be considered a war crime punishable under international humanitarian law,\" a statement added.",
      "At the funeral for the medics on Monday, the father of Ashraf Abu Labda told the BBC: \"They [Israeli troops] targeted the first vehicle, then the second and then the third. They killed them in cold blood.\"",
      "\"We've been trying to look for them for eight days. They refused all co-ordination with Red Crescent, OCHA, or the UN. No-one can hold them accountable. Only God,\" Nasser Abu Labda said.",
      "The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said in a statement that during an operation in southern Gaza on 23 March \"several vehicles were identified advancing suspiciously toward IDF troops without headlights, or emergency signals, their movement was not co-ordinated in advance. Thus, IDF troops opened fire at the suspected vehicles.\"",
      "\"Following an initial assessment, it was determined that the forces had eliminated a Hamas military operative, Mohammad Amin Ibrahim Shubaki, along with eight other terrorists from Hamas and the PIJ [Palestinian Islamic Jihad],\" it added.",
      "\"Following the strike, the IDF co-ordinated with international organisations to facilitate the evacuation of the bodies.\"",
      "A previous IDF statement about the incident said an initial inquiry had determined that \"some of the suspicious vehicles that were moving towards the troops were ambulances and fire trucks\". It also condemned what it called the \"repeated use of civilian infrastructure by terrorist organisations\".",
      "The IDF has not commented on the whereabouts of the missing PRCS medic. The OCHA said it was not clear if he was dead, had been detained or something else had happened.",
      "Senior Hamas official Basem Naim condemned the attack.",
      "\"The targeted killing of rescue workers - who are protected under international humanitarian law - constitutes a flagrant violation of the Geneva Conventions and a war crime,\" he said.",
      "OCHA spokeswoman Olga Cherevko said there needed to be a full investigation to establish exactly what happened.",
      "\"They were aid workers in clearly marked vehicles, so this is why it's obviously important to get to the bottom of it and get all the facts,\" she told the BBC.",
      "When asked about the IDF statements that Hamas and PIJ members had been killed, she said: \"There are certain rules that all wars have, and this is why all parties to the conflict have to, obviously, abide by these rules. And this is what we've always said... But that doesn't negate the fact that humanitarian aid workers and emergency responders shouldn't be targeted.\"",
      "The incident in al-Hashashin happened on the same day that the IDF announced that its troops had encircled the nearby Tel al-Sultan area of Rafah and raided what it said was a Hamas command-and-control centre there.",
      "On Monday, the IDF issued a sweeping new evacuation order for the entire Rafah region, telling all residents to head towards the nearby al-Mawasi humanitarian zone for their safety.",

    "summary": "The South Korean star says he did not date his fellow actor when she was a minor.",
    "story": [
      "South Korean star Kim Soo-hyun has made a tearful public statement denying allegations made by the family of actress Kim Sae-ron,  who died in an apparent suicide in February.",
      "\"I can't admit to something I didn't do,\" the 37-year-old said on Monday at a press conference in Seoul.",
      "At the centre of the controversy are two allegations: that Kim Soo-hyun dated Kim Sae-ron when she was 15 - a minor - and that his agency pressured her to repay a loan she owed him.",
      "The scandal has shocked South Korea and its entertainment industry - and has generated a backlash against Kim Soo-Hyun, whose roles in multiple hit drama series and films has made him one of its best-known stars.",
      "Kim wept as he said that although he dated the actress for a year when she was an adult, they never dated while she was underage.",
      "Monday's media conference came after weeks of accusations and counter-accusations between Kim Sae-ron's family and Kim Soo-hyun's camp in the wake of her death.",
      "The scandal broke on 10 March, less than a month after Kim Sae-ron's death. A YouTube channel, known for its controversial political content, claimed that the two had dated for six years, when she was 15. The channel has since released videos and photos it claims were taken during their relationship.",
      "Last week, the attorney representing Kim Sae-ron's family held a press conference, revealing more chat history allegedly between the two actors from 2016, when she was 16.",
      "Kim Soo-hyun's agency initially denied the allegations but later clarified that they dated, though only between 2019 and 2020, when she was an adult.",
      "The actor himself had remained silent until Monday. At the press conference, he became emotional, reiterating to reporters that they only dated as two adults.",
      "\"Many people are suffering because of me,\" he said, apologising to his fans and staff. \"I also feel sorry that the late actress [Kim Sae-ron] isn't able to rest in peace.",
      "\"I never dated her when she was a minor,\" he continued. \"Except for the fact that both of us were actors, our relationship was just like that of any other ordinary couple.\"",
      "He also explained why he denied the relationship when she uploaded a later-deleted photo of the two of them to her Instagram account in 2024 during the airing of Netflix hit show Queen of Tears, in which he played the lead role.",
      "\"I had so much to protect as its lead actor. What would have happened if I had admitted to a year-long relationship? What would happen to the actors, the staff who were working overnight and the production team who had everything staked on that project?\" he said. \"The more I thought of it, the more I thought that shouldn't be what I do.\"",
      "Any admission of a romantic relationship or a partner is still seen as scandalous to fans in South Korea's entertainment industry, where celebrities' personal lives come under intense scrutiny.",
      "Kim Sae-ron herself was a victim of online hate by fans after she was fined 20 million won (\u00a311,000; $14,000) for a 2022 drink-driving incident.",
      "Prior to that, she had been seen as one of the most promising young actresses in South Korea.",
      "At the time, she was managed by the same agency as Kim Soo-hyun, which was co-founded by his relative. Kim Sae-ron joined GoldMedalist in January 2020 and left in December 2022.",
      "Kim Sae-ron's family claimed that GoldMedalist covered the compensation for her drunk-driving incident. They allege that the agency later pursued legal action for repayment and that, while the actress asked Kim Soo-hyun for more time to settle the debt, her request went unanswered.",
      "On Monday, Kim Soo-hyun denied claims that \"she made the tragic choice because of me or my agency pressuring her over a debt\".",
      "He released a voice recording of a phone call from a year ago, allegedly between his agency and Kim Sae-ron's representative.",
      "In the recording, the CEO of GoldMedalist appears to explain that the document they sent her regarding the debt was merely for \"procedural reasons\" and that her team could take time to respond.",
      "He also accused Kim Sae-ron's family of manipulating chat records as evidence and stated that he had submitted his own evidence to the relevant authorities for verification. He urged her family to do the same.",
      "Kim Soo-hyun, 37, is an A-list actor in South Korea, known for his roles in multiple hit drama series and top-grossing movies, including My Love from the Star, Netflix's Queen of Tears, and the film Secretly, Greatly.",
      "He has also been a favourite among advertisers in the country, though many brands have now distanced themselves from him amid the controversy. On 17 March, fashion brand Prada announced that it had mutually decided to end its collaboration with him, according to Reuters. This followed similar moves from Dinto, a Korean cosmetic brand.",
      "A Disney+ show that stars Kim Soo-hyun has also been put on pause due to the scandal, according to local news outlet Yonhap.",
      "His lawyer stated on Monday that they had filed a criminal complaint against Kim Sae-ron's family and the YouTube channel operator, along with a civil lawsuit for damages worth 12 billion won.",
      "Her family has not commented on the lawsuits or his latest remarks.",

    "story": [
      "Billionaire Elon Musk has given away $1m (\u00a3770,000) cheques to voters in Wisconsin after the state supreme court refused to intervene.",
      "Musk announced the prize earlier this week, ahead of Wisconsin's tightly contested Supreme Court election to be held on Tuesday.",
      "Wisconsin Attorney General and Democrat Josh Kaul had sued to stop the giveaway, arguing that Musk was violating a state law that bans gifts in exchange for votes.",
      "The race, which could flip control of the state's supreme court to the Republicans, has become a flash point and the most expensive judicial election in American history.",
      "Speaking at a rally Sunday night, Musk said \"we just want judges to be judges\", before handing out two $1m (\u00a3750,000) cheques to voters who had signed a petition to stop \"activist\" judges.",
      "Kaul had tried to argue the giveaway was an illegal attempt buy votes. Musk's lawyers, in response, argued that Kaul is \"restraining Mr Musk's political speech and curtailing his First Amendment rights\".",
      "Musk's lawyers added that the payments were \"intended to generate a grassroots movement in opposition to activist judges, not to expressly advocate for or against any candidate\".",
      "After two lower courts sided with Musk, Kaul begged the state's supreme court for an 11th hour reprieve. But the top court unanimously declined to hear the case.",
      "Musk and President Donald Trump have endorsed a conservative candidate, Waukesha County Judge Brad Schimel, in hopes of flipping the liberal-leaning court.",
      "Judge Schimel is running against Dane County Judge Susan Crawford, who has been endorsed by the state Supreme Court's liberal justices.",
      "Lawyers for the tech titan also argued that judges who have publicly endorsed Judge Crawford in the Supreme Court race should be barred from ruling on the matter, arguing that it is a matter of bias.",
      "Wisconsin's Supreme Court race is being seen by political watchers as a referendum on Trump's second term, just months after his inauguration.",
      "It also comes ahead of consequential cases that will land before the court on abortion rights, congressional redistricting and voting rules that could affect the 2026 midterm elections.",
      "Musk himself has framed the election as a chance to stop redistricting which could give Democrats favour in Congress.",
      "He has donated $14m to Judge Schimel's campaign, as the race proves to be the most expensive judicial race in the country's history, with $81m in total spending.",
      "Despite his support, Judge Schimel appeared to distance himself from Musk in recent days, telling the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel on Friday he had no plans to be at the rally.",
      "\"I have no idea what he's doing. I have no idea what this rally is,\" Judge Schimel told the newspaper.",
      "This is not the first time Musk has announced a giveaway to voters. Last year, he similarly offered a cash prize of $1m a day to voters in Wisconsin and six other battleground states if they signed a petition supporting First and Second Amendment rights.",
      "A judge in Pennsylvania later ruled that the giveaway was legal, saying prosecutors failed to prove it was an unlawful lottery."

      "An American surgeon who's been working in two Gaza hospitals for the past three weeks has said that wounded Palestinian patients have died because of the lack of equipment and supplies.",
      "Dr Mark Perlmutter says that doctors have had to work in operating rooms without soap, antibiotics or x-ray facilities, as Israel has resumed its offensive against Hamas in Gaza.",
      "A 15-year-old girl who was hit by Israeli machine gun fire while riding her bicycle was one of the many wounded children that Dr Perlmutter said he had to operate on.",
      "The Israeli government has said the renewed attacks that its military is carrying out in Gaza are aimed at forcing Hamas to release all the remaining hostages.",
      "Dr Perlmutter spoke to the BBC shortly after the end of his second trip to Gaza - the first one was around a year ago. Critical of Israel's conduct in the Strip, he has previously called for an arms embargo and said its attacks on Gaza constitute genocide, which Israel vehemently denies.",
      "This time, he worked in Al-Aqsa hospital in Deir al-Balah in the centre of the territory and then in Nasser hospital in the south of Gaza.",
      "He has been working for Humanity Auxilium in Gaza as part of a wider World Health Organization (WHO) programme.",
      "He was in Nasser hospital when it was hit by an Israeli air strike, targeting Ismail Barhoum, the Hamas finance chief.",
      "Hamas said that Barhoum was being treated for injuries that he suffered in an earlier Israeli attack. The Israeli military denied this, saying he was in the hospital \"in order to commit acts of terrorism\".",
      "Dr Perlmutter has told the BBC that Barhoum was in the hospital to receive further medical treatment. He says that as a patient in hospital, Barhoum had a right to be protected under the Geneva Convention.",
      "The human cost of the latest Israeli offensive was exemplified for Dr Perlmutter by two 15-year-olds - including the girl on the bicycle - who were brought into the operating room in each of the hospitals he was working in, a week apart.",
      "\"They were both macerated and shredded by Apache gunships,\" Dr Perlmutter says.",
      "The girl will, in his words, \"be lucky if she keeps three of her limbs\".",
      "Dr Perlmutter says that people at the scene told the ambulance crew who brought the young girl into the hospital that she was hit by gunfire from an Israeli military helicopter.",
      "He says that she had been riding her bicycle by herself and she arrived at the hospital without a backpack or anything else that might have aroused suspicion. Graphic images from the operating table show catastrophic wounds to her leg and arm.",
      "The boy was driving in a car with his grandmother after receiving warnings to evacuate from the north, Dr Perlmutter says.",
      "\"Then the car was attacked by two Apache gunships. The grandmother was shredded at the scene and died,\" he said.",
      "\"The boy came in without a foot on his right side, the vascular repair on his left side took five hours - the nerve repair on his left side failed and he had a blackened hand the next day that required amputation at the level of his elbow - his left leg will require multiple surgeries for reconstruction and he has a chest wound. He may not have survived.\"",
      "Dr Perlmutter has also provided graphic photos of the boy's wounds.",
      "In a statement, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it \"does not target uninvolved individuals.\"",
      "\"The IDF operates in accordance with international law, targeting only military objectives while taking feasible measures to mitigate harm to civilians,\" it told the BBC.",
      "The statement also said that the IDF had not been provided with \"sufficient information\" to directly address the incidents that Dr Perlmutter described.",
      "\"The IDF takes action to address irregular incidents that deviate from its orders. The IDF examines such incidents and takes appropriate measures where justified,\" it said.",
      "Under such conditions, Dr Perlmutter stressed the commitment and dedication of the Palestinian medical staff - above and beyond the efforts of foreign doctors like himself.",
      "\"The stress levels on us are not even approachable to what happens even to the Palestinian medical students that work with us, whose stress levels are insane, as with the nurses and the techs in the operating room, let alone the Palestinian surgeons,\" he said.",
      "\"They all abandon their families, they volunteer and often work without pay.  They work the same hours that we do - and we get to go home in a month, which they don't. They still have to return to the squalor of their tents where there's often 50 people living in a tent built for 20 - and sharing one toilet.\"",
      "Most hospitals across Gaza are out of operation or barely managing to function. Dr Perlmutter compared the medical facilities in Gaza to where he lives in North Carolina. There are multiple trauma centres there, but they would have been overwhelmed, he says, if they had to deal with the mass influx of casualties that resulted from the first day of Israel's resumption of its war against Hamas.",
      "\"The small community hospital, Al-Aqsa, is a tenth the size of any of the facilities in my home state - maybe smaller - and it did well to manage those horrible injuries - nevertheless, because of lack of equipment, many, many of those patients died, who would certainly not have died at a better equipped hospital,\" he said.",
      "On Saturday the UN's humanitarian chief Tom Fletcher described the current situation in Gaza as dire.",
      "\"All entry points into Gaza are closed for cargo since early March. At the border, food is rotting, medicine expiring and vital medical equipment is stuck,\" he said.",
      "\"If the basic principles of humanitarian law still count, the international community must act to uphold them.\"",
      "On 2 March the Israeli government closed border crossings with Gaza and halted humanitarian aid. It said this was in response to what it called the refusal by Hamas of a new US proposal to extend the first stage of the ceasefire and hostage release deal, rather than negotiating a second phase.",
      "\"When Israel resumed its attacks, it was almost identical to when they bombed incessantly when I was here a year ago,\" Dr Perlmutter says. \"The only difference is now instead of bombing people in buildings, they were bombing people in tents.\"",
      "The Israeli army has regularly claimed that Hamas operates from areas where civilians are taking shelter. It says that it does not target civilians and takes measures to avoid civilian casualties.",
      "The International Criminal Court (ICC) last year issued arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former defence minister Yoav Gallant over alleged war crimes, saying it found reasonable grounds to believe that \"each bear criminal responsibility... for the war crime of intentionally directing an attack against the civilian population\".",
      "They deny this, and Netanyahu condemned the warrants as \"antisemitic\".",
      "Israeli attacks have killed more than 15,000 Palestinian children in Gaza, the Hamas-run health ministry has reported.",
      "And since the IDF broke a ceasefire and resumed its strikes on 18 March, 921 Palestinians have been killed, the ministry said.",
      "Dr Perlmutter warns that if there are more mass casualty events in Gaza from Israeli attacks, the lack of supplies in the two hospitals he's been working in means that more Palestinians will die from wounds that could have been treated."

Dr Alaneme said he would pay \u00a32,000 ($2,600) for each care home vacancy she was able to procure, and offered \u00a3500 ($650) commission on top.",

      "Our journalist, posing as a UK-based Ugandan businessman wanting to bring Ugandan construction workers over to join him, asked Mr Agyemang-Prempeh if this was possible.",
      "He replied it was - for the price of \u00a342,000 ($54,000) for three people.",

Srija and Arun, and Valli, are unique in choosing to live their everyday life out in the open.\"",
      "Srija and Arun's attempt to register their 2018 wedding was rejected, with the registrar arguing that the 1955 Hindu Marriage Act defined marriage as a union between a \"bride\" and a \"groom\", which therefore excluded trans women.",
      "But the couple, backed by LGBT activists, pushed back, taking their relationship into the public domain. The effort was worth it.",
      "They received global attention in 2019 when the Madras High Court in Chennai upheld their right to marry, stating that transgender people should be recognised as either a \"bride\" or \"groom\" as defined by the 1955 Hindu Marriage Act.",

      "The Thai capital, Bangkok, sits more than 1,000km (621 miles) from the epicentre of Friday's earthquake - and yet an unfinished high-rise building in the city was felled by it.",
      "Here we will explain what caused this earthquake, and how it was able to have such a powerful effect so far away.",
      "Follow updates on this story",
      "Follow updates on this story",
      "What caused the earthquake?",
      "The earth's upper layer is split into different sections, called tectonic plates, which are all moving constantly. Some move alongside each other, whilst others are above and below each other.",
      "It is this movement that causes earthquakes and volcanoes.",
      "Myanmar is considered to be one of the most geologically \"active\" areas in the world because it sits on top of the convergence of four of these tectonic plates - the Eurasian plate, the Indian plate, the Sunda plate and the Burma microplate.",
      "The Himalayas were formed by the Indian plate colliding with the Eurasian plate, and the 2004 Tsunami as a result of the Indian plate moving beneath the Burma microplate.",
      "Dr Rebecca Bell, a reader in tectonics at Imperial College London, said that to accommodate all of this motion, faults - cracks in the rock - form which allow tectonic plates to \"slither\" sideways.",
      "There is a major fault called the Sagaing fault, which cuts right through Myanmar north to south and is more than 1,200km (746 miles) long.",
      "Early data suggests that the movement that caused Friday's 7.7-magnitude earthquake was a \"strike-slip\" - where two blocks move horizontally along each other.",
      "This aligns with the movement typical of the Sagaing fault.",
      "As the plates move past each other, they can become stuck, building friction until it is suddenly released and the earth shifts, causing an earthquake.",
      "Why was the earthquake felt so far away?",
      "Earthquakes can happen at up to 700km (435 miles) below the surface. This one was just 10km from the surface, making it very shallow. This increases the amount of shaking at the surface.",
      "The earthquake was also very large - measuring 7.7 on the moment scale. It produced more energy than the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima, according to the US Geological Survey.",
      "The size of the quake was because of the type of fault, said Dr Bell.",
      "\"The straight nature [of the fault] means earthquakes can rupture over large areas - and the larger the area of the fault that slips, the larger the earthquake,\" she explained.",
      "\"There have been six magnitude 7 or greater earthquakes in this region in the last century.\"",
      "This straight fault also means a lot of the energy can be carried down its length - which extends for 1,200km south towards Thailand.",
      "When it comes to why the earth shook so much, scientists believe it is because the quake was a rare \"super shear\" - meaning energy from the rupture in the earth's crust built up because it was moving faster than seismic waves can travel through the earth.",
      "Seismologist Prof Frederik Tilmann, from the Helmholtz Centre for Geosciences in Germany, explained in analysis shared online that the rupture travelled at a speed of about 5km per second - making it \"the earthquake equivalent of a supersonic jet\".",
      "Because the fracture \"unzipped\" towards the south, it also directed this piled up energy towards the Thai capital, Bangkok, and this is why the earthquake had such an impact so far away.",
      "How earthquakes are felt at the surface is also determined by the type of soil.",
      "In soft soil - which is what Bangkok is built on - seismic waves (the vibrations of the earth) slow down and build up, getting bigger in size.",
      "So, Bangkok's geology would have made the ground shaking more intense.",
      "Why did just one skyscraper collapse in Bangkok?",
      "While dramatic footage has emerged of high-rise buildings in Bangkok swaying during the quake - knocking water from rooftop pools - the unfinished headquarters for the auditor-general's office Bangkok's Chatuchak district appears to be the only skyscraper to collapse.",
      "Prior to 2009, Bangkok did not have a comprehensive safety standard for constructing buildings to withstand earthquakes, according to Dr Christian M\u00e1laga-Chuquitaype, a senior lecturer in earthquake engineering at Imperial College London.",
      "This means that older buildings would have been particularly vulnerable.",
      "This is not unusual, as earthquake-resistant buildings can be more expensive to construct and Thailand, unlike Myanmar, does not frequently experience earthquakes.",
      "Dr Emily So, a professor of architectural engineering at the University of Cambridge, noted that older buildings can and have been strengthened, such as in California, western Canada and New Zealand.",
      "Prof Amorn Pimarnmas, president of the Structural Engineers Association of Thailand, said that while there were regulations in 43 provinces on earthquake-proofing buildings, less than 10% of buildings are estimated to be quake-resistant.",
      "Yet the building that collapsed was new - in fact, it was still under construction when the earthquake hit - and the updated building standards would have applied.",
      "Dr Pimarnmas said Bangkok's soft soil may have also played a part in its collapse, as it can amplify ground motions three or four times over.",
      "He added: \"However, there are other assumptions such as material (concrete and reinforcements) quality and some irregularity in [the] structural system. These remain to be investigated in detail.\"",
      "Having studied the video, Dr M\u00e1laga-Chuquitaype said it appears a \"flat slab\" construction process was being favoured - which is no longer recommended in earthquake-prone areas.",
      "\"A 'flat slab' system is a way of constructing buildings where floors are made to rest directly on columns, without using beams,\" he explained.",
      "\"Imagine a table supported only by legs, with no extra horizontal supports underneath.",
      "\"While this design has cost and architectural advantages, is performs poorly during earthquakes, often failing in a brittle and sudden (almost explosive) manner.\"",

      "Mandalay in Myanmar was much closer to where the ground slipped and would have experienced significantly more severe shaking than Bangkok.",
      "Although Myanmar regularly experiences earthquakes, Dr Ian Watkinson, a lecturer in earth sciences at Royal Holloway University, thought it was unlikely that many buildings were constructed to be earthquake-proof.",
      "\"General poverty, major political upheaval, alongside other disasters - e.g. the Indian Ocean tsunami in 2004 - has distracted the country from concentrating on the unpredictable risks from earthquakes,\" he said.",
      "\"This means that, in many cases, building design codes are not enforced, and construction happens in areas that could be prone to enhanced seismic risk, for example flood plains and steep slopes.\"",
      "Parts of Mandalay and its buildings also lie along the floodplain of the Ayerwaddy River. This makes them very vulnerable to a process called liquefaction.",
      "This happens when the soil has a high water content, and the shaking causes the sediment to lose its strength and behave like a liquid. This increases the risk of landslides and building collapses, as the ground can no longer hold them up.",
      "Dr So warned that there was \"always a chance\" of further damage to buildings near a fault line due to aftershocks - tremors that follow an earthquake, which can be caused by the sudden transfer of energy into nearby rock.",

      "But, in middle age, his career spiked again.",
      "Chamberlain became king of the 1980's TV mini-series: playing a western prisoner in Shogun and a catholic priest tempted by love in The Thorn Birds.",
      "He denied being gay when confronted by a French magazine in 1989, and did not speak publicly about his homosexuality until he turned 70.",
      "In interviews promoting his 2003 memoir, he advised other handsome leading actors to keep their sexuality to themselves.",

      "Richard Chamberlain dies aged 90",
      "George Richard Chamberlain was born on 31 March 1934, in Beverly Hills, California. He died one day before his 91st birthday.",
      "His salesman father had a problem with drink, which affected young Richard's childhood. He described himself as a \"shy, serious, lugubrious kid, painfully thin, with a long, sad face\".",
      "He admitted to being the most \"uncooperative kid in school\" but discovered a taste and a talent for athletics.",
      "At Pomona College, he was bitten by the acting bug - and a role in Bernard Shaw's Arms and the Man convinced him he had found his calling.",
      "Paramount Studios was interested in him, but thoughts of an acting career were put on hold after he was called up, serving 16 months with the US Army, rising to the rank of sergeant while stationed in Korea.",
      "On his discharge, he made a number of cameos in TV shows, including an episode of the popular Western, Gunsmoke.",
      "Not everyone had Chamberlain picked as a future star.",
      "He was handsome enough: with profiles at the time gushing over his \"fine-lined aristocratic face, suggesting a young Florentine noble - straight out of the Renaissance\".",
      "But, he was naturally diffident - which worked in his favour when he auditioned to play Dr James Kildare, a medical intern struggling to learn his profession, in NBC's new primetime medical drama.",
      "\"Perhaps it was inevitable,\" said one friend-and-rival. \"Who else could look so anti-sceptic as Dick?\"",
      "The series ran for nearly 200 programmes across five seasons.",
      "It broke new ground, by raising matters such as drug addiction - which had not previously been shown on US TV.",
      "There was a huge reaction from female fans.",
      "Chamberlain got 12,000 letters a week. In Pittsburgh, 450,000 people turned out to see him at a parade, and in New York, he nearly caused a riot when a child spotted him and called his name.",
      "The studio made the most of this attention, releasing novels, comics and games featuring Chamberlain's image.",
      "Fans would even write in asking \"Dr Kildare\" to solve their various medical problems.",
      "And Chamberlain had an unlikely hit single: Three Stars Will Shine Tonight, where romantic words were added to the show's distinctive opening theme tune.",
      "He won a Golden Globe Award for best TV actor in 1963. But, three years later audiences began to wane, and NBC pulled the plug.",
      "Now an international star, Chamberlain struggled to leave Kildare behind.",
      "In 1966, he hoped to break into films, but reviews slated his performance in the light romantic comedy, Joy in the Morning.",
      "Audiences, they said, laughed in \"all the wrong places\". So, he resolved to ignore Hollywood and make a living on the stage.",
      "He got off to a rocky start when a musical version of Breakfast at Tiffany's - in which he starred opposite Mary Tyler Moore - closed after just four shows.",
      "The production is still seen as one of Broadway's biggest ever turkeys. But a move to England gave him a chance of reinventing himself as a 'serious actor.'",
      "In 1967, there were starring roles in Henry James' Portrait of a Lady and opposite Katherine Hepburn in a satirical comedy called The Madwoman of Chaillot.",
      "And, two years later, he became the first American to play Hamlet at the Birmingham Repertory Theatre since the great John Barrymore in 1925.",
      "This time, the reviews were excellent and he revisited the role of Denmark's most tortured prince for a television version for Hallmark.",
      "But Chamberlain was cast as Tchaikovsky in Ken Russell's overblown biopic, The Music Lovers, in which he starred opposite Glenda Jackson.",
      "The critics rubbished the film, in which great play was made of the relationship between a composer with repressed homosexual tendencies and his nymphomaniac wife, although it later became something of a cult success.",
      "Chamberlain went on to play Lord Byron opposite Sarah Miles in Lady Caroline Lamb and the swashbuckling French swordsman Aramis in Richard Lester's The Three Musketeers.",
      "He also appeared - along with half of Hollywood - in the Towering Inferno, as a crooked electrical engineer whose corner-cutting leads to the spectacular destruction of a 138 floor building.",
      "In 1977, the TV series Roots - set in the era of American slavery - drew huge audiences and was nominated for nearly 40 Emmy awards.",
      "It sparked a revival of the mini-series which drew Chamberlain back to television.",
      "He beat Roger Moore and Albert Finney to be cast as John Blackthorn - a captive English navigator in 17th Century Japan - in Shogun.",
      "The series was shown on NBC over five nights in 1980, with audiences reaching nearly 30 million.",
      "Having won a Golden Globe, Chamberlain then picked up another as Father Ralph de Bricassart in The Thorn Birds, a priest torn between God and his sexual longing for the actress, Rachel Ward.",
      "It was even more successful than Shogun, winning an audience of 60% of television viewers and 16 Emmy nominations.",
      "In the 1990s, Chamberlain's career began to wane.",
      "There were a succession of solid, rather than outstanding, performances in made-for-TV films and endless guest appearances in other people's shows.",
      "These included a sequel to The Thorn Birds called The Missing Years, with Amanda Donohoe replacing Rachel Ward.",
      "In 2003, long after he had stopped playing romantic leading men, Chamberlain published his biography Shattered Love, in which, for the first time, he confirmed he was gay.",
      "Despite a relationship of more than 30 years with the actor and director Martin Rabbett, with whom he'd once starred in the film Allan Quatermain and the Lost City of Gold, they had kept their private life private.",
      "\"I thought there was something very, very deeply wrong with me,\" he said, \"and I wanted to cover it up. I remember making a pact with myself that I would never, ever reveal this secret, ever.\"",
      "Chamberlain and Rabbett went their separate ways in 2010.",
      "In later years, Chamberlain was happy to play a gay man, notably in Desperate Housewives and Will & Grace.",
      "He continued to perform in musical theatre, including touring productions of Spamalot, My Fair Lady and The Sound of Music.",
      "But he never regretted hiding his sexuality to protect his career.",
      "\"I would have been a happier person being out of the closet and being free,\" he told El Pais in 2024. \"But I had other motives that made me happy. I was a working actor and for me, that was most important.\"",
      "He will be remembered as the king of the TV mini-series: the dashing leading man in everything from Dr Kildare to The Thorn Birds.",
      "Despite attempts to reinvent himself as a serious stage actor, he was at his best on the small screen, entertaining millions watching at home on the sofa.",
      "For, although there were always better actors than Richard Chamberlain, few rivalled his ability to hold a television audience."

    "title": "Trump wants India to buy US corn - but here's why it probably won't",
    "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c204q6n0lzvo",
    "published": "Sun, 30 Mar 2025 22:36:59 GMT",
    "summary": "India feeds over a billion people, yet low yields and poor infrastructure keep agriculture lagging.",
    "story": [
      "Why won't India buy even a single bushel of American corn?",
      "That's the question US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick raised recently while criticising India's trade policies, taking a swipe at its market restrictions.",
      "In another interview, Lutnick accused India of blocking US farmers and urged it to open its agricultural market - suggesting quotas or limits as a possible approach.",
      "Agriculture is a key battleground in US President Donald Trump's escalating trade war, with tit-for-tat or reciprocal tariffs set to kick in on 2 April.",
      "Tariffs are taxes charged on goods imported from other countries.Trump has repeatedly branded India a \"tariff king\" and a \"big abuser\" of trade ties.",
      "For years, Washington has pushed for greater access to India's farm sector, seeing it as a major untapped market. But India has fiercely protected it, citing food security, livelihoods and interests of millions of small farmers.",
      "To be sure, India's transformation from a food-deficient nation to a food-surplus powerhouse is one of its biggest success stories.",
      "In the 1950s and '60s, the country relied on food aid to feed its population, but a series of agricultural breakthroughs changed that. India became self-sufficient in staples, and became the world's largest milk producer. Rapid growth in  horticulture, poultry and aquaculture expanded its food basket.",
      "Today, India is not just feeding its 1.4 billion people but, as the world's eighth-largest agri-produce exporter, also shipping grains, fruits and dairy worldwide.",
      "Yet, despite such major gains, Indian agriculture still lags in productivity, infrastructure and market access. Global price volatility and climate change add to the challenge. Crop yields lag far behind the global best. Small landholdings worsen the problem - Indian farmers work with less than a hectare on average, while their American counterparts had over 46 hectares in 2020.",
      "No surprise then that productivity remains low, even though farming remains India's backbone, supporting over 700 million people, nearly half the country's population. Agriculture employs nearly half of India's workforce but accounts for just 15% of GDP. In comparison, less than 2% of the US population depends on farming. With limited manufacturing jobs, more people are stuck in low-paying farm work, an unusual trend for a developing country.",
      "This structural imbalance also shapes India's trade policies. Despite its farm surplus, India keeps tariffs high to shield its farmers from cheap imports. It maintains moderate to high tariffs - ranging from zero to 150% - on farm imports.",
      "The weighted average tariff - the average duty rate per imported product - in India on US farm products is 37.7%, compared to 5.3% on Indian agricultural goods in the US, according to the Delhi-based think tank Global Trade Research Initiative (GTRI).",
      "Bilateral farm trade between India and the US is modest, at just $8bn (\u00a36.2bn).",
      "India mainly exports rice, shrimp, honey, vegetable extracts, castor oil and black pepper, while the US sends almonds, walnuts, pistachios, apples and lentils.",
      "But as the two countries work on a trade deal, experts say Washington now wants to push \"big-ticket\" farm exports - wheat, cotton, corn and maize - to narrow its $45bn trade deficit with India.",
      "\"They're not looking to export berries and stuff this time. The game is much bigger,\" says Biswajit Dhar, a trade expert from the Delhi-based Council for Social Development think tank.",
      "Pushing India to lower farm tariffs, cut price support and open up to genetically modified (GM) crops and dairy ignores the fundamental asymmetry in global agriculture, experts argue.",
      "The US, for instance, heavily subsidises its agriculture and protects farmers through crop insurance.",
      "\"In some cases,\" says Ajay Srivastava of GTRI, \"US subsidies exceed 100% of production costs, creating an uneven playing field that could devastate India's smallholder farmers.\"",
      "Abhijit Das, former head of the Centre for WTO Studies at the Indian Institute of Foreign Trade, says \"the key thing to remember is that agriculture in the two countries is entirely different\".",
      "\"The US has commercial agriculture, while India relies on intensive, subsistence farming. It's a question of the livelihoods of millions of Indians versus the interests of US agribusiness.\"",
      "But India's agricultural challenges aren't just external. Mr Dhar says much of the sector's struggles are \"its own doing\". Smallholder farmers, owning over 85% of holdings, lack investment capacity, while the private sector shows little interest. Farming receives less than 6% of India's total government and private infrastructure investment, leaving irrigation and storage facilities underfunded.",
      "To protect millions of livelihoods, the government shields key crops like wheat, rice and dairy with import duties and price support. \"But even that doesn't inspire confidence,\" he says.",
      "Four years ago, tens of thousands of farmers held protests demanding better prices and legal guarantees of minimum government support-price for staples, mainly wheat and rice.",
      "\"Even relatively well-off farmers selling surpluses don't see a turnaround anytime soon. And if they feel that way, imagine the plight of subsistence farmers,\" says Mr Dhar.",
      "Beyond domestic discontent, trade negotiations add another layer of complexity.",
      "Mr Das says the real challenge for India will be how \"to have an agreement with the US that takes into account US export interest in agriculture while balancing India's interests in the farm sector\".",
      "So what's the way forward?",
      "\"India must not yield to US pressure to open its agriculture sector,\" says Mr Srivastava. He warns that doing so would disrupt millions of livelihoods, threaten food security and flood local markets with cheap imports.",
      "\"India must prioritise its national interest and protect its rural economy. Trade cooperation should not come at the cost of our farmers, food sovereignty or policy autonomy.\"",
      "In the long run, experts say India must modernise its agriculture, making farming more remunerative, and become more competitive to boost exports. Unupom Kausik of agri-business Olam estimates that with top global yields, India could generate a surplus of 200 million metric tonnes of paddy - enough to supply global trade and combat hunger.",
      "\"In a way, Trump is holding up a mirror to us. We've done little to invest in agriculture's productive capacity,\" says Mr Dhar. \"For now, buying time is the best strategy - maybe offering the US cheaper imports of industrial goods as a trade-off.\"",
      "But for the best outcome, he says, India will have to \"play hardball. Basically, tell the US - we're open to negotiations on other fronts, but don't destabilise our agriculture\".",
      "Clearly India's challenge is to negotiate from a position of strength - offering just enough to keep Washington at the table while safeguarding its rural backbone. After all, in global trade as in farming, timing and patience often yield the best harvest. The jury is out on whether Trump is willing to wait."

      "Born George Richard Chamberlain on March 31, 1934 in Beverly Hills, California, he attended Beverly Hills High and later Pomona College, where he graduated with a degree in art. After a two-year stint in the U.S. Army, stationed in Korea, Chamberlain launched his career when he earned his first TV appearance as a guest spot on Alfred Hitchcock \"Presents.\"",
      "The role that put him on the map was the lead in the TV show \"Dr. Kildare,\" which earned Chamberlain the first of three Golden Globes in his career.",
      "He went on to star in notable films including \"Petulia,\" The Three Musketeers,\" \"The Music Lovers,\" and Peter Weir's \"The Last Wave.\"",
      "His forte, however, remained in the small screen, where he portrayed the likes of King Edward VIII, Octavius Caesar, and Scott Fitzgerald.",
      "Chamberlain also had a brief, yet successful, period as a recording artist, mostly romantic ballads, and was nominated for a Grammy.",
      "On the stage, Chamberlain played the title role in \"Hamlet\" for the Birmingham Repertory Theatre in England. On Broadway, Chamberlain appeared in \"My Fair Lady\" and \"The Sound of Music.\" In addition to successful tours with \"My Fair Lady\" and \"The Sound of Music,\" Chamberlain also played King Arthur on the national tour of the musical \"Spamalot.\"",
      "Other TV and movie appearances included \"The Drew Carey Show,\" \"Nip/Tuck,\" \"I Now Pronounce You Chuck & Larry,\" \"Brothers & Sisters\" and \"We are the Hartmans.\"",
      "He earned the title of \"King of the Miniseries\" when he appeared in \"Centennial,\" \"Shogun,\" and \"The Thorn Birds.\"",
      "In 2003, Chamberlain came out as gay in his memoir, \"Shattered Love,\" saying \"I can talk about it now because I'm not afraid anymore.\"",
      "\"When I grew up, being gay, being a sissy or anything like that, was verboten,\" he told \"Dateline.\" \"I disliked myself intensely and feared this part of myself intensely and had to hide it.\"",
      "Apart from acting and singing, ecological matters were a subject close to Chamberlain's heart. He had lobbied long to save the Tuolomne River, which originates in Yosemite National Park in California. His efforts helped to put the river under the National Wild and Scenic System, a legislation that protects the river.",

    "published": "Sun, 30 Mar 2025 12:16:24 -0400",
    "summary": "President Trump named himself the storied Washington arts center's chairman and replaced board members with Trump allies. Since then, the center has been rocked with cancellations, resignations, and questions about its mission.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump is taking center stage at the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington, D.C. \"We are going to make a lot of changes,\" he said earlier this month, \"including the seats, the decor, pretty much everything. It needs a lot of work.\"",
      "He's directing many of those changes as the new chairman of the board. Out are all of President Joe Biden's appointees, replaced with Trump allies.",
      "The Trump White House says an overhaul is needed because the marquee arts center is, in their words, \"woke \u2026 and broke.\"",
      "Last month, Deborah Rutter was fired as president of the Kennedy Center after serving for more than a decade. Asked whether the arts institution is broke, Rutter replied, \"The Kennedy Center has the most complicated financial model, and that is true of every nonprofit arts organization.\"",
      "It has a budget of $268 million, with $43 million coming from the federal government. In 2023, the Kennedy Center had a $6 million surplus, even though it is not supposed to be a money-making enterprise. \"We're a nonprofit organization,\" Rutter said. \"It's not intended to make money.\"",
      "Its budget comes mostly from donations. Billionaire businessman and former chairman David Rubenstein has given more than $100 million. He, too, was fired last month. Rutter said, \"To have us both leaving at the same time does cause me some worry, because of the sense of understanding of structure, decision-making, how we go about interpreting our mission, all of those kinds of things.\"",
      "The Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts was founded in 1971 as a national cultural center and memorial to President John F. Kennedy. Its annual honors ceremony, which airs on CBS, features the best in music, theater and dance.",
      "But now, conservatives charge the center is \"too liberal,\" highlighting three drag events last year, including a \"Broadway Drag Brunch.\"",
      "Asked whether it was a mistake to host drag shows, Rutter replied, \"I don't think so. I believe that everybody in America has the opportunity to be seen, and to be seen at your national cultural center.\"",
      "She pointed out that the shows Trump referred to in a social media post (\"THIS WILL STOP,\" he promised) represented just three of the 2,000 performances that took place at the Kennedy Center last year.",
      "Asked why the focus was on three drag shows, Rutter replied, \"I can't actually imagine. Drag has been around for centuries. Shakespeare performed in drag, the original Shakespeare.\"",
      "President Trump boycotted the Kennedy Center Honors during his first term, after criticism from honorees like Norman Lear. So, what does the new chairman have planned now? In audio obtained by \"CBS Sunday Morning,\" he suggests a new host \u2013 himself:",
      "\"The king of ratings, right? Whether we like it or not, the king of ratings! So, if I was the host of the Honors, and we'll go slightly more conservative, if you don't mind, with some of the people\u2026\"",
      "So, what kind of people does President Trump want to honor? Paolo Zampolli, a longtime friend of the president who has been on the board since 2020, said, \"There were mentioned a list of people, I remember the name of Pavarotti. I remember the name of Andrea Bocelli. They wanted to do something about Elvis Presley.\"",
      "Zampolli has suggested changes to make the Kennedy Center \"better\": \"We're on the Potomac River. We could have a little marina where in the weekend boats can come, and nice cafes, nice location where they can spend the weekend there and make it like a destination. Other things that I suggested is branch franchises around the world.\"",
      "Another idea? Sending art to the International Space Station. \"My idea was to have, not Michelangelo, not Picasso, but you know, living contemporary artists to create very small pieces of art,\" Zampolli said, \"One that can be displayed inside the ISS. One can be thrown in LEO, low orbit, that can circulate in the orbit. And one can be auctioned on the ground of the Kennedy Center, because they need to raise money.\"",
      "Some artists (including those who are LGBTQ) have expressed the belief that they won't be welcome at the Kennedy Center. But Zampolli said, \"I don't think the president have anything against these kind of people. I don't understand what is things 'inclusion' or this 'woke.' The Kennedy Center is accessible for everybody, and has to represent the agenda of America.\"",
      "Not everyone agrees. One thing you won't see at the Center is the musical \"Hamilton.\" Producers cancelled shows after President Trump became chairman. The president's response? \"I never liked 'Hamilton' very much. I never liked it.\"",
      "There have been several other high-profile cancellations and resignations; and Vice President JD Vance was boo-ed at a recent performance.",

      "Musician Ben Folds is among those who resigned, after serving as the artistic advisor of the National Symphony Orchestra at the Center. He was part of the Kennedy Center's leadership during the first Trump administration.",
      "Asked whether there was any political involvement then, Folds replied, \"Never saw anything like this. This is new, and it was quite sudden. Let's say I get in an artist that has different views than the president. Do they feel safe being themselves? Do they feel safe saying what they believe? They're not political shows, but you can express what you'd like to.\"",
      "And is that no longer the case? \"Well, I suspect it's no longer the case,\" Folds said. \"There is an instinct, an authoritarian instinct, that is true in all authoritarian times in history: Take control of the culture, take control of the arts early on.\"",

      "Now, Rutter says she hopes the institution's founding message isn't forgotten. \"I often go back to Eisenhower's words, and then Kennedy's words, to think about, who are we? What do we do? We believe that all of Americans should be seen and should feel welcome at the Kennedy Center.\"",

    "published": "Sun, 30 Mar 2025 12:06:41 -0400",
    "summary": "To young Brandi Carlile, a girl coming of age and struggling with her own sexuality, Elton John was a flicker of hope in a confusing world. Today, the two music superstars are friends and collaborators, recording an album together, \"Who Believes in Angels?\"",
    "story": [
      "Sir Elton John has millions of fans all over the world, but few of them as devoted as a young girl who first heard his music more than 30 years ago.",
      "In 1992, Brandi Marie Carlile was a kid living in a single-wide trailer in rural Washington State, and to her, Elton John was everything. Young Brandi collected everything about him she could get her hands on \u2013 records, photos, even an Elton John book she borrowed from a library 33 years ago, and kept(!). \"The date is still on here. Boulevard Park Library, May 10, 1992. It's all time stamped. And they're gonna have to come and get it!\"",
      "Little Brandi is now music superstar Brandi Carlile, but to a young girl coming of age and struggling with her own sexuality, Elton John was a flicker of hope in a confusing world. She loved him, and said so in writing, covering an entire page front to back with \"I love Elton John.\" \"It's insane,\" she said. \"I look at it now. I just can't believe what happened in my life to get me to where I am now. It's such a strange thing. It makes you wonder, it just makes you wonder. I do love Elton John!\"",
      "As a kid, she never dreamed she'd get to actually meet him one day, but sometimes dreams have a funny way of coming true. Now they're not only friends, but collaborators. It started a few years back when Carlile wrote to John out of the blue, and asked him to play piano on her new record.\u00a0 Long story short, he said yes, and they grew to be the best of friends \u2013 appearing together, performing together, even vacationing together with their families.",
      "And now, they're about to release an album they made together, recorded at Sunset Sound in Hollywood. It's Brandi Carlile's eighth studio album, and Elton John's 33rd.",
      "So, why did they decide to do an entire album together? John said, \"She's someone I wanted to work with for so long because I know how great she is. I know how her voice is, and I knew what she's capable of, and I wanted to push her more. And I wanted her to push me more. So, I wanted to make a record that was full of energy and great songs. And it turned out really brilliantly.\"",
      "There were cameras in the studio to capture all the highs, and a few of the lows. \"I didn't even think of them being there,\" John said.",
      "\"Yeah, I never saw one,\" Carlile said.",
      "It got tense at times (John admits, \"I haven't really seen the footage, but a lotta people say it's really, really very moving. And all of my behavior is not so moving!\"), but for Brandi, it was still the greatest show on Earth. \"It really felt like I was watching Mozart or, like, one of the great composers,\" she said. \"Stream of consciousness through their entire body, create music in a way that I've never seen. And I was so close. I had a front-row seat.\"",
      "John called it \"one of the greatest musical experiences of my life.\"",
      "Elton John and Brandi Carlile perform \"Swing For The Fences\":",
      "The fact that John got through the recording process at all is remarkable. For the past year, he's been fighting a severe eye infection that's left him nearly blind. But he says that, all things considered, he's doing all right. \"Medically, I'm fit as I've ever been,\" he said. \"I have checkups every month. But the eyesight thing is a bit of a bind, because I haven't been able to watch anything for about seven months. I haven't been able to read. I haven't been able to watch television or anything.",
      "\"But you know what? I've come to the conclusion that if we can't find a solution to it, and this is what it's like for the rest of my life, then I'm okay,\" he said. \"I can still play the piano. I can still sing, which is a gift. My life's fantastic. It's still the greatest gift that anyone could have.\"",
      "These days, John, who turned 78 this past week, is counting his blessings. But the final track on the album really struck a nerve: \"When This Old World Is Done With Me,\" co-written by longtime collaborator Bernie Taupin.",
      "He got very emotional in the studio while recording it: \"Well, I started singing, and I thought the verse was really beautiful. But then I had no idea what was coming. And when I got to the chorus, I realized what was coming, and I just broke down. And I sobbed, and I sobbed, and I sobbed, because it's about my death, basically. And when you get to my age, and a certain age, you think about mortality, because I wanna spend so much time with my children and David and my friends, that you want every single moment to count. And so, this was a song about I don't want to die. I wanna be with my children. I wanna be with David forever. And so, it really got to me.\"",
      "David is husband David Furnish. The two were married in 2014. They have two sons, Zachary and Elijah.",
      "Dad might be a global superstar, but there's no doubt where his heart is. Asked what he is most proud of, John replied, \"Yeah, my kids. My husband. That's it. All I want on my gravestone is, 'He was a great dad.' Nothing to do with music. 'He was a great dad.' That's all I care about.\"",
      "Their new album will be released this week, and for Carlile, it's still a little hard to believe: \"Yeah, it's so weird. Is it not? It's brilliant. Like, it's a wonderful thing. I hope everybody can take some hope and beauty and mysticism from the fact that this has happened. If it could happen to 11-year-old single-wide mobile home Brandi Carlile, it could really happen to anyone.\"",
      "Turns out these two friends don't just lean on each other; they push each other to new heights. The title track of their album is \"Who Believes In Angels?\" But maybe Elton John and Brandi Carlile are angels for each other.",
      "Elton John and Brandi Carlile perform \"Who Believes In Angels?\":",
      "John said, \"God, it was a challenge. But that's what life's all about. If you don't have a challenge at 76, then never give up. Never coast. There are so many artists that coast that don't make new songs. They just go around and play their hits, like I did. I didn't wanna do it with this record. I wanted a new start. I want a fresh start.",

    "summary": "President Trump signed an executive order targeting funding for Smithsonian Institution programs that he says contain \"divisive, race-centered ideology.\"",
    "story": [
      "President Trump on Thursday signed an\u00a0executive order\u00a0targeting funding for programs at the\u00a0Smithsonian Institution\u00a0that contain what he characterizes as \"divisive, race-centered ideology\" in his latest broadside against a liberalism that has critiqued Western culture and values.",
      "The president said in the order that there has been a \"concerted and widespread\" effort over the past decade to rewrite American history by replacing \"objective facts\" with a \"distorted narrative driven by ideology rather than truth.\" He said this narrative has cast the \"founding principles\" of the U.S. in a \"negative light.\"",
      "\"The Smithsonian Institution has, in recent years, come under the influence of a divisive, race-centered ideology,\" Mr. Trump said in the order. \"This shift has promoted narratives that portray American and Western values as inherently harmful and oppressive.\" He pointed to a sculpture exhibit at the Smithsonian American Art Museum representing that \"[s]ocieties including the United States have used race to establish and maintain systems of power, privilege, and disenfranchisement.\"",
      "The order tasks Vice President JD Vance, who serves on the Smithsonian Institution's Board of Regents, with overseeing efforts to \"remove improper ideology\" from all areas of the institution, including its museums, education and research centers and the National Zoo.",
      "It marks Mr. Trump's latest salvo against cultural pillars of society, such as universities and art, that he sees as out of step with conservative sensibilities. He recently had himself installed as chairman of the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts with the aim of overhauling programming, including the annual Kennedy Center Honors awards show. The administration also recently forced Columbia University to make a series of policy changes by threatening the Ivy League school with the loss of several hundred million dollars in federal funding.",
      "The executive order also hints at the return of statues and monuments of Confederate figures, many of which were taken down or replaced around the country after the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis in 2020 and the rise of the Black Lives Matter movement, which is detested by Trump and other conservatives.",
      "The president directed the secretary of the interior to determine whether, since Jan. 1, 2020, \"public monuments, memorials, statues, markers, or similar properties within the Department of the Interior's jurisdiction have been removed or changed to perpetuate a false reconstruction of American history, inappropriately minimize the value of certain historical events or figures, or include any other improper partisan ideology.\"",
      "The order also calls for improvements to Independence Hall in Philadelphia by July 4, 2026, in time for the 250th anniversary of the signing of the Declaration of Independence.",
      "Mr. Trump singled out the National Museum of African American History and Culture, which opened in 2016 near the White House, the Women's History Museum, which is in development, and the American Art Museum for criticism.",
      "\"Museums in our Nation's capital should be places where individuals go to learn \u2014 not to be subjected to ideological indoctrination or divisive narratives that distort our shared history,\" he said in the order.",

      "The Sex Pistols, the legendary English punk band that helped the underground subculture of the genre to reach mainstream heights, is going on its first North American tour in more than 20 years.",
      "The Pistols last went on a North American tour in 2003, when they were joined by original vocalist\u00a0John Lyndon (formerly Rotten).",
      "The 2025 iteration of the Pistols \u2014 original guitarist Steve Jones, drummer Paul Cook and bassist Glen Matlock joined by frontman Frank Carter (of Gallows, Pure Love and Frank Carter and the Rattlesnakes) \u2014 will hit the road on Sept. 16 at a very memorable stage: The Longhorn Ballroom in Dallas, Texas. It was the site of a particularly hostile show for the band when it first toured the U.S. in 1978.",
      "Jones told The Associated Press he recalls having \"pigs' hooves and bottles and whatnot slung at us by cowboys.\"",
      "It is one of a few dates featured in three \"Live in the U.S.A.\" albums, documenting the band's '78 run: Atlanta, Dallas and San Francisco. The latter will be released on April 25 and captures the show where the band originally called it quits.",
      "\"We were thinking of breaking up in San Francisco again,\" Jones joked.",
      "The 2025 tour is currently scheduled to conclude Oct. 16 at the Hollywood Palladium in Los Angeles. The band will hit Washington; Philadelphia; Brooklyn, New York; Montreal; Toronto; Cleveland; Detroit; Minneapolis; Denver; Seattle and San Francisco. Additional tour dates will be announced later.",
      "Pre-sale opens April 2 and 3.\u00a0Tickets go on sale\u00a0April 4 at 10 a.m. local time.",
      "They will perform the band's sole album, 1977's \"Never Mind the Bollocks, Here's the Sex Pistols Album\" live in its entirety as well as other material.",
      "So, why tour the U.S. and Canada now?",
      "\"Why not?\" Jones said.",
      "\"I think everybody needs this band right now. I think the world needs this band right now,\" Carter said. \"And I think definitely America is screaming out for a band like the Sex Pistols.\"",
      "\"At the end of the day, we're living in a really, really difficult time. So not only do people want to come and just be entertained, they want to enjoy themselves,\" he continued. \"Punk is an energetic music. It's one where you can go and vent and let your hair down, hopefully in a safe manner. Fingers crossed, no bottles or pigs' hooves.\"",
      "Carter fronted the Sex Pistols last year for a few U.K. dates. The band said they did not reach out to Lydon to see if he wanted to participate in this reunion tour.",
      "\"The last thing he wants to do is have anything to do with us right now,\" Jones said, referring to a previous lawsuit between the singer and the band over music use in\u00a0their TV series \"Pistol.\"\u00a0The judge ruled against Lydon's opposition.",
      "\"We wish him the best,\" Jones said.",
      "\"Good luck to him,\" Matlock added. \"I wish he thinks, maybe, 'good luck' to us. Probably doesn't. But over the years, John (has had) all our phone numbers, and I can't see many missed calls from him.\"",
      "As for the 2025 tour: Fans shouldn't expect the violence of their 1978 run, but they should anticipate a tighter performance.",
      "\"We're a bit older but we play just as well, if not better,\" Matlock said. \"And I think that's something that's got a great deal of aplomb that we're going to bring to the public over there.\"",
      "Does this mean there could be new Sex Pistols music in the future? \"It's early days,\" Jones said. \"Let's see what happens.\"",

      "The iconic Sundance Film Festival will be moving from Park City, Utah to Boulder, Colorado, starting in 2027, the festival and the Colorado Governor's Office announced on Thursday.",
      "The search for a new host city has been years in the making, with the festival announcing the search in 2023 and several cities, including Boulder, as possible new hosts being announced last year.",
      "\"Colorado is thrilled to welcome the Sundance Film Festival to its new home in Boulder starting in 2027,\" Colorado Gov. Jared Polis said in a statement. \"Here in our state we celebrate the arts and film industry as a key economic driver, job creator, and important contributor to our thriving culture. Now, with the addition of the iconic Sundance Film Festival, we can expect even more jobs, a huge benefit for our small businesses including stores and restaurants.\"",
      "\"This decision was informed by a detailed evaluation of the key components essential to creating our Festival. During the process, it became clear that Boulder is the ideal location in which to build our Festival's future, marking a key strategic step in its natural evolution,\" Sundance Institute Board Chair  Ebs Burnough said.",
      "The Sundance Film Festival takes place every January. The Boulder Film Festival will likely be pushed back by about a month, officials behind that festival previously told CBS News Colorado.",
      "Utah was home to the international film festival for 42 years, but festival organizers said the festival has outgrown its home.",
      "Since entering the selection process, state and local leaders in Colorado have mounted considerable efforts to get the festival moved to Boulder, citing the city's concentration of artists, its history of culture, and the revenue benefits to the city and state.",
      "\"I founded the Sundance Institute with a commitment to discovering and developing independent artists, with the Sundance Film Festival serving as the platform for stories to help expand audiences and broaden the landscape,\" Robert Redford, Sundance Institute president and founder, said in a statement. \"This move will ensure that the Festival continues its work of risk taking, supporting innovative storytellers, fostering independence, and entertaining and enlightening audiences. I am grateful to the Boulder community for its support, and I look forward to seeing what the future holds for the Festival there.\"",
      "As part of Boulder's efforts to attract Sundance, the state legislature is considering up to $34 million in refundable tax credits, which would kick in by 2027, when Sundance is set to relocate here. Some state lawmakers oppose that move, however, with one saying it was unfair to ask the entire state to subsidize what would largely only benefit one community.",
      "Nonetheless, the efforts didn't stop there. City leaders in Boulder previously said that local hotels have already committed to capping room price increases during the 11-day event.",
      "\"Our walkable downtown, iconic venues, and beautiful landscape at the base of the Rocky Mountains sets the stage for the Sundance Film Festival to flourish in its next chapter,\" said Charlene Hoffman, CEO of Visit Boulder. \"It's been a remarkable experience getting to share our vibrant community with the Sundance Institute and we eagerly await the Festival's debut in beautiful Boulder, Colorado with excitement and gratitude.\"",
      "A study by the State of Utah found Sundance had nearly 73,000 attendees in 2024, generating $132 million in economic output, $14 million in tax revenue, and $70 million in wages.",
      "\"Boulder is an art town, tech town, mountain town, and college town. It is a place where the Festival can build and flourish. This is the beginning of a bold, new journey as we invite everyone to be part of our community and to be entertained and inspired,\" the Sundance Institute's acting CEO Amanda Kelso said. \"We can't imagine a better fit than Boulder.\"",

    "story": [
      "President Trump's forthcoming tariffs on automobiles threaten\u00a0to make cars more expensive, and some consumers are responding by heading to dealerships before the levies go into effect.",
      "In an executive order signed on March 26, Mr. Trump said he will put a 25% tariff on vehicles and auto parts imported into the\u00a0U.S. Earlier this month, Mr. Trump issued a\u00a0one-month delay for U.S. automakers\u00a0on tariffs placed on imports from Canada and Mexico, trading partners that provide many of the car makers' vehicle parts and components.",
      "If the 25% levies are enacted, auto manufacturers will face higher costs and are likely to eventually\u00a0pass on\u00a0some of those price hikes to consumers, industry players say. With that in mind, analysts are advising shoppers in the market for new vehicles to buy them sooner in 2025 than later, as inventory that's currently on the lot is not subject to the auto tariffs.",
      "\"Vehicles on lots and the inventory that exists today has not been impacted by tariffs, so it's a good time to buy a car,\" Joe McCabe, president and CEO of AutoForecast Solutions, a provider of automobile industry insights, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"It has to fit within the financial boundaries of the consumer, but this would be the preferred time to do it.\"",
      "Burlington, Vermont-based artist Val Hird is among the car shoppers who rushed to lock in a deal on their vehicle of choice before April 2, which Mr. Trump has referred to as \"Liberation Day.\"",
      "A day before Mr. Trump announced plans to impose 25% tariffs on vehicles on auto parts imported into the U.S., Hird had decided to purchase a vehicle, she told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Hird said she had wanted a Toyota RAV4 Plug-in hybrid, but her local Toyota dealer did not have the car in stock. \"I would have ordered one, except we just found out there are going to be tariffs. So, we assumed if it's not yet in the country, or in transit to the country, that would probably throw it into the 'who knows what the price will be' category,\" she said of her reluctance to place an order on a new car.",
      "Instead, Hird located a used version of her preferred car model at another dealership in Rhode Island, which she \"leapt to the phone\" to buy.",
      "She ultimately paid $45,453 for the pre-owned Toyota hybrid. Had that particular model not been available, Hird said she would have forewent the purchase of a car altogether and waited to see how the trade war progressed.",
      "\"I don't live in a world where I can spend an extra $10,000,\" Hird said of the anticipated tariff-related price hikes on cars.",
      "Tariff talk at dealerships grows",
      "Analysts say that tariffs are top of mind for consumers, with dealers saying consumers are increasingly weaving talk of the levies into their car-buying conversations.",
      "Data from Cox Automotive, which owns several popular car insight sites, including Kelley Blue Book, Autotrader and Dealer.com, shows a dramatic uptick in car shopping activity in recent days. There was a 27% uptick in visits to Kelly Blue Book Thursday after Mr. Trump announced 25% auto tariffs.",
      "On Friday, users logged 54% more new car leads on Dealer.com, meaning they submitted inquiries to dealers about vehicles they were interested in buying. Auto Trader notched an uptick of 16% in used car leads.",
      "\"It makes a lot of sense; I would assume that people would have gotten started researching to see what things look like now,\" Erin Keating, executive analyst at Cox Automotive, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "More pressure on cost-conscious to buy now",
      "Car prices are all but guaranteed to rise when tariffs go into effect. By contrast, vehicles currently sitting on dealers' lots are insulated from the levies.",
      "\"If consumers are seeing prices on lots saying, 'here's the tariff adjustment cost,' they should challenge that, because sitting inventory is not subject to tariffs,\" Aaron Bragman, Detroit bureau chief of Cars.com, a car buying marketplace, told CBS MoneyWatch. He noted that existing inventory is relatively stable. \"There are vehicles to be had, we aren't seeing an inventory crunch right now.\"",
      "Indeed, McCabe said dealers are seeing increased interest in vehicles on lots from consumers, and \"are going to be more picky on their consumers to get the best price they can.\"",
      "Said McCabe, \"They know the supply and demand issue will change pretty quickly with the tariff impact.\"",

      "In particular, motorists on the lower end of the income scale should consider making their car purchases immediately, he said, because any kind of price hike could push them out of the market for a vehicle altogether.",
      "\"There's a cost-conscious consumer that if you start tariffing them, they'll stop buying the vehicle because it doesn't fit in their budget,\" McCabe said.",

    "published": "Mon, 31 Mar 2025 12:51:00 -0400",
    "summary": "These automakers are the most and least exposed to President Trump's sweeping tariffs on automobiles.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration's 25% tariffs on vehicles and auto parts imported into the U.S. could lead to sticker shock for American consumers, including for those buying cars manufactured domestically, analysts say.",
      "Few vehicle manufacturers will be spared by the fresh levies, which are aimed at revitalizing domestic automobile manufacturing. Industry analysts say the tax will surely raise car prices in the U.S. and squeeze some would-be car buyers out of the market.",
      "Some manufacturers could move a share of production to the U.S., but it would come \"at the expense of reduced competition, higher prices, and significantly lower production in the U.S.'s main trading partners,\" Oxford Economics analyst Abby Stamp said in a research note.",
      "The automobile supply chain is highly complex and intertwined with the economies of Mexico and Canada, from which American brands source finished vehicles and parts. Mr. Trump's tariff on passenger cars and light trucks imported into the U.S. will go into effect April 3, according to the executive order, and a 25% tariff on auto parts shipped from foreign countries goes into effect \"no later than May 3.\"",
      "The price of a typical car could rise by between $5,000 to $10,000 \"out of the gates\" due to the new tariffs, according to a March 31 estimate from Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives.",
      "Meanwhile, car insurance premiums are also likely to jump because the tariffs will make it more expensive to repair vehicles, partly due to higher costs for purchasing new auto parts.",
      "Average insurance premiums could rise to $2,759, or a 19% bump from the typical cost in the fourth quarter of 2024, according to a new projection from Insurify. That increase would come after car insurance costs jumped 11% in February from a year earlier, making it one of the fastest-rising components in the Consumer Price Index (CPI), which measures inflation.",
      "While all car manufacturers will be impacted by the new tariffs, according to analysts, some will be hit much harder than others.",
      "Tesla",
      "Tesla CEO Elon Musk, a close ally of Mr. Trump, posted on X Wednesday that the new tariffs would affect the company's American-made electric vehicles.",
      "\"Important to note that Tesla is NOT unscathed here. The tariff impact on Tesla is still significant,\" Musk wrote on X Wednesday. \"To be clear, this will affect the price of parts in Tesla cars that come from other countries. The cost impact is not trivial,\" he wrote in a later post.",
      "That said, Tesla is expected to be among the automakers that are least affected by the tariffs, given that its vehicles are made in the U.S., and most of their parts are sourced domestically, too. The EV brand does, however, rely on China for some batteries, \"so the tariffs will have an impact,\" Art Wheaton, a transportation industry expert and director of labor studies at Cornell's School of Industrial and Labor Relations, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Tesla rival Rivian could also be spared for similar reasons, according to UBS.",
      "\"We believe TSLA and RIVN could fare better as 100% of their production is in the U.S. (though not all components),\" UBS analysts said in a research note.",
      "General Motors",
      "General Motors, one of the so-called Big Three automakers, along with Stellantis and Ford, is widely expected to be the most exposed to the forthcoming auto tariffs. Headquartered in Detroit, the U.S. car company makes just 45% of vehicles it sells to U.S. customers domestically, leaving 55% of its lineup exposed to tariffs, according to Cox Automotive.",
      "GM, which makes Chevrolet, Buick, GMC and Cadillac vehicles, is heavily invested in Mexico and Canada, where it builds heavy-duty vehicles, according to Cornell's Wheaton.",
      "Stellantis",
      "Stellantis, whose brands include Jeep, Chrysler, Dodge and Ram, among others, is similarly susceptible to rising costs from the tariffs, as it makes between 73%-75% of vehicles for sale in the U.S. stateside, according to Cox Automotive.",
      "That means an $80,000 RAM truck from Stellantis could cost $100,000 once it reaches the U.S., under the new policy.",
      "\"The impact is quite large,\" Wheaton said.",
      "Ford",
      "Ford is among the car companies better positioned to weather the tariffs, according to Cox Automotive analyst Erin Keating, as 80% of its vehicles are manufactured in the U.S. and therefore would not be subject to the 25% tariff on passenger cars. However, any imported parts used in Ford's U.S.-manufactured vehicles could be tariffed at 25%.",
      "Ford vehicles made in the U.S. include the F-150 pickup truck lineup. Some of its smaller vehicles, including the Maverick pickup truck and Bronco Sport SUV are made in Mexico and \"will take a hit,\" said Wheaton.",
      "While domestic automakers will face increased costs, it's unclear how much of the tax they'll pass along to consumers. The\u00a0Wall Street Journal,\u00a0reported that Mr. Trump warned the CEOs of the Big Three not to raise car prices because of tariffs, according to people familiar with the matter.",
      "Toyota and Honda",
      "Japanese automakers Toyota and Honda export a large number of vehicles and auto parts from Japan to the U.S., which represents a sizable market for the companies. Both also operate big plants in Canada, Wheaten noted, leaving them particularly vulnerable to added costs from new tariffs.",
      "The same goes for South Korean automakers Hyundai and Kia.",
      "BMW and Volkswagen",
      "German automakers, including BMW and Volkswagen, which makes Audi vehicles, both operate big plants in Mexico.",
      "The May 3 auto-parts tariff will likely apply to engines and transmission systems, and hit the company \"heavily,\" according to Wheaton.",
      "BMW, for instance, makes a lot of engines in Germany, which it then ships to South Carolina, where the automaker manufactures SUVs. The company could be hit \"heavily,\" by the auto-parts tariffs, according to Wheaton.",
      "Mercedes-Benz operates similarly, sending engines and transmissions from Germany to a plant in Alabama, where the company manufactures SUVs. The 25% auto tariffs would also likely apply to fully assembled Mercedes vehicles shipped to the U.S.",
      "\"I don't think any brands will be spared, because none are 100% in the U.S.,\" Wheaton said. \"They all have products from Canada, Mexico or elsewhere. And even Tesla, which is the most American, still has non-U.S. content in their vehicles.\"",
      "Tariffs could spark affordability issues",
      "Even vehicles whose parts aren't subject to tariffs and that are assembled in the U.S. could face price hikes, as automakers attempt to spread new costs out across their lineups. While Cox Automotive expects price hikes of between 15-20% on vehicles that are caught in the tariffs' crosshairs, those that are exempt could still go up by about 5%, Keating noted.",
      "The auto tariffs could ignite new affordability challenges for consumers by moving lower-cost vehicles closer to, or in some cases over the $30,000 threshold.",
      "Take, for example, a Hyundai Venue, a subcompact crossover SUV, with an average current list price of $24,000. Under Mr. Trump's auto tariffs, that price could rise to about $28,500, adding more than $4,000 to an affordable design.",
      "\"Sub- $30,000 compact SUVs and crossovers that are the most popular are almost all foreign-made, with the exception of one or two,\" Keating said. \"So they'd all be subjected to the 25% tariffs.\"",
      "At the other end of the economic spectrum, luxury Italian car maker Ferrari on Thursday said it would hike prices on certain car models by 10% after April 1, citing Mr. Trump's auto tariffs. The vehicles subject to price increase include the Ferrari 296, SF90 and Roma, which already retail for hundreds of thousands of dollars each.",

    "published": "Mon, 31 Mar 2025 12:21:51 -0400",
    "summary": "Here's what to know about tariffs ahead of President Trump's plans to announce new import duties on April 2.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration is planning to impose a round of fresh tariffs on April 2, a day President Trump has dubbed \"Liberation Day.\" The announcement is viewed by economists as the culmination of his \"America First Trade Policy,\" an\u00a0executive order he signed on his first day in office aimed at revitalizing U.S. manufacturing.",
      "Mr. Trump has referred to his April 2 tariff announcement as \"the big one,\" suggesting that the plans may be more far reaching than the import levies he's already unleashed on goods from other nations, such as his March 26 declaration of 25% tariffs on vehicles and auto parts imported into the\u00a0U.S.",
      "\"For DECADES we have been ripped off and abused by every nation in the World, both friend and foe. Now it is finally time for the Good Ol' USA to get some of that MONEY, and RESPECT, BACK. GOD BLESS AMERICA!!!\" Trump said about his April 2 plans in a post\u00a0earlier this month on Truth Social.",
      "On April 2, Mr. Trump is expected to announce his administration's plans for so-called reciprocal tariffs, which he deems necessary to erase trade imbalances with nations that export more goods to the U.S. than they import from America. But the addition of broad-based tariffs to a host of imports is likely to heat up a global trade war that could, at least in the short term, boost prices for U.S. consumers and juice inflation.",
      "\"Tariffs are a tax on imported goods, and research shows that that majority gets passed along to consumers,\" Colin Grabow, associate director of the Herbert A. Stiefel Center for trade policy studies at the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Ultimately, the Trump administration's goal is to increase prices on imports to the point where it's economically favorable for companies to relocate their manufacturing to the U.S., he noted.",
      "\"If prices don't go up, it doesn't deter imports, and therefore there is no reason to set up shop in the U.S.,\" Grabow explained. \"Part of the logic is premised on prices going up, otherwise they are not going to accomplish their goal.\"",
      "Economists say that Mr. Trump's tariff agenda, including the uncertainty surrounding it, could drag down U.S. GDP by depressing financial markets and consumer sentiment.",
      "\"The main channel from trade policy uncertainty to GDP is via business investment. Under higher trade policy uncertainty, future revenue streams of an investment become more uncertain, raising the option value of delaying investment decisions until the situation is clearer,\" Oxford Economics analysts said in a research note.",
      "What tariffs will Trump announce April 2?",
      "Mr. Trump teased his April 2 announcement on Wednesday when he announced his new 25% tariffs on foreign-made cars and auto parts. \"That's Liberation Day, that's gonna be on the 2nd, and that's gonna be reciprocal, and I think people will be impressed,\" the president said.",
      "Reciprocal tariffs are designed to match the import duties placed on U.S. goods and services by other nations, as well as compensate for other trade barriers, according to the Yale Budget Lab, a non-partisan public policy think tank. According to a White House memo from Feb. 13, the U.S. faces additional trade barriers aside from tariffs such as regulatory requirements that can make it more difficult for American exports to reach other nations.",
      "While the size and scope of the reciprocal tariffs that Mr. Trump plans to announce are unknown, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent last week said the administration's reciprocal tariffs would target countries with the biggest trade surpluses, as well as those which have imposed the highest tariffs plus non-tariff trade barriers on U.S. goods.",
      "Multiple nations run large annual trade surpluses with the U.S., including Germany, Ireland and Italy in the European Union, as well as Vietnam, Japan and Taiwan. The U.S. also has a large trade deficit with China, although Mr. Trump has already imposed new tariffs on that nation.",
      "\"It'll be in many cases less than the tariff that they've been charging us for decades ... I think we're trying to keep it somewhat conservative,\" Mr. Trump said on March 26.",
      "Mr. Trump added that he'll introduce a reciprocal tariff policy on \"all countries,\" which he said would be \"very lenient.\"",
      "On Sunday, National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett told Fox News' Maria Bartiromo that there are 15 countries \"that we have massive, massive trade deficits with,\" but that Mr. Trump will ultimately decided how many countries will be subject to new tariffs Wednesday.",
      "Mr. Hassett also promoted tariffs as an effective tool for reshoring manufacturing to the U.S., saying \"it's going to be a boom,\" referring to auto manufacturing in particular.",
      "Meanwhile, additional tariffs are also slated to go into effect on April 2, with Mr. Trump's one-month delay on 25% tariffs on Canadian and Mexican imports set to expire that day. The 25% auto tariff announced by the president on March 26 is also scheduled to take effect on April 2.",
      "What are reciprocal tariffs?",
      "Reciprocal tariffs enacted by the U.S. would match foreign nations' levies and other trade policies on American goods.",
      "A reciprocal tariff policy would include calculating a country-specific number that the Trump administration deems representative of all trade barriers. But import restrictions other than tariffs, such as regulatory requirements, could be hard to quantify, economists say.",
      "\"There are a lot of intangibles, like testing regulations for different products in countries, or perceived openness to business with American companies,\" Simon Macadam, deputy chief global economist at Capital Economics, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"These are things you can't easily put a number on.\"",
      "Because of this complexity, some experts expect Trump's reciprocal tariffs could be more limited in scope, and might not be truly \"reciprocal\" because they may not exactly match other countries' levies.",
      "\"We shouldn't be surprised if some of the stuff is rolled back, or not as sweeping as maybe originally talked about, because logistically, from a practical perspective, running the calculations and coming up with a number is extremely time consuming,\" Grabow of the Cato Institute said.",
      "Wilbur Ross, who served as the U.S. Secretary of Commerce during the first Trump administration, agreed that a truly reciprocal tariff policy would be \"very complicated to get to work.\"",
      "\"If you were literally going to be reciprocal, you would put the same tariff on a product that comes into the U.S. as that country charges on products from the U.S.,\" he said. \"But the problem is you'd be charging a different tariff on the same item from different countries.\"",
      "That would create loopholes for exporters to ship products through lower-tariffed countries to the U.S., Ross added. \"It would make it easy for people to game the system,\" he said.",
      "What does Trump want to achieve?",
      "Through his \"Fair and Reciprocal Plan\" on trade, Mr. Trump is aiming to bring about three outcomes: Boost U.S. manufacturing jobs; close the $1.2 trillion U.S. trade deficit; and gain leverage over U.S. trade partners.",
      "But experts say that trade barriers such as tariffs may not be enough to revitalize U.S. manufacturing jobs, which have fallen sharply over the last few decades. Fewer than 13 million people are employed in manufacturing today, down from a peak of 19.6 million in 1979,\u00a0according to federal data.",
      "\"To a large extent, and particularly in low- and medium-tech industries, the economics of production will not be significantly altered by a 10-20% tariff,\" Macadam said. \"When labor costs in hubs like Mexico are one-fifth of what they are in the U.S., in order to induce companies to seriously relocate a lot of production back to the U.S. a 20% tariff isn't going to cut it.\"",
      "There's also the unknown of how long any new tariffs announced by Mr. Trump will remain in place. Such uncertainty could deter American or foreign businesses from investing heavily in re-shoring manufacturing to the U.S.",
      "\"Even if for some companies it gets to the point where it seems to make financial sense to move back to the U.S., there's the question of, 'Are these tariffs actually going to last a long time?'\" Macadam said. \"If you think the tariff is going to be there forever, then yeah, absolutely relocate. But if it's reversed or rates are lowered, then it would have been silly to relocate.\"",
      "What will tariffs mean for consumers?",
      "Consumers typically pay the price for tariffs, as companies have said they plan on passing off much of the costs to their customers.",
      "As a result, a round of fresh tariffs could boost inflation, economists say. According to an analysis by Oxford Economics, if the effective tariff rate on imports into the U.S. rises from their 2024 level of 2.5% to 10% in April, which is what Oxford Economics expects, prices in aggregate would rise by half a percentage point.",
      "\"Inflation was on trend to fall \u2014 now we expect it to rise,\" Michael Pearce, senior U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, told CBS MoneyWatch.",

    "summary": "Most Americans say the matter of Trump administration officials discussing U.S. military plans on the Signal app is serious.",
    "story": [
      "After a week that brought tough economic news and polling showing Americans'\u00a0views of the economy\u00a0are still sour, most say President Trump has focused too much on tariffs \u2014 which they believe will end up raising prices \u2014 and not enough on lowering prices.",
      "This has Americans collectively skeptical right now about the ability of Mr. Trump's policies to make them financially better off, a sentiment that was key to the success of his 2024 campaign.",
      "Yet that's balanced out for Mr. Trump today by continued majority approval on immigration and on his deportation program, specifically. That comes especially \u2014 but not exclusively \u2014 from his Republican base, many of whom say that's just as important as the economy in their evaluations.",
      "Meanwhile, the public continues to weigh the changes brought by the federal workforce reductions, with many believing they will impact programs they care about.",
      "But the matter involving administration officials' use of the Signal app, while seen as serious, does not seem tied to evaluations of Mr. Trump overall.",
      "From a list of items, most say the administration is focused too much on tariffs, and by contrast, is not focused enough on lowering prices.",
      "Donald Trump won the 2024 election in large part on the economy and the idea that he'd make Americans financially better off.",
      "Just before he took office, a sizable four in 10 felt his policies as president would do just that.",
      "Asked about what's happening today, just a quarter of Americans say those policies are making them financially better off. Nearly twice as many say he's making their finances worse.",
      "Even among Republicans, things have tempered. Just before he took office, three-fourths of Republicans said Mr. Trump's policies as president would make them better off, and now, under half of them say that's what is happening so far.",
      "Tariffs, or the threat of them, don't seem to be helping.",
      "Most oppose new tariffs, as they have for a while, and big numbers think that'll lead to higher prices in the short term.",
      "The administration has argued that tariffs will have long-term benefits, but people are more inclined to think they'll raise prices rather than lower them in the long term, too. Tariffs on imported cars in particular aren't popular, either.",
      "(Prices, of course, have been a key concern for years. They are the number one reason that people still rate the economy badly,\u00a0according to recent polling.)",
      "Importantly, though, Mr. Trump doesn't fully \"own\" the issue. Joe Biden still gets a little more blame for today's inflation rate than Mr. Trump does.",
      "Mr. Trump's approval for handling inflation specifically remains negative, and his rating on handling the economy in general has edged into negative territory since last month.",
      "That balances against net-positive ratings for immigration (which are extremely positive with Republicans), and he's even overall.",
      "His overall approval rating has ticked down just a point from last month and is a few points lower than at the start of his term, though it remains above what he got at any point during his first term.",
      "Trump's deportation program, specifically, retains majority approval. That hasn't really changed in recent weeks.",
      "As for some potential implications, as a general principle it's not acceptable to most if some legal U.S. residents were to be mistakenly detained by immigration authorities. But half of Republicans say it would be acceptable.",
      "Judges and the courts",
      "Americans overwhelmingly support the principle of judicial review of the legality of Mr. Trump's policies, including most Republicans. But there's also been calls from some to try to impeach federal judges who rule against Mr. Trump's policies, and that also finds favor with a majority of Republicans, especially those who identify as part of the MAGA movement.",
      "Federal workforce and DOGE",
      "Views on Mr. Trump's efforts to reduce the federal workforce are evenly split in the country.",
      "One reason is that most think the reductions will impact programs and services they care about. A slight majority still think Musk and DOGE have too much influence \u2014 with Republicans, again, standing differently than other Americans.",
      "On the matter of Trump administration officials discussing U.S. military plans on the Signal messaging app, most Americans, including most Republicans, say the matter is serious. And most don't think it was appropriate to use the app to discuss military plans.",
      "Democrats are more likely than Republicans to be following this story.",
      "So far, this situation isn't adversely affecting Republicans in their overall evaluation of Mr. Trump. An overwhelming majority of Republicans who describe what happened as very or somewhat serious still approve of him. Four in 10 Republicans do say what happened was appropriate.",

      "The Role of Congress",
      "Democrats increasingly call for their party in Congress to oppose Trump \u2014 these figures have risen with each poll.",

    "summary": "Protesters are trying to escalate a movement targeting Tesla dealerships and vehicles in opposition to Elon Musk's role in DOGE.",
    "story": [
      "Crowds protesting billionaire Elon Musk's purge of the U.S. government under President Trump began amassing outside Tesla dealerships throughout the U.S. and in some cities in Europe on Saturday in the latest attempt to dent the fortune of the world's richest man.",
      "The protesters are trying to escalate a movement targeting Tesla dealerships and vehicles in opposition to Musk's role as the head of the newly created Department of of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, where he's gained access to sensitive data and shuttered entire agencies as he attempts to slash government spending. Most of Musk's estimated $340 billion fortune consists of the stock he holds in the electric vehicle company that he continues to run while also working alongside Mr. Trump.",
      "Earlier protests have been somewhat sporadic. Saturday marked the first attempt to surround all 277 of the automaker's showrooms and service centers in the U.S. in hopes of deepening\u00a0a recent decline in the company's sales.",
      "By early afternoon, crowds ranging from a few dozen to hundreds of protesters had flocked to Tesla locations in New Jersey, Massachusetts, Connecticut, New York, Maryland, Minnesota and the automaker's home state of Texas. Pictures posted on social media accounts showed protesters brandishing signs such as\u00a0\"Honk if you hate Elon\"\u00a0and\u00a0\"Fight the billionaire broligarchy.\"",
      "The Tesla Takedown movement also hoped to rally protestors at more than 230 Tesla locations in other parts of the world. Although the turnouts in Europe weren't as large as the crowds in the U.S., the anti-Musk sentiment was similar.",
      "About two dozen protesters held signs lambasting Musk outside a Tesla dealership in London as passing cars and trucks tooted horns in support.",
      "One of the signs displayed at the London protest showed a photo of Musk next to an image of Adolf Hitler making the Nazi salute \u2014 a\u00a0gesture that Musk has been accused of reprising shortly after Mr. Trump's Jan. 20 inauguration. A person in a tyrannosaurus rex costume held another sign with a picture of Musk's straight-arm gesture that said, \"You thought the Nazis were extinct. Don't buy a Swasticar.\"",
      "\"We just want to get loud, make noise, make people aware of the problems that we're facing,\" said Cam Whitten, an American who showed up at the London protest.",
      "Tesla Takedown was organized by a group of supporters that included disillusioned owners of the automaker's vehicles, celebrities such as actor John Cusack, and at least one Democratic Party lawmaker, Rep. Jasmine Crockett from Dallas.",
      "\"I'm going to keep screaming in the halls of Congress. I just need you all to make sure you all keep screaming in the streets,\" Crockett said during a\u00a0Tesla Takedown organizing call\u00a0held earlier this month.",
      "In New York City, mayoral hopeful and New York state Rep. Zohran Mamdani joined protesters at a Tesla showroom on Saturday.",
      "\"We are here in a moment that demands all of us,\" Mandani told the crowd through a megaphone. \"It demands all of us because the richest man in the world has purchased the president of the United States.\"",
      "Some people opposed to Musk have gone beyond protests and set the automaker's vehicles on fire and committed\u00a0other acts of vandalism that U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi has decried as \"nothing short of domestic terrorism.\" Musk indicated he was dumbfounded by the attacks during a March 20 company meeting and said the vandals should \"stop acting psycho.\"",
      "Crockett and other Tesla Takedown supporters have been stressing the importance for Saturday's protests to remain peaceful.",
      "But police were investigating a fire that destroyed seven Tesla vehicles in northwestern Germany early Saturday morning. It was wasn't immediately clear if the blaze, which was extinguished by firefighters, was related to the Tesla Takedown protests.",
      "There have been vandalisms at Tesla dealerships acrossing the U.S., including fires in Nevada and Missouri, and graffiti at locations in Massachusetts and Maryland, CBS News previously reported.",
      "Since January 2025, incidents targeting Tesla EVs have occurred in at least nine states, according to a joint intelligence bulletin issued by the Department of Homeland Security and FBI and obtained by CBS News.\u00a0Although U.S. intelligence suggests lone actors are behind them, Trump administration officials are promising to crack down on what they say are coordinated attacks.",
      "There have also been reports of vandalism to parked Teslas, making individual owners nervous.",
      "\"My wife cautions me, 'Be careful where you are at with it,'\" Bill Fonte told CBS New York. \"If you don't like the product, don't buy it. But they're going above and beyond, creating panic and concern for normal people like me.\"",
      "A growing number of consumers who bought Tesla vehicles before Musk took over DOGE have been looking to sell or trade in their cars while others have slapped on bumper stickers seeking to distance themselves from the billionaire's efforts to prune or shut down government agencies.",
      "But Musk didn't appear concerned about an extended slump in sales of new Tesla cars in his March 20 address to employees. He reassured the workers that the company's Model Y, which is undergoing a refresh, would remain \"the best-selling car on Earth again this year.\" He also predicted Tesla will have sold more than 10 million cars worldwide by next year, up from about 7 million cars now.",
      "\"There are times when there are rocky moments, where there is stormy weather, but what I am here to tell you is that the future is incredibly bright and exciting,\" Musk said.",
      "After Mr. Trump was elected last November, investors initially saw Musk's alliance with the president as a positive development for Tesla and its long-running efforts to launch\u00a0a network of self-driving cars.",
      "That optimism helped lift Tesla's stock by 70% in the period between Mr. Trump's Nov. 5 election and his Jan. 20 inauguration, creating an additional $560 billion in shareholder wealth. But virtually all those gains have evaporated amid investor worries about the Tesla backlash, lagging sales in the U.S., Europe and China, and Musk spending time overseeing DOGE.",
      "\"This continues to be a moment of truth for Musk to navigate this brand tornado crisis moment and get onto the other side of this dark chapter for Tesla,\" Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives said in a research note leading up to Saturday's protests.",

    "story": [
      "U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson issued a preliminary injunction Friday that blocks the Trump administration from dismantling the Consumer Protection Financial Bureau.",
      "\"The court cannot look away or the CFPB will be dissolved and dismantled completely in approximately thirty days, well before this lawsuit has come to its conclusion,\" she wrote in a 112-page decision.",
      "Her order keeps the CFPB in existence until the case has been resolved on the merits. It also reinstates the agency's contracts, workforce, data and operational capacity.",
      "Jackson ruled that, without a court order, President Trump's administration would move quickly to shut down the agency that Congress created in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis.",
      "\"If the defendants are not enjoined, they will eliminate the agency before the Court has the opportunity to decide whether the law permits them to do it, and as the defendants' own witness warned, the harm will be irreparable,\" Berman Jackson said in her order.",
      "During a March 10 hearing, Jackson heard testimony about the chaos that erupted inside the agency after government employees were ordered to stop working last month. The bureau's chief operating officer, Adam Martinez, said the agency was in \"wind-down mode\" after Trump fired its previous director, Rohit Chopra, on Feb. 1.",
      "Trump installed a temporary replacement who ordered the immediate suspension of all agency operations, cancelled $100 million in contracts and fired 70 employees.",
      "Martinez said the agency's current leaders have adopted a more methodical approach than they initially did last month, when representatives of Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency arrived at its Washington headquarters.",
      "CFPB is responsible for protecting consumers from financial fraud and deceptive practices. It processes consumer complaints and examines banks to protect student loan borrowers.",
      "The National Treasury Employees Union, which represents more than 1,000 workers at the bureau, sued on Feb. 9 to block mass firings. Plaintiffs' attorneys argue that the administration doesn't have the constitutional authority to eliminate an agency that Congress created by statute.",
      "\"The defendants' unlawful action will have immediate consequences for the Americans that the CFPB was designed by Congress to protect,\"\u00a0the lawyers wrote.",
      "Government lawyers have said the plaintiffs are seeking to impermissibly place the CFPB in a \"judicially managed receivership,\" with the court overseeing its day-to-day operations.",
      "Jackson started her 112-page ruling by quoting Mr. Trump and his allies' own words about the bureau. Trump's billionaire adviser, Elon Musk, posted \"CFPB RIP\" on X, his social media platform, and added an emoji of a tombstone.

      "Mr. Trump has delayed 25% tariffs on Canadian and Mexican imports until April 2, but economists say the import duties could have detrimental effects on their economies given their deep reliance on the U.S. The drop in airline demand reflects \"a degradation of travel demand between the two countries, especially coming from the Canadian side,\" Scott Keyes, founder of Going.com, a flight deals website, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "As Mr. Trump promotes an \"America First\" trade policy, Canadians are similarly focusing on spending their dollars domestically, following former Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's please last month for residents to \"choose Canada,\" former Canadian Member of Parliament Dr. Ruby Dhalla told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"Instead of traveling to the U.S., we are seeing families travel visiting cities, towns and villages and exploring Canada's history and heritage,\" Dhalla said.",

      "\"For those that are still planning to travel there may be some airlines offering particularly cheap airfares over the next few months as they seek to stimulate demand but for the airlines it will be a nervous few months, especially as the traditional 'snowbird' market from Canada to the U.S. could be badly impacted next year if the situation doesn't improve quickly,\" the report states.",
      "Slashing routes to the U.S.",
      "Canadian airlines are expected to be hit harder than their American counterparts because the nation's residents are driving the downward trend, experts say. Americans typically prefer to fly American airlines because they might have loyalty accounts with a carrier, for example.",
      "Flair Airlines, a budget airline based in Canada, said last week it is cutting flights from Toronto to Nashville, as well as from Calgary to Las Vegas and Edmonton to Las Vegas.",
      "\"These are thee types of routes they are not confident in being able to sell at a rate that would make it profitable, so they are re-allocating some of the lax capacity elsewhere,\" Keyes said.",

      "Stocks are taking a battering on Friday amid growing concerns on Wall Street about the impact of President Trump's tariff regime as well as hotter-than-expected price data, sparking worries that the Federal Reserve is far from declaring victory on inflation.",
      "The Dow Jones Industrial Average tumbled 758 points, or 1.8%, to 41,541.09 in Friday afternoon trading, while the broad-based S&P 500 shed 2%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite index skidded 2.8%.",
      "Friday's stock market rout comes after Wall Street has already suffered a pummeling this year, with the S&P 500 down 9% from its most recent February high.",
      "Mr. Trump on Wednesday said he is imposing a\u00a025% tariff on all vehicles\u00a0and auto parts imported into the U.S., a move that is expected to add thousands of dollars to the cost of many vehicles. He also plans to announce more tariffs on April 2. Because tariffs are import taxes that companies largely pass onto consumers, many economists are forecasting an uptick in inflation later this year.",
      "At the same time, new economic data released on Friday shows that core inflation heated up last month, posing a challenge to the Federal Reserve's goal of driving inflation down to a 2% annual rate.",
      "\"The recent U.S. stock market correction appears to have been partially triggered by investors realising that Trump may follow through with his tariff threats and that this will hurt the U.S. economy,\" said Oxford Economics lead economist Daniel Harenberg and senior economist Kiki Sondh in a Friday report. \"Similarly, consumer sentiment has weakened due to tariff-induced inflation fears.\"",
      "The economy has so far been holding up relatively well, but if it were to weaken while inflation stays high, it would produce a worst-case scenario called \"stagflation,\" which policymakers in Washington have few good tools to fix.",

Two out of three consumers surveyed by the University of Michigan expect unemployment to worsen in the year ahead. That's the the highest reading since 2009, and it raises worries about a job market that's been the linchpin keeping the U.S. economy solid.",
      "At the same time, recent CBS News polling shows that Americans have become more dour in their economic outlooks, with relatively more consumers bracing for a slowdown or\u00a0recession\u00a0over the next year.",

      "On Wall Street, Ford Motor fell 2.6%, and General Motors sank 1.7%. Even U.S. automakers selling vehicles in the country can feel the pain of such tariffs because their supply chains are spread throughout North America. Trump says he wants more manufacturing to take place within the United States.",
      "The rout also hit shares outside the auto industry, with investors concerned that Mr. Trump's trade war may cause U.S. households and businesses to freeze their spending. Even if the tariffs end up being less painful than feared, all the uncertainty may filter into changed behaviors that hurt the economy.",
      "Leading the market lower on Friday was Lululemon Athletica, which dropped 15%. Even though the seller of athletic apparel reported a stronger profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected, it warned that its revenue growth may slow this upcoming year as consumers grow more cautious.",
      "\"Consumers are spending less due to increased concerns about inflation and the economy,\" said CEO Calvin McDonald.",
      "Lululemon also said tariffs and shifting foreign-currency values may account for about half of its expected drop in a key measure of performance: how much profit it can squeeze out of each $1 of revenue.",

An optional add-on to potentially increase nonjackpot prizes for an additional dollar and a $3 feature for two plays for the jackpot will be discontinued.",
      "In exchange for the higher price, the game boasts better odds for winning. While the odds for winning any prize will improve from 1 in 24 to 1 in 23, the chances of winning the big prize will still be astronomical: going from 1 in 302,575,350 to 1 in 290,472,336.

      "The size of the prizes are also changing. The jackpot will be a minimum of $50 million, up from $20 million. Mega Millions estimates that the average jackpot win with the new changes will be over $800 million, an increase from about $450 million. A random multiplier will also be added to the smaller prizes.",

    "story": [
      "President Trump on Wednesday said he will put a 25% tariff on vehicles and auto parts imported into the\u00a0U.S., escalating his administration's use of aggressive trade measures in an effort to boost domestic manufacturers.",
      "\"This will continue to spur growth like you haven't seen before,\" Mr. Trump said from the Oval Office Wednesday afternoon. \"We'll effectively be charging a 25% tariff. But if you build your car in the United States, there is no tariff.\"",
      "Mr. Trump said the new auto tariffs will take effect on April 2 and that the U.S. would start collecting the duties the following day. The president added he believes the new import duty could raise between $600 billion and $1 trillion in revenue for the U.S. over the next two years.",
      "\"This number will be used to reduce debt greatly,\" Mr. Trump said. \"Basically I view it as reducing taxes and reducing debt.\"",
      "White House staff secretary Will Scharf, who stood next to Mr. Trump during the announcement, offered a more conservative estimate of how much the new auto tariffs would raise, predicting roughly $100 billion in new revenue.",
      "Mr. Trump also reiterated his goal of making interest paid on auto loans tax deductible, while noting that such a deduction would apply only to cars made in the U.S.",
      "Tax deductions are generally only employed by high-income Americans because most taxpayers take the standard deduction, which means tax-deductible auto loans wouldn't impact low- or middle-income households.",
      "Meanwhile, car prices are \"likely to rise significantly\" for consumers, according to Rella Suskin, equity analyst at Morningstar in a Thursday research note. Suskin added, \"Domestically produced vehicles are expected to gain market share, but very few, even from US-based manufacturers, are made with 100% U.S. content.\"",
      "Automaker shares take a hit",
      "The latest salvo of tariffs comes after Mr. Trump earlier this month gave a one-month exemption to U.S. automakers from the round of import duties that took effect on March 4.",
      "Because tariffs are taxes on imports that are largely passed onto U.S. consumers, they can cause households to cut back on spending and dampen economic growth, according to experts.",
      "Shares of the Big Three U.S. automakers \u2014 Ford, General Motors and Stellantis \u2014 all sank after Mr. Trump announced the new tariffs. In Thursday morning trading, Ford's shares slipped 38 cents, or 3.7% to $9.92, while GM tumbled 7.3%. Stellantis shed 2.6%.",
      "Tesla shares, which have slumped this year because of disappointing sales and\u00a0consumer unhappiness\u00a0over CEO Elon Musk's involvement with the Trump administration, rose $7.13, or 2.6%, to $279.19. Tesla manufactures its vehicles within the U.S., although Musk said on social media that the electric vehicle maker will still feel an impact. Some Tesla parts are imported from other countries.",
      "\"Important to note that Tesla is NOT unscathed here. The tariff impact on Tesla is still significant,\" Musk wrote on X.",
      "In a statement Wednesday night, Matt Blunt, president of the American Automotive Policy Council, a U.S. trade group that represents the Big Three, said that \"U.S. Automakers are committed to President Trump's vision of increasing automotive production and jobs in the U.S. and will continue to work with the Administration on durable policies that help Americans.\"",
      "Tesla warns that Trump's trade war could hurt U.S. automakers",
      "Tesla warns that Trump's trade war could hurt U.S. automakers",
      "Blunt added, \"In particular, it is critical that tariffs are implemented in a way that avoids raising prices for consumers and that preserves the competitiveness of the integrated North American automotive sector that has been a key success of the President's USMCA agreement.\"",
      "When reached for comment, Stellantis directed CBS News to the AAPC's statement.",
      "Mr. Trump has long said that tariffs on auto imports would be a\u00a0defining policy\u00a0of his presidency, betting that the costs created by the taxes would lead both American and foreign automakers to relocate production to U.S. soil.",
      "Automakers with U.S. plants still depend on Canada, Mexico and other nations for parts and finished vehicles. Because booting up manufacturing facilities would take time, in the medium term domestic auto prices would likely increase and car sales decline, experts say.",
      "Car prices could jump",
      "One analysis of Mr. Trump's tariffs estimated that auto prices could rise as much as\u00a0$12,200 for some models\u00a0due to the new import duties, according to a report from Anderson Economic Group, a Michigan-based economic consultancy.",
      "\"In the long-run, this could boost domestic investment and production. In the short-run, however, it will be inflationary and, assuming that domestic producers respond by substantially increasing their own prices, could make new vehicles something of a luxury item,\" Paul Ashworth, chief North America economist with Capital Economics, said in a report.",
      "Targeting imported cars also could strain ties with key trading U.S. partners including Canada, Japan, Mexico and South Korea, as well as Europe.",
      "\"I deeply regret the U.S. decision to impose tariffs on EU automotive exports,\" Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, said in a social media post. \"Tariffs are taxes \u2014 bad for businesses, worse for consumers in the U.S. and the EU. The EU will continue to seek negotiated solutions, while safeguarding its economic interests.\"",
      "About 50% of cars sold in the U.S. are manufactured within the country. Among imports, about half come from Mexico and Canada, with Japan, South Korea and Germany, also major suppliers.",
      "Other groups expressed support for the new auto tariffs.",
      "\"Auto production is the bedrock of a nation's manufacturing ecosystem,\" Scott Paul, president of the Alliance for American Manufacturing, an industry trade group, said in a statement posted social media. \"We've seen it eroded in the U.S. over the past four decades first by Asian imports then by NAFTA. A 25% tariff on auto imports isn't the only way to spur more auto plants here, but it is in my view necessary.\"",
      "Shawn Fain, president of United Auto Workers, said the tariffs could bolster job growth in the U.S. \"With these tariffs, thousands of good-paying blue-collar auto jobs could be brought back to working-class communities across the United States within a matter of months, simply by adding additional shifts or lines in a number of underutilized auto plants,\" he said.",

    "published": "Thu, 27 Mar 2025 09:53:55 -0400",
    "summary": "Starting today, the Social Security Administration will again take 100% of a beneficiary's check to recoup overpayments. Here's what to know.",
    "story": [
      "Some Social Security recipients could soon find themselves in the crosshairs of a policy that advocates for seniors say could cause financial hardship for many older Americans.",
      "Starting today, the Social Security Administration will begin clawing back overpayments from the retirement program by taking 100% of a beneficiary's monthly check until the money is repaid, up from the prior rate of 10%. The policy will impact new cases of overpayments starting on March 27. The benefits withholding rate for people who were overpaid before that date will remain at 10%.",
      "The agency's 100% recovery rate was announced earlier this month by SSA Acting Commissioner Lee Dudek, who has worked with Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, to cut costs at the agency by firing thousands of workers and closing field offices.",
      "Dudek has\u00a0described the 100% clawback rate as part of the agency's responsibility to recover overpaid funds. But advocates for older Americans say the policy will cause financial distress for many people, especially those who rely on the program for all or most of their income.",
      "\"If an overpayment is being made, that means the Social Security Administration is withholding 100% of their payment for however long it takes to repay the agency \u2014 and they are without money to pay for food\" or other living expenses, Dan Adcock, director of government relations and policy for the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare, an advocacy group, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "The clawback policy could prove especially hard on the 40% of Social Security beneficiaries who rely on the program for 90% of more of their income, he added.",
      "In many cases, Social Security overpayments are the fault of agency, with a\u00a02022 report\u00a0by its inspector general finding that about 73,000 overpayments that year were due to a lack of \"effective controls over benefit-computation accuracy.\"",
      "Under the Biden administration, the Social Security Administration in 2024\u00a0capped the clawback rate at 10%, stepping back from its prior 100% level following reports that the higher rate had pushed some Americans into financial hardship and even\u00a0homelessness.",
      "\"The thing is, this administration has said, 'We're going back to the old way, we're getting 100% of the money back going forward,'\" CBS News business analyst Jill Schlesinger told CBS News.",
      "Can you avoid a Social Security overpayment?",
      "In some cases, overpayments are due to miscalculations on the part of the Social Security Administration, or because the agency doesn't update beneficiaries' records in a timely way. That can make it difficult for seniors to know if they're getting paid too much.",
      "But it's also important for beneficiaries to update the SSA with their latest information, such as increases in their income that can lead to overpayments. The importance of updating the agency about such changes may not be fully appreciated by some beneficiaries because of the complexity of the Social Security system, the agency's inspector general said in a 2024 report.",
      "\"We urge beneficiaries to keep a close eye on their benefits going forward,\" said Shannon Benton, executive director of The Senior Citizens League, an advocacy group for older Americans. \"If they notice any unscheduled changes to their benefits, they should contact Social Security immediately.\"",
      "It's important to keep records of your payments and flag any issues, such as if your check is larger than it previously was, Schlesinger said. \"Unfortunately the onus is on us\" to correct the record, she added.",
      "DOGE cuts, long waits",
      "Because of DOGE's job cuts at the Social Security Administration and the closure of agency field offices, it's recently become more difficult for seniors and other beneficiaries to contact the agency to report changes or ask for help, Adcock said.",
      "Those issues arose in a Tuesday Senate confirmation hearing for President Trump's nominee for Social Security commissioner, Frank Bisignano, who said that only about 46% of phone calls to the agency are answered \"because people get discouraged and hang up\" due to long wait times.",
      "Sen. Steve Daines, a Republican from Montana, told Bisignano that one of his staffers this week called the agency's 800 number to assess the level of customer service, but was disconnected three times, once after being on hold for an hour.",
      "\"We've got a lot of work to do to serve the taxpayers in this country,\" Daines said.",
      "Improvements to Social Security?",
      "In the hearing, Bisignano also said he wants to reduce what the agency calls \"improper payments,\" which include both overpayments and underpayments to beneficiaries. Currently, about 1% of Social Security's annual payments are improper, with Bisignano saying he believes that rate should be \"five decimal points to the right.\"",
      "Yet enhancing the accuracy of benefits will likely take a large investment in Social Security because it would require changes in systems, technology and other resources, Benton said.",
      "\"While improvements are possible, achieving such a low error rate is challenging due to the complexity of Social Security benefits and past challenges with fraud and reporting errors,\" she said. \"Some progress is likely and will probably be incremental, but a significant reduction over the next four years will be extremely challenging.\"",
      "In the meantime, seniors and other Social Security recipients should watch their benefits closely and report changes in their income to the agency. And if people receives a beneficiary letter from the agency, they can also request a waiver, which can be made through\u00a0SSA form 632.",
      "\"While we believe that overpayments should be recouped, we believe it's essential that beneficiaries have time to plan, and not face undue pressure from an almost immediate 100% reduction in benefits,\" Benton said.",

      "\"The Congressional Budget Office estimates that if the debt limit remains unchanged, the government's ability to borrow using extraordinary measures will probably be exhausted in August or September 2025,\" the nonpartisan budget office said Wednesday.",
      "The so-called \"X-date\" marks when the government could run out of borrowing power and face an unprecedented default without action from Congress to address the debt limit, which caps how much the Treasury can borrow to pay the government's obligations. The department is currently utilizing so-called \"extraordinary measures\" to delay a default for several months.",
      "The CBO analysis noted that if the government's borrowing needs are \"significantly greater\" than projections, the Treasury Department's resources could be exhausted as early as late May or June.",
      "The debt ceiling was last addressed in 2023, when Congress suspended it until Jan. 1, 2025, under the Fiscal Responsibility Act. Since January, the Treasury Department has been using \"extraordinary measures\" to pay its bills and extend the date when it will run out of money. Raising the debt limit doesn't greenlight new spending, but allows the government to pay what it already owes. The U.S. national debt currently stands at more than $36 trillion.",
      "The CBO estimate came after the Bipartisan Policy Center projected on Monday that the U.S. could default on its debt between July and October without congressional intervention. The Treasury Department is also expected to release a projected X-date in the coming weeks.",
      "Meanwhile, congressional leaders have weighed how to address the issue. Last month, the House included a provision that would raise the debt ceiling by $4 trillion in its budget proposal, which serves as a blueprint for implementing President Trump's agenda. But the Senate has been pursuing a different budget measure that does not include a debt limit increase.",
      "In recent days, Republicans in Congress have been working to reconcile the two approaches as they look to make headway on the complicated process to implement the president's agenda. House Speaker Mike Johnson and Senate Majority Leader John Thune met Tuesday afternoon with top tax leaders as they work to unite behind a plan on the path forward. And Thune told reporters he's hopeful lawmakers will be able to address the debt limit as part of the budget process.",

    "published": "Mon, 31 Mar 2025 19:17:00 -0400",
    "summary": "President Donald Trump again suggested he may try to run for a third term in office, despite limits set by the 12th and 22nd Amendments.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump has periodically floated the idea of serving a third term in office since his first reelection campaign and seemed to double down on it Sunday during an interview with NBC News, suggesting \"there are methods\" to do it despite term limits set by the 12th and 22nd Amendments in the U.S. Constitution.",
      "To date, Franklin D. Roosevelt is the only president in the history of the United States to serve more than two terms, ultimately sitting in office from 1933 to 1945, when he died shortly after beginning his fourth term. His third term was controversial, said Noah Rosenblum, a legal historian and constitutional law professor at New York University, noting that FDR's tenure broke from a precedent set by George Washington and drew accusations of dictatorial ambitions as well as a disrespect for democracy.",
      "\"There are very few norms as deeply embedded in American democratic culture as the idea that the president serves two terms,\" Rosenblum told CBS News. \"And clever word games to try to get around that are really nothing but attempts to undermine the clear text, spirit and intention of the Constitution and this historical process that ungirds it.\"",
      "Here's what to know about the amendments that regulate how long any one person can remain president.",
      "What is Trump saying about seeking a third term?",
      "Mr. Trump has mentioned staying in office after his current, second term ends on numerous occasions, stretching back to his first administration. On the campaign trail in 2020, he told attendees at a rally in Minden, Nevada, that he believed he would win that year's election against Joe Biden and went on to suggest he could take the White House for a third time afterward.",
      "\"We're going to win four more years in the White House. And then after that, we'll negotiate, right?\" Mr. Trump said at the time. \"Because we're probably, based on the way we were treated, we're probably entitled to another four after that.\" It was unclear at the time if Mr. Trump meant what he said, but the comments stoked national discourse about whether he would, or could, truly attempt to flout the two-term limit.",
      "Those questions began to crop up again after the president's recent remarks to NBC News, in which he said during a phone interview from Mar-a-Lago that he was \"not joking\" about trying to serve a third term in the White House.",
      "\"There are methods which you could do it,\" said Mr. Trump, although he added, \"It is far too early to think about it.\"",
      "When asked by NBC's Kristen Welker about a hypothetical scenario where Vice President JD Vance won the next election and handed the authority back to him, he said that could be one way to end up in office for a third time.",
      "\"But there are others, too. There are others,\" Mr. Trump continued, declining to elaborate when asked.",
      "What does the 22nd Amendment say, exactly?",
      "The opening line of the 22nd Amendment to the Constitution states: \"No person shall be elected to the office of the President more than twice, and no person who has held the office of President, or acted as President, for more than two years of a term to which some other person was elected President shall be elected to the office of the President more than once.\"",
      "The latter portion of that section means that if the vice president takes over the presidency if an elected president dies, for example, and serves in that role for more than half of the originally elected president's term, then they could only serve one more presidential term after that. The former restricts an individual to two four-year terms of service as president, applying to consecutive and non-consecutive terms.",
      "Addressing remarks by some, like constitutional law scholar Lawrence Tribe, who has observed that the amendment as written merely prevents a sitting president from being elected, but not serving, more than twice, Rosenblum said the language \"reinforces the intention of the amendment, which is not to prevent someone from being elected president twice, it's to make sure nobody serves more than two terms as president.\"",
      "\"The language of the 22nd Amendment is framed in terms of the language of 'election,' but the purpose of the amendment is clear,\" Rosenblum told CBS News. \"It's to ensure that the office of the president transfers and cycles as part of the democratic process.\"",
      "Why was the 22nd Amendment ratified?",
      "Congress proposed the 22nd Amendment in 1947 in response to critiques of FDR's presidency, which ended with Roosevelt's death in April 1945, a few months into his fourth term.",
      "The National Constitution Center notes that Republicans who had long opposed FDR found allies among some Democrats from the South and West to get the proposal passed through Congress and sent to the states for ratification. The 22nd Amendment was ratified in 1951.",
      "Harry Truman, who was Roosevelt's vice president, stepped in as president in 1945 and was subsequently elected to fulfill another term in office when that one concluded. Truman opted not to run again in 1952.",
      "What about the 12th Amendment?",
      "The 12th Amendment preceded the 22nd by well over a century but even then it included a provision about who is and is not eligible to run for president and vice president. This amendment was introduced by federal legislators in 1803 and ratified about six months later, in 1804, taking effect in time for the year's presidential election that saw Thomas Jefferson assume office.",
      "It primarily focuses on the processes through which the Electoral College votes to elect a U.S. president and vice president,\u00a0the National Constitution Center writes. However, the amendment also states that \"no person constitutionally ineligible to the office of President shall be eligible to that of Vice-President of the United States.\"",
      "That would mean Mr. Trump could not run for vice president on the ticket of another presidential candidate after finishing his second term in office if the 22nd Amendment's provisions prevent him from running for president.",
      "Is there a way Trump could serve a third term?",
      "Rosenblum said Mr. Trump's ability to serve a third term could come down to how the courts interpret the 12th and 22nd Amendments. He pointed out that even those committed to more literal application of the Constitution tend to interpret the language \"with an eye toward what the real purpose is.\"",
      "In this case, he said, that would be upholding the term limits it has laid out. Still, Rosenblum cautioned, \"a president who's interested in remaining in power, despite limits against it, will come up with clever legal arguments to do so.\"",
      "\"This is an administration that has repeatedly shown itself contemptuous of the rule of law,\" said Rosenblum. \"So, will Trump be able to violate the law and remain in office indefinitely? Only if the American people let him.\"",
      "Asked about Mr. Trump's comments and whether the president could get a third term, Senate Majority Leader John Thune said, \"Not without a change in the Constitution.\"",
      "He added, \"I think that you guys [reporters] keep asking the question and \u2026 I think he is having some fun with it, probably messing with you.\"",
      "Other legal scholars who have weighed in on the subject say they doubt Mr. Trump could manage to usurp the amendments and their long-held rules of law.",
      "\"I don't think there's any 'one weird trick' to getting around presidential term limits,\" Derek Muller, a professor of election law at Notre Dame, told the Associated Press.",
      "Muller suggested Mr. Trump has mentioned running for a third term \"to show as much strength as possible,\" adding that \"a lame-duck president like Donald Trump has every incentive in the world to make it seem like he's not a lame duck.\"",
      "All told, the question of Mr. Trump continuing as president past January 2029 is \"incredibly complicated,\" said Michael Dorf, a constitutional law scholar and Cornell University professor whose blog series, \"Wait, Can He Actually Do That?,\" analyzes the latest actions by the administration when one \"seemingly exceeds the president's authority.\"",
      "Dorf has identified two main reasons for the complexity.",
      "\"One, is that our system for electing presidents is complicated, even in normal times,\" he told CBS News. \"But it's also complicated because, ultimately, no legal system can work if people are acting in constant bad faith. There has to be some sort of willingness of people to accept defeat, or to give the law a sensible meaning. And Trump has shown repeatedly that if it disfavors him, he's going to ignore longstanding norms.\"",

      "\"We're probably entitled to another four after that\"",
      "Mr. Trump flirted with additional time in office beyond two terms when he sought reelection in 2020. During a rally in Minden, Nevada, the president predicted he would win four more years in the White House, and even suggested that he could go on to another term after his second.",
      "\"We're going to win four more years in the White House. And then after that, we'll negotiate, right?\" Mr. Trump said. \"Because we're probably, based on the way we were treated, we're probably entitled to another four after that.\"",
      "\"Am I allowed to run again?\"",
      "Shortly after returning to office, Mr. Trump again made reference to another term at a rally in Las Vegas on Jan. 25.",
      "\"It will be the greatest honor of my life to serve, not once but twice \u2014 or three times or four times,\" Mr. Trump quipped to applause from the crowd, before adding that \"no, it will be to serve twice.\"",
      "Then on Jan. 27, Mr. Trump joked to Republican lawmakers about a third term. Speaking before the House GOP conference in Florida, Mr. Trump touted the money he'd raised for another race that he said \"I assume I can't use for myself.\"",
      "\"But I'm not 100% sure because, I don't know,\" the president continued, to laughter from House Republicans. \"I think I'm not allowed to run again. I'm not sure. Am I allowed to run again?\"",
      "\"Should I run again? You tell me.\"",
      "At the National Prayer Breakfast on Feb. 6, Mr. Trump said, \"They say I can't run again \u2014 that's the expression.\"",
      "\"Then somebody said, 'I don't think you can.' Oh,\" the president added.",
      "On Feb. 20, the president again joked about an additional term at a White House event to mark Black History Month, as he celebrated the support he saw from Black Americans in the 2024 election.",
      "\"Should I run again? You tell me,\" Mr. Trump said, as supporters chanted, \"four more years!\"",
      "\"There are methods\"",
      "In an interview with NBC's Kristen Welker on March 30, Mr. Trump said, \"I'm not joking\" about serving a third term, and for the first time mentioned an awareness of potential paths.",

      "\"A lame-duck president like Donald Trump has every incentive in the world to make it seem like he's not a lame duck,\" he said.",
      "Mr. Trump, who would be 82 at the end of his second term, was asked whether he would want to keep serving in \"the toughest job in the country\" at that point.",

      "Mr. Trump suggested that Americans would go along with a third term because of his popularity. He falsely claimed to have \"the highest poll numbers of any Republican for the last 100 years.\"",
      "Gallup data shows President George W. Bush reaching a 90% approval rating after the attacks on Sept. 11, 2001. His father, President George H.W. Bush, hit 89% following the Gulf War in 1991.",

      "In January, just before Mr. Trump took office, four in 10 felt his policies as president would make them financially better off.",
      "But as of the end of March, only a quarter of Americans still feel that way, with nearly twice as many saying Mr. Trump's policies are negatively impacting their finances.",

    "story": [
      "MINNEAPOLIS \u2014\u00a0Minnesota Lt. Gov. Peggy Flanagan officially launched her campaign for U.S. Senate on Thursday, a week after saying she would run following Sen. Tina Smith's declaration she would not seek reelection next year.",
      "\"In Ojibwe, my name means 'speaks in a loud and clear voice woman.' Today, I'm officially launching my campaign for the U.S. Senate to go to D.C. and speak in a loud and clear voice for all of Minnesota,\" Flanagan wrote on social media. \"Throughout my career, I've worked to live up to my name. On the school board, in the state house, and as lieutenant governor, I've fought for kitchen-table issues that impact children and families.\"",
      "Flanagan's initial announcement also came via social media.",
      "\"I love Minnesota and my intention is to run for United States Senate and continue to serve the people of this state,\" Flanagan said. \"I'll make a formal announcement later this month. In the meantime, I'm talking with community and my family and friends. I will have more to say soon.\"",
      "Flanagan is the country's highest ranking Native woman elected to executive office. A member of the White Earth Band of Ojibwe, she would have become the first Native American woman to become a U.S. governor if the Kamala Harris-Tim Walz ticket won in the presidential election.",
      "After a stint serving on the Minneapolis Board of Education, Flanagan started working for the progressive group Wellstone Action, training organizers, elected officials and candidates with dreams of taking office. She even trained Walz, who before his political career was a high school social studies teacher.",
      "When Walz made his first gubernatorial run in 2018, he tapped Flanagan, who gave his candidacy a liberal tilt.",
      "Since taking office, Flanagan helped establish the country's first\u00a0Missing and Murdered Indigenous Relatives Office\u00a0and has worked to make childcare and\u00a0housing\u00a0more affordable. She is a vocal supporter of abortion rights.",
      "Flanagan shouldered more responsibility as Walz hit the campaign trail last fall.\u00a0In a recent interview with WCCO, Walz praised Flanagan for her work as second-in-command but did not confirm if she would be joining him if he were to run for a third term.",
      "\"Lt. Gov. Flanagan has been a voice for children. She has been a voice to make sure our communities are represented. She's been a voice on looking to make sure our tribal communities are listened to,\" Walz said. \"I think she \u2014 she and I together \u2014 have been highly successful, and when we get to that bridge, we'll cross it.\"",
      "After Smith made her announcement, Flanagan released a statement saying that the senator \"has paved the way for so many women like me throughout her entire career.\"",
      "\"She uses her voice to fiercely defend the people of Minnesota. She's fought for small businesses, farmers, and those who've been overlooked so they can have a fair shot at economic success. Senator Smith is also an organizer at heart. She knows we all do better when everyone has a seat at the table. Thank you, Tina, for your leadership. I look forward to continuing our work together for Minnesotans,\" she added.",
      "Smith said her decision was \"not political\" but instead \"entirely personal.\" Minnesota has not had a Republican senator since Norm Coleman narrowly lost a reelection campaign to the DFL's Al Franken in 2008.",
      "Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison endorsed Flanagan in late March, saying \"we need leaders in Washington who have the guts to stand up and fight for us, my friend Peggy Flanagan has never backed down from a fight.\"",

      "Iran President Masoud Pezeshkian said Sunday that the Islamic Republic rejected direct negotiations with the United States in response to a letter President Trump sent earlier this month over the country's rapidly advancing nuclear program. It was Tehran's first official response to Mr. Trump's letter.",
      "\"Although the possibility of direct negotiations between the two sides has been rejected in this response, it has been emphasized that the path for indirect negotiations remains open,\" Pezeshkian said, adding Iran's response was delivered via the sultanate of Oman.",

      "The White House offered no immediate reaction to the announcement.",
      "Mr. Trump revealed in an interview with Fox News Channel's \"Sunday Morning Futures\" earlier this month that he had sent a letter to Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei urging him to negotiate and warning of potential military action if it refused.",
      "\"I would rather negotiate a deal. I'm not sure that everybody agrees with me, but we can make a deal that would be just as good as if you won militarily,\" Mr. Trump said. \"But the time is happening now. The time is coming up. Something's going to happen one way or the other. I hope that Iran \u2014 and I've written him a letter, saying, 'I hope you're going to negotiate.' Because if we have to go in militarily, it's going to be a terrible thing \u2014 for them.\"",
      "On Sunday, in an interview with NBC News taped before Pezeshkian's comments, Mr. Trump reiterated that he is considering military action and secondary tariffs if Iran does not agree to a nuclear deal.",
      "\"If they don't make a deal, there will be bombing and it will be bombing the likes of which they have never seen before,\" he said.",
      "Mr. Trump's overture comes as both Israel and the U.S. have warned they will never let Iran acquire a nuclear weapon, leading to fears of a military confrontation as Tehran enriches uranium at near weapons-grade levels \u2013 something only done by atomic-armed nations.",
      "Iran has long maintained its program is for peaceful purposes, even as its officials increasingly threaten to pursue the bomb as tensions are high with the U.S. over its sanctions and after the collapse of a ceasefire in Israel's\u00a0war against Hamas in the Gaza Strip.",
      "As the U.S. conducts intense airstrikes targeting the Iranian-backed Houthi rebels of Yemen, the risk of military action targeting Iran's nuclear program remains on the table.",
      "A\u00a0report last month\u00a0by the United Nations nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency, said Iran had \"significantly increased production and accumulation of high enriched uranium.\"",
      "Last week, Khamenei warned that U.S. threats against his country \"will get them nowhere,\" adding that Americans \"and others should know that if they do anything malign to the Iranian nation, they will get a hard slap.\"",

      "Mr. Trump's first term in office was marked by a particularly troubled period in relations with Tehran. In 2018, he unilaterally withdrew the United States from Iran's nuclear deal with world powers, leading to sanctions hobbling Iran's economy. Iran retaliated with attacks at sea \u2014 including one that it likely carried out and that temporarily halved Saudi Arabia's oil production.",

      "This has Americans collectively skeptical right now about the ability of Mr. Trump's policies to make them financially better off, a sentiment that was key to the success of his 2024 campaign.",
      "Yet that's balanced out for Mr. Trump today by continued majority approval on immigration and on his deportation program, specifically. That comes especially \u2014 but not exclusively \u2014 from his Republican base, many of whom say that's just as important as the economy in their evaluations.",
      "Meanwhile, the public continues to weigh the changes brought by the federal workforce reductions, with many believing they will impact programs they care about.",
      "But the matter involving administration officials' use of the Signal app, while seen as serious, does not seem tied to evaluations of Mr. Trump overall.",
      "From a list of items, most say the administration is focused too much on tariffs, and by contrast, is not focused enough on lowering prices.",
      "Donald Trump won the 2024 election in large part on the economy and the idea that he'd make Americans financially better off.",
      "Just before he took office, a sizable four in 10 felt his policies as president would do just that.",

      "Even among Republicans, things have tempered. Just before he took office, three-fourths of Republicans said Mr. Trump's policies as president would make them better off, and now, under half of them say that's what is happening so far.",
      "Tariffs, or the threat of them, don't seem to be helping.",
      "Most oppose new tariffs, as they have for a while, and big numbers think that'll lead to higher prices in the short term.",
      "The administration has argued that tariffs will have long-term benefits, but people are more inclined to think they'll raise prices rather than lower them in the long term, too. Tariffs on imported cars in particular aren't popular, either.",
      "(Prices, of course, have been a key concern for years. They are the number one reason that people still rate the economy badly,\u00a0according to recent polling.)",
      "Importantly, though, Mr. Trump doesn't fully \"own\" the issue. Joe Biden still gets a little more blame for today's inflation rate than Mr. Trump does.",
      "Mr. Trump's approval for handling inflation specifically remains negative, and his rating on handling the economy in general has edged into negative territory since last month.",
      "That balances against net-positive ratings for immigration (which are extremely positive with Republicans), and he's even overall.",
      "His overall approval rating has ticked down just a point from last month and is a few points lower than at the start of his term, though it remains above what he got at any point during his first term.",
      "Trump's deportation program, specifically, retains majority approval. That hasn't really changed in recent weeks.",
      "As for some potential implications, as a general principle it's not acceptable to most if some legal U.S. residents were to be mistakenly detained by immigration authorities. But half of Republicans say it would be acceptable.",
      "Judges and the courts",
      "Americans overwhelmingly support the principle of judicial review of the legality of Mr. Trump's policies, including most Republicans. But there's also been calls from some to try to impeach federal judges who rule against Mr. Trump's policies, and that also finds favor with a majority of Republicans, especially those who identify as part of the MAGA movement.",
      "Federal workforce and DOGE",
      "Views on Mr. Trump's efforts to reduce the federal workforce are evenly split in the country.",
      "One reason is that most think the reductions will impact programs and services they care about. A slight majority still think Musk and DOGE have too much influence \u2014 with Republicans, again, standing differently than other Americans.",
      "On the matter of Trump administration officials discussing U.S. military plans on the Signal messaging app, most Americans, including most Republicans, say the matter is serious. And most don't think it was appropriate to use the app to discuss military plans.",
      "Democrats are more likely than Republicans to be following this story.",
      "So far, this situation isn't adversely affecting Republicans in their overall evaluation of Mr. Trump. An overwhelming majority of Republicans who describe what happened as very or somewhat serious still approve of him. Four in 10 Republicans do say what happened was appropriate.",
      "And most Americans would not approve of Donald Trump having the U.S. take control of Greenland.",
      "The Role of Congress",
      "Democrats increasingly call for their party in Congress to oppose Trump \u2014 these figures have risen with each poll.",

      "Washington \u2014 The Trump administration's crackdown on students who participated in pro-Palestinian activities has\u00a0raised questions about the First Amendment rights of visa and green card holders amid the shocking detentions of a number of students at Tufts, Columbia and other universities in recent weeks.",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio cited a provision in the Immigration and Nationality Act that authorizes the nation's top diplomat to revoke the visas of foreign national students on the grounds that their presence or activities have \"potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences\" for the U.S.",
      "The federal government is not required to lay out proof beyond that explanation, legal experts told CBS News, setting up a legal showdown over foreign nationals' free speech rights in the U.S.",
      "\"There's a tension between everyone's First Amendment rights to free speech and the immigration statute's broad provisions giving the secretary of state broad latitude to declare someone deportable simply because he thinks that the student may have potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences. And the courts will have to figure out where the appropriate line should be drawn,\" said Stephen Yale-Loehr, a retired immigration law professor at Cornell University.",
      "Rubio said Thursday the State Department has canceled more than 300 visas and that they're \"primarily\" student visas. Several high-profile cases are related to students who led or participated in pro-Palestinian activities and disruptive protests, which the administration has equated to activity supporting Hamas, a U.S.-designated terrorist group.",
      "He also told reporters that if the administration is compelled to provide evidence in court, it will, but said \"judges don't issue student visas. There's no right to a student visa.\"",
      "\"We gave you a visa to come and study and get a degree, not to become a social activist that tears up our university campuses. And if we've given you a visa, and then you decide to do that, we're going to take it away,\" Rubio said at a news conference in Guyana.",
      "In targeting students, the Trump administration is enforcing the statute differently than past administrations, according to immigration lawyer Jonathan Grode.",
      "\"This administration hasn't changed the law,\" Grode said. \"They're just telling the referees to call the game differently. They're saying, be stricter, use all the tools you have available to effectuate this behavior. That's the big difference. That's why it feels so jarring.\"",
      "\"With the Trump administration, they're pushing this to such a degree that it's creating concern, hysteria, reaction, litigation,\" he added.",
      "A visa revocation does not automatically result in a person's deportation, which is handled by the Department of Homeland Security and requires due process. Several of the students are sitting in detention facilities as the government seeks to deport them.",
      "Rubio's remarks came in response to a question about Tufts University graduate student Rumeysa Ozturk, a Fulbright scholar and Turkish national who was taken into custody by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents wearing masks and in plain clothes in Massachusetts on Tuesday, March 25.",
      "A Department of Homeland Security spokesperson alleged Wednesday that Ozturk had \"engaged in activities in support of Hamas,\" but did not provide details about her alleged activities. Ozturk's friends have said she is being punished for co-authoring an opinion piece in the Tufts Daily campus newspaper in 2024, where she called on the school to divest from Israel and \"acknowledge the Palestinian genocide\" but never mentioned Hamas.",
      "The case followed another high-profile detention earlier this month of Mahmoud Khalil, a Columbia University grad student who had been active in pro-Palestinian protests on campus last year. Khalil, who was born in a Palestinian refugee camp in Syria, has a green card, or legal permanent residency, and his wife is an American citizen. Immigration authorities initially told Khalil that they were acting on a State Department order to revoke his student visa, but when they were informed that he had a green card, the agent said they were revoking that according to his attorney.",
      "Green cards, however, cannot be rescinded as simply as visas. The government suggested in a court filing earlier this week that it could move to revoke his status for allegedly omitting information on his immigration forms, including his involvement with the United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees, known as UNRWA, and a group known as Columbia University Apartheid Divest.",
      "But at the core of the U.S. government's detention and aimed deportation of Khalil is a rarely used section of the Immigration and Nationality Act that subjects noncitizens to possible deportation if their presence and activities are deemed threatening to the foreign policy interests of the U.S.",
      "This same law was used to detain Georgetown University researcher Badar Khan Suri, an Indian national who was taken into custody by masked agents March 17 in Virginia. The government cited his alleged \"close connections\" to a Hamas official as justification for revoking the visa, saying he was \"actively spreading Hamas propaganda.\"",
      "The government using that law is also trying to deport Yunseo Chung, a 21-year-old Columbia University student and legal permanent resident who has been involved in pro-Palestinian protests. Chung came to the U.S. from South Korea with her family when she was 7.",
      "Yale-Loehr recalled two other cases where similar powers were invoked in deportation proceedings. In 1987, it was used in a case involving eight people who either held valid student visas or were lawful permanent residents for their pro-Palestinian activism. The deportation case dragged on for 20 years and ended with a judge calling the government's actions \"an embarrassment to the rule of law.\" In the 1990s, the government tried to deport a former Mexican official who was in the U.S. on a visa and faced charges in his home country. The then secretary of state said his deportation was necessary for foreign policy matters.",
      "Attorneys in the recent cases have accused the Trump administration of using immigration enforcement to suppress speech it disagrees with.",
      "Grode said the crackdown could have a chilling effect on the First Amendment. The Trump administration, which ran on a free speech platform, is \"creeping in on attacking some of the very fundamental principles that make America America,\" he said. Still, noncitizens having First Amendment rights \"doesn't negate the ability of the government to revoke their visa,\" he added.",
      "Yale-Loehr expects it will take years for these cases to be settled, predicting that \"it's going to be a mess.\"",
      "\"If there's over 300 students who had their visas revoked, there's going to be a lot of cases challenging it,\" he said. \"I suspect that the litigation will take years to unravel before a court and get a definitive ruling on the extent to which foreign nationals have First Amendment rights.\"",

      "The following is the transcript of an interview with Sue Gordon, Principal Deputy Director of National Intelligence in first Trump administration, and Ret. Gen. Frank McKenzie, a CBS News contributor, that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on March 30, 2025.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: I want to go back to the situation surrounding the administration and the officials use of Signal, a messaging app to discuss military attack plans. In our new CBS News poll- let's see three quarters of Americans say that this was, to them a serious matter matter. A total of 76% of Americans also said the use of the app to discuss military plans was to their way of thinking, not appropriate, and that included eight in 10 independents and more than half of Republicans surveyed. We turn now to Sue Gordon, who served as Principal Deputy Director of National Intelligence during the first Trump administration. She is in Austin. And retired Marine Corps General Frank McKenzie, former head of US Central Command. This marks his first official appearance as a CBS News contributor, and he joins us from Tampa, Florida. Good morning to you both. Sue, I want to start with you. Just break this down for our audience. How much of this falls into anything that you would, through your career, understand to be acceptable communications about sensitive or classified information?",
      "SUE GORDON: Well, good morning, Major. Just top line without getting into classification guides. There is nothing about the information that has to do with operations that is appropriate for this communications channel- none. And- and there are other communications channels that are available for this type of thing, and the risk of loss that comes with uncontrolled communications is profound. So I don't think we need to argue at any level, whether it was appropriate for this path. Now we can talk about how that happened. We can talk about what they could have done, and we can talk about what we do next. But on the top line, this isn't what you discuss in those channels.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: So when the administration, Sue, says, but nothing bad happened. Nobody got to it, so don't worry about it. How do you react to that?",
      "SUE GORDON: One, I'm glad the operation was successful- yay. But we have a saying that says that every success is a failure, where something went right. And I don't think we should rest on the fact that nothing bad happened this time. We don't know whether that communications path has been penetrated. So we don't know whether state actors that have lots of resources are just sitting and lurking now knowing that we do important things on that. Certainly the information that has now come out for any intelligence officer- and I can speak of this with great expertise, that's all super useful for the next time, or for understanding the sources, or understanding how we did the targeting, or understanding how we operate, or what our operational tempo is. So all of that information is valuable. So I'm glad the operation was successful. Now we need to deal with the fact that this should not have happened. There is consequence when it does, and you can't be sure that there is no persistent risk that follows it.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Frank, this story has forests and trees. I don't want to lose the forest. The bigger issue here is a new tempo, an increased tempo of military operations- some of them day in, day in, day in, day-in-out against the Houthis in Yemen. Evaluate that and its importance in understanding the broader context of this story.",
      "GENERAL FRANK MCKENZIE (RET.) : Sure, Major. And first of all, it's great to be with you here today. I think the larger story here is actually that we have finally begun to strike the Houthis hard. There's an old Neil Young song- I'll lift the line from it, should have been done long ago. Well, now we're beginning to do it, and we're beginning to strike effectively at a pace, a scope and a tempo that frankly, eluded the last information- the last administration. And I would argue that we're doing it because for the first time, we have the political will to employ appropriate military capability against the Houthis. And we want one of two things from the Houthis. We want them either to be deterred from attacking ships that pass through the Bab-el-Mandeb, which really means the Suez Canal. That's one condition. The other condition would be, if they won't- if they won't stop, we want to remove their capability to do it. The second task would be harder. It is within our capability. It will not be a short action. It won't be what would call a single period of darkness. These attacks will have to continue. They may grow in scope and scale. They're certainly not endless in time. And we need- we need to- we need to fix the problem and move on to other things. I think the fact that we have a second aircraft carrier that's moving to CENTCOM is certainly a sign that this administration is very serious about this requirement. The fact we're moving B-2s into the region similarly signals that. But I believe again, for the first time, we're coupling genuine political will to act along with military capability. So it's a unique- it's a unique moment in the theater, and I'm glad to see that this administration is grasping that opportunity.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Frank, the terminology you just used, deter and degrade, can that be done from a distance, meaning aerial and from ship borne armaments?",
      "GEN. MCKENZIE: So, I think we can do a very good job of that. I wouldn't take anything off the table. Again, when you take things off the table, it tends to give aid and comfort to the enemy. We've done too much of that. I think we should leave everything on the table and I would also leave on the table, actions against- against Tehran itself. All paths in this matter lead back to Tehran, and we need to know and understand that. They're the principal supplier for the Houthis and right now, Iran is finding it convenient to back pedal and to claim that close relationship. But in fact, the Houthis exist because of Iranian support, and now, to a lesser degree because of Russian support, and we need to recognize that, and we shouldn't give Iran a free ride on this. And I think we have the capability, actually, right now, in Iran's weakened state, to threaten them very strongly. And I'll just say one more thing as I close out on this, Major, the first Trump Administration did three things that put them in a unique place right now in the region. Number one, that administration struck and killed Qassem Soleimani, that's forgotten in the United States, that's not forgotten in Iran. It displayed American will at a level that has generally been absent in the region. Second thing is the signing of the Abraham Accords, which gave Israel the opportunity to enter the region diplomatically, economically and to a degree culturally. It's going to be a rough road, but I think that's only going to expand and last, the movement of Israel from the European Command into the Central Command has actually enabled the very successful defense of Israel that we've seen over the last few weeks and months, and is a huge step forward. All of these taken together give this administration a unique opportunity right now and in the months ahead to shape events in the region.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Sue, I want to go back to you, because Senator Warner on this program just a few moments ago said he's concerned that those in the Five Eyes community, meaning our top intelligence sharing allies, will look at the situation \u2013 whether it's prosecuted or not, they don't care \u2013 as careless as reckless, and they might be legitimately encouraged, therefore, to pull back. Working in the Trump administration the first time around, you worked with our partners there, you know what their sentiments are. Do you share those concerns?",
      "[CROSSTALK]",
      "GEN. MCKENZIE: They may express those concerns. I would argue\u2013",
      "GORDON: I think\u2013",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Frank, this is for Sue. Frank, this is for Sue.",
      "GEN. MCKENZIE: I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Sue, please go ahead.",
      "GORDON: Well, General, anything you have to say is worthwhile, but let me- let me- let me take a run at this. Listen, we count on our allies and partners, and protecting their equities and interests and their sources of information is really important. I- there have been, historically, errors in the past. It's not limited to this one where you find that- that one partner or another has been unable to protect a partner's information. I think what's difficult about this one is two things that the administration does need to address. One is, you really do need to tighten down on how you communicate, because my suspicion is that they were just doing something expedient, and I wish someone on the call had said, hold on, if we're going to go down this path, we need to go to a different channel. But the second thing is the way we're reacting to it when we suggest that there was nothing to see here. I think that's actually the thing that more needs to be addressed with our partners and allies, to say, yeah, we understand that this was not what we should or would have preferred to do, and so to rebuild trust that way. So it's not that there's not error. The issue is, are you doing things that inspire confidence? And I think that we know that, just from an environmental perspective, our relationships with our allies and partners are a little bit tenuous at best, so creating something that causes them to wonder whether we're trustworthy, again, to me, has a huge impact on our ability to advance the things that we want to do.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Frank, you're a CBS contributor, I'm going to give you a one minute time warning on this. Close out with your thoughts about this issue with the Signal chat.",
      "GEN. MCKENZIE: So I think Sue was spot on in her- in her analysis, I would simply argue that I believe the United States remains the indispensable nation in a lot of places. And I think I'm sure we'll learn from this. I would like to think that it won't be repeated, but I think again, it's unfortunate that the Signal chat has really sort of obscured the very good, very real work that's been done in finally addressing a problem that's dragged on far too long, which is Houthi action in the Bab-al-Mandab to close the- effectively closed the Suez Canal.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: And real quick, Frank, when you looked at this, did it shock you? I mean, like, what? You're talking about that there?",
      "GEN. MCKENZIE: I was surprised.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: That's it. You're learning the whole TV thing. Frank Mackenzie and Sue Gordon, thank you very, very much. I appreciate it for your time, your expertise and pulling this all out for the audience. Thank you so much. We'll be right back.",

      "The following is the transcript of an interview with House Budget Committee chairman Rep. Jodey Arrington, Republican of Texas, that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on March 30, 2025.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: We turn now to the Republican chairman of the House Budget Committee, Texas Congressman Jodey Arrington, who joins us this morning from New Orleans. Mr. Chairman, great to see you. Thanks for joining us. In the last month, the Dow has lost 5.14% of its value, the NASDAQ 8%, the S&P 6.2%. Consumer confidence, as you probably are aware, has dipped a bit in the last couple of months. How do you account for all of this?",
      "REP. JODEY ARRINGTON: Well, good morning to you Major. First of all, core inflation is down. Mortgage rates are down just a little bit. Food and gas prices are down. So you're going to have fluctuations in in the financial markets, but we're seeing that the fundamentals are already having an impact on the cost of living, which I think should be job number one of this President, but you've got the tariffs, which I think are critical for our long term prosperity to have that reset, have that Fair and reciprocal trade dynamic that doesn't exist today. So transitioning from the last four years to a new administration with a new economic policy agenda is going to have some adjustments that go with it, and- but I think at the end of the day, you're going to have better prospects for growth. You're going to bring down the prices and you're going to have better prospects for our future, including reducing the debt to GDP, which, as the budget chairman, I can tell you, is completely unsustainable at this point and could bankrupt our country.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Mr. Chairman, one of the top tariff advisers to the president, Peter Navarro, said this morning that tariffs are tax cuts. Are they?",
      "REP. ARRINGTON: Well, in the long run, I think having an unfair trade dynamic at the current point is suppressing growth. It's suppressing wages and suppressing job creation, so it has an adverse impact on our economy. There's no way, Major, to reset the trade dynamic that we've allowed to persist in an unfair way for so long without some disruption. The President has been very transparent about it, and he deployed the same tactics. Now, back in his first administration, successfully, we brought China and others to the table. We had a reset. We had new purchase agreements, we had structural reforms, and we benefited. We had better trade activity, we had better economic activity. And overall, wages grew and life in the American economy, and the quality of life for our fellow Americans was better, so that transition has to happen, and the only person I've seen in my life and experience in politics with the political courage to do it has been President Trump, and I support him 100%.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: When you think about the budget and the process by which to finance tax cuts, either the existing ones or new ones, you're going to count on tariff revenue, are you not?",
      "REP. ARRINGTON: Well, I think we should count on reducing spending that is runaway, bankrupting levels of spending at $2 trillion in annual deficits that will double in the next 10 years. Half of that $2 trillion is interest on the debt that will more than double in the next 10 years. So, we have a spending problem. That deficit spending is driving World War levels of debt and will bankrupt the country. So, I think we should offset the tax cuts with spending reductions and bend that debt to GDP. The revenue from tariffs could do two things, accelerate the reduction of deficit to GDP and do what the President has said he wants to happen in this America First agenda put our nation on a path to balance, but it can also provide tariff relief like he did in the first administration for farmers in West Texas, for example, with the market facilitation payments that took the sting out of the fallout from the early stages of the trade battles, before we had the reset for reciprocal trade. So, I think those are better uses of tariff revenue, but I think we've got to bring down spending. If we don't, then I don't know how much longer we have before, as Ray Dalio says, we're going to have an economic heart attack, and it will undermine everything.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Let's talk about spending for a second. As you know, Mr. Chairman, Medicaid is projected to increase 5.2% each year for the next 10 years. House Republicans have voted for $880 billion in cuts over 10 years. You and I both know you don't have to argue with me about it, that it would be a reduction of the future growth, not a pure cut, but if you lose a service as a Medicaid recipient, that's probably a distinction without a difference. Can you say that when this all gets done, alterations to Medicaid will not change the way people access that program and the health services they receive from it?",
      "REP. ARRINGTON: Major, I'll do better. I think if we don't make these changes, this program and the federal budget in general is not sustainable, because we're allowing states and local organizations to siphon hundreds of billions of dollars away from the Medicaid beneficiary and the Medicaid program. We also this is the one means tested program that doesn't have work requirements for able-bodied adults. We also have a Medicaid program because of the Obamacare expansion and the expansion population of able-bodied adults, where the federal government provides 90 cents on every dollar match for that population, but the preponderance of Medicaid beneficiaries, the blind, the disabled, the poor, the sickest among our fellow citizens, get about 60% to 65% So all of the healthcare system is oriented around the 90% the able bodied adults, and they're not providing the same access, which is to the- to the traditional Medicaid, which is why the outcomes are going down. So, there is a lot of ways to reorient the system, to make it more efficient, to root out waste and fraud, and it's well over the $800 billion. It's common sense, straightforward, and you don't have to touch a dime of the benefits.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Mr. Chairman, very quickly, the President told NBC he \"couldn't care less if foreign automakers raised prices.\" Do you care?",
      "REP. ARRINGTON: What I care about is that our workers and manufacturers in this country are competing head-to-head with China and every other competitor country that we allow their mark their products to come in our markets, open and free, and they don't, they tax our products, and it's hurting our workers. It's hurting our economic output, and we need a reset, and so there's no way to get to that dynamic, that reciprocal trade arrangement, without the tough negotiation tactics of President Trump. He was successful in the first term. We didn't create economic chaos. We didn't even have much of inflation. In fact, the economy was roaring. We had more jobs, more people out of poverty. That's what's going to happen. And I support the president, and he has to prove that he is committed to this, and I believe he is, and I think that's important if we're going to get to the other side of this.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: House Committee- Budget Committee Chairman Jodey Arrington of Texas. Thanks very much, sir. I appreciate it.",

      "The following is the transcript of an interview with Sen. Mark Warner, Democrat of Virginia, that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on March 30, 2025.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Welcome back. We are joined now by the Vice Chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, Virginia Democrat Mark Warner. Senator, always a pleasure. Thanks for coming in. Two things here. We're going to talk about the chat room and we're going to talk about the raid. Let's talk about the raid first. Are you glad this administration is taking a more aggressive military posture against the Houthis and do you believe if it is successful, it will reopen commercial shipping through the Red Sea?",
      "SEN. MARK WARNER: I think we should take more affirmative action. I think the administration is doing the right thing. I would rather than do it with more of our allies involved. But the fact that Donald Trump's America First is turning quickly into America alone, but the basis of going after Houthis in a stronger, tougher way, I agree with.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: The administration argues the Biden administration didn't do enough. Do you agree with that?",
      "SEN. WARNER: I think the Biden administration took repeated action against the Houthis. I think they could have done more.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: All right, now let's get to the chat room. What is your experience? Do you use Signal, for example?",
      "SEN. WARNER: Yes. Signal is safer than your normal cell phone, because the Chinese, through Salt Typhoon, have penetrated our traditional cellular networks. Signal is better, but the Chinese, the Russians, are trying to go after Signal. They've- they've made- had some successful efforts. Everyone is warned in the intelligence community, do not use Signal for classified information. It is bright, it is bold, it is a- it is cyber hygiene 101, in terms of how to stay safe.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: One of the things discussed in this chat, which the administration has said is accurate, was a reference to a high value Houthi target at his girlfriend's house somewhere in Yemen, probably Sanaa, near the capital. David Martin, my exceptional colleague here at CBS, has reported that the Israelis are furious about this because they believe those who would read that could sort of backward engineer that and find something out that they shouldn't find out. Do you agree with that? What do you think the implications of that are?",
      "SEN. WARNER : I have not seen any of the classified information about this, so I'm basing my knowledge on open source. If the Israelis are this mad, and I think they got a right to be this mad about classified information being treated sloppily, and this is a pattern. We've seen them expose CIA agents in the first two weeks. We've seen the DOGE boys print the full budget and head counts of a classified agency. So this is not a one off. And what happens if the Israelis are this mad and the Five Eye partners, our key allies, are upset, will they continue to share information with us if it's treated this sloppily. And if we don't see action taken by this administration, if someone is not held accountable, I believe Secretary Hegseth should resign or be fired. I think Mike Waltz should resign or be fired. If no action is taken, what message does that send to the workforce? Because Maj- Major, I can tell you this, if you were a military officer or a CIA agent and you treated classified information this way, you would be fired. End of story.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: When Republicans say it was a mistake and they'll never make it again, does that satisfy you?",
      "SEN. WARNER: Baloney. I'd use stronger language- Sunday morning, but it's like this is a pattern of sloppiness. I mean, think about the DOGE boys when they print all the savings and half of the information just factually wrong. This administration does not treat classified information the appropriate way, Major. We don't- we've not even seen if the phones that were used, have they been collected? Had they been checked to make sure the bad guys didn't put malware in them? That, again, would be the first action of a serious administration. I've asked the FBI Director whether he's launching an investigation. I've heard nothing back from him.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Does it give you any comfort that the Chairman of the Armed Services Committee, Roger Wicker, a Republican and the Democrat Jack Reed, have called for an inspector general investigation? And is that enough?",
      "SEN. WARNER: I'm glad there's that bipartisan effort. I hope there will be additional ones. I hope, frankly, I think the Department of Justice needs to look at whether laws have been broken. Because, again, put this in context, the Director of National Intelligence, I think, 12-13, days ago, boldly tweeted out, you know, anybody that leaks information should be pursued to the full extent of the law? Well, if Tulsi Gabbard believes that, is that just for others, or does that standard apply to her as well? Well, she frankly, in our hearing, one, refused to acknowledge she was even on the call to start with, wouldn't tell us if her phone was hers or the government, and then, at least initially, said there was no classified information at all. When clearly, if you've got this kind of information about time of an attack that's classified, and one of the things I'd love her or Hegseth to do is go down to the Norfolk, Virginia Beach area. I was there yesterday for a couple town halls. The aircraft carrier Truman is home ported in Norfolk. I was talking yesterday with friends and family of members who are on the Truman. Their anger level was so high because if that information had gotten out and the Houthis had been able to redirect their defensive tools, very likely, we would have had American life loss. That could've been prevented if you just have treat classified information appropriately.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Talk about something else that is of deep concern to you because you wrote the law. Oracle appears to be in deep talks with the administration about some method of acquiring Tiktok before the April 5 deadline. It's not clear whether or not China would retain ownership of the ever important algorithm within Tiktok. What do you know? What are your concerns? What's going to happen?",
      "SEN. WARNER: What I know is I believe there are four bidders. I don't know all of the bidders, but I can tell you this. If there is a result, no matter how much kind of Trump publicity around this, that suddenly we've got a new owner, if we've got a result and the algorithm resides in Beijing, it is all a sham, because the ability to manipulate that algorithm to what we see on that TikTok channel- and again, remember, China doesn't offer Tiktok to their own young people that are getting, you know, we get the crack version. And where you can manipulate information, you can put Chinese propaganda out, and if that algorithm does not move whatever transfer, then the whole thing's a sham.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: And it violates the law.",
      "SEN. WARNER: And it violates the law. And the irony of this, Major, it was Donald Trump in his first administration that first pointed out the problems with TikTok. Candidly, I didn't fully agree until I did my own research and I go, holy heck, collecting data and this power of a propaganda tool, it should not be available to Americans. Eighty percent of the Congress, both parties agree.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Senator Warner, stay right there. We'll have more questions for you, and for you at home, please stay with us, we'll be right back.",
      "[COMMERCIAL BREAK]",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Welcome back to Face the Nation. We return to our conversation with Senator Mark Warner, Democrat of Virginia, Vice Chair of the Intelligence Committee. So the intelligence community released its National Threat Assessment Tuesday. Among the things it said was China is going after Greenland's natural resources, saying they, China, will use the same access as a key strategic foothold for advancing China's broader and economic aims in the Arctic. The Vice President was there with his wife a couple of days ago. President Trump recently said 100% America will get Greenland, and did not rule out, if necessary, the possible use of military force in America to do that. Is Greenland a legitimate strategic issue? Point 1. Point 2, how is this administration pursuing that legitimate interest, if there is one?",
      "SEN. WARNER: Greenland has got a lot of rare earth minerals and has enormous value, just as many other places around the world do, so legitimate interests and stronger ties with Greenland, absolutely. The idea that we are going to threaten a military invasion against a population that at least everything I've read, overwhelmingly people in Greenland don't want to become part of America. The going against Denmark, who is a NATO member, who rules Greenland currently, this whole approach that Trump has of treating our allies, I mean, he turned Canada into an enemy, our allies as not allies. And suddenly wanting to buddy up with Putin in Russia or with Xi in China. Think about it. America, two weeks ago, three weeks ago, voted with Russia, North Korea, I think it was Belarus, against everyone else who was a democracy, because we wouldn't acknowledge that Putin started the war in Ukraine. This is a crazy foreign policy, and America is stronger when we have allies. America alone is weaker if we don't have that intelligence sharing, if we don't have these mutual defense pacts.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: That National Threat Assessment also had a notable shift, saying that the biggest threat to America was drug cartels, gangs, fentanyl, Islamic terrorists, not Russia and China. Do you agree?",
      "SEN. WARNER: I think the threat of drugs is awful, and we need to do more against fentanyl. I think the long term strategic technology competition with China is the issue, not just of today, but of the next 30 years, it's AI, it's quantum, it's a whole series of biotech as well. On the question of Russia, here's the remarkable thing, the intelligence assessment said Russia is still an enemy, and said Russia is still going to do malign election interference. In that document, they say that at the very same time, the Trump administration is getting rid of the election threat group inside our intelligence community, that is a complete contradiction.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Very quickly, this threat assessment does not mention climate change. It was there in the previous Trump administration and the Biden administration. Your reaction?",
      "SEN. WARNER: Denial of science doesn't mean that it's not happening. One of the reasons why Greenland in the Arctic, because we've had so much ice melt, there are a whole suddenly set of new shipping lanes. You can't deny what is happening. Call it sea level rise. Call it whatever you want. We spend hundreds of millions of dollars raising the piers each year in Norfolk because of sea level rise. You can't ignore what's happening.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Democratic Senator Mark Warner, Virginia, Vice Chair of the Senate Intelligence community. Thanks very much.",
      "SEN. WARNER: Thank you, Major.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: And we'll be right back.",

    "story": [
      "The following is the transcript of the full interview with Shawn Fain, president of United Auto Workers, that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on March 30, 2025.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: We go now to the president of the United Auto Workers Union, Shawn Fain. Shawn, it's great to have you with us. I appreciate the time. Let's start very simply on the question of tariffs on autos and auto parts. Fundamentally, and quite simply, why do you believe those are helpful for your membership?",
      "SHAWN FAIN: Thanks for having me. Look, all you have to do is look at the history of the United States, especially in auto manufacturing in the last 30 years, with the inception of NAFTA and unfair trade laws. We've seen over 90,000 manufacturing facilities leave the United States. We've seen- in the Big Three alone, in the last 20 plus years, 65 plants have closed. You know- And so look, tariffs aren't the total solution. Tariffs are a tool in the toolbox to get these companies to do the right thing, and- and the intent behind it is to bring jobs back here. And, you know, invest in the American workers. The American working class people have been left behind for decades, and they're sick of it. You know, it's a massive struggle. People are struggling just to get- to survive right now, to get by. And so, you know- you know- you know, there's two parts to the tariffs though. I mean, the tariffs are a motivator. We have to fix the broken trade laws. And the other thing to me is, you know, these can't just be just, you know, as with the Biden administration, when they did the stuff for battery work and EV work, we had to come in and say, no, these can't just be union jobs or- or jobs. They got to be good paying union jobs that set standards. So the big part of this that gets left out a lot of times is, if they're going to bring jobs back here, you know, they need to be life sustaining jobs where people can make a good wage, a living wage, have adequate health care and have a retirement security and not have to work seven days a week or multiple jobs, just a scrape to get by, paycheck to paycheck.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Do you have assurances from the Trump administration as you dialogue with it about those things you just laid out, not just jobs, but a substantial wage, healthcare and the like?",
      "SHAWN FAIN: I mean that- I mean that is the conversation we're having naturally. I mean, we, you know, that's- that's the part of this. I mean, look, I'll be honest with you, it's- every time we speak, we talk about bringing jobs back, about bringing the manufacturing base back in this country, you know. But you know, it doesn't do any good if they're going to locate them in places and they're not going to have the opportunity to have a union, you know. And so naturally, we have concerns. We have great concerns after- after what happened last night. You know, with the stroke of a marker, you know, Trump eliminated bargaining- or eliminated contracts for 700,000 federal workers. You know, we have- we have concerns with what's going on with our higher education sector that we represent. We have members who are being detained, you know, their right to free speech being violated. We have workers at the National Institute of Health that provide vital research, and that- that is for the betterment of the people. So, you know, we have big concerns with that. So naturally, yes, every time we talk about trade, talk about tariffs, it's an integral part of that, these have to be good paying union jobs.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: I'll get back to the tariffs and autos in a second. But since you brought up this executive order, it regards an effort by the Trump administration, through the President, to stop- or certainly dramatically slow collective bargaining for federal workers. Randy Ervin [sic], who is currently the president of the National Federation of the Federal Employees, called it \"the biggest assault on collective bargaining\" he has ever seen. Do you agree with those sentiments?",
      "SHAWN FAIN: Exactly. I mean, spot on. Look, I remember when I was 12 years old when Reagan busted the PATCO workers, you know that was a massive issue back then and we've heard a lot of people talk about the labor--",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: The air traffic controllers union, yes--",
      "SHAWN FAIN:\u00a0 Yes, yes. And you know that- that, you know, labor should have done more then. Look, this is 100 times worse than PATCO ever dreamed of being. When you're talking, you know, 700,000 people, their contracts just being taken away. And so, you know, as I said, you know, free speech is under attack. Unions are under attack. You look at the changes to the NLRB, you look at the situation at the Department of Labor, Department of Education, you know, Veterans Affairs. I mean, why are all these things under attack? Medicare, Social Security. It's because, you know, billionaires want more tax cuts for themselves, and that we- it's been proven time and again that's not what works for America. That's not good for the American people. The working class people in America, they want their fair share. They're not asking to be rich. They just want a decent standard of living. And again, that goes back to what we call our four core issues. You know, living wages, adequate health care, retirement security and having some quality of life other than just everything revolving around work.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: So for those listening to you, Shawn, do you want them to conclude, well, if we get the tariffs and there are a few more auto jobs, it's worth all the other terrible- or maybe terrible- that's too strong a word, but all the other things you just talked about: Medicaid, free speech, collective bargaining, is that a deal that's worth them taking?",
      "SHAWN FAIN: Not at all. Let me be clear about this, you know, because I think this is being misconstrued here, there's been no change in where we stand politically as a union, and where, you know, what our stance is. Look, we've been very clear since day one of my administration. You know, we have expectations. Endorsements are earned, but at the end of the day, like we're not, we know we're not partisan to any one- any one party here. We expect, no matter what party someone comes from, to stand up for what we believe in. So just because we find common ground on tariffs or on trade doesn't mean that everything else goes out the window. It's despicable what happened last night. It's despicable some of the other things that are going on. Like I said, some of our members have been detained. You know, their jobs are being threatened, and it's unacceptable. So no, there is no trade off here, you know. So we- we continue to do what we do, and we have integrity. When we can- when we can work with a politician on an issue, and we get traction, we're going to work with them, but where we can't, we're going to be just as vocal.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Understood. Let's get back to the tariffs and the auto industry. Peter Navarro, a top adviser to the president on trade, says currently, automobile manufacturing plants are at about 60% capacity. He argues that there's lots of untapped capacity, meaning jobs could be created relatively easy, and you didn't have to need- you wouldn't need to spend two or three or maybe five years building new factories. Is that your understanding? Is that your belief?",
      "SHAWN FAIN: It's- he's spot on. Look, we have a situation right now in Warren, Michigan where 2,000 workers were laid off this past year. They- they built the Ram truck there for years under Stellantis, and Stellantis made a decision to shift that production to Mexico. They could shift that work back in- in very short order and be producing Ram trucks right back there and put those people back to work. I was just at Volkswagen this week, you know, talking with workers down there that are trying to get their first contract, and the company announced a reduction of a shift. Meanwhile, you know, Volkswagen is the biggest violator of all. They- 75% of their production for the North American market is made in Mexico, so they can shift product there overnight. There's excess capacity. You know, we- people forget this lesson in World War II. The way that we- we formed the Arsenal of Democracy that won the war was, they took the excess capacity of all the automotive manufacturing plants in the country, and produced tanks and planes and bombs and engines and all those things. And it's no different right now. We have excess capacity. They could bring work back in very short order. And yes, they're- in a situation where they need to build a new plant, yeah, that's going to take a couple years, but- but there is plenty of opportunity for these companies to do the right thing and bring work back here overnight, just as quick as they shifted out of here.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: And Shawn, for people who are listening to you, how do tariffs make that happen? How do- what is the relationship between a 20 or 25% tariff and getting that capacity back up to where you'd like it to see- you'd like to see it?",
      "SHAWN FAIN: Well, because, like everything, the companies abuse the process. I mean, they- you know, they- they- they're in the pursuit of driving a race to the bottom. I mean, the tariffs are- you know, there was a major promise when NAFTA- and we go back to when NAFTA happened in 1992, the big debate, and- and Ross Perot talked about the giant sucking sound, that our manufacturing base was going to disappear. He was spot on, you know. And- and we saw what happened in the- in the ensuing 30 years. We see 90,000 plants leave. You know, like I said, we've seen 65 plants in the Big Three close. Look, right now, as we speak, in- in- in Wisconsin, we have a Deere plant threatening to be closed, and their work being- being threatened to go to Mexico. We have a heavy truck plant in- at Volvo, and Mack Truck in Pennsylvania being threatened to be taken to Mexico. There is plenty of opportunity, and that's the reality that- that we've seen here in America. So, tariffs are a tool in the toolbox. They're not the end all solution. We have to fix the broken trade system. But- but the way tariffs work, I mean, it's a motivator, because there's going to be a penalty for everything the companies ship in here, and I've had companies tell us, point blank, that they're going to have to bring product back here if those tariffs are implemented.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: You mentioned NAFTA. Of course, NAFTA has been replaced by USMCA. And I well remember, and you might remember this, Shawn, January 2020, President Trump in the Rose Garden said the following: \"USMCA is the largest, fairest, most balanced modern trade agreement ever achieved. It will add another 1.2% to our GDP, create countless new American jobs.\" Again, I'm quoting, \"It will make our blue collar boom.\" Is USMCA a part of this problem, negotiated by President Trump?",
      "SHAWN FAIN: Well, yes. I mean, USMCA, I mean, obviously there were changes made, there were- there were some improvements, but it didn't go far enough. There were still a lot of loopholes in it. And, you know, we- as a result of the- of the renegotiated NAFTA, you know, we still saw an increase in the deficit we have, especially with Mexico. But at the end of the day it's up for renegotiation next year. So nothing stops them from- from getting to work, you know, and we're right here. We're here every day. We've been very open with them about, we want to work with them. We want to find ways to fix the USMCA and- and fix the atrocities of NAFTA that the working class in this country have suffered and the communities in this country have suffered for decades.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Shawn, the market research firm Cox Automotive, for this year, is projecting 700,000 fewer cars will be produced and sold, because of consumer anxiety over sticky inflation, meaning persistent inflation, and nervousness about cost impacts of tariffs. If 700,000 cars, or trucks, fewer, are being made and sold, how does that help your workforce?",
      "SHAWN FAIN: Well, it doesn't. But, you know, we need to be- we need to take a hard look at this, because those same- the same economists that are saying this now are the same ones in 1992 that said, overnight, when NAFTA was created, there would be 400,000 jobs created in America in the first year. We know what happened there. They got it wrong. And the interesting part to me- all this crying about the effects of- of tariffs, I find it interesting, because to me, this is just Wall Street. Now that Wall Street's upset about it, it's an issue. Where was Wall Street when- when all these manufacturing facilities have been leaving the country in the last 30 years? You know, interestingly enough, you know, automotive companies in the last three years, 2019- 2019 to 2023, they jacked up the price of vehicles 35% to 40% over that time frame. Not because of anything that happened, not because wages went up. It was just flat out price gouging to consumer and corporate greed. Where was the outcry then? They don't have to raise the price of vehicles a penny with these tariffs. It's a decision that the companies are making, and that lays straight in the hands of the- of the companies.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: The White House also says when it comes to the auto industry, currently, we are essentially an assembly auto industry, we don't make drive trains. We don't make the things within the car that have the most material value and the most worker involvement. A, is that true? And B, how does that change?",
      "SHAWN FAIN: Well, it's somewhat true. There's been a huge shift in the last several decades, thanks to the unfair trade laws, where a lot of the, you know, the parts, the supply chain, the parts and the engines and transmissions have been sourced. But we still do produce those things. I can tell you where I come from, at Kokomo, Indiana. We still make the transmissions. We make engine blocks. We still produce engines here in Michigan, in the Big Three. So we still do some of that work. I mean, we've brought, you know, some of the battery work in thanks to the Biden administration and their plans with the IRA. I mean, so, you know, we're working on a lot of that work, you know. So that is powertrain type work, so the drive trains, things like that. But yes, a lot of that work was sourced, was casualties of NAFTA and broken trade laws.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: And when you think about the future of the auto industry for the next two or three years, does it survive without tariffs?",
      "SHAWN FAIN: Like I said, I think tariffs are a tool in the toolbox. I think they're a initial motivator, but ultimately, we have to fix the broken trade laws in this country and any trade laws we have-\u00a0 let's be clear about this. It has to have a social policy, and it's got to have a decent standard of living. It's got to have adequate health care for everyone. It's got to have retirement security for people when they're too old to work and too young to die, and it's got to have some quality of life initiatives into it, where people don't have to work around the clock and their life has to revolve around- around work. So, you know, there's a lot of things we have to fix to make it work. You know, and I want to make this clear. Mexican workers, they're not the enemy. They've been exploited for decades. You know, another promise of NAFTA was that it was going to raise the standard for everybody. The realization of that is the wages in America and the wages in Mexico were cut in half over the- over the last 30 years as a result of NAFTA. So it's driving a race to the bottom, and that's not going to work for anybody.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Shawn, your membership makes you powerful, so you associate with presidents. From your perspective, what's more valuable to your membership, a president who walks a picket line or imposes tariffs?",
      "SHAWN FAIN: I mean, it's- it's- it's both. I mean, a president- ultimately, it's a president that supports organized labor and supports good working conditions and good safe jobs and good union contracts, and so that's the big concern right now. I mean, you know, while we applaud the shift with tariffs here under this administration, again, it's deplorable what happened last night with the stroke of a marker, you know, stripping away bargaining- stripping away contractual rights for hundreds of thousands of union workers, attacking the free speech of union workers. So, you know, and we can't stand for that. So like I said\u2013",
      "(CROSSTALK)",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: And how about changes at the National Labor Relations Board?",
      "SHAWN FAIN: --we do take this issue by issue.",

    "summary": "Denmark's foreign minister posted a video scolding the Trump administration hours after Vice President JD Vance's visit to Greenland.",
    "story": [
      "The Danish foreign minister scolded the Trump administration on Saturday for its \"tone\" criticizing Denmark and Greenland during Vice President JD Vance's visit to the strategic island.",
      "Vance \u2014 joined by his wife, second lady Usha Vance, national security adviser Mike Waltz, Secretary of Energy Chris Wright and Sen. Mike Lee of Utah \u2014 on Friday visited the Pituffick Space Base, the northernmost U.S. military installation, in Greenland. The trip had been scaled back after an uproar among Greenlanders and Danges who were not consulted about the original itinerary. While there, the vice president blasted Denmark for its handling of the island, saying the U.S. base in Greenland is less secure than it was decades ago because of Denmark's stewardship.",
      "\"There is no amount of bullying, no amount of obfuscating, no amount of confusing the issue,\" Vance said. \"Our message to Denmark is very simple: You have not done a good job by the people of Greenland, you have underinvested in the people of Greenland, and you have underinvested in the security architecture of this incredible, beautiful landmass filled with incredible people. That has to change. And because it hasn't changed, that's why President Trump's policy in Greenland is what it is.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has eyed the semi-autonomous Danish territory\u00a0despite opposition from residents and leaders. The president told NBC News in an interview on Saturday that \"we'll get Greenland,\" saying there's a \"good possibility that we could do it without military force,\" while adding that \"I don't take anything off the table.\"",
      "Earlier Saturday, Danish Foreign Minister Lars L\u00f8kke Rasmussen posted a video on social media scolding the Trump administration, saying his country is already investing more into Arctic security and remains open to more cooperation with the U.S.",
      "\"Many accusations and many allegations have been made. And of course, we are open to criticism,\" Rasmussen said speaking in English. \"But let me be completely honest: we do not appreciate the tone in which it is being delivered. This is not how you speak to your close allies. And I still consider Denmark and the United States to be close allies.\"",
      "Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen also pushed back on Vance's claim that Denmark isn't doing enough for defense in the Arctic, calling her country \"a good and strong ally.\"",
      "Vivian Motzfeldt, Greenland's foreign minister told CBS News she wants cooperation with the U.S., not domination.",
      "\"You just don't take over. You speak and you talk. That's all politics is about,\" she said.",
      "Danish King Frederik X posted on Facebook: \"We live in an altered reality. There should be no doubt that my love for Greenland and my connectedness to the people of Greenland are intact.\"",
      "Hundreds of protesters demonstrated Saturday outside the U.S. Embassy in the Danish capital Copenhagen with some lifting signs saying, \"back off, USA\"\u00a0Danish broadcaster TV2 reported.",
      "L\u00f8kke Rasmussen, in his video, reminded viewers of the 1951 defense agreement between Denmark and the United States. Since 1945, the American military presence in Greenland has decreased from thousands of soldiers over 17 bases and installations on the island, he said, to the remote Pituffik Space Base in the northwest with some 200 soldiers today.",
      "The 1951 agreement \"offers ample opportunity for the United States to have a much stronger military presence in Greenland,\" the foreign minister said. \"If that is what you wish, then let us discuss it.\"",
      "L\u00f8kke Rasmussen added that Denmark has increased its own investment into Arctic defense. In January, Denmark announced 14.6 billion Danish kroner (US$2.1 billion) in financial commitments for Arctic security covering three new naval vessels, long-range drones and satellites.",
      "The second lady was originally scheduled to visit Greenland in an expanded cultural trip this week, and then the vice president\u00a0announced\u00a0Tuesday that he would be joining her for a shorter trip that was more focused on U.S. policy and defense.",
      "A\u00a0recent poll\u00a0shows 85% of Greenlanders do not want to be part of the United States.",

    "published": "Mon, 31 Mar 2025 20:30:56 -0400",
    "summary": "NASA astronauts Butch Wilmore and Sunita Williams, who were stuck in space for more than nine months, took questions after returning to Earth.",
    "story": [
      "Starliner astronauts Butch Wilmore and Sunita Williams, speaking out at a news conference for the first time since returning to Earth after an extended 286-day stay in space, said Monday they did not blame Boeing for the spacecraft problems that effectively stranded them aboard the International Space Station.",
      "In fact, asked if he would fly again aboard the Starliner, Wilmore said, \"Yes, because we're going to rectify all the issues that we encountered. We're going to fix them. We're going to make it work. Boeing is completely committed. NASA is completely committed, and with that, I'd get on in a heartbeat.\"",
      "Added Williams: \"I would agree. The spacecraft is really capable. There were a couple things that need to be fixed ... and folks are actively working on that, but it is a great spacecraft, and it has a lot of capability that other spacecraft don't have. To see that thing successful and to be part of that program is an honor.\"",
      "Asked if he blamed Boeing for the propulsion system helium leaks and thruster problems that ultimately led NASA to bring the Starliner down without its crew, extending their stay aboard the space station from eight days to more than nine-and-a-half months, Wilmore said, \"That is a question that I cannot answer in a couple of comments. But I'll start with me.\"",
      "\"There were questions that I, as the commander of the spacecraft, that I should have asked, and I did not. At the time, I didn't know I needed to. And maybe you could call that hindsight, but I'll start and point the finger and I'll blame me. I could have asked some questions and the answers to those questions could have turned the tide.",
      "\"So blame, I don't like that term, but certainly there's responsibility throughout all the programs and certainly you can start with me. Responsibility with Boeing? Yes. Responsibility with NASA? Yes. All the way up and down the chain. We all are responsible. We all own this.\"",
      "Their repeatedly extended mission generated enormous attention in the wake of problems with Starliner, NASA's decision three months after launch to keep them in orbit until this year, and comments from President Trump claiming the astronauts had been \"abandoned\" in space by the Biden administration.",
      "Williams denied feeling \"abandoned\" or \"stuck\" during an interview with CBS News in February, saying she was \"honored ... to be here and a part of the team\" doing \"world-class science.\" They said much of the same Monday. But they avoided answering questions about the political aspects of the mission.",
      "Wilmore and Williams returned to Earth on March 18, accompanied by two outgoing station fliers who were wrapping up their own six-month stay aboard the lab. The Starliner astronauts, like all returning station fliers, began physical therapy back at the Johnson Space Center to help them readjust to gravity.",
      "They both looked fit and were in obviously good spirits talking with reporters Monday. In fact, Williams said she went for a 3-mile run on Sunday.",
      "How long were the astronauts stuck in space?",
      "By the time they splashed down off Florida's Gulf Coast, Wilmore and Williams had spent 286 days in space.",
      "While the extended mission was much longer than originally planned, it ranks sixth on the list of longest flights by U.S. astronauts.",
      "The record is held by astronaut Frank Rubio, whose planned six-month stay aboard the space station was extended to just over a full year \u2014 371 days \u2014 because of coolant leaks in the Russian Soyuz that carried him to orbit. He came back to Earth aboard a replacement Soyuz in September 2023.",
      "Even though his record remains unbroken, problems with the Boeing Starliner that carried Wilmore and Williams to space triggered extensive coverage in the United States that far exceeded the coverage of Rubio's even longer mission.",
      "Why were the astronauts stuck in space so long?",
      "Three years after the space shuttle's retirement in 2011, NASA awarded multibillion-dollar contracts to Boeing and SpaceX to build ferry ships to carry astronauts to and from the space station. SpaceX has now launched 11 piloted Crew Dragon flights for NASA and five purely commercial missions. A sixth commercial launch is currently scheduled for Monday night.",
      "But Boeing ran into multiple problems with its Starliner that required two unpiloted test flights before Wilmore, who is 62, and Williams, 59, both former military test pilots, were finally cleared to launch last June 5 on the spacecraft's first piloted mission after engineers decided a small helium leak in the ship's propulsion pressurization system would not get worse.",
      "The astronauts successfully docked with the space station the next day, but the Starliner experienced additional helium propulsion system leaks and several maneuvering jets did not produce the expected thrust.",
      "While the flight originally was expected to last about eight days, NASA and Boeing carried out weeks of tests and analysis to determine what caused the problems and whether the spacecraft could be trusted to safely bring its crew back to Earth.",
      "By August, Boeing managers were convinced engineers understood the problems and the crew could, in fact, safely come home in the Starliner.",
      "But NASA managers eventually ruled out that option and decided to keep the astronauts aboard the station until early this year when they could hitch a ride home aboard a Crew Dragon. That spacecraft was launched last September with just two crew members on board, along with two empty seats for Wilmore and Williams.",
      "The Starliner, meanwhile, successfully returned to Earth earlier in September, kicking off hands-on troubleshooting and ongoing work to prepare for the eventual resumption of flights.",
      "Wilmore, Williams, Crew 9 Dragon commander Nick Hague and cosmonaut Alexander Gorbunov originally planned to return to Earth in February. But the Crew 10 Dragon needed to carry their replacements to the station ran into problems of its own and the flight was delayed to the end of March.",
      "Those problems, and the threat of additional delays, prompted NASA to switch the Crew 10 fliers to a different Crew Dragon, eventually moving its launch up to March 12, paving the way for Crew 9 to head home.",

      "Stories from mass shooting survivors and their loved ones, as well as new research, are creating more awareness of gun violence. A new study from the University of Colorado Boulder\u00a0shows that 1 in 15 American adults have been on the scene of a mass shooting. This study defines a mass shooting as an incident when four or more people are shot in a public space.",
      "The research comes as those in the Boulder community gathered four years later to remember the 2021 King Soopers shooting that took the lives of 10 people and impacted countless others.",
      "That impact includes Erika Mahoney, whose father Kevin was killed while grocery shopping that day. Four years later, it's easy to see Mahoney's strong bond with her dad in family albums and frames throughout the house.",
      "Mahoney showed CBS News Colorado some of those photos, describing them as she thumbed through.",
      "\"Here we're in the kitchen, and dad, I'm wearing my dad's giant jacket,\" Mahoney said. \"It's motivating to see his face, but I also hear him saying, like, keep going.\"",
      "As a former journalist, Mahoney is now dedicating her life to sharing stories like his and documenting the lasting impact of gun violence.",
      "\"The news covers [mass shootings] in the beginning, and the hardest part is those years in between where you're crying in the corner, or you can't go grocery shopping, or you are, you know, missing your dad and it's Father's Day,\" Mahoney said.",
      "To showcase those moments and the generational pain that can follow a mass shooting, she's releasing a new podcast this spring. Senseless\u00a0will feature more than a dozen people affected by gun violence in Boulder.",
      "\"At its heart, this podcast is truly a love letter to my dad, and it's about how we move forward after tragedy,\" Mahoney said.",
      "One of her podcast guests will be David Pyrooz, a professor of sociology and criminologist at the Institute for Behavioral Science at CU Boulder. His episode will break down his new study that came up with the data behind the 1 in 15, or about 7% of U.S. adults on average that have been at the scene of a mass shooting.",
      "\"It means you were in the direct vicinity to where you could see the shooter. There were bullets that were fired in your direction, or if you couldn't directly see the shooter, that you could hear the gunshots,\" Pyrooz said.",
      "The study came to that number by surveying 10,000 people last year. The research also details that more than 2% of U.S. adults have been injured during a mass shooting.",
      "Pyrooz explains, \"Mass shootings, you know, I know they occur across the world, but, you know, in the United States, there's just such a concerted interest and focus on it, and we should aim to understand this better.\"",

    "summary": "NASA astronauts Butch Wilmore and Sunita Williams, who were stuck in space for more than nine months, took questions after returning to Earth.",
    "story": [
      "Starliner astronauts Butch Wilmore and Sunita Williams, speaking out at a news conference for the first time since returning to Earth after an extended 286-day stay in space, said Monday they did not blame Boeing for the spacecraft problems that effectively stranded them aboard the International Space Station.",
      "In fact, asked if he would fly again aboard the Starliner, Wilmore said, \"Yes, because we're going to rectify all the issues that we encountered. We're going to fix them. We're going to make it work. Boeing is completely committed. NASA is completely committed, and with that, I'd get on in a heartbeat.\"",
      "Added Williams: \"I would agree. The spacecraft is really capable. There were a couple things that need to be fixed ... and folks are actively working on that, but it is a great spacecraft, and it has a lot of capability that other spacecraft don't have. To see that thing successful and to be part of that program is an honor.\"",
      "Asked if he blamed Boeing for the propulsion system helium leaks and thruster problems that ultimately led NASA to bring the Starliner down without its crew, extending their stay aboard the space station from eight days to more than nine-and-a-half months, Wilmore said, \"That is a question that I cannot answer in a couple of comments. But I'll start with me.\"",
      "\"There were questions that I, as the commander of the spacecraft, that I should have asked, and I did not. At the time, I didn't know I needed to. And maybe you could call that hindsight, but I'll start and point the finger and I'll blame me. I could have asked some questions and the answers to those questions could have turned the tide.",
      "\"So blame, I don't like that term, but certainly there's responsibility throughout all the programs and certainly you can start with me. Responsibility with Boeing? Yes. Responsibility with NASA? Yes. All the way up and down the chain. We all are responsible. We all own this.\"",
      "Their repeatedly extended mission generated enormous attention in the wake of problems with Starliner, NASA's decision three months after launch to keep them in orbit until this year, and comments from President Trump claiming the astronauts had been \"abandoned\" in space by the Biden administration.",
      "Williams denied feeling \"abandoned\" or \"stuck\" during an interview with CBS News in February, saying she was \"honored ... to be here and a part of the team\" doing \"world-class science.\" They said much of the same Monday. But they avoided answering questions about the political aspects of the mission.",
      "Wilmore and Williams returned to Earth on March 18, accompanied by two outgoing station fliers who were wrapping up their own six-month stay aboard the lab. The Starliner astronauts, like all returning station fliers, began physical therapy back at the Johnson Space Center to help them readjust to gravity.",
      "They both looked fit and were in obviously good spirits talking with reporters Monday. In fact, Williams said she went for a 3-mile run on Sunday.",
      "How long were the astronauts stuck in space?",
      "By the time they splashed down off Florida's Gulf Coast, Wilmore and Williams had spent 286 days in space.",
      "While the extended mission was much longer than originally planned, it ranks sixth on the list of longest flights by U.S. astronauts.",
      "The record is held by astronaut Frank Rubio, whose planned six-month stay aboard the space station was extended to just over a full year \u2014 371 days \u2014 because of coolant leaks in the Russian Soyuz that carried him to orbit. He came back to Earth aboard a replacement Soyuz in September 2023.",
      "Even though his record remains unbroken, problems with the Boeing Starliner that carried Wilmore and Williams to space triggered extensive coverage in the United States that far exceeded the coverage of Rubio's even longer mission.",
      "Why were the astronauts stuck in space so long?",
      "Three years after the space shuttle's retirement in 2011, NASA awarded multibillion-dollar contracts to Boeing and SpaceX to build ferry ships to carry astronauts to and from the space station. SpaceX has now launched 11 piloted Crew Dragon flights for NASA and five purely commercial missions. A sixth commercial launch is currently scheduled for Monday night.",
      "But Boeing ran into multiple problems with its Starliner that required two unpiloted test flights before Wilmore, who is 62, and Williams, 59, both former military test pilots, were finally cleared to launch last June 5 on the spacecraft's first piloted mission after engineers decided a small helium leak in the ship's propulsion pressurization system would not get worse.",
      "The astronauts successfully docked with the space station the next day, but the Starliner experienced additional helium propulsion system leaks and several maneuvering jets did not produce the expected thrust.",
      "While the flight originally was expected to last about eight days, NASA and Boeing carried out weeks of tests and analysis to determine what caused the problems and whether the spacecraft could be trusted to safely bring its crew back to Earth.",
      "By August, Boeing managers were convinced engineers understood the problems and the crew could, in fact, safely come home in the Starliner.",
      "But NASA managers eventually ruled out that option and decided to keep the astronauts aboard the station until early this year when they could hitch a ride home aboard a Crew Dragon. That spacecraft was launched last September with just two crew members on board, along with two empty seats for Wilmore and Williams.",
      "The Starliner, meanwhile, successfully returned to Earth earlier in September, kicking off hands-on troubleshooting and ongoing work to prepare for the eventual resumption of flights.",
      "Wilmore, Williams, Crew 9 Dragon commander Nick Hague and cosmonaut Alexander Gorbunov originally planned to return to Earth in February. But the Crew 10 Dragon needed to carry their replacements to the station ran into problems of its own and the flight was delayed to the end of March.",
      "Those problems, and the threat of additional delays, prompted NASA to switch the Crew 10 fliers to a different Crew Dragon, eventually moving its launch up to March 12, paving the way for Crew 9 to head home.",

    "published": "Mon, 31 Mar 2025 19:17:00 -0400",
    "summary": "President Donald Trump again suggested he may try to run for a third term in office, despite limits set by the 12th and 22nd Amendments.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump has periodically floated the idea of serving a third term in office since his first reelection campaign and seemed to double down on it Sunday during an interview with NBC News, suggesting \"there are methods\" to do it despite term limits set by the 12th and 22nd Amendments in the U.S. Constitution.",
      "To date, Franklin D. Roosevelt is the only president in the history of the United States to serve more than two terms, ultimately sitting in office from 1933 to 1945, when he died shortly after beginning his fourth term. His third term was controversial, said Noah Rosenblum, a legal historian and constitutional law professor at New York University, noting that FDR's tenure broke from a precedent set by George Washington and drew accusations of dictatorial ambitions as well as a disrespect for democracy.",
      "\"There are very few norms as deeply embedded in American democratic culture as the idea that the president serves two terms,\" Rosenblum told CBS News. \"And clever word games to try to get around that are really nothing but attempts to undermine the clear text, spirit and intention of the Constitution and this historical process that ungirds it.\"",
      "Here's what to know about the amendments that regulate how long any one person can remain president.",
      "What is Trump saying about seeking a third term?",
      "Mr. Trump has mentioned staying in office after his current, second term ends on numerous occasions, stretching back to his first administration. On the campaign trail in 2020, he told attendees at a rally in Minden, Nevada, that he believed he would win that year's election against Joe Biden and went on to suggest he could take the White House for a third time afterward.",
      "\"We're going to win four more years in the White House. And then after that, we'll negotiate, right?\" Mr. Trump said at the time. \"Because we're probably, based on the way we were treated, we're probably entitled to another four after that.\" It was unclear at the time if Mr. Trump meant what he said, but the comments stoked national discourse about whether he would, or could, truly attempt to flout the two-term limit.",
      "Those questions began to crop up again after the president's recent remarks to NBC News, in which he said during a phone interview from Mar-a-Lago that he was \"not joking\" about trying to serve a third term in the White House.",
      "\"There are methods which you could do it,\" said Mr. Trump, although he added, \"It is far too early to think about it.\"",
      "When asked by NBC's Kristen Welker about a hypothetical scenario where Vice President JD Vance won the next election and handed the authority back to him, he said that could be one way to end up in office for a third time.",
      "\"But there are others, too. There are others,\" Mr. Trump continued, declining to elaborate when asked.",
      "What does the 22nd Amendment say, exactly?",
      "The opening line of the 22nd Amendment to the Constitution states: \"No person shall be elected to the office of the President more than twice, and no person who has held the office of President, or acted as President, for more than two years of a term to which some other person was elected President shall be elected to the office of the President more than once.\"",
      "The latter portion of that section means that if the vice president takes over the presidency if an elected president dies, for example, and serves in that role for more than half of the originally elected president's term, then they could only serve one more presidential term after that. The former restricts an individual to two four-year terms of service as president, applying to consecutive and non-consecutive terms.",
      "Addressing remarks by some, like constitutional law scholar Lawrence Tribe, who has observed that the amendment as written merely prevents a sitting president from being elected, but not serving, more than twice, Rosenblum said the language \"reinforces the intention of the amendment, which is not to prevent someone from being elected president twice, it's to make sure nobody serves more than two terms as president.\"",
      "\"The language of the 22nd Amendment is framed in terms of the language of 'election,' but the purpose of the amendment is clear,\" Rosenblum told CBS News. \"It's to ensure that the office of the president transfers and cycles as part of the democratic process.\"",
      "Why was the 22nd Amendment ratified?",
      "Congress proposed the 22nd Amendment in 1947 in response to critiques of FDR's presidency, which ended with Roosevelt's death in April 1945, a few months into his fourth term.",
      "The National Constitution Center notes that Republicans who had long opposed FDR found allies among some Democrats from the South and West to get the proposal passed through Congress and sent to the states for ratification. The 22nd Amendment was ratified in 1951.",
      "Harry Truman, who was Roosevelt's vice president, stepped in as president in 1945 and was subsequently elected to fulfill another term in office when that one concluded. Truman opted not to run again in 1952.",
      "What about the 12th Amendment?",
      "The 12th Amendment preceded the 22nd by well over a century but even then it included a provision about who is and is not eligible to run for president and vice president. This amendment was introduced by federal legislators in 1803 and ratified about six months later, in 1804, taking effect in time for the year's presidential election that saw Thomas Jefferson assume office.",
      "It primarily focuses on the processes through which the Electoral College votes to elect a U.S. president and vice president,\u00a0the National Constitution Center writes. However, the amendment also states that \"no person constitutionally ineligible to the office of President shall be eligible to that of Vice-President of the United States.\"",
      "That would mean Mr. Trump could not run for vice president on the ticket of another presidential candidate after finishing his second term in office if the 22nd Amendment's provisions prevent him from running for president.",
      "Is there a way Trump could serve a third term?",
      "Rosenblum said Mr. Trump's ability to serve a third term could come down to how the courts interpret the 12th and 22nd Amendments. He pointed out that even those committed to more literal application of the Constitution tend to interpret the language \"with an eye toward what the real purpose is.\"",
      "In this case, he said, that would be upholding the term limits it has laid out. Still, Rosenblum cautioned, \"a president who's interested in remaining in power, despite limits against it, will come up with clever legal arguments to do so.\"",
      "\"This is an administration that has repeatedly shown itself contemptuous of the rule of law,\" said Rosenblum. \"So, will Trump be able to violate the law and remain in office indefinitely? Only if the American people let him.\"",
      "Asked about Mr. Trump's comments and whether the president could get a third term, Senate Majority Leader John Thune said, \"Not without a change in the Constitution.\"",
      "He added, \"I think that you guys [reporters] keep asking the question and \u2026 I think he is having some fun with it, probably messing with you.\"",
      "Other legal scholars who have weighed in on the subject say they doubt Mr. Trump could manage to usurp the amendments and their long-held rules of law.",
      "\"I don't think there's any 'one weird trick' to getting around presidential term limits,\" Derek Muller, a professor of election law at Notre Dame, told the Associated Press.",
      "Muller suggested Mr. Trump has mentioned running for a third term \"to show as much strength as possible,\" adding that \"a lame-duck president like Donald Trump has every incentive in the world to make it seem like he's not a lame duck.\"",
      "All told, the question of Mr. Trump continuing as president past January 2029 is \"incredibly complicated,\" said Michael Dorf, a constitutional law scholar and Cornell University professor whose blog series, \"Wait, Can He Actually Do That?,\" analyzes the latest actions by the administration when one \"seemingly exceeds the president's authority.\"",
      "Dorf has identified two main reasons for the complexity.",
      "\"One, is that our system for electing presidents is complicated, even in normal times,\" he told CBS News. \"But it's also complicated because, ultimately, no legal system can work if people are acting in constant bad faith. There has to be some sort of willingness of people to accept defeat, or to give the law a sensible meaning. And Trump has shown repeatedly that if it disfavors him, he's going to ignore longstanding norms.\"",

      "Trump supporters like former strategist Steve Bannon have called on the president to run again, and Rep. Andy Ogles, a Tennessee Republican, introduced a resolution earlier this year to amend the Constitution to allow Mr. Trump to be elected to another term. Senate Majority Leader John Thune also said of Mr. Trump's prospects of serving a third term, \"not without a change in the Constitution.\" He told reporters, \"I think that you guys keep asking the question and \u2026 I think he is having some fun with it, probably messing with you.\"",
      "Experts say changing the Constitution is extremely unlikely. Election law scholars\u00a0raised the possibility that talk of a third term, whatever its likelihood, may function as a show of strength to try to stave off the perception that Mr. Trump is a lame-duck president.",
      "Here's a timeline of Mr. Trump's comments on a third term:",
      "\"We're probably entitled to another four after that\"",
      "Mr. Trump flirted with additional time in office beyond two terms when he sought reelection in 2020. During a rally in Minden, Nevada, the president predicted he would win four more years in the White House, and even suggested that he could go on to another term after his second.",
      "\"We're going to win four more years in the White House. And then after that, we'll negotiate, right?\" Mr. Trump said. \"Because we're probably, based on the way we were treated, we're probably entitled to another four after that.\"",
      "\"Am I allowed to run again?\"",
      "Shortly after returning to office, Mr. Trump again made reference to another term at a rally in Las Vegas on Jan. 25.",
      "\"It will be the greatest honor of my life to serve, not once but twice \u2014 or three times or four times,\" Mr. Trump quipped to applause from the crowd, before adding that \"no, it will be to serve twice.\"",
      "Then on Jan. 27, Mr. Trump joked to Republican lawmakers about a third term. Speaking before the House GOP conference in Florida, Mr. Trump touted the money he'd raised for another race that he said \"I assume I can't use for myself.\"",
      "\"But I'm not 100% sure because, I don't know,\" the president continued, to laughter from House Republicans. \"I think I'm not allowed to run again. I'm not sure. Am I allowed to run again?\"",
      "\"Should I run again? You tell me.\"",
      "At the National Prayer Breakfast on Feb. 6, Mr. Trump said, \"They say I can't run again \u2014 that's the expression.\"",
      "\"Then somebody said, 'I don't think you can.' Oh,\" the president added.",
      "On Feb. 20, the president again joked about an additional term at a White House event to mark Black History Month, as he celebrated the support he saw from Black Americans in the 2024 election.",
      "\"Should I run again? You tell me,\" Mr. Trump said, as supporters chanted, \"four more years!\"",
      "\"There are methods\"",
      "In an interview with NBC's Kristen Welker on March 30, Mr. Trump said, \"I'm not joking\" about serving a third term, and for the first time mentioned an awareness of potential paths.",
      "\"There are methods which you could do it,\" Mr. Trump said in a phone interview, adding that \"it is far too early to think about it.\"",
      "The president pointed to his favorability rating and suggested that Americans would like him to serve a third term. Mr. Trump told Welker, \"I have had more people say, 'please run again,'\" while noting \"we have a long way to go before we even think about that.\" On Air Force One Sunday night, he\u00a0spoke\u00a0with reporters and briefly addressed questions about a third term and reiterated that it's still a distant consideration.",
      "\"No matter how you look at it, we've got a long time to go. We have a long time. You know, we have almost four years to go,\" Mr. Trump told reporters. \"But despite that, so many people are saying, 'you've got to run again.' They love the job.\"",
      "While speaking to reporters on Monday in the Oval Office, Mr. Trump denied that he has ever looked into running for another term.",
      "\"People are asking me to run,\" he said. \"There's a whole story about running for a third term. I don't know. I never looked into it. They do say there's a way you can do it. But I don't know about that. But I have not looked into it.\"",

    "published": "Mon, 31 Mar 2025 12:51:00 -0400",
    "summary": "These automakers are the most and least exposed to President Trump's sweeping tariffs on automobiles.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration's 25% tariffs on vehicles and auto parts imported into the U.S. could lead to sticker shock for American consumers, including for those buying cars manufactured domestically, analysts say.",
      "Few vehicle manufacturers will be spared by the fresh levies, which are aimed at revitalizing domestic automobile manufacturing. Industry analysts say the tax will surely raise car prices in the U.S. and squeeze some would-be car buyers out of the market.",
      "Some manufacturers could move a share of production to the U.S., but it would come \"at the expense of reduced competition, higher prices, and significantly lower production in the U.S.'s main trading partners,\" Oxford Economics analyst Abby Stamp said in a research note.",
      "The automobile supply chain is highly complex and intertwined with the economies of Mexico and Canada, from which American brands source finished vehicles and parts. Mr. Trump's tariff on passenger cars and light trucks imported into the U.S. will go into effect April 3, according to the executive order, and a 25% tariff on auto parts shipped from foreign countries goes into effect \"no later than May 3.\"",
      "The price of a typical car could rise by between $5,000 to $10,000 \"out of the gates\" due to the new tariffs, according to a March 31 estimate from Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives.",
      "Meanwhile, car insurance premiums are also likely to jump because the tariffs will make it more expensive to repair vehicles, partly due to higher costs for purchasing new auto parts.",
      "Average insurance premiums could rise to $2,759, or a 19% bump from the typical cost in the fourth quarter of 2024, according to a new projection from Insurify. That increase would come after car insurance costs jumped 11% in February from a year earlier, making it one of the fastest-rising components in the Consumer Price Index (CPI), which measures inflation.",
      "While all car manufacturers will be impacted by the new tariffs, according to analysts, some will be hit much harder than others.",
      "Tesla",
      "Tesla CEO Elon Musk, a close ally of Mr. Trump, posted on X Wednesday that the new tariffs would affect the company's American-made electric vehicles.",
      "\"Important to note that Tesla is NOT unscathed here. The tariff impact on Tesla is still significant,\" Musk wrote on X Wednesday. \"To be clear, this will affect the price of parts in Tesla cars that come from other countries. The cost impact is not trivial,\" he wrote in a later post.",
      "That said, Tesla is expected to be among the automakers that are least affected by the tariffs, given that its vehicles are made in the U.S., and most of their parts are sourced domestically, too. The EV brand does, however, rely on China for some batteries, \"so the tariffs will have an impact,\" Art Wheaton, a transportation industry expert and director of labor studies at Cornell's School of Industrial and Labor Relations, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Tesla rival Rivian could also be spared for similar reasons, according to UBS.",
      "\"We believe TSLA and RIVN could fare better as 100% of their production is in the U.S. (though not all components),\" UBS analysts said in a research note.",
      "General Motors",
      "General Motors, one of the so-called Big Three automakers, along with Stellantis and Ford, is widely expected to be the most exposed to the forthcoming auto tariffs. Headquartered in Detroit, the U.S. car company makes just 45% of vehicles it sells to U.S. customers domestically, leaving 55% of its lineup exposed to tariffs, according to Cox Automotive.",
      "GM, which makes Chevrolet, Buick, GMC and Cadillac vehicles, is heavily invested in Mexico and Canada, where it builds heavy-duty vehicles, according to Cornell's Wheaton.",
      "Stellantis",
      "Stellantis, whose brands include Jeep, Chrysler, Dodge and Ram, among others, is similarly susceptible to rising costs from the tariffs, as it makes between 73%-75% of vehicles for sale in the U.S. stateside, according to Cox Automotive.",
      "That means an $80,000 RAM truck from Stellantis could cost $100,000 once it reaches the U.S., under the new policy.",
      "\"The impact is quite large,\" Wheaton said.",
      "Ford",
      "Ford is among the car companies better positioned to weather the tariffs, according to Cox Automotive analyst Erin Keating, as 80% of its vehicles are manufactured in the U.S. and therefore would not be subject to the 25% tariff on passenger cars. However, any imported parts used in Ford's U.S.-manufactured vehicles could be tariffed at 25%.",
      "Ford vehicles made in the U.S. include the F-150 pickup truck lineup. Some of its smaller vehicles, including the Maverick pickup truck and Bronco Sport SUV are made in Mexico and \"will take a hit,\" said Wheaton.",
      "While domestic automakers will face increased costs, it's unclear how much of the tax they'll pass along to consumers. The\u00a0Wall Street Journal,\u00a0reported that Mr. Trump warned the CEOs of the Big Three not to raise car prices because of tariffs, according to people familiar with the matter.",
      "Toyota and Honda",
      "Japanese automakers Toyota and Honda export a large number of vehicles and auto parts from Japan to the U.S., which represents a sizable market for the companies. Both also operate big plants in Canada, Wheaten noted, leaving them particularly vulnerable to added costs from new tariffs.",
      "The same goes for South Korean automakers Hyundai and Kia.",
      "BMW and Volkswagen",
      "German automakers, including BMW and Volkswagen, which makes Audi vehicles, both operate big plants in Mexico.",
      "The May 3 auto-parts tariff will likely apply to engines and transmission systems, and hit the company \"heavily,\" according to Wheaton.",
      "BMW, for instance, makes a lot of engines in Germany, which it then ships to South Carolina, where the automaker manufactures SUVs. The company could be hit \"heavily,\" by the auto-parts tariffs, according to Wheaton.",
      "Mercedes-Benz operates similarly, sending engines and transmissions from Germany to a plant in Alabama, where the company manufactures SUVs. The 25% auto tariffs would also likely apply to fully assembled Mercedes vehicles shipped to the U.S.",
      "\"I don't think any brands will be spared, because none are 100% in the U.S.,\" Wheaton said. \"They all have products from Canada, Mexico or elsewhere. And even Tesla, which is the most American, still has non-U.S. content in their vehicles.\"",
      "Tariffs could spark affordability issues",
      "Even vehicles whose parts aren't subject to tariffs and that are assembled in the U.S. could face price hikes, as automakers attempt to spread new costs out across their lineups. While Cox Automotive expects price hikes of between 15-20% on vehicles that are caught in the tariffs' crosshairs, those that are exempt could still go up by about 5%, Keating noted.",
      "The auto tariffs could ignite new affordability challenges for consumers by moving lower-cost vehicles closer to, or in some cases over the $30,000 threshold.",
      "Take, for example, a Hyundai Venue, a subcompact crossover SUV, with an average current list price of $24,000. Under Mr. Trump's auto tariffs, that price could rise to about $28,500, adding more than $4,000 to an affordable design.",
      "\"Sub- $30,000 compact SUVs and crossovers that are the most popular are almost all foreign-made, with the exception of one or two,\" Keating said. \"So they'd all be subjected to the 25% tariffs.\"",
      "At the other end of the economic spectrum, luxury Italian car maker Ferrari on Thursday said it would hike prices on certain car models by 10% after April 1, citing Mr. Trump's auto tariffs. The vehicles subject to price increase include the Ferrari 296, SF90 and Roma, which already retail for hundreds of thousands of dollars each.",

    "published": "Mon, 31 Mar 2025 12:21:51 -0400",
    "summary": "Here's what to know about tariffs ahead of President Trump's plans to announce new import duties on April 2.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration is planning to impose a round of fresh tariffs on April 2, a day President Trump has dubbed \"Liberation Day.\" The announcement is viewed by economists as the culmination of his \"America First Trade Policy,\" an\u00a0executive order he signed on his first day in office aimed at revitalizing U.S. manufacturing.",
      "Mr. Trump has referred to his April 2 tariff announcement as \"the big one,\" suggesting that the plans may be more far reaching than the import levies he's already unleashed on goods from other nations, such as his March 26 declaration of 25% tariffs on vehicles and auto parts imported into the\u00a0U.S.",
      "\"For DECADES we have been ripped off and abused by every nation in the World, both friend and foe. Now it is finally time for the Good Ol' USA to get some of that MONEY, and RESPECT, BACK. GOD BLESS AMERICA!!!\" Trump said about his April 2 plans in a post\u00a0earlier this month on Truth Social.",
      "On April 2, Mr. Trump is expected to announce his administration's plans for so-called reciprocal tariffs, which he deems necessary to erase trade imbalances with nations that export more goods to the U.S. than they import from America. But the addition of broad-based tariffs to a host of imports is likely to heat up a global trade war that could, at least in the short term, boost prices for U.S. consumers and juice inflation.",
      "\"Tariffs are a tax on imported goods, and research shows that that majority gets passed along to consumers,\" Colin Grabow, associate director of the Herbert A. Stiefel Center for trade policy studies at the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Ultimately, the Trump administration's goal is to increase prices on imports to the point where it's economically favorable for companies to relocate their manufacturing to the U.S., he noted.",
      "\"If prices don't go up, it doesn't deter imports, and therefore there is no reason to set up shop in the U.S.,\" Grabow explained. \"Part of the logic is premised on prices going up, otherwise they are not going to accomplish their goal.\"",
      "Economists say that Mr. Trump's tariff agenda, including the uncertainty surrounding it, could drag down U.S. GDP by depressing financial markets and consumer sentiment.",
      "\"The main channel from trade policy uncertainty to GDP is via business investment. Under higher trade policy uncertainty, future revenue streams of an investment become more uncertain, raising the option value of delaying investment decisions until the situation is clearer,\" Oxford Economics analysts said in a research note.",
      "What tariffs will Trump announce April 2?",
      "Mr. Trump teased his April 2 announcement on Wednesday when he announced his new 25% tariffs on foreign-made cars and auto parts. \"That's Liberation Day, that's gonna be on the 2nd, and that's gonna be reciprocal, and I think people will be impressed,\" the president said.",
      "Reciprocal tariffs are designed to match the import duties placed on U.S. goods and services by other nations, as well as compensate for other trade barriers, according to the Yale Budget Lab, a non-partisan public policy think tank. According to a White House memo from Feb. 13, the U.S. faces additional trade barriers aside from tariffs such as regulatory requirements that can make it more difficult for American exports to reach other nations.",
      "While the size and scope of the reciprocal tariffs that Mr. Trump plans to announce are unknown, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent last week said the administration's reciprocal tariffs would target countries with the biggest trade surpluses, as well as those which have imposed the highest tariffs plus non-tariff trade barriers on U.S. goods.",
      "Multiple nations run large annual trade surpluses with the U.S., including Germany, Ireland and Italy in the European Union, as well as Vietnam, Japan and Taiwan. The U.S. also has a large trade deficit with China, although Mr. Trump has already imposed new tariffs on that nation.",
      "\"It'll be in many cases less than the tariff that they've been charging us for decades ... I think we're trying to keep it somewhat conservative,\" Mr. Trump said on March 26.",
      "Mr. Trump added that he'll introduce a reciprocal tariff policy on \"all countries,\" which he said would be \"very lenient.\"",
      "On Sunday, National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett told Fox News' Maria Bartiromo that there are 15 countries \"that we have massive, massive trade deficits with,\" but that Mr. Trump will ultimately decided how many countries will be subject to new tariffs Wednesday.",
      "Mr. Hassett also promoted tariffs as an effective tool for reshoring manufacturing to the U.S., saying \"it's going to be a boom,\" referring to auto manufacturing in particular.",
      "Meanwhile, additional tariffs are also slated to go into effect on April 2, with Mr. Trump's one-month delay on 25% tariffs on Canadian and Mexican imports set to expire that day. The 25% auto tariff announced by the president on March 26 is also scheduled to take effect on April 2.",
      "What are reciprocal tariffs?",
      "Reciprocal tariffs enacted by the U.S. would match foreign nations' levies and other trade policies on American goods.",
      "A reciprocal tariff policy would include calculating a country-specific number that the Trump administration deems representative of all trade barriers. But import restrictions other than tariffs, such as regulatory requirements, could be hard to quantify, economists say.",
      "\"There are a lot of intangibles, like testing regulations for different products in countries, or perceived openness to business with American companies,\" Simon Macadam, deputy chief global economist at Capital Economics, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"These are things you can't easily put a number on.\"",
      "Because of this complexity, some experts expect Trump's reciprocal tariffs could be more limited in scope, and might not be truly \"reciprocal\" because they may not exactly match other countries' levies.",
      "\"We shouldn't be surprised if some of the stuff is rolled back, or not as sweeping as maybe originally talked about, because logistically, from a practical perspective, running the calculations and coming up with a number is extremely time consuming,\" Grabow of the Cato Institute said.",
      "Wilbur Ross, who served as the U.S. Secretary of Commerce during the first Trump administration, agreed that a truly reciprocal tariff policy would be \"very complicated to get to work.\"",
      "\"If you were literally going to be reciprocal, you would put the same tariff on a product that comes into the U.S. as that country charges on products from the U.S.,\" he said. \"But the problem is you'd be charging a different tariff on the same item from different countries.\"",
      "That would create loopholes for exporters to ship products through lower-tariffed countries to the U.S., Ross added. \"It would make it easy for people to game the system,\" he said.",
      "What does Trump want to achieve?",
      "Through his \"Fair and Reciprocal Plan\" on trade, Mr. Trump is aiming to bring about three outcomes: Boost U.S. manufacturing jobs; close the $1.2 trillion U.S. trade deficit; and gain leverage over U.S. trade partners.",
      "But experts say that trade barriers such as tariffs may not be enough to revitalize U.S. manufacturing jobs, which have fallen sharply over the last few decades. Fewer than 13 million people are employed in manufacturing today, down from a peak of 19.6 million in 1979,\u00a0according to federal data.",
      "\"To a large extent, and particularly in low- and medium-tech industries, the economics of production will not be significantly altered by a 10-20% tariff,\" Macadam said. \"When labor costs in hubs like Mexico are one-fifth of what they are in the U.S., in order to induce companies to seriously relocate a lot of production back to the U.S. a 20% tariff isn't going to cut it.\"",
      "There's also the unknown of how long any new tariffs announced by Mr. Trump will remain in place. Such uncertainty could deter American or foreign businesses from investing heavily in re-shoring manufacturing to the U.S.",
      "\"Even if for some companies it gets to the point where it seems to make financial sense to move back to the U.S., there's the question of, 'Are these tariffs actually going to last a long time?'\" Macadam said. \"If you think the tariff is going to be there forever, then yeah, absolutely relocate. But if it's reversed or rates are lowered, then it would have been silly to relocate.\"",
      "What will tariffs mean for consumers?",
      "Consumers typically pay the price for tariffs, as companies have said they plan on passing off much of the costs to their customers.",
      "As a result, a round of fresh tariffs could boost inflation, economists say. According to an analysis by Oxford Economics, if the effective tariff rate on imports into the U.S. rises from their 2024 level of 2.5% to 10% in April, which is what Oxford Economics expects, prices in aggregate would rise by half a percentage point.",

    "story": [
      "A unanimous Wisconsin Supreme Court on Sunday refused to hear a last-minute attempt by the state's Democratic attorney general to stop billionaire Elon Musk from handing over\u00a0$1 million checks to two voters, a ruling that came just minutes before the start of the rally.",
      "Two lower courts had already rejected the legal challenge\u00a0by Democrat Josh Kaul, who argues that Musk's offer violates a state law. \"Wisconsin law prohibits offering anything of value to induce anyone to vote,\" Kaul argued in his filing. \"Yet, Elon Musk did just that.\"",
      "But the state Supreme Court, which is currently controlled 4-3 by liberal justices, declined to take the case as an original action. The court gave no rationale for its decision.",
      "Taking the stage in Green Bay wearing a yellow foam cheesehead hat, Musk gave out $1 million checks on Sunday to two Wisconsin voters, declaring them spokespeople for his political group. One of the recipients, Nicholas Jacobs, is listed as the chairman of the Wisconsin Federation of College Republicans.",
      "Musk painted the judicial race he has pumped more than $20 million into as pivotal for the country.",
      "Noting the likelihood the state high court will take up redistricting that could give Democrats a chance at winning two additional U.S. House seats, Musk said, \"The House majority is now razor thin.\"",
      "\"And if the (Wisconsin) Supreme Court is able to redraw the districts, they will gerrymander the district and deprive Wisconsin of two seats on the Republican side,\" Musk said. \"Then they will try to stop all the government reforms we are getting done, for you the American people.\"",
      "Wisconsin's tightly contested Supreme Court election, where ideological control of the court is at stake, is on Tuesday. The race, with the assist from Musk, has become the most expensive judicial election in American history, with more than $81 million in spending.",
      "Liberals currently hold a 4-3 majority. But five of the court's seven justices have endorsed a candidate in the race, raising potential conflicts for them to hear the Musk lawsuit.",
      "The court's liberal justices have endorsed Dane County Judge Susan Crawford, the Democratic-backed candidate. One of the court's conservative justices has endorsed Waukesha County Judge Brad Schimel, who also has the backing of President Trump and Musk. Schimel wore a \"Make America Great Again Hat\" while campaigning Sunday.",
      "\"That's exactly what I've committed to anybody, whether it's President Trump, Elon Musk or any donors and donors or supporters or voters in Wisconsin. That's my commitment,\" Schimel told \"Fox News Sunday.\"",
      "It's unclear whether Schimel attended the rally.",
      "Crawford's campaign declined to comment on Kaul's legal filing, and Kaul had no immediate comment on the court's order.",
      "\"Wisconsin law prohibits offering anything of value to induce anyone to vote,\" Kaul had argued in his filing. \"Yet, Elon Musk did just that.\"",
      "Musk's political action committee used a nearly identical tactic before the presidential election last year, offering to pay $1 million a day to voters in Wisconsin and six other battleground states who signed a petition supporting the First and Second Amendments. A judge in Pennsylvania said prosecutors failed to show the effort was an illegal lottery and allowed it to continue through Election Day.",
      "Musk on Friday initially said in a post on his social media platform, X, that he planned to \"personally hand over\" $2 million to a pair of voters who have already cast their ballots in the race.",
      "Musk later posted a clarification, saying the money would go to people who will be \"spokesmen\" for an online petition against \"activist\" judges. After first saying the event would only be open to people who had voted in the Supreme Court race, he said attendance would be limited to those who have signed the petition.",
      "Also on Friday, Musk's political action committee identified the recipient of its first $1 million giveaway \u2014 a Green Bay man who had donated to the Wisconsin GOP and the conservative candidate in the court race, and who has a history of posting support for Trump and his agenda.",
      "The judicial election comes as Wisconsin's highest court is expected to rule on abortion rights, congressional redistricting, union power and voting rules that could affect the 2026 midterms and the 2028 presidential election in the state.",
      "There will also be congressional elections held Tuesday in Florida that have attracted big fundraising. Florida's 6th District was vacated when National Security Adviser Mike Waltz joined Mr. Trump's Cabinet, and the 1st District was held by former Rep. Matt Gaetz, who resigned to join the Trump administration as Attorney General. He eventually withdrew his name from consideration, but he had already vacated his seat. Both districts voted for Mr. Trump by 30 points or more, but Democrats have dominated fundraising.",

    "published": "Mon, 31 Mar 2025 07:16:00 -0400",
    "summary": "The Trump administration has targeted international students in wake of pro-Palestinian protests and other activities.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Trump administration's crackdown on students who participated in pro-Palestinian activities has\u00a0raised questions about the First Amendment rights of visa and green card holders amid the shocking detentions of a number of students at Tufts, Columbia and other universities in recent weeks.",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio cited a provision in the Immigration and Nationality Act that authorizes the nation's top diplomat to revoke the visas of foreign national students on the grounds that their presence or activities have \"potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences\" for the U.S.",
      "The federal government is not required to lay out proof beyond that explanation, legal experts told CBS News, setting up a legal showdown over foreign nationals' free speech rights in the U.S.",
      "\"There's a tension between everyone's First Amendment rights to free speech and the immigration statute's broad provisions giving the secretary of state broad latitude to declare someone deportable simply because he thinks that the student may have potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences. And the courts will have to figure out where the appropriate line should be drawn,\" said Stephen Yale-Loehr, a retired immigration law professor at Cornell University.",
      "Rubio said Thursday the State Department has canceled more than 300 visas and that they're \"primarily\" student visas. Several high-profile cases are related to students who led or participated in pro-Palestinian activities and disruptive protests, which the administration has equated to activity supporting Hamas, a U.S.-designated terrorist group.",
      "He also told reporters that if the administration is compelled to provide evidence in court, it will, but said \"judges don't issue student visas. There's no right to a student visa.\"",
      "\"We gave you a visa to come and study and get a degree, not to become a social activist that tears up our university campuses. And if we've given you a visa, and then you decide to do that, we're going to take it away,\" Rubio said at a news conference in Guyana.",
      "In targeting students, the Trump administration is enforcing the statute differently than past administrations, according to immigration lawyer Jonathan Grode.",
      "\"This administration hasn't changed the law,\" Grode said. \"They're just telling the referees to call the game differently. They're saying, be stricter, use all the tools you have available to effectuate this behavior. That's the big difference. That's why it feels so jarring.\"",
      "\"With the Trump administration, they're pushing this to such a degree that it's creating concern, hysteria, reaction, litigation,\" he added.",
      "A visa revocation does not automatically result in a person's deportation, which is handled by the Department of Homeland Security and requires due process. Several of the students are sitting in detention facilities as the government seeks to deport them.",
      "Rubio's remarks came in response to a question about Tufts University graduate student Rumeysa Ozturk, a Fulbright scholar and Turkish national who was taken into custody by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents wearing masks and in plain clothes in Massachusetts on Tuesday, March 25.",
      "A Department of Homeland Security spokesperson alleged Wednesday that Ozturk had \"engaged in activities in support of Hamas,\" but did not provide details about her alleged activities. Ozturk's friends have said she is being punished for co-authoring an opinion piece in the Tufts Daily campus newspaper in 2024, where she called on the school to divest from Israel and \"acknowledge the Palestinian genocide\" but never mentioned Hamas.",
      "The case followed another high-profile detention earlier this month of Mahmoud Khalil, a Columbia University grad student who had been active in pro-Palestinian protests on campus last year. Khalil, who was born in a Palestinian refugee camp in Syria, has a green card, or legal permanent residency, and his wife is an American citizen. Immigration authorities initially told Khalil that they were acting on a State Department order to revoke his student visa, but when they were informed that he had a green card, the agent said they were revoking that according to his attorney.",
      "Green cards, however, cannot be rescinded as simply as visas. The government suggested in a court filing earlier this week that it could move to revoke his status for allegedly omitting information on his immigration forms, including his involvement with the United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees, known as UNRWA, and a group known as Columbia University Apartheid Divest.",
      "But at the core of the U.S. government's detention and aimed deportation of Khalil is a rarely used section of the Immigration and Nationality Act that subjects noncitizens to possible deportation if their presence and activities are deemed threatening to the foreign policy interests of the U.S.",
      "This same law was used to detain Georgetown University researcher Badar Khan Suri, an Indian national who was taken into custody by masked agents March 17 in Virginia. The government cited his alleged \"close connections\" to a Hamas official as justification for revoking the visa, saying he was \"actively spreading Hamas propaganda.\"",
      "The government using that law is also trying to deport Yunseo Chung, a 21-year-old Columbia University student and legal permanent resident who has been involved in pro-Palestinian protests. Chung came to the U.S. from South Korea with her family when she was 7.",
      "Yale-Loehr recalled two other cases where similar powers were invoked in deportation proceedings. In 1987, it was used in a case involving eight people who either held valid student visas or were lawful permanent residents for their pro-Palestinian activism. The deportation case dragged on for 20 years and ended with a judge calling the government's actions \"an embarrassment to the rule of law.\" In the 1990s, the government tried to deport a former Mexican official who was in the U.S. on a visa and faced charges in his home country. The then secretary of state said his deportation was necessary for foreign policy matters.",
      "Attorneys in the recent cases have accused the Trump administration of using immigration enforcement to suppress speech it disagrees with.",
      "Grode said the crackdown could have a chilling effect on the First Amendment. The Trump administration, which ran on a free speech platform, is \"creeping in on attacking some of the very fundamental principles that make America America,\" he said. Still, noncitizens having First Amendment rights \"doesn't negate the ability of the government to revoke their visa,\" he added.",
      "Yale-Loehr expects it will take years for these cases to be settled, predicting that \"it's going to be a mess.\"",
      "\"If there's over 300 students who had their visas revoked, there's going to be a lot of cases challenging it,\" he said. \"I suspect that the litigation will take years to unravel before a court and get a definitive ruling on the extent to which foreign nationals have First Amendment rights.\"",

The confirmed death toll has continued to rise since the disaster, reaching at least 2,056 on Monday, according to the French news agency AFP citing the ruling military junta in the country.",
      "The number of deaths is likely to rise further, as many parts of the country have been cut off. Getting help to those in need \u2014 and even assessing the extent of the destruction \u2014 has proved difficult in a country where key infrastructure was badly damaged and where a civil war had already been raging before the 7.7 magnitude quake struck on Friday. There have been significant aftershocks in its wake.",
      "The occasional rescue may have helped to keep hope alive over the weekend, but they were the lucky ones.",
      "Building after building in Myanmar's second largest city, Mandalay, and beyond lie in ruins. Damaged roads, bridges and downed powerlines have made it impossible for rescue teams to reach many communities in the impoverished nation that's been engulfed by war since the junta seized power in a coup four years ago.",
      "Just hours after the big quake struck on Friday, there were reports the junta had carried out airstrikes in rebel-controlled areas that were impacted by the temblor, compounding the misery for survivors.",
      "In neighboring Thailand, the quake was felt strongly in capital Bangkok, but only one large building completely collapsed. Thai authorities have ordered an investigation into that isolated collapse to determine whether it could have been due to inadequate building materials, design flaws or a failure in the inspections process.",
      "The junta has maintained its strict controls on foreign journalists entering Myanmar but has appealed for international aid. As of Monday, China, Russia and India had responded with humanitarian supplies and rescue and recovery teams on the ground, along with other regional neighbors.",

      "Lehder, one of the original \"cocaine cowboys\" and Pablo Escobar's crime partner, was arrested Friday night shortly after he landed in Bogota's airport on a flight from Germany, with immigration officials saying he was still wanted in the South American country on drug trafficking charges and weapons smuggling.",
      "Lehder became the first Colombian drug trafficker extradited to the United States after he was arrested during a party at his ranch.",
      "The former drug trafficker was extradited to the U.S. in 1987, where he served more than 30 years in prison. In 2020, Lehder was released after serving two-thirds of his U.S. sentence. He was\u00a0deported to Germany, where he is also a citizen.",

      "Colombian authorities convicted Lehder for drug trafficking in 1995, while he was serving the separate sentence at a U.S. prison. The cartel boss was sentenced to 24 years in prison in Colombia, meaning his sentence expired in 2019, according to Colombian law.",
      "The son of a German immigrant who arrived in Colombia in the 1920s, Lehder began his criminal career in the 1970s when he lived with relatives in New York City.",

    "story": [
      "Marine Le Pen, the figurehead of the ascendant far-right political movement in France, was hit with a non-custodial prison sentence and barred from running in elections for five years on Monday as a court found her guilty of embezzling European Union funds to pay members of her National Rally party's staff. In handing down the sentence, the judge said the public office ban would take effect immediately.",
      "\"The court took into consideration, in addition to the risk of reoffending, the major disturbance of public order if a person already convicted ... was a candidate in the presidential election,\" judge Benedicte de Perthuis, was quoted as saying by the French news agency AFP.",
      "De Perthuis also sentenced Le Pen to four years in prison but said that part of her sentence would be served as house arrest, with her wearing an electronic tag, not in a prison. The judge suspended two of the four years of the prison sentence. He also fined her more than $100,000.",
      "Le Pen, speaking to French TV channel TF1 in her first reaction to the verdict, said she would appeal and called the ruling a \"political\" move aimed at preventing her from running in the 2027 presidential election.",
      "She said the court should not have made her ineligible to run for office until all her chances at appeal had been exhausted.",
      "\"If that's not a political decision, I don't know what is,\" she said.",
      "Le Pen would remain ineligible to be a candidate until the appeal is decided, but the house arrest and fine would be suspended during the appeals process.",
      "Le Pen said she would ask that the court proceedings take place before the 2027 campaign. Only an appellate ruling that overturns the ban on public office could restore her hopes of running. But, there's no guarantee that an appeals court would rule more favorably, and appeals in France can take several years to conclude.",
      "Rodolphe Bosselut, Le Pen's lawyer, said he was \"appalled\" by the court's decision, calling it \"extremely scandalous.\" He also vowed to launch an appeal against the guilty verdict.",
      "Recent polling has shown Le Pen likely would have won at least a first round in France's next national election, though it is much less clear how she would have fared in a second round against a more moderate candidate.",
      "Far-right political figures across Europe \u2014 including the Netherlands' Geert Wilders and Italy's Matteo Salvini\u00a0\u2014 condemned the verdict Monday.",
      "In Russia, meanwhile, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov claimed Le Pen's sentencing was evidence of European nations \"going down the path of trampling over democratic norms.\"",
      "\"Of course, we do not want to interfere in France's internal affairs, we have never done so, and this is France's internal affair,\" said Peskov, \"but in general, our observations of European capitals show that they are not at all reluctant to go beyond democracy during the political process.\"",
      "Le Pen, 56, garnered 41% of the ballots in the last French presidential election in 2022 \u2014 beaten decisively by current President Emmanuel Macron \u2014 and she has made no secret of her desire to run again for the nation's highest office.",
      "Sat in the front row of the Paris court, Le Pen whispered \"incredible\" as the judge detailed his reasoning for the guilty verdict. She walked out of the court before the sentences were announced.",
      "Le Pen, along with eight current or former party members, had faced up to 10 years in prison on the embezzlement charges. A dozen others who served as parliamentary aides for the National Rally party, formerly the National Front, also received guilty verdicts for their role in the scheme.",
      "The judge said Le Pen and her colleagues did not enrich themselves personally but called the embezzlement \"a democratic bypass\" that duped the French parliament and voters. He said Le Pen was at the center of \"a system\" used to siphon off EU money intended to pay EU parliamentary aides, to instead pay party staff between 2004 and 2016.",
      "Le Pen has denied any wrongdoing, claiming prosecutors were \"only interested\" in barring her from the presidential election. She told La Tribune Dimanche\u00a0newspaper on Sunday, before the verdict was handed down, that the judges had \"the right of life or death over our movement.\"",

I hope that Iran \u2014 and I've written him a letter, saying, 'I hope you're going to negotiate.' Because if we have to go in militarily, it's going to be a terrible thing \u2014 for them.\"",
      "In the interview, Mr. Trump said he believed Iran wanted \"to get that letter,\" adding that \"the other alternative is, we have to do something. Because you can't let them have a nuclear weapon.\"",
      "Iranian media reported that on Wednesday a letter from Mr. Trump was delivered to Tehran by a senior United Arab Emirates diplomat, the French news agency AFP said.",
      "Late last week Iran's state-run media said that no letter had been received from Mr. Trump, and Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi told the French news agency AFP on Friday that Iran would not negotiate with the U.S. while heavy U.S. sanctions against the country remain in place.",

Mr. Trump imposed a wide range of new sanctions on Iran at the time, calling it a policy of \"maximum pressure\" to force Tehran to broker a new deal. That policy has decimated Iran's economy, but there have been no new negotiations between the two sides acknowledged publicly since.",
      "Under the original nuclear deal, Iran was permitted to enrich uranium up to 3.67% purity and maintain a stockpile of no more than 661 pounds at that level. At that purity, uranium can be used for medical, research and other civilian purposes, but not to build a nuclear weapon.",
      "The most recent IAEA report found Iran was enriching more uranium to 60% purity \u2014 much closer to the level required for weapons, which is about 90%, and a level at which it was only confirmed to have started enriching after Mr. Trump pulled the U.S. out of the nuclear agreement. Its stockpile of that highly enriched uranium had risen as of February to about 606 pounds, according to the IAEA report.",

    "story": [
      "The Danish foreign minister scolded the Trump administration on Saturday for its \"tone\" criticizing Denmark and Greenland during Vice President JD Vance's visit to the strategic island.",
      "Vance \u2014 joined by his wife, second lady Usha Vance, national security adviser Mike Waltz, Secretary of Energy Chris Wright and Sen. Mike Lee of Utah \u2014 on Friday visited the Pituffick Space Base, the northernmost U.S. military installation, in Greenland. The trip had been scaled back after an uproar among Greenlanders and Danges who were not consulted about the original itinerary. While there, the vice president blasted Denmark for its handling of the island, saying the U.S. base in Greenland is less secure than it was decades ago because of Denmark's stewardship.",
      "\"There is no amount of bullying, no amount of obfuscating, no amount of confusing the issue,\" Vance said. \"Our message to Denmark is very simple: You have not done a good job by the people of Greenland, you have underinvested in the people of Greenland, and you have underinvested in the security architecture of this incredible, beautiful landmass filled with incredible people. That has to change. And because it hasn't changed, that's why President Trump's policy in Greenland is what it is.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has eyed the semi-autonomous Danish territory\u00a0despite opposition from residents and leaders. The president told NBC News in an interview on Saturday that \"we'll get Greenland,\" saying there's a \"good possibility that we could do it without military force,\" while adding that \"I don't take anything off the table.\"",
      "Earlier Saturday, Danish Foreign Minister Lars L\u00f8kke Rasmussen posted a video on social media scolding the Trump administration, saying his country is already investing more into Arctic security and remains open to more cooperation with the U.S.",
      "\"Many accusations and many allegations have been made. And of course, we are open to criticism,\" Rasmussen said speaking in English. \"But let me be completely honest: we do not appreciate the tone in which it is being delivered. This is not how you speak to your close allies. And I still consider Denmark and the United States to be close allies.\"",
      "Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen also pushed back on Vance's claim that Denmark isn't doing enough for defense in the Arctic, calling her country \"a good and strong ally.\"",
      "Vivian Motzfeldt, Greenland's foreign minister told CBS News she wants cooperation with the U.S., not domination.",
      "\"You just don't take over. You speak and you talk. That's all politics is about,\" she said.",
      "Danish King Frederik X posted on Facebook: \"We live in an altered reality. There should be no doubt that my love for Greenland and my connectedness to the people of Greenland are intact.\"",
      "Hundreds of protesters demonstrated Saturday outside the U.S. Embassy in the Danish capital Copenhagen with some lifting signs saying, \"back off, USA\"\u00a0Danish broadcaster TV2 reported.",
      "L\u00f8kke Rasmussen, in his video, reminded viewers of the 1951 defense agreement between Denmark and the United States. Since 1945, the American military presence in Greenland has decreased from thousands of soldiers over 17 bases and installations on the island, he said, to the remote Pituffik Space Base in the northwest with some 200 soldiers today.",
      "The 1951 agreement \"offers ample opportunity for the United States to have a much stronger military presence in Greenland,\" the foreign minister said. \"If that is what you wish, then let us discuss it.\"",
      "L\u00f8kke Rasmussen added that Denmark has increased its own investment into Arctic defense. In January, Denmark announced 14.6 billion Danish kroner (US$2.1 billion) in financial commitments for Arctic security covering three new naval vessels, long-range drones and satellites.",
      "The second lady was originally scheduled to visit Greenland in an expanded cultural trip this week, and then the vice president\u00a0announced\u00a0Tuesday that he would be joining her for a shorter trip that was more focused on U.S. policy and defense.",

      "Crowds protesting billionaire Elon Musk's purge of the U.S. government under President Trump began amassing outside Tesla dealerships throughout the U.S. and in some cities in Europe on Saturday in the latest attempt to dent the fortune of the world's richest man.",
      "The protesters are trying to escalate a movement targeting Tesla dealerships and vehicles in opposition to Musk's role as the head of the newly created Department of of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, where he's gained access to sensitive data and shuttered entire agencies as he attempts to slash government spending. Most of Musk's estimated $340 billion fortune consists of the stock he holds in the electric vehicle company that he continues to run while also working alongside Mr. Trump.",
      "Earlier protests have been somewhat sporadic. Saturday marked the first attempt to surround all 277 of the automaker's showrooms and service centers in the U.S. in hopes of deepening\u00a0a recent decline in the company's sales.",
      "By early afternoon, crowds ranging from a few dozen to hundreds of protesters had flocked to Tesla locations in New Jersey, Massachusetts, Connecticut, New York, Maryland, Minnesota and the automaker's home state of Texas. Pictures posted on social media accounts showed protesters brandishing signs such as\u00a0\"Honk if you hate Elon\"\u00a0and\u00a0\"Fight the billionaire broligarchy.\"",
      "The Tesla Takedown movement also hoped to rally protestors at more than 230 Tesla locations in other parts of the world. Although the turnouts in Europe weren't as large as the crowds in the U.S., the anti-Musk sentiment was similar.",
      "About two dozen protesters held signs lambasting Musk outside a Tesla dealership in London as passing cars and trucks tooted horns in support.",
      "One of the signs displayed at the London protest showed a photo of Musk next to an image of Adolf Hitler making the Nazi salute \u2014 a\u00a0gesture that Musk has been accused of reprising shortly after Mr. Trump's Jan. 20 inauguration. A person in a tyrannosaurus rex costume held another sign with a picture of Musk's straight-arm gesture that said, \"You thought the Nazis were extinct. Don't buy a Swasticar.\"",
      "\"We just want to get loud, make noise, make people aware of the problems that we're facing,\" said Cam Whitten, an American who showed up at the London protest.",
      "Tesla Takedown was organized by a group of supporters that included disillusioned owners of the automaker's vehicles, celebrities such as actor John Cusack, and at least one Democratic Party lawmaker, Rep. Jasmine Crockett from Dallas.",
      "\"I'm going to keep screaming in the halls of Congress. I just need you all to make sure you all keep screaming in the streets,\" Crockett said during a\u00a0Tesla Takedown organizing call\u00a0held earlier this month.",
      "In New York City, mayoral hopeful and New York state Rep. Zohran Mamdani joined protesters at a Tesla showroom on Saturday.",
      "\"We are here in a moment that demands all of us,\" Mandani told the crowd through a megaphone. \"It demands all of us because the richest man in the world has purchased the president of the United States.\"",
      "Some people opposed to Musk have gone beyond protests and set the automaker's vehicles on fire and committed\u00a0other acts of vandalism that U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi has decried as \"nothing short of domestic terrorism.\" Musk indicated he was dumbfounded by the attacks during a March 20 company meeting and said the vandals should \"stop acting psycho.\"",
      "Crockett and other Tesla Takedown supporters have been stressing the importance for Saturday's protests to remain peaceful.",
      "But police were investigating a fire that destroyed seven Tesla vehicles in northwestern Germany early Saturday morning. It was wasn't immediately clear if the blaze, which was extinguished by firefighters, was related to the Tesla Takedown protests.",
      "There have been vandalisms at Tesla dealerships acrossing the U.S., including fires in Nevada and Missouri, and graffiti at locations in Massachusetts and Maryland, CBS News previously reported.",
      "Since January 2025, incidents targeting Tesla EVs have occurred in at least nine states, according to a joint intelligence bulletin issued by the Department of Homeland Security and FBI and obtained by CBS News.\u00a0Although U.S. intelligence suggests lone actors are behind them, Trump administration officials are promising to crack down on what they say are coordinated attacks.",
      "There have also been reports of vandalism to parked Teslas, making individual owners nervous.",
      "\"My wife cautions me, 'Be careful where you are at with it,'\" Bill Fonte told CBS New York. \"If you don't like the product, don't buy it. But they're going above and beyond, creating panic and concern for normal people like me.\"",
      "A growing number of consumers who bought Tesla vehicles before Musk took over DOGE have been looking to sell or trade in their cars while others have slapped on bumper stickers seeking to distance themselves from the billionaire's efforts to prune or shut down government agencies.",
      "But Musk didn't appear concerned about an extended slump in sales of new Tesla cars in his March 20 address to employees. He reassured the workers that the company's Model Y, which is undergoing a refresh, would remain \"the best-selling car on Earth again this year.\" He also predicted Tesla will have sold more than 10 million cars worldwide by next year, up from about 7 million cars now.",
      "\"There are times when there are rocky moments, where there is stormy weather, but what I am here to tell you is that the future is incredibly bright and exciting,\" Musk said.",
      "After Mr. Trump was elected last November, investors initially saw Musk's alliance with the president as a positive development for Tesla and its long-running efforts to launch\u00a0a network of self-driving cars.",
      "That optimism helped lift Tesla's stock by 70% in the period between Mr. Trump's Nov. 5 election and his Jan. 20 inauguration, creating an additional $560 billion in shareholder wealth. But virtually all those gains have evaporated amid investor worries about the Tesla backlash, lagging sales in the U.S., Europe and China, and Musk spending time overseeing DOGE.",
      "\"This continues to be a moment of truth for Musk to navigate this brand tornado crisis moment and get onto the other side of this dark chapter for Tesla,\" Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives said in a research note leading up to Saturday's protests.",

    "story": [
      "Health care took center stage during the Covid-19 pandemic.\u00a0 And in the five years since, the industry has experienced change and innovation.",
      "The field of medicine has undergone significant changes since the COVID-19 pandemic, with the biggest breakthrough right at our fingertips: telemedicine.\u00a0 While it may feel like a \"normal\" part of healthcare now, connected technology dominated how Americans saw doctors during the pandemic. \"Before the pandemic, virtual care was available, but it was not widely used. Now telemedicine is mainstream,\" says Dr. Michael Aziz, an Attending Physician at New York's Lenox Hill Hospital.",
      "According to one study, telemedicine encounters increased 766% in the first three months of the COVID outbreak. And while use of the 2-D technology has tapered off, Dr. Aziz, believes still plays a vital role in medical care, \"Especially for people in rural areas. Especially for young professionals. And it offers convenience. But we have so many barriers when it comes to telemedicine.... especially for senior citizens,\u2019 he explains, \"Also, the government has put some many roadblocks for patients to use that. One is the cost. There's a cost associated with that. It's not covered by many insurance.\"",
      "Experts say while telemedicine has been revolutionary, it's best suited for certain ailments, particularly psychiatric services.\u00a0 Dr. Chris Ivany, Psychiatrist and COO of Family Care Center, emphasizes, \"I think it's clear to say that the pandemic certainly had a immediate and negative effect on many Americans' mental health.\"",
      "A recent Gallup poll shows adults 18 to 49 reported a steep drop in their mental health since 2020, with many suffering from depression, anxiety, and isolation.\u00a0 This has led to an increase in Americans seeking help post-crisis.\u00a0 Dr. Ivany notes, \"The stigma to seeking mental health care is definitely decreased over the course of the past five or so years.... but also, in part to just a general recognition that mental health care is part of health care overall.\"\u00a0 Dr. Ivany points to two main reasons we're seeing a growth in mental health care, \"Part of what the pandemic has done is to raise the awareness of mental health issues, challenges across the American population in a way that really hadn't been done really in the past.... And I think the second is the field now is much more flexible in terms of how care can be delivered to people.\"",
      "Another challenge changing the landscape of the industry, a significant reduction in staffing. Dr. Aziz says, \"About 3000 healthcare professionals have died and about 100,000 have retired or changed career... Hospitals have a hard time not only hiring physicians and health care workers, but they have a hard time retaining them.\"",
      "While telemedicine has been a game changer, it\u2019s not the only major innovation to emerge from the pandemic. The production and rollout of the COVID-19 vaccine, along with advancements in rapid testing and antigen tests, are also transformative innovations born out of the pandemic."

      "FIRST ON FOX: Government subsidies for electric vehicles (EVs), combined with a regulatory credit system for vehicle emissions, are leading to rising automobile and utility costs, a new report from the American Energy Institute (AEI) reveals.",
      "Increasingly stringent Corporate Average Fuel Economy and greenhouse gas tailpipe emissions standards have forced gas-powered vehicle manufacturers to produce more EVs. As a result, this has siphoned auto manufacturers' resources away from gas-powered vehicle production and toward EV production, ultimately pushing the costs of gas-powered cars higher, according a report by the AEI.",
      "If auto manufacturers do not produce enough EVs to meet state and federal standards, they are forced to buy into a credit system to offset their emissions production, inevitably creating another avenue where additional costs are transferred to consumers, according to the report.",
      "GOP LAWMAKER SEEKS TO SLAM BRAKES ON BIDEN'S \u2018WOKE AND WASTEFUL\u2019 EV TAX CREDIT",
      "Utility costs also see an impact, AEI's report points out. State and federal subsidy and rebate programs for EV charging infrastructure, while beneficial for utility companies' profits, lead once more to increased costs that are subsequently passed on to rate payers. Forty states offer rebates for in-home level two chargers, while at the federal level, rebate and subsidy programs for EV charging infrastructure received an investment of roughly $7.5 billion under former President Joe Biden.",
      "\"By distorting the market with regulatory credits, subsidies, and behind-the-scenes rulemaking, federal agencies are shifting costs from affluent EV buyers to working-class Americans \u2014 while straining a grid that\u2019s already under pressure,\" said Jason Isaac, co-author of the report and the founder and CEO of AEI. \"This isn\u2019t about consumer choice or energy innovation. It\u2019s administrative overreach that leaves Americans paying more to drive and to keep the lights on.\"",
      "Isaac, a former Texas state representative, admitted that during his time in the legislature, he worked to create an EV subsidy in the Lone Star State, which provided all EV buyers with a $2,500 tax credit. He said that over time, he realized the majority of fully electric vehicles were being purchased by wealthier individuals who, according to the National Bureau of Economic Research, would have done so even without the subsidies.",
      "\"This policy is not a home run,\" said Hunt Allcott, a professor of environmental social sciences and a senior fellow at the Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Research, with regard to the federal EV tax credit system. \"While the [Inflation Reduction Act's] electric vehicle tax credits have slowed climate change and shifted production to U.S. manufacturing firms, they also impose high costs on U.S. taxpayers.\"",
      "TOP AGENCY STAFFER TRYING TO BLOCK CRUCIAL TRUMP DIRECTIVE ONCE MANAGED DEI TEAM",
      "Each EV that's purchased benefits from an estimated $94,000 to $153,000 in hidden subsidies over a 10-year period, according to research from the AEI. These figures account for the costs automakers bear to meet government mandates as well as losses from forced EV production, expenses that ultimately raise prices for consumers.",
      "A Tesla charges at an electric vehicle charging station in New York.",
      "Rebates and subsidies for EV charging infrastructure are driving up base utility rates for consumers as well, the AEI report states. It is estimated that if each EV sold resulted in one in-home or commercial charging infrastructure, the more than 1.1 million EVs sold in 2023 would have received more than $827 million in residential charging tax credits.",
      "Isaac said these rebates and subsidies are then used by utility companies to lobby public utility commissions to approve higher base rates because they are enhancing their infrastructure to improve EV infrastructure.",
      "\"When you go buy a gallon of gasoline, [taxpayers] are not helping you pay for that gallon of gasoline; all the costs are embedded within a gallon of gasoline,\" Isaac said. \"So the typical EV charge, whatever they pay at the charging station, is only a small portion of the expenses. That charging station itself has received a significant subsidy, both from the state and the federal government, and the utility has come in and increased the infrastructure or improved, enhanced the infrastructure to handle that load, and the rate payers in that particular area are picking up that burden.\"",

      "One anecdote used in the report to illustrate the cost burden of EV charging subsidies and rebates posits that if one homeowner were to purchase an EV charger on a street of 10 people, and the local electric company provides that homeowner with a $500 rebate, the downhill impacts lead to each of the 10 households shouldering a roughly $50 cost to build the charger as a result of the subsidized rate increases.",

      "Phishing attacks are everywhere, and most of us can spot the obvious ones. Even if someone falls for one and hands over their password, two-factor authentication (2FA) usually adds a crucial layer of protection. But a new phishing kit making the rounds can bypass 2FA entirely by using session hijacking and real-time credential interception.",
      "Known as Astaroth, this tool intercepts and manipulates traffic between your device and legitimate authentication services like Gmail, Yahoo and Microsoft. Since it grabs everything in real time, it completely bypasses 2FA and gives attackers full access to your account.",

      "Illustration of a hacker at work (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How Astaroth works",
      "Astaroth is a next-level phishing kit that takes scamming to a whole new level. Instead of using basic fake login pages like traditional phishing kits, it works as a middleman between your device and the real authentication service while silently grabbing everything needed to break in.",
      "The attack begins when you click on a phishing link and land on a malicious site that looks identical to the real one. Since the site has valid SSL certificates, there are no red flags, no security warnings and no sketchy pop-ups. When you enter your login details, including username, password, device info and IP address, Astaroth snatches them up before passing the request to the actual website.",
      "Two-factor authentication is not a problem for Astaroth. It intercepts one-time passwords the second they are entered, whether they come from an authenticator app, SMS or a push notification. The stolen codes are instantly sent to the attacker through a web panel or Telegram alert, so they can use them before they expire.",
      "The real kicker is that Astaroth also grabs session cookies, which are the small bits of data that keep users logged in after authentication. Attackers can inject these cookies into their own browsers, skipping the need for passwords or two-factor authentication altogether. Once they have the session, they are in with no extra steps required.",

      "As reported by cybersecurity company\u00a0SlashNext, Astaroth stands out from other phishing kits because of its ability to intercept credentials in real time, automate attacks and resist takedown efforts. Traditional phishing depends on tricking victims into entering their credentials on fake login pages, but Astaroth removes that step entirely.",
      "Beyond its advanced capabilities, Astaroth comes with features that make it appealing to cybercriminals. It uses bulletproof hosting to stay online despite law enforcement efforts, receives frequent updates to bypass security patches and follows a structured payment model. For $2,000, buyers get six months of continuous upgrades. To build trust, the creators even let hackers test the phishing kit before purchasing.",

      "1) Avoid unknown links and use strong antivirus software: Remember that no matter how advanced the malware is, it still needs input from you. In most cases, an attacker will require you to click a link before they can steal your data. For example, for Astaroth to work, you have to click a link, visit a malicious website and enter your credentials. If you don\u2019t click the link, you stay clear of the malware.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS device.",
      "2) Double-check sites:\u00a0Always verify website addresses and use bookmarks for trusted sites. Instead of clicking on links in emails or messages, manually type the URL or use a trusted bookmark. This minimizes the risk of landing on a fraudulent page designed to mimic a legitimate website.",
      "3) Update your devices:\u00a0You might wonder how keeping your devices updated helps against malware like Astaroth. While it doesn\u2019t directly prevent an attack, it ensures the situation doesn\u2019t get worse.\u00a0Keeping your operating system and applications up to date with the latest security patches closes vulnerabilities that malware might exploit, making it harder for attackers to gain a foothold on your device.",
      "4) Avoid typing passwords:\u00a0Avoid entering passwords whenever possible to reduce the risk of credential theft. Instead, use authentication methods like passkeys, Google Sign-In or Apple Sign-In.",
      "A passkey is a feature that uses cryptographic key pairs to verify your identity, eliminating the need for traditional passwords. It allows you to sign in to apps and websites using the same process you use to unlock your device, such as biometrics, PIN or pattern.",
      "Google Sign-In is a feature that allows you to log in to third-party apps or websites using their Google Account credentials. It simplifies the sign-in process by eliminating the need to create and remember separate usernames and passwords for each service. You can sign in via a \"Sign in with Google\" button, a Google sign-in prompt or automatic sign-in if previously authorized.",
      "Apple Sign-In is a feature that enables you to privately sign in to participating third-party apps and websites using your Apple ID. It offers a fast, easy and more private way to authenticate without the need to create new accounts or remember additional passwords. To set up an account to \"Sign in with Apple,\" when a participating website or app asks you to set up or upgrade an account, do the following: Tap Sign in with Apple. Follow the onscreen instructions. Some apps (and websites) don\u2019t request your name and email address. In this case, you simply authenticate with Face ID or Touch ID (depending on your model), then start using the app.\u00a0Others may ask for your name and email address to set up a personalized account. When an app asks for this information, Sign in with Apple displays your name and the personal email address from your Apple Account for you to review.",
      "These methods rely on cryptographic keys or secure tokens, making it much harder for attackers to intercept your login information, even if they manage to trick you into visiting a malicious site.",

      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "Astaroth shows just how far phishing kits have come, taking things beyond the usual tricks and bypassing 2FA with ease. It\u2019s a reminder that no matter how secure we think our systems are, there\u2019s always a smarter attack waiting to exploit the gaps. Cybercriminals are adapting fast, and while traditional defenses may not cut it anymore, there are still steps you can take to fight back: use passwordless logins, stay updated and keep learning about these evolving threats.",

      "What is generative AI and why should you care?",
      "Generative AI refers to so-called artificial intelligence systems that create new content \u2014 text, images, audio or video \u2014 based on data they've been trained on. Unlike traditional AI that analyzes existing information, generative AI produces entirely new, convincing content. The most concerning part? These powerful tools are increasingly accessible to fraudsters who use them to create sophisticated scams that are harder than ever to detect.",

      "BEST ANTIVIRUS FOR MAC, PC, IPHONES AND ANDROIDS \u2014 CYBERGUY PICKS",
      "How fraudsters are weaponizing GenAI",
      "Today's scammers use generative AI to \"supercharge\" their existing techniques while enabling entirely new types of fraud, according to\u00a0Dave Schroeder, UW\u2013Madison national security research strategist. Here are the four most dangerous ways they're using this technology.",
      "With just three seconds of audio, easily obtained from social media, voicemails or videos, fraudsters can create a convincing replica of your voice using AI. \"Imagine a situation where a 'family member' calls from what appears to be their phone number and says they have been kidnapped,\" explains Schroeder. \"Victims of these scams have said they were sure it was their family member's voice.\"",
      "These AI-generated voice clones can be used to manipulate loved ones, coworkers or even financial institutions into transferring money or sharing sensitive information, making it increasingly difficult to distinguish between genuine and fraudulent calls.",
      "Today's AI tools can generate convincing fake identification documents with AI-generated images. Criminals use these to verify identity when fraudulently opening accounts or taking over existing ones. These AI-generated fake IDs are becoming increasingly sophisticated, often including realistic holograms and barcodes that can bypass traditional security checks and even fool automated verification systems.",
      "Many financial institutions use selfies for customer verification. However, fraudsters can take images from social media to create deepfakes that bypass these security measures. These AI-generated deepfakes are not limited to still images; they can also produce realistic videos that can fool liveness detection checks during facial recognition processes, posing a significant threat to biometric authentication systems.",
      "Similarly, GenAI now crafts flawlessly written, highly personalized\u00a0phishing emails that analyze your online presence to create messages specifically tailored to your interests and personal details. These AI-enhanced phishing attempts can also incorporate sophisticated chatbots and improved grammar, making them significantly more convincing and harder to detect than traditional\u00a0phishing scams.",
      "A man working on his laptop. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "HOW TO PROTECT YOUR DATA FROM IRS SCAMMERS THIS TAX SEASON",
      "Why you might be a prime target",
      "While everyone is at risk from these sophisticated AI scams, certain factors can make you a more attractive target to fraudsters. Those with substantial retirement savings or investments naturally represent more valuable targets \u2014 the more assets you have, the more attention you'll attract from criminals looking for bigger payoffs. Many older adults are particularly vulnerable as they didn't grow up with today's technology and may be less familiar with AI's capabilities. This knowledge gap makes it harder to recognize when AI is being used maliciously. Compounding this risk is an extensive digital footprint: if you're active on social media or have a significant online presence, you're inadvertently providing fraudsters with the raw materials they need to create convincing deepfakes and highly personalized scams designed specifically to exploit your trust.",

      "FBI WARNS OF DANGEROUS NEW \u2018SMASHING' SCAM TARGETING YOUR PHONE",
      "How to protect yourself in the age of AI",
      "Protection against AI-powered threats requires a multi-layered approach that goes well beyond just digital measures. Awareness is your first line of defense \u2014 understanding how these scams work helps you spot red flags before you become a victim. This awareness should be paired with both digital safeguards and \"analog\" verification systems that exist entirely offline. Here are some key steps to protect yourself:",
      "1.\u00a0Invest in personal data removal services: Generative AI fundamentally needs your personal data to craft convincing scams, which is why limiting your online footprint has become paramount in today's fraud landscape. The less information about you that's publicly available, the fewer raw materials scammers have to work with. Going completely off-grid is unrealistic for most of us today \u2014 much like never leaving your home. But you can reduce your online footprint substantially with a personal data removal service like Incogni, making yourself significantly less exposed to AI-powered scams.",
      "By removing your personal data from data broker companies, you not only protect yourself from GenAI-powered fraud but also gain numerous other privacy benefits, such as reduced risks of receiving spam and falling victim to identity theft, as well as helping to prevent stalking and harassment. As AI technology advances, gen-AI scams will only become more sophisticated. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "2. Establish your own verification protocols:\u00a0Consider agreeing on a \"safe word\" that only family members know. If you receive an unexpected call from a relative in distress, ask for this word before taking action.",
      "3. Choose strong, unique passwords for each account: Create complex passwords using a combination of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. Avoid using easily guessable information like birthdays or common words. Consider using a\u00a0password manager to generate and store complex passwords. A password manager can generate and store strong, unique passwords for all your accounts, reducing the risk of password reuse and making it easier to maintain good password hygiene. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed Password Managers of 2025 here.",
      "4. Enable two-factor authentication (2FA) on all accounts: 2FA adds an extra layer of security by requiring a second form of verification, such as a code sent to your phone, in addition to your password.",
      "5. Receive MFA codes via an authenticator app on your phone rather than email when possible: Using an\u00a0authenticator app like Microsoft Authenticator or Google Authenticator is more secure than receiving codes via email. Authenticator apps generate time-based one-time passcodes (TOTPs) that are not transmitted over email or SMS, reducing the risk of interception by hackers. Additionally, authenticator apps often support biometric authentication and push notifications, making the verification process both secure and convenient.",
      "6. Use a strong antivirus software: Modern cybersecurity threats are evolving rapidly, with AI being used to create more convincing phishing attacks, deepfake scams, and malware. Investing in strong antivirus software can help identify and block suspicious activity before it reaches you. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "7. Trust your intuition and verify: If something feels \"off,\" like you notice unusual phrasing or strange background noises, trust your instincts. Don't let fraudsters create a false sense of urgency. If you receive a communication claiming to be from a financial institution, call that institution directly using the official number from its website.",
      "8. Monitor your accounts: Review account statements regularly for suspicious transactions. Don\u2019t hesitate to request a credit freeze if you suspect your data has been compromised.",

      "2. Don\u2019t click links from unverified emails and use strong antivirus software:\u00a0Many ClickFix attacks start with phishing emails that impersonate trusted services like Booking.com or Google Meet. Always verify the sender before clicking on links. If an email seems urgent or unexpected, go directly to the company\u2019s official website instead of clicking any links inside the email.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "3. Enable two-factor authentication:\u00a0Enable two-factor authentication whenever possible. This adds an extra layer of security by requiring a second form of verification, such as a code sent to your phone, in addition to your password.",
      "4. Keep devices updated: Regularly\u00a0updating your operating system, browser and security software ensures you have the latest patches against known vulnerabilities. Cybercriminals exploit outdated systems, so enabling automatic updates is a simple but effective way to stay protected.",
      "5. Monitor your accounts for suspicious activity and change your passwords:\u00a0If you\u2019ve interacted with a suspicious website, phishing email or fake login page, check your online accounts for any unusual activity. Look for unexpected login attempts, unauthorized password resets or financial transactions that you don\u2019t recognize. If anything seems off, change your passwords immediately and report the activity to the relevant service provider. Also, consider using a\u00a0password manager to generate and store complex passwords. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 here.",
      "6. Invest in personal data removal service: Consider using a service that monitors your personal information and alerts you to potential breaches or unauthorized use of your data. These services can provide early warning signs of identity theft or other malicious activities resulting from ClickFix or similar attacks. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "MASSIVE SECURITY FLAW PUTS MOST POPULAR BROWSERS AT RISK ON MAC",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "ClickFix is a reminder that malware doesn\u2019t always rely on complex exploits. It often just needs you to follow the wrong instructions. Attackers are refining their methods, making scams like fake CAPTCHAs, phishing emails and deceptive pop-ups more convincing than ever. The best way to stay ahead is to question anything that seems even slightly off. If a website asks you to run commands or paste something into PowerShell, it\u2019s a red flag. If an email pressures you into clicking a link, verify it first.",

      "Hackers worldwide are exploiting any type of free document converter or downloader tool to carry out this scheme. The scam may involve websites that promise to convert files, such as turning a .doc into a .pdf, or tools that claim to merge multiple images into a single document.

      "3. Avoid downloading executable files:\u00a0If an online document converter provides an .exe, .bat or .scr file instead of a standard document format, do not download or run it. Legitimate converters should only generate files like .pdf, .docx or .png, not executables that could contain malware.",
      "4. Scan files after conversion: Even if you use a trusted converter, always scan the converted file with up-to-date\u00a0strong antivirus software before opening it.",
      "5. Check file permissions: After conversion, verify that the new file doesn't have unexpected permissions or properties that could indicate malware.",
      "6. Create backups and enable ransomware protection:\u00a0Regularly\u00a0back up important documents on an external drive or a secure cloud service. Some security suites, like Microsoft Defender, offer ransomware protection features that prevent unauthorized changes to your files.",
      "7. Be cautious of browser extensions: Avoid installing browser extensions for file conversion, as these can often be browser hijackers or adware.",
      "8. Consider paid services: If you frequently need to convert files, invest in a reputable paid service that offers better security and privacy protection.",
      "9. Use cloud-based solutions: Consider using cloud-based productivity suites that offer built-in conversion tools, reducing the need for third-party converters.",

      "The real issue is not just malware-laced converters but the habit of trading security for convenience without a second thought. The internet is filled with services that appear free but come at the hidden cost of stolen data, financial fraud or compromised devices. Instead of trusting every tool that offers an easy solution, it is important to think critically about what we are giving away whenever we upload a file or click a download button.",

      "Michael Tanzi, 48, is scheduled to be executed April 8 at Florida State Prison for his conviction in the kidnapping and murder of a woman in Miami in 2000. Gov. Ron DeSantis signed his death warrant on March 10, but Tanzi\u2019s lawyers are seeking a stay of execution from the state's highest court.",
      "Tanzi's lawyers said in court documents filed last week that their client is morbidly obese and suffers from sciatica, a condition that causes pain along the back's sciatic nerve.",
      "They argued that Florida's lethal injection procedure may not work due to Tanzi's weight, stressing that a sedation drug might not fully take effect and leave him \"paralyzed but aware\" during the process. His lawyers claimed that executing him would violate the Eighth Amendment, which protects against forms of cruel and unusual punishment.",

      "Michael Tanzi, 48, is scheduled to be executed April 8 at Florida State Prison. (Florida Department of Corrections)",
      "\"The existing procedures utilize a one size fits none approach that does not allow for modification of dosage,\" his lawyers said in the appeal. \"There is a significant risk that Mr. Tanzi will be paralyzed but aware when the sodium acetate is injected, creating the sensation of being burned from the inside.\"",
      "Tanzi will \"likely suffer pulmonary edema, creating a sensation of suffocation and drowning,\" his lawyers noted, adding that his obesity, acid reflux and sleep apnea \"create a substantial risk that, if sedated while on his back, he will suffer from reflux and aspiration of vomit.\"",
      "His obesity will make it impossible for the state to humanely carry out his execution using the existing procedure, his lawyers argued.",
      "\"The existing protocols for lethal injection do not contemplate the execution of someone with obesity and uncontrolled medical conditions, like Mr. Tanzi's, that are likely to complicate the lethal injection process,\" Tanzi's lawyers said. \"Executing Mr. Tanzi using the existing protocols is likely to cause serious illness and needless suffering.\"",

      "Tanzi's lawyers argued that executing him would violate the Eighth Amendment, which protects against forms of cruel and unusual punishment. (AP Photo/Sue Ogrocki, File)",
      "Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier responded to the appeal by Tanzi's lawyers by saying they have not shown that the state's lethal injection protocol would violate protections against cruel and unusual punishment. Uthmeier also noted that Tanzi's lawyers had plenty of time to raise their concerns but waited until just before the scheduled execution.",
      "\"Tanzi fails to offer any support for his groundless assertion that the massive dose of etomidate, that has been repeatedly and successfully used in Florida's lethal injection protocol, will not work for him,\" Uthmeier's office said.",
      "In Florida, executions must be carried out by lethal injection or electric chair.",
      "Tanzi was convicted of kidnapping Janet Acosta in April 2000, strangling her to death, and leaving her body in the Keys before he continued driving south to visit friends. He was arrested after a missing persons report was filed and he was seen driving Acosta's vehicle.",

He bound and gagged her before he began driving the van toward the Florida Keys. At one point, Tanzi sexually assaulted Acosta and used her bank card to withdraw money from ATMs.",
      "If Tanzi's execution is carried out as planned, it would be the third in Florida so far this year. James Dennis Ford was put to death last month for the 1997 murder of a couple in Charlotte County and Edward James was executed earlier this month for raping and murdering an 8-year-old girl and killing her grandmother."

      "The FBI labels sovereign citizens as extremists and characterizes them as people who believe they are sovereign from the United States government and thus do not have to answer to government authorities, including law enforcement, courts, taxing entities and others. At best, they are a loosely affiliated group who hold similar beliefs, but most sovereign citizens act on their own without any central organization guiding them.",
      "They are also known for filing lawsuits against government authorities, a trait embodied by Rita Bixby, who filed unsuccessful lawsuits against state entities.",
      "After the standoff, Steven Bixby was charged with two counts of murder and one count of criminal conspiracy, and sentenced to death in February 2007. Arthur and Rita Bixby were charged in the attack too, and both were sentenced to life in prison.",
      "After exhausting his appeals by 2010, Bixby's days were numbered. However, the state faced a shortage of lethal injection drugs, and indefinitely paused all executions. A 2021 state law allowed death sentences to resume via firing squad or electrocution. After years of litigation, the state executed its first death row inmate in 13 years, opening the door for Bixby's execution.",

      "The first prong echoes that of the U.S. Supreme Court's only competency test: whether a person understands that they are going to be executed, and why.",
      "The South Carolina Supreme Court has a second prong, established in the 1993 case Singleton v. State: whether a person is able to rationally communicate with their counsel. Bixby's lawyers are arguing that because of his ardent belief in sovereign citizenship and because of his undying admiration and loyalty to his parents, he was genuinely unable to understand that he faced the death penalty and that he could not communicate rationally with his lawyers.",

Brooks claimed to be a sovereign citizen and represented himself in court after mowing down innocent people and killing six at a Christmas parade in Waukesha, Wisconsin. He was sentenced to six life terms plus 700 years in prison for his crimes.",
      "\"Well, first of all, just because you have a crazy belief, it does not serve as a defense to either a crime or an execution under the prevailing Supreme Court standard,\" Meltsner said. \"The only way that could be relevant to what the hearing would be about is if it was relevant to the legal standard for insanity or the legal standard for having such a serious mental condition that you can't be executed.\"",
      "But Meltsner said the South Carolina Supreme Court can have broader standards for execution than the standards set forth by the U.S. Supreme Court.",

It could be malicious and manipulative. But as a general matter, you can argue any damn thing you want in court. It's up to the courts to decide what it means.\"",

    "summary": "A UK Parliament report chaired by respected historian Lord Andrew Roberts calls the Oct. 7 Hamas attack in Israel deliberate and brutal, urging democracies to combat denial and misinformation.",
    "story": [
      "Lord Andrew Roberts, chairman of the All-Party Parliamentary Group, discusses their landmark report on the October 7 massacre by Hamas terrorists.",
      "A Holocaust survivor murdered at age 91 and a baby killed just 14 hours after birth are among the victims named in the U.K.'s October 7 Parliamentary Commission Report, the most detailed Western investigation to date into the Hamas-led attack on Israel.",
      "The 318-page report, chaired by British historian and peer Lord Andrew Roberts, documents the deaths of 1,182 people in a 48-hour period and provides extensive evidence of atrocities committed against civilians.",
      "The report describes the assault as \"a meticulously planned operation designed not only to kill but to terrorize through extreme brutality, looting and humiliation.\" It includes testimonies of group rapes of women and girls, some of whom were murdered, as well as evidence of sexual violence committed against corpses. It details the targeting of children, including infants shot in strollers or burned alive.",
      "REPORT EXPOSES HAMAS TERRORIST CRIMES AGAINST FAMILIES DURING OCT 7 MASSACRE: 'KINOCIDE'",
      "Hamas terrorists killed civilians, including women, children and the elderly, when they attacked Israel on Oct. 7.\u00a0 (Israel Defense Forces via AP)",
      "Roberts, one of Britain\u2019s leading historians and a member of the House of Lords, said that meeting Mandy Damari, the mother of hostage Emily Damari, \"reduced me to tears.\" Speaking in an interview with Fox News Digital, Lord Roberts recalled visiting Kibbutz Kfar Aza and hearing from families of victims while the fate of their loved ones was still unknown.",
      "\"At that time, of course, she didn\u2019t know whether her 27-year-old daughter, Emily, was going to be released or not, or whether she was going to die in Gaza,\" he said. \"And I have a 25-year-old daughter, and so it was brought home incredibly powerfully to me.\"",
      "Despite the graphic nature of the material, Roberts emphasized that the report was deliberately limited to verified facts. \"We actually made the report much less than it could have been, because we insisted on only putting things in that could be double-checked,\" he said. \"If we had put in things that we truly believe happened but couldn't prove happened, we kept them out.\"",
      "A bloodied handprint stains a wall in a Nir Oz house after Hamas terrorists attacked this kibbutz days earlier near the border of Gaza. (Alexi J. Rosenfeld/Getty Images)",
      "When asked what motivated him to take on the project, Roberts said, \"The denialism that has already cropped up,\" including attempts to downplay or question the events of October 7. \"It\u2019s quite ironic that as well as celebrating and indulging in their most sort of disgusting fantasies by wearing GoPro cameras, they also seek to deny that the whole thing ever happened,\" he said of Hamas.",
      "HAMAS' OCT 7 MASSACRE HAS LEGAL SCHOLARS CREATING NEW WAR CRIME CATEGORY",
      "\"October 7 denial,\" as the report refers to it, emerged almost immediately after the attacks and mirrors historical patterns of atrocity denial, despite the overwhelming evidence.",
      "\"I thought it was really important to get a big, thick, well-documented, irrefutable, fully footnoted document out there that will stand the test of time,\" Roberts said.",
      "Hamas terrorists kidnap a bloodied Israeli woman into the Gaza Strip.\u00a0 (Hamas-Telegram)",
      "The report includes accounts of mass looting, arson and mutilation. It states that terrorists used victims\u2019 phones to send images to their families, booby-trapped corpses with grenades, and dragged bodies through Gaza. It confirms that \"acts of sexual violence\" occurred \"across all sites\" during the attack, and references forensic findings of partially or fully naked bodies.",
      "'I WILL BE HAUNTED FOREVER\u2019: ISRAEL\u2019S HORRIFIC VIDEO OF HAMAS ATROCITIES LEAVES VIEWERS SHOCKED AND SICKENED",
      "Roberts said the attack was \"not just spontaneous \u2014 it was a premeditated bloodlust.\" He compared it to historical atrocities like the Rape of Nanjing in 1937. \"Once Hamas got into a bloodlust, they were going out of their way to murder and kill absolutely anybody who came anywhere near them,\" he said.",
      "Despite the horrors, Roberts said the report also includes examples of heroism. For example, of Netta Epstein \u2014 a young man who \"threw himself on a grenade to save his fianc\u00e9e's life\" \u2014 Roberts said such acts \"stand up with the great acts of heroism of any age.\"",
      "Released hostages Doron Steinbrecher and Emily Damari, wearing green, are greeted by Israeli soldiers following their arrival in Israel after being held in Gaza since the deadly Oct. 7, 2023 attack, following their release as part of a hostage-prisoner exchange deal between Hamas and Israel, in southern Israel, in a screen grab from a handout video obtained by Reuters on Jan. 19, 2025.\u00a0 (\u00a0Israel Defense Forces/Handout via Reuters)",
      "\"We have the names in it of everybody who was killed ... mostly with the circumstances of their deaths as well,\" Roberts added: \"Speaking as a historian, there are moments when one thinks of 9/11, or Pearl Harbor, various other attacks like this. They become part of history very quickly, but the actual individuals involved tend to get forgotten.\"",
      "Asked what role democracies should play in countering denialism, Roberts answered, \"The first is properly to memorialize the victims,\" he said. \"The second ... is to see this appalling act of barbarism for what it is, which is a complete denial of democracy, a blow struck deliberately against civilization, and ... the most appalling act of racism.\"",

      "\"Britain should be doing everything in its power to help Israel protect itself forever against such another attack,\" Roberts clarified that he was expressing a personal view: \"At the moment, it seems [the British government] is not doing that at all.\"",
      "In the report\u2019s conclusion, Roberts and his colleagues wrote: \"Our report will hopefully permit people to see such denials and justifications for what they really are: a perversion of and rejection of human decency. We owe it to the victims and their grieving families to set down the ghastly unvarnished truth about the sheer barbarism that Hamas and its terrorist allies unleashed on October 7, 2023.\"",

      "\"Torpedo\" talk filled baseball airwaves Monday with managers, players and physicists wanting to know more about the long-ball-launching rods that were all the buzz of opening week.",
      "The New York Yankees swept the Milwaukee Brewers to open the 2025 season, but it was the Bronx Bombers' use of unconventionally shaped bats \u2014 and eye-popping 15 home runs \u2014 that caught baseball's attention.",
      "Philadelphia Phillies manager Rob Thomson, a longtime Yankees coach, said he'd never heard of the bats until the middle of last week.",
      "\"I wasn't even sure if it was a thing or not, if it was real. But I guess it is real,\" Thomson told reporters ahead of his team's home opener in Philadelphia on Monday. \"So we're looking into it.\"",
      "While the bats looked unusual, they were perfectly legal, the Yankees and MLB said.",
      "While MLB declined comment on the matter, the league said \"numerous players on numerous clubs,\" including all of the other teams in the Yankees\u2019 American League East, are also using some form of these so-called torpedo bats.",
      "Meets MLB specifications",
      "Bats must be made of\u00a0solid wood, smooth, round and no more than 2.61 inches in diameter and 42 inches in length, though most are no more than 34 inches long today.",
      "Each bat must be approved by Major League Baseball, though they're all slightly different, as manufacturers and players have gone back and forth about weight distribution for individual batters.",
      "But for the most part, the hitter\u2019s sweet spot of a 34-inch-long bat \u2014 where batters hope to connect with maximum acceleration and mass \u2014 is several inches down from the end and just above where the manufacturer's label is marked.",
      "Where the bats seen in Yankee Stadium over the weekend differ is the additional weight at the sweet spot \u2014 and just below that traditional zone, going toward a batter\u2019s hands.",
      "A pitcher\u2019s goal, aside from striking out a batter, is to induce weak contact.",
      "That\u2019s often done with a pitch breaking horizontally as a batter swings in the belief he\u2019ll connect with the sweet spot before the ball ends up closer to his hands, in contact that\u2019s colloquially called getting \u201cjammed.\u201d",
      "A typical MLB game will feature at least one broken bat \u2014 the ultimate result of a batter\u2019s being \u201cjammed\u201d \u2014 in what's probably the second biggest thrill for a pitcher, aside from a strikeout.",
      "So when Yankees researchers found that shortstop Anthony Volpe had a propensity for getting jammed, as YES network play-by-play announcer Michael Kay explained over the weekend, the answer was to turn that weakness into a potential strength by moving more mass down the bat.",
      "'You're always looking for the slightest edge'",
      "Former Yankees infielder Kevin Smith, who along with Kay brought the issue to light over the weekend, said torpedo bats are the next natural step in baseball technology.",
      "\"You know, in baseball, you\u2019re always looking for the slightest edge,\" Smith who is retired, told NBC News on Monday.",
      "\"I mean, pitchers have been doing it forever. You know, there\u2019s been a bunch of bat technology that has come out that is helping hitters,\" he said. \"This is just kind of the next step, but we\u2019ll see.\"",
      "That extra bit of mass put in a spot that would normally result in weak contact off the handle could make all the difference.",
      "\"We can put wood in places where you don\u2019t hit the ball, or we can put wood where it matters the most,\" Smith said, \"and so taking a little bit of wood off the end where you really don\u2019t want to hit the ball at all and putting it into a spot where you might make more contact and do more damage.\"",
      "Philadelphia second baseman Bryson Stott said the torpedo bat isn't for everyone and that it will benefit only hitters who are perpetually being jammed and have thousands of points of data to prove it.",
      "\"If you hit it off the end, with that torpedo bat, you're in trouble,\" he told reporters Monday. \"So it's mostly where you hit it and where all their computers and things are telling you where you're hitting it.\"",
      "The bats were innovated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology-educated physicist Aaron Leanhardt, a former Yankees analyst who was hired as the Miami Marlins\u2019 field coordinator this past winter.",
      "Leanhardt declined comment Monday as his innovation was the talk of the game.",
      "'Revolutionary' or 'clever innovation'?",
      "David Pritchard, an MIT physics professor and onetime teacher of Leanhardt, said Leanhardt was always intellectually curious.",
      "\"Baseball is a very traditional game, and if you get up there with a funny-looking bat and you strike out, when you go back to the dugout, what's going to happen? You're going to get razzed by the other teammates, right?\" Pritchard said.",
      "\"It just takes some outsiders, like Aaron, who has a Ph.D. from MIT and really understands physics and knows what's going on, to be the sort of guy who drives something under the radar and see if it works,\" he said.",
      "Yankees like Volpe, Jazz Chisholm Jr., Cody Bellinger, Paul Goldschmidt and Austin Wells\u00a0will perhaps have an early upper hand with the new bats.",
      "In the three-game demolition of Milwaukee, they were a red-hot 18-for-59 (.305) combined, with nine long balls.",
      "California Institute of Technology president, quantum physicist and baseball fan Thomas Rosenbaum expects pitchers to adjust quickly and find new ways to attack those hitters.",
      "\"I don't think it's revolutionary, but it's a clever innovation,\" Rosenbaum said. \"In the short term probably will have larger effects than in the long term would be my prediction.\""

    "summary": "Freshwater essential to lithium mining is running low in the world\u2019s \u201cLithium Triangle,\u201d a mineral-rich region in the Andean Plateau that stretches across parts of Argentina, Bolivia and Chile and contains more than half of all global lithium reserves.",
    "story": [
      "Freshwater essential to lithium mining is running low in the world\u2019s \u201cLithium Triangle,\u201d a mineral-rich region in the Andean Plateau that stretches across parts of Argentina, Bolivia and Chile and contains more than half of all global lithium reserves.",
      "In a study published last week in the journal Communications Earth and Environment, researchers found that the amount of freshwater locally available for lithium extraction is about 10 times lower than previous estimates. Global lithium demand, which is expected to grow by 40 times by 2040, could outpace the limited annual rain that supplies freshwater to the arid Lithium Triangle.",
      "The paper\u2019s authors urged the lithium industry to reduce their freshwater usage and avoid disrupting mining operations, which rely heavily on freshwater availability, consuming up to 500,000 gallons of water to extract one ton of lithium. In the Lithium Triangle, freshwater also supports agriculture for small, Indigenous communities and sustains wetlands that are home to short-tailed chinchillas, wild camelids and pink flamingo species found nowhere else in the world.",
      "\u201cWater is the most important resource in these systems, and it\u2019s the part of the system that is most sensitive to change,\u201d David Boutt, an author of the paper and a professor of geosciences at the University of Massachusetts-Amherst, said. \u201cI\u2019m optimistic that, through research and development, companies can be more water efficient, especially when driven by the market.\u201d",
      "While water drives life and industry in the Triangle, lithium is critical to the global regulatory push for electrification and the growth of clean technology industries. The mineral is an essential component for batteries that power electric vehicles and store energy generated by renewable sources like solar panels and windmills.",
      "The need for lithium batteries is projected to quadruple by 2030, according to the International Energy Agency. Some industry experts are concerned that companies will not be able to meet growing demand, as lithium mines face permitting delays and long procedures to bring mines into operation on top of issues with resource availability.",
      "\u201cWe need more lithium sources to come online to meet the demand we\u2019ll see by 2030,\u201d said Michael McKibben, a professor of geology at the University of California, Riverside. \u201cMineral extraction is a slow, tedious process. That\u2019s why prices are so volatile \u2014 demand goes up, but the supply can\u2019t respond instantaneously.\u201d",
      "In the Lithium Triangle, freshwater plays a crucial role in determining the supply of lithium available for mining. Rain washes lithium and other minerals down from rock formations into deep basins carved into the flat Andean Plateau. The process, which takes place over millions of years, creates brackish lagoons filled with lithium-rich waters.",
      "Mining companies extract lithium fluid from the lagoons and concentrate the mineral with evaporation methods \u2014 which use copious freshwater drawn from nearby aquifers. Water levels in these aquifers depend on the annual rains, which can bring as little as 20 millimeters of precipitation (0.8 inches) in some parts of the Lithium Triangle.",
      "Boutt says that limited meteorological data from a lack of weather stations in the remote Andean Plateau has made it difficult to capture how much freshwater actually flows to these lithium-rich lagoons and the surrounding areas. He added that widely used global hydrologic models that rely on this sparse data have vastly overestimated the freshwater supply in the region.",
      "The model developed by Boutt and his team looked at freshwater in 28 different watersheds across the Lithium Triangle, drawing from field observations as well as national meteorological data and mining industry reports. Boutt says that it provides a more complete picture of freshwater flow into the lithium-rich area.",
      "Research on water and resource availability for lithium mining operations has a long way to go. In the U.S., mining operations at the nation\u2019s only operating lithium mine in Silver Peak, Nevada, have been the subject of criticism for significant and prolonged freshwater pumping in the often drought-stricken region.",
      "Vanessa Schenker, a researcher with the Institute of Environmental Engineering at ETH Zurich, a Swiss university, says that there needs to be more research on the hydrology of lithium-rich regions around the world.",
      "\u201cOn top of how much water lithium mines are using, we also need to examine the entire supply chain for lithium and think of components such as chemical processing and transport,\u201d she said. \u201cUnderstanding the Lithium Triangle will help us understand other systems globally.\u201d"

    "published": "Mon, 31 Mar 2025 13:00:41 GMT",
    "summary": "Since the Trump administration paused funds, local farmers say they're in survival mode.",
    "story": [
      "Native Hawaiian farmer Kaina Makua was anticipating $470,000 from the federal government this year to quadruple his production of kalo, or taro, the ancestral crop that is pounded into the sticky, purple staple poi. In January, he found out the money wasn\u2019t coming.",
      "In Hawaii, where 90% of the food is imported, local farmers like Makua need boosts from federal funding so there is greater food security in the islands. State researchers have found an island needs to grow at least 50% of its staple crops \u2014 like kalo, \u2018ulu (breadfruit) and \u2018uala (sweet potato) \u2014 to be self-sufficient in a disaster.",
      "Local farmers are not only critical to helping alleviate the rate of 1 in 3 households that are food insecure in Hawaii, but they also provide these staples and other produce to food banks and schools. However, since the Trump administration paused funds from the Inflation Reduction Act and cut other U.S. Department of Agriculture programs, nearly $90 million in funding for Hawaii and Pacific region farms and food system organizations has been frozen or cut, according to the O\u02bbahu Resource Conservation and Development Council.",
      "Now local farmers are \u201cin survival mode,\u201d as Makua said \u2014 scaling back and unsure how to make up the loss.",
      "Makua has spent the past 15 years turning his family\u2019s farm in Kauai into a cultural hub, Aloha \u02bb\u0100ina Poi Company, where he mentors young farmers and offers an after-school program so kids can learn Hawaiian farming practices and keep the traditions alive.",
      "\u201cTrying to grow these Indigenous crop systems, and trying to get everybody back to Native foods, it\u2019s an uphill battle,\u201d said Makua. \u201cThere was so much headway being made, so much effort and progress and positivity, just to be once again let down.\u201d",
      "Hawai\u2018i Farm Bureau Executive Director Brian Miyamoto said there is great confusion among local farmers about what is frozen and what is not. For example, the Environmental Quality Incentives Program, which provides technical and financial assistance to agricultural producers, is safe for now. However, without many answers from the federal government about whether the freezes are permanent, or what shoe is dropping next, farmers are scrambling to figure out their next move. The USDA did not respond to request for comment.",
      "\u201cOrganizations that may have had their funding frozen or may not be sure if they\u2019re going to continue being funded, they\u2019re going to have to make business decisions to start possibly laying off staffing, cut back on what the services can offer,\u201d Miyamoto said.",
      "Over the past decade, Native Hawaiian farming practices and food systems have gained momentum, as the state\u2019s goal was to increase local food production to 20% to 30% of food consumed by 2030. Now that progress is in peril.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re not going to be able to achieve those agriculture goals that we\u2019ve been working on for years,\u201d said Miyamoto. \u201cWith our cultural crops, instead of the trend of increasing that production, do we see a scaling back of it, because of the availability of federal funds to help support those programs? There is so much uncertainty.\u201d",
      "The future of Native food production uncertain",
      "Before Western contact, Native Hawaiians subsisted on fishing and staple crops like kalo, \u2018ulu and \u2018uala. By the mid-1800s, European and American businessmen gained enough power in the islands to buy land to turn into sugar and pineapple plantations. When those industries dried up by the 1950s, most of Hawaii\u2019s agricultural land was paved over for tourism development. By the 1960s, only half of Hawaii\u2019s produce was grown locally.",
      "According to the USDA\u2019s 2022 Census of Agriculture, there are around 6,500 farmers in Hawaii, a growing number of whom are Native Hawaiian practitioners like Makua who are working to revitalize traditional food systems and nourish the land.",
      "One way local farmers have increased their reach and power over the past decade is by banding together through food hubs and cooperatives. By combining their yield, farmers can secure state contracts to feed schools and food banks. With the federal cuts, they\u2019re unsure if they can make that happen.",
      "At the Hawai\u2018i \u2018Ulu Cooperative, more than 150 farmers bring in their \u2018ulu harvests, which are then packaged and sold frozen or as flour, pancake mix or other products to local schools, hospitals and retailers. The co-op hoped to increase its \u2018ulu production to a million pounds by 2030, but the USDA has frozen grants providing farmers with direct payments and technical support. A three-year, $6 million grant for farmers is also currently tied up in the funding freeze.",
      "\u201cThe funds for the farmers were mostly about expansion,\u201d said co-op co-founder and CEO Dana Shapiro. \u201cFor the most part, they\u2019ve all paused on their plans to do that, which is a really huge setback for folks that have prepped their fields. It means everything [unwanted] is going to grow back, and in Hawaii things grow so quickly. If you don\u2019t plant it right away, you\u2019ve lost all that work.\u201d",
      "The co-op has also been a supplier to the USDA\u2019s Local Food in Schools program that recently saw budget cuts. \u201cFederal cuts to these programs will have a huge impact on the co-op and our farmers, as well as on the local community of kids and underserved families, who have benefited from receiving fresh, healthy local food,\u201d Shapiro said.",
      "Miyamoto and other local agricultural leaders spent the past week meeting with the USDA and other agencies in Washington, D.C., as part of a delegation to Congress. While they got clarification on some programs, like the continuation of the Environmental Quality Incentives Program, they did not on others. He continues to ask the state Legislature for money to make up for the federal loss, but he knows it\u2019s an uphill battle with so many sectors needing funds.",
      "Makua, meanwhile, is figuring out where to turn next. \u201cIf this is the road to success, it\u2019s going to be a resilient road, and the humans that will come out of our program at least will be more than resilient,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we might pivot. We don\u2019t know. We\u2019ll see what the summer brings.\u201d"

      "\u201cThis is not related to student protests,\u201d the Department of Homeland Security said in a statement. \u201cThe individual in question was arrested after a visa revocation by the State Dept. related to a prior criminal history for a DUI.\u201d",
      "News of the student\u2019s detention \u2014 and the lack of an official explanation \u2014 sparked student protests and expressions of concern from university and political leaders. Gov. Tim Walz told reporters Monday that he spoke with Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem about it Friday and was waiting for further details.",
      "Meanwhile, officials at Minnesota State University Mankato said Monday that one of their students had been detained by ICE as well.",
      "President Edward Inch said in a letter to the campus community that the student was detained Friday at an off-campus residence.",
      "\u201cNo reason was given. The University has received no information from ICE, and they have not requested any information from us,\u201d Inch wrote. \u201cI have contacted our elected officials to share my concerns and ask for their help in stopping this activity within our community of learners.\u201d",
      "The Mankato school did not name the student, nor give the student\u2019s nationality or field of study. ICE did not immediately respond to a request for details on that case.",
      "\u201cThis is becoming a deeply concerning pattern, where ICE detains students with little to no explanation ... and ignores their rights to due process,\u201d U.S. Sen. Tina Smith said in a statement. \u201cI will keep pressing the administration for answers about these arrests and work to get answers from federal immigration authorities about this case.\u201d",
      "The University of Minnesota has not named its student either.",
      "That student, who was detained at an off-campus residence Thursday, was enrolled in the business school on the Minneapolis campus. University spokesperson Andria Waclawski said the school had no further updates Monday. She said earlier that they were following the lead of the student and respecting their request for privacy, while providing the student with legal aid and other supports.",
      "The governor said Monday that, \u201cA deep concern is, here, that no matter what the situation was, in this country, everyone has due process rights and our concern is whether those due process rights are being followed.\u201d",
      "The Trump administration has cited a seldom-invoked statute authorizing the secretary of state to revoke visas of noncitizens who could be considered a threat to foreign policy interests. More than half a dozen people with ties to universities are known to have been taken into custody or deported in recent weeks. Most of those detainees have shown support for Palestinian causes during campus protests over Israel\u2019s war in Gaza."

      "Hooters, like other casual dining restaurants, has\u00a0struggled\u00a0in recent years due to inflation, the high costs of labor and food and declining spending by cash-strapped American consumers.

      "\u201cThey said if you don\u2019t like what you\u2019re paid, you can go home,\u201d Sanchez said.",

      "This month, Sanchez began mobilizing her fellow workers to attend a march she was leading Monday, C\u00e9sar Ch\u00e1vez Day.",
      "Sixty years after the historic Delano grape strike, which launched Ch\u00e1vez\u2019s 280-mile march to Sacramento with Filipino American and Mexican American farmworkers, over 5,000 United Farm Worker members and other union members gathered Monday in Delano for a march to the Forty Acres site where Ch\u00e1vez held his first public fast.",
      "This year's march focused on the Trump administration\u2019s recent immigration policies, in the hope that the rally, called \u201ccon estas manos,\u201d or \u201cwith these hands,\u201d reminds people about the workers who grow and pick their food.",
      "Farmworkers in California, who grow one-third of the country\u2019s vegetables and three-fourths of its fruits and nuts, have reported growing fear and anxiety over a series of Immigration and Customs Enforcement arrests and deportations in the Central Valley. Around half of California\u2019s farmworkers are undocumented, according to a study by the University of California, Irvine, and according to the U.S. Agriculture Department, about 42% nationwide lack legal immigration status.",
      "UFW Secretary Treasurer Armando Elenes said those numbers tend to be underreported. \u201cWe estimate it\u2019s closer to 60 or 70 percent undocumented farmworkers\" in California, he said.",
      "Elenes said ICE has detained and deported around 200 farmworkers in Kern County. He said that calling for more temporary work visas isn't enough and that there's a need for broader labor protections for workers who fear being rounded up and separated from their families.",
      "\u201cWe need to push back on the federal government. We need state and local laws that give our workers sick days, heat protection and health care,\u201d he said.",

      "\u201cBeing here is like coming home for me \u2014 I grew up with my parents working for United Farm Workers, and I know the fight is not about the grapes or the lettuce, but it\u2019s about the people,\u201d said Bonta, who was born in the Philippines and whose mother helped organize Filipino and Mexican farmworkers.",
      "The march allowed farmworkers like Gabriel Leal, who picks grapes and cherries, to feel supported by the turnout. ICE rounded up a few of his friends during the January raids.",
      "\u201cThey were stationed along the roads, stopping anyone,\u201d he said. \u201cEven if we\u2019re afraid, we have to go into work \u2014 without us, who\u2019s going to feed our families? Who\u2019s going to feed our country?\u201d",

      "\u201cA part of me understands the worries and concerns from the larger community around increased police presence,\u201d said Dominguez, a water and agriculture attorney. \u201cBut from what I\u2019ve seen, it\u2019s the bad guys that are being taken, and that makes our Latino families safer.\u201d",
      "Dominguez, who is also the vice president of the Kern County Farm Bureau, said he's listening to growers, ranchers and farmworkers but doesn\u2019t believe the immigration measures have stopped any of them from being able to do their jobs.",
      "\u201cThese workers have to make money, so not going to work is not an option,\u201d Dominguez said.",
      "During the march, C\u00e9sar Ch\u00e1vez\u2019s son Paul Chavez said the point of the mobilization isn\u2019t to change people\u2019s minds. \u201cWe\u2019re gathering people who want to stand up to racism and xenophobia to show that there are people who are on their side,\u201d he said.",

    "summary": "Trump has ruled out tariffs on vehicles built entirely in the U.S., but industry executives and analysts say there\u2019s not a single one with all-domestic parts and assembly.",
    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump suggested over the weekend that consumers could dodge his sweeping 25% tariffs on foreign vehicles and auto parts by buying cars made entirely in the United States. The only problem: There aren\u2019t any.",
      "\u201cIf you make your car in the United States, you\u2019re going to make a lot of money,\u201d he told NBC News in an interview Saturday. \u201cIf you don\u2019t, you\u2019re going to have to probably come to the United States, because if you make your car in the United States, there is no tariff.\u201d",
      "Trump, who is set to announce a new tranche of broad-based tariffs Wednesday, said he \u201ccouldn\u2019t care less\u201d if automakers raise prices to offset the costs of the import taxes and denied recent reporting that he\u2019d threatened industry executives not to do so.",
      "Even U.S.-assembled automobiles by major American brands rely heavily on complex global supply chains for the roughly 30,000 parts that make up the average car. Overall, the percentage of auto parts that are sourced abroad hovers around 40%, said Dan Ives, the global head of technology research at Wedbush Securities, a financial services firm.",
      "\u201cU.S.-made cars with all U.S. parts is a fictional tale,\u201d Ives said.",
      "Ivan Drury, director of insights at Edmunds, put it no less bluntly, telling NBC News this month, \u201cThere\u2019s no vehicle where every single component is manufactured from the ground up in the United States.\u201d",
      "A senior automotive executive, who asked to speak anonymously to avoid disrupting sensitive negotiations with the Trump administration, expressed concerns about the industry\u2019s ability to adapt to tariffs because of manufacturers\u2019 extensive supply chains abroad. Even though many vehicles \u2014 both American and foreign \u2014\u00a0are assembled domestically, they\u2019re built using lots of parts that aren\u2019t made in U.S. factories.",
      "Consumers could see price hikes of $4,000 to $12,500 per car because of tariffs, depending on the vehicle, according to a recent estimate by Anderson Economic Group, a consultancy that has worked for major automakers.",
      "A White House spokesperson pointed to the president\u2019s previous statements that the best way for automakers to avoid tariffs is to build in America. The administration is also calling for tax breaks to incentivize purchases of U.S.-made vehicles and pursuing deregulation to lower industrywide costs, the spokesperson said.",
      "Automakers are required by law to report the makeup of their car models to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, which publishes a list each year. The report, mandated by the American Automobile Labeling Act, includes the percentage of parts that are sourced outside the United States and Canada, as well as the country of final assembly and the source of the vehicle\u2019s motor and transmission. Drury said the list can be a handy guide for shoppers looking to see how exposed to tariffs a given model might be.",
      "The 2025 Kia EV6, for example, is made of 80% U.S. and Canadian parts, according to the NHTSA\u2019s list, making the South Korean vehicle one of the most North American-made of any global automaker. Most other models have far lower percentages of U.S. and Canadian parts, though the law doesn\u2019t require automakers to differentiate between components sourced in the United States and those from Canada \u2014\u00a0potentially limiting the list\u2019s utility to shoppers, given Canada might face blanket tariffs of up to 25% on most goods as soon as Wednesday.",
      "Even Tesla, which is run by multibillionaire Trump adviser Elon Musk and assembles its vehicles in the United States, sources 20% to 25% of its parts from Mexico, according to the NHTSA list. Over 175 models from foreign automakers like Toyota, Volvo and BMW \u2014 many of which also build some vehicles in the United States \u2014\u00a0are made entirely abroad.",
      "Automotive supply chains are robust, but they can also be fragile when there are shocks to the system, said Amy Broglin-Peterson, a supply chain expert at the Broad College of Business at Michigan State University. For decades, U.S. companies have offshored parts of their manufacturing operations, relying on factories in China, Mexico and other countries where labor is cheaper.",
      "Any tariffs on those foreign-made parts could add up, she said, especially within North America, where manufacturing is relatively integrated and items cross borders multiple times.",
      "\u201cI actually see the parts tariffs to be more of a risk factor than a finished vehicle tariff,\u201d Broglin-Peterson said.",
      "Moving more of automakers\u2019 supply chains to the United States is possible, she said, and it could achieve the Trump administration\u2019s national security goals while bolstering domestic manufacturing in the long run. But that could take years.",
      "\u201cEstablishing a presence here, from a manufacturing perspective, is not a short order,\u201d she said. \u201cIt comes with a very lengthy timeline. It comes with a heavy cost.\u201d"

      "Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., said Monday when he was asked whether he believes Trump, 78, can serve a third term: \"Not without a change in the Constitution.\u201d",

      "\u201cI\u2019ve known him for a long time, and I consider him a friend, Mullin told NBC News.",
      "Asked whether he would object if Trump sought a third term, Mullin replied: \u201cI don\u2019t play hypotheticals, guys.\u201d",
      "Across the Capitol in the House, Majority Leader Steve Scalise, R-La., dismissed the idea, suggesting that Trump floats ideas and concepts not necessarily with the hope of achieving them but to get discussions going.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know what he was referring to. I never saw it,\u201d Scalise said when he was asked about Trump\u2019s comments.\u00a0\u201cBut, you know, you see it like with Greenland, like with Panama Canal. There\u2019s a lot of things the president talks about. Ultimately, it gets people talking and addresses some other issues, too.\u201d",
      "Pressed whether he would support changing the Constitution to let Trump run for\u00a0a third term, Scalise quickly dismissed the idea. \u201cThere\u2019s no proposal to change the Constitution right now,\" he said.",
      "But at least one Republican is taking Trump seriously \u2014 and literally \u2014 about a potential third term. Rep. Andy Ogles, of Tennessee, introduced a constitutional amendment three days after Trump was sworn in this year. The amendment would allow presidents to serve a maximum of three terms, with the caveat that the president would no longer be eligible after having been elected to two consecutive terms.",
      "\"He has proven himself to be the only figure in modern history capable of reversing our nation\u2019s decay and restoring America to greatness, and he must be given the time necessary to accomplish that goal,\" Ogles said upon introducing the measure.",
      "The measure is extremely unlikely to pass, as it would require the support of two-thirds of the House and the Senate, as well as three-fourths of state legislatures. Democrats could easily block it in Congress.",
      "\"The Constitution isn\u2019t optional, sir. This isn\u2019t a reality show \u2014 it\u2019s reality. Two terms, that\u2019s it,\" Rep. Jasmine Crockett, D-Texas, said on X in response to Trump's comments.",
      "In recent months, Trump has repeatedly raised the specter of a third term. During House Republicans' Jan. 27 retreat at Trump's resort in Doral, Florida, he mused before the television cameras about another term in the White House.",
      "Specifically, Trump asked Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., a former constitutional lawyer: \u201cAm I allowed to run again?\u201d",
      "But he quickly added, \u201cMike, I better not get you involved in that.\"",
      "The remarks elicited laugher from Johnson and other Republicans in the room, who brushed it off as a joke. It \u201cwas clearly tongue in cheek,\" Johnson said the next day.",

    "summary": "Karen Read's murder trial in the death of Boston police officer John O'Keefe ended with a hung jury. Jury selection in her retrial starts this week.",
    "story": [
      "During a long and widely watched trial last year, Karen Read was prosecuted for murder in the 2022 death of her boyfriend, Boston Police Officer John O\u2019Keefe.",
      "The trial, which included allegations of police misconduct and of a wide-ranging conspiracy among law enforcement officers to frame Read in the killing, ended in a hung jury.",
      "Jury selection in Read\u2019s retrial on charges of second-degree murder, motor vehicle manslaughter while driving under the influence and leaving the scene of a collision causing death is set to begin Tuesday in a courtroom outside Boston.",
      "Here\u2019s what to know about the case.",
      "How did John O\u2019Keefe die?",
      "O\u2019Keefe, 46, had been a police officer for 16 years. He was found unresponsive on a snowy January morning outside the suburban home of Brian Albert, a now-retired Boston police sergeant.",
      "O\u2019Keefe was pronounced dead shortly after, and the medical examiner attributed the cause to blunt force trauma to the head and hypothermia. Read, then an equity analyst who had been dating O\u2019Keefe for two years, was arrested in connection with his death days later.",
      "When Read was tried in 2024, the Norfolk County District Attorney\u2019s Office pointed to the couple\u2019s troubled relationship as a possible motive in the killing and accused her of striking O\u2019Keefe outside the sergeant\u2019s home with her Lexus SUV after a night of heavy drinking.",
      "The death was not captured on camera, and no eyewitnesses claimed to have seen what happened. But Assistant District Attorney Adam Lally told the jury that vehicle data from Read\u2019s SUV showed her traveling backward for 60 feet at 24 mph outside Albert\u2019s home around the time that she was dropping O\u2019Keefe off at a party there.",
      "O\u2019Keefe\u2019s hair was found on the vehicle\u2019s bumper, and his DNA was  on the SUV\u2019s broken taillight, Lally told the jury. The remnants of a cocktail he appeared to have left a bar with earlier that night were also found on the bumper, as were bits of what Lally described as a drinking glass.",
      "What did the defense say?",
      "Read asserted her innocence and her defense team accused Albert and others who\u2019d been at the party \u2014 including an agent with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives whom Read had exchanged flirty texts with \u2014 of fatally assaulting O\u2019Keefe and framing Read for the killing. (Albert testified that O\u2019Keefe never came inside his home but that he would have been \u201cwelcomed with open arms\u201d if he had.)",
      "The defense also accused the lead investigator in the case, Massachusetts State Trooper Michael Proctor, of manipulating evidence and conducting a biased investigation. Text messages introduced at trial showed Proctor using offensive and derogatory language to describe Read to family, friends and supervisors.",
      "Proctor had undisclosed ties to Albert and his family, Read\u2019s lawyers said, and he shared investigative details with his sister, who was close friends with Albert\u2019s sister-in-law.",
      "Proctor acknowledged discussing the case with his sister, though he said he shared only \u201cnewsworthy stuff,\u201d and he testified that his unprofessional language \u201cdehumanized\u201d Read. But he said his conduct did not compromise the integrity of the investigation into O\u2019Keefe\u2019s death.",
      "After a nine-week trial and five days of deliberations, a jury was unable to reach a unanimous verdict, and Norfolk County Superior Court Judge Beverly Cannone declared a mistrial.",
      "What happened next?",
      "Days later, the Massachusetts State Police placed Proctor on unpaid leave over what the agency described as allegations of \u201cserious misconduct\u201d raised at trial. The trooper was fired last month after a state police trial board examined the allegations and found that he had violated agency rules by sending derogatory and defamatory texts about Read and shared sensitive investigative details with non-law enforcement personnel.",
      "Proctor also drank while on duty and drove his cruiser, according to the trial board\u2019s findings.",
      "Proctor has not publicly commented on his termination, but his family said the text messages \u201cprove one thing, and that Michael is human \u2014 not corrupt, not incompetent in his role as a homicide detective, and certainly not unfit to continue to be a Massachusetts State Trooper.\u201d",
      "\u201cDespite the Massachusetts State Police\u2019s dubious and relentless efforts to find more inculpatory evidence against Michael Proctor on his phones, computers and cruiser data, the messages on his personal phone \u2014 referring to the person who killed a fellow beloved Boston Police Officer \u2014 are all that they found,\u201d the family said.",
      "Separately, Read\u2019s attorneys tried to have the case thrown out over claims that Read was the victim of \u201cextraordinary governmental misconduct.\u201d They also claimed her retrial amounted to double jeopardy because, after the mistrial, two jurors told the defense team that the panel would have acquitted Read of murder and leaving the scene of a collision causing death.",
      "Prosecutors disputed those claims and judges have denied both claims.",
      "What will be different in a second trial?",
      "The prosecution tapped Hank Brennan, a former prosecutor and longtime criminal defense attorney who represented Boston gangster James \u201cWhitey\u201d Bulger, to retry the case as special counsel and lead prosecutor.",
      "The defense team also added a lawyer \u2014 Victoria George, who served as an alternate juror during the first trial. \u201cI waited for nearly a year after the mistrial, hoping the court system would work as intended to remedy some of the wrongs in this case,\u201d she told Vanity Fair magazine.",
      "It isn\u2019t clear what role Proctor will play. He has appeared on witness lists filed by both the defense and prosecution, but legal experts said that his termination adds a level of uncertainty to the proceedings.",
      "\u201cAt the time of his original testimony, he still had a job to rein him in,\u201d Stara Roemer, a former Dallas County prosecutor who is now a criminal defense lawyer in Texas, told NBC News. \u201cNow that he no longer has that job, who knows what could come out of his mouth.\u201d",
      "Also included on an amended witness list from the prosecution are three of Read\u2019s attorneys \u2014 Alan Jackson, David Yanetti and Elizabeth Little.",
      "\u201cIt may be necessary to call defense counsels to authenticate the defendant\u2019s numerous public statements,\u201d prosecutors said in the filing, according to NBC Boston."

    "story": [
      "Time is running out for Jos\u00e9 Alfredo Pacheco, a dialysis patient in Illinois who needs a lifesaving kidney transplant. His donor and brother, Jos\u00e9 Gregorio Gonz\u00e1lez, has been in an immigration detention center for nearly a month and is at risk of being deported to Venezuela.",
      "Community members in the Chicago area have been rallying in support of the brothers. They're gathering at a vigil Monday evening organized by The Resurrection Project, a Chicago-based nonprofit group representing the brothers, to demand Gonz\u00e1lez's release on humanitarian parole so he can donate a kidney to his sick brother.",
      "With deportation flights to Venezuela resuming following a brief suspension on March 8, \"there's incredible urgency because Jos\u00e9 Gregorio could be deported at any time now,\" Tovia Siegel, director of organizing and leadership at The Resurrection Project's Immigrant Justice Department, told NBC News. The group is providing legal representation to Gonz\u00e1lez.",
      "Gonz\u00e1lez, 43, arrived in the United States from Venezuela last year to reunite with his brother, who was diagnosed with end-stage renal disease, or kidney failure, in December 2023. Since then, Gonz\u00e1lez had been caring for his younger brother. They share the same mother.",
      "Pacheco, 37, goes to a center three times a week at 4 a.m. for four-hour dialysis sessions. On March 3, he was returning home from his dialysis session and Gonz\u00e1lez greeted him with breakfast, Siegel said. After having eaten, Gonz\u00e1lez stepped outside his home and was approached by several Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents, who arrested him and took him to the Clay County Detention Center in Indiana, where he is being held.",
      "Gonz\u00e1lez sought asylum in the United States. But after he did not pass an initial credible fear interview, immigration authorities placed a deportation order on him. He was still allowed to remain in the United States under ICE supervision, which is not uncommon.",
      "Siegel said ICE was aware of Gonz\u00e1lez\u2019s location because he had been wearing a GPS ankle monitor as part of his order of supervision. ICE uses such orders to place immigrants in one of its supervision programs, allowing it to monitor and keep tabs on undocumented people. The programs, which are meant to serve as alternatives to detention, help immigration officials keep track of those who are not priorities for deportation or need more time to seek legal alternatives to remain in the United States. According to ICE, nearly 179,000 people are being monitored through such programs nationwide.",
      "Siegel said Gonz\u00e1lez has no criminal record and had been complying with the requirements of his order of supervision since he was first placed in the program last year when he entered the United States.",
      "\u201cHe was really here taking care of his brother and preparing to donate his kidney to his brother,\u201d she said.",
      "ICE and DHS did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "Without Gonz\u00e1lez\u2019s kidney donation, Pacheco will most likely need to wait years to receive a transplant, according to a letter from Pacheco\u2019s doctors obtained by NBC News.",
      "\"The waiting time on the cadaver kidney transplant waiting list for Mr. Pacheco is about 4 to 5 years in his blood group. Unfortunately, the mortality on dialysis while waiting for kidney transplantation is extremely high,\" the letter reads. \"Living donor kidney transplantation ensures the highest chance of survival.\"",
      "Gonz\u00e1lez is the living kidney donor Pacheco desperately needs, because, according to the letter, even in the case of blood group incompatibility with his brother, Gonz\u00e1lez could secure a transplant for Pacheco by participating in a paired kidney exchange, which connects pairs of compatible recipients and donors.",
      "Participating in a paired kidney exchange means Gonz\u00e1lez could save two lives, his brother's and a second kidney recipient's, Siegel said. \"So there are multiple lives, multiple families being harmed, being separated and being denied the lifesaving medical care they need if Jos\u00e9 Gregorio is deported.",
      "\"I think it speaks to Jos\u00e9 Gregorio's character,\" Siegel added. \u201cIt\u2019s under ICE\u2019s discretion whether or not to release him, even temporarily, for him to be able to save Alfredo\u2019s life.\u201d",
      "Gonz\u00e1lez told Telemundo Chicago in Spanish last week in a phone call from inside the detention center: \u201cI hope I can go out and achieve that goal of giving my kidney to my brother. I hope he has a lot of faith and patience that we will soon be together and do the transplant.\"",
      "In the same interview, Pacheco told Telemundo Chicago he feels like \"the world fell on me\" since ICE detained his brother. \"Give my brother a chance and me a chance to continue living.\u201d"

    "summary": "The S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq logged their worst performance since Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine slammed into the global economy.",
    "story": [
      "Two of the three major U.S. stock indexes just wrapped up their worst quarter in well over two years. The third barely avoided the same fate.",
      "The S&P 500 dropped more than 4.5% for the first quarter of 2025 as of Monday\u2019s close, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq plummeted 10.4%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average settled 1.3% lower and recorded its first back-to-back monthly loss since October 2023.",
      "The declines on all three indexes come days before President Donald Trump is set to unveil a new slate of wide-ranging tariffs, extending ongoing trade policy turmoil that has kept investors guessing for months.",
      "The broad-based S&P 500 fell briefly into correction territory Monday, meaning a 10% slide from its last high. The index regained some ground late in the day, but not enough to dodge its worst monthly percentage drop since December 2022.",
      "The index\u2019s first-quarter stumbles ended a streak of five straight winning quarters, while the Nasdaq wiped out more than half of last year\u2019s gains over the last three months. Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet, Nvidia, Tesla and Meta, known on Wall Street as the \u201cmagnificent 7,\u201d have lost more than $2 trillion in market value collectively since the start of the year.",
      "The last time U.S. markets stumbled as badly was in the middle of 2022 after Russia\u2019s late-February invasion of Ukraine, shocking the global economy as Western nations hit Moscow with severe sanctions and commodities like oil and grains shot up in price.",
      "The first quarter of this year saw geopolitical upheaval of a different sort, as investors have struggled to digest the series of major U.S. policy changes since Inauguration Day. The quarter marked the S&P\u2019s worst performance versus the rest of the world since 1980, according to Dow Jones\u00a0\u2014 at a time when a number of foreign stock markets have surged.",
      "The Euro Stoxx 600 index, which tracks companies across 17 countries, has risen 5% to start the year as the S&P 500 dropped by roughly the same amount. In fact, the Stoxx 600 has just had its best quarter against the S&P since 2015, according to FactSet data. The U.K.\u2019s FTSE 100 also rose more than 5% in the same period. The MSCI China index, a benchmark of 580 Chinese stocks, ended the first quarter up 16%.",
      "Markets overseas have popped for a range of reasons, with some but not all related to the Trump administration\u2019s actions. The European Union and U.K. have taken steps to trim regulations and hike military spending in response to White House moves, boosting shares of defense companies in both places and helping power markets there overall. In China, the strong performance has been more a reflection of local factors, including economic stimulus and enthusiasm around home-grown AI startups.",
      "It\u2019s not a rosy picture everywhere, though. Japan\u2019s flagship stock index sank 10% in the first quarter over fears about slowing manufacturing and an export economy that could be hurt by Trump\u2019s still-expanding tariff agenda.",
      "The president is set to open another front in his trade war Wednesday, a date he has dubbed America\u2019s \u201cLiberation Day\u201d from the purported abuses of its top trading partners, many of them longtime allies. Trump has vowed so-called reciprocal tariffs aimed at equalizing trade barriers between the U.S. and a number of countries that sell to Americans more of their own goods and services than those they buy from the U.S.",
      "But with the details of this policy program still up in the air days before it\u2019s set to roll out, business leaders and consumers have been grappling with widespread uncertainty over the coming impact. Nearly 900 nonfinancial companies mentioned tariffs on recent earnings calls, S&P Global Market Intelligence said this month.",
      "\u201cThis is truly ridiculous,\u201d one manufacturing executive said in an anonymous Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas survey published Monday. \u201cI have been in business for 50 years as of next year, and never have I seen such uncertainty in the market. It is very difficult to plan and make decisions.\u201d",
      "But things could still turn around in the months ahead, some analysts say.",
      "\u201cOnce tariffs are announced on April 2, negotiations to soften them can begin,\u201d researchers at the investment bank UBS said in a note to clients Monday. \u201cProgress toward a budget reconciliation bill could refocus attention on market-positive aspects of the Trump agenda.\u201d"

      "Welcome to the online version of\u00a0From the Politics Desk, an evening newsletter that brings you the NBC News Politics team\u2019s latest reporting and analysis from the White House, Capitol Hill and the campaign trail.",
      "In today\u2019s edition, Steve Kornacki dives into how Democrats may be able to cut into the GOP\u2019s margins in a deep-red Florida House district in tomorrow\u2019s special election. Plus, we have more key numbers to know there and in Wisconsin ahead of a big state Supreme Court race.",
      "Sign up to receive this newsletter in your inbox every weekday here.",
      "\u2014 Adam Wollner",
      "Why Republicans are at risk of underperforming in a Florida special election",
      "No Democrat in America won a House seat last year in a district even remotely as pro-Trump as the two in Florida where special elections will be held Tuesday.",
      "Trump carried Florida\u2019s 1st District by 37 points and the 6th District by 30 points in 2024, according to NBC News\u2019 Decision Desk. The biggest margin for a Democratic-held seat that Trump won at the presidential level was 9 points, coming in Rep. Jared Golden\u2019s 2nd District in Maine.",
      "So a Democratic win in either Florida race would be beyond stunning. The suspense is more about whether the party can take a bite out of those giant Trump margins and claim political momentum early in his second administration.",
      "This is particularly the case in the 6th District, where Democrat Josh Weil has outraised Republican Randy Fine by a staggering margin and where early voting has hinted at an energized Democratic base \u2014 a dynamic that has been a pattern in special elections during the Trump era. And last year\u2019s presidential election results from the district suggest there\u2019s plenty of room for slippage for the GOP and overperformance from the Democrats.",
      "Much of this is due to the growth in Trump\u2019s support from nonwhite voters, many of whom were younger and first-time voters without a history of participating in lower-turnout special elections. In November, they helped boost Trump\u2019s margin in Florida\u2019s 6th District by 6 points, from 24 points in 2020 up to 30. The two places where Trump gained the most new ground are significantly less white and less affluent than the district as a whole.",
      "In Florida\u2019s 6th District, Trump\u2019s gains with nonwhite voters seem to have come in both heavily Latino and heavily Black areas. In precincts that are majority Black, he cut the Democratic margin from 53 points in 2020 down to 41, a 12-point improvement. The biggest single precinct-level shift toward Trump in the district (a net-gain of 57 points) came in a precinct that is 52% Black.",
      "A key question that emerged from 2024 is whether these types of gains are sustainable for Republicans without Trump on the ballot. Add in the lower-profile nature of this election and the task becomes that much tougher.",
      "Meanwhile, Trump\u2019s gains were minimal in areas with higher concentrations of white, college-educated and affluent voters. It is among this demographic mix that Democrats have found their most energized supporters nationally during the Trump era. And given that turnout will be much lower on Tuesday than in November, an exercised cohort of anti-Trump, college-educated, white voters could punch well above its weight. The district also has plenty of retirees, and in areas where the average age is over 55, Trump only gained about two points last November.",
      "This might not all add up to a Democratic win, but it could knock some points off that 30-point Trump margin.",
      "Stay tuned tomorrow for Steve\u2019s breakdown of the key areas to watch in Wisconsin for the state Supreme Court election.",
      "Tuesday's elections by the numbers",
      "Outside of the Florida special elections, a state Supreme Court race in Wisconsin on Tuesday will also have major national implications.",
      "Here are the key numbers to know that have shaped these elections.",
      "A deluge of TV ads: The vast majority of the $80 million-plus spent since Jan. 1 on TV in these off-year elections has been in Wisconsin, where the contest between two state judges, Susan Crawford and Brad Schimel, has been the most expensive state Supreme Court race in history, surpassing Wisconsin\u2019s 2023 campaign.",
      "Wisconsin has seen more than $70 million in TV ads on the court race (plus a bit more on other races on the ballot), according to the ad-tracking firm AdImpact. Meanwhile, the special election in Florida\u2019s 1st District has seen $3.4 million in ads, and the one in the 6th District has seen $6.2 million through Election Day.",
      "Elon Musk\u2019s spending: Billionaire White House adviser Elon Musk has played a major role in the uptick in spending in the Wisconsin Supreme Court race.",
      "Musk\u2019s super PAC, America PAC, has spent $12.2 million and counting to boost Schimel. Musk also donated another $3 million to the state Republican Party. And he gave away million-dollar checks to petition signers at a recent event in Wisconsin ahead of Tuesday\u2019s elections.",
      "Meanwhile, another group with links to Musk, the nonprofit Building America\u2019s Future, has also spent $4.8 million in Wisconsin. (It\u2019s unclear whether Musk is currently supporting that group.)",
      "The biggest liberal-aligned group in the Wisconsin race has been A Better Wisconsin Together, which has spent $8.4 million to benefit Crawford.",
      "Musk\u2019s America PAC has also gotten involved in Florida, but with far smaller sums, dropping nearly $100,000 on phone calls and texts in the two races, according to filings with the Federal Election Commission.",
      "Elon Musk\u2019s posting: Musk isn\u2019t just pouring money into the race; he\u2019s been talking a lot about it, too.",
      "He has posted or reposted 73 times on his X platform about the Wisconsin Supreme Court race this year, as of midday Monday. Most of those posts came in recent weeks, as his money and involvement in the campaign have become a central theme.",

      "A proclamation signed by the governor declares the day is meant to \u201creaffirm our commitment to support, affirm and celebrate New York\u2019s transgender, gender non-conforming, and non-binary\u201d people.",
      "The 15 landmarks to be lit across the state include One World Trade Center in New York City; the Alfred E. Smith State Office Building in the capital city, Albany; Governor Mario M. Cuomo Bridge in Tarrytown; and Niagara Falls.",
      "\u201cNew York is proud to be the birthplace of the LGBTQ+ rights movement, with trailblazers like Marsha P. Johnson, whose courage and leadership sparked the fight for equality,\u201d Hochul said in a news release Monday. \u201cWhile the Trump administration is attacking the existence of trans people through harmful policies and rhetoric, New York remains a beacon of hope and acceptance. On Transgender Day of Visibility, we honor the strength and resilience of the transgender community.\u201d",
      "Marsha P. Johnson was a longtime trans activist best known for her role in the 1969 Stonewall uprising and for her work supporting transgender women of color, particularly co-founding the trans advocacy group Street Transvestite Action Revolutionaries.",
      "In February, references to transgender and queer people were removed from the Stonewall National Monument\u2019s webpage, and \u201cLGBTQ+\u201d was shortened to \u201cLGB\u201d on the National Park Service\u2019s website. The changes came after President Donald Trump signed an executive order declaring that the U.S. government would only recognize two unchangeable sexes, male and female.",
      "\u201cAs one of the only LBGTQ+ members of the State Senate, and the Senator representing the historic Stonewall Inn, I often think about how I would not be the person I am today if not for the courageous trans women who sparked the modern LGBTQ rights movement right here in my district,\u201d state Sen. Brad Hoylman-Sigal said in the news release. \u201cThe incessant attacks on the trans community by the federal government are deeply disturbing, but fortunately New York State has leaders who understand the importance of accepting people for who they are.\u201d",

      "Each bat must be approved by Major League Baseball, though they're all slightly different, as manufacturers and players have gone back and forth about weight distribution for individual batters.",
      "But for the most part, the hitter\u2019s sweet spot of a 34-inch-long bat \u2014 where batters hope to connect with maximum acceleration and mass \u2014 is several inches down from the end and just above where the manufacturer's label is marked.",
      "Where the bats seen in Yankee Stadium over the weekend differ is the additional weight at the sweet spot \u2014 and just below that traditional zone, going toward a batter\u2019s hands.",
      "A pitcher\u2019s goal, aside from striking out a batter, is to induce weak contact.",
      "That\u2019s often done with a pitch breaking horizontally as a batter swings in the belief he\u2019ll connect with the sweet spot before the ball ends up closer to his hands, in contact that\u2019s colloquially called getting \u201cjammed.\u201d",
      "A typical MLB game will feature at least one broken bat \u2014 the ultimate result of a batter\u2019s being \u201cjammed\u201d \u2014 in what's probably the second biggest thrill for a pitcher, aside from a strikeout.",
      "So when Yankees researchers found that shortstop Anthony Volpe had a propensity for getting jammed, as YES network play-by-play announcer Michael Kay explained over the weekend, the answer was to turn that weakness into a potential strength by moving more mass down the bat.",
      "'You're always looking for the slightest edge'",
      "Former Yankees infielder Kevin Smith, who along with Kay brought the issue to light over the weekend, said torpedo bats are the next natural step in baseball technology.",
      "\"You know, in baseball, you\u2019re always looking for the slightest edge,\" Smith who is retired, told NBC News on Monday.",
      "\"I mean, pitchers have been doing it forever. You know, there\u2019s been a bunch of bat technology that has come out that is helping hitters,\" he said. \"This is just kind of the next step, but we\u2019ll see.\"",
      "That extra bit of mass put in a spot that would normally result in weak contact off the handle could make all the difference.",
      "\"We can put wood in places where you don\u2019t hit the ball, or we can put wood where it matters the most,\" Smith said, \"and so taking a little bit of wood off the end where you really don\u2019t want to hit the ball at all and putting it into a spot where you might make more contact and do more damage.\"",
      "Philadelphia second baseman Bryson Stott said the torpedo bat isn't for everyone and that it will benefit only hitters who are perpetually being jammed and have thousands of points of data to prove it.",
      "\"If you hit it off the end, with that torpedo bat, you're in trouble,\" he told reporters Monday. \"So it's mostly where you hit it and where all their computers and things are telling you where you're hitting it.\"",
      "The bats were innovated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology-educated physicist Aaron Leanhardt, a former Yankees analyst who was hired as the Miami Marlins\u2019 field coordinator this past winter.",
      "Leanhardt declined comment Monday as his innovation was the talk of the game.",
      "'Revolutionary' or 'clever innovation'?",
      "David Pritchard, an MIT physics professor and onetime teacher of Leanhardt, said Leanhardt was always intellectually curious.",
      "\"Baseball is a very traditional game, and if you get up there with a funny-looking bat and you strike out, when you go back to the dugout, what's going to happen? You're going to get razzed by the other teammates, right?\" Pritchard said.",
      "\"It just takes some outsiders, like Aaron, who has a Ph.D. from MIT and really understands physics and knows what's going on, to be the sort of guy who drives something under the radar and see if it works,\" he said.",
      "Yankees like Volpe, Jazz Chisholm Jr., Cody Bellinger, Paul Goldschmidt and Austin Wells\u00a0will perhaps have an early upper hand with the new bats.",
      "In the three-game demolition of Milwaukee, they were a red-hot 18-for-59 (.305) combined, with nine long balls.",
      "California Institute of Technology president, quantum physicist and baseball fan Thomas Rosenbaum expects pitchers to adjust quickly and find new ways to attack those hitters.",
      "\"I don't think it's revolutionary, but it's a clever innovation,\" Rosenbaum said. \"In the short term probably will have larger effects than in the long term would be my prediction.\""

    "story": [
      "A steady stream of money, advertisements and activity from national political figures has flowed into Wisconsin and Florida ahead of elections Tuesday.",
      "The biggest race is for a seat on Wisconsin's Supreme Court, but a pair of congressional special elections in Florida have drawn attention, too. Voters in Wisconsin will also consider a race for state superintendent and a constitutional amendment on voter ID.",
      "Here are the key numbers to know that have shaped these elections.",
      "A deluge of TV ads",
      "The vast majority of the $80 million-plus spent since Jan. 1 on TV in these off-year elections has been in Wisconsin, where the contest between state judges Susan Crawford and Brad Schimel has been the most expensive state Supreme Court race in history, surpassing the state's 2023 campaign.",
      "Wisconsin has seen more than $70 million in TV ads on the court race (plus a bit more on other races on the ballot), according to the ad-tracking firm AdImpact. Meanwhile, the special election in Florida\u2019s 1st District has seen $3.4 million, and the one in the 6th District has seen $6.2 million through Election Day.",
      "Spending related to Elon Musk",
      "Billionaire White House adviser Elon Musk has played a major role in the uptick in spending in the Wisconsin Supreme Court race.",
      "Musk\u2019s super PAC, America PAC, has spent $12.2 million and counting to boost Schimel. He also donated another $3 million to the state Republican Party. And he gave away million-dollar checks to petition signers at a recent event in Wisconsin ahead of Tuesday\u2019s elections.",
      "Meanwhile, another group with links to Musk, the nonprofit Building America\u2019s Future, has spent $4.8 million in Wisconsin. (It\u2019s unclear whether Musk is currently supporting that group.)",
      "The biggest liberal-aligned group in the Wisconsin race has been A Better Wisconsin Together, which has spent $8.4 million to benefit Crawford.",
      "Musk's America PAC has also gotten involved in Florida, but with far smaller sums, dropping nearly $100,000 on phone calls and texts in the two races, according to filings with the Federal Election Commission.",
      "A lot of Musk X posts about Wisconsin",
      "Musk isn't just pouring money into the race; he's been talking a lot about it, too.",
      "He has posted or reposted 73 times on X about the Wisconsin Supreme Court race this year, as of midday Monday. Most of those posts came in recent weeks, as his money and involvement in the campaign have become a central theme.",
      "Musk posted once about the race in January before sending a flurry of social media messages about the race in the last days of March.",
      "Early voting",
      "Early voting is up in Wisconsin compared with the state\u2019s 2023 Supreme Court race, when about 453,000 people voted early or by mail ahead of Election Day. The question is: How many people will show up on Election Day, and what will total turnout look like?",
      "Similarly, the campaigns in the Florida special elections are keeping a close eye on early turnout there, with one county demonstrating why some Republicans have been a bit nervous despite the strong GOP lean of the districts involved.",
      "In Flagler County, Florida \u2014 the only unsplit county in Florida\u2019s 6th Congressional District \u2014 Republicans account for 48% of early votes cast in the special election, virtually in line with Republicans\u2019 49% share of total registered voters in the county.",
      "But Democrats are overperforming their registration in the early vote. While 24% of active Flagler County voters are Democrats, 36% of early voters are registered Democrats. It\u2019s tricky to project anything final from early turnout numbers, but those voting numbers illustrate one reason why Democrats have done relatively well in special elections over the past few years: Their voters participate disproportionately in these contests.",
      "Republican-leaning House districts",
      "Though Republicans have expressed some concern about Democrats' heavy fundraising in the Florida races, these districts are extremely red, giving the GOP candidates a lot of room for error.",
      "President Donald Trump carried the 6th District with 65% of the vote last November, and the 1st District with 68%. But Republicans still must convince their voters to turn out at an unusual time.",
      "A narrow House majority",
      "Republicans hold a narrow 218-213 majority in the House, with four seats vacant (two won by each party in the 2024 election). Recapturing the Florida districts the GOP carried last year will give the party a slightly wider margin as Congress begins serious deliberation of how to advance Trump\u2019s budget and tax proposals this year.",
      "With two wins in Florida, House Republicans would be able to pass bills while losing three or fewer GOP members, if every member voted on the bill. At one point earlier this year, that margin for error was down to a single vote."

    "summary": "Freshwater essential to lithium mining is running low in the world\u2019s \u201cLithium Triangle,\u201d a mineral-rich region in the Andean Plateau that stretches across parts of Argentina, Bolivia and Chile and contains more than half of all global lithium reserves.",
    "story": [
      "Freshwater essential to lithium mining is running low in the world\u2019s \u201cLithium Triangle,\u201d a mineral-rich region in the Andean Plateau that stretches across parts of Argentina, Bolivia and Chile and contains more than half of all global lithium reserves.",
      "In a study published last week in the journal Communications Earth and Environment, researchers found that the amount of freshwater locally available for lithium extraction is about 10 times lower than previous estimates. Global lithium demand, which is expected to grow by 40 times by 2040, could outpace the limited annual rain that supplies freshwater to the arid Lithium Triangle.",
      "The paper\u2019s authors urged the lithium industry to reduce their freshwater usage and avoid disrupting mining operations, which rely heavily on freshwater availability, consuming up to 500,000 gallons of water to extract one ton of lithium. In the Lithium Triangle, freshwater also supports agriculture for small, Indigenous communities and sustains wetlands that are home to short-tailed chinchillas, wild camelids and pink flamingo species found nowhere else in the world.",
      "\u201cWater is the most important resource in these systems, and it\u2019s the part of the system that is most sensitive to change,\u201d David Boutt, an author of the paper and a professor of geosciences at the University of Massachusetts-Amherst, said. \u201cI\u2019m optimistic that, through research and development, companies can be more water efficient, especially when driven by the market.\u201d",
      "While water drives life and industry in the Triangle, lithium is critical to the global regulatory push for electrification and the growth of clean technology industries. The mineral is an essential component for batteries that power electric vehicles and store energy generated by renewable sources like solar panels and windmills.",
      "The need for lithium batteries is projected to quadruple by 2030, according to the International Energy Agency. Some industry experts are concerned that companies will not be able to meet growing demand, as lithium mines face permitting delays and long procedures to bring mines into operation on top of issues with resource availability.",
      "\u201cWe need more lithium sources to come online to meet the demand we\u2019ll see by 2030,\u201d said Michael McKibben, a professor of geology at the University of California, Riverside. \u201cMineral extraction is a slow, tedious process. That\u2019s why prices are so volatile \u2014 demand goes up, but the supply can\u2019t respond instantaneously.\u201d",
      "In the Lithium Triangle, freshwater plays a crucial role in determining the supply of lithium available for mining. Rain washes lithium and other minerals down from rock formations into deep basins carved into the flat Andean Plateau. The process, which takes place over millions of years, creates brackish lagoons filled with lithium-rich waters.",
      "Mining companies extract lithium fluid from the lagoons and concentrate the mineral with evaporation methods \u2014 which use copious freshwater drawn from nearby aquifers. Water levels in these aquifers depend on the annual rains, which can bring as little as 20 millimeters of precipitation (0.8 inches) in some parts of the Lithium Triangle.",
      "Boutt says that limited meteorological data from a lack of weather stations in the remote Andean Plateau has made it difficult to capture how much freshwater actually flows to these lithium-rich lagoons and the surrounding areas. He added that widely used global hydrologic models that rely on this sparse data have vastly overestimated the freshwater supply in the region.",
      "The model developed by Boutt and his team looked at freshwater in 28 different watersheds across the Lithium Triangle, drawing from field observations as well as national meteorological data and mining industry reports. Boutt says that it provides a more complete picture of freshwater flow into the lithium-rich area.",
      "Research on water and resource availability for lithium mining operations has a long way to go. In the U.S., mining operations at the nation\u2019s only operating lithium mine in Silver Peak, Nevada, have been the subject of criticism for significant and prolonged freshwater pumping in the often drought-stricken region.",
      "Vanessa Schenker, a researcher with the Institute of Environmental Engineering at ETH Zurich, a Swiss university, says that there needs to be more research on the hydrology of lithium-rich regions around the world.",
      "\u201cOn top of how much water lithium mines are using, we also need to examine the entire supply chain for lithium and think of components such as chemical processing and transport,\u201d she said. \u201cUnderstanding the Lithium Triangle will help us understand other systems globally.\u201d"

      "The longest-running cast member said that he \u201cdefinitely saw it\u201d when Wallen abruptly walked off the stage. \u201cYou see somebody before you get a chance to say hi or say good job or anything like that, they just dipping.\u201d",
      "\u201cI thought maybe he had to go to the potty or something,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely a spike in the norm. We\u2019re so used to everybody just turning around and high-fiving us, everybody\u2019s saying, \u2018Good job, good job, good job.\u2019 So when there\u2019s a departure from that, it\u2019s like,  \u2018Hmm, I wonder what that\u2019s about?\u2019\u201d",
      "Thompson noted that he \u201cnever met\u201d the \u201cI\u2019m The Problem\u201d singer, but said he \u201cseems like a complicated individual, I guess.\u201d",

      "\u201cPrince\u00a0did the same thing,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cI\u2019m not saying Morgan Wallen is Prince, but we weren\u2019t surprised because Prince was notoriously kind of standoffish. It\u2019s just how he was. So we just thought like, \u2018OK, now he\u2019s gone back into fantasyland.\u2019\u201d",
      "However, he explained that Wallen's actions were definitely felt by everyone on stage.",

      "Adding to Wallen\u2019s questionable actions was the artist\u2019s post on his Instagram story. Wallen posted a photo of a private jet on a tarmac with the words, \u201cGet me to God\u2019s country.\u201d",
      "On March 20, TODAY.com reached out to Wallen\u2019s reps for comment and clarification on his post but did not hear back.",
      "Thompson, on his end, said that Wallen\u2019s post was \u201cstrange\u201d and didn\u2019t understand why he posted it.",
      "\u201cThe \u2018God\u2019s country\u2019 of it all is strange because it\u2019s like, what are you trying to say? You trying to say that we are not in God\u2019s country? We\u2019re not all in God\u2019s country? We\u2019re not all under God\u2019s umbrella? That\u2019s not necessarily my favorite,\u201d he told EW. \u201cBut whatever. Moving on, we got a new show. We got Jack Black this week ... We will be fine.\u201d",
      "Wallen has yet to address the reaction to the way he made his \"SNL\" exit. The singer, however, has a history of controversy that also includes the comedy sketch show.",
      "In October 2020, he was cut as the musical guest after breaking COVID-19 protocols and was seen partying without a mask ahead of his scheduled gig. Wallen was able to rebook his spot in a December show and joked about his canceled performance in a sketch."

      "The Netflix documentary \u201cCon Mum\u201d is the story of one man\u2019s dream-turned-nightmare. Graham Hornigold, a London-based pastry chef, grew up fantasizing about his birth mother. Then in 2020, he says in the documentary, a woman reached out saying she was the mother he never knew.",
      "She said that she \u201cnever stopped loving\u201d Hornigold, he says in the documentary. After a series of specific questions, Hornigold says he was convinced the woman knew enough details about his life to be his mother.",

      "The rest of the documentary follows Hornigold's story, and how he says the woman claiming to be his long-lost mother conned him out of hundreds of thousands of dollars.",
      "The woman claimed she was dying of cancer and wanted to leave her vast fortune to Hornigold, he says in the documentary. Swept up into her world, Hornigold became closer to the woman, ultimately staying with her when his wife and newborn went to New Zealand and helping her pay bills.",
      "Eventually, Hornigold says in the documentary, he awakened to the woman's con. By then, he had given her money \u2014 a total of \u00a3300,000, he says in the documentary \u2014 and his marriage had ended.",
      "The devastating final twist? A DNA test shown at the end of the documentary concludes that the woman was indeed Hornigold\u2019s biological mother.",
      "How did 'Con Mum' happen?",
      "In an interview with TODAY.com, clinical psychologist Natalie Feinblatt, who specializes in trauma recovery for people who\u2019ve left high-control groups and cults, says \u201canyone\u201d is susceptible to scams \u2014 but Hornigold\u2019s origin story left him particularly vulnerable.",
      "Raised by a stepmother and father to whom he is no longer close, Hornigold says he often wondered about his mother growing up. \u201cIt\u2019s quite painful, not knowing your mother. You haven\u2019t got your mum,\u201d he says in the documentary.",
      "\u201cReuniting with a lost parent taps into deep psychological needs for connection and origin,\" Feinblatt says. \"For someone who may already carry questions about identity or belonging, the desire to believe the story can override red flags. Scammers often exploit that window of vulnerability \u2014 not because the victim is naive or foolish, but because they\u2019re human.\u201d",
      "In Hornigold\u2019s case, Feinblatt says the con struck at the the \u201ccore\u201d of his attachment system, an insight he echoes in the documentary.",
      "\u201cThe realization kicks in that this woman is not who she says she is. Because of a cellular level need for acceptance and for a mother, I have been played,\u201d Hornigold says in the documentary.",
      "Dorcy Pruter, a therapist who specializes in parental reunification, tells TODAY.com the maternal connection likely blinded Hornigold to seeing the situation clearly.",
      "\"When someone comes along offering that relief, even if it\u2019s wrapped in red flags, the heart can override the brain.\"",
      "Dorcy Pruter",
      "\u201cPeople with unresolved childhood trauma or identity wounds are especially susceptible because they\u2019re not just looking for answers \u2014 they\u2019re looking for relief. And when someone comes along offering that relief, even if it\u2019s wrapped in red flags, the heart can override the brain,\u201d Pruter says.",
      "For any victim of a scam, Feinblatt emphasizes the healing process can take a long time, because it requires \u201crebuilding a sense of safety and reality\u201d beyond just recovering what has been lost.",
      "Betrayal is accompanied by symptoms like anxiety, depression, hypervigilance and a sense of shame, coupled with the inability to trust instincts.",
      "\u201cPeople often describe feeling like the ground has dropped out from under them \u2014 confused, destabilized, and unsure who they can turn to,\u201d Feinblatt says.",
      "She sees value in documentaries like \u201cCon Mum,\u201d which show ordinary people being conned.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s this myth that \u2018only gullible people get scammed,\u2019 when in reality, scams are often sophisticated, targeted and deeply emotional. Seeing real people go through these experiences helps normalize the pain of betrayal and shows that it can happen to anyone,\u201d she says.",
      "\u201cAnybody can fall prey to this at the wrong place, at the wrong time. It just has to hit you in your in your vulnerable spot \u2014 and you\u2019re in,\u201d she continues. \u201cA lot of people don\u2019t like to look at it. It\u2019s scary to consider.\u2019"

      "\"Bluey\" has captured the hearts of both parents and children ... and it nabbed the top spot as the most streamed show of 2024.  It was streamed for 55 billion minutes last year. Not bad for 9-minute animated shorts with just three seasons.",
      "In 2024, the end of the show's third season threw viewers into a tailspin \u2014 from the drama and tears of \"The Sign\" episode to the shock of the \"Surprise\" finale. \"Bluey\" minisodes dropped over the summer, a \"Bluey\" movie is in the works, Bluey's World announced its opening in Queensland, Australia and Academy Award-winning actress Natalie Portman called her tiny role on \"Bluey\" her \"most important\" performance credit.",
      "Though the core four Heelers get the vast majority of the screentime, there are a number of other characters who inhabit their world and add charm and warmth to the show.",
      "Here's a full rundown of who's who in the Blueyverse.",
      "Bluey",
      "As the title character, Bluey is a seemingly inexhaustible font of energy. She starts off the series as a 6-year-old and then turns 7 in the \"Pass the Parcel\" episode.",
      "She's generally a caring big sister to Bingo and she loves any game that involves role play. (Her stint as Granny Janet is particularly entertaining.)",
      "Bingo",
      "Bluey's little sister can be a bit shy, but she learns to use her Big Girl voice. She begins the series as a 4-year-old and turns 5 in the second season.",
      "Just like many little sisters, Bingo is a bit more fearful than Bluey and appreciates some extra reassurance from her sister and her parents, especially when life gets \"trifficult.\"",
      "Dad (Bandit)",
      "Bluey's dad Bandit is a lovable clown who is generally in the mood for an imaginative game. Bandit has two older brothers, Rad and Stripe, with whom he tends to be competitive. He works as as an archeologist (and loves to dig up bones).",
      "In typical dad fashion, he loves sports, barbecues and horseplay. But he's also willing to sit and empathize with his daughters, adjusting his behavior to be more sensitive when needed.",
      "Mum (Chilli)",
      "Chilli really breaks down the mom stereotype of always being the patient nurturer. In many episodes, Chilli appears to be short-tempered or frustrated with her kids, and she teaches them that moms sometimes need a time out, just like kids do.",
      "\"I need 20 minutes where no one comes near me,\" Chilli once told her husband as soon as he came home from work.",
      "She also teaches her daughters how to throw a stick, she fixes the broken toilet, she plays field hockey and she works as a \"sniffer\" dog in airport security.",
      "Muffin",
      "Muffin is Bluey and Bingo's younger cousin. Her parents are Aunt Trixie and Uncle Stripe. Having Muffin around gives Bingo the chance to be a big kid.",
      "Muffin has to get loud to get heard, and she's still learning how to take turns. And if she's skipped her nap, watch out!",
      "Aunt Trixie",
      "Aunt Trixie is Muffin\u2019s mom, and she's not afraid to tease the grownups.",
      "She plays games \u2014 and hockey \u2014 with the kids, and she can't resist a freshly opened bag of chips.",
      "Uncle Stripe",
      "Uncle Stripe is married to Aunt Trixie, and he's competitive with his brother Bandit. He is a big \"Stump Fest\" fan.",
      "Aunty Brandy",
      "Voiced by actress Rose Byrne, Aunty Brandy is Chilli's older sister.",
      "The show suggests that Brandy struggled with infertility and had to distance herself from Chilli's family as a result. In \"The Sign,\" however, we see the sisters reunite ... and Brandy is pregnant!",
      "Calypso",
      "Calypso is Bluey's teacher. She is remarkably calm, fair and patient \u2014 and she's very good at knitting.",
      "Chloe",
      "Chloe is one of Bluey's best friends, and she's a total pro at the monkey bars. Her favorite TV show is \"Chutney Chimp.\"",
      "Coco",
      "Coco and Bluey have known each other since they were babies \u2014 their mums used to bring them to the same infant class. Coco is the youngest of nine and her mom helped Chilli learn that babies hit milestones in their own time.",
      "Indy",
      "Indy, one of Bluey's friends, is a free spirit ... with everything except her diet. She cannot eat wheat, gluten, sugar, salt, dairy and many other additives.",
      "Nana",
      "Nana's house rule is that everyone gets what they want ... which mostly works out for the best. She is patient and sensitive to her grandchildren's feelings, and she loves telling jokes.",
      "Grandad",
      "Grandad is Chilli's father. Currently retired, he loves canoeing, bush walking and eating curried sausages. He is reluctant to change his active lifestyle but knows how much Chilli wants him to take care of himself.",
      "Frisky",
      "Frisky is Chilli's friend and Bluey's godmother. She met her husband-to-be, Uncle Rad, while acting as a \"double babysitter\" for Bingo and Bluey. The tension before her wedding is a major plot point of \"The Sign.\"",
      "Uncle Rad",
      "Uncle Rad is Bandit's oldest brother. He used to work on an oil rig far away, and he would delight his nieces on his infrequent visits. But when he married Frisky at the end of Season 3, they decided to set up house in Brisbane, so he'll see them more often now.",
      "Bobo",
      "Bobo is the name of the Heeler family car. It reliably brings the family everywhere they need to go ... but it's a bit cluttered with stickers and drink cups and crayons inside."

    "story": [
      "The Season 2 finale of \"Survival of the Thickest\" delivers an emotional conclusion to a season filled with humor, self-discovery, and, of course, the bold fashion choices that the show is known for.",
      "Michelle Buteau\u2019s character, Mavis Beaumont, ends the season with a moment of personal growth and professional triumph, cementing the show\u2019s commitment to exploring themes of inclusivity, second chances and the importance of chosen family.",
      "In the final episode, Mavis takes a stand against a fashion designer who, despite claiming to be inclusive, fails to truly cater to plus-size women. Her protest against this designer quickly goes viral, leading to a tense and public fallout. The situation escalates when Mavis is invited to a podcast interview, but instead of using the opportunity to clarify her stance, the interview exacerbates the conflict. It leaves Mavis with a tarnished reputation and a career in jeopardy.",
      "But Mavis doesn\u2019t back down. She takes matters into her own hands, collaborating with the designer to create a groundbreaking fashion show. This show not only features plus-size women but also celebrates the inclusion of trans women and individuals of all body types. It\u2019s a defining moment in Mavis\u2019 career, symbolizing her personal commitment to fighting for authentic representation in the fashion industry.",
      "\u201cThis moment in the finale feels like a culmination of everything Mavis has been working for,\u201d Buteau tells TODAY.com. \u201cInclusivity isn\u2019t just about ticking boxes; it\u2019s about creating spaces where everyone can truly see themselves.\u201d",
      "As Mavis works through her professional turmoil, she also grapples with unresolved feelings for her ex, Luca (Marouane Zotti). Their brief reunion in the finale provides a bittersweet moment, filled with uncertainty. Their exchange leaves viewers questioning whether this is the start of something new or simply a nostalgic revisit to the past.",
      "\u201cMavis has come a long way in learning to love herself first,\u201d Buteau says. \u201cNow, the question is \u2014 can she share that love with someone else without losing the growth she\u2019s made?\u201d",
      "Throughout the season, Mavis relies heavily on her chosen family \u2014her friends \u2014 who provide support, wisdom, and humor during some of her most trying times. This concept of chosen family is a central theme of the finale and serves as a reminder that relationships, whether biological or not, can be just as meaningful and life-changing.",
      "As the season closes, fans are left with lingering questions about Mavis\u2019 future. Will her reconciliation with Luca lead to something more? Will her newfound business ventures thrive? And how will her personal life evolve in the wake of her career\u2019s growth?",
      "For now, though, the season finale cements the show's messages of self-love, authenticity and inclusivity. Whether in fashion, friendship, or love, \"Survival of the Thickest\" argues the key to success is staying true to yourself and the people who support you.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re all on our own journeys,\u201d Buteau says. \u201cBut at the end of the day, the love we give to ourselves \u2014 and the people we surround ourselves with \u2014 defines everything.\u201d"

      "In her book, \"Boat Baby,\" publishing April 1, the NBC News chief consumer investigative correspondent details how she arrived in Oregon as an infant, grew up in California and worked her way up at local news outlets across the country before she landed at 30 Rock.",
      "Nguyen, 46, sits in her office wearing an olive-green dress and pink UGG boots \u2014 her signature shoe, which she references in her book (and even sometimes wears on TODAY) \u2014 and tells TODAY.com about why she decided to write a memoir.",
      "\"At the time, I think I was in my early 40s,\" she says of when she was first approached with the idea of writing her own book. \"And I thought, I'm not sure that I have enough to say yet.\"",
      "It wasn't until her TV agent insisted that Nguyen's family story was special that she began to think more seriously about compiling it all in a book.",
      "\"When I look at what my parents sacrificed, and I think about the story of the 2 million boat people who fled Vietnam between 1975 and 1992, it actually is a really important story to document,\" she says.",
      "Nguyen adds that growing up, she never read stories like hers. She says she had heard of other families' stories, but in her community, the experience wasn't often formally talked about or written about.",
      "\"That really solidified my decision that, yes, absolutely, there is a story here that is important to tell, at least as a tribute to my parents and also as a love letter to the United States of America,\" she says.",
      "\"Because I really, truly feel in no other country can someone go from being a boat baby refugee to a network news correspondent at some of the most beloved American institutions, NBC, Nightly News and the TODAY show, right in one generation. Like that just doesn't happen in a lot of different places,\" she continues.",
      "Coming to America",
      "Nguyen's story in the U.S. begins with how she got there: Her mother, Li\u00ean \u0110\u1ed7, worked at a U.S.-based adoption agency in Vietnam, while her father, Huy Nguy\u1ec5n, served in the South Vietnamese army fighting against communism alongside American troops.",
      "After she was born in the summer of 1978, her parents decided to flee Vietnam, landing at a refugee camp on an island off the coast of Malaysia in 1979.",
      "While at the camp on Bidong Island, Nguyen's mother wrote to her employer, Holt International Children's Services, asking if they could sponsor her family.",
      "After spending 10 months at the camp, Nguyen's family got the call that it was time to leave: Two families who worked at Holt had decided to help.",
      "Nguyen, her mother and her father landed in Eugene, Oregon, with an apartment pantry fully stocked with staples, including fish sauce, Nguyen says, wondering how the agency's workers were able to locate the item back in the '80s.",
      "Nguyen says that the experience of moving into a home with some of their favorite items reminds her that communities across the country can come together when people need it most \u2014 even in divisive times.",
      "\"Your friends, your neighbors, the communities that make up so many American towns and cities all across this country are filled with people who share a lot in common \u2014 people who want the same things for their families, and people who are at heart, really kind and generous,\" she says.",
      "Nguyen says the process of writing her own story, and going back and learning more about her parents' lives before she was born, has helped her to see that even through tough times, her family has stuck together through it all.",
      "It's one of the reasons she decided to dedicate the book to her mom and dad, which reads, \"To my mother, Lien, and my father, Huy, for reasons that will be abundantly clear by the end of this book.\"",
      "\"It is a tribute to them, and it is dedicated to them for a reason,\" she says. \"There is no me, none of my success, none of my accomplishments, none of who I am is possible without everything that they did for me, but also how they contributed to shaping who I am.\"",
      "Growing up Vietnamese American",
      "In \"Boat Baby,\" Nguyen documents her family's journey in the U.S. After bouncing between Nevada and a few cities in California, her family ended up in Santa Rosa for most of Nguyen\u2019s childhood, where in high school she would decide she wanted to pursue a career in medicine \u2014 and meet her future husband, Brian.",
      "In college, her dreams shifted from medicine to journalism, and she secured her first job at Central Florida News 13 in Orlando, Florida, after graduating from the University of San Francisco.",
      "And in Orlando, her relationship would be put to the test, as her now-husband was completing medical school in California while she worked on the opposite side of the country.",
      "\"I feel like we went through the long distance, the two very demanding career paths, and we chose each other,\" she says. \"I think that actually having that scaffolding helped each of us do the best that we could in our respective challenging careers, because we had the relationship part figured out. We had the partner.\"",
      "\"Going through all of that, and then really making a conscious decision at the most challenging part of our relationship, living on separate coasts, to stay together and to proceed, that showed us we were rock-solid,\" she adds.",
      "And after stints at news outlets in Reno, Nevada, and Phoenix, Arizona, she returned to the Bay Area to work for NBC\u2019s affiliated station out of San Francisco, before she was tipped off to a potential job opening at NBC News in New York in 2018.",
      "After making it through a brutal amount of interviews, which she describes in her book are nicknamed the \"NBC Wheel of Death,\" Nguyen was convinced she would be offered the job.",
      "But it was her husband who ended up being one of her biggest roadblocks to the gig of a lifetime, she wrote in the book, as he wasn't sure if he wanted to uproot their entire family to move to New York City.",
      "NBC sent her an offer, and after some negotiations, Nguyen accepted and moved her entire family \u2014 her husband, their three daughters, plus her mother and father \u2014 to New York City in 2019.",
      "And on Nguyen's first day with the network, she was greeted by TODAY's Savannah Guthrie and Craig Melvin, as Craig was covering for Hoda Kotb while she was on maternity leave.",
      "\"What a premonition,\" Nguyen says of Craig's eventual rise to the co-anchor chair.",
      "\"Craig\u2019s book about his dad was definitely helpful for me as a guide in writing and thinking about the ways you talk about your parents when they\u2019re still alive and you\u2019re writing about them,\" she says, adding Craig and Savannah have supported her as she prepares to publish her own book.",
      "\"In terms of their warmth and how much they welcomed me and made me feel comfortable from Day 1 to now, almost six years later, you couldn\u2019t ask for better colleagues and role models,\" Nguyen says.",
      "Just as she began to get settled in her new role, the COVID-19 pandemic started in 2020, resulting in Nguyen being one of the only correspondents in Studio 1A. Nguyen also reported on the rise of discrimination against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders at the time.",
      "Nguyen says she was able to recognize that her identity as an Asian American journalist could help her cover certain communities in beneficial ways \u2014 a realization she describes as \"freeing.\"",
      "\"It was nice to be able to give myself permission to bring a little bit more of my own background and perspective into the reporting, because we could all agree that discriminating against people based on their race is wrong, attacking people, abusing people, pushing down elderly people of any race or ethnicity is wrong,\" she says.",
      "Nguyen adds: \"Being able to tell those stories and feel supported, and feel like I wasn\u2019t telling those stories just because I was Asian American \u2014 I was telling them because they needed to be told.\"",
      "25 years of service journalism",
      "As Nguyen shares more about her current position at TODAY and how it has impacted her life so far, a news broadcast plays on mute behind her.",
      "\"I feel like I\u2019m living the dream in terms of healthy parents, healthy kids, and getting to do work that I think is really meaningful and impactful, and serving the public,\" she says. \"I\u2019m so grateful every day that this is what I get to do.\"",
      "\"I always leave space and room open for other ways I can be of service and use all the skills that I have garnered in 25 years as a journalist to tell stories and to bring information that helps people,\" she continues. \"I just feel so lucky that I get to learn every single day to distill that information and then pass it along to the TODAY show audience. It doesn\u2019t get better than that as a journalist.\"",
      "She adds that the release of her book has made her feel not only closer to her own family, but others in her community, as well.",
      "\"I just ultimately hope that when people read the book, they laugh, they see themselves in it, they are reminded that we have so much more in common than we realize, and I hope it brings them some joy,\" she says. \"I think it\u2019s important for people to recognize that we all have interesting stories to tell about how we got to be who we are, and what a big part our families play in all of that, too.\"",
      "\"I hope people feel like they\u2019re having a conversation with me, and they walk away with some useful, practical advice for their own lives, and that they see themselves in our shared experience as Americans,\" she adds.",
      "The reaction to the book so far has been special, she says, both with readers and her own family members.",
      "\u201cI think readers are seeing my mom and dad as I hoped they would: brave, resilient, optimistic. We know family can be messy and we have our ups and downs, but I\u2019m grateful every day because my success is their success,\u201d she says.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re still helping me today to be the best mom, journalist, person I can be,\u201d Nguyen says."

      "Warning: This post contains spoilers for Season 3 of \"The White Lotus.\"",
      "Fans of the \"The White Lotus\" have been waiting to see Gaitok show off his killer instinct in Season 3 of the hit HBO show, and the hotel security guard seems to be getting closer than ever before in Episode 7.",
      "While at a Muay Thai fight with his crush, Mook (Lalisa Manobal, better known by her stage name Lisa), Gaitok confronts the world of violence \u2014 and comes to terms with the fact some of the people at the hotel may not be who they think they are.",
      "As one of the fighters is getting knocked out, Gaitok looks down at Valentin (Arnas Fedaravi\u010dius), one of the wellness gurus at the resort, and sees him cheering with Laurie (Carrie Coon) and two of his Russian friends. Gaitok slowly starts to realize, through flashbacks, that Vlad and Alexei were the two men behind the robbery at the hotel earlier in the season.",
      "Tayme Thapthimthong, who plays Gaitok, tells TODAY.com that the moment of realization for his character is \"very shocking.\"",
      "\"When he goes to the fight, it's obviously very shocking for him to put it together, because the tall Russian guy obviously has very distinct features, and he obviously remembers him from just before he was pistol-whipped,\" Thapthimthong says. \"So just to see that he's like, 'Wait a minute, is it that guy?' And then to see him next to Valentin ... it's just kind of like, 'No, I think this guy's so cool.'\"",
      "\"And then (Valentin) was actually the friend that let them in \u2014 it's all coming together,\" he adds. \"But also, I think in his mind, it's like, Do I tell someone? Like, if I tell someone, what's going to happen to him?'\"",
      "Thapthimthong says he thinks Gaitok knows Valentin's backstory \u2014 he moved to the hotel before the war started in Russia \u2014 and what his involvement in the crime could mean for his employment in Thailand.",
      "\"So I think he's had a lot of empathy for him,\" Thapthimthong says.",
      "Ultimately, Thapthimthong thinks Gaitok is \"just extremely disappointed\" to figure out Valentin could be involved in the crime.",
      "\"Like, I thought you were a friend,\" he says of his character\u2019s thought process. \"We've trained Muay Thai together outside of work. You know, you seem like someone I would befriend for a long time, but I can't believe you would actually let me get hurt like that and be OK with it, and then never say anything.\"",
      "\"Most of all, I think he is processing, like, 'What do I do with this information now?'\" he continues. \"Because he is obviously thinking as well, 'If I do tell someone, maybe they'll like me even more at work, and I'll get a promotion, because I helped solve the case.'\"",
      "The night begins as a date night for Gaitok and Mook, after Valentin gives him tickets for his Muay Thai fight. Before arriving at the fight, Mook and Gaitok grab dinner, where he tells her he doesn't think he is going to be promoted to become a bodyguard.",
      "\"He says I don't have a killer instinct,\" Gaitok tells Mook, referring to his exchange with his boss at the shooting range.",
      "Mook says Gaitok can prove his boss wrong, but Gaitok says that even when the robbers came to the hotel, he didn't want to fight.",
      "He references the Buddha, who condemns violence. Mook says violence is OK in defense. Gaitok replies that he still doesn't want to hurt anyone.",
      "\"You have to be strong, that's part of the job,\" Mook says.",
      "She adds that she also thought Gaitok was more ambitious and that he wanted a better job.",
      "Thapthimthong says he thinks his character was always OK with his job as the hotel's security guard \u2014 and that it was Mook who got into his head.",
      "\"That first episode when, Mook's like, 'Oh yeah, those guys, they get to travel the world, get good pay and have good responsibility, I think that's what hit him,\" he says.",
      "Thapthimthong refers to the scene where Gaitok says he thinks his job is pretty good, and that he does have a big responsibility as one of the hotel's security guards.",
      "\"I think it's when she's like, 'Really? Like, just this letting cars in and out? Is that really that fun?' And I think he's just like, OK, I need to do something. I need to do something more with myself,'\" Thapthimthong says.",
      "At the Muay Thai fight, Mook tells Gaitok, \u201cSee, it\u2019s natural.\u201d She adds that it's \"human to fight.\"",
      "\"There's a lot going through this guy's mind, for sure,\" Thapthimthong says. 'I've really enjoyed the layers that he had to him.\"",
      "During one of Gaitok's flashbacks to the robbery at the resort, he remembers seeing a tall bald man wearing a mask \u2014 with similar features as Vlad \u2014 hitting the car as his fellow robber is about to pistol-whip Gaitok.",
      "He also remembers that he was talking with Valentin at the security checkpoint when the car sped through to commit the robbery.",
      "\"The way I have thought about how Gaitok and Valentin's relationship is in the hotel, is that, Gaitok's a very local guy,\" Thapthimthong says. \"And any foreigner that comes in and befriends him, he's like, so grateful. You know, he's like, 'Oh my God, this guy's talking to me.'\"",
      "Thapthimthong says that was part of his experience serving in the Thai army and cross-training with U.S. forces \u2014 some of his fellow soldiers would get excited when an American soldier talked to them so that they could practice their English.",
      "Similarly, Thapthimthong thinks Thai security guards would be excited to have a foreigner talking with them, especially another worker at the hotel. He references how Gaitok reacts when Valentin offers him a ticket to the Muay Thai fight in Episode 2.",
      "\"I played it as, you know, he obviously looks up to Valentin, as someone who's very cool, and he's got an amazing physique, too,\" Thapthimthong says. \"And he does Muay Thai \u2014 I always thought Gaitok's not a violent guy, but he does, just like most men in Thailand, enjoy watching a Muay Thai fight. So he definitely looks up to Valentin that way.\"",
      "After the fight, Laurie goes home with Aleksei and hooks up with him. He then asks her for money \u2014 upwards of $10,000 \u2014 to help his sick mother back in Russia.",
      "As Laurie is trying to say no, she hears a knock on the door. It's Aleksei's girlfriend is trying to get in. Aleksei tries to stall as Laurie runs into another room, where she discovers the jewelry stolen during the robbery at the hotel.",
      "She ends up jumping out of Aleksei's window and running to catch a cab back to the hotel, while Gaitok ruminates on what to do with his own realization.",
      "As for whether Gaitok is a bad security guard? Thapthimthong says Gaitok is definitely not good at his job, but that he is an accurate representation of a hotel security guard in Thailand.",
      "\"Hotel security guards in Thailand in general, they're not your typical big, chunky guys who you would usually see in front of a club,\" Thapthimthong says. \"I don't think in those hotels they would really expect any like physical confrontation.\"",
      "\"I have seen a lot of guys be like that. They're usually just in charge of opening the gate and ushering the guests in, and are just like a friendly face that you see at the front gate when you first enter,\" he continues. \"So I think that that Gaitok's character was written pretty spot-on.\"",
      "Thapthimthong says he used his experience in the military and working in security to make Gaitok's demeanor convincing.",
      "\"I've always been a smiley guy, but obviously, when I've been a bodyguard, or I'm in some more heated situations when doing security, you know, I have to turn it up,\" he says.",
      "Thapthimthong says each episode has pushed Gaitok to the brink.",
      "\"From episode to episode, I wanted to let Gaitok develop from smiling the whole time and being worry free, because, like, no one's going to ever break into this hotel. I'm never going to have to use a gun. Like, guns never been on my radar,\" he says. \"As each episode goes on, as you've seen, it gets a bit more so stressful for him.\"",
      "He says the ending of the second to last episode perfectly sets up each character for the finale \u2014 though he was sure not to let any secrets slip.",
      "\"By the end of Episode 7, I think every single character has a reason for them to be tied to this,\" he says of the finale."

Harvey as a confident, cunning and savvy New York City attorney became a difficult act to replicate, many thanks actor Gabriel Macht\u2019s portrayal.",
      "So when the \u201cSuits\u201d resurgence in 2023 created enough buzz to lead a spinoff series, \u201cSuits LA,\u201d by the same creator, Aaron Korsh, fans had to know: Could Harvey Specter return?",
      "That answer became a yes, in the form of a brief cameo in the fourth episode. Macht says he never wished for a major role in the new series.",
      "\u201cI thought that we definitely stuck the landing, and I think we gave the fans what they wanted, and we wrapped up some storylines. When you play a character for that long, it\u2019s time to say goodbye,\u201d Macht tells TODAY.com in an interview.",
      "While Macht may not be planning on a longterm role in \u201cSuits LA\u201d as Harvey \u2014 even reluctant to reprise his role until the resurgence, which he shared in a March 24 interview on the 3rd hour of TODAY \u2014 his cameo in a flashback montage, alongside lead actor Stephen Amell\u2019s Ted Black, made a splash.",
      "Amell is the star of \u201cSuits LA,\u201d which focuses on entertainment lawyer Ted in Los Angeles rather than the corporate law firm Harvey headed in the nine seasons of the original series.",
      "The episode that includes Harvey features a flashback of Ted, troubled by a personal issue preventing him from focusing on his latest case. It\u2019s unclear where in Harvey\u2019s professional timeline it takes place, though we know Harvey and Ted both used to work in a district attorney\u2019s office. In the scene, Harvey buys Ted a drink after a baseball game to get his mind off things.",
      "\u201cI think the two of them relied on each other for their cerebral machinations of how to get their cases through,\u201d Macht tells TODAY.com. \u201cI think Harvey was there to show him, \u2018All right now, this is the time to just get the job done.\u2019\u201d",
      "Macht also says he\u2019s a fan of Korsh\u2019s direction in the newest chapter of the \u201cSuits\u201d universe and encourages fans to buy in as well.",
      "\u201cI think it takes time to get legs. I think it takes time for people to sort of accept that this is not the original show; it\u2019s a different show,\u201d he explains.",
      "Macht uses his 134-episode run with \u201cSuits\u201d as an example of the time required to build loyalty and storylines.",
      "\u201cWhen I first started, my cousin said to me, \u2018So the hook of your show is a fake lawyer and a real lawyer. How\u2019s that going to last more than a couple episodes?\u2019\u201d Macht recalls, \u201cI said, \u2018You never know.\u2019 And then it ended up 134 episodes.\u201d",
      "Macht previously said on Instagram that Harvey and Ted\u2019s friendship will be unpacked in three episodes of \u201cSuits LA.\u201d Rick Hoffman also revealed he will reprise his role as Specter\u2019s infamous rival Louis Litt in an upcoming episode.",
      "\u201cIt takes a while for people to feel like you can bring someone in your home,\u201d Macht explains. \u201cWith a little bit of the original coming in and spicing it up and just giving you a little bit of a spark \u2014 I think it\u2019s helpful. But these guys, they don\u2019t even need us.\u201d",
      "In the meantime, Macht is enjoying his time away from major acting roles, mostly focusing on his private life. He especially loves not having to memorize 10 pages of dialogue every day \u2014 and being a soccer dad. (He has two teenaged kids with wife Jacinda Barrett.)",
      "\u201cI\u00a0don\u2019t have a minivan, but I\u2019m doing the school runs, and I\u2019m waking the kids up, and I\u2019m just seeing them grow, and I\u2019m seeing the challenges of adolescents,\u201d Macht continues. \u201cI like just being around.\u201d"

Told through candid interviews, the documentary touches on the harsh realities of casting, authentic stories and what some of the industry's biggest names hope for the future.",
      "Directed by Reginald Hudlin, Part One spotlights Black male actors, including Jamie Foxx, Kevin Hart, Don Cheadle, Idris Elba and more. Part Two turns to the stories of leading Black women and features conversations with Angela Bassett, Viola Davis and the star Lynch says she \"had to have\" \u2014\u00a0Whoopi Goldberg.",

      "As for how the project landed all that star power, Lynch jokes, \"It was not me, I can tell you that.\"",
      "Lynch says one interview she specifically \"kept pushing\" for was Goldberg. Originally, the goal was to conduct all the interviews in a span of two weeks. (\"I know ... what were we even thinking?\" Lynch says with a laugh.) She also acknowledges that participating in the project was no small ask.",
      "\"We're asking them each to sit down for an interview, to share part of themselves. And it's not a paying gig. Documentaries are not lucrative, and it's not their production company. And so the business on that was difficult,\" she says. \"But they understood the power of telling the story in this context.\"",
      "She credits the film's executive producers \u2014 which includes Bassett, Berry, Davis and Goldberg \u2014\u00a0with giving participants a sense of \"comfort.\"",
      "Part of the documentary explores the importance for actresses to not only be No. 1 on a project but also lead behind the scenes as a producer or director. Having some of those very women be executive producers of \"Number One on the Call Sheet\" \"sends the right signal to all the other people we're trying to bring into the project,\" Lynch says.",
      "\"Filmmaking is a team event,\" Lynch says. \"You can't just have one star. You need everybody to be functioning at a high level. And everybody who worked on this film is kind of No. 1 on the call sheet in their arena.\"",
      "An 'enormous orchestra'",
      "Each interview ranged in length from 45 minutes to up to two hours, Lynch says. Her job was to distill the interviews into a comprehensive narrative, and more importantly, make it feel like each actor was in a dialogue with the other.",
      "\"What I wanted to do is have them be in conversation with each other, even though it never would have happened, like the scheduling could have never happened,\" she says. \"So having Whoopi, as the person who's been doing it the longest, all the way to Meagan and Jurnee and a nod to all of the wonderful young actresses coming up ... I thought that was really important.\"",

After all, the heart of the project comes from the interviews, which Lynch says reminded her that celebrities aren't untouchable, but just people.",
      "\"I got to have a conversation with Halle Berry, the person. Angela Bassett, the person. Cynthia Erivo, the person,\" she says. \"There is delight and pleasure in that, and I hope that comes through in the film.\"",
      "She anticipated the experience to be interesting \u2014 a story to tell her teenagers, recapping who all she got to meet and interview. But what she didn't expect was for it to be inspiring and ultimately, relatable, she says.",
      "\"Because whether you're a school teacher or a documentary filmmaker or a journalist, we should each want to be No. 1 on the call sheet,\" she says. \"And we should be working toward that in our purpose to be excellent.\"",
      "That focus on excellence, Lynch says, is why she decided not to change the project's title.",
      "\u201cIt signifies greatness. If we can have everybody in the world talking about being No. 1 on their call sheet, how amazing would that be?\u201d",

      "Over the years, he has been subject to additional criticism, including having his recording contract temporarily suspended in February 2021 after he was caught on camera using a racial slur. However, the following year, he reappeared at award shows and won album of the year at the Academy of Country Music Awards in May 2022.",
      "In December 2024, Wallen pleaded guilty to two misdemeanor counts of reckless endangerment following his April arrest after he threw a chair off of a bar\u2019s rooftop. He was sentenced to seven days incarceration at a DUI education center and two years\u2019 probation.",

    "summary": "Marine Le Pen, the leader of France's far-right party, was handed a four-year prison sentence and banned from holding public office for five years by a court.",
    "story": [
      "Far-right French leader Marine Le Pen was handed a four-year prison sentence and banned from holding public office for five years by a French court Monday, in what could be the biggest setback for her political cause in a generation.",
      "Until this week, Le Pen had looked like the likeliest winner in France's next presidential election set for 2027, but she was found guilty Monday by a court of embezzling European Union funds.",
      "When handing down the sentence, the court said the crimes committed by Le Pen, 56, warranted an immediate ban from public office, Reuters reported. The court also handed her a fine of 100,000 euros ($108,195).",
      "Le Pen\u2019s lawyer said she would appeal the verdict, but she will remain ineligible while she does and could therefore be ruled out of the 2027 presidential race. She was also sentenced to four years\u2019 imprisonment, with two to be served under house arrest and two suspended.",
      "Speaking to French TV channel TF1, Le Pen said that a ruling barring her from seeking public office is \"political\" and that it aims to keep her out of the race for France's top job. She added that millions of people were \u201coutraged\u201d about the verdict and that the ruling was a violation of the rule of law.",
      "Even if she does appeal the ban on public office, only an appellate ruling could overturn it and restore her hopes of running, although time is running out for that to happen before the election as appeals in\u00a0France\u00a0can take several years to conclude. There is also no guarantee that an appeals court would rule more favorably.",
      "The nine-week trial, which began in November after almost a decade of investigations, saw Le Pen and 24 other figures from her National Rally (RN) party accused of misusing more than 3 million euros ($3.3 million) of European Parliament funds to pay party staff between 2004 and 2016 in violation of E.U. regulations. All of those accused have denied the charges.",
      "Delivering his ruling Monday, Judge Benedicte de Perthuis said Le\u00a0Pen\u00a0had been \u201cat the heart\u201d of the scheme. \u201cIt was established that all these people were actually working for the party, that their (EU) lawmaker had not given them any tasks,\u201d he added, according to Reuters.",
      "He said that the investigations also showed that \u201cthese were not administrative errors ... but embezzlement within the framework of a system put in place to reduce the party\u2019s costs.\u201d",
      "Shortly after being convicted, Le Pen was seen abruptly leaving the Paris courtroom before her sentence was announced.",
      "The ruling has the potential to reshape French politics, with Le Pen having spent decades turning her far-right vehicle into a mainstream and popular political force and herself into the favorite to win the country's next presidential elections, set to be fought in 2027.",
      "After taking over the leadership from her late father, Jean-Marie Le Pen, she has transformed the RN, with its far-right nationalist roots, into the biggest single party in France\u2019s parliament by making it more mainstream and popularizing it among younger and more blue-collar voters.",
      "RN party president 29-year-old Jordan Bardella, who is expected to take Le Pen\u2019s place if his mentor is forced to step down, said Monday that she had been \u201cunjustly condemned,\u201d adding that French democracy had been \u201cexecuted,\u201d Reuters said.",
      "While RN won the largest number of votes in the first round of last year's parliamentary elections, it failed to win a majority and remains outside of France's governing coalition. Emmanuel Macron, the country's centrist president, has since attempted to steer his country through months of razor-thin majorities, no-confidence votes and political uncertainty.",
      "Macron has experienced a mild recovery in the polls during that time \u2014 partly due to the ripple effect of President Donald Trump's first months back in office \u2014 but he cannot run for the presidency a third time due to term limits and any of his centrist successors risk losing to their ultraconservative rival.",
      "A recent poll conducted by the French Institute of Public Opinion for the French broadcaster Sud Radio found that Le Pen would, with around 42% of the vote, easily win the first round of the next presidential election.",
      "Even if she appeals the verdict, a \"provisional execution\" could see Le Pen, a three-time presidential contender and front-runner in the polls ahead of the 2027 vote, barred from running in the election.",
      "Under the ban, Le Pen will not be removed from her seat in parliament until the end of her current term. She can also seek a last-minute reprieve from the French Constitutional Council, which is expected to hand a separate decision Friday on whether immediately barring elected officials from running for office is legal.",
      "RN has accused prosecutors of seeking Le Pen\u2019s \u201cpolitical death\u201d to keep the popular far-right leader from seeking public office.",
      "Le Pen said Saturday that she expected leniency from the judges, telling the French newspaper La Tribune Dimanche that \u201cwith provisional execution, the judges have the power of life or death over our movement ... but I don\u2019t think they\u2019ll go that far.\u201d",
      "The trial has also whipped up fierce debate within France around on the subject of how much judges should be allowed to intervene in the country's politics.",
      "Across Europe, too, far-right leaders said the ruling showed democratic backsliding.",
      "Hungary\u2019s Viktor Orb\u00e1n posted on X saying \u201cI am Marine!\u201d Meanwhile, Deputy Italian Prime Minister Matteo Salvini described the ruling as a declaration of war by Brussels and called Le Pen his friend.",

The orders came during\u00a0Eid al-Fitr, a normally festive Muslim holiday\u00a0marking the end of the fasting month of Ramadan.",
      "The order came after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu repeated a demand on Sunday for Hamas to disarm and for its leaders to leave Gaza as he promised to\u00a0step up pressure\u00a0on the group\u00a0while continuing\u00a0efforts\u00a0to\u00a0return\u00a0hostages.",

      "On Sunday, the first day of the Muslim Eid al-Fitr holiday, health authorities in Gaza said at least 24 people, including several children, had been killed in Israeli strikes. Nine were killed in a single tent in the southern city of Khan\u00a0Younis, they said.",
      "Later on Sunday, the Palestinian Red Crescent Service said it had finally been able to get access to search for rescue teams that had come under Israeli fire during a rescue mission in western\u00a0Rafah, a week after the attack.",
      "It said it had recovered 13 bodies from the scene, seven of them were Palestinian Red Crescent members, another five were from the Gaza Civil Emergency Service, and another was a United Nations worker. There was no immediate Israeli comment.",
      "Since Israel resumed its attacks in Gaza on March 18, hundreds of Palestinians have been killed and tens of thousands have been forced to evacuate areas in northern Gaza where they had returned following the ceasefire agreement in January.",
      "Netanyahu said Israel was demanding that Hamas lay down its arms and said its leaders would be allowed to leave Gaza. He gave no detail on how long Israeli troops would remain in the enclave but repeated that Hamas\u2019s\u00a0military and government capacities must be crushed.",
      "\u201cWe will ensure general security in the Gaza Strip and enable the implementation of the Trump plan, the voluntary emigration plan,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is the plan, we do not hide it, we are ready to discuss it at any time.\u201d",
      "Trump originally proposed moving the entire 2.3 million population of Gaza to countries including Egypt and Jordan and developing the Gaza Strip as a U.S.-owned\u00a0resort. However, no country has agreed to take in the population and Israel has since said that any departures by Palestinians would be voluntary.",
      "Israel launched its campaign in Gaza after a devastating Hamas attack on Israeli communities around the Gaza Strip on Oct. 7, 2023, that killed 1,200 people, according to an Israeli tally, and saw 251 abducted as hostages.",
      "The Israeli campaign has killed more than 50,000 Palestinians, according to Palestinian health authorities, and devastated much of the coastal enclave,\u00a0leaving hundreds of thousands of people in tents and makeshift shelters.",

      "Israel blamed Hamas for the attack, citing the group\u2019s\u00a0refusal to meet Israel\u2019s demand\u00a0to release more hostages in return for the resumption of talks.",
      "But that was not part of that original ceasefire agreement, which included a first phase, where Hamas released 25 living hostages and the bodies of eight in exchange for around 1,800 Palestinian prisoners and detainees by March 1. The second phase was meant to begin 16 days later and would have included the exchange of all the remaining hostages and the establishment of a permanent ceasefire.",
      "The second phase never came. Netanyahu accepted a plan by Steve Witkoff, President Donald Trump\u2019s special envoy to the Middle East, to extend the ceasefire for 50 days to discuss Phase 2, which Hamas rejected.",

      "No food or supplies have entered Gaza in over three weeks in the longest stretch yet without aid entering the enclave, the United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees said Friday, as Israel intensifies its military operations amid the crushing near-complete blockade, plunging the Gaza Strip into deeper desperation.",
      "\u201cCritical supplies, including food and medical equipment, are severely depleted and urgently needed to address the already catastrophic humanitarian crisis,\u201d said an UNRWA report published Friday.",
      "The World Food Programme said in an operational update Thursday that it only had enough food stocks to last another two weeks, \u201cif supplies are stretched.\u201d",
      "\u201cHundreds of thousands of people in Gaza are again at risk of severe hunger and malnutrition as humanitarian food stocks in the Strip dwindle and borders remain closed to aid,\u201d the WFP said.",
      "The UNRWA report noted that on March 18, after Israel broke its ceasefire with Hamas with intense airstrikes, over 180 children were killed in single day, which UNICEF called \u201cone of the largest single-day child death tolls in the last year.\u201d",
      "The\u00a0death toll since the current conflict began on Oct. 7, 2023, has since surpassed 50,000, according to health authorities.",

      "Muhammed Ihsanullah was overjoyed when he received a $3,000 scholarship to spend the summer working at a camp in Minnesota.",
      "But after several travelers from Western nations were detained or deported as part of the Trump administration's crackdown on illegal immigration, the 20-year-old British citizen from Leicester, England, is planning on carrying a burner phone when he comes to the U.S. in May. That\u2019s if he ends up going at all.",
      "\u201cI have a very, you know, stereotypical name as well,\u201d Ihsanullah told NBC News.",
      "He might swap out devices, he said, \u201cjust so that I have the added security of knowing that no one\u2019s going to go through my phone.\u201d",
      "Potential U.S. visitors such as Ihsanullah are expressing growing uncertainty about their travel plans amid the crackdown and warnings from U.S. embassies in more than a dozen countries, like the one in Sweden that said anyone entering the U.S. on a visa is a \u201cguest\u201d and if you lie about your intended behavior while in the country, \"You\u2019re out.\u201d",
      "Earlier this month, a Lebanese doctor working at Brown University's medical center was sent home despite having a valid U.S. visa after U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents searching her phone found photos and videos they said were \u201csympathetic\u201d to the former leader of the Hezbollah militant group, whose funeral she told agents she attended last month.",
      "Such searches pre-date the new Trump administration, and Customs and Border Protection says it conducts them to detect \u201cdigital contraband, terrorism-related content, and information relevant to visitor admissibility.\u201d",
      "\u201cClaims that CBP is searching more electronic media due to administration change are false,\u201d CBP Assistant Commissioner Hilton Beckham told NBC News in an emailed statement.",
      "\u201cAllegations that political beliefs trigger inspections or removals are baseless and irresponsible,\u201d he added.",
      "Such searches are not new to travelers from parts of the world who already face stringent visa requirements \u2014 Chinese students arriving in the U.S., for example, have complained in recent years of being increasingly subject to interrogation and detention on national security grounds.",
      "But many of the cases in recent weeks have involved travelers from countries such as France, Germany and Canada \u2014 longtime allies with which the U.S. shares intelligence, has frequent cultural exchanges and does hundreds of billions of dollars in trade. Several of those held have spoken out about being scrutinized and sometimes locked up for days at the border.",
      "Last week, France\u2019s interior minister said a French researcher had been turned away by U.S. border agents after they found messages on his phone criticizing the Trump administration. The CBP said searches of the researcher's electronic media devices \u2014 they have not been named by the French authorities \u2014 led to the \u201cdiscovery of proprietary information\u201d from a U.S. laboratory.",
      "CBP does not need a warrant to search the phones of any travelers arriving at the U.S. border, including airports, said Saira Hussain, a senior staff attorney at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a nonprofit digital rights group based in San Francisco.",
      "\u201cThe U.S. government has taken the view that they have the ability to search your devices without a warrant and without suspicion under what\u2019s known as the border search exception to the Fourth Amendment,\u201d she said.",
      "Other travelers have found themselves unexpectedly detained.",
      "Jasmine Mooney, a Canadian woman who was reapplying for a U.S. work visa, was detained without explanation on March 3 at the Mexican border near San Diego and spent 12 days in detention before returning home. She wrote in The Guardian that she was  detained after she was questioned about the status of her visa, which had been granted following an initial rejection.",
      "\u201cThere is no communication, you don\u2019t have an officer to talk to,\u201d Mooney told MSNBC last week. \u201cYou can\u2019t contact your lawyers or your friends or your family.\u201d",
      "When Rebecca Burke, a backpacker from Britain, tried to enter from Canada in February, she spent nearly three weeks at a detention center.\u00a0In a statement to the BBC, the Northwest ICE Processing Center said Burke was repatriated after being detained \u201crelated to the violation of the terms and conditions of her admission.\u201d",
      "Burke's family said it believes her detention was due to a misunderstanding about her accommodation arrangements, which were free in exchange for helping hosts with household chores and which her father says authorities may have suspected constituted employment in violation of her visa.",
      "And U.S. citizen Lennon Tyler said she was chained to a bench by border agents last month when her German fianc\u00e9, Lucas Sielaff, was accused of violating the rules of his 90-day U.S. tourist permit while trying to enter from Mexico. Sielaff was detained for two weeks before returning to Germany, according to The Associated Press.",
      "Such incidents have prompted some governments to issue warnings for their citizens traveling to the U.S. The updated British travel advisory reads \u201cyou may be liable to arrest or detention if you break the rules.\u201d",
      "Those warnings have potential visitors to the U.S., like Pat Bastow, a Canadian citizen who plans to rent a car to visit Montana in July for a three-week holiday, seeking advice on how to protect themselves.",
      "\u201cA lot of travel agents are warning people not to go just in case Trump deports,\u201d Bastow, a retired cattle farmer, told NBC News.",
      "Hussain, the lawyer, said she is \u201cencouraging people to think about uploading some of their data to the cloud and downloading it once you\u2019re through screening.\u201d",
      "Turning phones off before arrival is also helpful, she said, as doing so disables facial recognition until a passcode is entered.",
      "Travelers\u2019 rights vary depending on their status \u2014 whether they are U.S. citizens, legal permanent residents or foreign visa holders \u2014 and their port of entry. Almost a quarter of the nearly 47,000 searches of electronic devices conducted at U.S. borders in the last financial year were of U.S. citizens, according to CBP data.",
      "Hussain advised legal permanent residents, or green card holders, \u201cwho may have a bit of a complicated situation\u201d to consult an attorney before traveling.",
      "Visa holders who refuse a search of their devices could see their visas revoked and be barred from entering the U.S., she added.",
      "Rules can vary across the country because the courts have largely avoided ruling on electronic device searches. Last year, a federal judge in New York barred CBP from warrantless searches of people\u2019s phones, but that applies only to John F. Kennedy International Airport.",
      "That lack of consistency, Hussain said, is \u201creally why we believe that the Supreme Court needs to weigh in on this issue.\u201d"

    "summary": "Donald Trump has been giving leaders such as Mark Carney, Mexican Claudia Sheinbaum, Emmanuel Macron and Keir Starmer a popularity boost, experts say.",
    "story": [
      "LONDON \u2014 The second Trump administration may have ruffled the feathers of America\u2019s allies, but there is also evidence it has boosted world leaders scrambling to deal with the White House\u2019s norm-busting approach.",
      "Some have gained plaudits for meeting Trump head-on, while others have taken a more nuanced line between flattering the president and trying to shore up their own interests against the headwinds blowing from Washington.",
      "Canada\u2019s Mark Carney is poised to win next month\u2019s election by volubly rejecting President Donald Trump\u2019s hostile advances to make his country the 51st state. On the flip side, Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum has earned accolades for becoming something of a Trump whisperer, deftly responding to his tariff threats and seeing her own popularity rise accordingly.",
      "In Europe, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer and French President Emmanuel Macron have received polling boosts following their widely praised Trump strategies. And the embattled Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has seen his numbers rise as he has tried to cope with Washington\u2019s brusque approach.",
      "\u201cThe standing of politicians who are having to deal with the crisis engendered by Trump\u2019s presidency is leading to a rise in their popularity, if they seem to be doing this in a reasoned and proper way,\u201d said Dominic Grieve, the former British attorney general and an ex-senior lawmaker for the Conservative Party.",
      "To be clear, Trump is no panacea for leaders. Macron and Starmer are still relatively unpopular and face harsh criticisms on domestic issues that will likely decide future elections. Likewise, good polling numbers will be of limited cheer for Zelenskyy while the future of his entire country is in doubt.",
      "Other analysts debate the extent to which this popularity boost is solely because of Trump, rather than the general climate of global instability and uncertainty of which Washington is a part.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not sure so how much it\u2019s a Trump bounce or more of a international crisis bounce,\u201d said Anand Menon, director of the think tank U.K. in a Changing Europe. \u201cInsecurity means that, initially at least, trust in the government goes up.\u201d",
      "Still, the abrupt change of tone and policy from the White House is an undeniable factor.",
      "Trump\u2019s attacks on Canada have seen a remarkable turnaround for Carney\u2019s Liberals. They were headed for historic losses, but Trump\u2019s onslaught has seen them ride a wave of renewed Canadian nationalism and lead the polls at 45% ahead of April 28\u2019s election.",
      "\u201cThe old relationship we had with the United States,\u201d Carney told a news conference Thursday, \u201cis over.\u201d",
      "Mexico\u2019s Sheinbaum has chosen a different tack, taking action on immigration and fentanyl trafficking \u2014 including sending 10,000 National Guard troops to the border. That earned a delay on Trump\u2019s tariffs, as well as praise from the U.S. president, who called her \u201ca wonderful woman.\u201d",
      "At home, she has mixed this strategy with a cerebral nationalism, telling voters that this is about \u201ccoordination, yes \u2014 submission, never.\u201d",
      "Her already high ratings have risen to 85%, according to the El Financiero newspaper in February.",
      "In the United Kingdom, Starmer\u2019s ratings have gone up 8.5 percentage points from February, according to the British pollster Ipsos. That followed an Oval Office meeting with Trump in which he mixed compliments with candor: talking up a potential trade deal while refusing to budge from a commitment to Ukraine.",
      "He has promised to hike British defense spending to 2.5% of GDP by 2027, part of the wider nervousness in Europe about Trump\u2019s commitment to the trans-Atlantic alliance.",
      "The economy and health care will likely decide the next election. But defense is now the third most important issue for British voters, most polls show. And it is defense and international trade on which voters think Starmer is performing best, according to the Ipsos poll taken between March 14 and 17.",
      "\u201cPretty much all of his readings have become somewhat less unpopular in the wake of his trip to Washington,\u201d said John Curtice, one of Britain\u2019s most respected polling experts and a professor at Scotland\u2019s University of Strathclyde. \u201cI think it\u2019s fair to say the public have noticed that he\u2019s risen to the challenge.\u201d",
      "Another man banging the drum on European defense is France\u2019s Macron. He and Starmer are leading an informal \u201ccoalition of the willing\u201d \u2014 a group of countries prepared to send troops to Ukraine to uphold any eventual ceasefire.",
      "Likewise, the current international upheaval has seen Macron\u2019s popularity jump to 31% in March, up 7 points from the previous month, according to an Ifop poll.",
      "These numbers are still relatively low, however, and they may well be fleeting. Macron can\u2019t run again in the next election, in 2027, but his centrist heirs risk losing the presidency to the far-right National Rally, the current favorite.",
      "The same is true for Starmer, whose Labour Party has slid from a landslide victory last year to near parity with the Conservatives and hard-right Reform U.K. Most voters are worried about high prices for food, energy and housing, rather than their leader\u2019s Oval Office repartee.",
      "For any leader enjoying a momentary upside, Menon, of U.K. in a Changing Europe, has a word of warning: \u201cI wouldn\u2019t get complacent on the back of the fact that, right at the moment, things are looking a little bit better because Trump uncertainty.\u201d"

Renewed fighting shattered a ceasefire deal after two months of relative calm.",
      "Why now?",
      "It was not immediately clear who organized the protests or how many joined them with the intention of rallying against Hamas.",

      "More than 50,000 people, including thousands of children, have been killed in Israel\u2019s offensive in Gaza, according to the local Health Ministry in the enclave, which has been run by Hamas since 2007 after Israel ended its 38-year occupation.",

      "Rescue teams from India, Malaysia, Russia, Thailand and other countries have already arrived in Myanmar, where the military-led government says the death toll from a 7.7-magnitude earthquake Friday has surpassed 1,700, a figure that is expected to rise.",
      "But a U.S. team has yet to appear at the scene of the quake in the Southeast Asian nation, which occurred the same day the State Department informed thousands of employees of the U.S. Agency for International Development, which administers civilian foreign aid, that nearly all of their roles were being eliminated.",
      "Critics have warned that President Donald Trump\u2019s cuts to U.S. foreign aid, which had previously accounted for less than 1% of the annual federal budget, could create an opening for authoritarian governments such as China and Russia that are trying to increase their global influence.",
      "The U.S. Embassy in Myanmar, one of the world\u2019s poorest countries, said Sunday in a post on X that the U.S. would provide up to $2 million in aid through Myanmar-based humanitarian assistance organizations.",
      "The embassy also said that a USAID emergency response team was \u201cdeploying to Myanmar to identify the people\u2019s most pressing needs, including emergency shelter, food, medical needs, and access to water.\u201d",
      "It was not immediately clear when the U.S. team would arrive in Myanmar, even as the country Monday marked the end of the crucial 72 hours since the quake after which the survival rate of people trapped in the rubble sharply decreases.",

We\u2019ve been able to mobilize some internal resources, and we\u2019re confident that other sort of partners will step up.\u201d",
      "China has announced $14 million in assistance for Myanmar, including 1,200 tents, 8,000 blankets and 40,000 first aid kits.

      "\u201cWhat I see is right track, wrong track. And the right track was the first time in like 40 years where it was right track,\u201d the president said, at one point putting Alexander Stubb, the president of Finland, on the phone as well. The two men were golfing in Florida on Saturday.",

      "Asked what his recent message was to motor industry CEOs, and whether he had warned them against raising prices, Trump said, \u201cThe message is congratulations, if you make your car in the United States, you\u2019re going to make a lot of money. If you don\u2019t, you\u2019re going to have to probably come to the United States, because if you make your car in the United States, there is no tariff.\u201d",
      "When pressed if he told CEOs not to raise prices, as reported in the The Wall Street Journal, Trump added, \u201cNo, I never said that. I couldn\u2019t care less if they raise prices, because people are going to start buying American-made cars.\u201d",
      "Trump continued, \u201cI couldn\u2019t care less. I hope they raise their prices, because if they do, people are gonna buy American-made cars. We have plenty.\u201d",
      "Asked if he was concerned about car prices going up, Trump said, \u201cNo, I couldn\u2019t care less, because if the prices on foreign cars go up, they\u2019re going to buy American cars.\u201d",
      "After the interview, an aide followed up with NBC News to say Trump was referring specifically to foreign car prices.",
      "NBC News reported this week that foreign auto parts would also be taxed at 25% even if the vehicles they go into are assembled domestically. Companies that import vehicles under the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) will get special consideration until the government establishes a process for levying the 25% duties, according to the\u00a0White House.",

      "Trump\u2019s tariff announcement on Wednesday came just weeks before his planned April 2 \u201cLiberation Day,\u201d when tariffs on a variety of consumer goods are set to take effect. They drew swift condemnation from international leaders like Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba and Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney.",
      "In remarks on Thursday, Carney told reporters the tariffs were \u201cunjustified\u201d and that \u201cthe old relationship we had with the United States based on deepening integration of our economies and tight security and military cooperation is over.\u201d",
      "Trump on Saturday maintained that he does not plan to further delay the imposition of the April 2 tariffs, and he would consider negotiating on that point \u201conly if people are willing to give us something of great value. Because countries have things of great value, otherwise, there\u2019s no room for negotiation.\u201d",
      "Signal incident",
      "Trump said he has no plans to fire anyone following news that national security adviser Michael Waltz added a journalist to a Signal app group chat with senior members of the Trump administration who were discussing plans to strike Houthi militants in Yemen earlier this month.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t fire people because of fake news and because of witch hunts,\u201d Trump said, calling the story \u201cfake news\u201d throughout the interview.",
      "\u201cI do,\u201d the president said when asked whether he still has confidence in Waltz and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, who was also in the Signal chat and sent a detailed timeline of the planned strikes before they happened.",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s just a witch hunt and the fake news, like you, talk about it all the time, but it\u2019s just a witch hunt, and it shouldn\u2019t be talked [about],\u201d Trump added. \u201cWe had a tremendously successful strike. We struck very hard and very lethal. And nobody wants to talk about that. All they want to talk about is nonsense. It\u2019s fake news.\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s comments come as he has faced calls \u2014 including from his allies \u2014 to fire Waltz after The Atlantic\u2019s editor-in-chief Jeffrey Goldberg wrote on Monday that he had been added to a chat group on a private messaging app with senior administration officials.",
      "In the chat, the officials appeared to discuss their plans to strike Houthi rebels, which the Trump administration has since repeatedly claimed were not classified.",
      "\u201cI have no idea what Signal is. I don\u2019t care what Signal is,\u201d Trump said on Saturday. \u201cAll I can tell you is it\u2019s just a witch hunt, and it\u2019s the only thing the press wants to talk about, because you have nothing else to talk about. Because it\u2019s been the greatest 100-day presidency in the history of our country.\u201d",
      "Everything is on the table to obtain Greenland",

      "Greenland Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen pushed back against Trump's plan to annex the nation, writing Sunday on Facebook: \"President Trump says the United States is 'getting Greenland.' Let me make this clear: The U.S. is not getting that. We don\u2019t belong to anyone else. We decide our own future.\"",
      "\"We must not act out of fear. We must respond with peace, dignity and unity. And it is through these values that we must clearly, clearly and calmly show the American president that Greenland is ours. It was like that yesterday. That\u2019s how it is today. And that\u2019s how it will be in the future,\" he added.",
      "Asked what message acquiring Greenland would send to Russia and the rest of the world, Trump said, \u201cI don\u2019t really think about that. I don\u2019t really care. Greenland\u2019s a very separate subject, very different. It\u2019s international peace. It\u2019s international security and strength.\u201d",
      "\u201cYou have ships sailing outside Greenland from Russia, from China and from many other places. And we\u2019re not going to allow things to happen that are going to be \u2014 that are going to hurt the world or the United States,\u201d he added.",
      "CLARIFICATION: This article was updated to reflect that after the interview, an aide followed up with NBC News to say Trump was referring to foreign car prices."

      "The city in a short statement didn\u2019t give a date for the wedding. Italian media have reported it will be between June 24-26, with a few days of celebrations.",
      "\u201cThe many speculations and fake news circulating about Jeff Bezos\u2019 wedding are completely unfounded,\u201d the statement said.",
      "Bezos is the owner of The Washington Post and founder and largest individual shareholder of Amazon. Among others, George and Amal Clooney celebrated their wedding in Venice in 2014.",
      "The city said only 200 guests would be invited, a number easily accommodated without any disruption to the city, its residents and visitors. It noted that it has broad experience handling international events \u201cmuch larger than this.\u201d",

      "The city denied those reports, saying it \u201cis their utmost priority to make sure the city functions as normal, for all, with no abnormal disruption to anyone.\u201d",

      "WASHINGTON \u2014 President Donald Trump said he was \u201cvery angry\u201d and \u201cpissed off\u201d when Russian President Vladimir Putin criticized the credibility of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy\u2019s leadership, adding that the comments were \u201cnot going in the right location.\u201d",
      "Agence France-Presse reported that Putin on Friday called for a transitional government to be put in place in Ukraine, which could effectively push out Zelenskyy.",
      "\u201cIf Russia and I are unable to make a deal on stopping the bloodshed in Ukraine, and if I think it was Russia\u2019s fault \u2014 which it might not be \u2014 but if I think it was Russia\u2019s fault, I am going to put secondary tariffs on oil, on all oil coming out of Russia,\u201d Trump said in an early-morning phone call with NBC News on Sunday.",
      "\u201cThat would be that if you buy oil from Russia, you can\u2019t do business in the United States,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThere will be a 25% tariff on all oil, a 25- to 50-point tariff on all oil.\u201d",
      "Trump had criticized Zelenskyy, saying he was \u201csick\u201d of his handling of the war and falsely calling him a dictator.",
      "President Joe Biden banned Russian oil imports shortly after Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022. Since then, the amount of Russian oil imported to the United States has plummeted, to only 10,000 barrels of Russian crude oil and petroleum products in 2023, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.",
      "Trump similarly announced \"secondary tariffs\" on Venezuela, saying on Truth Social that the tariffs would be placed on countries that bought oil and gas from Venezuela.",
      "A few of the top importers of Russian oil products include China, Turkey, Brazil and India, according to an analysis by the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air. If Trump uses the same definition of secondary tariffs he used with Venezuela, they could be among the countries seeing impacts of secondary tariffs.",
      "Trump had made ending the war in Ukraine a top foreign policy promise on the campaign trail, leading to meetings among U.S., Ukrainian and Russian officials in the first few months of his second term. Last week, Russia and Ukraine agreed on a partial and limited ceasefire that would allow safe navigation in the Black Sea and halt attacks on each other\u2019s energy facilities.",
      "\u201cThere will be a 25% tariff on oil and other products sold in the United States, secondary tariffs,\u201d Trump said, saying the tariffs on Russia would come within a month without a ceasefire deal. Trump said Putin knows he is angry but said he has \u201ca very good relationship with him\u201d and \u201cthe anger dissipates quickly ... if he does the right thing.\u201d",
      "The two men plan to speak again this week, Trump said.",
      "He made the comments after a separate phone interview with NBC News on Saturday evening, when he threatened \u201cbombing\u201d and \u201csecondary tariffs\u201d on Iran if it did not make a deal with the United States to ensure it did not develop a nuclear weapon.",
      "\u201cIf they don\u2019t make a deal,\u201d Trump said about Iran, \u201cthere will be bombing. It will be bombing the likes of which they have never seen before.\u201d",
      "U.S. and Iranian officials are \u201ctalking,\u201d Trump said.",

      "A government-sponsored junk food ban in schools across Mexico took effect on Saturday, officials said, as the country tries to tackle one of the world\u2019s worst obesity and diabetes epidemics.",
      "The health guidelines, first published last fall, take a direct shot at salty and sweet processed products that have become a staple for generations of Mexican schoolchildren, such as sugary fruit drinks, packaged chips, artificial pork rinds and soy-encased, chili-flavored peanuts.",
      "Announcing that the ban had become law, Mexico\u2019s Education Ministry posted on X: \u201cFarewell, junk food!\u201d It encouraged parents to support the government\u2019s crusade by cooking healthy meals for their kids.",
      "\u201cOne of the core principles of the new Mexican school system is healthy living,\u201d said Mario Delgado, the public health secretary. \u201cThere\u2019s a high level of acceptance of this policy among parents.\u201d",
      "Mexico\u2019s ambitious attempt to remake its food culture and reprogram the next generation of consumers is being watched closely around the world as governments struggle to turn the tide on a\u00a0global obesity epidemic.",
      "In the United States, for instance, the Trump administration\u2019s health secretary,\u00a0Robert F. Kennedy Jr., has vowed to upend the nation\u2019s food system and \u201c\u00a0Make America Healthy Again\u00a0\u201c by targeting ultra-processed foods to\u00a0curb surging obesity\u00a0and disease.",
      "Under Mexico\u2019s new order, schools must phase out any food and beverage displaying\u00a0even one black warning logo\u00a0marking it as high in salt, sugar, calories and fat. Mexico implemented that\u00a0compulsory front-of-package labeling system in 2020.",
      "Enforced from Monday morning, the start of the school week, the junk food ban also requires schools to serve more nutritious alternatives to junk food, like bean tacos, and offer plain drinking water.",
      "\u201cIt is much better to eat a bean taco than a bag of potato chips,\u201d said\u00a0Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum, who has championed the ban.",
      "Mexico\u2019s children consume more junk food than anywhere else in Latin America, according to UNICEF, which classifies the nation\u2019s childhood obesity epidemic as an emergency. Sugary drinks and highly processed foods account for 40% of the total calories that children consume in a day, the agency reports.",
      "\u201cAt my daughter\u2019s school, they told us that future activities wouldn\u2019t have candy, it would be completely different, with fruit, vegetables and other food that\u2019s healthy for kids,\u201d said Aurora Mart\u00ednez, a mother of two. \u201cIt will help us a lot.\u201d",
      "One-third of Mexican children are already considered overweight or obese, according to government statistics.",
      "School administrators found in violation of the order face stiff fines, ranging from $545 to $5,450.",
      "But enforcement poses a challenge in a country where\u00a0previous junk food bans\u00a0have struggled to gain traction and monitoring has been lax across Mexico\u2019s 255,000 schools, many of which lack water fountains \u2014 even reliable internet and electricity.",
      "It also wasn\u2019t immediately clear how the government would forbid the sale of junk food on sidewalks outside school campuses, where street vendors typically hawk candy, chips, nachos and ice cream to kids during recess and after the school day ends.",
      "\u201cIt will be difficult,\u201d said Abril Geraldine Rose de Le\u00f3n, a child therapist. \u201cBut it will be achieved in the long run.\u201d"

      "President Masoud Pezeshkian\u00a0said Iran\u2019s response, delivered via the sultanate of Oman, left open the possibility of indirect negotiations with Washington. However, such talks have made no progress since Trump in his first term unilaterally withdrew America from Tehran\u2019s nuclear deal with world powers in 2018.",
      "In the years since, regional tensions have boiled over into attacks at\u00a0sea\u00a0and on\u00a0land. Then came\u00a0the Israel-Hamas war\u00a0in the Gaza Strip, which saw Israel target militant group leaders across Iran\u2019s self-described \u201cAxis of Resistance.\u201d Now,\u00a0as the U.S. conducts intense airstrikes targeting the Iranian-backed Houthi rebels of Yemen, the risk of military action targeting Iran\u2019s nuclear program remains on the table.",

      "The White House offered no immediate reaction to the announcement.",
      "Iran\u2019s position hardens after Trump\u2019s letter",
      "Having Pezeshkian announced the decision shows just how much has changed in Iran since his election half a year ago after he campaigned on a promise to re-engage with the West.",
      "Since Trump\u2019s election and the resumption of his \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d campaign on Tehran, Iran\u2019s rial currency has gone into a freefall. Pezeshkian had left open talks up until Iran\u2019s 85-year-old Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei came down hard on Trump in February and warned\u00a0talks \u201care not intelligent, wise or honorable\u201d\u00a0with his administration. The Iranian president then immediately toughened his own remarks on the U.S.",
      "Meanwhile, there have been mixed messages coming from Iran for weeks. Videos from Quds, or Jerusalem, Day demonstrations on Friday had people in the crowds instructing participants to only shout: \u201cDeath to Israel!\u201d Typically, \u201cDeath to America\u201d was also heard.",
      "A video of an underground missile base unveiled by Iran\u2019s hard-line paramilitary Revolutionary Guard also showed its troops stepping on an Israeli flag painted on the ground \u2014 though there was no American flag as often seen in such propaganda videos.",
      "But Press TV, the English-language arm of Iranian state television, published an article last week that included listing U.S. bases in the Middle East as possible targets of attack. The list included Camp Thunder Cove on Diego Garcia in the Indian Ocean, where\u00a0the U.S. is basing stealth B-2 bombers\u00a0likely being used in Yemen.",
      "\u201cThe Americans themselves know how vulnerable they are,\u201d warned Iranian parliament speaker Mohammad Bagher Qalibaf on Friday. \u201cIf they violate Iran\u2019s sovereignty, it will be like a spark in a gunpowder depot, setting the entire region ablaze. In such a scenario, their bases and their allies will not be safe.\u201d",
      "However,\u00a0Tehran\u2019s two recent direct attacks on Israel\u00a0with ballistic missiles and drones caused negligible damage, while\u00a0Israel responded by destroying Iranian air defense systems.",
      "Iran\u2019s rejection is the latest in tensions over nuclear program",
      "Trump\u2019s letter arrived in Tehran on March 12. Though announcing he wrote it in a television interview, Trump offered little detail on what he exactly told the supreme leader.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve written them a letter saying, \u2018I hope you\u2019re going to negotiate because if we have to go in militarily, it\u2019s going to be a terrible thing,\u2019\u201d Trump said in the interview.",
      "The move recalled Trump\u2019s letter-writing to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in his first term, which led to face-to-face meetings but\u00a0no deals to limit Pyongyang\u2019s atomic bombs\u00a0and a missile program capable of reaching the continental U.S.",
      "The last time Trump tried to send a letter to Khamenei, through the late Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe in 2019, the supreme leader mocked the effort.",
      "Trump\u2019s letter came as both Israel and the United States have warned they will never let Iran acquire a nuclear weapon, leading to fears of a military confrontation as Tehran enriches uranium at near weapons-grade levels of 60% purity \u2014 something only done by atomic-armed nations.",
      "Iran has long maintained its program is for peaceful purposes, even as its officials increasingly threaten to pursue the bomb. A report in February, however, by\u00a0the U.N.\u2019s nuclear watchdog said Iran has accelerated its production\u00a0of near weapons-grade uranium.",
      "Iran\u2019s reluctance to deal with Trump likely also takes root in his ordering the attack that\u00a0killed Iranian Gen. Qassem Soleimani in a Baghdad drone strike\u00a0in January 2020. The U.S. has said\u00a0Iran plotted to assassinate Trump\u00a0over that prior to his election this November, something Tehran denied though officials have threatened him."
