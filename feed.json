      "LAS VEGAS -- The 2025 box office has been hit with a deficit. Can the James Gunn-dubbed \u201csummer of \u2018Superman\u2019\u201d save it?",
      "Warner Bros. showed off a diverse and starry slate of its upcoming films on Tuesday \u2014 but the night was carried on the shoulders of Clark Kent.",
      "\u201cI really do believe in this movie. And I do believe that there is a lack of human kindness, or at least a degradation of human kindness,\u201d Gunn said. \"This is a movie that celebrates kindness and human love.\u201d",
      "At the annual CinemaCon convention and trade show in Las Vegas, Gunn \u2014 the director and writer of the first film in the new iteration of the connected DC Universe \u2014 also brought out its stars, who gushed over their experience making the film.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a great honor to play a role that exists so clearly in the public consciousness, to the point where everyone I think, even if you haven\u2019t seen a film or read a comic, you sort of know what the Superman symbol means and you know what it stands for,\u201d said David Corenswet, adding that he hopes to \u201cilluminate something new about the character, or even just bring the beloved character to a new audience.\u201d",
      "Corenswet was joined onstage by Rachel Brosnahan, who plays Lois Lane, and Nicholas Hoult, who plays Lex Luther.",
      "\u201cJames makes a family out of every set,\u201d Brosnahan said. \u201cThe set is full of people who want to be there, who love making these movies. And it\u2019s such a joy to come to work every day. As many of you have probably heard from other people, it\u2019s not always like that.\u201d",
      "Gunn was announced to direct the film in 2023 shortly after he and Peter Safran became co-chairmen and co-CEOs of DC Studios.",
      "\u201cWe appreciate and share your passion for this art form,\u201d Safran told a room full of theater owners. \u201cIt\u2019s the fulcrum of our ambitious DC Studios slate and it\u2019s what inspired James to shoot all over the world and push filmmaking technology to its limits, to propel moviegoers out of their homes into your theaters.\u201d",
      "The film will be released theatrically in July amid a summer of superhero titles, including \u201cThe Fantastic Four: First Steps\u201d and \u201cThunderbolts(asterisk).\u201d",
      "In addition to \u201cSuperman,\u201d Warner Bros. teased some of its April releases on the convention\u2019s main stage, like Ryan Coogler\u2019s \u201cSinners\u201d and \u201cA Minecraft Movie,\u201d but they also looked further down the road for 2025.",
      "In a nod to cinephiles, the studio kicked off its presentation by bringing out the stars of Paul Thomas Anderson\u2019s \u201cOne Battle After Another,\u201d including Leonardo DiCaprio and Regina Hall. The film is set to hit theaters in September.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve been wanting to work with Paul for over, gosh, almost 20 years now. He\u2019s one of the most unique talents of our time,\u201d DiCaprio said. \u201cWith this film, he\u2019s tapped into something politically and culturally that is brewing beneath our psyche. But at the same time, it\u2019s an incredibly epic movie and has such scope and scale.\u201d",
      "Director Joseph Kosinski and producer Jerry Bruckheimer also treated the audience to an extended sneak peak of \u201cF1,\u201d Brad Pitt\u2019s Formula One racing drama premiering in June.",
      "In addition to Hollywood studios and stars boasting their theatrical menus which they believe will lure audiences to cinemas, the annual convention is also a time to discuss current industry debates, like how long movies should stay in theaters and the extent to which studios should get into production with streaming companies.",

      "The jokesters' custom has been around for hundreds of years, although its exact birth is difficult to pinpoint. These days, depending on your location, it could be marked with a fish secretly pinned to someone's back or a whoopee cushion or even news reports of flying penguins (yes, that actually happened ).",
      "In the U.S., the pranks are typically followed by screams of \u201cApril Fools!\u201d to make sure all are aware that they were the unsuspecting recipient of a practical joke.",

      "There are plenty of theories about where this day of pranks and hoaxes came from. It's not clear exactly which one might be true. But what is clear is that April Fools\u2019 Day has roots stretching back hundreds of years.",
      "One idea is that it dates back to France in 1564, when King Charles IX moved the New Year celebration from its weeklong observance beginning March 25 to a celebration on Jan. 1, according to the Library of Congress. Those who forgot or were never told about the change were mocked. Although the library notes that the true history of the New Year is more complicated, as different parts of the country observed it on different days.",
      "A similar theory ties April Fools\u2019 Day to the 1582 change from the Julian to the Gregorian calendar, according to the library. But it explains that this type of origin story has been used to explain several holidays and may be more of a \u201cmigratory legend.\u201d",
      "And then there's the theory that it could be connected to the March 21 vernal equinox, which is known as a day when people are tricked by unexpected weather changes, according to Encyclopedia Britannica.",
      "Whatever its origin, the first time there was clear documented reference to the day was in 1561 when the Flemish writer Eduard De Dene wrote in his poem about a nobleman sending his servant on pointless tasks, according to the Library of Congress. The servant soon realizes that he has been \u201csent on \u2018fool\u2019s errands\u2019 because it\u2019s April 1,\u201d the library states.",
      "In 2021, then-first lady Jill Biden pretended to be a flight attendant on an airplane traveling from California to Washington. She wore a \u201cJasmine\u201d nametag and passed out Dove ice cream bars while wearing a black mask, black pantsuit and wig. A few minutes later, \u201cJasmine\u201d reemerged without the wig \u2014 revealing herself to be Jill Biden, laughing and proclaiming, \u201cApril Fools!\u201d",
      "Google co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin became known for announcing outlandish ideas every April Fools\u2019 Day soon after starting their company more than a quarter century ago. One year, Google posted a job opening for a Copernicus research center on the moon. Another year, the company said it planned to roll out a \u201cscratch and sniff\u201d feature on its search engine.",
      "In 1992, NPR 's \u201cTalk of the Nation\u201d program announced that former-President Richard Nixon, who resigned in 1974, would be running for president, according to the Museum of Hoaxes. A comedian had impersonated Nixon to say, \u201cI never did anything wrong, and I won\u2019t do it again.\u201d",
      "Outside of the U.S., one of the most notable pranks involved the BBC World Service in 1980 declaring that Big Ben would become a digital clock and renamed Digital Dave, according to the UK Parliament.",
      "From Scotland to Iceland to the U.S., the day is honored in a wide array of ways.",
      "In France, the day is known as poisson d\u2019avril, or \u201cApril Fish,\u201d and has long had a fish-themed pranking tradition. In modern times, it\u2019s become more of a day for children to relish in attaching paper fish to their friends\u2019 backs, Atlas Obscura says.",
      "In Scotland, April Fools' has a history of being a two-day event. April 1 is known as \u201cGowkie Day\u201d or \u201cHunt the Gowk,\u201d explained Encyclopedia Britannica. Gowk is a term used to describe a fool. On April 2, the celebration may become more physical, with children attaching \u201ckick me\u201d signs to people\u2019s backs.",
      "The day is also celebrated in Iceland, with the aim being to get people to \u201chlaupa apr\u00edl,\u201d or \u201cmake an April run.\u201d In other words, to trick someone in a way that makes them travel to a different location. News agencies have also been known to participate in pranking people.

      "The partially mummified remains of Hackman and Arakawa were found in their Santa Fe home on Feb. 26, when maintenance and security workers showed up at the home and alerted police.",
      "Authorities have said Hackman, 95, died of heart disease with complications from Alzheimer\u2019s disease about a week after his wife died of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, which is a rare, rodent-borne disease. Hackman may have been unaware Arakawa, 65, was dead.",
      "One of the couple\u2019s three dogs, a kelpie mix named Zinna, also was found dead in a crate in a bathroom closet near Arakawa, while two other dogs were found alive. A state veterinary lab tied the dog's death to dehydration and starvation.",
      "Authorities unraveled the mysterious circumstances of the couple\u2019s deaths and described their conclusions at a March 7 news conference without releasing most related written and photographic records.",
      "New Mexico\u2019s open records law blocks public access to sensitive images, including depictions of dead bodies. Experts also say some medical information is not considered public record under the state Inspection of Public Records Act.",
      "In seeking to block the release of records, estate representative Julia Peters had emphasized the possibly shocking nature of photographs and video in the investigation and potential for their dissemination by media. The Hackman family estate also sought to block the eventual release of autopsy reports by the Office of the Medical Investigator and death investigation reports by the Santa Fe County Sheriff\u2019s Office.",
      "An attorney for the estate, Kurt Sommer, argued during Monday's hearing that the couple took great pains to stay out of the public light during their lifetimes and that the right to control the use of their names and likenesses should extend to their estate in death.",
      "The bulk of death investigations by law enforcement and autopsy reports by medical investigators are typically considered public records under state law in the spirit of ensuring government transparency and accountability.",
      "The Associated Press, CBS News and CBS Studios intervened in the matter. Gregory P. Williams, an attorney for the news outlets, told the judge that they had previously said in court filings that they would not disseminate images of the couple's bodies and would blur images to obscure them from other records.",
      "\u201cThere is certainly a public interest in knowing how their deaths were investigated and knowing how that was handled,\u201d Williams said.",
      "Susan Madore, a publicist who had worked with the Hackmans for years, testified that the couple relished living in Santa Fe because it afforded them anonymity. Hackman retired in the early 2000s.",
      "Arakawa had no children, while Hackman is survived by three children from a previous marriage.",
      "At Monday's hearing, an attorney for Hackman's son and daughters highlighted the possible traumatic effects of releasing conversations about the deaths within police body camera videos.",
      "Scot Sauder, an attorney for the state medical investigator, told the judge that autopsy reports for Hackman and his wife do not yet exist and won\u2019t include past health care information once completed. It can take months for autopsy reports to be completed.",
      "Privacy likely also will play a role as the couple\u2019s estate is settled. According to probate court documents, Hackman signed an updated will in 2005 leaving his estate to his wife while the will she signed that year directed her estate to him. With both dying, management of the estate is in Peters' hands.",
      "Without trust documents being made public, it\u2019s unclear who the beneficiaries are and how the assets will be divided.",

      "NEW YORK -- In an unexpected upset, the Jason Statham thriller \u201cA Working Man\u201d took No. 1 at the box office, besting the rapidly declining \u201cSnow White,\u201d according to studio estimates Sunday.",
      "Even after a lackluster debut, the Walt Disney Co.\u2019s live-action remake was predicted to remain the top film in U.S. and Canadian theaters over the weekend. Instead, \u201cSnow White,\u201d plagued by bad buzz and backlash, nosedived in its second weekend and dropped 66%.",
      "At the same time, Amazon MGM Studios\u2019 \u201cA Working Man,\u201d directed by David Ayer, beat expectations with a $15.2 million debut. Co-written by Sylvester Stallone, \u201cA Working Man\u201d reteams Statham and Ayer following last year\u2019s successful \u201cThe Beekeeper\u201d ($162 million worldwide).

      "While reviews have been mixed and audiences only gave \u201cA Working Man\u201d a \u201cB\u201d CinemaScore, showing Statham has carved out something rare in the movie industry today: bankability. \u201cA Working Man\u201d opened similarly to \u201cThe Beekeeper,\u201d which launched with $16.5 million.",
      "The bigger headline, though, might have been the fast erosion of ticket buyers' appetite for \u201cSnow White.\u201d The film, directed by Marc Webb and starring Rachel Zegler, had been hoped to lift movie theaters after a painful start to 2025. Produced for more $250 million, the film has turned into a poisoned apple, with a two-week global haul of $143.1 million.",

      "\u201cThe Chosen: The Last Supper,\u201d fared the best, with $11.5 million in 2,235 theaters. The Christian TV series, now in its fifth season, has regularly driven ticket sales before streaming. More episodes will roll out in theaters through April.",
      "\u201cDeath of a Unicorn,\u201d a horror comedy starring Jenna Ortega and Paul Rudd, portrays a father and daughter who hit a unicorn on the road while they're driving. The movie collected a modest $5.8 million from 3,050 theaters.",
      "The weekend\u2019s more straightforward horror contender, Blumhouse\u2019s \u201cThe Woman in the Yard,\u201d starring Danielle Deadwyler, debuted with $9.4 million from 2,842 cinemas. In \u201cBlack Adam\u201d director Jaume Collet-Serra\u2019s film, a mysterious woman keeps appearing in a family\u2019s front yard. Though it cost little to make, with a production budget of $12 million, it has been slammed by critics.",

      "LOS ANGELES -- Richard Chamberlain, the handsome hero of the 1960s television series \"Dr. Kildare\" who found a second career as an award-winning \"king of the miniseries,\" has died. He was 90.",
      "Chamberlain died Saturday night in Waimanalo, Hawaii, of complications following a stroke, according to his publicist, Harlan Boll.",
      "\u201cOur beloved Richard is with the angels now. He is free and soaring to those loved ones before us,\" Martin Rabbett, his lifelong partner, said in a statement. \"How blessed were we to have known such an amazing and loving soul. Love never dies. And our love is under his wings lifting him to his next great adventure.\u201d",
      "Tall, with classic good looks and romantic style, Chamberlain became an instant favorite with teenage girls as the compassionate physician on the TV series that aired from 1961 to 1966. Photoplay magazine named him most popular male star for three years in a row, from 1963-65.",
      "Not until 2003 did he acknowledge publicly what Hollywood insiders had long known, that he was gay. He made the revelation in his autobiography, \"Shattered Love.\"",
      "The actor became known as \"king of the TV miniseries\" in 1978 when he landed the starring role in \"Centennial,\" an epic production 24 hours long and based on James Michener's sprawling novel. He followed that in 1980 with \"Shogun,\" another costly, epic miniseries based on James Clavell's period piece about an American visitor to Japan.",
      "He scored his greatest miniseries success in 1983 with another long-form drama, \"The Thorn Birds,\" based on Colleen McCullough's best-seller. He played Father Ralph de Bricassart, a Roman Catholic priest in Australia who falls in love with beautiful Meggie Cleary (Rachel Ward). The ABC production, which also starred Barbara Stanwyck, reportedly attracted 100 million viewers.",
      "Chamberlain won Golden Globes for his work in \u201cShogun\" and \u201cThe Thorn Birds.\u201d Years earlier, he received one for \u201cDr. Kildare.\u201d",
      "When the public began to lose interest in miniseries, Chamberlain turned to the theater, where he displayed a fine singing voice. He appeared as Henry Higgins in a 1994 Broadway revival of \"My Fair Lady\" and as Captain von Trapp in a 1999 revival of \"The Sound of Music.\"",
      "He reprised his role of de Bricassart in the 1996 TV movie \"The Thorn Birds: The Missing Years.\"",
      "He also appeared in numerous films, including \"The Music Lovers\" (as Tchaikovsky), \"The Madwoman of Chaillot,\" \"The Towering Inferno\" and \"The Three Musketeers\" and its sequels.",
      "The \"Kildare\" series was based on a string of successful 1930s and '40s films that had starred Lew Ayres in the title role.",
      "Chamberlain's hunky, all-American appearance made him an overnight star. Another medical show that debuted the same season, \"Ben Casey,\" also was a smash and made its leading man, the darkly handsome Vince Edwards, a star, too.",
      "The \"Ben Casey shirt\" became a fashion item, both shows' theme songs made the pop Top 40 (the Kildare song performed by Chamberlain himself) and there was even a pop song called \"Dr. Kildare! Dr. Casey! You Are Wanted for Consultation.\"",
      "But in his book, Chamberlain recounted how he was forced to hide his sexuality. He would escort glamorous actresses to movie premieres and other public events at the request of studio executives and dodge reporters' questions about why he had never married with a stock reply: \"Getting married would be great, but I'm awfully busy now.\"",
      "\"When I grew up, being gay, being a sissy or anything like that was verboten,\" he said in an NBC interview. \"I disliked myself intensely and feared this part of myself intensely and had to hide it.\"",
      "The book also described a troubled childhood and an alcoholic father, and Chamberlain said that writing it finally lifted a heavy emotional burden. He also expressed relief that he was no longer hiding his sexuality.",
      "\"I played a cat-and-mouse game with the press. Game over,\" said Chamberlain.",
      "Born George Richard Chamberlain in Beverly Hills on March 31, 1934, the actor originally studied at Pomona College to be a painter. But after returning from the Army, where he had served as an infantry clerk in the Korean War, Chamberlain decided to try acting.",
      "He studied voice and drama, and after appearing in guest roles in a handful of TV shows and in the 1960 film \"The Secret of the Purple Reef,\" he won the Dr. Kildare role.",
      "When \u201cDr. Kildare\u201d was canceled he initially found it difficult to shake the image of the handsome young physician.",
      "He moved to England for a time to find work and hone his acting skills. While there, he appeared in three of director Richard Lester\u2019s films, \u201cPetulia\u201d (1968), \u201cThe Three Musketeers\u201d (1973) and \u201cThe Four Musketeers\u201d (1974). He reunited with Lester in 1989 for \u201cThe Return of the Musketeers,\u201d once more playing Aramis.",
      "In 1969, Chamberlain played the title role in \u201cHamlet\u201d at England\u2019s Birmingham Repertory Company and repeated it in a TV adaptation that appeared on NBC in the United States. He also appeared as Octavius in a film version of \u201cJulius Caesar,\u201d which co-starred Charlton Heston and Jason Robards.",
      "He continued to act well into the 21st century, appearing on such television shows as \u201cWill & Grace,\u201d \u201cThe Drew Carey Show\u201d and \u201cTouched by an Angel.\u201d",

      "NEW YORK -- After mounting criticism following its initial response to the violent attack on Oscar-winning \u201cNo Other Land\u201d co-director Hamdan Ballal, the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences apologized Friday for not acknowledging Ballal by name.",
      "In a letter to academy members, academy CEO Bill Kramer and its president, Janet Yang, said they regretted not issuing a direct statement on Ballal. The director on Monday, witnesses said, was beaten by Israeli settlers in the West Bank and then detained by the Israeli military.",
      "The attack, just weeks after Ballal and his fellow directors won best documentary at the Academy Awards, was widely condemned by numerous film organizations, among others. The academy on Wednesday released a statement condemning \u201charming or suppressing artists for their work or their viewpoints.\"",
      "Yuval Abraham, a journalist and co-director of \u201cNo Other Land,\u201d was highly critical of that response, comparing it to \u201csilence on Hamdan's assault.\"",
      "On Friday, more than 600 of the academy's 11,000 members issued an open letter saying the academy's statement \"fell far short of the sentiments this moment calls for.\u201d Among the signatories were Joaquin Phoenix, Olivia Colman, Riz Ahmed, Emma Thompson, Javier Bardem, Pen\u00e9lope Cruz and \u201cThe Zone of Interest\u201d filmmaker Jonathan Glazer.",
      "After a meeting Friday by the academy's board of governors, Kramer and Yang responded with a new statement.",
      "\u201cWe sincerely apologize to Mr. Ballal and all artists who felt unsupported by our previous statement and want to make it clear that the academy condemns violence of this kind anywhere in the world,\u201d they wrote to members. \"We abhor the suppression of free speech under any circumstances.\u201d",
      "After being detained for more than 20 hours, Ballal was released by Israeli soldiers. Ballal and two other Palestinians were accused of throwing stones at a settler, allegations they deny. After being released, Ballal told The Associated Press a settler kicked his head \u201clike a football\u201d during an attack on his village.",
      "\u201cI realized they were attacking me specifically,\u201d Ballal said at a West Bank hospital after his release Tuesday. \u201cWhen they say \u2018Oscar\u2019, you understand. When they say your name, you understand.\u201d",
      "\u201cNo Other Land,\u201d a joint Israeli-Palestinian production, chronicles the situation in Masafer Yatta, which the Israeli military designated as a live-fire training zone in the 1980s and ordered the expulsion of the residents, mostly Arab Bedouin. Around 1,000 residents have largely remained in place, but soldiers regularly come in to demolish homes, tents, water tanks and olive orchards.",
      "After not finding a U.S. distributor despite wide acclaim, \u201cNo Other Land\u201d was self-released in theaters. It still managed to surpass $2 million in North American theaters.",

      "\u201cWe just loved what the WWE brought to our childhood,\u201d the retired New England Patriots tight end said. \u201cThe characters. It wasn\u2019t even about the fights in the ring. It was how awesome these guys as personalities were.\u201d",
      "Gronk grew into one of the most supersized characters of \u2019em all.",
      "So it was of little surprise that the fun-loving, fearless Gronkowski\u2019s charisma and hulking muscles made him a natural fit as a WWE star.",
      "He hosted WrestleMania in 2020. He was provoked into jumping the rail and hit the ring at another WrestleMania after bad guy Jinder Mahal tossed a drink in his face. And yes, four Super Bowl rings are nice, but how many NFL stars can claim they were WWE 24/7 champion like Gronkowski? Gronkowski successfully won the only wrestling title that had the caveat of being defended against anyone, anywhere, any time.",

Gronkowski will throw his party after Sunday night's show.",
      "\u201cWrestleMania gets the same amount of people as the Super Bowl and they don\u2019t have all those parties that surround it like the Super Bowl does,\u201d Gronkowski said. \u201cIt was such a good idea to bring Gronk Beach to WrestleMania because of that reason.\u201d",
      "While pro wrestling is built on the swerve \u2014 the art of delivering fans the unexpected \u2014 Gronkowski said he would not compete at WrestleMania, citing his brother\u2019s wedding on that Saturday night.",
      "\u201cI will not be in the ring at WrestleMania,\u201d he said. \u201cI really wish I could possibly do something.\u201d",

      "The Sex Pistols will tour North America for the first time since 2003 this fall",
      "NEW YORK -- It wasn't the night punk broke, but it was close. Nearly 50 years ago, the Sex Pistols \u2014 then made up of vocalist Johnny Rotten, guitarist Steve Jones, drummer Paul Cook and bassist Glen Matlock \u2014 performed at the 100 Club Punk Special in London, a 140-capacity club, alongside Subway Sect, Siouxsie and the Banshees and The Clash.",
      "The event marked a shift for the subcultural movement; the bands here would soon bring their underground culture to reach mainstream heights.",
      "Now, the 2025 iteration of the Pistols \u2014 Jones, Cooke and Matlock joined by frontman Frank Carter (of Gallows, Pure Love and Frank Carter and the Rattlesnakes) \u2014 sit in the same venue to discuss their forthcoming North American tour. \u201cThis is where it all kicked off, really, all the punk,\u201d says Cook.",
      "This fall, the legendary punk band will embark on their first tour of North America since 2003, when they were joined by John Lydon (formerly Rotten.) The 2025 run with Carter begins Sept. 16 at the Longhorn Ballroom in Dallas, Texas \u2014 the site of a particularly hostile show for the band when it first toured the U.S. in 1978.",
      "Jones recalls having \u201cpigs' hooves and bottles and what not slung at us by cowboys.\u201d",
      "It is one of a few dates featured in three \u201cLive in the U.S.A.\u201d albums, documenting the band's '78 run: Atlanta, Dallas and San Francisco. The latter will release April 25 and captures the show where the band originally called it quits.",
      "\"We were thinking of breaking up in San Francisco again,\" Jones jokes.",
      "The 2025 tour is currently scheduled to conclude Oct. 16 at the Hollywood Palladium in Los Angeles. The band will hit Washington; Philadelphia; Brooklyn, New York; Montreal; Toronto; Cleveland; Detroit; Minneapolis; Denver; Seattle and San Francisco. Additional tour dates will be announced later.",
      "Pre-sale opens April 2 and 3. Tickets go on sale April 4 at 10 a.m. local time.",
      "They will perform the band's sole album, 1977\u2019s \u201cNever Mind the Bollocks, Here\u2019s the Sex Pistols Album\u201d live in its entirety as well as other material.",
      "So, why tour the U.S. and Canada now?",
      "\u201cWhy not?\u201d says Jones.",
      "\u201cI think everybody needs this band right now. I think the world needs this band right now,\u201d says Carter. \u201cAnd I think definitely America is screaming out for a band like the Sex Pistols.\u201d",
      "\u201cAt the end of the day, we\u2019re living in a really, really difficult time. So not only do people want to come and just be entertained, they want to enjoy themselves,\u201d he continued. \u201cPunk is an energetic music. It\u2019s one where you can go and vent and let your hair down, hopefully in a safe manner. Fingers crossed, no bottles or pigs' hooves.\u201d",
      "Carter fronted the Sex Pistols last year for a few U.K. dates. The band says they did not reach out to Lydon to see if he wanted to participate in this reunion tour.",
      "\u201cThe last thing he wants to do is have anything to do with us right now,\u201d says Jones, referring to a previous lawsuit between the singer and the band over music use in their TV series \u201cPistol.\u201d The judge ruled against Lydon's opposition.",
      "\u201cWe wish him the best,\" Jones said.",
      "\u201cGood luck to him,\u201d adds Matlock. \u201cI wish he thinks, maybe, \u2018good luck\u2019 to us. Probably doesn't. But over the years, John (has had) all our phone numbers, and I can't see many missed calls from him.\u201d",
      "As for the 2025 tour: Fans shouldn't expect the violence of their 1978 run, but they should anticipate a tighter performance.",
      "\u201cWe're a bit older but we play just as well, if not better,\u201d says Matlock. \u201cAnd I think that\u2019s something that\u2019s got a great deal of aplomb that we\u2019re going to bring to the public over there.\u201d",
      "Does this mean there could be new Sex Pistols music in the future? \u201cIt's early days,\u201d says Jones. \u201cLet's see what happens.\u201d",

      "At Hong Kong\u2019s Art Basel, painter Chow Chun-fai\u2019s new works transport viewers back to the night in 1997 when the former British colony returned to Chinese rule, displayed in the very exhibition center where one era ended and another began",
      "HONG KONG -- At Hong Kong\u2019s Art Basel, painter Chow Chun-fai\u2019s new works transport viewers back to the night in 1997 when the former British colony returned to Chinese rule, displayed in the very exhibition center where one era ended and another began.",
      "That transformation in the city's post-colonial era has taken a drastic turn since 2020, when China imposed a national security law that virtually wiped out dissent. The law drove many middle-class families and young professionals, including artists, to emigrate to democracies like Britain, Canada, Taiwan and the U.S. from what was once a haven for free expression in Asia.",
      "But others, like Chow, chose to stay and continue to document their home city despite unclear red lines. His works at Art Basel, which opens to the public on Friday, revisit Hong Kongers\u2019 collective memories of the late 1990s and early 2000s, a time many were proud of the Chinese financial hub\u2019s vibrancy and openness.",
      "\u201cWhile studying art, we\u2019ve learned many artists faced momentous times. Since we are living through such a momentous time ourselves now, I will continue to learn from it,\" he said in an interview ahead of the exhibition.",
      "Chow is perhaps best known to those outside art circles for his witty recreations of classic movie scenes with bilingual subtitles that lead audiences to reflect on Hong Kong's history and identity. He was also in the news when he ran against pro-establishment candidates in the 2012 legislative election and the 2016 election committee race, though he ultimately lost both contests.",
      "At Art Basel, Chow's paintings revisit significant news events, from the 1997 handover and overseas trips made by former top Chinese leaders to the celebration of China becoming the host of the 2008 Olympic Games.",
      "His works center on some of the biggest news stories covered by Sharon Cheung, a former journalist and now local gallery director.",
      "In 2000, late former Chinese President Jiang Zemin berated Cheung for asking what he called \u201ctoo simple, sometimes naive\u201d questions. She'd asked Jiang if his support for then-Hong Kong leader Tung Chee-hwa gave the impression of an imperial-style appointment. One of Chow\u2019s paintings illustrates that scene.",
      "Another set of Chow's paintings that will be shown, titled \u201cPanda,\u201d captures Jiang\u2019s personality from another side, documenting his light-hearted response to a question about pandas during a 2002 U.S. trip. He replied in English with a laugh: \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I am an electrical power engineer.\" Zhang said he was not a panda expert and quoted a Confucian saying about the virtue of acknowledging what one doesn\u2019t know.",
      "Chow said he included the work in the exhibition because pandas have become a trending topic in Hong Kong, where twins born last year sparked a bear craze. Jiang's response shows the characteristics of Chinese leaders back then, he said.",
      "Some 20 years later, Chinese leaders no longer have such open exchanges with Hong Kong journalists. Last year, China\u2019s government even eliminated an annual news conference by the premier, one of the rare times a top Chinese leader took questions from journalists.",
      "In Hong Kong, Beijing has doubled down on its control following 2019 anti-government protests. Many leading pro-democracy activists were prosecuted and jailed under the security law. Apple Daily and Stand News, news outlets known for their critical reports of the government, were shut down in 2021 after their top editors were arrested.",
      "The cultural sector has felt the chilling effect.",
      "In 2021, the government introduced amendments to its film censorship law on national security grounds. Some filmmakers have stopped screening their work in the city. Cultural works that diverge from government positions have lost funding. Booksellers practice self-censorship at the city's book fair, and local libraries in 2023 pulled titles related to the 1989 Tiananmen Square crackdown in Beijing and some political figures.",
      "Cheung, director of SC Gallery, said people have become more cautious about expressing their thoughts, but that she and Chow will not let fear stop them. Art\u2019s sense of distance allows room for interpretation, Cheung said.",
      "\u201cWe're not trying to tell people something. It's more about what people take away when they look at these images,\u201d she said.",
      "Chow said he never planned to leave Hong Kong despite the city's drastic changes, noting that artists who lived through major changes in the past produced great work.",
      "\u201cToday, finding ourselves in this moment of transformation, how could I, as a creative professional, not be here to witness it personally?\u201d he said.",

      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump on Thursday revealed his intention to force changes at the Smithsonian Institution with an executive order that targets funding for programs that advance \u201cdivisive narratives\u201d and \u201cimproper ideology,\" the latest step in a broadside against culture he deems too liberal.",
      "Trump claimed there has been a \u201cconcerted and widespread\u201d effort over the past decade to rewrite American history by replacing \u201cobjective facts\u201d with a \u201cdistorted narrative driven by ideology rather than truth,\" adding that it casts the \u201cfounding principles\u201d of the United States in a \u201cnegative light.\u201d",
      "The order he signed behind closed doors puts Vice President JD Vance, who serves on the Smithsonian Institution's Board of Regents, in charge of overseeing efforts to \u201cremove improper ideology\u201d from all areas of the institution, including its museums, education and research centers, and the National Zoo.",
      "It marks the Republican president's latest salvo against cultural pillars of society, such as universities and art, that he considers out of step with conservative sensibilities. Trump recently had himself installed as chairman of the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts with the aim of overhauling programming, including the annual Kennedy Center Honors awards show. The administration also recently forced Columbia University to make a series of policy changes by threatening the Ivy League school with the loss of several hundred million dollars in federal funding.",
      "The executive order also hints at the return of statues and monuments of Confederate figures, many of which were taken down or replaced around the country after the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis in 2020 and the rise of the Black Lives Matter movement, which is detested by Trump and other conservatives.",
      "The order also calls for improvements to Independence Hall in Philadelphia by July 4, 2026, in time for the 250th anniversary of the signing of the Declaration of Independence.",
      "Trump singled out the National Museum of African American History and Culture, which opened in 2016 near the White House, the Women's History Museum, which is in development, and the American Art Museum for criticism.",
      "\u201cMuseums in our Nation's capital should be places where individuals go to learn \u2014 not to be subjected to ideological indoctrination or divisive narratives that distort our shared history,\u201d he said.",
      "Linda St. Thomas, the Smithsonian Institution\u2019s chief spokesperson, said in an email late Thursday, \u201cWe have no comment for now.\u201d",
      "Under Trump\u2019s order, Vance will also work with the White House budget office to make sure future funding for the Smithsonian Institution isn\u2019t spent on programs that \u201cdegrade shared American values, divide Americans based on race, or promote programs or ideologies inconsistent with federal law and policy.\u201d Trump also wants to ensure that the women\u2019s history museum celebrates women and not \u201crecognize men as women in any respect.\u201d",
      "It also requires the interior secretary to reinstate monuments, memorials, statues and similar properties that have been removed or changed since Jan. 1, 2020, to \u201cperpetuate a false reconstruction of American history, inappropriately minimize the value of certain historical events or figures, or include any other improper partisan ideology.\u201d",
      "The Smithsonian Institution is the world\u2019s largest museum, education and research complex. It consists of 21 museums and the National Zoo. Eleven museums are located along the National Mall in Washington.",
      "The institution was established by Congress with money from James Smithson, a British scientist who left his estate to the United States to found \u201cat Washington, under the name of the Smithsonian Institution, an establishment for the increase and diffusion of knowledge.\u201d",

      "Yolanda Sald\u00edvar, 64, was up for parole for the first time since the killing of the singer, known to fans as simply Selena.",
      "One of the first Mexican American artists to break into the mainstream music scene, Selena shattered barriers for women in Latin music. She was 23 years old and on the verge of crossing over into English-language pop superstardom when she was killed.",
      "The singer's family and Chris P\u00e9rez, her widower, expressed gratitude to the Texas Board of Pardon and Paroles.",
      "\u201cWhile nothing can bring Selena back, this decision reaffirms that justice continues to stand for the beautiful life that was taken from us and from millions of fans around the world far too soon,\u201d they said in a statement posted on social media.",
      "In explaining the decision to deny parole, the board said in a statement that the panel found that Sald\u00edvar continues to pose a threat to public safety. It also said the nature of the crime indicated \u201ca conscious disregard for the lives, safety, or property of others.\u201d",
      "Sald\u00edvar, who is serving her sentence in a Gatesville prison, will be eligible to be reviewed again for parole in 2030.",
      "Sald\u00edvar founded Selena\u2019s fan club and was the manager of the singer\u2019s clothing boutiques, Selena Etc., until she was fired in early March 1995 after money was discovered missing.",
      "Selena, a Corpus Christi native, was shot in the back with a .38-caliber revolver at a Days Inn motel in Corpus Christi on March 31, 1995. She was able to run to the motel lobby, where she collapsed, and she was pronounced dead at a hospital an hour later.",

      "More than 50,000 people lined up to view Selena\u2019s body the day before she was laid to rest in Seaside Memorial Park on April 3, 1995, just 13 days before her 24th birthday.",
      "Sald\u00edvar\u2019s trial was moved to Houston because of the publicity surrounding the case. Sald\u00edvar testified that she had intended to kill herself during the confrontation with Selena but the gun misfired.",

      "In court documents from 2016, Sald\u00edvar said she was being held in protective custody \u2014 meaning she was segregated from other inmates \u2014 because prison officials were concerned for her safety due to the \u201chigh profile\u201d nature of her case. She filed several appeals of her conviction, but all were rejected.",
      "Known as \u201cthe Queen of Tejano,\u201d Selena rose to stardom and won a Grammy during a Tejano music boom in the early 1990s. Her hits included \u201cBidi Bidi Bom Bom,\u201d \u201cComo la Flor,\u201d \u201cAmor Prohibido,\u201d \u201cNo Me Queda Mas\u201d and \u201cTu Solo Tu.\u201d",

      "An upcoming memoir by retired Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy has a new title and release date",
      "An upcoming memoir by retired Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy has a new title and release date. Kennedy's book also will come out as a single publication, not in two volumes, as once planned.",
      "Simon & Schuster announced Thursday that \u201cLife, Law, & Liberty\u201d will be released Oct. 14, one year later than scheduled. Kennedy's memoir was originally titled \u201cLife and Law.\u201d A spokesperson for Simon & Schuster, which first announced Kennedy's book deal in 2024, said the changes were part of the \u201cnatural evolution of the editing process.\u201d",
      "The 88-year-old Kennedy, who stepped down from the court in 2018, is expected to trace his life from his childhood in Sacramento, California, to his 30 years as a justice. He was known as a moderate conservative who cast decisive votes on same-sex marriage, campaign finance and abortion, among other cases.",

      "\u201cASCO: Without Permission\u201d is director Travis Guti\u00e9rrez Senger's latest documentary and executive produced by Gael Garcia Bernal and Diego Luna",
      "LOS ANGELES -- When filmmaker Travis Guti\u00e9rrez Senger reflects on ASCO\u2019s legacy, he quickly notes they were more than an art group; they created a movement, one with remarkable influence on Chicano art history.",
      "\u201cThat movement continues today, and it\u2019s very expansive,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of books, films and things that will be written about ASCO over a period of time. And this was our contribution in some ways.\u201d",
      "He's referring to \u201cASCO: Without Permission,\u201d a documentary that chronicles the story of the 1970s art group founded by multidisciplinary artist Patssi Valdez, muralist Willie Herr\u00f3n III, painter and performance artist Gronk and writer and photographer Harry Gamboa Jr. They met as teens, formed as young adults, and called their group \u201casco\u201d \u2014 \u201cnausea\u201d or \u201cdisgust\u201d in Spanish \u2014 after one of their early DIY exhibits. Their conceptual work and performance art spoke to the exclusion of Chicanos from the mainstream art world and the systemic police brutality endured by the Mexican American community in East Los Angeles.",
      "All four founding members of ASCO became some of the most notable Chicano artists, later exhibiting works in revered museums around the United States. But in their early days, the group was denied access to the notable galleries and museums. They created their own avenues in the form of public performances, murals and more to exhibit their work, their way.",
      "\u201cTo behave badly is the most ethical thing you can do,\u201d said executive producer Gael Garc\u00eda Bernal at the film\u2019s South by Southwest film festival premiere earlier this month. \u201cYou\u2019re building identity and questioning and unmasking the facade and the farce that exists.\u201d",
      "Bernal and Diego Luna executive produced the film under their production company El Corriente del Golfo. The film has yet to find distribution.",
      "Speaking with The Associated Press, Gamboa and Valdez praised Guti\u00e9rrez Senger\u2019s approach to their history. Both members, who appear in the documentary, saw the film for the first time with a crowd of fans and a group of young Chicano artists whose art was inspired by ASCO\u2019s early rebellion.",
      "\u201cI felt the film really kind of captured the essence of all of us working together,\u201d said Gamboa.",
      "Valdez says it was a special moment for her, as the only woman in the founding group, to be given equal time and understanding.",
      "\u201cFor the first time, I was given an equal voice in the group that hadn\u2019t happened before,\u201d she said, citing how previous stories of the group only highlighted her male collaborators.",
      "ASCO emerged at the height of the Chicano civil rights movement in the 1960s and 1970s. It was a time of heightened political and racial tension amid the East LA walkouts, protesting education inequality, and the Chicano Moratorium, an anti-Vietnam War movement during which many Mexican Americans were victims of police brutality.",
      "Muralists and collectives popped up as Latino artists sought to process the systemic injustice taking place in their communities.",
      "\u201cThe response to such violence was to create art,\u201d said Gamboa Jr. He wanted to alter the mainstream perception of Chicanos and present the possibilities and avenues someone can create despite societal constraints.",
      "For Valdez, being the only woman meant she was no stranger to a double dose of both racism in society and the sexism weaved within conservative Latino households, where young women were expected to keep quiet.",
      "\u201cI couldn\u2019t stand it. So, I was able to act out these forms of censorship through the performance work in ASCO,\u201d said Valdez who once taped herself to a public wall in a piece titled \u201cInstant Mural,\u201d a metaphor on feeling captive.",
      "One of ASCO's most known works is \u201cSpray Paint LACMA.\u201d Gamboa, Gronk and Herr\u00f3n spray painted their names on the side of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art after Gamboa says he was told by a curator, \u201cChicanos are in gangs, they don\u2019t make art.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere was another era when people said, \u2018Latinx art, you know, doesn\u2019t exist. It\u2019s not a thing. It doesn\u2019t belong. It\u2019s not part of American art,\u2019\u201d said Pilar Tompkins-Rivas, the chief curator and deputy director of the Lucas Museum of Narrative Art.",
      "ASCO\u2019s neighborhood performance art would often draw stares, and even crowds. In \u201cStation of the Cross,\u201d the group carried a large cross to the local military recruiting office to protest the Vietnam War.",
      "In 1974, Gamboa took a photo of Gronk posed as the victim of gang violence to bring attention to the media\u2019s sensationalist coverage of crime in East Los Angeles. In the documentary, Gamboa claims that a local news station ran the piece as an actual story.",
      "ASCO\u2019s work as a group remained in obscurity from the mainstream. It was not until 2011 when LACMA mounted \u201cASCO: Elite of the Obscure, A Retrospective, 1972-1887,\u201d the first retrospective to present the group\u2019s performance and conceptual art. On display was an image of Valdez, taken by Gamboa, standing above the graffiti art. Life had presented ASCO with its full-circle moment.",
      "\u201cLatino history has always been erased,\u201d said Guti\u00e9rrez Senger. \u201c\u2018ASCO: Without Permission\u2019 is a story of winning a battle, not a war.\u201d",
      "A 1974 photograph of Valdez shows the artist glammed up in a gold top, holding a golden statue of a cobra. She had won best actress at the Aztlan No Movie Awards \u2014 a fictional award show ASCO created as commentary on the lack of Latino representation in Hollywood.",
      "The group was inspired by Hollywood cinema and popular culture, but knew the likelihood of starring in studio films was limited, unless they wanted to play a maid, cartel leader or gang member.",
      "\u201cHollywood movies, rock \u2019n\u2019 roll. That\u2019s what I was about,\u201d said Valdez. \u201cAnd that\u2019s why I responded in the way I did with my artmaking.\u201d",
      "Gamboa photographed Herr\u00f3n, Gronk and Valdez using cinema stock to capture the essence of their favorite films. The series was called \u201cNo Movies\u201d and later inspired their satirical award show.",
      "Guti\u00e9rrez Senger was drawn to it and pays homage throughout the documentary by featuring a group of young Chicano artists \u2014 including local Los Angeles artists like Fabi Reyna and San Cha \u2014 in short films inspired by ASCO\u2019s signature DIY style.",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s a necessary obligation as a Latino if you\u2019re making films to fight very, very hard to put brown people on screen and behind the camera and to try to create films about our history,\u201d said Guti\u00e9rrez Senger. \u201cWe have rich stories, and we have a rich history.\u201d",
      "\u201cASCO: Without Permission\u201d includes testimonials from respected Latino artists, including actor Michael Pe\u00f1a and comedian Arturo Castro, who have broken into the mainstream but know the importance of preserving history.",
      "\u201cOur history as Latinos is not in the history books. The movements that we've had are not in the history books,\u201d Pe\u00f1a says in the documentary.",
      "Although it often feels like progression is slow, Valdez says artists need to continue to voice their opinions and \u201cmisbehave and not ask for permission.\u201d",
      "\u201cYou do not need permission to be yourself. You do not need permission to be creative. You do not need permission to be intellectual,\u201d said Gamboa. \u201cAnd the thing is, you cannot allow yourself to be repressed or silenced and or visually curtailed from presenting works.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "The Supreme Court will hear arguments in a South Carolina case over whether states can cut off Medicaid funding to Planned Parenthood",
      "WASHINGTON -- There are just two Planned Parenthood clinics in South Carolina, but every year they take hundreds of low-income patients who need things like contraception, cancer screenings and pregnancy testing.",
      "The organization has long been at the center of the debate over abortion, but its clinics across the U.S. also provide a range of other services. In South Carolina, Medicaid patients often seek out Planned Parenthood because they often have difficulty finding a doctor who accepts the publicly funded insurance.",
      "A case coming before the Supreme Court from South Carolina on Wednesday could upend that option. That's because the state's Republican governor, Henry McMaster, is pushing to block any public health care dollars from going to Planned Parenthood.",
      "Federal law already prohibits Medicaid money from going to pay for abortions, with very limited exceptions, and South Carolina now bans almost all abortions around six weeks after conception.",
      "\u201cThis case is not about abortion. This case is about general health care,\u201d said Katherine Farris, chief medical officer at Planned Parenthood South Atlantic.",
      "Still, Republican leaders in conservative-led states have long said that no public health care dollars should go to an organization that provides abortions, and states should instead be able to direct that money as they choose. A few states already have cut Medicaid funding to Planned Parenthood and more could follow if South Carolina prevails.",
      "\u201cThe people in this state do not want their tax money to go to that organization,\u201d McMaster said.",
      "The Trump administration is joining South Carolina for the arguments on Wednesday, which are playing out against the backdrop of a wider push by abortion opponents to defund Planned Parenthood.",
      "Health care advocates, meanwhile, say the effects of the case transcend abortion. The legal question at its center is whether Medicaid patients can sue over their legal right to choose their own qualified provider.",
      "The American Cancer Society and other public-health groups say in court papers that lawsuits are the only real way that patients can assert those rights. Losing the ability to go to court would hurt their access to care, especially in rural areas.",
      "\u201cIf no one is able to enforce the statute or no one\u2019s willing to enforce the statute at the federal level, then it\u2019s a right on paper only,\u201d said Julian Polaris, a lawyer who regularly advises state Medicaid programs and health care providers. States could also move to restrict access to treatments like gender-affirming care if the court sides with South Carolina, he said.",
      "One in five American women of reproductive age is now enrolled in the Medicaid program, said Heidi Allen, an associate professor at Columbia University. This means that finding providers who can offer quality family planning services \u2014 a requirement for Medicaid \u2014 is crucial for meeting the needs of those patients.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s concerning that states would eliminate a site of care for politically motivated reasons, \u201cAllen said.",
      "The case stretches back to 2018, before the Supreme Court overturned the nationwide right to abortion, when McMaster first moved to cut Planned Parenthood funding in a fulfillment of a campaign promise. He signed an executive order removing Planned Parenthood from a list of providers for things like birth control, and sexually transmitted disease testing.",
      "\u201cThere are plenty of good organizations that provide maternal health advice, counseling and care and we need more of those,\u201d McMaster said last week.",
      "His order was blocked in court, but since then judges have ruled in favor of similar moves in Texas and Missouri, said John Bursch, an attorney for the conservative group Alliance Defending Freedom.",
      "\u201cAt the highest level, this case is about whether states have the flexibility to direct Medicaid moneys to best benefit low-income women and families,\u201d he said.",
      "He acknowledged that a win for South Carolina could curtail other Medicaid lawsuits, but suggested that could be good for the program overall because it would mean less money going to legal fees. There is also an administrative appeals process available, he said.",
      "\u201cNo one is losing their access to health care clinics,\u201d Busch said. If the state is allowed to cut off Planned Parenthood, Medicaid patients could go to one of 200 other publicly funded health care clinics in the state, he said.",
      "In South Carolina, $90,000 in Medicaid funding goes to Planned Parenthood every year \u2014 a tiny fraction of a percentage point of the state\u2019s total Medicaid spending.",
      "Most counties in the state have already been federally designated as having too few primary care providers, said Amalia Luxardo, CEO of the South Carolina-based Women\u2019s Rights and Empowerment Network. Fourteen of the state\u2019s counties have no practicing OB-GYN physicians and five other counties have just one, she said, meaning many women already have to travel longer distances to find the right provider.",
      "Planned Parenthood has flexible hours and can get appointments scheduled quickly, factors that bring in patients from around the state, she said.",
      "\u201cWe are already in a health care crisis,\u201d said Luxardo, whose group has filed court briefs supporting Planned Parenthood. \u201cAnd when decisions like these negatively impact our constituents, the crisis is going to only increase.\u201d",

The notices came just days after President Donald Trump moved to strip workers of their collective bargaining rights at HHS and other agencies throughout the government.",

      "Two lines with hundreds of employees wrapped around the HHS headquarters building Tuesday morning. Workers waited in the chilly spring weather to be individually scanned in for access to the building. Some said they were waiting to find out if they still had jobs. Others gathered at local coffee shops and lunch spots after being turned away, finding out they had been eliminated after decades of service.",

      "Mexico says a government-sponsored junk food ban in schools has taken effect as the country tries to tackle one of the world\u2019s worst obesity and diabetes epidemics",
      "MEXICO CITY -- A government-sponsored junk food ban in schools across Mexico took effect on Saturday, officials said, as the country tries to tackle one of the world\u2019s worst obesity and diabetes epidemics.",
      "The health guidelines, first published last fall, take a direct shot at salty and sweet processed products that have become a staple for generations of Mexican schoolchildren, such as sugary fruit drinks, packaged chips, artificial pork rinds and soy-encased, chili-flavored peanuts.",
      "Announcing that the ban had become law, Mexico's Education Ministry posted on X: \u201cFarewell, junk food!\u201d It encouraged parents to support the government's crusade by cooking healthy meals for their kids.",
      "\u201cOne of the core principles of the new Mexican school system is healthy living,\" said Mario Delgado, the public health secretary. \u201cThere's a high level of acceptance of this policy among parents.\u201d",
      "Mexico's ambitious attempt to remake its food culture and reprogram the next generation of consumers is being watched closely around the world as governments struggle to turn the tide on a global obesity epidemic.",
      "In the United States, for instance, the Trump administration\u2019s health secretary, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., has vowed to upend the nation's food system and \u201c Make America Healthy Again \" by targeting ultra-processed foods to curb surging obesity and disease.",
      "Under Mexico's new order, schools must phase out any food and beverage displaying even one black warning logo marking it as high in salt, sugar, calories and fat. Mexico implemented that compulsory front-of-package labeling system in 2020.",
      "Enforced from Monday morning, the start of the school week, the junk food ban also requires schools to serve more nutritious alternatives to junk food, like bean tacos, and offer plain drinking water.",
      "\u201cIt is much better to eat a bean taco than a bag of potato chips,\u201d said Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum, who has championed the ban.",
      "Mexico\u2019s children consume more junk food than anywhere else in Latin America, according to UNICEF, which classifies the nation\u2019s childhood obesity epidemic as an emergency. Sugary drinks and highly processed foods account for 40% of the total calories that children consume in a day, the agency reports.",
      "\u201cAt my daughter's school, they told us that future activities wouldn't have candy, it would be completely different, with fruit, vegetables and other food that's healthy for kids,\u201d said Aurora Mart\u00ednez, a mother of two. \u201cIt will help us a lot.\u201d",
      "One-third of Mexican children are already considered overweight or obese, according to government statistics.",
      "School administrators found in violation of the order face stiff fines, ranging from $545 to $5,450.",
      "But enforcement poses a challenge in a country where previous junk food bans have struggled to gain traction and monitoring has been lax across Mexico\u2019s 255,000 schools, many of which lack water fountains \u2014 even reliable internet and electricity.",
      "It also wasn't immediately clear how the government would forbid the sale of junk food on sidewalks outside school campuses, where street vendors typically hawk candy, chips, nachos and ice cream to kids during recess and after the school day ends.",
      "\u201cIt will be difficult,\u201d said Abril Geraldine Rose de Le\u00f3n, a child therapist. \u201cBut it will be achieved in the long run.\u201d",

      "KOFORIDUA, Ghana -- Charles Owusu Aseku has traveled across Ghana and beyond in search of care for the large growth of tissue called a keloid on his neck since 2002. The 46-year-old was growing increasingly frustrated after two unsuccessful surgeries and a trip to South Africa that ended with just a consultation.",

      "The project builds on earlier trials in Scotland and now works as a portable system with enhanced lighting and camera upgrades.",
      "Once inside the van, cameras will capture a 3D model of each patient and the image is then projected onto a large computer screen. Multiple doctors can join the consultation session online and manipulate the 3D model to assess the patient.",
      "\u201cThe idea behind the van is to allow it to travel to those remote villages that don\u2019t have specialized care ... to perform a pre or post-surgical consult,\u201d said Spencer Fowers, principal software developer and 3D-telemedicine project lead at Microsoft Research.",
      "The initiative also gives patients the opportunity to have multiple opinions. Aseku\u2019s session had doctors from Rwanda, Scotland and Brazil, an experience that he said gave him hope.",
      "\"I see a lot of doctors here and I am very happy because experience will come from each of them and maybe they will find a solution to my problem,\u201d the 46-year-old said.",
      "Researchers hope the trial at the Koforidua Regional Hospital, in Ghana\u2019s eastern region, is the start of a wider project that could expand the service and explore new use cases.",
      "Recent years have seen growing use of telemedicine, especially since the COVID-19 pandemic. Experts say such digital tools can benefit patients in Africa the most because there are so few specialist doctors for the continent's 1.4 billion people.",
      "George Opoku, 68, was referred to the Korle-Bu Teaching Hospital in the capital Accra \u2014 nearly 100 kilometers away from the Koforidua hospital, which is much closer to his home \u2014 where he had first gone to seek care for sarcoma, a rare form of cancer that develops in the bones and soft tissues.",
      "Upon hearing about the 3D telemedicine trial, his doctor decided to register him for the process, saving him the extra expenses and stress of long-distance travel.",
      "\u201cThis time I had to sit in a van and to introduce myself and condition to not only one doctor but several of them. I was able to answer all their questions and I am hopeful that they will discuss and cure me of my condition,\u201d Opku said. \u201cI feel well already and I am hopeful.\"",
      "A key challenge for the project is the lack of stable internet access, a common problem in remote parts of Africa.",
      "At the Korle-Bu Teaching Hospital, the technology is helping patients in need of plastic surgery. An inadequate number of plastic surgeons means that patients often have to consult with different doctors during each visit.",
      "Dr. Kwame Darko, consultant plastic surgeon at the hospital and one of the principal investigators on the project, said that 3D telemedicine could give patients the chance to be seen by multiple doctors during one session.",
      "The 3D technology could make a difference if replicated in Ghana and elsewhere, according to Dr. Ahensan Dasebre, chief resident doctor at the National Reconstructive Plastic Surgery and Burns Centre at Korle-Bu, who was not part of the project.",
      "\u201cWe are already behind in terms of how many doctors are available to care for a certain number of the population,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cIf somebody is in a remote part of town where he doesn\u2019t have access to these specialized services, but needs it, the referring doctor could actually use this telemedicine thing to get access to the best of care.\u201d",

      "The parade, held every year on April 1, drew thousands of Assyrians from Iraq and across the diaspora, who marched through Dohuk in northern Iraq waving Assyrian flags and wearing colorful traditional clothes.",
      "Witnesses said the attacker, who has not been officially identified, ran toward the crowd shouting Islamic slogans.",

      "He wears his suits like armor, smiles like a pop star and has more than 2 million followers on TikTok",
      "PARIS -- He wears his suits like armor, smiles like a pop star and boasts more than 2 million followers on TikTok. At just 29, Jordan Bardella has become the fresh-faced figurehead of France\u2019s National Rally party and is now poised to inherit one of the most electorally successful far-right machines in Europe.",
      "But behind the image of youthful confidence lies a question increasingly whispered by allies and adversaries alike: Can Bardella, who has no experience in government, really lead?",
      "The presidential ambitions of Bardella's mentor, Marine Le Pen, are likely over after a French court convicted her of embezzling European Union funds and barred her from holding office for five years. That means Bardella finds himself the last man standing atop the largest party in the French National Assembly. But having the spotlight doesn\u2019t mean he commands the stage.",
      "Critics call him Le Pen\u2019s puppet. Le Pen calls him her asset.",
      "On Monday night, she seemed to suggest the moment of reckoning might be approaching sooner than expected.",
      "\u201cI hope we won\u2019t have to use that asset sooner than necessary,\u201d she told the TF1 television network.",
      "Bardella was born in 1995 in the gritty suburb of Seine-Saint-Denis \u2014 a place more often in headlines for gang violence and poverty than political promise. He grew up in public housing, the son of Italian and Algerian heritage. His father ran a vending machine business. His family scraped together enough to send him to a semi-private Catholic school. He never finished university.",
      "But ambition moved faster than education. At 17, he joined the National Rally \u2014 then still known as the National Front, a party shunned by polite society and defined by the legacy of Jean-Marie Le Pen. For most, it was a dead end. For Bardella, it was a launchpad.",
      "By 23, he was a member of the European Parliament. By 26, Marine Le Pen had made him party president \u2014 the first person outside the Le Pen family to lead the far-right movement in its half-century history. It was a symbolic handover, but also a calculated move to modernize a brand long stained by racism and antisemitism.",
      "\u201cJordan Bardella is the creation of Marine Le Pen,\u201d said C\u00e9cile Alduy, a Stanford University professor and expert on the French far right. \u201cHe has been made by her and is extremely loyal.\u201d",
      "He quickly became the party\u2019s face: camera-ready, uncontroversial and fluent in the aesthetics of modern politics. While Le Pen kept hold of the ideological reins, Bardella toured the country as the youthful ambassador of a rebranded movement.",
      "Their alliance was once pitched as a kind of American-style ticket \u2014 she for president, he for prime minister. But that balance no longer holds. With Le Pen sidelined, Bardella is no longer the backup.",
      "The problem is, he was never meant to lead.",
      "Bardella has never held national office. He\u2019s never run a ministry. But he has built a following. With an outsized social media presence and a slick, stage-managed image, he has become a star among young voters, offering a set of politics that looks fresh, even when the message is familiar.",
      "His content is clean, curated and relentlessly on message. Campaign videos feature sharp suits, barbed quips at President Emmanuel Macron and selfie lines at rally stops. He doesn\u2019t improvise. He doesn\u2019t deviate.",
      "That discipline has helped broaden the National Rally\u2019s appeal, especially in the aftermath of Macron\u2019s defeat in the 2024 European elections. Bardella was the one who demanded Macron dissolve Parliament. When Macron agreed, Bardella\u2019s status shifted from party mascot to potential prime minister.",
      "Yet the more visible he becomes, the more his limitations show.",
      "Last week, Bardella traveled to Israel in a bid to bolster his image on the world stage. It backfired. Major Jewish organizations boycotted the event he attended. Israeli President Isaac Herzog stayed away. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu offered only a brief, formal handshake.",
      "The French press called the visit a reputational flop \u2014 a trip meant to signal international stature that ended up highlighting its absence. Bardella may wear the suit, but many say he hasn\u2019t yet grown into it.",
      "At home, his platform is standard fare for the far right: stricter immigration laws, fewer social benefits for noncitizens and limits on dual nationals holding sensitive public jobs. He\u2019s pledged lower energy taxes, a reversal of Macron\u2019s pension reform and a ban on mobile phones in high schools.",
      "Abroad, he\u2019s attempted to sound more statesmanlike, voicing support for arming Ukraine, labeling Russia a \u201cmultidimensional threat\u201d and calling for France to eventually exit NATO\u2019s integrated command, though not while war rages in Europe.",
      "It\u2019s a program designed to reassure nervous voters while keeping the movement\u2019s nationalist core intact.",
      "\u201cHe has a clean slate and comes with no baggage of the past,\u201d Alduy said.",
      "But the real question isn\u2019t about his past. It\u2019s whether he\u2019s ready for what comes next.",
      "For now, Bardella walks a fine line as the prot\u00e9g\u00e9 who was suddenly promoted, the frontman who's trying to become the act.",
      "His strength lies in presentation. The suit, the smile, the soundbites \u2014 they\u2019re all in place. His weakness is what lies behind that performance. That\u2019s still in question.",
      "The French press has criticized Bardella for failing to prepare his party for real power. National Rally figures have said his leadership has focused more on personal promotion than on collective progress, more about boosting his own image than caring about the party or building a serious governing force.",
      "Others have linked him to a lack of structure and professionalism inside the party. Projects he once promised \u2014 from recruiting outside talent to strengthening local networks \u2014 have stalled. Key voices say the party is too centralized, too top-down and too afraid to challenge its young leader.",
      "Whether Bardella becomes the future of French politics or just its most polished understudy will depend not on Marine Le Pen but on whether he can become more than her invention.",

      "The renewed investigation of a ranch in western Mexico where authorities say the Jalisco New Generation Cartel trained recruits has revealed some details about how one of the country\u2019s most powerful drug cartels operates",
      "MEXICO CITY -- The renewed investigation of a ranch in western Mexico, where authorities say the Jalisco New Generation Cartel trained recruits, has revealed some details about how one of the country\u2019s most powerful drug cartels operates.",
      "The cartel, which the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration says has some 19,000 in its ranks, developed rapidly into an extremely violent and capable force after it split from the Sinaloa cartel following the 2010 killing of Sinaloa cartel capo Ignacio \u201cNacho\u201d Coronel Villarreal by the military.",
      "The Jalisco cartel is led by Nemesio Rub\u00e9n \u201cel Mencho\u201d Oseguera Cervantes, for whom the U.S. government has offered a $15 million reward for information leading to his capture. Oseguera drew renewed attention this week after his image was projected as a band played at a music festival in Jalisco over the weekend.",
      "The Jalisco and Sinaloa cartels have battled for control of various parts of Mexico, including Mexico\u2019s southern border with Guatemala. Both are among six Mexican organized crime groups recently designated as Foreign Terrorist Organizations by the U.S. government.",
      "One of authorities\u2019 recent advances against Jalisco was the arrest of Jos\u00e9 Gregorio Lastra, allegedly in charge of the cartel\u2019s recruitment.",
      "The Jalisco cartel employs three recruiting methods: there are volunteers drawn by the pay and imagined lifestyle, which experts say make up the bulk of their number; there\u2019s targeted recruitment of ex-military and police forces, who because of their professional training enter the cartel as trainers and leaders of squads of gunmen. Finally, there's the kind of forced recruitment that investigators say happened at the Jalisco ranch.",
      "For that last category, authorities say the cartel uses social platforms \u2014 they\u2019ve identified at least 60 pages \u2014 to offer fake job opportunities, especially as security guards, with weekly salaries of $600, well above the average for such positions. Once they have the applicants, they force them to join the cartel.",
      "One recruit who reportedly survived the ranch has said that the cartel picked up recruits at bus stations under false pretenses and took them to the ranch where they were trained for a month in the use of weapons in addition to fitness training, Mexico\u2019s Public Security Secretary Omar Garc\u00eda Harfuch said. Those who refused or tried to escape were beaten, tortured and killed.",
      "Security analyst David Saucedo said Jalisco\u2019s structure is vertical, with Oseguera at the top.",
      "Last weekend, pictures of Oseguera were projected as a band started playing at a regional music festival in Jalisco. Some in the crowd cheered and on Monday President Claudia Sheinbaum, as well as Jalisco's governor, condemned the act. The Jalisco State Prosecutor's Office said it was opening an investigation. Such displays of respect for cartel leaders are not uncommon.",
      "Below Oseguera are regional commands, as well as areas responsible for drug production and sales, Saucedo said.",
      "The DEA says the cartel has a presence in 21 of Mexico\u2019s 32 states, exceeding the Sinaloa cartel\u2019s 19. Some analysts believe Jalisco is actually in as many as 25 states, including its home base in the state of the same name. It also maintains a presence in some 100 countries, according to the DEA.",
      "In less than two decades, Jalisco became one of Mexico\u2019s most powerful criminal organizations and even managed to take control of some traditional strongholds of the Sinaloa cartel. Sinaloa has been weakened more recently by infighting among its factions following arrests of key leaders, including Joaqu\u00edn \u201cEl Chapo\u201d Guzm\u00e1n, who is serving a life sentence in the U.S., and Ismael \u201cEl Mayo\u201d Zambada, who was arrested last July along with one of Guzm\u00e1n\u2019s sons and is awaiting trial in the U.S.",
      "Center for Research and Higher Studies in Social Anthropology researcher Carlos Flores said Jalisco\u2019s \u201ccapacity for violent action\u201d and style of \u201cirregular warfare\u201d aided its speedy rise, which coincided with the emergence of fentanyl as a highly profitable revenue stream.",
      "Saucedo says that Jalisco has also successfully allied itself with other criminal groups, allowing it to penetrate some territories with a sort of \u201cfranchise\u201d model as in the central state of Aguascalientes and the key border city of Tijuana.",
      "The case of the ranch also serves as an example of how the Jalisco cartel is able to operate with impunity in territory it controls thanks to the complicity of local authorities, Flores said.",
      "Despite being discovered in September 2024 and 10 people being arrested, the ranch\u2019s investigation stalled until family members searching for their relatives went there themselves in March and raised the alarm about hundreds of clothing items they found, as well as apparent bone fragments. Since then, authorities have detained three local police officers who were allegedly tied to disappearances at the ranch.",
      "\u201cThere are signs that show publicly how those kinds of deals have allowed the Jalisco cartel to establish itself in certain states, while they go about eliminating their rivals, sometimes with the help of public safety forces,\u201d Flores said.",

      "A Jesuit priest says he will rather go to prison than pay a fine of 500 euros or $541 for participating in a climate activists\u2019 street blockade in the southern German city of Nuremberg",
      "BERLIN -- BERLIN (AP) \u2014 A Jesuit priest says he prefers going to prison than paying a 500-euro ($541) fine for participating in a climate activists' street blockade in the southern German city of Nuremberg.",
      "The Rev. J\u00f6rg Alt started serving his nearly monthlong prison sentence on Tuesday in Nuremberg.",
      "\u201cToday, I am starting my 25-day alternative custodial sentence in Nuremberg prison,\u201d he said before entering the prison. \u201cI don\u2019t like doing this, especially as my health is no longer the best at the age of 63. But I see no alternative, because it\u2019s the last form of protest I have left in this specific case to draw attention to important issues\u201d such as climate change.",
      "In November, Alt said that \"as a priest, I have no income and no bank account due to my vow of poverty and that I do not want to harm the order and my fellow brothers by paying my fine,\u201d German news agency dpa reported.",
      "His remarks came after a Bavarian Higher Regional Court rejected his appeal to a lower court's decision and confirmed Alt's conviction for coercion for participating in a sit-in blockade.",
      "After the court's decision, authorities repeatedly asked Alt to pay the 500 euros, before the fine was eventually commuted to the 25-day prison sentence.",
      "The court ruling in November was in connection with a street blockade in August 2022, when the Jesuit priest and about 40 other activists blocked traffic in Nuremberg by gluing their hands to a street in front of the city's train station to draw attention to climate change.",
      "Numerous similar protests have taken place across Germany and other countries in recent years, as activists try to draw attention to the urgency of tackling climate change. The public and political response to such road blockades has been mixed.",
      "While some Germans have said they support the protesters\u2019 cause, if not their means, activists have also faced violence from enraged motorists and calls for tough punishment from conservative politicians.",
      "German Chancellor Olaf Scholz has sharply criticized climate activists as \u201c nutty\u201d for drastic protests such as blocking streets or gluing themselves to famous paintings in museums.",
      "Last year, activists belonging to one of the main protest groups, the Last Generation, announced that they would abandon the tactic and move on to holding what they call \u201cdisobedient assemblies.\u201d",
      "Alt has said that he had also decided to serve the prison sentence instead of paying the fine \"in solidarity with those climate activists who are treated similarly by the administration and the judiciary \u2014 it may all be lawful, but it is unjust.\u201d",
      "It's not the first time, that Alt was convicted for his activism. In May 2023, a court also convicted him of coercion after he participated in a road blockade in Munich and ordered him to pay a small fine.",

      "GENEVA -- Scientists at the world's largest atom smasher have released a blueprint for a much bigger successor that could help solve remaining enigmas of physics.",
      "The plans for the Future Circular Collider \u2014 a nearly 91-kilometer (56.5-mile) loop along the French-Swiss border and even below Lake Geneva \u2014 published late on Monday put the finishing details on a project roughly a decade in the making at CERN, the European Organization for Nuclear Research.",
      "The study lays out features like the proposed path, environmental impact, scientific ambitions and cost of the project. Independent experts will take a look before CERN's two-dozen member countries \u2014 all European except for Israel \u2014 decide in 2028 whether to go forward, starting in the mid-2040s at a cost of some 14 billion Swiss francs (about $16 billion).",
      "CERN officials have touted the promise of scientific discoveries that could drive innovation in areas like cryogenics, superconducting magnets and vacuum technologies that could benefit humankind. Outside experts pointed to the promise of learning more about the Higgs boson, the elusive particle that helped explain how matter formed after the Big Bang",
      "\u201cThis set of reports represents an important milestone in the process, but a full sense of the likelihood of it being brought to fruition will only be known through careful studies by scientists, engineers and others, including politicians who must make difficult decisions at time when uncertainty rules the day,\u201d said Dave Toback, a professor of physics and astronomy at Texas A&M University, in an e-mail.",
      "The new collider \u201cprovides and exciting opportunity for the particle physics community, and indeed all of physics, on the world stage,\u201d said Toback, who was not affiliated with the study, and who worked for years at the Fermilab Tevatron collider in the United States that was shut down in 2011.",
      "For roughly a decade, top minds at CERN have been cooking up plans for a successor to the Large Hadron Collider, a network of magnets that accelerate particles through a 27-kilometer (17-mile) underground tunnel and slams them together at velocities approaching the speed of light.",
      "Work at the particle collider confirmed in 2013 the existence of the Higgs boson \u2014 the central piece in a puzzle known as the standard model that helps explains some fundamental forces in the universe.",
      "CERN scientists, engineers and partners behind the study considered at least 100 different scenarios for the new collider before coming up with the proposed 91-kilometer circumference at an average depth of 200 meters (656 feet). The tunnel would be about 5 meters (16 feet) in diameter, CERN said.",
      "\u201cUltimately what we would like to do is a collider which will come up with ten times more energy than what we have today,\" said Arnaud Marsollier, a CERN spokesman. \u201cWhen you have more energy, then you can create particles that are heavier.\u201d",
      "A bigger collider would also offer greater precision to help plumb particularities of the Higgs boson, which \u201cwe have kind of a blurry image of\u201d now, he added.",

      "BANGKOK -- Rescue workers saved a 63-year-old woman from the rubble of a building in Myanmar's capital on Tuesday, but hope was fading of finding many more survivors of the violent earthquake that killed more than 2,700 people, compounding a humanitarian crisis caused by a civil war.",
      "The fire department in Naypyitaw said the woman was successfully pulled from the rubble 91 hours after being buried when the building collapsed in the 7.7 magnitude earthquake that hit midday Friday. Experts say the likelihood of finding survivors drops dramatically after 72 hours.",
      "The head of Myanmar\u2019s military government, Senior Gen. Min Aung Hlaing, told a forum for relief donations in Naypyitaw that 2,719 people have now been found dead, with 4,521 others injured and 441 missing, Myanmar's state MRTV television reported.",
      "He said Friday\u2019s earthquake was the second most powerful in the country's recorded history after a magnitude 8 quake east of Mandalay in May 1912.",

      "Myanmar's fire department said 403 people have been rescued in Mandalay and 259 bodies have been found so far. In one incident, 50 Buddhist monks who were taking a religious exam in a monastery were killed when the building collapsed, and 150 more are thought to be buried in the rubble.",
      "The World Health Organization said more than 10,000 buildings overall are known to have collapsed or been severely damaged by the quake.",
      "The earthquake also rocked neighboring Thailand, causing a high-rise building under construction to collapse and burying many workers.",
      "Two bodies were pulled from the rubble Monday and another was recovered Tuesday, but dozens were still missing. Overall, there were 22 people killed and 34 injured in Bangkok, primarily at the construction site.",
      "In Myanmar, search and rescue efforts across the affected area paused briefly at midday Tuesday as people stood for a minute in silent tribute to the dead.",
      "Foreign aid workers have been arriving slowly to help in the rescue efforts, but progress lagged due to a lack of heavy machinery in many places.",
      "In one site in Naypyitaw on Tuesday, workers formed a human chain, passing chunks of brick and concrete out hand-by-hand from the ruins of a collapsed building.",

      "A U.S. official said the three-person team had waited for visas before making the trip from neighboring Thailand following a weekend decision to provide $2 million in emergency assistance to Myanmar. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because the team\u2019s arrival has not yet been publicly announced.",

      "Even before the earthquake, more than 3 million people had been displaced from their homes by Myanmar's brutal civil war, and nearly 20 million were in need, according to the U.N.",
      "Many were already lacking in basic medical care and standard vaccinations, and the destruction of water and sanitation infrastructure by the earthquake and the movement of people into overcrowded shelters raises the risk of disease outbreaks, warned the U.N.'s Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs.",

      "Shelter is also a major problem, especially with the monsoon season looming.",
      "Since the earthquake, many people have been sleeping outside, either because homes were destroyed or out of fear of aftershocks.",
      "Myanmar's military seized power in 2021 from the democratically elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi, sparking what has turned into significant armed resistance and a brutal civil war.",
      "Government forces have lost control of much of Myanmar, and many places were dangerous or impossible for aid groups to reach even before the quake.",
      "Military attacks and those from some anti-military groups have not stopped in the aftermath of the earthquake, though the shadow opposition National Unity Government has called a unilateral ceasefire for its forces.",
      "The NUG, established by elected lawmakers who were ousted in 2021, called for the international community to ensure humanitarian aid is delivered directly to the earthquake victims, urging \u201cvigilance against any attempts by the military junta to divert or obstruct humanitarian assistance,\" saying that could have \u201cdevastating consequences.\u201d",
      "The ceasefire plan for the armed wing of the NUG, called the People's Defense Force, would have little effect on the battlefield, but could draw more international condemnation of continuing operations by the military, including air attacks reported by independent media.",
      "A second armed opposition group, a coalition of three powerful ethnic minority guerrilla armies called the Three Brotherhood Alliance, announced Tuesday that it would also implement a monthlong unilateral ceasefire.",
      "Before the announcement, Min Aung Hlaing earler seemed to reject implementing a ceasefire, saying in his speech on Tuesday that the military will continue to take necessary defensive measures against some ethnic armed groups that were currently not carrying out combat operations, but were conducting military training, which he said amounted to hostile action.",
      "It wasn't immediately clear whether the military has been impeding humanitarian aid. In the past, it initially refused to allow in foreign rescue teams or many emergency supplies after Cyclone Nargis in 2008, which resulted in well more than 100,000 deaths. Even once it did allow foreign assistance, it was with severe restrictions.",
      "In this case, however, Min Aung Hlaing pointedly said on the day of the earthquake that the country would accept outside help.",
      "Tom Andrews, a monitor on rights in Myanmar commissioned by the U.N.-backed Human Rights Council, said on X that to facilitate aid, military attacks must stop.",

      "The court has been deliberating Yoon\u2019s political fate after he was impeached in December over his brief imposition of martial law that has triggered a massive political crisis.",
      "Millions of people have rallied around the country to support or denounce Yoon. Police said they\u2019ll mobilize all available personnel to preserve order and respond to acts of vandalism, arson and assault.",

      "The opposition-controlled liberal National Assembly voted to impeach Yoon soon after he imposed martial law Dec. 3. In addition to the Constitutional Court's ruling on his impeachment, Yoon was indicted in January on criminal rebellion charges.",
      "If the Constitutional Court removes Yoon from office, South Korea must hold an election within two months for a new president. If the court overturns his impeachment, Yoon would immediately return to his presidential duties.",
      "At the heart of the matter is Yoon\u2019s decision to send hundreds of troops and police officers to the National Assembly after imposing martial law. Yoon has insisted that he aimed to maintain order, but some military and military officials testified Yoon ordered them to drag out lawmakers to frustrate a floor vote on his decree and detain his political opponents.",
      "Yoon argues that he didn\u2019t intend to maintain martial law for long, and he only wanted to highlight what he called the \u201cwickedness\u201d of the main liberal opposition Democratic Party, which obstructed his agenda, impeached senior officials and slashed his budget bill. During his martial law announcement, he called the assembly \u201ca den of criminals\u201d and \u201canti-state forces.\u201d",
      "By law, a president has the right to declare martial law in wartime or other emergency situations, but the Democratic Party and its supporters say South Korea wasn\u2019t in such a situation.",
      "The impeachment motion accused Yoon of suppressing National Assembly activities, attempting to detain politicians and others and undermining peace in violation of the constitution and other laws. Yoon has said he had no intention of disrupting National Assembly operations and detaining anyone.",
      "Martial law lasted only six hours because lawmakers managed to enter the assembly and vote to strike down his decree unanimously. No violence erupted, but live TV footage showing armed soldiers arriving at the assembly invoked painful memories of past military-backed dictatorships. It was the first time for South Korea to be placed under martial law since 1980.",
      "Earlier public surveys showed a majority of South Koreans supported Yoon\u2019s impeachment. But after his impeachment, pro-Yoon rallies have grown sharply, with many conservatives fed up with what they call the Democratic Party\u2019s excessive offensive on the already embattled Yoon administration.",
      "Yoon was released from prison March 8, after a Seoul district court cancelled his arrest and allowed him to stand his criminal trial without being detained. Ten top military and police officials have also been arrested and indicted over their roles in the martial law enactment.",

      "In one of her sharpest political maneuvers, she sought out a group long despised by her father: the LGBTQ community. Le Pen filled her inner circle with openly gay aides, skipped public protests against same-sex marriage and framed herself as a protector of sexual minorities against \u201cIslamist danger.\u201d",
      "Critics called it \u201cpinkwashing\u201d \u2014 a cosmetic tolerance masking deeper hostility. But it worked. A surprising number of gay voters, especially younger ones, started backing her. Many saw strength, clarity and the promise of order in a world spinning too fast.",
      "She ran for president three times: 2012, 2017 and 2022. Each time, she climbed higher. In her final campaign, she was confident, calm and media savvy. She leaned into her role as a single mother, posed with her cats and repeated her calls for \u201cnational priority.\u201d She no longer shocked. She convinced.",
      "Behind her stood a constellation of far-right leaders cheering her on: Hungary\u2019s Viktor Orb\u00e1n, Matteo Salvini and Giorgia Meloni in Italy, the Netherlands\u2019 Geert Wilders. They saw in her not only an ally, but a leader. Her mix of cultural nationalism, social media fluency and calculated restraint became a blueprint.",
      "\u201cMarine Le Pen posts pictures of her cat, talks about being a mother. But when it comes to policy, there\u2019s no softening,\u201d said Pierre Lefevre, a Paris-based consultant. \u201cIt makes extreme positions seem more palatable, even to people who might otherwise be put off.\u201d",
      "When Le Pen lost in 2022, she didn\u2019t vanish. She regrouped, stayed present in parliament and prepared for 2027. Polls had her leading. Macron cannot run again.",
      "Then came Monday's verdict.",
      "The court found that Le Pen had siphoned off millions of euros in public funds while serving in the European Parliament, paying party staff with money intended for EU assistants. Prosecutors described it as deliberate and organized. The court agreed.",
      "She was sentenced to two years of house arrest, fined \u20ac100,000 ($108,200) and banned from holding public office for five years. She said she would appeal. The house arrest sentence will be suspended during the appeal, but the ban on holding office takes effect immediately.",
      "Her allies erupted in outrage. Orb\u00e1n declared, \u201cJe suis Marine\u201d \u2014 I am Marine. Salvini called the ruling \u201ca declaration of war by Brussels.\u201d Meloni lamented it was \u201cdepriving millions of citizens of their representation.\u201d U.S. President Donald Trump decried it as \"a very big deal... it sounds like this country.\u201d In Paris, her supporters called it political persecution. Her opponents fist-pumped in the streets.",
      "Even in disgrace, Le Pen remains one of the most consequential political figures of her time. She took a name that once evoked hatred and transformed it into a serious vehicle for national leadership. She made the far right electable. She blurred the line between fringe and power.",
      "Her party, the National Rally, became the largest last year in France\u2019s lower house of parliament. Her handpicked successor, 29-year-old Jordan Bardella, now leads it. He is polished and popular, but he lacks broad political experience and name recognition.",
      "Whether Le Pen returns after her ban, fades into silence or reinvents herself again, her mark is permanent. She forced mainstream rivals to adapt to her language. She turned fear into votes and redefined what was politically possible in a republic once seen as immune to extremism.",
      "She never became president, but she changed the race and the rules.",

      "BEIRUT -- A 12-year-old boy was among four people killed on Monday in Syria \u2019s Tartous province, a coastal region home to a majority Alawite population, provincial officials said in a statement.",

The Tartous province\u2019s general security forces are pursuing those involved \u201cto bring them to justice,\u201d said Amer al-Madani, Baniyas\u2019 head of security, who spoke in a video posted on the province\u2019s official Facebook page.",
      "Kamal, a resident of a nearby village and a relative of three victims who asked to be identified only by his first name out of fear of reprisals, said the masked gunmen, whom he believed to be government security forces, arrived at the village seeking the mukhtar, a local leader who represents the community in administrative matters, before opening fire, killing at least four people, including a 12-year-old and an 80-year-old from the same family.",
      "Kamal said he was citing accounts from three other witnesses. The sequence of events has not been independently verified, and there is no official statement on the details of the attack.",
      "Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) is the Islamist group whose leader, Ahmad al-Sharaa, played a key role in the overthrow of former President Bashar al-Assad and is now Syria\u2019s de facto president.",
      "The attack forced dozens of families to flee from the Baniyas area, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a British-based war monitor. Kamal also said many in Baniyas escaped to nearby mountains. \u201cNo one here feels safe,\u201d he said. \u201cAll main roads are empty most times because people are scared to go outside.\u201d",
      "Separately on Monday, two unidentified gunmen killed six people in Homs, a city in western Syria known for its religious diversity, with a majority of Sunni Muslims and a significant Alawite minority, a sect of Shia Islam primarily based in Syria.",
      "The attack took place in the Karm al-Zeitoun neighborhood, claiming the lives of three children and their mother, who all belonged to the Alawite sect, as well as two house guests from the Sunni community. The attack also left the father seriously wounded. There has been no official comment on the incident from the government or relevant authorities.",
      "Syria\u2019s Alawite community in Syria has faced escalating violence, with reports of massacres and targeted attacks.",
      "In early March, Islamist-led forces killed over 1,000 Alawites in coordinated assaults on coastal areas including Latakia and Baniyas, carrying out executions and burning homes, leading to mass displacements.",
      "The attacks, among the deadliest in Syria\u2019s modern history, saw militants rampage through Alawite-populated coastal provinces and nearby Hama and Homs, killing civilians\u2014including entire families\u2014in homes and on the streets. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported nearly 200 deaths in Baniyas alone.",
      "Witnesses identified the attackers as hardline Sunni Islamists, including Syria-based jihadi foreign fighters and former members of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, the disbanded insurgent group that led the December Assad ousting. However, many were also local Sunnis, seeking revenge for past atrocities blamed on Alawites loyal to Assad.",
      "While some Sunnis hold the Alawite community responsible for Assad\u2019s brutal crackdowns, Alawites themselves say they also suffered under his rule. The international community has urged Syria\u2019s new government to protect minorities and prevent further violence.",

      "Lehder became the first Colombian drug trafficker extradited to the United States after he was arrested during a party at his ranch.",
      "The former drug trafficker was extradited to the U.S. in 1987, where he served more than 30 years in prison. In 2020, Lehder was released after serving two-thirds of his U.S. sentence. He was deported to Germany, where he is also a citizen.",
      "Lehder had not returned to Colombia since his extradition to the United States. His lawyer, Sondra Macollins said he was attempting to visit relatives when he arrived Friday.",
      "\u201cHe is recovering from cancer, and has high blood pressure problems,\u201d Macollins told Colombia\u2019s Blu radio. \u201cWe are talking about someone who spent years in dark cells.\u201d",

      "The son of a German immigrant who arrived in Colombia in the 1920s, Lehder began his criminal career in the 1970s when he lived with relatives in New York City.",

However, Western officials believe Iran runs intelligence operations in the UAE and keeps tabs on the hundreds of thousands of Iranians living across the country.",

      "President Donald Trump is set to launch a barrage of so-called reciprocal tariffs on friend and foe alike",
      "WASHINGTON -- After weeks of White House hype and public anxiety, President Donald Trump is set Wednesday to announce a barrage of self-described \u201creciprocal\u201d tariffs on friend and foe alike.",
      "The new tariffs \u2014 coming on what Trump has called \u201cLiberation Day\u201d \u2014 is a bid to boost U.S. manufacturing and punish other countries for what he has said are years of unfair trade practices. But by most economists\u2019 assessments, the risky move threatens to plunge the economy into a downturn and mangle decades-old alliances.",
      "The White House is exuding confidence despite the political and financial gamble being undertaken.",
      "\u201cApril 2, 2025, will go down as one of the most important days in modern American history,\u201d White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said at Tuesday\u2019s briefing while adding that the new tariffs will take effect immediately.",
      "The reciprocal tariffs Trump plans to announce follow similar recent announcements of 25% taxes on auto imports; levies against China, Canada and Mexico; and expanded tariffs on steel and aluminum. Trump has also put tariffs against countries that import oil from Venezuela and plans separate import taxes on pharmaceutical drugs, lumber, copper and computer chips.",
      "None of the warning signs about a falling stock market or consumer sentiment turning morose have caused the administration to publicly second-guess its strategy.",
      "White House trade adviser Peter Navarro has suggested that the new tariffs would raise $600 billion annually, which would be the largest tax increase since World War II. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told lawmakers that the tariffs would be capped and could be negotiated downward by other countries, according to the office of Rep. Kevin Hern, R-Okla. But the White House has yet to confirm policy details, despite Trump saying on Monday that he had made his decision.",
      "Importers would likely pass along some of the cost of the taxes on to consumers. The Budget Lab at Yale University estimates that a 20% universal tariff would cost the average household an additional $3,400 to $4,200.",
      "The administration's premise is that manufacturers will quickly increase domestic production and create new factory jobs \u2014 and the White House is expressing confidence that Trump\u2019s approach is absolutely correct.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re not going to be wrong,\u201d Leavitt said. \u201cIt is going to work. And the president has a brilliant team of advisers who have been studying these issues for decades. And we are focused on restoring the golden age of America and making America a manufacturing superpower.\u201d",
      "The bold optimism has done little to reassure the public or allies who see the import taxes as a threat.",
      "Based on the possibility of broad 20% tariffs that have been floated by some White House aides, most analyses see an economy tarnished by higher prices and stagnation. U.S. economic growth \u2014 as measured by gross domestic product \u2014 would be roughly a percentage point lower, and clothing, oil, automobiles, housing, groceries and even insurance would cost more, the Budget Lab analysis found.",
      "Trump would single-handedly be applying these tariffs, since he has ways of legally doing so without congressional approval. That makes it easy for Democratic lawmakers and policymakers to criticize the Republican administration, if the uncertainty expressed by businesses and declining consumer sentiment are, in fact, signs of trouble to come.",
      "Heather Boushey, who served as a member of the Biden White House's Council of Economic Advisers, noted that the less aggressive tariffs Trump imposed during his first term failed to stir the manufacturing renaissance he promised voters.",
      "\u201cWe are not seeing indications of the boom that the president promised,\" Boushey said. \u201cIt's a failed strategy.\u201d",
      "Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York said the tariffs were fundamentally a way for Trump to raise revenues in order to pay for his planned extensions of income tax cuts that disproportionately favor millionaires and billionaires.",
      "\u201cAlmost everything they do, including tariffs, it seems to me, is aimed at getting those tax cuts for the wealthy,\u201d Schumer said Tuesday on the Senate floor.",
      "Even Republicans who trust Trump's instincts have acknowledged that the tariffs could be disruptive to an economy with an otherwise healthy 4.1 % unemployment rate.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ll see how it all develops,\u201d said House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La. \u201cIt may be rocky in the beginning. But I think that this will make sense for Americans and help all Americans.\u201d",
      "Longtime trading partners are preparing their own countermeasures. Canada has already imposed some in response to the 25% tariffs that Trump tied to the trafficking of fentanyl. The European Union, in response to the steel and aluminum tariffs, put taxes on 26 billion euros' worth ($28 billion) of U.S. goods, including on bourbon, which prompted Trump to threaten a 200% tariff on European alcohol.",
      "Many allies feel they have been reluctantly drawn into a confrontation by Trump, who routinely says that friends and foes have essentially ripped off the United States with a mix of tariffs and other trade barriers.",
      "The flip side, of course, is that Americans also have the incomes to choose to buy designer gowns by French fashion houses and autos from German manufacturers, whereas World Bank data show the EU has lower incomes per capita than the United States.",
      "\u201cEurope has not started this confrontation,\u201d said European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. \u201cWe do not necessarily want to retaliate but, if it is necessary, we have a strong plan to retaliate and we will use it.\u201d",
      "Because Trump has hyped his tariffs without providing specifics, he has provided a deeper sense of uncertainty for the world, a sign that the economic slowdown could possibly extend beyond U.S. borders to other nations that would see one person to blame.",
      "Ray Sparnaay, general manager of JE Fixture & Tool, a Canadian tool and die business that sits across the Detroit River, said the uncertainty has crushed his company's ability to make plans.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s going to be tariffs implemented. We just don\u2019t know at this point,\u201d he said Monday. \u201cThat\u2019s one of the biggest problems we\u2019ve had probably the last \u2014 well, since November \u2014 is the uncertainty. It\u2019s basically slowed all of our quoting processes, business that we hope to secure has been stalled.\u201d",

Trump has pushed for tariffs in part to bring manufacturing jobs back to the United States from other countries.",

      "Suspected U.S. airstrikes have battered rebel-controlled areas of Yemen, with the Houthis saying one strike killed at least four people near the Red Sea port city of Hodeida",
      "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- Suspected U.S. airstrikes battered rebel-controlled areas of Yemen into Wednesday, with the Houthis saying one strike killed at least four people near the Red Sea port city of Hodeida.",
      "The intense campaign of airstrikes under President Donald Trump, targeting the rebels over their attacks on shipping in Mideast waters stemming from the Israel-Hamas war, has killed at least 65 people, according to casualty figures released by the Houthis.",
      "The campaign appears to show no signs of stopping as the Trump administration again linked their airstrikes on the Iranian-backed Houthis to an effort to pressure Iran over its rapidly advancing nuclear program. While so far giving no specifics about the campaign and its targets, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt put the overall number of strikes on Tuesday at over 200.",
      "\u201cIran is incredibly weakened as a result of these attacks and we have seen they have taken out Houthi leaders,\u201d Leavitt said. \u201cThey\u2019ve taken out critical members who were launching strikes on naval ships and on commercial vessels and this operation will not stop until the freedom of navigation in this region is restored.\u201d",
      "The Houthis have not acknowledged the loss of any of its leadership so far \u2014 and the U.S. has not identified any official by name. However, messages released by the leak of a Signal conversation between Trump administration officials and their public comments suggest a leader in the rebels' missile forces had been targeted.",
      "Overnight, a likely U.S. airstrike targeted what the Houthis described as a \u201cwater project\u201d in Hodeida governorate's Mansuriyah District, killing four people and wounding others. Other strikes into Wednesday targeted Hajjah, Saada and Sanaa governorates, the rebels said.",
      "The rebels say they've continued to launch attacks against U.S. warships in the Red Sea, namely the aircraft carrier USS Harry S. Truman, which is launching the majority of the strikes on the Houthis. No warship has been struck yet, but the U.S. Navy has described the Houthi fire as the most intense combat its sailors have faced since World War II.",
      "The aircraft carrier USS Carl Vinson, now in Asia, is on its way to the Mideast to back up the Truman. Early Wednesday, Pentagon spokesperson Sean Parnell said \u201cadditional squadrons and other air assets\" would be deployed to the region, without elaborating.",
      "That likely includes the deployment of nuclear-capable B-2 bombers to Camp Thunder Bay on Diego Garcia in the Indian Ocean. Satellite photos taken Tuesday by Planet Labs PBC analyzed by The Associated Press showed at least six B-2s at the base \u2014 nearly a third of all the bombers in America's arsenal.",
      "The U.S. has used the B-2 in Yemen in the past to attack underground Houthi bases. The B-2 likely would need to be used if America ever tried to target Iran's underground nuclear sites as well.",
      "The Houthis on Tuesday claimed shooting down another American MQ-9 drone over the country.",
      "An Associated Press review has found the new American operation against the Houthis under Trump appears more extensive than those under former President Joe Biden, as the U.S. moves from solely targeting launch sites to firing at ranking personnel and dropping bombs on cities.",
      "The new campaign of airstrikes started after the rebels threatened to begin targeting \u201cIsraeli\u201d ships again over Israel blocking aid entering the Gaza Strip. The rebels have loosely defined what constitutes an Israeli ship, meaning many vessels could be targeted.",
      "The Houthis targeted over 100 merchant vessels with missiles and drones, sinking two vessels and killing four sailors from November 2023 until January of this year. They also launched attacks targeting American warships, though none has been hit.",
      "The attacks greatly raised the Houthis\u2019 profile as they faced economic problems and launched a crackdown targeting dissent and aid workers at home amid Yemen\u2019s decadelong stalemated war, which has torn apart the Arab world\u2019s poorest nation.",

      "Anger over the Trump administration\u2019s tariffs and rhetoric will likely cause international travel to the U.S. to fall even further than expected this year, an influential travel forecasting company said Tuesday.",
      "Tourism Economics said it expects the number of people arriving in the U.S. from abroad to decline by 9.4% this year. That\u2019s almost twice the 5% drop the company forecast at the end of February.",
      "At the beginning of the year, Tourism Economics predicted a booming year for international travel to the U.S., with visits up 9% from 2024.",
      "But Tourism Economics President Adam Sacks said high-profile lockups of European tourists at the U.S. border in recent weeks have chilled international travelers. Potential visitors have also been angered by tariffs, Trump's stance toward Canada and Greenland, and his heated White House exchange with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.",
      "\u201cWith each policy development, each rhetorical missive, we\u2019re just seeing unforced error after unforced error in the administration,\u201d Sacks said. \u201cIt has a direct impact on international travel to the U.S.\u201d",
      "The decline will have consequences for airlines, hotels, national parks and other sites frequented by tourists.",
      "Tourism Economics expects travel from Canada to plummet 20% this year, a decline that will be acutely felt in border states like New York and Michigan but also popular tourist destinations like California, Nevada and Florida.",
      "The U.S. Travel Association, a trade group, has also warned about Canadians staying away. Even a 10% reduction in travel from Canada could mean 2.0 million fewer visits, $2.1 billion in lost spending and 14,000 job losses, the group said in February.",
      "Other travel-related companies have noted worrying signs. At its annual shareholder meeting on Monday, Air Canada said bookings to the U.S. were down 10% for the April-September period compared to the same period a year ago.",
      "Sacks said he now expects foreign visitors to spend $9 billion less in the U.S. compared to 2024, when international tourism to the country rose 9.1%.",
      "\u201cThe irony is that the tariffs are being put in place to help right the trade deficit, but they're harming the trade balance by causing fewer international travelers to come and spend money here,\u201d Sacks said.",
      "Sacks said international arrivals had been getting close to returning to 2019 numbers, before the coronavirus pandemic halted most travel. Now he thinks they won't get back to that level until 2029.",

      "The Food and Drug Administration\u2019s chief tobacco regulator has been forced out",
      "WASHINGTON -- The Food and Drug Administration\u2019s chief tobacco regulator has been removed from his post amid sweeping cuts at the agency and across the federal health workforce handed down Tuesday, according to people familiar with the matter.",
      "In an email to staff, FDA tobacco director Brian King said: \u201cIt is with a heavy heart and profound disappointment that I share I have been placed on administrative leave.\u201d",
      "King was removed from his position and offered reassignment to the Indian Health Service, according to a person familiar with the matter who did not have permission to discuss the matter publicly and spoke on the condition of anonymity.",
      "Dozens of staffers in FDA\u2019s tobacco center also received notices of dismissal Tuesday morning, including the entire office responsible for enforcing tobacco regulations.",
      "King, who joined the agency in 2022, has been vigorously criticized by vaping lobbyists for ordering thousands of companies to remove their fruit and candy-flavored e-cigarettes from the market. During his time at FDA, teen vaping has fallen to a 10-year low.",
      "His removal comes just days after FDA vaccine chief Dr. Peter Marks was forced out, citing health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s support for vaccine \u201cmisinformation and lies\u201d in his resignation letter.",
      "The latest changes mean that nearly all of FDA\u2019s top leaders overseeing drugs, food, vaccines, medical devices and now tobacco products have resigned or retired in recent months.",
      "The leadership vacuum comes as Kennedy moves to fire 3,500 FDA staffers and pushes ahead with plans to scrutinize ultra-processed foods, childhood vaccines, antidepressants and other long-established products.",
      "The wave of departures means incoming FDA commissioner Marty Makary \u2014 who was confirmed last week\u2014 will inherit an agency without many of its top experts and a beleaguered workforce that has been rocked by weeks of layoffs and a chaotic return-to-office process. Only a handful of FDA employees are political appointees, with nearly all of the agency's scientific reviews and decisions overseen by career officials.",

      "Politicians, parents and anti-tobacco groups want the FDA to do more to stamp out unauthorized vaping products that can appeal to teens, many of which are imported from China. Tobacco and vaping companies say the FDA has been too slow to approve newer products for adult smokers \u2014 including e-cigarettes \u2014 that generally carry much lower risks than traditional cigarettes.",
      "Under King, the FDA rejected applications for millions of flavored e-cigarettes, citing insufficient data that the products would help adult smokers while not becoming popular with underage kids. Those rejections have resulted in multiple lawsuits against FDA from vape makers, including one that was argued before the Supreme Court in December.",
      "The Vapor Technology Association, an industry group, has been running ads urging Trump to follow through on a campaign pledge he made to \u201csave the flavored vaping industry.\u201d",

      "A federal judge has declined to block the use of Georgia\u2019s electronic voting system in a long-running lawsuit that alleged that the system is vulnerable to attack and has operational issues that could deprive voters of their constitutional rights",
      "ATLANTA -- A federal judge has declined to block the use of Georgia's electronic voting system in a long-running lawsuit that alleged that the system is vulnerable to attack and has operational issues that could deprive voters of their constitutional rights.",
      "U.S. District Judge Amy Totenberg found that the activists and individual voters who challenged the state's voting system did not prove that the problems they identified prevented them from voting, diluted their votes or kept their votes from being counted. She wrote in a ruling Monday that they lack standing to sue and she is unable to consider the merits of their claims.",
      "Georgia election officials have consistently said the system is secure and reliable and that it is up to the state to decide how it conducts elections.",
      "The ruling follows several years of intense focus on Georgia's elections in the aftermath of President Donald Trump's narrow loss in the state to Democrat Joe Biden in the 2020 presidential election. Trump claimed without evidence that election fraud cost him victory, and his allies spread wild conspiracy theories about the Dominion Voting Systems machines used in Georgia.",
      "But the lawsuit at issue long precedes those claims. It was originally filed in 2017 by several individual voters and the Coalition for Good Governance, which advocates for election integrity, and targeted the outdated, paperless voting system used at the time. After Georgia purchased a new voting system in 2019, the suit was amended to target that system.",
      "The election system used statewide by nearly all in-person voters includes touch screen voting machines that print ballots with a human-readable summary of voters\u2019 selections and a QR code that a scanner reads to count the votes. The human-readable summary only lists the voter's choice, not the names of other candidates or the details of a ballot question.",
      "The activists and voters who filed the lawsuit argued that since people can't read a QR code, they are unable to ensure that what the scanners are reading accurately reflects their selections. They also asserted that it is burdensome for voters to have to check their selections twice \u2014 once on the voting machine screen and again using the limited information on the printed ballot.",
      "They asked Totenberg to stop the state from using the touch screen voting machine system as the standard method for in-person voting.",
      "\u201cAlthough Plaintiffs have not ultimately prevailed on their legal claims, their work has identified substantial concerns about the administration, maintenance, and security of Georgia\u2019s electronic in-person voting system,\u201d Totenberg wrote. \u201cThese investigative and educational efforts have prompted meaningful legislative action to bolster the transparency and accountability of Georgia's voting systems.\u201d",
      "In addition to other changes, a law passed by Georgia lawmakers last year requires QR codes to be removed from ballots by July 2026, though she noted that funding and government action would be required to implement that change.",
      "The judge outlined the evidence presented at trial in early 2024, including the findings of University of Michigan computer scientist and professor J. Alex Halderman. He testified that an attacker could potentially alter the QR codes to change voter selections, install malware on the voting machines and obtain county-wide passwords, among other issues, she wrote.",
      "A report Halderman wrote in 2021 as part of this lawsuit prompted the federal Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency in 2022 to put out advisory recommending steps that should be taken by election officials in places that use the voting machines that Georgia uses. Georgia election officials in 2023 said they planned to wait until after the 2024 election to install a software update to address some of the security flaws, saying they had taken other measures to protect the state's voting system.",
      "Totenberg's ruling puts an end to a long and twisting path. Throughout the process she has repeatedly raised concerns about the state's voting system and practices and, early on, accused state officials of ignoring problems. In an August 2019 ruling, she prohibited the state from using its antiquated paperless voting machines beyond that year. The state had agreed to purchase new voting machines from Dominion a few weeks earlier and scrambled to deploy them ahead of the 2020 election cycle.",
      "Conspiracy theorists and people looking to give credence to Trump's claims of a stolen election have seized on Totenberg's intermediate rulings in the case, as well as on Halderman's findings. But Halderman has always made clear that his mission was to identify vulnerabilities in the system, that he was not tasked with looking for and had not found any evidence that those weaknesses had been exploited.",

      "TOKYO -- Japan\u2019s Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba said Tuesday his government is making last ditch efforts to get U.S. President Donald Trump to exclude his country from an increase in auto tariffs due to take effect from Wednesday.",
      "Ishiba told reporters he is willing to fly to Washington to negotiate directly with Trump. The U.S. will begin collecting 25% tariffs on auto imports on Thursday, with taxes on fully-imported cars kicking in at midnight, U.S. time. The tariffs are set to expand to applicable auto parts in weeks to come.",
      "So far, Japan has not managed to win exemptions from the tariffs hitlist despite its status as the biggest U.S. ally in Asia. Japan has stepped up cooperation with other countries that also are being affected. Japanese Trade Ninister Yoji Muto flew to Seoul to meet with his counterparts from South Korea and China and agreed to promote a free and fair trade and investment, saying Trump\u2019s trade policies are fueling protectionism.",
      "The higher tariffs are a worry for Japan and major automakers like Toyota Motor Corp. and Honda Motor Co. Their exports to the United States are a major driver for the Japanese economy. A quarterly survey by the Bank of Japan released Tuesday showed business sentiment among large manufacturers worsened in the past quarter for the first time in a year.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t mind going to Washington, if necessary,\" Ishiba said.",
      "He said officials from all related ministries, including foreign, trade and finance, are working \u201cday and night,\u201d to negotiate with their U.S. counterparts to resolve the issue. \"When I see the overall picture and judge that it is appropriate for me to go, I must do so without hesitation, he said.",
      "If the tariffs are imposed, he said the government will do what it must to minimize their impact on Japanese industries and jobs.",
      "As short-term measures, the government plans to set up 1,000 consultation windows across the country to respond to concerns of small to medium-size auto parts makers and other manufacturers that would be affected by the U.S. tariff increase.",
      "In case of damage to actual businesses, the government will do its utmost to support cash-strapped business owners, Ishiba said.",

      "In interviews with company officials and residents, The Associated Press explored one of the growing number of foreign investment projects targeting Africa, home to about 60% of the world\u2019s remaining uncultivated arable land. Like this one, many fail, often far from public notice.",
      "Internal company documents seen by the AP show how the plans, endorsed by the Senegalese government, for exporting animal feed to wealthy Gulf nations fell apart.",
      "At first glance, the landscape of stark acacia trees on the edge of the Sahara Desert doesn\u2019t hold much agricultural promise. But in an age of climate change, foreign investors are looking at this and other African landscapes.",

      "In 2021, the Senegalese village of Ni\u00e9ti Yone welcomed investors Frank Timis and Gora Seck from a U.S.-registered company, African Agriculture. Over cups of sweet green tea, the visitors promised to employ hundreds of locals and, one day, thousands.",
      "Timis, originally from Romania, was the majority stakeholder. His companies have mined for gold, minerals and fossil fuels across West Africa.",
      "Seck, a Senegalese mining investor, chaired an Italian company whose biofuel plans for the land parcel had failed. It sold the 50-year lease for 20,000 hectares to Timis for $7.9 million. Seck came on as president of African Agriculture's Senegalese subsidiary and holds 4.8% of its shares.",

      "The land was next to Senegal\u2019s largest freshwater lake, for which the company obtained water rights. African Agriculture planned to grow alfalfa and export it to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. Both traditionally buy alfalfa from the U.S., but the amount of land in alfalfa production there has dropped by 38% in the last 20 years, largely due to drought caused by climate change, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.",
      "The proposal divided the community of subsistence farmers. Herders who had raised livestock on the land for generations opposed it. Others, like Doudou Ndiaye Mboup, thought it could help ease Senegal's unemployment crisis.",
      "\u201cI bought their dream. I saw thousands of young Africans with jobs and prosperity,\u201d said Mboup, who was later employed as an electrician and now leads a union of employees.",

      "African Agriculture valued the company at $450 million. The Oakland Institute, an environmental think tank in the U.S., questioned that amount and called the deal bad for food security as well as greenhouse gas emissions.",
      "The company went public in December 2023, with shares trading at $8 on the NASDAQ exchange. It raised $22.6 million during the offering but had to pay $19 million to the listed but inactive company it had merged with.",
      "That payment signaled trouble to investors. It showed that the other company, 0X Capital Venture Acquisition Corp. II, didn't want to hold its 98% of stock. And it highlighted the way African Agriculture had used the merger to bypass the vetting process needed for listing.",
      "One year later, shares in African Agriculture were worth almost nothing.",
      "Now, security guards patrol the land's barbed-wire perimeter, blocking herders and farmers from using it. The company has been delisted.",
      "Mboup said he and others haven\u2019t been paid for six months. The workers took the company to employment court in Senegal to claim about $180,000 in unpaid wages. In February, they burned tires outside the company's office. Mboup later said an agreement was reached for back wages to be paid in June.",
      "\u201cI took out loans to build a house and now I can\u2019t pay it back,\u201d said Mboup, who had been making $200 a month, just above average for Senegal. \u201cI\u2019ve sold my motorbike and sheep to feed my children and send them to school, but many are not so lucky.\u201d",
      "Timis didn't respond to questions. Seck told the AP he was no longer affiliated with African Agriculture. Current CEO Mike Rhodes said he had been advised to not comment.",
      "Herders and farmers are furious and have urged Senegal's government to let them use the land. But that rarely happens. In a study of 63 such foreign deals, the International Institute of Social Studies found only 11% of land was returned to the community. In most cases, the land is offered to other investors.",
      "\u201cWe want to work with the government to rectify this situation. If not, we will fight,\" warned Bayal Sow, the area\u2019s deputy mayor.",
      "The Senegalese minister of agriculture, food sovereignty and herding, Mabouba Diagne, did not respond to questions. The African Agriculture deal occurred under the previous administration.",

      "Meanwhile, African Agriculture's former CEO has moved on to a bigger land deal elsewhere on the continent \u2014 with experts raising questions again.",
      "In August, South African Alan Kessler announced his new company, African Food Security, partnering with a Cameroonian, Baba Danpullo. It has announced a project roughly 30 times the size of the one in Senegal, with 635,000 hectares in Congo and Cameroon.",
      "The new company seeks $875 million in investment. The company\u2019s investor prospectus, obtained by the AP, says it plans to register in Abu Dhabi.",
      "In an interview with the AP in January, Kessler blamed the failure of the Senegal project on the way African Agriculture's public offering was structured. He said there were no plans for a public offering this time.",
      "He claimed his new company's project would double corn production in these countries, and described African Food Security as the \u201cmost incredibly important development company on the planet.\u201d He said they have started to grow corn on 200 hectares in Cameroon.",
      "Experts who looked over the prospectus raised concerns about its claims, including an unusually high projection for corn yields. Kessler rejected those concerns.",
      "\u201cWhen he was CEO of African Agriculture, Kessler also made lofty claims about food production, job creation, exports and investment returns that did not pan out,\u201d said Ren\u00e9e Vellv\u00e9, co-founder of GRAIN, a Spain-based nonprofit for land rights.",
      "Hype without proof was a key strategy for African Agriculture, said its former chief operating officer, Javier Orellana, who said he is owed 165,000 euros ($178,000) in unpaid salary after leaving the company in 2023.",
      "He told the AP he had been suspicious of the company\u2019s $450 million valuation.",
      "\u201cI know the agriculture industry well and ($450 million) didn\u2019t add up,\u201d Orellana said, adding he stayed on because the company gave him what he called a very attractive offer.",
      "In the end, a share in African Agriculture is now worth less than a penny.",
      "\u201cWe are looking forward to going back to Senegal,\u201d Kessler said. \"We were appreciated there. We\u2019ve been welcomed back there.\u201d",

      "The sanctions are expected to further escalate tensions between Washington and Beijing, who are already locked in friction over trade tariffs and other issues like Taiwan.",
      "\u201cBeijing and Hong Kong officials have used Hong Kong national security laws extraterritorially to intimidate, silence, and harass 19 pro-democracy activists who were forced to flee overseas, including a U.S. citizen and four other U.S. residents,\u201d the U.S. State Department said.",
      "The statement dated Monday said the six officials sanctioned were linked to entities or actions that engaged in coercing, arresting, detaining or imprisoning individuals under the authority of the city's security law, or implementing the law.",
      "The other three affected officials were Sonny Au, the secretary-general for the city's committee for safeguarding national security, and Dick Wong and Margaret Chiu, both assistant commissioners of the police.",
      "Since Beijing imposed a national security law in 2020 to quell the 2019 massive anti-government protests, Hong Kong authorities have prosecuted many leading activists in the former British colony, which returned to Chinese rule in 1997.",
      "The crackdown has drawn criticism from foreign governments, especially because the city was promised that its Western-style civil liberties and semi-autonomy would be kept intact for at least 50 years during the 1997 handover. Beijing and Hong Kong governments insist the law is necessary for the city\u2019s stability.",
      "Over the past two years, Hong Kong authorities have issued arrest warrants for 19 activists based overseas, with bounties of $1 million Hong Kong dollars ($128,536) for information leading to each of their arrests. The affected activists included former pro-democracy lawmakers Nathan Law and Ted Hui. They also canceled the passports of some of the overseas-based activists under a new security law introduced to the city last year.",
      "The Hong Kong office of China's foreign ministry condemned the sanctions, saying they again exposed the ill-intention of the U.S. to undermine the city's prosperity and contain China's development. It urged Washington to stop interfering in the city's affairs.",
      "\u201cChina will surely take effective countermeasures against these despicable acts by the U.S.!\u201d it said in a statement.",

      "The Hong Kong government strongly condemned the U.S. for the sanctions, saying it despises them and is not intimidated by them.",
      "\u201cIt, once again, clearly exposed the U.S.\u2019 barbarity under its hegemony, which is exactly the same as its recent tactics in bullying and coercing various countries and regions,\u201d it said in a statement.",

      "The utility announced that its board picked Moul as president and chief executive to replace Jeff Lyash, who said in January that he would retire no later than September. The move comes less than a week after Trump removed one of the utility's board members without indicating why. With the firing of Michelle Moore, an appointee of former President Joe Biden, the board currently has five members and four vacancies.",
      "The board firing and CEO hiring come after Tennessee's two Republican U.S. senators urged officials to opt for \u201can interim CEO trusted by the president\u201d before hiring someone long-term.",
      "Moul has served as TVA's executive vice president and chief operating officer since June 2021. In a news release announcing his selection, TVA focused in part on Moul's leadership in the advancement of nuclear energy technologies and his experience as a licensed senior reactor operator. He starts in the new role on April 9.",
      "\u201cTVA needs a steady hand right now,\" Moul said in the news release. \"I will build on the momentum that Jeff and our team have created -\u2013 making sure we continue to invest in new generation, strengthen our grid and enhance system reliability.\u201d",

      "Blackburn and Hagerty also said that hiring a CEO from within would forgo the chance to recruit a \u201ctop-quality leader\u201d from outside the utility, which provides power to 10 million people across seven Southern states.",
      "In part, advocates for nuclear energy have called for its expansion to help meet the demand from companies to power their artificial intelligence technologies, and do so without carbon emissions that speed up climate change.",
      "Stephen Smith, executive director of the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy, called the op-ed by Blackburn and Hagerty \u201creckless interference.\u201d He said they don't understand the \u201crisk of rushing nuclear technology before it\u2019s ready for prime time both economically and safety-wise.\u201d",
      "Clean energy advocates have also criticized TVA's decision to replace several of its aging coal plants with another fossil fuel, natural gas.",
      "Trump put TVA and the outgoing CEO Lyash on the hot seat in his first term.",
      "In 2020, Trump fired the former TVA board chairman and another board member and drove TVA to reverse course on the hiring of foreign labor for information technology jobs.",
      "He also called for Lyash\u2019s replacement and the position\u2019s pay to be capped at $500,000.",
      "In response, TVA has noted that the CEO pay ranks in the bottom quartile of the power industry. Lyash\u2019s total compensation topped $10.5 million in the 2024 budget year, including various pension and performance incentives worth millions of dollars. Additionally, the utility has stressed that it doesn\u2019t receive federal taxpayer money and instead is funded by electricity customers.",

      "Real estate, high-yield bonds, and cryptocurrency don\u2019t always live up to their reputation as portfolio diversifiers",
      "Diversification is a core principle of sound investing: A portfolio that includes assets with different performance characteristics often leads to better risk-adjusted returns than one that relies on a single asset class.",
      "But building a diversified portfolio can be easier in theory than practice, as many asset classes often touted as good portfolio diversifiers may not live up to their reputation.",
      "In some past periods, real estate investment trusts didn\u2019t move closely in tandem with the broader US equity market.",
      "Rolling three-year correlations have dropped as low as 0.10 during some periods, such as the early 2000s. And being untethered to the overall equity market can lead to better risk-adjusted returns when real estate is added to a diversified portfolio.",
      "In recent years, however, real estate has generally moved more in line with stocks overall. This has also made it a less valuable cushion against bear-market declines.",
      "Real estate had previously held up better than the overall market during some market corrections, such as the tech-stock correction that started in early 2000. But during the three most recent bear markets, real estate suffered heavier-than-average losses.",
      "High-yield bonds (also known as junk bonds) are issued by corporations with below-average credit ratings, generally defined as BB+ or lower from a major credit rating agency.",
      "As a result, they tend to trade more in line with broad credit markets, overall economic trends, and company-specific factors than they do with Treasuries. As a result, they\u2019re less sensitive to interest-rate movements than investment-grade bonds, which means they can provide diversification benefits within the bond portion of a portfolio.",
      "At the same time, though, high-yield bonds have a relatively high correlation with stocks. They typically suffer during periods of weaker economic growth, which are also negative for stocks.",
      "Granted, high-yield bonds have historically provided some protection from market drawdowns. However, Treasuries have done a much better job of cushioning downside risk.",
      "As an asset that exists purely in digital form, cryptocurrency is fundamentally different from other major asset classes.",
      "Bitcoin still accounts for most of the investor interest and assets, but numerous digital currencies have also attracted more attention from both retail and institutional investors over the past couple of years.",
      "As a nontraditional asset, cryptocurrency has had an extremely low correlation with most other major asset classes.But there are two reasons crypto may not make the best portfolio diversifier.",
      "First, as digital assets have attracted more interest from mainstream investors, correlations have steadily trended up in recent years.",
      "Second, crypto\u2019s potential diversification value has been overshadowed by its extreme performance swings. Instead of acting like a noncorrelated asset, digital assets are mainly defined by their extreme volatility. Over the past three years, bitcoin has been nearly 4 times as volatile as stocks. Much of this volatility has been on the upside, but bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have also been subject to extreme drawdown risk.",
      "The three examples discussed above underscore two of the limitations of correlation metrics. First, correlations can change over time, meaning that assets that were once great diversifiers may no longer be so. And second, even assets that still have a relatively low correlation coefficient may still be subject to above-average downside risk.",

He's taken to calling the date \"Liberation Day'' because his protectionist policies aim to free the U.S. economy from dependence on foreign goods.",
      "The president is an unabashed tariff supporter. He used them liberally in his first term and is deploying them even more aggressively in his second. Since returning to the White House, he has slapped 20% tariffs on China, unveiled a 25% tax on imported cars and trucks set to take effect Thursday, effectively raised U.S. taxes on foreign steel and aluminum and imposed levies on some goods from Canada and Mexico, which he may expand this week.",
      "Economists don't share Trump's enthusiasm for tariffs. They're a tax on importers that usually get passed on to consumers. But it's possible that Trump's reciprocal tariff threat could bring other countries to the table and get them to lower their own import taxes.",
      "\u201cIt could be win-win,\u201d said Christine McDaniel, a former U.S. trade official now at George Mason University\u2019s Mercatus Center. \u201cIt\u2019s in other countries\u2019 interests to reduce those tariffs.\u201d",
      "She noted that India has already cut tariffs on items from motorcycles to luxury cars and agreed to ramp up purchases of U.S. energy.",
      "They sound simple: The United States would raise its tariff on foreign goods to match what other countries impose on U.S. products.",
      "\u201cIf they charge us, we charge them,\u2019\u2019 the president said in February. \u201cIf they\u2019re at 25, we\u2019re at 25. If they\u2019re at 10, we\u2019re at 10. And if they\u2019re much higher than 25, that\u2019s what we are too.\u2019\u2019",
      "But the White House didn\u2019t reveal many details. It has directed Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick to deliver a report this week about how the new tariffs would actually work.",
      "Among the outstanding questions, noted Antonio Rivera, a partner at ArentFox Schiff and a former attorney with U.S. Customs and Border Protection, is whether the U.S. is going to look at the thousands of items in the tariff code \u2013 from motorcycles to mangos -- and try to level the tariff rates out one by one, country by country. Or whether it will look more broadly at each country\u2019s average tariff and how it compares to America. Or something else entirely.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s just a very, very chaotic environment,\u201d said Stephen Lamar, president and CEO of the American Apparel & Footwear Association. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to plan in any sort of long-term, sustainable way.\u2019\u2019",
      "America\u2019s tariffs are generally lower than those of its trading partners. After World War II, the United States pushed for other countries to lower trade barriers and tariffs, seeing free trade as a way to promote peace, prosperity and American exports around the world. And it mostly practiced what it preached, generally keeping its own tariffs low and giving American consumers access to inexpensive foreign goods.",
      "Trump has broken with the old free trade consensus, saying unfair foreign competition has hurt American manufacturers and devastated factory towns in the American heartland. During his first term, he slapped tariffs on foreign steel, aluminum, washing machines, solar panels and almost everything from China. Democratic President Joe Biden largely continued Trump\u2019s protectionist policies.",
      "The White House has cited several examples of especially lopsided tariffs: Brazil taxes ethanol imports, including America\u2019s, at 18%, but the U.S. tariff on ethanol is just 2.5%. Likewise, India taxes foreign motorcycles at 100%, America just 2.4%.",
      "The higher foreign tariffs that Trump complains about weren\u2019t sneakily adopted by foreign countries. The United States agreed to them after years of complex negotiations known as the Uruguay Round, which ended in a trade pact involving 123 countries.",
      "As part of the deal, the countries could set their own tariffs on different products \u2013 but under the \u201cmost favored nation\u2019\u2019 approach, they couldn\u2019t charge one country more than they charged another. So the high tariffs Trump complains about aren\u2019t aimed at the United States alone. They hit everybody.",
      "Trump\u2019s grievances against U.S. trading partners also come at an odd time. The United States, running on strong consumer spending and healthy improvements in productivity, is outperforming the world\u2019s other advanced economies. The U.S. economy grew nearly 9% from just before COVID-19 hit through the middle of last year \u2014 compared with just 5.5% for Canada and just 1.9% for the European Union. Germany's economy shrank 2% during that time.",
      "Not satisfied with scrambling the tariff code, Trump is also going after other foreign practices he sees as unfair barriers to American exports. These include subsidies that give homegrown producers an advantage over U.S. exports; ostensible health rules that are used to keep out foreign products; and loose regulations that encourage the theft of trade secrets and other intellectual property.",
      "Figuring out an import tax that offsets the damage from those practices will add another level of complexity to Trump\u2019s reciprocal tariff scheme.",
      "The Trump team is also picking a fight with the European Union and other trading partners over so-called value-added taxes. Known as VATs, these levies are essentially a sales tax on products that are consumed within a country\u2019s borders. Trump and his advisers consider VATs a tariff because they apply to U.S. exports.",
      "Yet most economists disagree, for a simple reason: VATs are applied to domestic and imported products alike, so they don't specifically target foreign goods and haven't traditionally been seen as a trade barrier.",
      "And there\u2019s a bigger problem: VATs are huge revenue raisers for European governments. \u201cThere is no way most countries can negotiate over their VAT ... as it is a critical part of their revenue base,\u2019\u2019 Brad Setser, senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, posted on X.",
      "Paul Ashworth, chief North America economist for Capital Economics, says that the top 15 countries that export to the U.S. have average VATs topping 14%, as well as duties of 6%. That would mean U.S. retaliatory tariffs could reach 20% \u2014 much higher than Trump's campaign proposal of universal 10% duties.",
      "Trump and some of his advisers argue that steeper tariffs would help reverse the United States' long-standing trade deficits.",
      "But tariffs haven't proven successful at narrowing the trade gap: Despite the Trump-Biden import taxes, the deficit rose last year to $918 billion, second-highest on record.",
      "The deficit, economists say, is a result of the unique features of the U.S. economy. Because the federal government runs a huge deficit, and American consumers like to spend so much, U.S. consumption and investment far outpaces savings. As a result, a chunk of that demand goes to overseas goods and services.",
      "The U.S. covers the cost of the trade gap by essentially borrowing from overseas, in part by selling treasury securities and other assets.",
      "\u201cThe trade deficit is really a macroeconomic imbalance,\" said Kimberly Clausing, a UCLA economist and former Treasury official. \u201cIt comes from this lack of desire to save and this lack of desire to tax. Until you fix those things, we\u2019ll run a trade imbalance.\u201d",

      "The latest season of \u201cLove Is Blind\u201d featured a ton of popular music in its soundtrack",
      "NEW YORK -- When a couple decided to take their relationship further on the most recent season of \u201cLove Is Blind,\u201d the moment was soundtracked with a familiar song: Billie Eilish\u2019s \u201cBirds of a Feather.\u201d",
      "It wasn\u2019t a flash-in-the-pan musical surprise. The season was stacked with familiar needle drops \u2014 Miley Cyrus\u2019 \u201cWrecking Ball,\u201d Justin Bieber\u2019s \u201cHoly,\u201d Ariana Grande\u2019s \u201cInto You,\u201d Selena Gomez\u2019s \u201cLose You to Love Me\u201d \u2014 a gesture away from the little-known, sometimes generic pop songs that used to meet the show's most emotional moments.",
      "Show creator and Kinetic Content CEO Chris Coelen attributed the pivot to the show's anniversary.",
      "\u201cWe decided, in this Season 8, to coincide with our fifth anniversary, to really embrace popular music in a big way,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd so, we ended up using \u2014 throughout the entire season and in every episode \u2014 we used popular music cues.\u201d",
      "\u201cLove Is Blind\u201d isn\u2019t the only reality show that walks the line between what viewers have labeled \u201creal songs\u201d and unfamiliar music.",
      "It\u2019s not artificial intelligence, where \u201cnobody controls the copyright,\u201d says \u201cThe Bachelor\u201d music supervisor Jody Friedman. \u201cThere\u2019s too much risk involved with using AI music in these projects.\u201d",
      "Excluding big-time pop records, the music used on television comes from a number of sources. It can be custom, original music by the show\u2019s composers. It can be licensed directly from artists, or from sync agents, production music libraries or a \u201cone stop,\u201d what supervisors call a company that has the rights to license both the master recording and the composition rights.",
      "Music supervisors might also turn to covers of well-known songs. On the most recent season of \u201cThe Bachelor,\u201d Friedman used a cover of Phil Phillips\u2019 \u201cSea of Love,\u201d a classic \u201950s tune. It\u2019s more affordable to pay to license a cover than the original recording \u2014 \u201cand creatively, it\u2019s a modern take on an old song,\u201d he says.",
      "\u201cLove Island USA\u201d music supervisor Sara Torres also uses covers.",
      "\u201cThat can bring in other listeners that may not necessarily be into pop, but if they hear the song in a different genre, it might pull them in, to go back and listen to the original version,\u201d she says.",
      "Music libraries \u2014 companies that represent music catalogs for licensing purposes \u2014 are key, too, because if a song is too expensive to license, a supervisor can instead find a song that evokes the feeling of BTS\u2019 \u201cButter\u201d without having to pay for it.",
      "\u201cThe indie libraries, let\u2019s say, for TV, could be anywhere from $1,000-1,500 per needle drop use,\u201d says Friedman. For TV shows in general, bigger commercial songs can range from $20,000 to upward of $100,000, with high-profile songs earning more depending on the use, he says.",
      "The use of instantly recognizable pop music differs from program to program.",
      "\u201cLove Is Blind\u201d has used popular music in the past, but sparingly. Coelen points out the use of Lee Ann Womack\u2019s \u201cI Hope You Dance\u201d in Bliss Poureetezadi and Zack Goytowski\u2019s story in Season 4. But the frequency of Top 40 hits in the most recent season is new.",
      "He says the benefit of using these songs, creatively, is that it \u201celevates the experience,\u201d for the viewer: \u201cEmotions are so connected to certain pieces of music, and they can conjure up feelings that we relate to.\u201d",
      "Kinetic Content declined The Associated Press\u2019 request to speak with the show\u2019s music supervisor, Jon Ernst.",
      "\u201cLove Island USA\u201d featured songs like Chappell Roan\u2019s \u201cKaleidoscope\u201d and Sabrina Carpenter\u2019s \u201cPlease Please Please\u201d in its most recent season. Executive producer James Barker points out that the original U.K. show has always used commercial music, and therefore the U.S. version has endeavored to do the same.",
      "\u201cThe show is meant to feel like you\u2019re on vacation with your best friends. Of course, when you\u2019re on vacation, you\u2019re sharing music,\u201d he says. \u201cI think that translates into how we create the show.\u201d",
      "Torres agrees. She adds that the show typically uses more commercial music in the beginning of the season, and then again in the finale \u2014 \u201cyou want that big impact.\u201d",
      "Because the show has a quick turnaround time, with six episodes a week \u2014 \u201cwhatever happens in Fiji on Monday airs Tuesday in America,\u201d as Barker describes it \u2014 the show team \u201cpre-clears\u201d over a thousand songs, just in case they work for a particular narrative moment. That means requests are sent out to publishers and labels ahead of time, but they're not paid for until the tracks are selected.",
      "A show with more lead time, \u201cThe Bachelor\u201d has long used commercial songs in its programming. This year's season, the show's 29th, had several memorable musical moments, including a Cardi B, Bad Bunny and J Balvin needle drop when \u201cI Like It\u201d played as the cast made their way to Madrid.",
      "\u201cThis is my first season with \u2018The Bachelor,\u2019 but historically they\u2019ve used Colbie Caillat, Boyz II Men, Backstreet Boys,\u201d lists Friedman. \u201cThey used Billie Eilish last season. This season we used a David Guetta track, Dropkick Murphys for the episode in Boston. There\u2019s a Karol G track.\u201d",
      "He adds \u201cThe Bachelor\u201d does use a lot of recognizable pop songs, typically one or two per episode.",
      "\u201cEach episode does have a budget. So, while they may splurge on a pop song, the rest of the budget\u201d is spent on other music that comes at a lower cost, he says.",
      "For \u201cLove Is Blind,\u201d Coelen says simply: \u201cThe answer is yes.\u201d",
      "Barker from \u201cLove Island USA\u201d agrees.",
      "\u201cNot only are you engaged with the characters, but the songs and artists that you care about listening to at home are being represented on television,\u201d he adds. \u201cIt\u2019s just a bridge between us all.\u201d",

      "When Naruemon arrived at the site the following day, the scene of the ruins broke her spirit.",
      "\u201cI had a meltdown. I could only pray. I kept calling for them,\u201d she said. \u201cI wanted them to come back. I was so devastated. I didn\u2019t know what to do.\u201d",
      "For two days, Naruemon walked around near the site with her family and friends, hoping to see any developments as heavy machines and rescue crews searched for survivors. She prayed and performed a religious rite asking the spirits to protect her loved ones.",
      "\u201cI want everyone trapped there to be found. In whatever conditions, I\u2019m ok with it,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve already made some peace with it. It\u2019s been a few days already. A part of me still hopes they will survive, for a miracle, if it exists.\u201d",

He refused to provide a reason, saying only that Colliander was put on administrative leave from the Paralympic team in December \u2014 days after the AP report on the alleged misconduct. The two were fired on March 14.",
      "Colliander was accused of sexually abusing Grace Boutot, a biathlete he coached at the Maine Winter Sports Center over four years beginning in 2006 when she was 15, the AP reported. Colliander quit the job after Boutot's October 2010 suicide attempt and was later hired by the U.S. Paralympic Nordic team.",
      "Carey was the Maine center's vice president at the time of the abuse and had discussed it with Boutot\u2019s mother. After leaving the center in December 2010, Carey was hired as a coach and later promoted to director of the Paralympic team. She was there when Colliander came onboard.",
      "Mason declined to say whether Carey hired Colliander or how the Paralympic team vets the coaches they hire. The U.S. Center for SafeSport, created to investigate sex-abuse allegations in Olympic sports in the aftermath of the Larry Nassar U.S. Gymnastics scandal, launched an investigation into Colliander in December.",
      "\u201cPlease note that Mr. Colliander\u2019s case remains active with SafeSport,\u201d Mason told the AP.",
      "Colliander's lawyer, Simone Montoya, said officials did not tell Colliander why he was fired and he \u201cadamantly denies any wrongdoing or inappropriate behavior, as alleged.\u201d",
      "Colliander \"is committed to full and transparent cooperation into this matter,\u201d Montoya told the AP in an email. \u201cHe denies any conduct in violation of the SafeSport Code or applicable laws and policies and maintains that he has always upheld professional standards throughout his career.\u201d",

      "Boutot was among a half-dozen Olympians and other biathletes who came forward after the AP reported last year that Olympian Joanne Reid was sexually abused and harassed for years, according to SafeSport findings. Biathlon is a winter sport that combines cross-country skiing with target shooting.",
      "The AP generally does not identify victims of sexual abuse except in cases where they publicly identify themselves or share their stories openly.",
      "Boutot, 34, told the AP that when Colliander began coaching her, he gave her a lot of attention, including inappropriate touching. The conduct escalated after she turned 18 to \u201ckissing, sexual fondling and oral sex,\u201d according to a treatment summary by her therapist, Jacqueline Pauli-Ritz, shared with the AP.",
      "Boutot said she begged Colliander to stop but he ignored her. She became severely depressed and started cutting herself, according to the therapist\u2019s notes. In September 2010, Pauli-Ritz contacted Colliander and told him Boutot was suffering from major depression and he should stop coaching her, the treatment summary said.",

      "Colliander resigned the next day. He took a coaching job in Colorado and was hired in December 2016 by the U.S. Paralympic team. He was associate director of high performance for U.S. Paralympics Nordic Skiing before being fired.",
      "Boutot tried to keep racing but faced discrimination by the center's staff and teammates, who blamed her for his departure, according to a letter she wrote to the Maine Sports Center's board in January 2011.",
      "Boutot's mother, Karen Gorman, had repeated discussions and email exchanges with Carey and the center's CEO, Andy Shepard, about the abuse her daughter suffered, Gorman told the AP.",
      "In an Oct. 22, 2010, email, Gorman told them, \u201cthe issue of any coach-athlete relationships ... must be scrutinized\" by the Maine sports center.",

      "The one-year trial version of the dynamic kickoff in the NFL led to an uptick in the return rate that wasn\u2019t quite as much as the league had hoped",
      "The one-year trial version of the dynamic kickoff in the NFL led to an uptick in the return rate that wasn't quite as much as the league had hoped.",
      "Now the new form of the kickoff that is more like a scrimmage play is permanent with a change for 2025 that the league hopes will lead to a significant increase in returns.",
      "Owners voted Tuesday to move touchbacks on kicks from the 30 to the 35 in hopes that more teams will kick the ball in play instead of giving up an extra 5 yards of field position.",
      "The league also approved changes to the overtime rule, expanded replay assist and made a few other technical changes at the league meetings in Palm Beach, Florida.",
      "Here\u2019s an explanation of some of the new rules that will be in place.",
      "The league was mostly pleased with the experimental kickoff put in place for 2024 that led to the rate of kickoff returns increasing from a record-low 21.8% in 2023 to 32.8% last season, while reducing the rate of injuries on what had been the game's most dangerous play.",
      "The rule made kickoffs more like scrimmage plays by placing the coverage players and blockers close together to eliminate the high-speed collisions that had contributed to so many injuries on the play. The league said the rate of concussions dropped 43% on returns with a significant reduction as well on lower-body injuries.",
      "The problem last season was many teams still opted to kick the ball in the end zone because the touchback wasn't punitive enough with the average starting field position on a touchback being only 2.4 further than the average starting position after returns that was the 27.6-yard line.",
      "By moving the touchback to the 35, the league projects that the return rate will rise to somewhere between 60% and 70% with a similar increase in long returns, adding more excitement to the game.",
      "The league also approved a small tweak to how how blockers on the return team are allowed to line up in the setup zone that could lead to longer returns.",
      "The league approved a proposal to make regular season overtime more like the postseason with both teams getting a chance at a possession, even if the team that got the ball first scored a touchdown.",
      "The NFL added regular season overtime in 1974, adding a 15-minute sudden death period that ended on any score. In 2010, the rule was tweaked to a \u201cmodified\u201d sudden death that required an opening possession touchdown to immediately end the game instead of only a field goal in both the regular season and playoffs.",
      "Overtime then was shortened for the regular season to only 10 minutes in 2017. A rule change in 2022 for the playoffs only gave both teams the chance to score even with a touchdown on the opening possession.",
      "Now that will be the case in the playoffs, after the improved field position on kickoffs made winning in OT on an opening possession TD easier.",
      "According to Sportradar, six of the 16 overtime games last season ended on an opening drive TD for the most overtime games ended on the first drive since the rule change went into effect in 2010.",
      "In all, teams that won the overtime toss won 75% of the time last season, according to Sportradar, and have a .606 winning percentage in overtime since it was cut to 10 minutes.",
      "The league kept the 10-minute overtime period instead of expanding it back to 15 minutes like was originally proposed by Philadelphia, which could lead teams opting to go for 2 and a win if they match an opening drive TD with one of their own since there might not be time for another possession.",
      "The NFL expanded its replay assist system to overturn objective calls such as facemask penalties, whether there was forcible contact to the head or neck area, horse-collar tackles, tripping if there was \u201cclear and obvious\u201d evidence that a foul didn\u2019t occur. Replay also would be able to overturn a roughing-the-kicker or running-into-the-kicker penalty if video showed the defender made contact with the ball.",
      "The league has been using replay assist in recent years to overturn obvious errors on aspects like whether a pass is caught or where the ball should be spotted without the referee needing to stop the game for a review.",
      "The Competition Committee says there's no interest in allowing replay assists to call penalties on plays missed by officials on the field.",
      "There were a few procedural rules changed. Teams will now by able to conduct Zoom or phone meetings with prospective free agents during the so-called legal tampering period.",
      "Teams can place two players on injured reserve with the designation to return when rosters are reduced to 53 players instead of after. Playoff teams also will be granted two additional return from IR designations.",
      "A proposal by Green Bay to outlaw the tush push that Philadelphia has used so successfully was tabled until the May meetings. A vote on a proposal to tweak the onside kick rule also was delayed until May, along with a proposal by Detroit to change the playoff seeding to place wild-card teams ahead of a division winner with a worse record.",

      "\u201cObviously things went too far,\u201d Bickerstaff said after that game. \u201cBut what you see is guys looking out for one another, guys trying to protect one another, guys trying to have each other\u2019s backs. ... Those are nonnegotiables in our locker room.\u201d",
      "The incident began when Holland fouled Reid with 8:36 left in the second quarter of the Timberwolves\u2019 123-104 victory over the Pistons in Minneapolis. Reid confronted Holland, who then pushed DiVincenzo, who then shoved Holland \u2014 and they wound up falling into spectators seated along the baseline.",
      "Stewart and Sasser then entered the altercation, \u201cwhich resulted in a continued escalation of the situation,\u201d the league said.",
      "Reid and DiVincenzo will serve their one-game suspensions Tuesday when the Timberwolves visit Denver. Stewart will begin serving his suspension Wednesday when the Pistons visit Oklahoma City, and Holland and Sasser also will serve their suspensions in that game.",

      "The future of the \u201ctush push\u201d should be decided on Tuesday following debates about the safety of a play that\u2019s helped the Philadelphia Eagles win one Super Bowl and reach another",
      "PALM BEACH, Fla. -- The future of the \u201ctush push\u201d should be decided on Tuesday following debates about the safety of a play that\u2019s helped the Philadelphia Eagles win one Super Bowl and reach another.",
      "NFL owners are set to vote on Green Bay\u2019s proposal to ban the play along with other potential rules changes, including playoff seeding and kickoffs.",
      "Even though the league has said there haven\u2019t been any injuries reported as a result of the \u201ctush push,\u201d the potential risk involved in Philadelphia\u2019s version of the quarterback sneak has sparked intense discussions.",
      "The Packers, who lost to the Eagles in a wild-card playoff game, also cited pace of a play as a reason to consider eliminating the play. Rams coach Sean McVay is against it. Los Angeles also lost to Philadelphia in the playoffs. Bills coach Sean McDermott is leading the push to get rid of it even though Buffalo used it more than any team other than the Eagles.",
      "It\u2019ll take 24 of 32 votes to approve the ban.",
      "\u201cI feel where I\u2019m most concerned is, even though there is not significant data out there to this point, my biggest concern is the health and safety of the players, first and foremost,\u201d McDermott said at the league meetings on Monday. \u201cIt\u2019s two things. It\u2019s force, added force, No. 1, and then the posture of the players, being asked to execute that type of play, that\u2019s where my concern comes in. ... I\u2019m not a doctor. I\u2019m not going to get too deep into that situation there, in terms of how much data, how much sample. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s really always the best way to go. There is other data out there that suggests when you\u2019re in a posture like we\u2019re talking about, that can lead to serious injury. I think being responsible and proactive in that regard is the right way to go.\u201d",
      "The Eagles began using the play in short-yardage situations in 2022. Two or three players line up behind quarterback Jalen Hurts and push him forward. Several other teams, including the Bills, began using it but no team has matched Philadelphia\u2019s success rate.",
      "\u201cTough play to stop but then you\u2019re listening to that and the medical side and you probably could go either way with it,\u201d said Chiefs coach Andy Reid, whose team lost 40-22 to the Eagles in the Super Bowl. \u201cBut I would say if it\u2019s putting a player in a bad position, then you probably have to do something about it. But if it\u2019s not, it\u2019s a heck of a play.\u201d",
      "Other changes include making the dynamic kickoff rule permanent and overhauling the playoff format.",
      "The NFL competition committee has recommended sticking with the kickoff rule that was redesigned last year and tweaking it to move touchbacks to the 35-yard line in hopes of generating even more returns.",
      "The Detroit Lions proposed that playoff seeding should be based on record instead of automatically placing division winners in the top four spots.",
      "The committee also proposed an expansion of instant replay to allow replay assist to consult on-field officials to overrule objective calls such as facemask penalties, whether there was forcible contact to the head or neck area, horse-collar tackles or tripping if there was \u201cclear and obvious\u201d evidence that a foul didn\u2019t occur. Replay would also be able to overturn a roughing the kicker or running into the kicker penalty if video replay showed the defender made contact with the ball.",

      "The Boston Celtics will almost certainly connect on a history-making 3-pointer sometime this week. It should be Wednesday against the Miami Heat. If not, then it'll be Friday against the Phoenix Suns.",
      "It's coming. It's inevitable.",
      "This year's Celtics \u2014 the defending NBA champions \u2014 will go into the playoffs having set league records for 3-pointers made and 3-pointers attempted in a season.",
      "Everybody knows the Celtics shoot a ton of 3-pointers; they have taken at least 50 3s in a game 36 times this season \u2014 and they're a whopping 29-7 in those games after trying 62 of them in a win over Memphis on Monday night.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s just a matter of taking what the defense gives you,\u201d Celtics coach Joe Mazzulla said.",
      "Boston is now the first team in NBA history to take 60 3s in a game five times in the same season. They're up to 1,344 made 3s this season, now just 19 away from matching the record Golden State set two seasons ago \u2014 so that's within realistic reach against the Heat on Wednesday. They've tried 3,636 3s this season, 85 away from the record Houston set in 2018-19.",
      "This has been a talking point in the league for years. How many 3s are too many 3s?",
      "The Celtics don\u2019t care. Evidently, neither do about half of the other teams in the NBA.",
      "Boston is one of 15 clubs poised this season to break franchise records in either 3-pointers made, 3-pointers attempted, or both. Some teams \u2014 Chicago, Cleveland, Portland and San Antonio \u2014 have already set one or both of those club records with two weeks left in the season.",
      "Let's take a look inside the numbers:",
      "Now past 30,000 made 3s for the fourth consecutive season \u2014 James Harden made the 30,000th on Sunday \u2014 the NBA is on pace to smash the current total records for 3-pointers made and attempted in a season.",
      "The league record of 31,579 made 3s was set last season and the record of 86,535 attempted was set in the 2021-22 season. At the current pace, 33,000 made 3s is within reach and 92,000 of them getting attempted isn't impossible either.",
      "It'll be the 17th time in the last 22 seasons that the NBA has seen more 3s than ever before.",
      "Teams are trying 6.8% more 3-pointers, on average, than they did last season. This would be the biggest year-over-year jump in the last six seasons.",
      "Translation: The 3-point craze is not ending anytime soon.",
      "If you've paid any attention this season, you know this isn't just the Celtics going wild from deep. Almost every team is shooting 3s at a dizzying rate \u2014 with Chicago simply obliterating its team record.",
      "The Bulls had never made more than 941 3s in a season; they're at 1,171 already this season. They're on pace for massive increases over last season \u2014 up 36% increase in 3s made, up 32% in 3s attempted over a year ago.",
      "Also currently on pace to break club records for 3s made, attempted or both in a season: Boston, Brooklyn, Charlotte, Cleveland, Detroit, the Los Angeles Lakers, Memphis, Miami, Minnesota, Oklahoma City, Philadelphia, Phoenix, San Antonio and Washington.",
      "It's not for everyone. Houston is on pace for the eighth-most 3s made and attempted in a season; to be fair, the Rockets of a few years ago were of the go-go-go, shoot-shoot-shoot mold, and this team is not. Dallas and Milwaukee are both on pace for only the seventh-most 3s attempted in any of their seasons.",
      "The record number of players making 100 3-pointers in a season is 125, set last season. It could be topped; entering Monday, 118 players had at least 100 3s this season.",
      "Let's put this into more perspective: A decade ago \u2014 2014-15 \u2014 there were only 57 players to make 100 3-pointers.",
      "That number has more than doubled since.",
      "Making 10 3s doesn't guarantee winning \u2014 but not making at least 10 3s in a game puts teams in serious trouble.",
      "Entering Monday, teams that don't make at least 10 3-pointers lose 72% of the time this season. Teams that don't make at least 15 3-pointers lose 59% of the time.",
      "Teams that make 15 or more 3s in a game win 65% of the time. Here's a weird quirk, though: Making 20 or more 3s in a game has led to victory 74% of the time this season \u2014 which is actually down from 83% last season, 82% in 2022-23 and 91% in 2021-22.",
      "Not everyone is part of the 3-point craze.",
      "There are four players \u2014 the Los Angeles Clippers\u2019 Ivica Zubac, Detroit\u2019s Jalen Duren, Minnesota\u2019s Rudy Gobert and Dallas\u2019 Daniel Gafford \u2014 who have at least 500 points this season and have yet to try a 3-point shot.",
      "Cleveland\u2019s Jarrett Allen (0 for 4 on 3-pointers), Charlotte\u2019s Mark Williams (0 for 1), New Orleans\u2019 Yves Missi (0 for 1) and Phoenix\u2019s Nick Richards (0 for 2) were close to being on that list.",
      "Oklahoma City\u2019s Isaiah Hartenstein is over the 500-point threshold \u2014 but is 0 for 18 on 3s this season. Only three players have ever tried more 3s in a season without a make; Gene Banks was 0 for 19 in 1985-86, Magic Johnson was 0 for 21 in 1982-83 and Tom Garrick was 0 for 22 in 1990-91.",

    "summary": "In Wayne Gretzky's hometown of Brantford, Ontario, and across Canada, the Great One's loyalty and legacy are being questioned at a time the nation's independence is being threatened by U.S. President Donald Trump",
    "story": [
      "In Wayne Gretzky's hometown of Brantford, Ontario, and across Canada, the Great One's loyalty and legacy are being questioned at a time the nation's independence is being threatened by U.S. President Donald Trump",
      "BRANTFORD, Ontario -- John Davidson has difficulty remembering the last time Wayne Gretzky visited his childhood home across the street in this small city a couple hours' drive southwest of Toronto.",
      "The modestly plain house with a one-car garage in a quiet residential neighborhood remains in the family, but the Great One\u2019s visits have been fewer and farther between, especially since his beloved father Walter died in 2021. The backyard ice rink where Gretzky developed his generational talent has since been replaced by a pool.",
      "Now 85, Davidson still chases away the occasional curiosity seeker, a far cry from the days when busloads of children would pull up, or the time Wayne and his wife Janet showed up with an entourage, three limousines strong. The retired steelworker then lowered his hand to his knee to indicate how long he's known Gretzky, before saying: \u201cWayne\u2019s changed a lot since he went down to the States.\u201d",
      "Like many in this city of 105,000 and across a nation of 39 million, Davidson has difficulty squaring the child he once knew, the player who won four Stanley Cups in Edmonton and re-wrote the NHL\u2019s scoring records, and the person he sees now.",
      "At 64, Gretzky is now the subject of a once-unimaginable debate over his loyalty to his native Canada due to his ties to President Donald Trump, whose brazen comments about the nation's sovereignty have angered Canadians.",
      "Pictures of Gretzky celebrating Trump\u2019s election night victory at Mar-a-Lago and attending his inauguration don\u2019t sit well at a time Canadians face an existential crisis in the wake of rising tariffs and the president\u2019s comments about turning its northern neighbor into a 51st state. Many find it unsettling that Gretzky is silent on the topic, even with Trump suggesting Gretzky run for office for the eventuality of becoming the nation\u2019s governor once it joins the U.S.",
      "\u201cI always thought the hell out of him,\" Davidson said of Gretzky. \"Hate is a terrible word. Dislike is a better word.",
      "\u201cIt disappoints the hell out of me. And I don\u2019t think his father would appreciate it either,\u201d he added. \u201cA lot of people are pissed off with him right now because he went and kissed the ring.\u201d",
      "Gretzky did not respond to messages seeking comment from The Associated Press for this story.",
      "Gretzky's on-ice exploits remain legendary and they begin at an early age. When he was 11, he scored 378 goals and 517 points in 85 games for the atom division Brantford Nadrofsky Steelers. By 13, he had already scored 1,000 goals, and was essentially chased out of Brantford by adults \u2014 even parents of his teammates \u2014 booing Gretzky for the attention he was generating.",
      "His parents relocated him to play in Toronto, before Gretzky made the jump to the Ontario Hockey League, where in his only full season in 1977-78 he scored 70 goals and piled up 182 points, which still ranks second on the league's list.",
      "Though he played on four NHL teams, ending his career with the New York Rangers in 1999, befitting his No. 99, Gretzky is best known for his 10 seasons in Edmonton, including his first when the Oilers played in the World Hockey Association. Gretzky became an icon in Alberta's capital for the championships and attention; his marriage to American actor Janet Jones in July 1988 was called \u201cThe Royal Wedding\u201d and broadcast live across Canada.",
      "Brantford is dubbed \u201cThe Telephone City\u201d for once being home to Alexander Graham Bell, but Gretzky\u2019s influence abounds. His charitable foundation provides for numerous local causes, including Special Olympics and distributing free hockey sticks to children.",
      "Inside the four-rink, two-swimming pool Wayne Gretzky Sports Centre is the region\u2019s sports hall of fame, featuring a large collection of the Great One\u2019s memorabilia. Outside is a statue of Gretzky raising the Stanley Cup with three smaller statues looking on, representing his parents and a young Gretzky wearing a Red Wings' Gordie Howe jersey.",
      "All this in honor of a person who has been gone for a majority of his life, and makes his home in the U.S. Of his five children, daughter Paulina is best known for her marriage to top golfer Dustin Johnson. And while the Gretzkys are a far cry from the Kardashians, there is a Hollywood shine to the family that previously served as a mild curiosity to most Canadians.",
      "It's unclear when Gretzky and Trump became friends, though it likely revolves around golf.",
      "In the 1980s, Oilers players enjoyed occasional rounds of golf with Trump through his friendship with then-franchise owner Peter Pocklington. The relationship between Gretzky and the president likely grew stronger through Johnson, who has often golfed with Trump.",
      "Gretzky's ties with Trump might have raised a few curious head turns in the past, but never approached the turmoil it has reached today.",
      "Recently, CTV reported, the face of Gretzky's statue outside of the Edmonton Oilers arena had been smeared with feces, part of a polarizing debate that's raised ire among his detractors and eye-rolls from his defenders.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s done so many good things in both of these countries, he doesn\u2019t need to explain himself to anybody,\u201d said Brantford councilor Dan McCreary, whose ward includes Gretzky sports complex. He referred to Gretzky's critics as being part of a \u201ccancel culture\u201d movement.",
      "Though no fan of the president, McCreary called it \u201ca deficit of leadership\u201d in equally blaming Trump and former Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau for the fallout.",
      "Not lost on McCreary is how Brantford sits in the crosshairs of the cross-border dispute. The city serves as a transportation hub \u2014 a two-and-a-half-hour drive from three border crossings \u2014 and with a manufacturing base linked to the auto industry, now facing potential fallout from U.S. tariffs.",
      "\u201cYou might suggest that to him,\u201d McCreary said when asked if Gretzky could put in a good word to Trump about his hometown.",
      "The effects of the trade dispute and surge in patriotism are apparent in Brantford. Grocery stores highlight Canadian-made products \u2014 from soup to nuts and maple syrup \u2014 and provincially controlled liquor stores have removed all U.S. wines and whiskeys from their shelves.",
      "Meantime, the Gretzky name is everywhere. Bars feature signed posters. There's a Gretzky party room in a chain restaurant around the corner from his childhood home. There's the Wayne Gretzky Parkway, a winding five-mile, four-lane thoroughfare that's suddenly become a sticking point.",
      "A sense of national pride led to Kat Philp launching a petition to rename the road after Walter, who held the honorary title of Brantford's Lord Mayor for his extensive community work.",
      "The issue is not whose Wayne Gretzky's friends are \u2014 \u201cYou do you,\u201d Philp said. Instead, she feels betrayed by his failure to voice support for Canada.",
      "\u201cWe always felt he was still Canadian. We don\u2019t feel that way anymore,\" said Philp, 50, who grew up playing hockey, attended Gretzky\u2019s celebrity slow-pitch tournaments as a teenager and was proud in telling people she was from Gretzky's hometown.",
      "Pocklington, the former Oilers owner, is stunned by the backlash directed at someone he's known since purchasing the 17-year-old player\u2019s rights in 1978 and bringing him to Edmonton to usher in the franchise's heyday before trading him to Los Angeles.",
      "\"Wayne is not a politician. He\u2019s a hockey player. Period. And his heart has always been in Canada, with Canada,\u201d Pocklington said from his home in Desert Palm, California. \u201cI\u2019m not sure he\u2019d stand up in his own defense but I think he probably feels sorry for them more than anything.\u201d",
      "For all those defending Gretzky, including his wife Janet and Ontario Premier Doug Ford, what\u2019s notable, too, are those who haven\u2019t.",
      "Hockey Hall of Fame goalie Ken Dryden declined an interview request, writing \u201cThis is something Wayne Gretzky needs to think through,\u201d in an email to the AP. Canada-Russia 1972 Summit Series star Paul Henderson laughed, saying he stays out of politics. And there's not been a peep from Mark Messier, Gretzky's former teammate and current TV analyst.",
      "Hall of Fame goalie Dominik Hasek was among the exceptions as the debate over Gretzky\u2019s legacy lingers with Alex Ovechkin closing in on the Great One\u2019s NHL goal-scoring title.",
      "\u201cThe whole world saw Wayne at a party at the American President\u2019s home,\u201d Hasek wrote in a text to the AP from his home in the Czech Republic.",
      "\u201cIt is not surprising to me that Canadian people are asking about the attitude of a man who is a Canadian icon,\u201d Hasek added. \"To be honest, I am also interested in his attitude. He must know best why he does not express himself on this. Be sure to ask him.\u201d",

      "At least four states are considering giving college athletes tax breaks on endorsement income",
      "CHICAGO -- Illinois state Rep. Travis Weaver remembers how surreal it felt having Heisman Trophy winner Mark Ingram sit a few rows behind him in a political science class. He will never forget the pure joy in Alabama every time the Crimson Tide rolled to the national championship, either.",
      "Weaver was there for two title runs as a student from 2010 to 2015. The way he sees it, coach Nick Saban and his players weren't the only winners.",
      "\u201cThe city of Tuscaloosa, the state of Alabama, the employers who recruited the University of Alabama because there\u2019s higher-caliber students there -- they all benefited massively because of the success of the football team,\" Weaver said. \"Coach Saban made that a different school than when he got there. Obviously, the football team was better. But what I saw as a student was an entire community become much stronger because of that success.\u201d",
      "His college experience is driving the push he's now making.",
      "Weaver wants to give an assist to Illinois schools and entice more recruits to stay home by exempting up to $100,000 in name, image and likeness earnings from the state income tax. In Georgia and Alabama, lawmakers are looking to eliminate income tax on NIL earnings altogether. There's a similar push in Louisiana.",
      "Lawmakers see the legislation they are proposing as a way to level the hyper-competitive recruiting field if not gain an advantage. Their universities are going against schools from Florida, Tennessee and Texas, states where income is not taxed.",
      "The measures could face pushback from other students who make money off their name, image and likeness such as social media influencers, actors and musicians. They might wonder why the quarterback and point guard are getting an exemption but not them.",
      "There is precedent. In 2016, President Barack Obama signed a bill that eliminated the so-called federal \u201cvictory tax\u201d on Olympic medalists, preventing the IRS from collecting on medals and prize money up to $1 million. Then again, state lawmakers have to decide if the proposed measures are worth the potential challenges even if they're on solid legal footing.",
      "\u201cThe optics of it probably aren\u2019t great for people that are YouTubers, and some college kids are paying in-state tax and some aren\u2019t,\u201d said Daniel Ryan, a former IRS attorney now at Sullivan and Worcester in Boston. \u201cBut I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s a constitutional issue that would prevent it from happening.\u201d",
      "Attorney Michael Rueda of Withers Worldwide has worked with athletes and schools on NIL matters. He said states would \u201chave to make the argument that there\u2019s a legitimate rationale to distinguish between taxpayers.\u201d",
      "There are nine with no income tax: Alaska, Florida, Nevada, New Hampshire, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Washington and Wyoming. Though the idea of saving money might be attractive, accountants and attorneys who work with athletes and colleges say tax rates generally aren't at the top of their clients\u2019 priority lists. They look more at their role, the team's competitiveness and their marketing opportunities.",
      "In that sense, they're just like the pros.",
      "\u201cWhat seems to be the number one choice for them after you get past the money?\" said Richard Koenigsberg, an accountant at Eisner Advisory Group in New York who has worked with college and professional athletes. \"Because we have seen athletes turn down the highest-priced contract.\u201d",
      "As for a potential exemption on NIL income?",
      "\u201cCarson Beck -- did he go to (Miami) just to avoid Georgia income tax?\" said Michael Guariglia, an attorney with McCarter & English in New Jersey who has worked with colleges on NIL. \"I think it was more important to him to get the assurances that he was going to be their starting quarterback. Could it be a factor? Yeah, maybe. It plays into a lot of different things.\u201d",
      "Recruits from New Jersey, for example, who go to school in Florida still have to pay income tax in their state unless they change residence. And income for someone from Florida who goes to school in Jersey might still be exempt.",
      "Athletes in Georgia, Alabama, Louisiana and, maybe to a lesser extent, Illinois who choose to stay home would be in for a break if the legislation passes.",
      "In Georgia, where there's a flat rate of 5.39%, a recruit who stays in state would figure to save about $5,400 on $100,000 in NIL money. In Alabama \u2014 where it ranges from 2% to 5% for a single earner making more than $3,000 \u2014 the savings on $100,000 would be about $5,000. In Louisiana \u2014 which just implemented a flat 3% rate \u2014 that translates to $3,000.",
      "The savings for athletes making seven figures in NIL money would obviously be much more significant; in Illinois, not as much since Weaver's plan would exempt only the first $100,000.",
      "In that scenario, basketball or football players with their eyes on the NBA or NFL might still wind up paying state tax on at least a portion of their NIL earnings. Athletes with less lucrative deals might be completely covered and a little more inclined to stay in state as a result.",
      "To Weaver, it's more about helping the mid-major schools in the state such as Bradley, Illinois State, Western Illinois and Loyola Chicago than the Big Ten's Illinois and Northwestern.",
      "\u201cIf those schools are just a little bit more successful and you get that extra 10% bump in applications more periodically, they can help Peoria, Ill., Bloomington, Ill., Macomb, Ill.,\" said Weaver, a Republican from Peoria.",
      "Though Weaver said the state would lose about $750,000 in income tax revenue, he considers it a worthwhile investment. He envisions increases in enrollment, attendance at games, merchandise sales, hotel bookings and more that come with success on the court and field.",
      "Exhibit A: Loyola.",
      "The Jesuit school on Chicago's North Side saw big jumps in applications and merchandise sales following runs to the Final Four in 2018 and Sweet 16 in 2021. Sister Jean bobbleheads and maroon-and-gold scarves became popular items.",
      "\u201cIf we can help -- you pick the mid-major -- make the NCAA Tournament once every three years instead of once every five years, and that means twice as often they\u2019re getting that 10% boost in applications, that could be something that really is a difference maker in keeping one of those smaller schools afloat for the long term,\u201d Weaver said.",

      "Since the plane crash that killed his parents, figure skater Maxim Naumov has become in many ways the face of the tragedy",
      "BOSTON -- Maxim Naumov came to a stop in the middle of the ice, looked up at the sky and patted his heart. Then he mouthed a few words, in Russian, to his parents:",
      "\u201cThis is for you guys. You guys are with me. I love you both.\u201d",
      "Former world pairs champions Vadim Naumov and Evgenia Shishkova died in January when their plane crashed into a military helicopter on approach to Washington, D.C., and fell into the icy Potomac River. A total of 67 people were killed, including more than two dozen who were returning from a development camp following the U.S. figure skating championships in Wichita, Kansas.",
      "Maxim Naumov, who finished fourth at nationals, already had returned home. Since the crash, he has become in many ways the face of the tragedy \u2014 or at least its effect on the skating community.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve walked through a hallway and haven\u2019t given a hug since. And I feel that support and love,\u201d he said Sunday. \u201cIt\u2019s been beyond anything that I could have ever even imagined. And it helps so much to get through this day.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s overwhelming,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it makes my heart so full.\u201d",
      "Naumov, 23, skated in a benefit in Washington earlier this month that raised more than $1.2 million for the victims\u2019 families. Speaking to reporters Sunday after performing at the world championships gala, Naumov said the time that he is on the ice gives his mind a chance to escape the tragedy.",
      "\u201cAs soon as I hit the ice, my brain just \u2014 I don\u2019t know whether it\u2019s focus or just calmness or stillness or what, but it feels like I tune everything out,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m just talking with them, and they\u2019re helping me.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t hear the crowd. I don\u2019t hear the announcers, I don\u2019t hear anything. I just have this internal dialogue and I\u2019m just able to almost be calm and just be in my heart,\u201d Naumov said. \u201cAnd they\u2019re always there, too. And every time I think of them, especially when I\u2019m on the ice, it really, really helps me get through.\u201d",
      "The world championships, which had previously been scheduled at the home of Boston's Celtics and Bruins, brought renewed attention to the plane crash and the century-old Skating Club of Boston that has been a home for Olympians and recreational skaters alike.",
      "There was a tribute on Wednesday, sandwiched between the day's two sessions, and frequent reminders of the tragedy.",
      "Alisa Efimova and Misha Mitrofanov, who finished sixth in pairs this weekend, held up pictures of the Boston club members who died in the crash: two young skaters, their mothers and the two coaches. Reigning U.S. champion Amber Glenn wore a T-shirt honoring the memory of all the young skaters who were lost.",
      "Ilia Malinin, the \u201cQuad God\u201d who won his second straight world championship on Saturday night, finished the show on Sunday with a performance that he said was dedicated to the plane crash victims. He came to the end, red-eyed and choking back tears.",
      "Naumov\u2019s introduction on Sunday identified him as a member of the Boston club and included his three fourth-place finishes at nationals. It didn\u2019t mention the crash, but many in the crowd surely knew his connection: He received not only the polite applause that greeted most of the other skaters, but a second wave, with individuals standing to cheer him on.",
      "Wearing unadorned black pants and a sparkly black top, a gold chain flopping around his neck as he glided across the ice, Naumov gave a gala performance aimed more at emotion than proof of athletic prowess.",
      "The choice of music, Mac Miller\u2019s posthumous 2020 release \u201cThat\u2019s on Me,\u201d was intentional. Miller died of an accidental drug overdose in 2018.",
      "\u201cLately, for some reason \u2014 well, not for some reason \u2014 but lately I\u2019ve just been listening to Mac Miller\u2019s album \u2018Circles.\u2019 Like just over and over and over,\u201d Naumov said. \u201cAnd knowing the unfortunate story about him as an artist, it\u2019s been very relatable.",
      "\u201cI relate to it, and I feel really deeply and emotionally what he\u2019s talking about in those songs. And it\u2019s also been really helpful for me to almost get my emotions out in that way personally.\u201d",
      "When his skate was over, Naumov took a deep breath, patted his heart again and waved in each direction. His bows were deep and poignant. Leaving the ice after a one-minute standing ovation, he made the sign of the cross.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of emotions just right now, and it\u2019s hard to even put a name to what I\u2019m feeling currently,\" he said. \"I just feel so much support, and it\u2019s very overwhelming.",
      "\u201cI have so much gratitude,\" Naumov said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m thankful for each and every single one of those fans.\u201d",

      "LONDON -- A volcano began erupting in southwestern Iceland on Tuesday, just hours after authorities evacuated a nearby community and a geothermal spa, one of Iceland\u2019s biggest tourist attractions.",
      "Flames and smoke shot through the air as the volcanic fissure opened near the town of Grindavik, where some 40 homes have been evacuated, national broadcaster RUV reported. The community, located on the Reykjanes Peninsula, was largely evacuated a year ago when the volcano came to life after lying dormant for 800 years.",

      "In response, TVA has noted that the CEO pay ranks in the bottom quartile of the power industry. Lyash\u2019s total compensation topped $10.5 million in the 2024 budget year, including various pension and performance incentives worth millions of dollars. Additionally, the utility has stressed that it doesn\u2019t receive federal taxpayer money and instead is funded by electricity customers.",

      "If their injuries aren't too severe, victims can survive for a week or more, assuming the weather isn't too hot or cold, experts say.",
      "Rescue teams in Myanmar and Thailand are searching for survivors after Friday's 7.7 magnitude quake that toppled buildings and damaged roads. The disaster has killed more than 2,000 people in Myanmar and at least 18 in Thailand, mainly at a Bangkok office tower construction site.",
      "Most rescues happen in the 24 hours after a disaster. The chances of survival drop with each day after that, experts say. Most victims are badly injured or buried by falling stones or other debris.",
      "Trapped victims are more likely to survive if they are in a debris-free pocket that prevents major injury while they await rescue, like under a sturdy desk, said geophysicist Victor Tsai from Brown University in an email. Experts call this a survivable void space.",
      "If fire, smoke or hazardous chemicals were released as a result of the building collapse, they may decrease a person's survival odds, said emergency response expert Dr. Joseph Barbera, an associate professor at George Washington University.",
      "Beyond that, having air to breathe and water to drink are crucial as the days go on.",
      "\u201cYou could survive a while without food,\u201d Barbera said. \u201cYou could survive less without water.\u201d",
      "Temperatures where someone is trapped may affect survival, and temperatures outside the rubble can affect rescue missions.",
      "Power outages and spotty communications have slowed relief operations in Myanmar, where many are searching for survivors by hand in daily temperatures above 40 degrees Celsius (104 Fahrenheit). A lack of heavy machinery has slowed search-and-rescue efforts.",
      "It can be important for survivors to receive vital medical care before they are removed from the rubble, Barbera said. If not, the buildup of toxins from crushed muscles could make them go into shock after they are rescued.",
      "After the 2011 earthquake and tsunami in Japan, a teenager and his 80-year-old grandmother were found alive after nine days trapped in their flattened home. And the year before, a 16-year-old Haitian girl was rescued from earthquake rubble in Port-Au-Prince after 15 days.",
      "The best practices for survival during an earthquake depend on where you are in the world. Building codes in regions with active fault lines are often designed to withstand earthquakes, but that doesn't hold true everywhere.",
      "In many countries, including the United States, the best practices are to drop, seek cover and hang on unless you are close to a building exit. Seek shelter under a heavy table or near sturdy furniture that may yield a survivable pocket if the roof collapses. Cover your face with cloth or a mask to protect from dust and debris.",
      "If you are trapped in the rubble after and earthquake, save your energy and don't overexert. Ration food and water, listen for rescue calls and search for something near you to make noise. If you have a phone with you, conserve its battery and try for help in short spurts each day.",

But rather than rely on a standard AI computer vision model that could run any visual data, they had to build a customized version specific to Mandalay.",
      "\u201cThe Earth is too different, the natural disasters are too different and the imagery we get from satellites is just too different to work in every situation,\u201d Lavista Ferres said. For instance, he said, while fires spread in fairly predictable ways, \u201can earthquake touches the whole city\u201d and it can be harder to know in the immediate aftermath where help is needed.",
      "Once the AI analysis was complete, it showed 515 buildings in Mandalay with 80% to 100% damage and another 1,524 with between 20% and 80% damage. That showed the widespread gravity of the disaster, but, just as important, it helps pinpoint specific locations of damage.",
      "\u201cThis is critical information for teams on the ground,\u201d Lavista Ferres said.",

      "Dubbed the wooly devil, the flower with furry leaves, purplish-striped petals and pops of yellow is a new genus and species in the same family as sunflowers and daisies: Asteraceae. It was discovered last year in Big Bend National Park, known for its rugged terrain of desert, canyons and mountains, on the border with Mexico.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a lot to learn with this species so they\u2019re really just getting started,\u201d said Carolyn Whiting, a Big Bend botanist.",
      "Scientists are hopeful the flowers will bloom again after rain fell on the drought-stricken park last week, giving them the opportunity to learn more including when the plants germinate, Whiting said.",
      "The flower was discovered in March 2024. Park volunteer Deb Manley and a park ranger were hiking in a remote area when they saw a patch of flowers that were smaller than a quarter and close to the ground.",
      "\u201cWe stopped and took some photos and neither one of us had any idea,\u201d Manley said. \u201cI could get it to family but I couldn\u2019t figure out any more than that. So we took photos and moved on, not realizing we had found a new genus.\u201d",

      "The wooly devil's official name \u2014 Ovicula biradiata \u2014 takes inspiration from its appearance: Ovicula, which means tiny sheep, is a nod to the hairs that cover its leaves; while biradiata, or bi-radial, refers to its two striped petals.",

      "PARIS -- France\u2019s antitrust watchdog fined Apple 150 million euros ($162 million) on Monday over a privacy feature protecting users from apps snooping on them because its introduction resulted in abuse of competition law.",
      "The French Competition Authority said the aim of Apple\u2019s App Tracking Transparency (ATT) requiring iPhone and iPad apps to ask users for permission before tracking them was not in itself open to criticism.",
      "But it ruled that the \u201cway in which it was implemented was neither necessary nor proportionate to Apple\u2019s stated objective of protecting personal data.\u201d",
      "Apple rolled out ATT starting in April 2021 as part of an update to the operating system powering the iPhone and iPad. The feature forces apps to obtain permission before collecting data to target users with personalized ads. While the feature was designed to tighten up privacy, it faced criticism from Big Tech rivals that it would make it harder for smaller apps to survive without charging consumers.",
      "The fine, punishing Apple for abuse of its dominant position in mobile app distribution, covers the period from April 2021 to July 2023. But the amount is a pittance for the iPhone maker, which earned $124 billion in revenue in the final three months of last year.",
      "The watchdog said the feature's rollout resulted in users being barraged by pop-ups from third-party apps requesting their consent. It bemoaned how the proliferation of these consent windows made it \"excessively complex\" for app users to navigate the iOS environment.",
      "It also questioned the system\u2019s neutrality, saying it penalized the smallest publishers, which depend to a large extent on the collection of third-party data to finance their activity.",
      "Apple said in a statement that ATT gives users more privacy control \u201cthrough a required, clear, and easy-to-understand prompt about one thing: tracking.\u201d",
      "\u201cThat prompt is consistent for all developers, including Apple, and we have received strong support for this feature from consumers, privacy advocates, and data protection authorities around the world,\u201d the company said. \"While we are disappointed with today\u2019s decision, the French Competition Authority (FCA) has not required any specific changes to ATT.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "There is plenty of nostalgia at Black Mountain, New Hampshire's oldest ski area",
      "Jackson, N.H. -- A skier since age 4, Thomas Brennick now enjoys regular trips to New Hampshire\u2019s Black Mountain with his two grandchildren.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s back to the old days,\u201d he said from the Summit Double chairlift on a recent sunny Friday. \u201cIt's just good, old-time skiing at its best.\u201d",
      "Behind the scenes, the experience is now propelled by a high-tech system designed to increase efficiency at the state\u2019s oldest ski area. And while small, independent resorts can\u2019t compete on infrastructure or buying power with conglomerates like Vail, which owns nearby Attitash Mountain Resort and seven others in the Northeast alone, at least one entrepreneur is betting technology will be \u201ca really great equalizer.\u201d",
      "That businessman is Erik Mogensen, who bought Black Mountain last year and turned it into a lab for his ski mountain consultancy, Entabeni Systems. The company builds systems that put lift tickets sales, lesson reservations and equipment rentals online while collecting detailed data to inform decisions such as where to make more snow and how much.",
      "\u201cA lot of general managers will go out and look at how many rows of cars are parked, and that\u2019s kind of how they tell how busy they are,\u201d Mogensen said. \u201cWe really want to look at that transactional data down to the deepest level.\u201d",
      "That includes analyzing everything from the most popular time to sell hot dogs in the lodge to how many runs a season pass holder makes per visit.",
      "\u201cThe large operators, they can do a lot of things at scale that we can\u2019t. They can buy 20 snow cats at a time, 10 chairlifts, those types of things. We can\u2019t do that, but we\u2019re really nimble,\u201d Mogensen said. \u201cWe can decide to change the way we groom very quickly, or change the way we open trails, or change our (food and beverage) menu in the middle of a day.\u201d",
      "Mogensen, who says his happiest moments are tied to skiing, started Entabeni Systems in 2015, driven by the desire to keep the sport accessible. In 2023, he bought the company Indy Pass, which allows buyers to ski for two days each at 230 independent ski areas, including Black Mountain. It's an alternative to the Epic and Ikon multi-resort passes offered by the Vail and Alterra conglomerates.",
      "Black Mountain was an early participant in Indy Pass. When Mogensen learned it was in danger of closing, he was reminded of his hometown's long-gone ski area. He bought Black Mountain aiming to ultimately transform it into a cooperative.",
      "Many Indy Pass resorts also are clients of Entabeni Systems, including Utah's Beaver Mountain, which bills itself as the longest continuously-run family owned mountain resort in the U.S.",
      "Kristy Seeholzer, whose husband\u2019s grandfather founded Beaver Mountain, said Entabeni streamlined its ticketing and season pass system. That led to new, lower-priced passes for those willing to forgo skiing during holiday weeks or weekends, she said.",
      "\u201cA lot of our season pass holders were self-limiting anyway. They only want to ski weekdays because they don\u2019t want to deal with weekends,\u201d she said. \u201cWe could never have kept track of that manually.\"",
      "Though she is pleased overall, Seeholzer said the software can be challenging and slow.",
      "\u201cThere are some really great programs out there, like on the retail side of things or the sales side of things. And one of the things that was a little frustrating was it felt like we were reinventing the wheel,\u201d she said.",
      "Sam Shirley, 25, grew up skiing in New Hampshire and worked as a ski instructor and ski school director in Maine while attending college. But he said increasing technology has drastically changed the way he skis, pushing him to switch mostly to cross-country.",
      "\u201cAs a customer, it\u2019s made things more complicated,\u201d he said. \"It just becomes an extra hassle.\u201d",
      "Shirley used to enjoy spur-of-the-moment trips around New England, but has been put off by ski areas reserving lower rates for those who buy tickets ahead. He doesn\u2019t like having to provide detailed contact information, sometimes even a photograph, just to get a lift ticket.",
      "It's not just independent ski areas that are focused on technology and data. Many others are using lift tickets and passes embedded with radio frequency identification chips that track skiers' movements.",
      "Vail resorts pings cell phones to better understand how lift lines are forming, which informs staffing decisions, said John Plack, director of communications. Lift wait times have decreased each year for the past three years, with 97% under 10 minutes this year, he said.",
      "\u201cOur company is a wildly data-driven company. We know a lot about our guest set. We know their tastes. We know what they like to ski, we know when they like to ski. And we\u2019re able to use that data to really improve the guest experience,\u201d he said.",
      "That improvement comes at a cost. A one-day lift ticket at Vail's Keystone Resort in Colorado sold for $292 last week. A season pass cost $418, a potentially good deal for diehard skiers, but also a reliable revenue stream guaranteeing Vail a certain amount of income even as ski areas face less snow and shorter winters.",
      "The revenue from such passes, especially the multi-resort Epic Pass, allowed the company to invest $100 million in snowmaking, Plack said.",
      "\u201cBy committing to the season ahead of time, that gives us certainty and allows us to reinvest in our resorts,\" he said.",
      "Mogensen insists bigger isn\u2019t always better, however. Lift tickets at Black Mountain cost $59 to $99 per day and a season's pass is about $450.",
      "\u201cYou don\u2019t just come skiing to turn left and right. You come skiing because of the way the hot chocolate tastes and the way the fire pit smells and what spring skiing is and what the beer tastes like and who you\u2019re around,\u201d he said. \u201cSkiing doesn\u2019t have to be a luxury good. It can be a community center.\u201d",
      "Brennick, the Black Mountain lift rider who was skiing with his grandchildren, said he has noticed a difference since the ski area was sold.",
      "\u201cI can see the change,\u201d he said. \u201cThey're making a lot of snow and it shows.\u201d",

      "In his letter, which was obtained by The Associated Press, Marks said he was \u201cwilling to work\u201d to address the concerns expressed by Robert F. Kennedy Jr., about the safety of vaccinations. But he concluded that wasn't possible.",
      "\u201cIt has become clear that truth and transparency are not desired by the Secretary, but rather he wishes subservient confirmation of his misinformation and lies,\u201d he wrote.",
      "The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "Marks was offered the choice of resigning or being fired by Kennedy, according to a former FDA official familiar with the discussions, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he didn\u2019t have permission to discuss the matter publicly.",
      "Kennedy has a long history of spreading anti-vaccine misinformation, although during his Senate confirmation hearings he seemed to say he would not undermine vaccines. He promised the chair of the Senate health committee that he would not change existing vaccine recommendations.",
      "Since becoming commissioner, Kennedy has vowed to scrutinize the safety of childhood vaccinations, despite decades of evidence they are safe and have saved millions of lives.",
      "Marks oversaw the agency\u2019s rapid review and approval of COVID-19 vaccines and treatments during the pandemic.",
      "Marks is credited with coining the name and concept for \u201cOperation Warp Speed,\u201d the effort under President Donald Trump to rapidly manufacture vaccines while they were still being tested for safety and efficacy. The initiative cut years off the normal development process.",
      "Despite the project\u2019s success, Trump repeatedly lashed out at the FDA for not approving the first COVID shots even sooner. Trump told confidants after his 2020 loss that he would have been re-elected if the vaccine had been available before Election Day.",
      "Dr. Paul Offit, a vaccine expert at Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia, criticized what he called the \u201cfiring\u201d of Marks.",
      "\u201cRFK Jr.\u2019s firing of Peter Marks because he wouldn\u2019t bend a knee to his misinformation campaign now allows the fox to guard the hen house,\" Offit said. \u201cIt\u2019s a sad day for America\u2019s children.\u201d",
      "Former FDA Commissioner Dr. Robert Califf said the issues raised in Marks' resignation letter \u201cshould be frightening to anyone committed to the importance of evidence to guide policies and patient decisions.\u201d",
      "\u201cI hope this will intensify the communication across academia, industry and government to bolster the importance of science and evidence,\u201d he wrote.",
      "The resignation follows news Friday that HHS plans to lay off 10,000 workers and shut down entire agencies, including ones that oversee billions of dollars in funds for addiction services and community health centers across the country.",
      "In a post on social media Thursday, Kennedy criticized the department he oversees as an inefficient \u201csprawling bureaucracy.\" He also faulted the department\u2019s 82,000 workers for a decline in Americans\u2019 health.",
      "The resignation is the latest blow to the beleaguered health agency, which has been rocked for weeks by layoffs, retirements and a chaotic return-to-office process that left many staffers without permanent offices, desks or other supplies. Last month, Jim Jones, the FDA\u2019s deputy commissioner for foods, resigned, citing \u201cthe indiscriminate firing\u201d of nearly 90 staffers in his division, according to a copy of his resignation letter obtained by the AP.",
      "Marks, who could not be reached for comment, also raised concerns in his letter about \u201cefforts currently being advanced by some on the adverse health effects of vaccination are concerning\u201d as well as the \u201cunprecedented assault on scientific truth that has adversely impacted public health in our nation.\u201d",
      "He went on to detail the historic benefits of vaccinations dating back to George Washington and pointed to the ongoing measles outbreak as proof of what can happen when doubts about science take hold.",
      "\u201cThe ongoing multistate measles outbreak that is particularly severe in Texas reminds us of what happens when confidence in well-established science underlying public health and well-being is undermined,\u201d he wrote.",
      "The measles outbreak, which could go on for months, has now spread to Kansas and Ohio after sickening more than 370 in Texas and New Mexico.",
      "If it hits other unvaccinated communities across the U.S., as may now be the case in Kansas, the outbreak could endure for a year and threaten the nation\u2019s status as having eliminated the local spread of the vaccine-preventable disease, public health experts said.",

      "A major 7.7 magnitude earthquake that originated near Mandalay, Myanmar shook the Earth as far as Bangkok",
      "Early Friday, a major 7.7 magnitude earthquake that originated near Mandalay, Myanmar, shook the Earth as far as Bangkok, about 800 miles (1,300 kilometers) away.",
      "Two hard-hit cities in Myanmar suffered extensive damage, with images from the capital, Naypyidaw, showing rescue crews pulling victims from the rubble of collapsed buildings. Authorities in Bangkok said deaths had occurred at three construction sites, including a high-rise that collapsed.",
      "Experts say the earthquake, which occurred along the Sagaing Fault, was close to the Earth's surface, generating intense seismic forces. Preliminary estimates by the U.S. Geological Survey show that nearly 800,000 people in Myanmar may have been within the zone of the most violent shaking and that death tolls exceeding 1,000 people, and perhaps much higher, are probable.",
      "The Earth's crust is broken up into several pieces called tectonic plates, which fit together like a jigsaw puzzle.",
      "This formation is \u201cmostly stable, but along the edges they are moving,\u201d Columbia University geophysicist Michael Steckler said.",
      "Pressure builds up when sliding plates get stuck, increasing \u201cvery slowly for decades or for hundreds of years, and then all of a sudden the rock plates will jump,\" triggering shaking that causes an earthquake, Steckler said.",
      "Earthquakes typically occur along edges of tectonic plates. But their impacts may be felt in a broader region.",
      "Earthquakes that occur in the ocean don't always attract attention, but those that occur close to where people live can cause deaths and injuries, most often from collapsed buildings.",
      "Scientists have a good idea of where earthquakes are likely to occur, \"but we can't predict when they'll occur,\u201d USGS seismologist Will Yeck said.",
      "However, after the initial big earthquake, researchers are able to project that other smaller earthquakes nearby, called aftershocks, are likely.",
      "Aftershocks are triggered \u201cbecause of changes to stress in the Earth from the main shock,\u201d Yeck said.",
      "Given the magnitude of the quake in Myanmar, \u201cyou will probably see aftershocks for the next several months,\u201d Steckler said.",
      "In regions of the world with known active fault lines, including California and Japan, building codes are often designed to withstand earthquakes. But that's not true everywhere.",
      "\u201cIf you feel shaking, the guidance depends on where you are in the world,\u201d Yeck said.",
      "In many countries, including the United States, if you're inside when an earthquake occurs, it's advisable to drop to the ground, cover your head \u2014 for example, by crawling under a desk or other sturdy structure \u2014 and hold onto that structure, he said. Try to avoid areas near glass windows and don't use building elevators.",

      "The drone will deliver infrared images, among other things, and works in combination with a fire detection system that the company developed earlier and that's already being used in several countries.

      "LOS ANGELES -- Fans of Studio Ghibli, the famed Japanese animation studio behind \u201cSpirited Away\u201d and other beloved movies, were delighted this week when a new version of ChatGPT let them transform popular internet memes or personal photos into the distinct style of Ghibli founder Hayao Miyazaki.",
      "But the trend also highlighted ethical concerns about artificial intelligence tools trained on copyrighted creative works and what that means for the future livelihoods of human artists. Miyazaki, 84, known for his hand-drawn approach and whimsical storytelling, has expressed skepticism about AI's role in animation.",
      "Janu Lingeswaran wasn't thinking much about that when he uploaded a photo of his 3-year-old ragdoll cat, Mali, into ChatGPT's new image generator tool on Wednesday. He then asked ChatGPT to convert it to the Ghibli style, instantly making an anime image that looked like Mali but also one of the painstakingly drawn feline characters that populate Miyazaki movies such as \u201cMy Neighbor Totoro\u201d or \u201cKiki's Delivery Service.\u201d",
      "\u201cI really fell in love with the result,\u201d said Lingeswaran, an entrepreneur who lives near Aachen, Germany. \u201cWe're thinking of printing it out and hanging it on the wall.\u201d",
      "Similar results gave the Ghibli style to iconic images, such as the casual look of Turkish pistol shooter Yusuf Dikec in a T-shirt and one hand in his pocket on his way to winning a silver medal at the 2024 Olympics. Or the famed \u201cDisaster Girl\u201d meme of a 4-year-old turning to the camera with a slight smile as a house fire rages in the background.",
      "ChatGPT maker OpenAI, which is fighting copyright lawsuits over its flagship chatbot, has largely encouraged the \u201cGhiblification\u201d experiments and its CEO Sam Altman changed his profile on social media platform X into a Ghibli-style portrait. In a technical paper posted Tuesday, the company had said the new tool would be taking a \u201cconservative approach\u201d in the way it mimics the aesthetics of individual artists.",
      "\u201cWe added a refusal which triggers when a user attempts to generate an image in the style of a living artist,\u201d it said. But the company added in a statement that it \u201cpermits broader studio styles \u2014 which people have used to generate and share some truly delightful and inspired original fan creations.\u201d",
      "Studio Ghibli in Japan declined to comment Friday.",
      "As users posted their Ghibli-style images on social media, Miyazaki\u2019s previous comments on AI animation also began to resurface. When Miyazaki was shown an AI demo in 2016, he said he was \u201cutterly disgusted\u201d by the display, according to documentary footage of the interaction. The person demonstrating the animation, which showed a writhing body dragging itself by its head, explained that AI could \u201cpresent us grotesque movements that we humans can\u2019t imagine.\u201d It could be used for zombie movements, the person said.",
      "That prompted Miyazaki to tell a story.",
      "\u201cEvery morning, not in recent days, I see my friend who has a disability,\u201d Miyazaki said. \u201cIt\u2019s so hard for him just to do a high five; his arm with stiff muscle can\u2019t reach out to my hand. Now, thinking of him, I can\u2019t watch this stuff and find it interesting. Whoever creates this stuff has no idea what pain is.\u201d",
      "He said he would \u201cnever wish to incorporate this technology into my work at all.\u201d",
      "\u201cI strongly feel that this is an insult to life itself,\u201d he added.",
      "Josh Weigensberg, a partner at the law firm Pryor Cashman, said that one question the Ghibli-style AI art raises is whether the AI model was trained on Miyazaki or Studio Ghibli\u2019s work. That in turn \u201craises the question of, \u2018Well, do they have a license or permission to do that training or not?\u2019\u201d he said.",
      "OpenAI didn\u2019t respond to a question Thursday about whether it had a license.",
      "Weigensberg added that if a work was licensed for training, it might make sense for a company to permit this type of use. But if this type of use is happening without consent and compensation, he said, it could be \u201cproblematic.\u201d",
      "Weigensberg said that there is a general principle \u201cat the 30,000-foot view\u201d that \u201cstyle\u201d is not copyrightable. But sometimes, he said, what people are actually thinking of when they say \u201cstyle\u201d could be \"more specific, discernible, discrete elements of a work of art,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cA \u2018Howl\u2019s Moving Castle' or \u2018Spirited Away,\u2019 you could freeze a frame in any of those films and point to specific things, and then look at the output of generative AI and see identical elements or substantially similar elements in that output,\u201d he said. \u201cJust stopping at, \u2018Oh, well, style isn\u2019t protectable under copyright law.\u2019 That's not necessarily the end of the inquiry.\u201d",
      "Artist Karla Ortiz, who grew up watching Miyazaki\u2019s movies and is suing other AI image generators for copyright infringement in a case that\u2019s still pending, called it \u201canother clear example of how companies like OpenAI just do not care about the work of artists and the livelihoods of artists.\u201d",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s using Ghibli\u2019s branding, their name, their work, their reputation, to promote (OpenAI) products,\u201d Ortiz said. \u201cIt\u2019s an insult. It\u2019s exploitation.\u201d",
      "Ortiz was further enraged when President Donald Trump\u2019s administration jumped into the meme trend Thursday, using the White House\u2019s official X account to post a Ghibli-style image of a weeping woman from the Dominican Republic recently arrested by U.S. immigration agents. The White House and OpenAI didn\u2019t immediately respond to requests for comment on how the image was made.",
      "\u201cTo see something so brilliant, as wonderful as Miyazaki\u2019s work be butchered to generate something so foul,\u201d Ortiz wrote on social media, adding that she hoped Studio Ghibli sues \u201cthe hell out of\u201d OpenAI for this.",

      "The governing body of figure skating has embarked on an ambitious plan called \u201cVision 2030,\u201d and the idea is simple: Make the sport cool again",
      "BOSTON -- Ashley Wagner and Ben Agosto know what it's like to step off the ice at the figure skating world championships and feel as though they've conquered the sport. And what it feels like when the notoriously fickle sport bites back.",
      "So when the International Skating Union put in motion its ambitious \u201cVision 2030\u201d plan, which is designed to grow and expand the sport through improved fan engagement, it made sense that they would call Wagner, a three-time U.S. champion and former world silver medalist, and Agosto, who won an Olympic silver medal with ice dance partner Tanith Belbin.",
      "If anyone was going to interview athletes at this week's world championships at such an emotionally raw moment, the minute after their programs have concluded, it ought to be someone who has been through it themselves.",
      "\u201cI would have loved this when I was an athlete, to have the post-skate interviews right in the kiss-and-cry, when the emotions are so fresh,\u201d Wagner said. \u201cThat's something being brought into this production. We've never seen anything like it.\u201d",
      "Look closely, and you might notice a lot of things never seen before at this week's worlds: cutting-edge LED dasher boards surrounding the rink, grand entrances for the athletes, and more energetic music \u2014 like the rocked-out version of \u201cI'm Shipping Up to Boston\u201d by the Celtic punk band Dropkick Murphys that keeps blaring inside TD Garden.",
      "The idea is simple: The ISU wants to make figure skating feel cool again.",
      "Or at least, cool to more people.",
      "Those who love the intricate, nuanced sport \u2014 the spins and jumps, the brilliant landings and bitter falls \u2014 tend to follow it year-round. But there are just as many fans that tune in once every four years, during the Winter Olympics, when like a shooting star the athletes spring onto the public consciousness and then fizzle as soon as it ends.",
      "\"Skaters are the reason why this sport exits,\" explained ISU president Jae Youl Kim, who granted The Associated Press a behind-the-scenes tour of the world championship setup Thursday, shortly before the start of the men's short program.",
      "\u201cWe are so proud of our athletes and we want to make sure we shine a brighter, stronger spotlight on our skaters.\u201d",
      "That is why those brilliant LED dasher boards are showcasing each athlete's social media tag, and why each is being introduced individually for the first time, something track and field and other Olympic sports have embraced over the years.",
      "The ISU wants to create a spectacle for the 14,000-plus fans in the arena, along with the millions watching around the world.",
      "\u201cThere's much more to come. I mean, we can brainstorm here a lot about potential marketing and sponsorship activations as well,\u201d said Wieland L\u00fcders, who manages the world championships for the ISU. \u201cEach skater has their own partners, potentially, so there are many more thoughts. But for now, we are just at the beginning. This is the basic concept.\u201d",
      "In the future, the Vision 2030 plan hopes to improve the TV presentation, simplify the sport\u2019s complex rules, increase sponsorship and expand revenue streams. It will also promote skating through grassroots initiatives, reimagine the season-long calendar, and explore new technology that could help to usher the sport into the modern era.",
      "The athletes aren't just benefiting from increased exposure, and the potential boon for their pocketbooks, but also from back-of-the-house upgrades that are a part of Vision 2030. In Boston, an expansive lounge is off limits to everyone but competitors, and back at their hotel, there is a calming room complete with a rotating cast of therapy dogs.",
      "Kim visited it this week. Nobody paid any attention to the ISU president because everybody wanted to see Penny, the dog.",
      "If the calming room is meant to destress, the new hot seat in the arena will probably do the exact opposite.",
      "Much like the time trial in Olympic cycling, where the leader sits uncomfortably on a throne until someone else takes the lead, the ISU has created the same thing at the world championships. But rather than some roped-off backstage area, where leaders have waited for decades, the hot seat is right next to the kiss-and-cry area in the heart of the arena.",
      "The athletes who are coming off the ice after their performance can't help but stare down whomever is in the lead.",
      "\u201cWe want the fans to see how that person is reacting when he or she climbs over to take the throne, or how they are reacting when they cannot make it,\u201d L\u00fcders said. \u201cThey could have interactions with each other, some hugging or high-fives, something like this. So we hope we get more engagement between the two skaters.\u201d",
      "Ultimately, more engagement with the fans, too.",

The immediate approval under President Donald Trump serves as a far-different starting point for his government's relations with Qatar \u2014 particularly after he initially backed a four-nation boycott of Doha during his first term.",

      "Qatar's government did not immediately respond to a request for comment Thursday. Qatar is the second-largest purchaser of U.S. military equipment after Saudi Arabia, spending over $26 billion for F-15 fighter jets, Apache attack helicopters, missile defense systems and other gear.",
      "The proposed sale now goes to the U.S. Congress. Lawmakers typically weigh in on such sales and, in some cases, can block them.",

      "General Atomics Reapers, which cost around $30 million apiece, can fly at altitudes over 40,000 feet (12,100 meters) and have an endurance of more than 30 hours before needing to land. The aircraft have been flown by both the U.S. military and the CIA over the Middle East for years, in Afghanistan, Iraq and now over Yemen during the American bombing campaign there. The drone has a land and sea version.",
      "The initial approval for Qatar, however, comes after the nearby United Arab Emirates has been waiting since 2020 to purchase up to 18 MQ-9 drones as part of a $23 billion deal also including advanced F-35 fighter jets.

      "Democratic-backed Dane County Judge Susan Crawford will win the hot-button Supreme Court race in Wisconsin, The Associated Press projected Tuesday. The race was seen as a barometer on how Americans are feeling at this point in President Donald Trump's second term",
      "While the race is technically nonpartisan, it became the center of a political firestorm, as well as the target of millions spent by groups linked to tech billionaire and key Trump adviser Elon Musk, who supported Republican-backed Brad Schimel.",
      "ABC affiliate WISN reported Tuesday evening that election officials in Milwaukee said there are ballot shortages at some polling sites in the city because of \"historic turnout,\" but that voters should stay in line and that staff are working on getting resources to the impacted polling places.",
      "In a victory speech to supporters, Crawford acknowledged the immense attention and money that the race for control of the court attracted, particularly from Musk.",
      "\u201cI've got to tell you, as a little girl growing up in Chippewa Falls, I never could have imagined that I'd be taking on the richest man in the world for justice in Wisconsin, and we won,\u201d she said. \u201cSo today, Wisconsinites fended off an unprecedented attack on our democracy, our fair elections, and our Supreme Court. And Wisconsin stood up and said loudly that justice does not have a price. Our courts are not for sale.\"",
      "Schimel supporters shouted \"No!\" when he told them he had called Crawford to concede, but he said, \u201cNo, no, no, no, you\u2019ve got to accept the results ... I\u2019m not up here making any joke. The numbers aren\u2019t gonna turn around. They\u2019re too bad and we\u2019re not going to pull this off.\u201d",
      "Asked earlier Tuesday what it would mean if Musk\u2019s efforts worked, Crawford said, \u201cWell, I think it'll be a sad day for democracy\u2026 but I'm pretty confident that voters are going to see through those tactics, and that we will have a successful day.\u201d",
      "Crawford and Schimel were vying to replace retiring Justice Ann Walsh Bradley, and her apparent victory will cement the court's liberal leaning.",
      "\"This is playing out like a presidential-style election. You turn on your TV, any local broadcast station here across the state of Wisconsin, you are inundated with political-type ads for what is technically a nonpartisan judicial race, but this is a full-on political race \u2026 this is becoming a true litmus test for the first 100 days of the Trump administration,\" Matt Smith, political director at Milwaukee's ABC affiliate WISN-TV, told ABC News Live anchor Diane Macedo last week.",
      "Independent voter Eric Sams voted for Trump in November but said he voted for Crawford on Tuesday.",
      "\"I believe that women's rights are issues. Even Trump says it's a state issue. If you're going to make it a state issue, then our state needs to have access for women to be able to have access to reproductive rights,\" Sams said.",
      "Dwayne Heulse also voted for Trump, but said Tuesday the president's endorsement of Schimel didn't matter.",
      "\"I don't care who Trump supports,\" he said. \"I will go after the guy who I think is the best, and that's what I look at first. He can support the man on the moon, but I'm not going to vote for him unless I feel that this is a person who is going to meet the qualities I want, especially as a judge.\"",
      "Asked Tuesday about the national attention on the race, Schimel said, \u201cIf you told me six months ago that this was what was going to be happening, I I would not have believed it. But here we are, and you know, you just have to keep your head down. I've been running for Wisconsin voters, it's been a -- I've run a 72-county race.\u201d",
      "Crawford will join the bench as the court potentially grapples with key voter issues such as abortion access and redistricting. For example, there is a Wisconsin Supreme Court case regarding if the Wisconsin Constitution protects the right to an abortion, which the court might consider after the new justice is seated.",
      "The race was also seen as a preview of how voters in the battleground state feel a few months into Trump's second term -- especially as Musk and his work with the federal government through the Department of Government Efficiency becomes a key issue given his groups' investments in the race.",
      "Musk continued to push the idea that the Wisconsin election matters because of how potential redistricting cases could impact the balance of power in the House of Representatives. He claimed to Fox News without offering proof that if the conservative candidate loses, Republicans could lose their majority in the House because Wisconsin's congressional districts would be redrawn.",
      "\"Well, the reason tonight's elections are so important is that the judge race will decide whether the Wisconsin district, districts get redrawn. They're kind of trying to gerrymander Wisconsin to remove two Republican seats. And as you know, the -- the House is currently Republican by a razor thin margin, which means that losing this judge race has good chance of causing Republicans to lose control of the House,\" Musk said.",
      "The justice elected won\u2019t take office and order districts to be redrawn, however. The court could revisit congressional districts if the issue comes before the court in a case.",
      "\"That is why it is so significant, and whichever party controls the House, to a significant degree, controls the country which then steers the course of Western civilization,\" Musk said at a high-profile town hall on Sunday in Green Bay.",
      "On Sunday, the tech billionaire also controversially gave away two $1 million checks to attendees at a rally in his latest effort to support Schimel.",
      "Schimel is a former state attorney general and a circuit court judge in Waukesha County. He received almost $20 million in support (such as spending for TV ads) as of Monday from groups linked to Musk, per a tally by the Brennan Center for Justice.",
      "Schimel has also received endorsements from Trump, Musk, Donald Trump Jr., and other key conservative figures.",
      "Schimel has welcomed the conservative support, yet said at a rally last week that he would treat any case fairly, including if it was a case brought by Trump.",
      "However, Crawford and her allies have alleged he would not treat cases involving Trump or Musk fairly, and she made Musk a main target of her campaign.",
      "Schimel, asked on Thursday by ABC affiliate WISN to share his closing argument ahead of the final days in the race, said, \"My closing argument is that people need to take this race seriously. So much is at stake. We have to restore objectivity to this court right now ... We have to put the court back in its proper role where it's not making the law. It's not going through a political agenda. It is applying the law the way the legislature writes it, to the facts of the case.\"",
      "Crawford is a Dane County circuit court judge and a former private attorney. At points, she represented Democratic-aligned groups such as Planned Parenthood, an organization supporting abortion access.",
      "Major liberal donors such as Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker and Democratic donor George Soros have given money to the Wisconsin Democratic Party, and the state party has donated $2 million to Crawford. The national Democratic Party has also invested in the race. She also has the endorsements of former President Barack Obama and former Vice President Kamala Harris.",
      "Crawford told WISN that her closing argument was about an impartial court: \"It's about making sure that we have a Supreme Court that is fair and impartial in interpreting our laws to protect the rights of Wisconsinites. The other choice is an extreme partisan, someone who is selling out to special interests, has a long history of doing that, and has now tied himself to Elon Musk.\"",
      "According to the Brennan Center for Justice, as of Monday, more than $90 million has been spent in the race -- making it the most expensive judicial election in the nation's history. That amount includes more than $49 million spent by Schimel or groups supporting him, and more than $40 million spent by Crawford or groups supporting her.",
      "The nonprofit says that the previous record for spending in a state supreme court race was in Wisconsin's 2023 state supreme court election, when $56 million was spent.",
      "Voters took notice. One Wisconsinite who voted early told WISN, \"There's a lot of outside money coming in, in our state. And I wanted to make sure that my voice is being represented and not other people.\"",
      "As of Monday, around 644,000 people in Wisconsin had voted early in person or by mail, according to the Wisconsin Elections Commission.",
      "The Associated Press also projected that the ballot initiative enshrining a requirement to have a photo ID to vote into Wisconsin\u2019s state constitution will pass.",
      "A photo ID is already required by state law to vote in Wisconsin; enshrining it into the state constitution will not establish new requirements, but will likely make it harder to undo the law.",
      "Democratic groups and voting rights organizations criticized the ballot initiative as potentially disenfranchising voters. Supporters of the initiative argue it will strengthen election security in Wisconsin and cement a requirement that has already been in place.",
      "A Marquette University Law School poll taken in late February also found that a majority of registered voters in Wisconsin support photo ID for voting, and separately, a majority of registered voters in Wisconsin said they would support the ballot initiative.",

      "The group made clear the signatories are expressing their own views and not those of the National Academies or their home institutions.",
      "\"We are speaking out as individuals. We see real danger in this moment,\" the letter said, in part. \"We hold diverse political beliefs, but we are united as researchers in wanting to protect independent scientific inquiry. We are sending this SOS to sound a clear warning: the nation's scientific enterprise is being decimated.\"",
      "\"We call on the administration to cease its wholesale assault on U.S. science, and we urge the public to join this call,\" the letter continued.",

      "Recently, several active research grants related to studies involving LGBTQ+ issues, as well as gender identity and diversity, equity and inclusion, were canceled at the National Institutes of Health. According to termination letters sent to researchers at various universities that were reviewed by ABC News, the projects were canceled because they did not serve the \"priorities\" of the current administration.",

      "A trio of elections have provided plenty of warning signs to Republicans and President Donald Trump",
      "A trio of elections Tuesday provided early warning signs to Republicans and President Donald Trump at the beginning of an ambitious term, as Democrats rallied against his efforts to slash the federal government and the outsized role being played by billionaire Elon Musk.",
      "In the marquee race for a Wisconsin Supreme Court seat, the conservative judge endorsed by Trump and backed by Musk and his groups to the tune of $21 million lost by a significant margin in a state the president won in November. And while Florida Republicans held two of the most pro-Trump House districts in the country, both candidates also significantly underperformed Trump's November margins.",
      "The elections \u2014 the first major contests since Trump's return to power \u2014 were seen as an early measure of voter sentiment as Trump works with unprecedented speed to dramatically upend the federal government, clashing with the courts and seeking revenge as he tests the bounds of presidential power.",
      "The party that loses the presidency in November typically picks up seats in the next midterm elections, and Tuesday's results provided hope for Democrats \u2014 who have faced a barrage of internal and external criticism about their response to Trump \u2014 that they can follow that trend.",
      "Charlie Kirk, the conservative activist and podcaster whose group worked alongside Musk to boost conservative Brad Schimel in Wisconsin, argued Tuesday's Supreme Court loss underscored a fundamental challenge for Republicans, particularly in races where Trump is not on the ballot.",
      "\u201cWe did a lot in Wisconsin, but we fell short. We must realize and appreciate that we are the LOW PROP party now,\u201d he said, referring to low-propensity voters who don't regularly cast ballots. \u201cThe party has been remade. Special elections and off-cycle elections will continue to be a problem without a change of strategy.\u201d",
      "Trump won Wisconsin in November by 0.8 percentage points, or fewer than 30,000 votes. In the first major test since he took office, the perennial battleground state shifted significantly to the left.",
      "Sauk County, northwest of the state capital of Madison, is a state bellwether. Trump won it in November by 626 votes. Sauk shifted 16 points in the direction of Judge Susan Crawford, the liberal favorite backed by national Democrats and liberal billionaire donors like George Soros.",
      "In addition to strong turnout in Democratic-heavy areas, Crawford did measurably better in the suburban Milwaukee counties that Republicans rely on to run up their margins statewide.",
      "Crawford won Kenosha and Racine counties, both of which went for Trump over Democratic nominee Kamala Harris. She was on pace to win by 9 points.",
      "In interviews with more than 20 voters in Waunakee, a politically mixed town north of Madison, several Democrats suggested without prompting that their vote was as much if not more of a repudiation of Trump\u2019s first months in office as it was a decision on the direction of the state high court.",
      "\u201cThis is our chance to say no,\u201d said Linda Grassl, a retired OB-GYN registered nurse, after voting at the Waunakee Public Library corridor Tuesday.",
      "Others disliked the richest man in the world playing such a prominent role.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t like Elon Musk spending money for an election he should have no involvement in,\u201d said Antonio Gray, a 38-year-old Milwaukee security guard. \u201cThey should let the voters vote for who they want to vote for instead of inserting themselves like they have.\u201d",
      "Former Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker said that part of the challenge for Republicans had been \u201ctrying to connect the dots\u201d to turn the state Supreme Court race into one about Trump \u2014 a difficult task in a state judicial race.",
      "\u201cIf you\u2019re somebody who showed up for Trump because you feel forgotten, you don\u2019t typically show up to vote in\u201d these kinds of elections, he said, imagining voters asking themselves: \u201cWhat does this have to do with Trump?\u201d",
      "Still, Walker cautioned against reading the tea leaves too closely.",
      "\u201cI\u2019d be a little bit careful about reading too much into what happens nationally,\u201d he said.",
      "Trump had better luck in Florida, where Republican Randy Fine won his special election in the 6th District to replace Rep. Mike Waltz, who stepped down to serve as Trump\u2019s national security adviser. But Fine\u2019s Democratic challenger, Josh Weil, lost by 14 points less than five months after Waltz won the district by 33.",
      "\u201cThis is the functional equivalent of Republicans running a competitive race in the district that is represented by Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez,\" said House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries beforehand, invoking a liberal favorite whom Trump often denigrates. \"Kamala Harris won that district by 30 points. Do you think a Republican would even be competitive in that district in New York, currently held by Alex? Of course, not.\u201d",
      "Jimmy Patronis, the state\u2019s chief financial officer, fended off a challenge from Democrat Gay Valimont to win the northwest Florida seat vacated by Matt Gaetz but also underperformed Gaetz's last margin of victory.",
      "The pair of wins gave Republicans a 220-213 margin in the House of Representatives, at a time when concerns about a thin GOP majority led Trump to pull the nomination of New York Rep. Elise Stefanik to be United Nations ambassador.",

      "Brenda Ray, 75, a retired nurse, said she didn\u2019t know a lot about Patronis, either, but cast her ballot for him because she believes he\u2019ll \u201cvote with our president.\u201d",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s all we\u2019re looking for,\u201d she said.",

      "The Democrats' victory in the Wisconsin Supreme Court race is a big loss for Elon Musk",
      "MADISON, Wis. -- Judge Susan Crawford preserved liberals\u2019 narrow majority on the Wisconsin Supreme Court Tuesday by defeating conservative Brad Schimel, but in a way the real loser of the election was billionaire Elon Musk.",
      "Musk and his affiliated groups sunk at least $21 million into the normally low-profile race and paid three individual voters $1 million each for signing a petition in an effort to goose turnout in the pivotal battleground state contest. That made the race the first major test of the political impact of Musk, whose prominence in President Donald Trump's administration has skyrocketed with his chaotic cost-cutting initiative that has slashed federal agencies.",
      "Crawford and the Democrats who backed her made Musk the focus of their arguments for holding the seat, contending he was \u201cbuying\u201d the election, which set records for the costliest judicial race in history.",
      "\u201cToday Wisconsinites fended off an unprecedented attack on our democracy, our fair elections and our Supreme Court,\u201d Crawford said in her victory speech. \u201cAnd Wisconsin stood up and said loudly that justice does not have a price, our courts are not for sale.\u201d",
      "Trump endorsed Schimel as the race turned into a proxy fight over national political issues. The state\u2019s high court can rule on cases involving voting rights and redistricting in a state likely to be at the center of both next year\u2019s midterm elections and the 2028 presidential contest.",
      "But Musk\u2019s involvement dialed those dynamics up to 11: \u201cA seemingly small election could determine the fate of Western civilization,\u201d the billionaire said Tuesday in a last-ditch call to voters on his social media site X. \u201cI think it matters for the future of the world.\u201d",
      "Notably, America PAC, the super PAC backed by Musk, spent at least $6 million on vendors who sent door-to-door canvassers across the state, according to the non-partisan Wisconsin Democracy Campaign. It was a reprise of what the group did across the seven most competitive presidential battleground states, including Wisconsin, which were carried by Trump in November.",
      "But the end results this time were not good for Musk. Despite the millions he spent on Schimel, as of late Tuesday night the Supreme Court candidate was losing by four percentage points more than the other Republican-backed statewide candidate, Brittany Kinser, who also fell short in her bid for superintendent of public instruction.",
      "Musk's court race defeat wasn't only because of crushing Democratic margins in deep blue cities like Madison and Milwaukee. Crawford\u2019s margins were higher in places where the Musk-backed group America PAC had been active, including Sauk County, just north of Madison, which Crawford was carrying by 10 points after Trump won it by less than 2 points in November.",
      "In Brown County, the home of Green Bay where Musk headlined a campaign rally with 2,000 people on Sunday, Crawford beat Schimel. Trump won the county by 7 percentage points last year.",
      "Overnight, Musk posted on his X platform that \u201cThe long con of the left is corruption of the judiciary.\u201d In another comment, he seemed to take solace from voters\u2019 approval to elevate the state\u2019s photo ID requirement from state law to constitutional amendment. The platform was rife with criticism from Trump opponents for his involvement in the race.",
      "\u201cPlease send @elonmusk to all the close races!\u201d Jon Favreau, former speechwriter for President Barack Obama, wrote.",
      "\u201cElon Musk is not good at this,\u201d J.B. Pritzker, Illinois\u2019 Democratic governor and a billionaire himself who donated to support Crawford, posted on X.",
      "Voters definitely had Musk on their minds.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s an insane situation going on with the Trump administration, and it feels like Elon Musk is trying to buy votes,\u201d said Kenneth Gifford, a 22-year-old Milwaukee college student, as he cast his ballot on Tuesday. \u201cI want an actual, respectable democracy.\u201d",
      "Others may not have had their vote decided by the billionaire but were all-too aware of the money pouring into their state.",
      "Jim Seeger, a 68-year-old retiree who previously worked in communications and marketing, said he voted for Schimel because he wants Republicans to maintain their outsized majority in Wisconsin\u2019s congressional delegation, which could be at risk if Crawford wins and the court orders the maps redrawn. But, he added, he was disappointed the election had become a \u201cfinancial race.\u201d",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s a shame that we have to spend this much money, especially on a judicial race,\u201d Seeger said as he voted in Eau Claire.",
      "Wisconsin\u2019s Democratic Attorney General, Josh Kaul, sued to bar Musk from making his payments to voters if they signed a petition against \u201cactivist judges.\u201d The state Supreme Court unanimously declined to rule on the case over a technicality.",
      "Musk swooped into the race shortly after Trump\u2019s inauguration. Republicans were pessimistic about being able to win the seat. They lost a longtime conservative majority on the state high court in 2023, and Democrats have excelled in turning out their educated, politically tuned-in coalition during obscure elections such as the one in Wisconsin.",
      "Musk duplicated and expanded on some of the methods he used in the final weeks of last year\u2019s presidential race, when he spent more than $200 million on Trump\u2019s behalf in the seven swing states, including Wisconsin.",
      "This time, in addition to the $1 million checks, Musk offered to pay $20 to anyone who signed up on his group\u2019s site to knock on doors for Schimel and posted a photo of themselves as proof. His organization promised $100 to every voter who signed the petition against liberal judges and another $100 for every signer they referred.",
      "Democrats were happy to make Musk a lightning rod in the race.",
      "\u201cPeople do not want to see Elon Musk buying election after election after election,\u201d Wisconsin Democratic Party Chair Ben Wikler said Monday. \u201cIf it works here, he\u2019s going to do it all over the country.\u201d",

      "A letter to HUD employees this week announcing its program, calling it \"DPR 2,\" acknowledged that employees were skeptical of the \"validity\" of the initial rollout of the deferred resignation program given it was during Congress' budget negotiations, which prevented some from participating.",
      "Agencies are setting different deadlines to accept the offers -- the Department of Transportation set a deadline of just before midnight on April 7, HUD is giving employees until April 11 and GSA is giving employees until April 18.",

    "summary": "Filmmaker Oliver Stone on Tuesday called for Congress to reopen the investigation into the assassination of President John F. Kennedy.",
    "story": [
      "He continued to promote unfounded conspiracy theories after a document release.",
      "Filmmaker Oliver Stone on Tuesday called for Congress to reopen the investigation into the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, trying to revive unfounded conspiracy theories more than six decades after the 1963 killing that shook the nation.",
      "Stone, who raised the theories in his 1991 movie \"JFK,\" testified before a House Task Force on the Declassification of Federal Secrets hearing on last month's release of recently declassified records of the investigation.",
      "\"I ask the committee to reopen what the Warren Commission failed miserably to complete. I ask you, in good faith, outside all political considerations, to reinvestigate the assassination of this President Kennedy, from the scene of the crime to the courtroom,\" he said in his opening remarks.",
      "Stone, as he's done before without providing conclusive evidence, took aim at the Central Intelligence Agency. \"Let us reinvestigate the fingerprints of intelligence all over Lee Harvey Oswald from 1959 to 1960 his violent death in 1963 and most importantly this CIA, whose muddy footprints are all over,\" he said.",
      "In March, the government hastily released more than 2000 documents totaling approximately 80,000 pages. Most of what the government released was not new -- in fact, much of what attracted attention on social media and in news reports had long been in the public domain, except for minor redactions, such as the blacking out of personally-identifiable information of CIA sources or employees (names and addresses) that have now been disclosed.",
      "The newly-declassified versions of these documents did not substantively change what is known about the central Warren Commission finding that Stone has called into question: that Oswald was the lone gunman.",
      "But they did shed light on details of mid-20th century espionage that the CIA had fiercely fought to keep secret and that are treasure trove for historians and scholars.",
      "Republican committee members on Tuesday pushed claims, also without evidence, about the investigations into JFK's death, repeatedly getting facts surrounding the probes wrong and even yielding their time to allow witnesses to freely talk about theories rather than asking questions.",
      "While praising the Trump administration for the release of the JFK documents, they also pushed unfounded claims that not all information has been made publicly available, questioning whether the public would ever truly know what happened.",
      "Democrats on the subcommittee sought to focus on what they referenced as the truth, dissuading their colleagues and witnesses from drifting into conspiracy theories while criticizing the rollout of the declassified documents.",
      "Stone's film focused on the work of New Orleans District Attorney Jim Garrison, who conducted an independent investigation of the assassination, resulting in his failed prosecution of New Orleans businessman Clay Shaw, who Garrison alleged was involved in a CIA conspiracy to kill the president.",
      "The film was a commercial and critical success, grossing $205 million and winning two Academy Awards. It was credited with popularizing conspiracy theories of FBI and CIA involvement in the Kennedy assassination.",
      "The film was credited by the Assassination Records Review Board as being at least partially responsible for the passage of the President John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection Act of 1992. Stone testified before Congress in support of that bill. The act mandated the release of all documents related to the assassination by 2017, though that timeline was delayed several times.",
      "The movie's release also coincided with an increased degree of public skepticism in the Warren Commission finding that Oswald acted alone.",
      "Gallup polling as recent as 2023 has consistently shown that a majority of Americans has consistently believed more than one person was responsible for the assassination. The number believing the official conclusion of a lone gunman saw a sharp decline in the 1970s and 1980s, reaching an all-time low of 10% in 1992.",

    "story": [
      "Trump is urging Republican senators to keep Canadian tariffs in place.",
      "President Donald Trump on Tuesday called on the Senate to keep the United States' tariffs on Canada in place -- hours before Democrats in the upper chamber could potentially force a vote aimed at blocking the president from imposing tariffs on the ally country.",
      "Democratic Sens. Tim Kaine, Amy Klobuchar and Mark Warner are leading the effort to end the international emergency -- which Kaine has called a \"made-up emergency\" -- that Trump has declared against Canada, thereby shunting his administration's authority to unilaterally impose tariffs. Trump has derived his authority to impose tariffs by declaring a national emergency caused by the flow of fentanyl and undocumented migration from Canada, Mexico and China. But Democrats are now challenging that emergency status.",
      "\"President Trump is saying that there is an emergency with Canada. Canada is a friend not an adversary. Canada is a sovereign nation not a 51st state,\" Kaine said on Tuesday.",
      "It comes just one day before Trump's tariffs on Canada are expected to go into effect as part of \"Liberation Day\" -- the president's plans to roll out sweeping tariffs that he has said will impact \"all countries.\"",
      "On Tuesday, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney vowed to respond with retaliatory tariffs if Trump slaps additional levies on Canadian goods as part of Wednesday's expected tariff announcement.",
      "Trump said in a social media post that the U.S. is \"making progress to end this terrible Fentanyl Crisis\" that he claims is coming from Canada, and said that \"Republicans in the Senate MUST vote to keep the National Emergency in place, so we can finish the job, and end the scourge.\"",
      "During a press conference on Tuesday, Democrats argued that Trump is falsely imposing an emergency in order to give cover for the tariffs with hopes of raising revenue to pay for his tax cut plan. That's why they say this vote is so important.",
      "Trump criticized Kaine for his role in the effort to block tariffs.",
      "\"Don't let the Democrats have a Victory. It would be devastating for the Republican Party and, far more importantly, for the United States,\" Trump wrote.",
      "Unlike most legislation in the Senate, this resolution will only need a simple majority of votes to pass, and it very likely may. Only a handful of Republicans would be needed to hit that threshold.",
      "But there is nothing compelling the House, controlled by Republicans, to take up the legislation, and it's almost certain that House Speaker Mike Johnson would stay far away from the resolution.",
      "The Senate vote could get pushed to Wednesday as Sen. Cory Booker continues a filibuster he started at 7 p.m. Monday night. Booker is protesting against the national \"crisis\" he said Trump and Elon Musk created.",
      "A number of Republicans have expressed skepticism about Canadian tariffs and now find themselves in a difficult place of having to choose whether to block Trump's authority or cast a vote to try to forestall the tariffs.",
      "Majority Leader John Thune said Monday that he's unsure whether they'll be able to defeat the resolution.",
      "\"We'll see,\" he said. \"Obviously, as you know, and I'm among these, there is concerns about tariffs on Canada and, you know, what the ultimate objective is. If it's about fentanyl and stopping the drug trade, drug war, that's an issue obviously that there is a lot of interest. Obviously we want to give the president as much latitude as possible to deal with specific problems like that, but as you know, I'm in a very different place when it comes to across-the-board tariffs and Canada.\"",
      "Thune said on Tuesday that he hopes \"we'll have the votes.\"",
      "\"The president declared the emergency to deal with the issue of fentanyl -- flow of fentanyl into this country, not only from our southern border, but also from our north. That's what the emergency declaration is about. And what this would do is undo that,\" he said. \"I think the president needs to have tools at his disposal to deal with what I think are national emergencies. And certainly, you know, the tens of thousands of people that are killed in this country every year, because fentanyl represents that. So I hope we'll have the votes.\"",

      "WASHINGTON -- U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio travels this week to a gathering of top diplomats from NATO countries and is sure to find allies that are alarmed, angered and confused by the Trump administration\u2019s desire to reestablish ties with Russia and its escalating rhetorical attacks on longtime transatlantic partners.",
      "Allies are deeply concerned by President Donald Trump\u2019s readiness to draw closer to Russian leader Vladimir Putin, who sees NATO as a threat, amid a U.S. effort to broker a ceasefire in Ukraine. Recent White House comments and insults directed at NATO allies Canada and Denmark \u2014 as well as the military alliance itself \u2014 have only increased the angst, especially as new U.S. tariffs are taking effect against friends and foes alike.",
      "Rubio arrives in Brussels on Thursday for two days of meetings with his NATO counterparts and European officials, and he can expect to be confronted with questions about the future U.S. role in the alliance.",
      "For 75 years, NATO has been anchored on American leadership, and based on what they have seen and heard since Trump took office in January, European officials have expressed deep concerns that Trump may upend all of that when he and other NATO leaders meet for a June summit in the Netherlands.",
      "As Rubio did last month at a meeting of foreign ministers from the Group of 7 industrialized democracies, America's top diplomat, who is regarded by many overseas as a more pragmatic and less dogmatic member of Trump's administration, may be able to salvage a watered-down group consensus on the war in Ukraine.",
      "That's even as Trump said this week that Ukraine \u201cwas never going to be a member of NATO\u201d despite leaders declaring at last year's summit that the country was on an \u201cirreversible\u201d path to join.",
      "But Rubio will be hard-pressed to explain Washington\u2019s unprovoked verbal attacks on NATO allies Canada, which Trump says he wants to claim as a 51st state, and Denmark, whose territory of Greenland he says the U.S. should annex. Both have been accused of being \u201cbad allies\u201d by Trump and Vice President JD Vance.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s pretty clear neither territory has any interest in joining a Trumpian America,\u201d said Ian Kelly, U.S. ambassador to Georgia during the Obama and first Trump administration and now an international studies professor at Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s going to be a lot of very anxious Euros about what Trump is going to call for and what announcements he\u2019s going to make,\u201d he said. \u201cIf he isn't already, Rubio is going to be in a mode of trying to reassure European allies that we are not, in fact, not dependable.\u201d",
      "Yet, in just under two months, NATO has been shaken to its core, challenged increasingly by Russia and the biggest land war in Europe since 1945 from the outside, and by the Trump administration from within, breaking with decades of relatively predictable U.S. leadership.",
      "Trump has consistently complained about NATO members' defense spending and even raised doubts about the U.S. commitment to mutual defense in the alliance's founding treaty, which says an attack on one NATO member is considered an attack on all.",
      "Since Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth warned last month that U.S. security priorities lie elsewhere \u2014 in Asia and on its own borders \u2014 the Europeans have waited to learn how big a military drawdown in Europe could be and how fast it may happen.",
      "In Europe and Canada, governments are working on \u201cburden shifting\u201d plans to take over more of the load, while trying to ensure that no security vacuum is created if U.S. troops and equipment are withdrawn from the continent.",
      "These allies are keen to hear from Rubio what the Trump administration\u2019s intentions are and hope to secure some kind of roadmap that lays out what will happen next and when, so they can synchronize planning and use European forces to plug any gaps.",
      "At the same time, NATO\u2019s deterrent effect against an adversary like Russia is only credible when backed by U.S. firepower. For the Europeans and Canada, this means that U.S. nuclear weapons and the 6th Fleet must remain stationed in Europe.",
      "\u201cAmerica is indispensable for credible deterrence,\" a senior NATO diplomat told reporters on condition of anonymity to speak ahead of the meeting.",
      "Around 100,000 U.S. troops are deployed across the continent. European allies believe at least 20,000 personnel sent by the Biden administration after Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine three years ago could be withdrawn.",
      "Another priority for U.S. allies is to understand whether Trump believes that Russia still poses the greatest security threat. In their summit statement last year, NATO leaders insisted that \u201cRussia remains the most significant and direct threat to Allies\u2019 security.\u201d",
      "But Trump\u2019s receptiveness to Putin and recent favorable remarks by some U.S. officials have raised doubts. The question, diplomats say, is why allies should spend 5% of their gross domestic product on their defense budgets if Russia is no longer a threat.",
      "At the same time, the Europeans and Canada know they must spend more \u2014 not least to protect themselves and keep arming Ukraine. At their next summit in June, NATO leaders are expected to raise the alliance\u2019s military budget goal from at least 2% to more than 3%.",
      "Rubio \u201cis in a very difficult position,\u201d said Jeff Rathke, president of the American-German Institute at Johns Hopkins University. Trump \u201chas tried to convince allies that a U.S. realignment with Russia is in the best interests of the U.S. and presumably Europe, and at the same time tell them that they need to double their defense spending to deal with threats posed by Russia,\" he said. \"The logical question they will ask is \u2018why?'\u201d",

      "WASHINGTON -- U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio travels this week to a gathering of top diplomats from NATO countries and is sure to find allies that are alarmed, angered and confused by the Trump administration\u2019s desire to reestablish ties with Russia and its escalating rhetorical attacks on longtime transatlantic partners.",
      "Allies are deeply concerned by President Donald Trump\u2019s readiness to draw closer to Russian leader Vladimir Putin, who sees NATO as a threat, amid a U.S. effort to broker a ceasefire in Ukraine. Recent White House comments and insults directed at NATO allies Canada and Denmark \u2014 as well as the military alliance itself \u2014 have only increased the angst, especially as new U.S. tariffs are taking effect against friends and foes alike.",
      "Rubio arrives in Brussels on Thursday for two days of meetings with his NATO counterparts and European officials, and he can expect to be confronted with questions about the future U.S. role in the alliance.",
      "For 75 years, NATO has been anchored on American leadership, and based on what they have seen and heard since Trump took office in January, European officials have expressed deep concerns that Trump may upend all of that when he and other NATO leaders meet for a June summit in the Netherlands.",
      "As Rubio did last month at a meeting of foreign ministers from the Group of 7 industrialized democracies, America's top diplomat, who is regarded by many overseas as a more pragmatic and less dogmatic member of Trump's administration, may be able to salvage a watered-down group consensus on the war in Ukraine.",

      "SAN FRANCISCO -- A federal judge in California on Tuesday ordered the Trump administration to temporarily restore legal aid to tens of thousands of migrant children who are in the United States without a parent or guardian.",
      "The Republican administration on March 21 terminated a contract with the Acacia Center for Justice, which provides legal services for unaccompanied migrant children under 18 through a network of legal aid groups that subcontract with the center. Eleven subcontractor groups sued, saying that 26,000 children were at risk of losing their attorneys; Acacia is not a plaintiff.",
      "Those groups argued that the government has an obligation under a 2008 anti-trafficking law to provide vulnerable children with legal counsel.",
      "U.S. District Judge Araceli Mart\u00ednez-Olgu\u00edn of San Francisco granted a temporary restraining order late Tuesday. She wrote that advocates raised legitimate questions about whether the administration violated the 2008 law, warranting a return to the status quo while the case continues. The order will take effect Wednesday and runs through April 16.",
      "\u201cThe Court additionally finds that the continued funding of legal representation for unaccompanied children promotes efficiency and fairness within the immigration system,\u201d she wrote.",
      "It is the third legal setback in less than a week for the Trump administration\u2019s immigration crackdown, though all may prove temporary as the lawsuits advance. On Friday, a federal judge in Boston said people with final deportation orders must have a \u201c meaningful opportunity \u201d to argue against being sent to a country other than their own. On Monday, another federal judge in San Francisco put on hold plans to end protections for hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans, including 350,000 whose legal status was scheduled to expire April 7.",
      "The Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2008, which created special protections for migrant children who cannot navigate a complex immigration system on their own.

      "Defendants, which include the Department of Health and Human Services and its Office of Refugee Resettlement, said that taxpayers have no obligation to pay the cost of direct legal aid to migrant children at a time when the government is trying to save money. They also said district courts have no jurisdiction over a contract termination that would have expired at the end of March.",
      "Acacia is under a new contract with the government to provide legal orientations, including \u201cknow your rights\u201d clinics.",
      "But plaintiffs said they are not asking for the contract to be restored; rather, they want a return to the status quo, which is spending $5 billion that Congress appropriated so children have representation, said Karen Tumlin with the Justice Action Center at a court hearing Tuesday.",
      "She said the administration cannot simply zero out funding without providing direction on who will help these children.",

    "summary": "The Democrats' victory in the Wisconsin Supreme Court race is a big loss for Elon Musk",
    "story": [
      "The Democrats' victory in the Wisconsin Supreme Court race is a big loss for Elon Musk",
      "MADISON, Wis. -- Judge Susan Crawford preserved liberals\u2019 narrow majority on the Wisconsin Supreme Court Tuesday by defeating conservative Brad Schimel, but in a way the real loser of the election was billionaire Elon Musk.",
      "Musk and his affiliated groups sunk at least $21 million into the normally low-profile race and paid three individual voters $1 million each for signing a petition in an effort to goose turnout in the pivotal battleground state contest. That made the race the first major test of the political impact of Musk, whose prominence in President Donald Trump's administration has skyrocketed with his chaotic cost-cutting initiative that has slashed federal agencies.",
      "Crawford and the Democrats who backed her made Musk the focus of their arguments for holding the seat, contending he was \u201cbuying\u201d the election, which set records for the costliest judicial race in history.",
      "\u201cToday Wisconsinites fended off an unprecedented attack on our democracy, our fair elections and our Supreme Court,\u201d Crawford said in her victory speech. \u201cAnd Wisconsin stood up and said loudly that justice does not have a price, our courts are not for sale.\u201d",
      "Trump endorsed Schimel as the race turned into a proxy fight over national political issues. The state\u2019s high court can rule on cases involving voting rights and redistricting in a state likely to be at the center of both next year\u2019s midterm elections and the 2028 presidential contest.",
      "But Musk\u2019s involvement dialed those dynamics up to 11: \u201cA seemingly small election could determine the fate of Western civilization,\u201d the billionaire said Tuesday in a last-ditch call to voters on his social media site X. \u201cI think it matters for the future of the world.\u201d",
      "Notably, America PAC, the super PAC backed by Musk, spent at least $6 million on vendors who sent door-to-door canvassers across the state, according to the non-partisan Wisconsin Democracy Campaign. It was a reprise of what the group did across the seven most competitive presidential battleground states, including Wisconsin, which were carried by Trump in November.",
      "But the end results this time were not good for Musk. Despite the millions he spent on Schimel, as of late Tuesday night the Supreme Court candidate was losing by four percentage points more than the other Republican-backed statewide candidate, Brittany Kinser, who also fell short in her bid for superintendent of public instruction.",
      "Musk's court race defeat wasn't only because of crushing Democratic margins in deep blue cities like Madison and Milwaukee. Crawford\u2019s margins were higher in places where the Musk-backed group America PAC had been active, including Sauk County, just north of Madison, which Crawford was carrying by 10 points after Trump won it by less than 2 points in November.",
      "In Brown County, the home of Green Bay where Musk headlined a campaign rally with 2,000 people on Sunday, Crawford beat Schimel. Trump won the county by 7 percentage points last year.",
      "Overnight, Musk posted on his X platform that \u201cThe long con of the left is corruption of the judiciary.\u201d In another comment, he seemed to take solace from voters\u2019 approval to elevate the state\u2019s photo ID requirement from state law to constitutional amendment. The platform was rife with criticism from Trump opponents for his involvement in the race.",
      "\u201cPlease send @elonmusk to all the close races!\u201d Jon Favreau, former speechwriter for President Barack Obama, wrote.",
      "\u201cElon Musk is not good at this,\u201d J.B. Pritzker, Illinois\u2019 Democratic governor and a billionaire himself who donated to support Crawford, posted on X.",
      "Voters definitely had Musk on their minds.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s an insane situation going on with the Trump administration, and it feels like Elon Musk is trying to buy votes,\u201d said Kenneth Gifford, a 22-year-old Milwaukee college student, as he cast his ballot on Tuesday. \u201cI want an actual, respectable democracy.\u201d",
      "Others may not have had their vote decided by the billionaire but were all-too aware of the money pouring into their state.",
      "Jim Seeger, a 68-year-old retiree who previously worked in communications and marketing, said he voted for Schimel because he wants Republicans to maintain their outsized majority in Wisconsin\u2019s congressional delegation, which could be at risk if Crawford wins and the court orders the maps redrawn. But, he added, he was disappointed the election had become a \u201cfinancial race.\u201d",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s a shame that we have to spend this much money, especially on a judicial race,\u201d Seeger said as he voted in Eau Claire.",
      "Wisconsin\u2019s Democratic Attorney General, Josh Kaul, sued to bar Musk from making his payments to voters if they signed a petition against \u201cactivist judges.\u201d The state Supreme Court unanimously declined to rule on the case over a technicality.",
      "Musk swooped into the race shortly after Trump\u2019s inauguration. Republicans were pessimistic about being able to win the seat. They lost a longtime conservative majority on the state high court in 2023, and Democrats have excelled in turning out their educated, politically tuned-in coalition during obscure elections such as the one in Wisconsin.",
      "Musk duplicated and expanded on some of the methods he used in the final weeks of last year\u2019s presidential race, when he spent more than $200 million on Trump\u2019s behalf in the seven swing states, including Wisconsin.",
      "This time, in addition to the $1 million checks, Musk offered to pay $20 to anyone who signed up on his group\u2019s site to knock on doors for Schimel and posted a photo of themselves as proof. His organization promised $100 to every voter who signed the petition against liberal judges and another $100 for every signer they referred.",
      "Democrats were happy to make Musk a lightning rod in the race.",
      "\u201cPeople do not want to see Elon Musk buying election after election after election,\u201d Wisconsin Democratic Party Chair Ben Wikler said Monday. \u201cIf it works here, he\u2019s going to do it all over the country.\u201d",

      "Democratic Sen. Cory Booker broke the record for the longest floor speech in recorded Senate history when he bested Sen. Strom Thurmond's filibuster of the Civil Rights Act of 1957",
      "WASHINGTON -- Democratic Sen. Cory Booker ended his record-setting speech the same way he began it, more than 25 hours earlier: by invoking the words of his mentor, the late congressman and civil rights icon John Lewis.",
      "\u201cHe endured beatings savagely on the Edmund Pettus Bridge, at lunch counters, on freedom rides. He said he had to do something. He would not normalize a moment like this,\u201d Booker said of Lewis' work as a young activist during the Civil Rights movement. \u201cHe would not just go along with business as usual.\u201d",
      "\"He said for us to go out and cause some good trouble, necessary trouble, to redeem the soul of our nation,\u201d Booker said.",
      "A break from \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d was what Booker had in mind as he performed a feat of political endurance, holding the Senate floor for 25 hours and 5 minutes while delivering a wide-ranging critique of President Donald Trump and his policies.",
      "In doing so, Booker of New Jersey broke the record for longest Senate floor speech, a mark that had belonged for decades to Strom Thurmond, the avowed segregationist from South Carolina who filibustered the Civil Rights Act of 1957. Booker said he'd been aware of Thurmond's record since first coming to the Senate in 2013 \u2014 a room near the Senate chamber is still named for him \u2014 and it bothered him.",
      "\u201cIt seemed wrong to me,\" Booker said. \"It always seemed wrong.\u201d",
      "Booker, a Black progressive, spoke about his roots as a descendant of both slaves and slave-owners as he invoked the Civil Rights movement, implicitly linking Lewis' steadfast resistance to Jim Crow to the modern-day opponents of Trump\u2019s reshaping of government and society.",
      "Throughout his speech he read letters from Americans about the impact that Trump's agenda is having on their lives, drawing historical parallels and warning that the country faces a \u201clooming constitutional crisis.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis is a moral moment,\" Booker said. \"It\u2019s not left or right; it\u2019s right or wrong.\u201d",
      "As Booker held the floor, dozens of members of the Congressional Black Caucus flanked the back of the Senate chamber in support, including House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries and Rep. Maxine Waters. Other CBC members kept close to the floor, including Sens. Angela Alsobrooks, Lisa Blunt Rochester and Raphael Warnock.",
      "Before Booker surpassed Thurmond\u2019s 68-year-old record, Jeffries said Booker's speech was \u201can incredibly powerful moment ... because he is fighting to preserve the American way of life and our democracy. And the record was held by Strom Thurmond who was actually defending Jim Crow segregation.\u201d",
      "Rep. Hank Johnson, D-Ga., a close friend of Lewis who represented the neighboring district in metropolitan Atlanta, said Booker\u2019s speech was \u201can act of resistance.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe American people want to see us as their representatives do everything we can to resist the encroachment on our liberties and the taking away of benefits,\u201d Johnson said.",
      "Booker's speech captured attention at a time when Democrats have grown frustrated and despondent at their inability to stop Trump\u2019s plans. Locked out of power in Congress and the executive branch, Democrats have struggled with how to take on Trump and the slashing of government being carried out by Elon Musk and his Department of Government Efficiency.",
      "Grassroots liberal organizers have been urging major Democratic figures to take a more combative approach. Some hoped that Booker\u2019s speech would offer the party lessons going forward.",
      "Booker \u201cis reminding all of America and his own party, not simply to stand for what we\u2019re against, but to stand up for what we believe in,\u201d said Brittany Packnett Cunningham, an activist who helped lead the 2014 protests against police brutality in Ferguson, Mo.",
      "\"I think he recognized that people are looking for our leaders to have the moral clarity to declare that what\u2019s happening is wrong, and to determine, to do something about it,\u201d she said.",
      "As Booker's marathon speech drew to a close, he recalled the last conversation he ever had with Lewis, who was known for his acts of civil disobedience in Congress throughout his career until his passing in 2020.",
      "Booker recalled telling Lewis, \"we\u2019ll do everything possible to make you proud.\u201d And he said he had no doubt what Lewis' message would be if he were alive today.",
      "\"John Lewis would say, do something,\u201d Booker said.",
      "\u201cHe wouldn\u2019t treat this moral moment like it was normal.\u201d",

      "The Senate has confirmed Matt Whitaker as President Donald Trump\u2019s U.S. ambassador to NATO",
      "WASHINGTON -- The Senate confirmed Matt Whitaker late Tuesday as President Donald Trump\u2019s U.S. ambassador to NATO, a crucial emissary to the Western alliance at a time of growing concern about the American commitment abroad.",
      "Whitaker, who had served in Trump's first administration at the Justice Department, brings a law enforcement background rather than deep foreign policy or national security ties. He was confirmed by the Senate on a vote of 52-45.",
      "During a confirmation hearing, Whitaker assured senators that the Trump administration\u2019s commitment to the military alliance was \u201cironclad.\u201d",
      "Trump has long been skeptical, and often hostile, toward the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, which was formed by the U.S. and other countries in the aftermath of World War II as a deterrent to potential aggression from what was then the Soviet Union.",
      "The U.S. commitment has been called into question due to Trump\u2019s sharp criticism of European allies and his eagerness to build ties with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Trump has pushed other countries to contribute a greater share of their budgets to their the own defense, rather than relying on the U.S.",
      "Whitaker had been chief of staff to Attorney General Jeff Sessions during Trump's first term, and then was chosen to become acting attorney general when his boss was fired after recusing himself from the department's investigation of Russian influence in the 2016 election.",
      "He had been considered for the top job in the Justice Department with the president's return to the White House, but instead was tapped for the ambassadorship.",
      "In nominating him, Trump said in a statement that Whitaker was \u201ca strong warrior and loyal Patriot\u201d who \u201cwill ensure the United States\u2019 interests are advanced and defended.\u201d",

      "MONTGOMERY, Ala. -- An Alabama sheriff's deputy will plead guilty to assaulting a man suffering from a mental health crisis who later died of sepsis and hypothermia in the local jail, court filings made public on Tuesday revealed.",
      "The plea supports a recent onslaught of reports that depict a rampant culture of abuse among the local sheriff's department in Walker County, in a rural region of northern Alabama.",
      "Carl Lofton Carpenter, 55, agreed to plead guilty to two counts of deprivation of rights, according to the plea. Carpenter and fellow Walker County Sheriff's Deputy James Handley arrested Tony Mitchell in 2023. Mitchell died in the Walker County jail just two weeks later after he was detained in a concrete cell covered in feces with no toilet or access to medical attention.",
      "Carpenter stepped on Mitchell's genitals while he was handcuffed, saying, \u201cThis is how we treat seizures in Walker County,\u201d according to the plea document. Carpenter then dragged Mitchell on the ground, kicked him and threw him roughly into the police car.",
      "Carpenter assaulted Mitchell even though he was \u201ccompliant, obeyed commands, and posed no threat of harm to the officers,\u201d the plea says,",
      "The plea deal says Carpenter \u201chad become accustomed to harming arrestees unnecessarily consistent with the culture of the Walker County Sheriff's Office.\"",
      "The deputies first encountered Mitchell at his residence while responding to a call from one of his relatives who asked for a welfare check on him. The sheriff\u2019s office said at the time that Mitchell was talking about portals to hell and asserted that he had fired a weapon at officers.",
      "The plea also reveals that Walker County Sheriff Nick Smith was directly responsible for sending Mitchell to the local jail where he would later die, \u201cdespite (Mitchell) demonstrating symptoms of severe mental illness.\u201d",
      "At least 10 other jail employees have pleaded guilty to charges related to Mitchell's death. Neither Smith nor lawyers for Carpenter and Handley responded to separate emailed requests for comment on Tuesday evening.",
      "The years long investigation has revealed harrowing details about the weeks leading up to Mitchell\u2019s death. A plea deal made public in January reveals officers intentionally kept the conditions in the Walker County jail \u201cas filthy as possible\u201d to convince county commissioners to increase salaries and the jail budget.",

      "U.S. officials say the U.S. Naval Academy has removed nearly 400 books from its library after being told by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth\u2019s office to review and get rid of books that promote diversity, equity and inclusion",
      "WASHINGTON -- The U.S. Naval Academy has removed nearly 400 books from its library after being told by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's office to review and get rid of ones that promote diversity, equity and inclusion, U.S officials said Tuesday.",
      "Academy officials were told to review the library late last week, and an initial search had identified about 900 books for a closer look. They decided on nearly 400 to remove and began doing so Monday, finishing before Hegseth arrived for a visit Tuesday that had already been planned and was not connected to the library purge, officials said. A list of the books has not yet been made available.",
      "Pulling the books off the shelves is another step in the Trump administration\u2019s far-reaching effort to eliminate so-called DEI content from federal agencies, including policies, programs, online and social media postings and curriculum at schools.",
      "Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell said late Tuesday, \u201cAll service academies are fully committed to executing and implementing President Trump\u2019s Executive Orders.\u201d",
      "The Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland, the Air Force Academy near Colorado Springs, Colorado, and the U.S. Military Academy in West Point, New York, had not been included in President Donald Trump's executive order in January that banned DEI instruction, programs or curriculum in kindergarten through 12th grade schools that receive federal funding. That is because the academies are colleges.",
      "Pentagon leaders, however, suddenly turned their attention to the Naval Academy last week when a media report noted that the school had not removed books that promoted DEI. A U.S. official said the academy was told late last week to conduct the review and removal. It isn't clear if the order was directed by Hegseth or someone else on his staff.",
      "A West Point official confirmed that the school had completed a review of its curriculum and was prepared to review library content if directed by the Army. The Air Force and Naval academies had also done curriculum reviews as had been required.",
      "An Air Force Academy official said the school continually reviews its curriculum, coursework and other materials to ensure it all complies with executive orders and Defense Department policies. Last week, Lt. Gen. Tony Bauernfeind, the Air Force Academy superintendent, told Congress that the school was in the middle of its course review, but there was no mention of books.",
      "The officials spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss academy policies.",
      "Hegseth has aggressively pushed the department to erase DEI programs and online content, but the campaign has been met with questions from angry lawmakers, local leaders and citizens over the removal of military heroes and historic mentions from Defense Department websites and social media pages.",
      "In response, the department has scrambled to restore some of those posts as their removals have come to light.",
      "The confusion about how to interpret the DEI policy was underscored Monday as Naval Academy personnel mistakenly removed some photos of distinguished female Jewish graduates from a display case as they prepared for Hegseth's visit. The photos were put back.",
      "In a statement, the Navy said it is aware that photos were mistakenly removed from the Naval Academy Jewish Center. It said U.S. Naval Academy leadership was immediately taking steps to review and correct the unauthorized removal.",
      "Hegseth spoke with students and had lunch at the academy Tuesday, but media were not invited or allowed to cover the visit.",

      "Chrissy Lovitt and Macy, 11, were in a fishing boat about 2 miles (roughly 3 kilometers) off Lahaina on Saturday when they spotted a humpback whale in the waters.",
      "\u201cAnd he heard her barking and he just swam over to meet her,\u201d Lovitt recalled Tuesday. \u201cAnd it was the best day of her life.\u201d",
      "In the video, Macy is seen barking frantically as the whale nears the boat. The whale's head emerges and it appears to turn and look at the excited dog.",
      "\u201cShe's been barking at whales her whole life, but they haven't wanted to do anything with her,\u201d Lovitt said.",
      "Macy is Lovitt's trusty companion when she leads a boatload of tourists to marvel at whales. \u201cShe loves the ocean,\u201d said Lovitt, now a Maui boat captain for 25 years. \u201cShe grew up on it.\u201d",
      "Macy is \u201cobsessed with sea life and whales,\u201d Lovitt added. \u201cShe's 11 and I know we don't get forever with her. But this has been on her bucket list so I'm just super happy for her.\"",
      "Lovitt had just started a whale-watching tour business when the massive inferno wiped out most of Lahaina, including her three boats, equipment and vehicles. On the day of the fire Aug. 8, Lovitt and her partner were trying to secure their boats in the fierce winds when the flames arrived. They had no choice but to head out in the ocean on a boat. There, Lovitt said, they helped the U.S. Coast Guard rescue people who were forced to jump in the water to flee the flames.",
      "They relaunched their business in December and have been setting aside free seats on tours for fire survivors, hoping whale-watching will help them heal from the tragedy.",

      "ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. -- The FBI is sending extra agents, analysts and other personnel to field offices in 10 states over the next six months to help investigate unsolved violent crimes in Indian Country, marking a continuation of efforts by the federal government to address high rates of violence affecting Native American communities.",
      "The U.S. Justice Department announced Tuesday that the temporary duty assignments began immediately and will rotate every 90 days in field offices that include Albuquerque, Phoenix, Denver, Detroit, Minneapolis, Oklahoma City, Seattle, Salt Lake City, Portland, Oregon, and Jackson, Mississippi.",
      "The FBI will be working with the Bureau of Indian Affairs Missing and Murdered Unit, tribal authorities and federal prosecutors in each of the states.",
      "\u201cCrime rates in American Indian and Alaska Native communities are unacceptably high,\u201d U.S. Attorney General Pamela Bondi said in a statement. \u201cBy surging FBI resources and collaborating closely with U.S. attorneys and tribal law enforcement to prosecute cases, the Department of Justice will help deliver the accountability that these communities deserve.\u201d",
      "Work to bring more attention to the crisis has spanned decades. President Donald Trump was the first president to formally recognize the issue when he signed an executive order during his first term establishing a task force to tackle the high rate of killings and disappearances among Native Americans and Alaska Natives.",
      "He also signed legislation in 2020 that directed the Justice and Interior departments to consult with tribes while developing national law enforcement guidelines and a separate measure that called for a federal commission to be established to find ways to improve how government responds to Indian Country cases.",
      "President Joe Biden issued his own executive order on public safety in 2021, and then-Interior Secretary Deb Haaland launched efforts to implement the Not Invisible Act and the federal commission. Public meetings were held around the country as part of the effort, survivors and family members told heartbreaking stories and recommendations were crafted in 2023.",
      "The Justice Department that year also established its Missing and Murdered Indigenous Persons outreach program, dispatching more attorneys and coordinators to certain regions to help with unsolved cases.",
      "In past years, the FBI's Operation Not Forgotten had deployed about 50 people for the temporary duty. This year, it's 60.",
      "But without consistent resources and trained detectives investigating the crimes, advocates say many cases go unsolved. They called the FBI's latest surge an essential investment, saying it should be made permanent.",
      "\u201cThis shouldn\u2019t be just a one-time, six-month effort,\" said Abigail Echo-Hawk, director of the Seattle-based Urban Indian Health Institute. \"We need this type of investment to continue and for Indian Country to get the resources that we so desperately need.\u201d",
      "Being able to investigate and hold people accountable can serve as a deterrent, Echo-Hawk said, adding that she's hopeful some families can find justice as a result of the effort.",
      "It took about four months for the Biden administration to issue a response to the congressionally mandated recommendations submitted by the Not Invisible Commission, acknowledging at the time that more needed to be done across the federal government to resolve the crisis and support healing from the generational traumas. But it's unclear what has become of the recommendations now as a Justice Department webpage that included a link to the report no longer exists.",
      "Echo-Hawk hopes Trump follows through with the promises made and the work he started during the first term to address the problem.",
      "\u201cThe Not Invisible Act Commission recommendations need to be restored,\u201d she said, \u201cand we need to look at opportunities to actualize them.\u201d",
      "According to federal authorities, the FBI\u2019s Indian Country program had 4,300 open investigations at the beginning of the fiscal year. That included more than 900 death investigations, 1,000 child abuse investigations, and more than 500 domestic violence and adult sexual abuse cases.",
      "The operation in the past two years has supported more than 500 investigations, leading to the recovery of 10 children who were victims and the arrests of more than 50 suspects.",

      "A judge in Boston is holding an U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent in contempt after he detained a suspect while he was on trial",
      "BOSTON -- A judge in Boston is holding a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent in contempt after he detained a suspect while the man was on trial.",
      "ICE agent Brian Sullivan detained Wilson Martell-Lebron last week as he was leaving court. But a Boston Municipal Court judge issued a ruling Monday against Sullivan, arguing that he had deprived Martell-Lebron of his rights to due process and a fair trial by taking him into custody.",
      "\u201cIt's a case of violating a defendant's right to present at trial and confront witnesses against him,\" Judge Mark Summerville said from the bench. \u201cIt couldn't be more serious.\u201d",
      "Summerville dismissed the charge against Martell-Lebron of making false statements on his driver\u2019s license application -- namely that he wasn't Martell-Lebron. After that, Summerville filed the contempt charge against Sullivan, which could lead Suffolk County District Attorney Kevin Hayden review the case to determine if any charges should be filed.",
      "\u201cIt's reprehensible,\u201d Ryan Sullivan, one of Martell-Lebron's lawyers said. \u201cLaw enforcement agents have a job to see justice is done. Prosecutors have a job to see justice is done. There is no greater injustice in my mind than the government arresting someone, without identifying themselves, and preventing them from exercising their constitutionally guaranteed right to a jury trial.\u201d",
      "A spokesman for ICE did not return a call seeking comment.",
      "The move by ICE is the latest effort to target Boston over its handling of immigration.",
      "President Donald Trump\u2019s border czar Tom Homan and Republicans in Congress have accused the city of failing to cooperate to get people charged with violent crimes deported. Mayor Michelle Wu, a Democrat up for reelection this year, said she wants Boston be a welcoming place for immigrants and that city policies limit cooperation with immigration enforcement.",
      "Sullivan described a tense scene, in which ICE agents pounced on Martell-Lebron without identifying themselves, put him into a pickup truck and sped away. The trial Thursday had just begun with opening statements and the first witnesses.",
      "Sullivan said Martell-Lebron, who is from the Dominican Republic and living with family in Massachusetts, is now at the Plymouth detention facility for allegedly being an undocumented immigrant, he said.",
      "\u201cWhat we were challenging is that they arrested him in the middle of his trial and did not return him,\u201d he said. \u201cIf he had been brought to court on Friday morning by ICE, we would not have moved to dismiss. We would not be asking for sanctions. We would have just finished the trial.\"",
      "Immigration officers were a growing presence at courthouses during Trump\u2019s first term, prompting some pushback from judges and other local officials. Trump has gone further in his second term by repealing a policy in place since 2011 to generally avoid schools, places of worship and hospitals.",
      "Under current policy, immigration officials can make arrests \u201cin or near courthouses when they have credible information that leads them to believe the targeted alien(s) is or will be present\u201d and as long as they are not prohibited by state or local law.",
      "During the two-day hearing, Sullivan said that the lead prosecution witnessed confirmed that both the Massachusetts State police and prosecutors were aware of ICE plans to arrest Martell-Lebron.",
      "In a statement, state police said they acted appropriately after learning of the plans of ICE. \u201cAs in any situation where a member becomes aware of federal immigration enforcement, the Troopers responded appropriately by neither assisting nor obstructing the federal action,\u201d the statement said.",
      "James Borghesani, a spokesman for the Suffolk County District Attorney Kevin Hayden said \u201cwe were dismayed and surprised when our prosecution of Wilson Martell-Lebron was interrupted by ICE apprehending him in the middle of his trial.\"",
      "\u201cAny claim that we were aware of an attempt to prevent Mr Martell-Lebron from exercising his right to a trial is false.,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cIt was our intention to try Mr. Martell-Lebron and hold him accountable for the crimes alleged in the complaint. Federal authorities should not have detained him and interfered with our efforts to hold him accountable.\u201d",
      "The contempt case has been referred to the Suffolk district attorney\u2019s office and a spokesman there said they were looking into it.",
      "During Trump's first term, the judicial system in the state wrestled with how to respond to ICE.",
      "Two district attorneys in Massachusetts sued the federal government in 2019 seeking to prevent arrests at courthouses but dropped the case when former President Joe Biden took office.",
      "Newton District Judge Shelley Joseph also faced charges - which were later dropped \u2014 of helping a man who was living in the U.S. illegally evade an immigration enforcement agent. The charges were dropped after she agreed to refer herself to a state agency that investigates allegations of misconduct by members of the bench.",

      "LOS ANGELES -- As the deadline to strike a deal over TikTok approaches this week, President Donald Trump has signaled that he is confident his administration can broker an agreement with ByteDance, the social media app's China-based parent company.",
      "Speaking with reporters on Air Force One late Sunday, Trump said that \u201cthere\u2019s tremendous interest in Tiktok.\" He added that he would \u201clike to see TikTok remain alive.\u201d The president's comments came less than one week before an April deadline requiring ByteDance to divest or face a ban in the United States.",
      "\u201cWe have a lot of potential buyers,\u201d Trump said.",
      "Trump also said that the administration is \u201cdealing with China\u201d who \u201calso want it because they may have something to do with it.\u201d Last week, Trump said he would consider a reduction in tariffs on China if that country\u2019s government approves a sale of TikTok\u2019s operations in the U.S.",
      "Questions about the fate of the popular video sharing app have continued to linger since a law requiring ByteDance\u2019s divestment took effect on Jan. 19. After taking office, Trump gave TikTok a 75-day reprieve by signing an executive order that delayed enforcement of the statute until April 5.",
      "During his first term, Trump tried to ban TikTok on national security grounds, which was halted by the courts before his administration negotiated a sale of the platform that eventually failed to materialize. He changed his position on the popular app during last year\u2019s presidential election and has credited the platform with helping him win more young voters.",
      "\u201cI won the young vote by 36 points. Republicans generally don't do very well with the young vote,\u201d he said Sunday. \u201cI think a lot of it could have been TikTok.\u201d",
      "Trump has said that the deadline on a TikTok deal could be extended further if needed. He previously proposed terms in which the U.S. would have a 50% stake in a joint venture. The administration hasn\u2019t provided details on what that type of deal would entail.",
      "TikTok and ByteDance have not publicly commented on the talks. It\u2019s also unclear if ByteDance has changed its position on selling TikTok, which it said early last year it does not plan to do.",
      "If TikTok is not sold to an approved buyer by April 5, the original law that bans it nationwide would once again go into effect. However, the deadline for the executive order doesn\u2019t appear to be set in stone and the president has reiterated it could be extended further if needed.",
      "Trump\u2019s order came a few days after the Supreme Court unanimously upheld a federal law that required ByteDance to divest or be banned in January. The day after the ruling, TikTok went dark for U.S. users and came back online after Trump vowed to stall the ban.",
      "During his first term, Trump tried to ban TikTok on national security grounds, which was halted by the courts before his administration negotiated a sale of the platform that eventually failed to materialize. He changed his position on the popular app during last year\u2019s presidential election and has credited the platform with helping him win more young voters.",
      "The decision to keep TikTok alive through an executive order has received some scrutiny, but it has not faced a legal challenge in court.",
      "Although it\u2019s unclear if ByteDance plans to sell TikTok, several potential bidders have come forward in the past few months.",
      "Aides for Vice President JD Vance, who was tapped to oversee a potential deal, have reached out to some parties, such as the artificial intelligence startup Perplexity AI, to get additional details about their bids, according to a person familiar with the matter. In January, Perplexity AI presented ByteDance with a merger proposal that would combine Perplexity\u2019s business with TikTok\u2019s U.S. operation.",
      "Other potential bidders include a consortium organized by billionaire businessman Frank McCourt, which recently recruited Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian as a strategic adviser. Investors in the consortium say they\u2019ve offered ByteDance $20 billion in cash for TikTok\u2019s U.S. platform. And if successful, they plan to redesign the popular app with blockchain technology they say will provide users with more control over their online data.",
      "Jesse Tinsley, the founder of the payroll firm Employer.com, says he too has organized a consortium, which includes the CEO of the video game platform Roblox, and is offering ByteDance more than $30 billion for TikTok.",
      "Trump said in January that Microsoft was also eyeing the popular app. Other interested parties include Trump\u2019s former Treasury secretary Steve Mnuchin and Rumble, the video site popular with some conservatives and far-right groups. In a post on X last March, Rumble said it was ready to join a consortium of parties interested in purchasing TikTok and serving as a tech partner for the company.",

      "NEW YORK -- Gadgets sold without batteries. Toys sold in slimmed-down boxes or no packaging at all. More household goods that shoppers need to assemble themselves.",
      "These are some of the ways consumer product companies are retooling their wares to reduce costs and avoid raising prices as President Donald Trump levies new import taxes on key trading partners as well as some materials used by American manufacturers.",
      "The economic environment in which the president has imposed, threatened and occasionally postponed repeated rounds of tariffs is more precarious than during his first term. U.S. consumers are feeling tapped out after several years of inflation. Businesses say tariffs add to their expenses and eat into their profits, but they are wary of losing sales if they try to pass all of the increase on to customers.",
      "Instead, some companies are exploring cost-cutting options, both ones that consumers likely would notice in time \u2014 remember \u201cshrinkflation?\u201d \u2014 and ones that exist too far down the supply chain for them to see. The changes may help minimize price increases yet won't be enough in every case to offset them completely.",
      "These are some of the strategies retailers and brands have in mind:",
      "After putting an extra 20% tariff on all goods from China, as well as a 25% tariff on imported steel, aluminum and automobiles, Trump said he would announce on Wednesday the targets of \u201creciprocal tariffs\u201d that mirror the taxes all other nations apply to certain U.S. exports.",
      "He argues the tariffs will spur domestic manufacturing, among other goals.",
      "Also on the horizon: twice-delayed tariffs on most goods from Canada and Mexico, and duties on copper, lumber and pharmaceutical drugs.",
      "Kimberly Kirkendall, president of supply-chain consulting firm International Resource Development, has told clients \u2014 U.S. makers of shelving, home goods and food products \u2014 that given all the uncertainty, this is not the time for long-term moves like seeking factories outside of China.",
      "She encouraged them to focus on the short term, particularly the need to scrutinize product lines from every angle for possible savings.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019ve got to collaborate and work together with your suppliers in this situation to be able to bring costs down,\" Kirkendall said.",
      "Sourcing concerns are not only a worry for big companies that rely on Chinese manufacturers. Sasha Iglehart, founder of a small online clothing company called Shirt Story, has a collection of upcycled men\u2019s shirts that sell for around $235. She said she typically gets her vintage buttons from an Austrian supplier and knows Trump has talked about taxing goods from the European Union.",
      "\u201cI will continue to look for local vendors and collectors here in the States as back up,\u201d said Iglehart, whose company is based in Connecticut.",
      "For many companies, evaluating which components or details they can remove from their products or replace with less expensive ones is the go-to move for absorbing the potential financial hit from tariffs.",
      "Los Angeles-based toy company Abacus Brands Inc., which designs science kits and other educational toys, has most of its products made in China. By using slightly thinner paper in an 80-page project book that comes with two of its kits, the company expects to avert a $10 retail price increase, President Steve Rad said.",
      "\u201cThree or 4 cents here,\u201d Rad said. \u201cSeven or 6 cents there. Two more pennies over there. All of a sudden, you've made up the difference.\u201d",
      "Aurora World Inc., known for its plush pets and toy vehicles, is looking at using fewer paint colors as a way to counteract tariff costs, according to Gabe Higa, managing director of the California company's toy division. All of Aurora World's toys come from factories in China.",
      "\u201cThis is something that makes it a little bit simpler so that there\u2019s less manual labor involved or less material cost,\u201d Higa said. \u201c(It) doesn't have a lot of incremental value so it's easy to take away.\u201d",
      "The company still may have to raise prices as long as the new tariffs are in effect, he said.",
      "Tweaking or reducing product packaging is another area where importers may cut back and carries the advantage of possibly appealing to eco-conscious customers.",
      "Basic Fun CEO Jay Foreman, whose company markets classic toys like Tonka trucks, Lincoln Logs and Care Bears, said he is presenting retailers with three different packaging options and asking them to decide which ones they prefer for the trucks and some other products that will be in stores next spring.",
      "The first is the current packaging, which consists of a box with a big open window that lets customers see what's inside. The second option: no box, just a tray attached to the bottom of toys to hold them in place on shelves. The third: unwrapped but affixed with a simple paper price tag that features brand information.",
      "The second-tier packaging would reduce the toy company's cost per item by $1.25, and the package-free version would yield savings of $1.75, Foreman said. Both would diminish the appeal of the products and would not come close to canceling out the tariff on goods made in China, Foreman said.",
      "He said he would make pricing decisions later this week after Trump provides details about his planned reciprocal tariffs.",
      "To further reduce its production costs, Abacus Brands is thinking of switching from plastic to cardboard for the package inserts that keep toy parts in place. Cardboard trays cost 7 cents per unit compared to 30 cents for the plastic version, according to Rad.",
      "The change requires finding a new factory to make the inserts, a move that did not make financial sense before now, he said. The various tariff-related modifications should be effective for fall and holiday deliveries to stores, Rad said.",
      "\u201cThe compromises we\u2019re making are things that do not matter to the consumer,\u201d he said.",
      "Shoppers will likely have to assemble more of their products at home as companies look to reduce shipping costs, according to Kirkendall of International Resource Development.",
      "One of her clients manufactures self-watering planters that are made in China. The product is undergoing a redesign so it can be shipped as separate nesting components instead of fully assembled.",
      "Companies also are reevaluating the pieces of their products that are essential or extra. Chris Bajda, managing partner at online wedding gift retailer Groomsday, said accessories like batteries and decorative gift boxes may end up in the latter category.",
      "\u201cWe now carefully assess what\u2019s truly necessary and avoid including items that don\u2019t serve a functional purpose for the customer,\u201d Bajda said.",
      "Reducing the size or weight of products without lowering prices proliferated as a business practice from 2021 through 2024 as companies grappled with rising costs for ingredients, packaging, labor and transportation.",
      "Edgar Dworsky, a consumer advocate and former assistant attorney general in Massachusetts, suspects the makers of consumer goods will embrace shrinkflation again to hide costs given the blast of new tariffs. The additional import tax on Canadian soft lumber, for example, might show up in smaller toilet paper rolls, he said.",
      "\u201cShrinkflation has been a little quiet\u201d in the last few months, Dworksy said. \u201cBut I would expect to see both price increases and product shrinkage.\"",

    "story": [
      "The Supreme Court will hear arguments in a South Carolina case over whether states can cut off Medicaid funding to Planned Parenthood",
      "WASHINGTON -- There are just two Planned Parenthood clinics in South Carolina, but every year they take hundreds of low-income patients who need things like contraception, cancer screenings and pregnancy testing.",
      "The organization has long been at the center of the debate over abortion, but its clinics across the U.S. also provide a range of other services. In South Carolina, Medicaid patients often seek out Planned Parenthood because they often have difficulty finding a doctor who accepts the publicly funded insurance.",
      "A case coming before the Supreme Court from South Carolina on Wednesday could upend that option. That's because the state's Republican governor, Henry McMaster, is pushing to block any public health care dollars from going to Planned Parenthood.",
      "Federal law already prohibits Medicaid money from going to pay for abortions, with very limited exceptions, and South Carolina now bans almost all abortions around six weeks after conception.",
      "\u201cThis case is not about abortion. This case is about general health care,\u201d said Katherine Farris, chief medical officer at Planned Parenthood South Atlantic.",
      "Still, Republican leaders in conservative-led states have long said that no public health care dollars should go to an organization that provides abortions, and states should instead be able to direct that money as they choose. A few states already have cut Medicaid funding to Planned Parenthood and more could follow if South Carolina prevails.",
      "\u201cThe people in this state do not want their tax money to go to that organization,\u201d McMaster said.",
      "The Trump administration is joining South Carolina for the arguments on Wednesday, which are playing out against the backdrop of a wider push by abortion opponents to defund Planned Parenthood.",
      "Health care advocates, meanwhile, say the effects of the case transcend abortion. The legal question at its center is whether Medicaid patients can sue over their legal right to choose their own qualified provider.",
      "The American Cancer Society and other public-health groups say in court papers that lawsuits are the only real way that patients can assert those rights. Losing the ability to go to court would hurt their access to care, especially in rural areas.",
      "\u201cIf no one is able to enforce the statute or no one\u2019s willing to enforce the statute at the federal level, then it\u2019s a right on paper only,\u201d said Julian Polaris, a lawyer who regularly advises state Medicaid programs and health care providers. States could also move to restrict access to treatments like gender-affirming care if the court sides with South Carolina, he said.",
      "One in five American women of reproductive age is now enrolled in the Medicaid program, said Heidi Allen, an associate professor at Columbia University. This means that finding providers who can offer quality family planning services \u2014 a requirement for Medicaid \u2014 is crucial for meeting the needs of those patients.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s concerning that states would eliminate a site of care for politically motivated reasons, \u201cAllen said.",
      "The case stretches back to 2018, before the Supreme Court overturned the nationwide right to abortion, when McMaster first moved to cut Planned Parenthood funding in a fulfillment of a campaign promise. He signed an executive order removing Planned Parenthood from a list of providers for things like birth control, and sexually transmitted disease testing.",
      "\u201cThere are plenty of good organizations that provide maternal health advice, counseling and care and we need more of those,\u201d McMaster said last week.",
      "His order was blocked in court, but since then judges have ruled in favor of similar moves in Texas and Missouri, said John Bursch, an attorney for the conservative group Alliance Defending Freedom.",
      "\u201cAt the highest level, this case is about whether states have the flexibility to direct Medicaid moneys to best benefit low-income women and families,\u201d he said.",
      "He acknowledged that a win for South Carolina could curtail other Medicaid lawsuits, but suggested that could be good for the program overall because it would mean less money going to legal fees. There is also an administrative appeals process available, he said.",
      "\u201cNo one is losing their access to health care clinics,\u201d Busch said. If the state is allowed to cut off Planned Parenthood, Medicaid patients could go to one of 200 other publicly funded health care clinics in the state, he said.",
      "In South Carolina, $90,000 in Medicaid funding goes to Planned Parenthood every year \u2014 a tiny fraction of a percentage point of the state\u2019s total Medicaid spending.",
      "Most counties in the state have already been federally designated as having too few primary care providers, said Amalia Luxardo, CEO of the South Carolina-based Women\u2019s Rights and Empowerment Network. Fourteen of the state\u2019s counties have no practicing OB-GYN physicians and five other counties have just one, she said, meaning many women already have to travel longer distances to find the right provider.",
      "Planned Parenthood has flexible hours and can get appointments scheduled quickly, factors that bring in patients from around the state, she said.",
      "\u201cWe are already in a health care crisis,\u201d said Luxardo, whose group has filed court briefs supporting Planned Parenthood. \u201cAnd when decisions like these negatively impact our constituents, the crisis is going to only increase.\u201d",

      "Packed pews, rollicking singing and emotional devotions have marked Lent worship services at Notre Dame d'Haiti, the Catholic church at the heart of the largest Haitian diaspora in the United States",
      "MIAMI -- Packed pews, rollicking singing and emotional devotions have marked Lent worship services at Notre Dame d'Haiti, the Catholic church at the heart of the largest Haitian diaspora in the United States. For a community caught in the crossfire of growing violence in their island homeland and disappearing humanitarian protections in the U.S., clinging to faith in God is one of the few lifelines left.",
      "\u201cWe believe in him. We pray for possibilities,\u201d said Kettelene Fevrier. She fled Haiti two years ago under a temporary humanitarian program created by the Biden administration and canceled by Trump's, effective later in April.",
      "At the weekend Mass closing a Lent revival program, Fevrier sang with the choir that kept more than a thousand congregants dancing in the aisles well past midnight. Singing is praying, she said, and she has two main intentions.",
      "\u201cFirst, that I stay here,\u201d she said. \u201cSecond, that God will lead me on the right path.\u201d",
      "Among those swaying to the Creole hymns was Sandina Jean, an asylum-seeker who fled Haiti in 2023. In her increasingly gang-controlled homeland, such a celebration would be hard to safely hold, she said.",
      "\u201cHaiti is getting worse. We don\u2019t have a home to go back to,\u201d Jean said. \u201cWhen you pray, when you come to Mass, it helps you to keep moving.\u201d",
      "Notre Dame d'Haiti was founded nearly 50 years ago as a mission of the Catholic Church in Little Haiti, a neighborhood near downtown Miami that grew as people fled waves of turmoil. About half a million Haitians live in Florida, making greater Miami by far their largest home away from home.",
      "\u201cNotre Dame d'Haiti is the point of rallying of this community,\u201d said the Rev. Reginald Jean-Mary, who has led the parish since 2004. \u201cWe accompany Haitian migrants to integrate in U.S. life.\u201d",
      "Today, their greatest need is a sense of peace.",
      "\u201cPeople are very desperate, broken, hopeless and at the same time, they continue to believe,\" Jean-Mary said.",
      "The gangs that control the vast majority of Haiti\u2019s capital, Port-au-Prince, have stepped up the attacks that have killed thousands of people across the country and left more than one million homeless. Sixty thousand were displaced in a single month \u2014 a record \u2014 according to a late March United Nations report.",
      "So growing numbers of Haitians have fled to the United States. More than 200,000 came under a \u201chumanitarian parole\u201d program created in late 2022 that the Department of Homeland Security said it would revoke in late April.",
      "Earlier this year, the U.S. government also announced that in August it would end \u201ctemporary protected status\u201d for about half a million Haitians. Their status had been renewed by the Biden administration, which had widely expanded that type of humanitarian visa.",
      "Some Notre Dame congregants felt that these new arrivals strained available resources \u2014 and voted for President Donald Trump, whose immigration policies have found support among many in Miami\u2019s long-established Latino communities, too.",
      "But most congregants are still stepping up to help their compatriots who often sold what little they had in Haiti to take advantage of legal protections in the United States, Jean Suffrant said. He leads the Pierre Toussaint Leadership and Learning Center, Notre Dame\u2019s social services hub, which offers free day care, job training, and language and tech classes.",
      "Last week, one immigration session \u2014 held by Catholic Legal Services on church grounds \u2014 lasted until 1 a.m. because so many people lined up, desperate for advice, Suffrant said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s never been this bad\u201d for Haitians in the U.S. and on the island, he said. \u201cWhat a heavy burden, being told you\u2019re no longer allowed in a country that welcomed you.\u201d",
      "Octavius Aime said the new arrivals\u2019 difficulties affect the entire community, which he\u2019s seen grow over 40 years at Notre Dame. Many are terrified to lose their work permits, which came with humanitarian protections, since their U.S. salaries are lifelines for families in Haiti.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re hurting,\u201d Aime said. \"We are so worried, we don\u2019t know what to do.\u201d",
      "The uncertainty makes it especially important to gather and uplift all Haitians at events like the revival, at which Aime volunteered. It centered on the biblical story of the Jewish people\u2019s miraculous escape from slavery in Egypt after Moses parted the Red Sea.",
      "The event\u2019s motto was that nobody can close a door opened by God \u2014 or \u201cBondye\u201d in Creole, which is derived from the French for \u201cgood God.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe all need it at this moment,\u201d Savio Magloire said of the biblical message as he and his fiancee watched Mass projected on a screen outside the packed church. A few folding chairs were set up under the palms.",
      "In normal times, the grounds would be full with the overflow crowd, but now many are too afraid because of their immigration status to be seen in public, said Sandra Monestime, who was sitting near Magloire.",
      "She\u2019s been coming to Notre Dame for more than 40 years, since she was a teen, and trusts that the intergenerational congregation with more than three dozen ministry groups will survive this latest period of turmoil because it\u2019s \u201clike family.\u201d",
      "Dressed in bright white with soft pink flourishes, a youth group called \u201cmimers\u201d \u2014 a Haitian tradition, they mime some of the liturgy through dance \u2014 led the Mass entrance processional. The children are both U.S.-born and new arrivals, coordinator Asencia Selmon said.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s what the church brings,\u201d Selmon said, of youth participation. \u201cWe help them to be involved in church, not only spiritually but socially. When the priests preach, they show people not to despair.\u201d",
      "That\u2019s the message that Helene Auguste, a parishioner for the past 40 years, tries to convey to her brother, a teacher in Haiti. Every time the phone rings, she fears it\u2019s with news he was killed in the escalating violence.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no life for the people of Haiti,\u201d Auguste said, adding only the power of prayer remains. \u201cNow you can\u2019t talk to any people, you speak to God.\u201d",
      "And speak \u2014 and sing, and dance \u2014 to God is just what the congregants of Notre Dame do.",
      "At the closing revival event, the faithful had lined up before 5 p.m. to enter the church \u2014 to get splashed, one by one, with holy water by a visiting Haitian priest. Eucharistic adoration followed, then a more than four-hour-long Mass and a reenactment of the ancient Israelites crossing the Red Sea to the promised land.",
      "That's when music surged, and the faithful jumped to their feet, singing, as the celebrating priests pumped fists, clapped and swung to the rhythm.",
      "Even the ushers, demurely dressed in white shirts, started rocking to the beat.",
      "\u201cIf you want a stronger faith, an energizer, you come here,\u201d Suzie Aristide, an usher, said. \u201cThen you get out and you\u2019re ready \u2014 your soul, your body, your mind. That\u2019s what we are: our faith.\u201d",

      "Oscar-winning filmmaker Oliver Stone is set to testify to Congress about thousands of newly released government documents surrounding the assassination of President John F. Kennedy",
      "Oscar-winning director Oliver Stone, whose 1991 film \u201cJFK\u201d portrayed President John F. Kennedy's assassination as the work of a shadowy government conspiracy, is set to testify to Congress on Tuesday about thousands of newly released government documents surrounding the killing.",
      "Scholars say the files that President Donald Trump ordered to be released showed nothing undercutting the conclusion that a lone gunman killed Kennedy. Many documents were previously released but contained newly removed redactions, including Social Security numbers, angering people whose personal information was disclosed.",
      "The first hearing of the House Task Force on the Declassification of Federal Secrets comes five decades after the Warren Commission investigation concluded that Lee Harvey Oswald, a 24-year-old former Marine, acted alone in fatally shooting Kennedy as his motorcade finished a parade route in downtown Dallas on Nov. 22, 1963.",
      "Republican Rep. Anna Paulina Luna of Florida, who chairs the task force, said last month that she wants to work with writers and researchers to help solve \u201cone of the biggest cold case files in U.S. history.\u201d Scholars and historians haven't viewed the assassination as a cold case, viewing the evidence for Oswald as a lone gunman as strong.",
      "Stone's \u201cJFK\u201d was nominated for eight Oscars, including best picture, and won two. It grossed more than $200 million but was also dogged by questions about its factuality.",
      "The last formal congressional investigation of Kennedy's assassination ended in 1978, when a House committee issued a report concluding that the Soviet Union, Cuba, organized crime, the CIA and the FBI weren't involved, but Kennedy \u201cprobably was assassinated as a result of a conspiracy.\u201d In 1976, a Senate committee said it had not uncovered enough evidence \u201cto justify a conclusion that there was a conspiracy.\u201d",
      "The Warren Commission, appointed by Kennedy's successor, President Lyndon B. Johnson, concluded that Oswald fired on Kennedy's motorcade from a sniper's perch on the sixth floor of the Texas School Book Depository, where Oswald worked. Police arrested Oswald within 90 minutes, and two days later, Jack Ruby, a nightclub owner, shot Oswald during a jail transfer broadcast on live television.",
      "For Tuesday's hearing, the task force also invited Jefferson Morley and James DiEugenio, who both have written books arguing for conspiracies behind the assassination. Morley is editor of the JFK Facts blog and vice president of the Mary Ferrell Foundation, a repository for files related to the assassination. He has praised Luna as being open to new information surrounding the killing.",

      "The marquee race Tuesday is for a swing seat on the Wisconsin Supreme Court, a technically nonpartisan election that has drawn at least $90 million in spending. Trump and billionaire adviser Elon Musk are backing conservative judge Brad Schimel while progressive billionaires and Democrats support liberal Susan Crawford.",
      "Two Republican-friendly Florida congressional seats could give the GOP some breathing room in the narrowly divided chamber. But Democrats in both districts have far outraised their GOP counterparts, and national Republicans have been publicly concerned in particular about the race to replace Mike Waltz, now Trump's national security adviser.",
      "Here are the places to watch as the vote results are reported on election night:",
      "In any statewide election in Wisconsin, Democrats tend to win by large margins in the populous counties of Milwaukee and Dane (home of Madison). But the size of that win is usually a big factor in who wins statewide, especially in a close contest.",
      "In 2024, Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris carried Milwaukee with 68% of the vote and Dane with 75% while narrowly losing statewide. That same night, Democratic U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin ran about 2 percentage points ahead of Harris in both counties and narrowly won reelection.",
      "In 2023, the Democratic Party-backed Supreme Court candidate Janet Protasiewicz received 73% of the vote in Milwaukee and 82% of the vote in Dane and went on to win statewide by an 11-percentage-point margin.",
      "Republicans tend to do well in the suburban Milwaukee counties of Washington, Ozaukee and Waukesha \u2014 the so-called \u201cWOW\u201d counties. A strong Republican showing in these counties can help counter the Democratic advantage in urban areas. Republican candidates have carried all three counties in every major statewide election going back to at least 2016.",
      "Republican candidates tend to win Brown County, which is home to Green Bay, but not by huge blowouts. Trump carried the county in all three of his presidential campaigns with between 52% and 53% of the vote.",
      "But since the 2016 election, there have been two Democrats who carried Brown County and went on to win statewide: Tony Evers in his bid for governor in 2018 and more recently Protasiewicz in her 2023 state Supreme Court race.",
      "A Democrat can still win statewide without winning Brown (such as Democrat Joe Biden in 2020, Evers\u2019 reelection in 2022 and all three of Baldwin\u2019s U.S. Senate runs). But if they do carry Brown, it\u2019s probably going to be a rough night for Republicans.",
      "Sauk County, northwest of Madison, is a competitive area in statewide elections that usually ends up supporting the Democratic candidate, albeit by slim margins. It falls somewhere in the middle of Wisconsin\u2019s 72 counties in terms of population, and the margins are usually so small that statewide elections aren\u2019t typically won or lost in Sauk.",
      "Democrats or Democratic-backed candidates had a long winning streak in Sauk, having carried the county in eight of the last 10 major statewide elections. But the two exceptions are notable: Trump carried Sauk in 2016 and 2024, when he won Wisconsin and the White House.",
      "While Sauk won\u2019t likely place a decisive role in Tuesday\u2019s elections, a victory there by a Republican-backed candidate may be a good sign for the party statewide.",
      "Democrats are encouraged by the strong fundraising performances of their nominees to replace Waltz and former Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz, but the special elections take place in two congressional districts that have long been safe Republican territory.",
      "Trump received about 68% of the vote in 2024 in the Florida Panhandle\u2019s 1st Congressional District, slightly outperforming the 66% Gaetz received in his reelection bid. In the 6th Congressional District on the Atlantic coast, Trump received roughly 65% of the vote, just behind the 67% Waltz received in his final House reelection bid.",
      "The four counties that make up the 1st District have voted for Republican presidential candidates almost continually for the past 60 years. Only Walton County went for a Democrat on one occasion since 1960, although all four voted for Democrat-turned-independent candidate George Wallace in 1968. Today, the part of Walton County that falls within the 1st District is the most reliably Republican of the four counties.",
      "Republican presidential candidates have carried all six counties in the 6th District for the last four presidential elections. The Republican winning streak in some of the counties stretches back for decades before that. Lake County, for instance, hasn\u2019t supported a Democrat for president since Franklin Roosevelt in 1944. Trump and Waltz performed best in Putnam County, where they both received about 74% of the vote.",
      "If Democrats manage to pull off upsets in either the 1st or 6th districts, the first indications may be in their best performing counties.",
      "Given the Republican advantage in both districts, the Democrats' best areas are still places where Republicans performed well. In the 1st District, Trump and Gaetz did comparatively the worst in Escambia County, although they still received 59% and 57% of the county vote, respectively.",
      "In the 6th District, Democrats may do best in Volusia County, where Trump received 58% and Waltz received about 60%. Republican presidential candidates have carried Volusia in the last four elections, but the area used to be more friendly territory for Democrats, who won the county for six consecutive elections from 1992 through 2008.",

      "A committee in the California legislature plans to vote on bills Tuesday that would restrict transgender athletes from participating in girls sports",
      "SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- The battle over transgender athletes' participation in youth sports will come to California on Tuesday as state lawmakers debate two bills aimed at keeping trans kids and teens off sports teams consistent with their gender identity.",
      "One of the proposals would reverse a 2013 law allowing students to participate on a sex-segregated sports team that aligns with their gender identity, regardless of the gender listed on their records. The other would require the California Interscholastic Federation, the governing body for high school sports, to adopt rules banning students whose sex was assigned male at birth from participating on a girls school sports team.",
      "The Republican-backed bills are expected to draw a crowd to the state Assembly\u2019s Committee on Arts, Entertainment, Sports and Tourism hearing, where lawmakers in the Democrat-controlled legislature will decide whether to advance them. Conservative political commentator Matt Walsh and a student-athlete who says a trans runner took her spot on her high school's varsity cross country team are scheduled to testify in support of a ban.",
      "The hearing comes a day after Transgender Day of Visibility. It also comes weeks after Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom made waves and angered party allies when, speaking on his podcast, he questioned the fairness of transgender athletes participating in girls sports. Newsom hasn't directly called for a reversal of state law and generally does not comment on pending legislation.",
      "Democratic Assemblymember Chris Ward, the committee chair who leads the legislative LGBTQ+ caucus, said he hopes the hearing will \u201cprovide a balanced setting where both sides can present their arguments and engage in rational deliberation.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhether these bills advance or not, my hope is that after Tuesday\u2019s hearing, we can shift our focus back to real-life, pressing issues impacting Californians every day\u2014such as making the cost of living more affordable\u2014instead of furthering divisive culture wars,\u201d he said in a statement.",
      "At least 24 states have laws on the books barring transgender women and girls from participating in certain women\u2019s or girls sports competitions. Judges have temporarily blocked bans in Arizona, Idaho and Utah. In New Hampshire and West Virginia, students who sued those states over bans were allowed to compete.",
      "At the federal level, President Donald Trump signed an executive order last month aimed at barring transgender athletes from participating in girls and women's sports.",
      "The bans are part of a nationwide battle over transgender rights, with some states also imposing bans on gender-affirming care and requiring schools to share students\u2019 gender identity with parents without the students\u2019 consent.",
      "Education Secretary Linda McMahon weighed in on California's proposed ban. She sent Newsom a letter last week, saying his remarks on his podcast caught her attention and requesting he clarify his stance and support the bill that would reverse the 2013 law.",
      "\u201cTake a stand on your convictions,\u201d she wrote. \"Be clear about the harms of gender confusion. Protect female spaces. Do not encourage children to seek permanent medical interventions to their sex. Inform parents.\"",
      "The U.S. Department of Education also announced an investigation last week into the state education department over a law banning school districts from requiring teachers and staff to notify parents if a student changes their gender identity at school.",

    "story": [
      "Donald Trump says tariffs are coming. That message from the US president has been consistent.",
      "But what tariffs and when? Import taxes have come so thick and fast since he took office that it can be hard to keep track.",
      "Trump has already raised duties on Chinese imports, as well as steel, aluminium and some goods from Canada and Mexico. Higher levies on cars are due to go into effect this week.",
      "We're now waiting for Trump to unveil the details of his plan for a wider set of tariffs, which his team has spent the last few weeks developing.",
      "The White House is calling it \"Liberation Day\". So what might we learn on Wednesday?",
      "World braces as Trump set to announce sweeping tariffs",
      "How big are the tariffs?",
      "The White House has not said how high the tariffs could go, although various possible rates have been floated by analysts.",
      "On the campaign trail last year, Trump backed a 10% across-the-board tariff on all imports coming into the US, sometimes suggesting that could be 20% - even 60% on imports from China.",
      "Once in office, he introduced the idea of \"reciprocal\" tariffs, suggesting the rates could vary country by country.",
      "\"Very simply, it's if they charge us, we charge them,\" he said in February, shortly before he ordered officials to develop such a plan.",
      "The White House almost immediately complicated the picture, noting that their recommendations would reflect not just tariffs but also other policies they believe are unfair to US businesses, like Value Added Tax (VAT).",
      "It has a led to a scramble, as businesses and political leaders try to get a sense of how big a new tax their products might be facing; and how whatever is announced on Wednesday will interact with other duties, such as those on steel and aluminium, already put into effect by Trump.",
      "Officials in Europe, for example, are preparing for a double-digit tariff on their exports. Trump earlier this year said he planned to hit goods from the bloc with a 25% import tax.",
      "Which countries could be affected?",
      "The Trump administration has not confirmed which countries will be hit, although it has trailed Wednesday's announcement as a sweeping one.",
      "On Sunday, the president said the new tariffs could apply to \"all countries\", suggesting a possible return to the across-the-board tariff he backed in the campaign.",
      "It dashed hopes in some countries, such as the UK, that thought they might float under the radar, though many are still hoping eventually to work out some sort of deal.",
      "But it is still unclear to what extent the tariffs will be universally applied or more targeted.",
      "Last month, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said efforts were focused on the \"Dirty 15\" - the 15% of countries that account for the bulk of trade with the US and impose tariffs or other rules that put US firms at a disadvantage.",
      "The Office of the US Trade Representative, as it prepared to craft recommendations, identified the countries in which it was  \"particularly interested\".",
      "They were Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, the European Union, India, Indonesia, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, Russia, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Switzerland, Taiwan, Thailand, Turkey, the UK and Vietnam.",
      "Trump himself has reserved some of his harshest criticism for historic allies and major trade partners, such as Canada and the EU.",
      "\"Friend has been, oftentimes, much worse than foe,\" he declared last week.",
      "What impact will the tariffs have?",
      "Tariffs are taxes on imports. So the big question is, who will pay?",
      "Technically, there is a simple answer: the US firms bringing in the goods are the companies that will face the bill, especially if the White House starts levying the tariffs \"immediately\", as spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt suggested on Tuesday.",
      "But the larger the tariffs are, the more firms will be looking for ways to offset those costs, either by changing suppliers, pushing business partners to share the burden - or by raising prices for Americans.",
      "Many firms have said they are already preparing for that step. But it is a risky game because if companies raise prices too much, buyers will simply stay away.",
      "The dynamics have raised the risks of an economic recession both in the US - and far outside its borders, where many firms rely on US sales.",
      "Trump says companies looking to avoid tariffs can simply do their business in the US, but that's not an immediate, or easy fix, given the high costs of hiring and setting up factories.",
      "Introduce currency swings and retaliation by other countries into the mix, and the repercussions of Trump's bid to reset global trade balances are likely to prove hard to predict long after Wednesday's announcement."

    "summary": "Bills, bins, and benefits - the BBC's cost of living correspondent Kevin Peachy answers your questions on bill rises.",
    "story": [
      "A range of household bills, including council tax, water, gas and electricity have risen today.",
      "The BBC's cost of living correspondent, Kevin Peachey, has been answering your most asked questions on the price rises.",
      "Why are bills going up?",
      "Tashi and Chris asked why bills are going up.",
      "This is a very simple question, but I'm afraid the answer isn't straightforward. There are a host of reasons why bills are rising.",
      "On energy, it's the consequence of an increase in wholesale prices paid by suppliers, often owing to global events.",
      "Councils and water companies, meanwhile, say there's a desperate need to raise bills to pay for investment in services.",
      "Some bill increases are always scheduled for this time of year, to match the rate of rising prices - inflation.",
      "So another question is: what can you do about it?",
      "Consumer groups are urging people to shop around, claim everything they are entitled to, and cut back where possible.",
      "We have a guide to help you here.",
      "Is cash a better way to budget?",
      "James: I get \u00a3150 in cash out every week. It's amazing how it helps you budget things. Why don't more people try it?",
      "There is evidence of people turning to notes and coins to help them budget.",
      "Although cash use was hit during the pandemic, it has made a bit of a comeback, with many people taking the same view as James.",
      "However, there are areas in which this doesn't work.",
      "Shopping around for a better deal on essential bills is often something done online, and may require signing up to a direct debit payment. Rewards, or money off, are often also available to those who pay by card.",
      "So, it may well be that using a mix of ways to pay works best - but questions remain about access to cash and internet services among the vulnerable.",
      "Will my wage rise be eaten away by tax?",
      "Richard Kendall asked about frozen tax thresholds, which mean pay rises can see people drawn into paying higher rates of income tax.",
      "This is what is known as fiscal drag - not a phrase you'll hear talked about much, but it is important.",
      "It means that while income tax rates haven't risen, the income levels at which they are paid have been frozen, and will continue to be so until 2028.",
      "There have been rumours that the freeze could be extended, but there are no concrete plans for that as yet.",
      "So, more people are being dragged into paying higher rates of tax, or simply having a greater proportion of their income taxed.",
      "Taking a closer look at your pay slip is worthwhile, and it needs to be considered when looking at your personal budget. Experts say studying exactly how much post-tax income is coming in, and looking at it alongside your spending, is never a waste of time.",
      "And it may require you to trim some of your spending. Shopping around, or cancelling unused subscriptions are a good start, experts say.",
      "Do we just have to accept water bill increases?",
      "Colin Smith: Do we simply have to accept water bill increases because we can't shop around?",
      "Water services are different, because the 'switch for a better deal' advice simply doesn't, ahem, hold water.",
      "There is plenty of debate over why water bills are going up so much (remember some suppliers wanted bigger increases).",
      "But there are things you can do to keep your costs down, even though you can't shop around.",
      "Experts say getting a water meter fitted can reduce bills if you have relatively low usage. Water-saving shower heads, or similar, are available free from some companies.",
      "Then, there is the WaterSure scheme, which means the bill is capped for people on certain benefits, who have a medical condition, or who have a certain number of school-age children at home. You do need to apply for this help though.",
      "Does this hit the government's plans for growth?",
      "Sam Halkyard, 32, from Rotherham: How does the government expect the economy to grow with all these bill increases?",
      "Ministers are pushing their \"agenda for growth\" at every opportunity, calling for red tape to be cut to pave the way for investment.",
      "There is a delicate balancing act here. The government wants people's living standards to rise, and it wants them to spend to encourage investment by businesses.",
      "Remember, all of this comes with a background of wage rises outpacing prices, an uptick in the housing market, and some signs of hope for the wider economy.",
      "But ministers won't want to see a return of runaway inflation - the annual rise of prices - because that would inevitably lead to a rise in interest rates, and higher borrowing costs for businesses and individuals.",
      "So, outside of this, you are seeing the government push ahead with some big, long-term investment projects, like road tunnels and runways.",
      "I'm single, where's help for me?",
      "Jules, 57: I'm single. My wages don't go up in April. Where's the help for us?",
      "Charities have raised the alarm specifically about people like you, Jules.",
      "Citizens Advice says that single households, including single parents, tend to spend a greater proportion of their income on household bills.",
      "As a result, there is far less wriggle room financially when bills rise.",
      "One solution is to investigate all the options that are open to you. For example, as I'm sure you already know if it includes you, there is a 25% discount on council tax, for those who live on their own.",
      "But there is, without doubt, a single person premium on the cost of living because there's only one income coming in, so it may be harder to deal with the money going out.",
      "What you can do about the seven bills going up this weekThree ways to cushion the blow of bill risesWarning bill rises hit single parents hardest",
      "What you can do about the seven bills going up this week",
      "Three ways to cushion the blow of bill rises",
      "Warning bill rises hit single parents hardest",
      "What's happening with energy standing charge?",
      "David Bosworth and Jeff Rumble asked how the energy standing charge applies to bills.",
      "This is a household cost which many people feel is unfair - not least because there is nothing you can do about it.",
      "Standing charges are the fees charged to all billpayers to cover the cost of being connected to a gas and electricity supply. They are unaffected by the amount of energy that a household uses.",
      "After rising sharply in recent years, the average electricity standing charge actually fell from today - although it rose slightly for gas. More significantly, it varies considerably depending on where you live.",
      "The energy regulator, Ofgem, is considering reform that would allow people a choice of ways to pay - but stresses that these costs will still need to be covered.",
      "Council tax: What do I get for it?",
      "Ian Griffiths, from Flintshire, on council tax: Other than having my bin emptied once a fortnight, I don't actually have anything for the money I pay.",
      "In Wales, local authorities are increasing 2025-2026 council tax bills by between 5% and more than 9%.",
      "Ian may be stretching his point a little - local authorities provide a range of services such as street lighting, parks and care services.",
      "However, at its heart, his question highlights a common debate.",
      "Should these bill increases stay at the bare minimum because people are struggling financially, or are our local services in such desperate need of investment that council tax needs to go up above inflation?",
      "Are pensioners facing a harder hit?",
      "Lyn Nailer: Will pensioners suffer the most from these bill rises?",
      "One important point to stress here is that different people, in different areas of the country, will be affected in different ways.",
      "Water and energy bills vary depending on where you live, and the different nations of the UK have different rules on council tax and more.",
      "But the state pension is UK-wide, and the good news is that it will be going up by more than the rate of price rises from next week. The triple lock means it will increase by 4.1%.",
      "Does everyone get the full state pension? No.",
      "Does the increase mean pensioners' finances won't be stretched? Of course not.",
      "But when asked about how people will cope, ministers are inevitably pointing to this increase as evidence of how the government is helping out.",
      "What about the minimum wage increase?",
      "David and Steve pointed out that incomes are rising, including via an increase of the minimum wage.",
      "Yes, it is not all doom and gloom today.",
      "There is an increase in the minimum wage - up to \u00a312.21 an hour for over 21s - and there are increases too for younger workers and apprentices.",
      "Official figures show that average wages have been rising faster than prices. The state pension and benefits will also go up from next week.",
      "This will certainly help pay some of those bills, and you won't see the impact directly until you look at your bank balance in the coming weeks.",
      "The Treasury is also pointing to moves to freeze fuel duty and ensure the main rates of tax - income tax, VAT and employees' National Insurance - do not go up during this Parliament, as evidence of the support billpayers are receiving.",
      "Is there a silver lining?",
      "Bills may be rising - but for some people, incomes are going up too.",
      "Benefits and the state pension are going up in a week's time. Wages have also been rising at a faster pace than the rate of inflation, and the start of April also brings an increase in the minimum wage. It means:",
      "The minimum wage for over 21s, known officially as the National Living Wage, has risen by 6.7%, from \u00a311.44 to \u00a312.21 an hour. For someone working full time that equates to \u00a323,873.60 a year, up from \u00a322,368.06For 18 to 20-year-olds, the minimum wage has gone up from \u00a38.60 to \u00a310 an hour.

      "The start of April means several bills are going up, putting extra pressure on household finances.",
      "For some payments, such as energy, water or broadband, there are things you could do to reduce the impact of price rises.",
      "Here are seven ways you could be affected by this week's increases.",
      "1. Water bills",
      "Water bills for households in England and Wales are going up by \u00a310 per month on average.",
      "However, there's a lot of variation depending on your supplier.",
      "For example, the annual Southern Water bill is jumping 47% to \u00a3703, while Anglian Water customers are paying 19% more, or \u00a3626.",
      "The increases are being front-loaded for the next five years, meaning the biggest rise is coming this year.",
      "How much your bills will rise depends on a range of factors including whether households have a meter and how much water they use.",
      "Water companies in England and Wales have said the increases are needed to invest in creaking infrastructure, including sewage, and to build more reservoirs.",

      "The annual energy bill for a household using a typical amount of gas and electricity is going up by \u00a3111 a year to \u00a31,849 from April.",
      "Regulator Ofgem increased the energy price cap because of higher wholesale costs and inflation.",
      "The cap is set every three months and limits the amount suppliers can charge for each unit of gas and electricity, but not the total bill, so if you use more, you will pay more.",
      "It covers 22 million homes in England, Wales and Scotland.",
      "Standing charges - fixed fees to connect to a gas and electricity supply and vary by region - are rising again for gas but dropping for electricity, but the amount you pay depends on where you live.",
      "Ofgem is suggesting households may consider switching to a fixed tariff for a bit of stability.",
      "Read more: Fixed-price deals are not affected by the energy price cap and offer certainty for a set period. But if energy prices drop when you are on the deal, you could be stuck at a higher price.",
      "3. Council tax",
      "It is likely the tax you pay to your local authority is going up.",
      "In England, local authorities with responsibility for delivering social care can increase council tax every year by up to 4.99% without triggering a referendum or local vote.",
      "Smaller councils without social care duties can increase bills by up to 2.99%.",
      "For 2025-26, the government is allowing Birmingham, Bradford, Newham, Somerset, Trafford, and Windsor and Maidenhead to bypass the 4.99% cap, meaning residents face larger increases.",

      "In Wales, council tax rates are jumping by as much 15% in some areas. Local authorities were given \u00a3253m by the Welsh government in its draft budget, but council leaders say more money needed.",
      "Northern Ireland uses a domestic rates system instead of council tax. All of Northern Ireland's councils have reported district rate increases for the next year.",
      "Read more: There are some exemptions and discounts, for example for someone living alone and homes occupied only by students. You can also check your council tax band.",
      "4. Stamp duty",
      "House buyers in England and Northern Ireland will start paying stamp duty on properties over \u00a3125,000, instead of over \u00a3250,000.",
      "First-time buyers currently had paid no stamp duty on homes up to \u00a3425,000, but this is dropping to \u00a3300,000.",

      "5. Broadband, phone and TV licence",
      "Rule changes introduced by the telecoms regulator earlier in 2005 mean that mobile and broadband providers must now tell customers \"in pounds and pence\" about any price rises, as well as when they occur.",
      "The new rules typically only apply to new customers, so any price rise will depend on when you took your contract out, but prices often increase at this time of year.",
      "For instance, under the new rules, someone with a mobile sim-only contract with EE will see their bill go up by \u00a31.50 a month, or \u00a318 a year.",
      "But the majority of EE customers who took their contract out before 10 April 2024, will face an increase of 6.4%, which is based on the December 2024 inflation rate plus an additional charge.",
      "Similarly, most Virgin Media broadband customers will face a 7.5% rise in bills, but anyone who took out a contract after 9 January 2025 will see their monthly bill go up by \u00a33.50.",
      "The cost of a TV licence is also going up by \u00a35 to \u00a3174.50. The cost for a black and white TV is going up by \u00a31.50 to \u00a358.50.",
      "6. Car tax",
      "The standard rate of tax for cars registered after April 2017 is rising \u00a35 to \u00a3195 a year. According to the RAC, you may pay less or more if your car was first used before 2017.",
      "The exact amount for your vehicle excise duty will depend on the year your car was registered and the type of fuel it uses.",
      "One big change is that electric vehicles (EVs) will no longer be tax exempt.",
      "EVs registered from April 2025 will pay the lowest rate of \u00a310 in the first year, then move to the standard rate. The standard rate will also apply to EVs first registered after April 2017.",
      "7. Hidden tax rises",

    "summary": "Economists say the president's import taxes could result in higher prices for a range of products in the US.",
    "story": [
      "US President Donald Trump has announced and imposed a range of tariffs - or import taxes - on billions of dollars worth of goods coming into the US from some of its top trading partners.",
      "In March, tariffs on steel and aluminium imported to the US came into effect, as well as tariffs on other products from Mexico, Canada, and China specifically.",
      "In addition, Trump has promised to announce a raft of new tariffs on Wednesday which will hit \"all countries\" and he is expected to enact some previously delayed tariffs on Mexico and Canada.",
      "Then, on Thursday, tariffs on cars coming into the US will come into effect. Tariffs on certain car parts are set to start in May or later.",
      "Economists have warned these tariffs - and those introduced in response by other countries - could put prices up for American consumers.",
      "That's because the tax is paid by the domestic company importing the goods, which may choose to pass the cost on to customers, or to reduce imports, meaning fewer products are available.",
      "So which things could become more expensive?",
      "Cars",
      "The US imported about eight million cars last year - accounting for about $240bn (\u00a3186bn) in trade.",
      "Many US car companies also have operations in Mexico and Canada, set up under the terms of the longstanding free trade agreement between them.",
      "Component parts typically cross the US, Mexican and Canadian borders multiple times before a vehicle is completely assembled.",
      "The new tariffs on car parts from Canada and Mexico are exempt for now while US customs and border patrol set up a system to assess the duties.",
      "Anderson Economic Group has estimated that tariffs on parts just from Canada and Mexico could lead to costs rising by roughly $4,000-$10,000 depending on the vehicle.",
      "Experts say these costs are likely to be passed on to customers, though Trump himself has said he \"couldn't care less\" if that happens as he believes it will encourage Americans to buy American-made cars instead.",
      "What are tariffs and why is Trump using them?",
      "What are tariffs and why is Trump using them?",
      "Beer, whisky and tequila",
      "Popular Mexican beers Modelo and Corona could get more expensive for US customers if the American companies importing them pass on the increased import taxes.",
      "Meanwhile, representatives from the American, Canadian, and Mexican spirit industries argued in a joint statement that drinks like bourbon, Tennessee whiskey, tequila, and Canadian whisky \"can only be produced in their designated countries\".",
      "So, given they have to be made in those locations, supplies might be affected, leading to price rises.",
      "Trump has also threatened a 200% tariff on alcohol from the EU, which could make Spanish wine, French champagne, or German beer more expensive for Americans, though it is not clear if this will be carried out.",
      "Houses",
      "The US imports about a third of its softwood lumber from Canada each year, and that key building material could be hit by Trump's tariffs.",
      "Trump has said the US has \"more lumber than we ever use\".",
      "However, the National Association of Home Builders (NAHB) has \"serious concerns\" that the tariffs on lumber could increase the cost of building homes - which are mostly made out of wood in the US - and also put off developers building new homes.",
      "\"Consumers end up paying for the tariffs in the form of higher home prices,\" the NAHB said.",
      "Imports from the rest of the world could also be affected.",
      "On 1 March, Trump ordered an investigation into whether the US should place additional tariffs on most lumber and timber imports, regardless of their country of origin, or create incentives to boost domestic production.",
      "Findings are due towards the end of 2025.",
      "Maple syrup",
      "Canada's billion-dollar maple syrup industry accounts for 75% of global production.",
      "The majority of the sweet staple - around 90% - is produced in the province of Quebec, where the world's sole strategic reserve of maple syrup was set up 24 years ago.",
      "\"That maple syrup is going to become more expensive. And that's a direct price increase that households will face,\" said Thomas Sampson from the London School of Economics.",
      "\"If I buy goods that are domestically produced in the US, but [which use] inputs from Canada, the price of those goods is also going to go up,\" he added.",
      "Fuel prices",
      "Canada is America's largest foreign supplier of crude oil.",
      "According to the most recent official trade figures, 61% of oil imported into the US between January and November 2024 came from Canada.",
      "While the US has introduced a 25% tariff on most goods imported from Canada, Canadian energy faces a lower rate of 10%.",
      "The US doesn't have a shortage of oil, but its refineries are designed to process so-called \"heavier\" - or thicker - crude oil, which mostly comes from Canada, with some from Mexico.",
      "\"Many refineries need heavier crude oil to maximize flexibility of gasoline, diesel and jet fuel production,\" according to the American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers.",
      "That means if Canada decided to reduce crude oil exports in retaliation against US tariffs, it could push up fuel prices.",
      "Avocados",
      "Avocados thrive in the Mexican climate.",
      "Nearly 90% of the avocados consumed in the US come from Mexico.",
      "The US Agriculture Department has warned that tariffs on Mexican fruit and vegetables could increase the cost of avocados.",
      "Related dishes like guacamole could also become more expensive.",

      "Gas and electricity are often the biggest bills people face and the price cap set by the regulator is rising by 6%, so it is worth finding the best deal for you.",
      "That may include choosing a fixed rate deal, says Ms Seymour. If you charge an electric vehicle or use appliances overnight, look for a deal with a cheaper night tariff.",
      "\"We'd also recommend taking a meter reading as close to 31 March as possible to ensure you're billed the correct amount for your energy usage,\" she says.",
      "2. Cut back",
      "One surefire way to keep your bills down is to reduce what you use.",
      "Taking shorter showers and putting in a showerhead with a slower flow will save money on your water and energy bills.",

      "Smart meters for electricity and gas can also help you keep tabs on what is pushing up your energy bills most, the Energy Saving Trust says.",
      "The trust advises draught-proofing your home, including round floorboards, pipework and old extractor fans, and setting the thermostat to the lowest comfortable temperature. For most people, it says, that is between 18\u00b0C and 21\u00b0C.",
      "MoneySavingExpert says you can save money by using the principle: \"heat the human, not the home\". Using hot water bottles and electric blankets should work out cheaper than turning up the radiators.",
      "You can also change the settings on combi or conventional boilers to save money, says Martin Lewis at MoneySavingExpert.",
      "When it comes to transport bills, you can't avoid the vehicle tax rise unless you ditch the car altogether.",
      "But if you are taking the train it is also worth checking whether a railcard will help, points out Ms Seymour.",
      "\"To cut costs on rail fares, we'd recommend booking tickets in advance and splitting fares where possible,\" she says.",
      "3. Get help",
      "If you are struggling to pay your household bills, don't panic, says Richard Lane, chief client officer at the StepChange Debt Charity. He suggests creating a detailed budget that captures all your income and expenditure.",
      "\"This will allow you to get a clear picture of your finances and see how much you have leftover to pay toward any debts or make savings,\" he says.",
      "Then check what support you are entitled to.",
      "Water companies offer lower \"social\" and hardship tariffs for people on very low incomes, so it is worth calling your provider. People claiming benefits can often also get lower tariffs for broadband.",
      "\"These organisations have a regulatory responsibility to treat customers fairly and will be able to offer you tailored support,\" Mr Lane added.",
      "There is the government's Warm Home Discount, for people with high energy costs on a very low income, including Pension Credit. And people on low incomes are also eligible for a reduction in council tax.",
      "Check if you qualify for a free TV licence. If you are over 75 and on Pension Credit or live with someone who is, then you will.",
      "You may also be able to boost your income. Check which benefits you are entitled to on the independent MoneyHelper website, backed by the government, or using benefits calculators run by Policy in Practice and charities Entitledto and Turn2us.",

      "Trump has already announced a series of tariffs on steel, aluminium and vehicles coming into the US - and unlike other countries, the UK has decided not to set out plans to retaliate with tariffs of its own.",
      "But ahead of the latest round of expected tariffs, ministers are facing calls to hit back and protect UK business from the impact of Trump's taxes.",

    "summary": "Paul Marchant leaves after an allegation about his behaviour towards a woman \"in a social environment\".",
    "story": [
      "Primark boss Paul Marchant has resigned following an allegation by a woman about \"his behaviour towards her in a social environment\".",
      "Associated British Foods (ABF), which owns Primark, said following an investigation by external lawyers, Mr Marchant \"acknowledged his error of judgement and accepts that his actions fell below the standards expected\" by the business.",
      "Mr Marchant co-operated with the investigation and apologised to the individual, said ABF.",
      "The Primark boss had also been involved in a previous incident involving \"inappropriate communication\", ABF later confirmed.",
      "The company said that incident had been investigated \"some time ago\" and that \"proportionate action\" had been taken.",
      "ABF declined to provide any further details, including whether the incidents involved colleagues or individuals from outside the company. A spokesperson told the BBC this was to protect their identities as much as possible.",
      "'Immensely disappointed'",
      "Mr Marchant became chief executive of Primark in 2009, taking over from the firm's founder Arthur Ryan.",
      "In announcing Mr Marchant's resignation, George Weston, chief executive of ABF, said: \"I am immensely disappointed. Colleagues and others must be treated with respect and dignity. Our culture has to be, and is, bigger than any one individual.\"",
      "He added: \"At ABF, we believe that high standards of integrity are essential. Acting responsibly is the only way to build and manage a business over the long term.\"",
      "The company said it remains in contact with the individual \"who rightly raised her concerns and have offered her our support\".",
      "While Primark - or Penneys as it is known in Ireland - has been around since 1969 when Mr Ryan opened the first shop in Dublin, it began ramping up its overseas expansion under Mr Marchant's leadership.",
      "Its low-price clothing and rapidly changing stock won over cash-strapped but fashion-conscious younger customers. Although, according to Catherine Shuttleworth, retail analyst at the consultancy Savvy, it has got \"ubiquitous appeal\".",
      "She said: \"It has allowed access to affordable clothing for everybody and that has tied into a period of time where global supply chains have significantly changed, so that means you can access products and materials better and more easily.\"",
      "Prior to Primark, Mr Marchant worked for a number of retailers such as Debenhams, Topman and New Look. But, like his predecessor Mr Ryan, he has remained out of the spotlight.",
      "Ms Shuttleworth said Primark's leadership \"flies under the radar a bit because - it sounds a bit cheesy - they let their shops and their products do the talking\".",
      "Unlike many of its rivals, Primark resisted selling its products online before finally relenting in 2022 after Covid restrictions drove people to internet shopping. Even then, Primark only launched a click-and-collect service as opposed to offering deliveries.",
      "Like other low-cost fashion chains, Primark has been criticised for producing cheap, throwaway clothing.",
      "In a rare interview, Mr Marchant told the BBC in 2022: \"We have worked so hard and continue to work hard on ensuring that we're improving the quality and the durability of our clothing.",
      "\"We don't want customers to buy something and then discard it. We want them to buy, love and keep it in their wardrobe [and] hand it down to their friends.\"",
      "'Unsettling'",
      "Primark is a key part of the wider ABF business, contributing nearly half of the group's overall sales of \u00a320bn.",
      "However, in its most recent trading update covering the Christmas period, Primark reported a fall in sales for the UK and Ireland, which accounts for 45% of the retailer's revenues.",
      "ABF's share price fell by nearly 4% to \u00a318.64 after Monday's announcement.",
      "Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown, said Mr Marchant's departure came at a trying time for Primark.",
      "''The change at the top will be unsettling particularly given that Primark delivered a very mixed bag of results at the last count,\" she said.",
      "\"This leadership upset comes amid weaker consumer sentiment which has meant footfall at its stores has fallen - and the chain has been losing market share in the UK.\"",
      "She said that internationally the company has performed well, but added: \"There could be uncertainty ahead about the speed of expansion given the change of boss.\"",
      "Following Mr Marchant's \"immediate\" departure, ABF's finance director Eoin Tonge will become Primark's interim chief executive.",
      "The firm's financial controller, Joana Edwards, will step into Mr Tonge's role. The company said: \"Both executives have the experience to perform these roles well.\"",
      "ABF is majority-owned by the billionaire Weston family who, until 2021, owned  the department store Selfridges."

    "story": [
      "A proposed change to banking rules will increase significantly the amount of savers' money that is protected when a bank or building society goes under.",
      "The planned increase takes into account inflation since the limit was last set in 2017, the body which supervises UK banks, the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) said.",
      "If a financial institution fails, the deposit protection scheme means customers can currently claim back the first \u00a385,000 of their savings. That would rise to \u00a3110,000 under the new proposal.",
      "The plan is subject to a consultation, but if adopted the higher limit would apply from 1 December 2025.",
      "Rob Mansfield, independent financial adviser at Rootes Wealth, said uprating the limit in line with inflation was very welcome and \"great news for savers and for confidence in our banking system\".",
      "Currently, savers are protected to the tune of \u00a385,000 per person, per institution. For a joint account that means protection rises to \u00a3170,000.",
      "Savers with more than that to deposit are advised to spread their money between different banks or building societies to ensure it is covered by the compensation scheme, which is operated by the Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS).",
      "Over the 25 years since its foundation, the FSCS has paid over \u00a320bn to depositors, primarily as a result of the 2008 financial crisis.",
      "Martyn Beauchamp, chief executive of the FSCS, said it was important the limit was reviewed regularly to ensure it stayed \"appropriate and relevant\".",
      "The proposal is part of a wide-ranging consultation on deposit protection which could also see the limit on \"temporary high balance claims\" rise from \u00a31m to \u00a31.4m. That covers customers who have large amounts in an account because they are moving house or have received a payout from an insurance policy.",
      "Sam Woods, chief executive of the PRA, said customer confidence in the financial system was \"an essential foundation for economic growth\".",
      "The government has called on regulatory bodies to revise their strategies to promote economic growth.",
      "Rocio Concha, director of policy and advocacy at the consumer group Which?, described the change as \"a sensible decision\".",
      "\"At a time when the government and regulators are going for growth, this decision is a reminder that strong consumer protections and economic growth go hand in hand.\""

    "story": [
      "Thames Water has picked US private equity giant KKR as its \"preferred partner\" to buy the troubled water utility firm.",
      "The planned investment by KKR would help it deal with its mountain of debt, and Thames is aiming for the transaction to be completed in the second half of this year.",
      "Thames Water, the UK's largest water company, started to look for new investment last year after fears emerged that it could collapse or face nationalisation.",
      "The firm has been heavily criticised for sewage spills, and is also struggling to fix leaks and modernise outdated infrastructure.",
      "Thames Water serves about a quarter of the UK's population, mostly across London and parts of southern England, and employs 8,000 people.",
      "The government has previously said it is ready to take over Thames Water in the event that it cannot continue to operate, but earlier this year the company secured a \u00a33bn rescue loan to avert this possibility.",
      "Regardless of who owns the company, its water services will continue as normal.",
      "Thames said recently that it had received approaches from six firms about taking a stake in the business.",
      "It will now enter the next stage of the investment process with KKR, one of the world's largest private equity firms with $160bn of investments globally. KKR is already a shareholder in another UK water provider, Northumbrian Water.",
      "Thames did not say how much KKR planned to invest, but said the proposal would lead to a \"material impairment\" for some creditors, meaning a write-off of some of the debt and interest Thames Water owes.",
      "Thames added there was no certainty that a binding proposal would emerge, and it would require regulatory approval.",
      "\"The company remains focused on putting Thames Water on a more stable financial foundation, implementing its turnaround plan and delivering a market-led solution that is in the best interests of customers, UK taxpayers and the wider economy,\" it said.",
      "When Thames was privatised in 1989, it had no debt. But over the years it borrowed heavily and now has debts of about \u00a319bn.",
      "Its debt pile increased sharply when it was owned by Macquarie, an Australian infrastructure bank.",
      "Macquarie has said that it invested billions of pounds in upgrading Thames's water and sewerage infrastructure while it owned the company.",
      "But critics argue that it took billions of pounds out of the company in loans and dividends.",
      "Along with many UK water firms, Thames Water has been in the spotlight for pumping sewage into rivers.",
      "Between 2020 and the end of last year, it discharged at least 72 billion litres of sewage into the Thames.",

      "Trump's comments came as he prepares to unveil a massive slate of import taxes on Wednesday, in what he has called America's \"Liberation Day\".",
      "These will come on top of Trump's recent import taxes on aluminium, steel and cars, along with increased levies on all goods from China.",
      "The tougher stance from Trump has increased nervousness about a trade war hitting the global economy.",
      "Trump has offered conflicting signals about the scope of the expected tariffs, which have helped drive steep declines in the US stock market over the last month.",
      "Last week, he had raised the possibility that many countries could receive \"breaks\". But over the weekend, he appeared to be leaning toward a more wide-ranging plan.",
      "\"You'd start with all countries,\" Trump told reporters on Air Force One on Sunday. \"Essentially all of the countries that we're talking about.\"",
      "The UK has said it expects to be affected by US tariffs and is not ruling out retaliating.",
      "The prime minister's official spokesman has said talks on an economic deal between the two countries have been \"constructive\", but are likely to last beyond Wednesday.",
      "Other jurisdictions, such as the European Union and Canada, have already said that they are preparing a range of retaliatory trade measures.",
      "Concerns about the impact of the measures have unsettled markets and reignited fears of a recession in the US.",
      "What are tariffs and why is Trump using them?",

      "Shanti Kelemen, chief investment officer at M&G Wealth, told the BBC there could be \"quite a lot of uncertainty\" for a while given that previous tariff announcements have seen a lot of changes subsequently.",
      "Japan, which is a big player in exports, is among those countries most at risk from the changes, Ms Keleman said.",
      "\"They have a lot of automakers and also a very big presence in the semiconductor market, something that hasn't really been targeted yet but that could change,\" she noted.",
      "3 million US jobs?",
      "Trump sees tariffs - which are taxes imports - as a bargaining chip to get better trade terms, while also raising money and protecting the American economy from unfair competition.",
      "A White House fact sheet published last week also suggested that a 10% tariff on every import could create nearly three million US jobs.",
      "Trump trade adviser Peter Navarro has estimated that all the planned tariffs could raise $600bn annually, about a fifth of the value of total goods imports into the US.",
      "Many firms have said they expect the cost of the new tax to be passed onto customers in the form of higher prices.",
      "But that could lead to lower sales and fuel inflation in the US, a problem Trump had pledged on the campaign to tackle.",
      "Conversely, if companies decide to absorb the cost, it will hit their profits.",
      "'Counter-productive'",
      "Will Butler-Adams is chief executive of Brompton Bicycle, which makes folding bikes and relies on the US for about 10% of its sales.",
      "Brompton's products are not facing additional taxes yet.",
      "But Mr Butler-Adams said tariffs would make his bikes less competitive and force him to re-think his presence in the US.",
      "\"We won't continue to invest in the same way that we are now,\" he said. \"We may even shrink; in the extreme, we might pull out.\"",
      "Mr Butler-Adams said it had been hard to figure out the impact of tariffs that have already gone into effect, which require detailed accounting of how much steel in each item comes from outside the US.",
      "\"The reality is we don't [know] actually and the people who are on the borders importing goods into the US don't actually entirely understand how some of these tariffs might be put in,\" Mr Butler-Adams said.",
      "TikTok sale",
      "Separately, Trump said a deal with TikTok's Chinese owner ByteDance to sell the  app would be agreed before a deadline on Saturday.",

      "But try looking for American-made jelly in Europe, and you're likely to come up short.",
      "The US exports less than $300,000 (\u00a3231,000) in jam each year to the bloc.",
      "It's an imbalance that US company JM Smucker, one of the biggest sellers of such products in the US, blames on a 24%-plus import tax its fruit spreads face in the EU.",
      "\"The miniscule value of US exports to the European Union is entirely attributable to the high EU tariff,\" the company wrote in a letter to the White House this month, asking the Trump administration to address the issue as it prepares to levy \"reciprocal\" tariffs on America's biggest trading partners.",
      "\"Reciprocal US tariffs on EU jams and jellies would serve to level the playing field,\" the company said, noting that the highest US jam tariff is currently just 4.5%.",
      "Globally, Trump's push to deploy tariffs against close trading partners - many of which have average tariff levels similar to America's - has generated anger and bafflement, while drawing warnings from economists about higher prices and other potential economic pain.",
      "Some businesses in the US have echoed those concerns, but Trump's calls for tariffs are also channelling longstanding frustrations many firms have about foreign competition and policies they face abroad.",
      "Smucker's letter was one of hundreds submitted to the White House, seeking to influence the next set of tariffs, expected to be unveiled on 2 April.",
      "Apple farmers raised the big disparity in import duties their fruit faces in countries such as India (50%), Thailand (40%) and Brazil (10%), as well as sanitary rules in countries such as Australia they said unfairly block their exports.",
      "Streaming businesses flagged digital taxes in Canada and Turkey that they said \"unfairly target and discriminate\" against US companies.",
      "The oil and natural gas lobby criticised regulations in Mexico that require partnership with the state-owned oil company and other policies.",
      "The White House itself spotlighted uneven ethanol tariffs in Brazil (18%, compared with 2.5% in the US), car tariffs in Europe (10%, compared with 2.5% in the US) and motorcycles in India (until a few years ago, 100% vs 2.4% in the US).",
      "Trump has suggested that his plan for reciprocal tariffs will help remedy such grievances, pumping up his announcement as \"Liberation Day\".",
      "But even the businesses seeking action on their own issues have expressed hesitation about the president's tariff-first, ask-questions-later strategy, which risks retaliation and a wider trade war.",
      "With 2 April looming, there remains widespread uncertainty about the goals and scope of White House plans, especially as Trump launches more duties.",
      "\"We're going to be nice,\" he said this week, at the same time as he announced potentially devastating tariffs on foreign cars and car parts. \"I think people will be pleasantly surprised.\"",
      "What are tariffs and why is Trump using them?",
      "Is Trump right when he says the US faces unfair trade?",
      "India has already said it would lower its tariffs on motorcycles - an apparent bet that Trump's tariffs are a strategy designed to gain leverage for trade talks.",
      "But analysts warned that those hoping that Trump plans to use his reciprocal tariffs to negotiate changes elsewhere may be disappointed, as the president has also indicated he could be satisfied by simply hitting back.",
      "\"Some days it's about revenge and just equalising things, and other days it's about lowering tariffs and then other days, third days, it's about bringing manufacturing to the United States,\" said William Reinsch, senior adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington think tank.",
      "\"He's used them all at different times - there's not a single thread here that you can rely on.\"",
      "The mismatch between the blunt tool of tariffs and the more niche issues firms want the White House to champion has led to a delicate dance, as businesses suggest tariffs in their own interest, while also hoping to avoid the repercussions of the kind of sweeping duties that Trump has suggested might be on the table.",
      "For example, steel manufacturer NorthStar BlueScope Steel, which employs 700 people in the US melting steel from recycled metal, urged Trump to expand tariffs on steel and aluminium to parts.",
      "At the same time, however, it asked for an exemption for the raw materials it needs, such as scrap metal.",
      "Likewise, the lobby group for JM Smucker and other big food manufacturers, the Consumer Brands Association, warned against \"overly broad and sweeping tariffs\" that might end up making it more expensive for its members to import ingredients like cocoa, which are not made in the US.",
      "\"I don't necessarily want the current administration to say, well, we'll impose a tariff,\" Tom Madrecki, the group's vice president of supply chain resiliency, said at a recent forum about tariffs, hosted by Farmers for Free Trade.",
      "\"It's this careful balance between yes, I want you to take an America First trade policy and action to counter unfair trade policies abroad... but maybe not quite in that way.\"",
      "Wilbur Ross, who served as Trump's commerce secretary in his first term, said he thought business worries would dissipate as Trump's plans become clear, calling 2 April a \"big step\".",
      "But he noted that the president saw little downside to using tariffs, viewing them as either a source of new revenue, or a way to reduce imports and encourage more manufacturing.",
      "\"He's very committed,\" Ross said. \"People should have known that something like this was coming because he's been talking about it for many, many years.\"",
      "Republicans, traditionally the pro-trade party, have stayed supportive of Trump's strategy, even as tariff announcements have been blamed for the recent stock market sell-off and weakness in recent surveys of business and consumer confidence.",
      "At a recent hearing on trade, Representative Jodey Arrington, a Republican who represents Texas, acknowledged that there might be \"some pain associated on the front end\", but maintained Trump's focus on the issue would create opportunities for his constituents in the end.",
      "\"It just seems to me that it's un-American to not fight for our American manufacturers, producers and workers to simply have an even playing field,\" he said.",
      "\"We're simply attempting... to reset those relationships such that we're playing by the same set of rules,\" he added. \"Then everyone wins.\""

      "In 2022 and 2023 Gothenburg managed to avoid a financial penalty, but the newly released figures for 2024 show that it missed its target for switching to renewable energy. And so it is about to be fined 150,000 kroner.",

    "summary": "Skyfly's aircraft promises the flexibility of a helicopter without the cost, noise or emissions.",
    "story": [
      "Imagine an electric drone mixed with a fixed wing plane - that is the concept behind a new two-seater aircraft being developed by start-up company, Skyfly.",
      "The Axe promises the flexibility of a helicopter but without the cost, noise pollution or carbon emissions.",
      "It is a vertically capable aircraft, or Electric Vertical Take-off and Landing (eVTOL) aircraft, which means it can take off like a helicopter.",
      "It also has two fixed wings that allows it to take off and land from a runway.",
      "The company claims the Axe has a top speed of 100mph, it can carry up to 172kg - approximately the weight of two 13.5st adults - and has a range of 100 miles, about the distance from Oxford to the Isle of Wight.",
      "The team, based near Banbury in Oxfordshire, has taken five years to fine tune the design.",
      "\"Compared to a conventional aircraft it's got eight motors which is very strange,\" says Dr Bill Brooks, Skyfly's chief technical engineer.",
      "\"And it's a tail-first layout called a canard so it's got the tail at the front.  The all up weight is 750kg but 240kg of that are batteries so all the structure is carbon fibre to keep it as light as possible,\" Dr Brooks says.",
      "Safety is an important part of the design too.",
      "'Environmental benefits'",
      "The large wings help it to glide in the event of power failure and there are two motors at the end of each wing so that if one fails the other can compensate.",
      "It is also equipped with an emergency ballistic parachute to bring the aircraft and passengers down safely.",
      "As well as being safer and cleaner than conventional aircraft, Michael Thompson, Skyfly's chief executive, says electric models are significantly quieter too.",
      "\"When you're taking off, you're no longer annoying everyone around you from a noise perspective, so I do think electric propulsion brings not only environmental benefits but from a noise pollution point of view, it's a huge benefit as well,\" he says.",
      "Who is it marketed at?",
      "Other eVTOLs under development include those looking to provide an electric flying-taxi service like Bristol-based Vertical Aerospace (VA) .",
      "VA, as well as Archer and Joby in the US, are designing electric powered aircraft to carry up to four passengers.",
      "Skyfly's Axe, by comparison, is more compact and aimed at the private market.",
      "The do-it-youself kit-plane comes with a price tag of \u00a3250,000.",
      "It is aimed at existing pilots who want to transition away from diesel piston engines.",
      "Jason Pritchard, executive editor of eVTOL Insights, says it is also likely to appeal to flying clubs in order to train new members:",
      "\"The eVTOL aircraft industry is still in its infancy with initial operations a few years away, but it also needs to train large numbers of pilots in the coming years,\" he says.",
      "\"Additionally, the Axe's design can also train pilots with the skills and controls necessary to land an aircraft without power, which is a necessary tool.\"",
      "What about charging infrastructure?",
      "While the Axe can be charged up overnight with a conventional three-pin plug, just like EV cars, electric aircraft will need the charging infrastructure to be scaled up.",
      "Aerovolt, based in West Sussex, has installed rapid chargers at seven UK airports with 40 more in the pipeline.",
      "Its founder, Philip Kingsley-Dobson, says demand is growing.",
      "\"A lot of piston aircraft can't use leaded fuel in the future so they're looking for alternatives and ways we can decarbonise the lower end of aviation,\" he says.",
      "'Cutting edge'",
      "There are no eVTOL aircraft currently permitted to fly in the UK.",
      "Skyfly's Axe has successfully completed manned test flights in both hover and forward flight modes but still needs to be certified by the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA).",
      "With 40 pre-orders from buyers all over the world, the company hopes to deliver the new model to customers early next year.",
      "A CAA spokesperson said: \"We are working with innovators to test and fly brand new forms of aviation that keeps the UK at the cutting edge of flight technology and supports the sector to grow.",

      "At another, an elderly couple chat over a hot meal, while a queue of customers steadily forms at the till.",
      "But this is one of 52 cafes set to close - including others in London, Leeds, Portsmouth and Glasgow - announced this week in a cost-cutting drive that the supermarket chain says is designed to \"renew and reinvigorate Morrisons\" and focus \"investment into the areas that customers really value\".",
      "That came two months after Sainsbury's said it was closing all 61 of its supermarket cafes.",
      "While some see the decline of supermarket cafes as inevitable, shoppers around the country have told BBC News that these cafes give them a cheap, convenient and welcoming place to get a warm meal while catching up with friends.",
      "'Share a meal without the stress of cooking'",
      "Regulars at the Morrisons cafe in Queensbury say they're surprised - and saddened - to hear it's closing.",
      "Philomena Hughes, 76, is having a meal with two friends, having just been shopping. The trio have bumped into a couple they know at the cafe, who move over to the table next to them and join in their conversation.",
      "Philomena says she's \"furious\" about the closure. \"Morrisons was really the only place I would come,\" she says. \"We meet people we know in here.\"",
      "Other regulars at the cafe tell the BBC that the quality is good, prices are low, and it's convenient to grab groceries beforehand. They point to offers such as a free kids meal with an adult's one, free parking, and fish and chips with mushy peas for \u00a38.50.",
      "Morrisons says 344 of its cafes will remain open despite the planned closures but, according to its chief executive Rami Baiti\u00e9h, \"a minority have specific local challenges and in those locations, regrettably, closure and re-allocation of the space is the only sensible option\".",
      "Elsewhere in the country, Ben Hopkins, 32, feels his local Morrisons cafe in Meltham, West Yorkshire, is bustling every time he goes because \"the food is typical of that you'd get in a traditional greasy spoon\".",
      "Such outlets can come in handy for parents, too. Lisa Clavering, from St Albans, says she relied on Asda and Morrisons cafes for a \"quick and cheap hot lunch\" when her two sons were younger.",
      "\"As they grew, it was somewhere we could go together and share a meal without the stress of cooking it and cleaning up, where I didn't feel judged by other customers if they made a noise,\" the 42-year-old says.",
      "Lisa says part of the appeal of supermarket cafes is that they feel accessible - a \"warm and welcoming place with no fuss and no surprises\".",
      "\"I do worry that once they go, there's not really a like-for-like to replace them, and other alternatives are typically much more expensive,\" Lisa says.",
      "'Should come as no surprise'",
      "But other people question the need for supermarket cafes, pointing to changes in people's shopping habits and the growing competition from high-street coffee chains.",
      "The closure of Morrisons cafes \"should come as no surprise,\" retail analyst Natalie Berg tells the BBC.",
      "\"The grocers are desperately trying to navigate significant cost headwinds, while simultaneously competing with discounters like Aldi and Lidl.",
      "\"This is a low-margin industry, so supermarkets need to be utterly ruthless when it comes to cost-cutting.\"",
      "When shoppers come into larger supermarkets, they \"want low prices and they want a frictionless experience. In-store cafes work in certain locations, but they're simply not essential for most stores,\" Ms Berg says.",
      "It largely echoes the reasoning Sainsbury's has given for its closures - that \"the majority of [its] most loyal shoppers do not use the cafes regularly\".",

      "\"If it was popular, you'd hear about it,\" like when Pret A Manger changed its subscription service, he says.",
      "And besides, rival supermarket chains Tesco and Marks & Spencer - which have more than 300 cafes each - haven't said anything about closing their cafes.",

      "No? Well that is hardly surprising because unlike Ford they all went bust very early on. And they are just some of the failed car companies starting with the letter \"A\".",
      "We only remember the winners who went on to dominate the world's motor industry, and the current high-tech sector is much the same.",
      "A great many investors backed the wrong horseless carriages around a century ago and lost their money. Only a few picked Ford or Chrysler, which is almost exactly what is happening now, only to the tech sector.",

      "US tech firms feel pinch from China tariffs",
      "A principle reason for this tech sector volatility, according to Elroy Dimson, professor of finance at the University of Cambridge, is that like the once nascent car industry we don't know which tech firms will win in the long run.",
      "\"If you go back to the beginning of the last century there were an awful lot of motor companies, and it was clear that automobiles were going to make a huge difference,\" says Prof Dimson. \"But almost every company went bankrupt, you didn't know which company you should be buying.\"",
      "Then, of course, not all high-tech businesses are making money. The measure of the return on an investment in shares uses two factors, the growth in profits or dividends, and the growth in the value of the shares.",
      "Boring companies might pay reliable dividends and see their shares gradually increase in value. But many high-tech companies are not paying out much if anything in dividends. Instead, they are investing in future growth, and so their share prices fluctuate based on hopes of future profits.",
      "As Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at UK financial services firm Hargreaves Lansdown, puts it: \"Tech shares are more volatile, they have high valuations and their price-earnings ratios are very high, and growth stocks are more sensitive to interest rate movements.\"",
      "But also, investors in such shares are, as Ms Streeter puts it, gambling on \"not jam today but jam tomorrow\". They are all trying to pick the next future big winner, not the one paying out profits now, but the one that will eventually pay huge dividends sometime in the future.",
      "So, any news or even suggestion that future growth is not going to be as good as previously expected means share values can collapse.",
      "On the other hand, any good news boosts share prices even if current profits, or even losses, don't change at all, as investors pile into what they think is the future winner. The shares are more volatile because they are not underwritten by current profits or dividends.",
      "That means as Prof Dimson puts it, \"that small changes in growth expectation can lead to large changes in share value\", which can effect a large number of companies at the same time.",
      "\"You have companies that are reasonably similar, so when growth rates change it is effecting quite a few companies in a similar way,\" he says.",
      "\"This is not different from the dotcom boom at the beginning of the 2000s. There were companies with huge growth prospects. And when the growth prospects disappeared, these were the companies that disappeared.\"",
      "Also, even today there are not that many really large high-tech companies. In America they are colloquially known as the \"magnificent seven\" - Nvidia, a chipmaker, Alphabet, which owns Google, Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, Meta, the parent of Facebook, and Tesla.",
      "So, it does not take much to spook the market, especially since several of these firms are really quite young, and are dominant in sectors where previous leaders have crashed and burned. Anyone remember Ericsson, Boo or Compaq?",
      "Technology, unlike say steel production or food manufacturing, is changing at a very rapid rate, and there is obviously the chance that a new high-tech company will come along and destroy the business model of its most established rivals.",
      "There is simply no guarantee that today's \"magnificent seven\" will remain magnificent or even stay as the same seven firms.",
      "Take Tesla for example, its sales have recently fallen in response to two widely-reported factors. Firstly, some potential customers are opposed to Tesla owner Elon Musk's involvement in President Trump's government. And secondly, Chinese electric car firms such as BYD are increasingly strong competitors.",
      "Meanwhile, Nvidia saw its share price drop sharply at the start of this year following the release of Chinese artificial intelligence chatbot DeepSeek.  This app was reportedly created at a fraction of the cost of its rivals.",
      "The instant popularity of DeepSeek has raised questions about the future of America's AI dominance and the scale of investments US firms are planning. This concerns Nvidia because it is at the forefront of making microchips for AI processing.",
      "AI is now the biggest tech game in town, and it seems that absolutely everyone is claiming that AI is transforming their industry, their products and their profits. They can't all be right.",
      "Or as Prof Dimon puts it: \"At least in 1910 you knew what automobiles did, but today with AI companies you have to rely on the wisdom of the crowd, and for AI companies that isn't good enough.\"",
      "And not all AI firms can win, adds Robert Whaley, professor of finance at Vanderbilt University in Tennessee. \"AI is certainly contributing to tech volatility. The race is on.\"",
      "That means that AI shares are sensitive to predictions. And any sign that a particular firm is lagging in the AI race may mean that lots of investors, most of whom don't understand the subject, abandon it for another that seems to be further ahead.",
      "Then there are investors who seemingly don't seem to care which companies' shares they buy, so long as they are in the \"booming\" high-tech sector, as they are speculating and spreading their risks.",
      "In short, share prices are not always a rational measure of a firm's value, especially in the high-tech sector, or even of its prospects. Instead, they can represent the optimism of investors. And optimism does not always last.",
      "It is often short-lived, passing, and faddish. And sometimes optimism comes face to face with reality or just plain fades away. It is, in short, volatile.",

      "A range of household bills, including council tax, water, gas and electricity have risen today.",
      "The BBC's cost of living correspondent, Kevin Peachey, has been answering your most asked questions on the price rises.",
      "Why are bills going up?",
      "Tashi and Chris asked why bills are going up.",
      "This is a very simple question, but I'm afraid the answer isn't straightforward. There are a host of reasons why bills are rising.",
      "On energy, it's the consequence of an increase in wholesale prices paid by suppliers, often owing to global events.",
      "Councils and water companies, meanwhile, say there's a desperate need to raise bills to pay for investment in services.",
      "Some bill increases are always scheduled for this time of year, to match the rate of rising prices - inflation.",
      "So another question is: what can you do about it?",
      "Consumer groups are urging people to shop around, claim everything they are entitled to, and cut back where possible.",
      "We have a guide to help you here.",
      "Is cash a better way to budget?",
      "James: I get \u00a3150 in cash out every week. It's amazing how it helps you budget things. Why don't more people try it?",
      "There is evidence of people turning to notes and coins to help them budget.",
      "Although cash use was hit during the pandemic, it has made a bit of a comeback, with many people taking the same view as James.",
      "However, there are areas in which this doesn't work.",
      "Shopping around for a better deal on essential bills is often something done online, and may require signing up to a direct debit payment. Rewards, or money off, are often also available to those who pay by card.",
      "So, it may well be that using a mix of ways to pay works best - but questions remain about access to cash and internet services among the vulnerable.",
      "Will my wage rise be eaten away by tax?",
      "Richard Kendall asked about frozen tax thresholds, which mean pay rises can see people drawn into paying higher rates of income tax.",
      "This is what is known as fiscal drag - not a phrase you'll hear talked about much, but it is important.",
      "It means that while income tax rates haven't risen, the income levels at which they are paid have been frozen, and will continue to be so until 2028.",
      "There have been rumours that the freeze could be extended, but there are no concrete plans for that as yet.",
      "So, more people are being dragged into paying higher rates of tax, or simply having a greater proportion of their income taxed.",
      "Taking a closer look at your pay slip is worthwhile, and it needs to be considered when looking at your personal budget. Experts say studying exactly how much post-tax income is coming in, and looking at it alongside your spending, is never a waste of time.",
      "And it may require you to trim some of your spending. Shopping around, or cancelling unused subscriptions are a good start, experts say.",
      "Do we just have to accept water bill increases?",
      "Colin Smith: Do we simply have to accept water bill increases because we can't shop around?",
      "Water services are different, because the 'switch for a better deal' advice simply doesn't, ahem, hold water.",
      "There is plenty of debate over why water bills are going up so much (remember some suppliers wanted bigger increases).",
      "But there are things you can do to keep your costs down, even though you can't shop around.",
      "Experts say getting a water meter fitted can reduce bills if you have relatively low usage. Water-saving shower heads, or similar, are available free from some companies.",
      "Then, there is the WaterSure scheme, which means the bill is capped for people on certain benefits, who have a medical condition, or who have a certain number of school-age children at home. You do need to apply for this help though.",
      "Does this hit the government's plans for growth?",
      "Sam Halkyard, 32, from Rotherham: How does the government expect the economy to grow with all these bill increases?",
      "Ministers are pushing their \"agenda for growth\" at every opportunity, calling for red tape to be cut to pave the way for investment.",
      "There is a delicate balancing act here. The government wants people's living standards to rise, and it wants them to spend to encourage investment by businesses.",
      "Remember, all of this comes with a background of wage rises outpacing prices, an uptick in the housing market, and some signs of hope for the wider economy.",
      "But ministers won't want to see a return of runaway inflation - the annual rise of prices - because that would inevitably lead to a rise in interest rates, and higher borrowing costs for businesses and individuals.",
      "So, outside of this, you are seeing the government push ahead with some big, long-term investment projects, like road tunnels and runways.",
      "I'm single, where's help for me?",
      "Jules, 57: I'm single. My wages don't go up in April. Where's the help for us?",
      "Charities have raised the alarm specifically about people like you, Jules.",
      "Citizens Advice says that single households, including single parents, tend to spend a greater proportion of their income on household bills.",
      "As a result, there is far less wriggle room financially when bills rise.",
      "One solution is to investigate all the options that are open to you. For example, as I'm sure you already know if it includes you, there is a 25% discount on council tax, for those who live on their own.",

      "Standing charges are the fees charged to all billpayers to cover the cost of being connected to a gas and electricity supply. They are unaffected by the amount of energy that a household uses.",
      "After rising sharply in recent years, the average electricity standing charge actually fell from today - although it rose slightly for gas. More significantly, it varies considerably depending on where you live.",
      "The energy regulator, Ofgem, is considering reform that would allow people a choice of ways to pay - but stresses that these costs will still need to be covered.",

      "Ian may be stretching his point a little - local authorities provide a range of services such as street lighting, parks and care services.",
      "However, at its heart, his question highlights a common debate.",
      "Should these bill increases stay at the bare minimum because people are struggling financially, or are our local services in such desperate need of investment that council tax needs to go up above inflation?",
      "Are pensioners facing a harder hit?",
      "Lyn Nailer: Will pensioners suffer the most from these bill rises?",
      "One important point to stress here is that different people, in different areas of the country, will be affected in different ways.",
      "Water and energy bills vary depending on where you live, and the different nations of the UK have different rules on council tax and more.",
      "But the state pension is UK-wide, and the good news is that it will be going up by more than the rate of price rises from next week. The triple lock means it will increase by 4.1%.",
      "Does everyone get the full state pension? No.",
      "Does the increase mean pensioners' finances won't be stretched? Of course not.",
      "But when asked about how people will cope, ministers are inevitably pointing to this increase as evidence of how the government is helping out.",
      "What about the minimum wage increase?",
      "David and Steve pointed out that incomes are rising, including via an increase of the minimum wage.",
      "Yes, it is not all doom and gloom today.",
      "There is an increase in the minimum wage - up to \u00a312.21 an hour for over 21s - and there are increases too for younger workers and apprentices.",
      "Official figures show that average wages have been rising faster than prices. The state pension and benefits will also go up from next week.",
      "This will certainly help pay some of those bills, and you won't see the impact directly until you look at your bank balance in the coming weeks.",
      "The Treasury is also pointing to moves to freeze fuel duty and ensure the main rates of tax - income tax, VAT and employees' National Insurance - do not go up during this Parliament, as evidence of the support billpayers are receiving.",
      "Is there a silver lining?",
      "Bills may be rising - but for some people, incomes are going up too.",
      "Benefits and the state pension are going up in a week's time. Wages have also been rising at a faster pace than the rate of inflation, and the start of April also brings an increase in the minimum wage. It means:",

    "published": "Fri, 28 Mar 2025 00:00:13 GMT",
    "summary": "Why the reign of the free market is facing its biggest ever challenge",
    "story": [
      "I remember 1974 well. With inflation on the rise, the government had been locked in battle with trade unions over worker pay. The government appeared paralysed: stand up to the miners and strikes could shut down the power system, but give in and pay them more money and inflation would rocket.",
      "And then the global oil crisis came out of nowhere. It threw economies, including Britain's, into chaos. The government introduced a three-day week. Power cuts were common - we would be plunged into darkness without warning. And seemingly, the government just expected us to deal with it.",
      "This was also the year I began presenting the BBC's current affairs programme Panorama. We spent a lot of time debating these issues. People came on with all kinds of different ideas of what to do.",
      "There were even suggestions that what the country really needed to take back control from the unions was a military takeover - a coup.",
      "There was another idea out there too. It was proposed by the Conservative politician Keith Joseph and was entirely radical - so removed from the mainstream, in fact, that during filming of Panorama, Joseph turned to the production team and asked exasperatedly if they understood what he meant.",
      "That idea was the free market.",
      "This meant Britain departing from the post World War Two consensus that government should control the economy and that instead if you left the markets alone, they would deliver the country greater prosperity and security.",
      "If, in 2025, the idea sounds anything but radical, that's exactly the point.",
      "What we saw in the UK in the 1980s under Margaret Thatcher's government was just how quickly the free market transitioned from a radical idea into the new reality. Then before long it became what many assumed was the system that would last forever.",
      "US President Donald Trump is a billionaire businessman who has clearly done well financially out of capitalism. But suddenly, thanks in part to him, the free market system finds itself under assault like never before.",
      "It might yet weather the storm. However others are asking, is the free market system fatally flawed and doomed to failure?",
      "The fantasy world of Thatcher's Britain",
      "So much of what Thatcher did in the wake of her 1983 general election victory seems so obvious now. We take it for granted that private companies play a pivotal role in providing our water, electricity, gas, railways, ports and freight.",
      "But at the time few believed it possible to do what she had done - it seemed like a fantasy world, completely detached from how things had been done post war.",
      "I was six when the war ended. There was rationing \u2013 coupons that allowed you to buy meat or clothes, or of course, sweets. But out of these hard times and on the heels of victory, a new vision of society was emerging in Britain.",
      "With Clement Attlee's landslide election victory in July 1945, for the first time in Britain's political history a majority cast their votes for a party ostensibly dedicated to socialism.",
      "But more than that, a new consensus on how the country should run emerged, with those leading the Labour and Conservative parties singing from a broadly similar sheet.",
      "\"We have built our defences against want and sickness, and we're proud of it,\" was uttered not by a Labour prime minister but by Harold Macmillan, Conservative prime minister from 1957 to 1963. This had been how things were done.",
      "However not everyone bought into the consensus. Antony Fisher, who was a chicken farmer, was exasperated by what he saw as the meddling of the Egg Marketing Board. He set up the Institute of Economic Affairs think tank, inspired Keith Joseph and he in turn got Thatcher's ear.",
      "Trump's admiration of Thatcher",
      "That the current assault on the free market is coming, in part, from a Republican US president seems all the more ironic given how popular Thatcher's reforms were with the American right.",
      "Thatcher and President Ronald Reagan shared a similar world view, and Trump has spoken of his admiration for the two, albeit with the caveat that he didn't agree with some of Reagan's trade policies.",
      "Thatcher was convinced that the country would be much better off if gas and water and electricity were taken out of the hands of the state. And sold on the open market. The free market. Just like buying a loaf of bread.",
      "The Thatcher government's big idea was that they weren't just going to sell the shares in state-owned utilities to big businesses or investors. They were going to offer them to the British people.",
      "In December 1984 shares in British Telecom (BT) went on sale. The next morning, the numbers were staggering: more than two million Britons were now BT shareholders.",
      "And Thatcher began to realise that selling off these companies wasn't just about breaking the shackles of government control. It could be something bigger - turning every person in Britain into a capitalist and in doing so making capitalism popular.",
      "In Britain, by the end of the 1980s, the scale of transformation was staggering. The sum of \u00a360bn was raised by selling off state run companies. Up to 15 million Britons were now shareholders.",
      "Britain was embracing the free market. This wasn't just an economic shift. It was a cultural revolution. A redefinition of Britain's relationship with money, with government, and with itself.",
      "And if Thatcher's privatisation had given ordinary people the chance to buy shares, her reforms to Britain's financial services sector in 1986, known as the Big Bang, gave ordinary people the chance to sell them too, to get a job in the previously closed world of the City.",
      "There were many on the left for whom the principle alone of these reforms was something to object to. The assault on the free market from some on the right is not about the principles of the reforms, but the consequences.",
      "Offshore business and collapsing communities",
      "At the core of Thatcher's thinking was a belief that free market capitalism could work only if many people had a direct stake in it. And with share ownership of previously state run utilities, many people did. But before long, alarm bells were starting to be rung. And their chime has only gotten louder.",
      "James Goldsmith was a businessman who had made a fortune by buying struggling companies cheaply, reshaping them to maximise efficiency and then selling them at a profit. The 1980s reforms were like manna from heaven for him.",
      "But then he seemed to change his mind about things. In 1994 he told a committee of US senators that its premise contained a fatal flaw - that the system demanded maximum profit but to achieve maximum profit that meant severing the umbilical link with many of your own electorate.",
      "\"You get to a system whereby, to get the best corporate profits, you have to leave your own country. You have to say to your own sales force 'Goodbye, we can't use you anymore - you're too expensive'.",
      "\"You've got unions. You want holidays. You want protection. So we're going offshore.\"",
      "Goldsmith was predicting that companies would take their business wherever they would make the most money. If you are a CEO answerable to shareholders that's literally your job description. And the result, he said, would be job losses in the West, with communities collapsing.",
      "And to make things worse, he argued that Britain had ceded sovereignty to the likes of the European Union and the World Trade Organization, with Britain binding itself to an economic system run by unelected bureaucrats in Brussels, only adding to the sense of alienation felt in collapsing communities. And with global markets dictating policy. If an industry wasn't profitable, it was left to die.",
      "Today, the UK may be a global leader in science and financial services but is that of much consolation to communities where we once made things that are now made offshore?",
      "Based on what I often heard in my many years touring the country presenting Question Time, I'm not sure it is.",
      "Goldsmith would end up trying to go into politics. His Referendum Party was trounced in the 1997 general election but he had planted a seed. He had argued that the global free market path that Britain and the rest of the world was going down was dangerous. That it would spread division around the world.",
      "Fast-forward nearly 20 years to 2016 and his warning came to pass. Britain voted to leave the European Union and the verdict could not be clearer: the Leave vote was highest in those left-behind communities, seemingly fuelled by those who felt globalisation was not working for them.",
      "The dream of a nation of shareholders has soured too.",
      "In 1989 Thames Water was privatised. We were promised lower bills, better infrastructure, less red tape and investment in a system fraying at the edges. It was investment that the global capitalist system was supposedly best placed to provide.",
      "What followed was something else entirely. Debt ballooned and dividends flowed to shareholders. The company extracted profit while pipes leaked and sewage poured into rivers. And our bills now pay for interest on that debt - it feels like we've come a long way from Thatcher's nation of shareholders.",
      "Trump's tariffs 'defy easy explanation'",
      "Back in 1994, James Goldsmith had posited that the problem with the free market dream was that it didn't protect the home base.",
      "Now, there is someone else much more powerful who takes that view.",
      "President Trump's methods are so erratic that with him it's hard to tell what is going on. His readiness to slap hugely consequential tariffs on countries that are both traditional foes and supposed friends at times defies easy explanation.",
      "But what we can say is that he is trying to return to ideas that preceded the free market. He is trying to make America strong through protectionism, making it harder for anyone to simply sell anywhere.",
      "There is an argument that if you take the long view then perhaps the free market period is the outlier. Britain itself had a long, long period of protectionism before it embraced free trade.",
      "Tariffs are nothing new in world economic history and in a sense Trump is just trying to return the US to how things were, albeit in quite a chaotic way.",
      "The reign of the free market is facing its biggest ever challenge. But that challenge is coming not from supporters of socialism who ideologically back a big role for the state. Instead, the challenge is coming from Trump, a man who is broadly speaking of the right and has no qualms with capitalism allowing people to become very rich.",
      "That the challenge is coming from within is what makes it so potent.",

    "story": [
      "This controversial fringe group, determined for the world to have more babies, claims that some of the most powerful people in the US government are sympathetic to their cause. But how much influence do they really have?",
      "Listen to Stephanie read this article",
      "Simone Collins is sitting in her 18th century cottage in Pennsylvania, dressed in a black pilgrim pinafore with a wide collar, bouncing one of her four children on her lap. It is 8.30am and she looks a little tired \u2013 she runs several businesses, a foundation and is currently pregnant with her fifth child, though she and her husband Malcolm plan to have more.",
      "\"At least seven,\" she declares, \"and as many as I can physically carry - 12 would be even more brilliant.\"",
      "The US couple, aged 37 and 38, ardently believe that the world needs to have more babies or risk civilisational collapse. They have become the poster children for pronatalism, a movement that believes falling birth rates are a big problem for society. And that big families are the answer.",
      "For the last five years, they have spread the word about their goal by opening up their home for interviews and photoshoots. They claim to have used special technology, during the IVF process, to screen their embryos for traits such as intelligence.",
      "\"The studies let us know what our genetic predilection for IQ is,\" they told an undercover reporter in 2023. \"We will never choose a child who is less privileged in IQ than either of us.\"",
      "Speaking today, however, Malcolm admits, \"The easiest way to [spread the word about pronatalism] was to turn ourselves into a meme... If we take a reasonable approach to things and say things are nuanced, nobody engages. And then we go and say something outrageous and offensive and everyone's into it.\"",
      "But since Donald Trump was sworn in as US President for the second time earlier this year, they have taken their evangelising to a new level. The Collinses now see certain people in the White House as potential allies - and they fully intend to capitalise on that.",
      "Elon Musk, who is said to have fathered 14 children, has called fertility decline \"the biggest danger civilisation faces, by far\". He has donated $10m (\u00a37.75m) to the Population Wellbeing Initiative in Texas, which conducts research into fertility, parenting, and the future of population growth.",
      "The US Vice President JD Vance has also spoken openly about his views on procreation. At an anti-abortion rally in January he declared: \"I want more babies in the United States of America.\"",
      "There are early indications that the Trump administration is prioritising family too. On 18 February, Trump signed an executive order to improve access for IVF that recognised \"the importance of family formation and that our nation's public policy must make it easier for loving and longing mothers and fathers to have children\".",
      "Pronatalists are buoyed by this and many hope it is a sign of things to come.",
      "The facts of fertility decline are clear. The US is at a record low of 1.62 children per woman, and by the end of the century the UN projects a majority of countries will have a shrinking population. That will have a profound effect on society and our economies. Some people believe we can adapt over time to this new reality, but pronatalists are less sanguine.",
      "But there is a political element to the movement too. Pronatalists are almost exclusively from the political right. Malcolm and Simone Collins, for example, describe themselves as former liberals who became disillusioned with progressive, \"woke\" politics.",
      "They see themselves as pragmatic and profoundly anti-bureaucratic.",
      "\"We are a coalition of people who are incredibly different in our philosophies, our theological beliefs, our family structures,\" says Malcolm. \"But the one thing we agree on is that our core enemy is the urban monoculture; the leftist unifying culture.\"",
      "So, could this fringe group really gain the ear of some of the most powerful people in the US government? And if so, just how much soft power could they have to influence policy not only around population decline but about wider issues too?",
      "Vance, Musk and the 'Fertilisation President'",
      "Last weekend, a group of roughly 200 pronatalists congregated in Texas for the second Natal Conference, an annual weekend-long event that cost around $1,000 (\u00a3775) to attend.",
      "The conference brings together two strands in pronatalism that come from very different branches of the American right: both conservative Christians and members of the so-called 'tech right,' an ascendant wing that came out of the libertarian, start-up culture of Silicon Valley.",
      "Some are connected to the current US government. Michael Anton was appointed by Trump as the Director of Policy Planning at the State Department. He spoke at last year's conference.",
      "Other speakers at this year's conference included Carl Benjamin, who has links to far-right activist Tommy Robinson, and Charles Cornish-Dale, an influencer who goes by the name Raw Egg Nationalist.",
      "\"It's like an unholy alliance,\" says Catherine Pakaluk, an economist, mother of eight and stepmother of six. She too spoke at the conference but is reluctant to call herself a pronatalist. \"It's a complicated movement and includes people with very different positions,\" she says.",
      "One thing they have in common, however, is that they all want their message to be heard at the highest levels of government.",
      "Some believe they already are being heard. \"[If you ask me] do we have pronatalists in the White House right now who are pushing policy,\" says Malcolm, \"my response to this would be, 'I mean, duh, like Elon and JD Vance'.\"",
      "In President Trump's executive orders to date, there has been little apart from the order on IVF that could be seen as directly pro-family. But pronatalist thinking may be starting to influence policy that is less explicitly about fertility.",
      "In January, the US transportation secretary Sean Duffy circulated a memo instructing his department to \"give preference to communities with marriage and birth rates higher than the national average\" when awarding grants.",
      "Roger Severino, Vice-President of Domestic Policy at right-wing think tank the Heritage Foundation, sees the influence of JD Vance in that policy. \"Vance comes at it from a long history of pro-family thinking and policymaking,\" he says.",
      "Vance has often spoken about the need to fix a \"broken culture\" that is tearing the US family apart, by undermining men.",
      "In a recent interview, he said: \"We actually think God made male and female for a purpose and we want you guys to thrive as young men and young women and we're going to help with our public policy to make it possible to do that.\"",
      "This idea has been echoed in pronatalist circles.",
      "\"Vance is a vocal pronatalist,\" says Rachel Cohen, policy correspondent at Vox. \"Trump himself campaigned on implementing a new \"baby boom\" and last week he declared himself the 'fertilisation president'.\"",
      "The pronatalists drafting DIY executive orders",
      "Malcolm says he has already made attempts to influence the White House. He claims to have engaged in \"backroom channelling of influential people, making sure that pronatalism became normal to talk about within the centres of power, and that ended up dripping its way up to administration and core tech culture\".",
      "They are in discussions on pronatalist policy with the Heritage Foundation. Then there is a rather more direct approach they claim to have taken. \"We have submitted draft executive orders to the Trump administration,\" says Simone.",
      "Their proposals include suggestions for how to remove layers of regulation from childcare providers and expanding car seat choice so cars can fit more children.",
      "The couple aren't sure if those are going to translate into anything concrete just yet \u2013 but they believe they have a receptive audience.",
      "Their connection to power is thanks to the so-called tech right, a reactionary movement against liberalism led by some of the most powerful people in Silicon Valley. Those in the tech right include Paypal co-founder Peter Thiel \u2013 who sponsored Vance's Senate race and has invested in fertility technology \u2013 and venture capitalists David Sacks and Marc Andreessen.",
      "Simone Collins was formerly the managing director of an exclusive members' club run by Mr Thiel, and the couple say they ran two other invite-only networking groups for business elites. Their Pronatalist Foundation, founded in 2021, received just under $500,000 (\u00a3387,000) through a fund of the Skype co-founder, Estonian billionaire Jann Tallinn.",
      "\"The tech right bring a lot of energy to the discussion,\" says Roger Severino, Vice-President of Domestic Policy at the Heritage Foundation. \"We've been discussing how we could blend these various strains on the right. We're trying to cohere the movement.\"",
      "Cracks in the pronatalist alliance",
      "There are, however, cracks in the alliance which add to the challenge of trying to make the movement \u201ccoherent\u201d.",
      "Many on the traditional religious right have misgivings about the use of IVF and disagree with embryo screening, while some also oppose gay marriage and parenthood.",
      "\"It's just an odd alliance of people who seem to agree on this one point: that the birth rate is too low. But there are wildly different prescriptions and ideas about what might be done to fix it,\" says Ms Pakaluk.",
      "\"There's a renewed interest in pronatalism and family promotion among American conservatives,\" says Timothy Carney, author of Family Unfriendly, How our Culture Made Raising Kids Much Harder than it Needs to Be. But he adds: \"There will definitely be tensions.\"",
      "One of those most divisive issues in pronatalism are the mention of certain aspects related to genetics among some of its tech right proponents. It's something that has prompted concern, in particular around the ethics of this, on all sides of the political spectrum.",
      "Patrick T Brown, a fellow at the right-leaning American Ethics and Public Policy Centre working on pro-family policy, suggests that the executive order to improve access to IVF could show the influence of the tech-right on policy. But he has his concerns about that influence, particularly around embryo screening. \"Turning children into consumer products is something that I really worry about,\" he says. \"That leads to a troublesome place.\"",
      "Some of those attending the recent conference describe themselves as \"race realists\", and one has published offensive views alleging a link between intelligence and race that, according to many scientists, are plain wrong.",
      "Geneticist Adam Rutherford describes the data used as \"fraudulent and racist, drawn from hopeless sample sizes that wouldn't constitute valid scientific evidence to anyone vaguely interested in truth.",
      "\"These assertions are recapitulations of historical ideas of scientific racism.\"",
      "The associations with extreme views in the movement is one of the reasons some people don't like to call themselves pronatalists. Catherine Pakaluk is one of them. \"I think there probably are some people who are just pure eugenicists or white supremacists,\" she says.",

      "The government's policy of adding VAT to private school fees will \"interfere with the fundamental right to education\", the High Court has heard.",
      "In front of a packed court room, with headteachers and students in school uniforms listening from the public gallery, Lord David Pannick KC, argued the policy is discriminatory.",
      "The legal challenge is being brought by families who say their needs \"cannot be adequately met in the state sector\" including those who have children with special educational needs and disabilities (SEND) and pupils at faith schools.",
      "Barristers for the government are expected to defend the policy on Wednesday by saying it would raise money and standards in the state sector.",
      "VAT on private school fees was introduced on 1 January across the UK.",
      "Lord Pannick, one of the country's leading barristers in cases relating to government decisions, said the families he is representing \"are not wealthy\".",
      "Two of the claimants have no alternative schools in their area to meet the needs of their children who have SEND, the court heard.",
      "Another family sent their child to a single sex independent primary school after they experienced \"harassment\" in their previous co-educational school.",
      "Lord Pannick argued that adding VAT to their fees impedes their right to access education and the policy is \"unprecedented\" in all other Council of Europe states.",
      "Around a quarter of families affected by the VAT changes fall below the average wealth level, and the policy has been brought in \"irrespective of the needs of the child\" or of the ability of the family to pay, he told the court.",
      "Lord Pannick is leading the challenge for the Independent Schools Council (ISC) which represents more than 1,400 private schools. There are two further claims also being heard by a group of faith schools and the parent-led group Education not Discrimination.",
      "They are seeking a declaration of incompatibility with Article 2 of the First Protocol of the European Convention on Human Rights, which is the right to education, and that the policy is also discriminatory.",
      "It is \"not good enough\" for the government to say \"it has been debated in Parliament\" and will \"raise revenue\", Lord Pannick argued, stating that the policy needed stricter scrutiny.",
      "Barristers representing Chancellor Rachel Reeves, along with HMRC and the Department for Education (DfE), are due to give their side of the case on Wednesday.",
      "In his written submission, Sir James Eadie KC, representing the government, said parents wishing to opt out of \"universally accessible state-funded education\" are free to choose \"any private education for their child that they can afford\", or they can \"educate their child at home\".",
      "Sir James will argue that taxes, minimum wage laws and national insurance, which all affect the cost of private school fees, do not interfere with \"with freedom to offer or receive private education.\"",
      "SEND pupils who have an education, health and care plan which names a private school have their fees paid for by their local council.",
      "Sophie Kemp from the law firm Kingsley Napley is representing the ISC families and told the BBC: \"It's particularly difficult for those who may have SEND and/or religious convictions where the state can't meet those needs.\"",
      "She added: \"For example children with very complex needs have had many failed placements, including in the state sector, and then that leaves them in a difficult position because their educational needs cannot necessarily be met by going to the state sector, and that's how the policy has a discriminatory impact on children with those types of needs.\"",
      "Speaking outside court, Caroline Santer, headteacher at the King's School in Hampshire, said she was hopeful the review would change things as they had a \"strong argument\".",
      "Ms Santer said the primary school, where fees start at \u00a37,258, charges less than it costs the government to put a child in state school \"saving the government a lot of money\".",
      "She added: \"Parents are already struggling with fairly reasonable fees \u2013 now 20% on top does seem an affront to human rights.\"",

      "For some payments, such as energy, water or broadband, there are things you could do to reduce the impact of price rises.",
      "Here are seven ways you could be affected by this week's increases.",
      "1. Water bills",
      "Water bills for households in England and Wales are going up by \u00a310 per month on average.",
      "However, there's a lot of variation depending on your supplier.",
      "For example, the annual Southern Water bill is jumping 47% to \u00a3703, while Anglian Water customers are paying 19% more, or \u00a3626.",
      "The increases are being front-loaded for the next five years, meaning the biggest rise is coming this year.",

      "Regulator Ofgem increased the energy price cap because of higher wholesale costs and inflation.",

      "Read more: Fixed-price deals are not affected by the energy price cap and offer certainty for a set period. But if energy prices drop when you are on the deal, you could be stuck at a higher price.",
      "3. Council tax",
      "It is likely the tax you pay to your local authority is going up.",
      "In England, local authorities with responsibility for delivering social care can increase council tax every year by up to 4.99% without triggering a referendum or local vote.",

      "The government has kept in place the freeze on tax thresholds on income tax and National Insurance until 2028, a policy brought in by the previous government.",
      "This is often dubbed a stealth tax because of a process called \"fiscal drag\", which sees more people \"dragged\" into paying higher rates of tax as wages rise.",

      "\"I think equipping students with the mindset of going out of Wales is not necessarily a bad thing because I think a lot of students will come back to invest their skillset back into Wales,\" he said.",

      "And perhaps his best performance combined his skills as a stage actor with a fine singing voice, to bring to life 1960s-counterculture icon Jim Morrison, in Oliver Stone's film The Doors.",
      "Critic Roger Ebert wrote: \"If there is an award for the most unsung leading man of his generation, Val Kilmer should get it.",
      "\"In movies as different as Real Genius, Top Gun, Top Secret!, he has shown a range of characters so convincing that it's likely most people, even now, don't realise they were looking at the same actor.\"",

      "Kilmer's ambition was to study at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (Rada), in London, but his application was rejected because, at 17, he was a year below the minimum entry age.",
      "Instead, Kilmer became the then youngest pupil to enrol at the Julliard School, in New York, one of the world's most prestigious drama conservatories.",
      "A gifted student, Kilmer co-wrote and made his stage debut in How It All Began, a play based on the life of a German radical, at the Public Theatre.",

      "But in the 1990s, he proved he could carry a major film as a lead actor.",
      "Director Stone had long wanted to make a biopic of The Doors, focusing on the band's singer, who had died of a drugs overdose in Paris in 1971.",
      "A number of actors were considered, including John Travolta and Richard Gere, before Stone chose Kilmer because of his physical resemblance to Morrison and strong singing voice.",
      "In his trademark single-minded approach, Kilmer lost weight and learned 50 Doors songs by heart, as well as spending time in a studio perfecting Morrison's stage style.",

      "Kilmer also played Elvis Presley in Tony Scott's True Romance, written by Quentin Tarantino, and sickly alcoholic gambler and dentist Doc Holliday in the 1993 film Tombstone - a retelling of the story of Wyatt Earp's gunfight at the OK Corral, which some critics called his finest performance.",
      "In 1995, Kilmer replaced Michael Keaton in the third of a trilogy of Batman films, Batman Forever.",

      "In the early 2000s, there was no shortage of film appearances - but Kilmer's cinema career had hit a plateau.",
      "In 2004, he returned to the theatre, in a musical production of The Ten Commandments, in Los Angeles.",

    "story": [
      "Paul Mescal and Barry Keoghan have been confirmed as part of the all-star line-up who will play members of the Beatles in four major new films about the band.",
      "Normal People and Gladiator II actor Mescal will portray Sir Paul McCartney, while Saltburn star Keoghan will step into Ringo Starr's shoes.",
      "The acting supergroup will also feature Harris Dickinson, who was most recently seen opposite Nicole Kidman in Babygirl, as John Lennon.",
      "And Joseph Quinn will go from Marvel's Fantastic Four to the Fab Four, playing George Harrison in the big-screen quadrilogy, which will be directed by Sir Sam Mendes.",
      "The Oscar-winning director was joined by the four actors for the announcement at the CinemaCon convention in Las Vegas on Monday.",
      "Each film will focus on a different member of the legendary group.",
      "\"Each one is told from the particular perspective of just one of the guys,\" Sir Sam told the event. \"They intersect in different ways - sometimes overlapping, sometimes not.",
      "\"They're four very different human beings. Perhaps this is a chance to understand them a little more deeply. But together, all four films will tell the story of the greatest band in history.\"",
      "The films will be released \"in proximity\" to each other in April 2028.",
      "The director explained: \"I just felt the story of the band was too huge to fit into a single movie, and that turning it into a TV mini-series just somehow didn't feel right.\"",
      "Meet the Beatles",
      "Paul Mescal, 29, shot to fame in the BBC's Normal People in 2020. He went on to star in acclaimed films Aftersun, for which he was Oscar-nominated, and All of Us Strangers,  and he played the lead in the Gladiator sequel. As well as portraying Sir Paul McCartney, the Irish star is about to be seen as another British creative genius, William Shakespeare, in the film adaptation of award-winning novel Hamnet.",
      "Harris Dickinson has become a star thanks to Maleficent, The King's Man, Triangle of Sadness and Where the Crawdads Sing, before playing Kidman's love interest in Babygirl. The 28-year-old Brit also received a Bafta TV Award nomination for A Murder at the End of the World, and is among the bookmakers' favourites to be the next James Bond.",
      "Barry Keoghan bears perhaps the closest resemblance to his Beatle - drummer Ringo. The Irish actor is the oldest of the acting quartet at 32, and is one of the hottest stars in Hollywood, having been nominated for an Oscar for The Banshees of Inisherin before leading the cast of cult hit Saltburn.",
      "Joseph Quinn played Eddie Munson in the fourth season of Netflix's Stranger Things, was in A Quiet Place: Day One, and appeared alongside Mescal in Gladiator II. Before appearing as guitarist Harrison, the 31-year-old Londoner will be seen as Johnny Storm/Human Torch in The Fantastic Four: First Steps and two Avengers films.",
      "Although several previous movies like Backbeat, Nowhere Boy and I Wanna Hold Your Hand have depicted The Beatles, this is the first time that all four band members and their estates have granted full life story and music rights for a scripted film.",
      "Sir Sam called the films the \"first bingeable theatrical experience\", adding: \"Frankly, we need big cinematic events to get people out of the house.\"",
      "On stage, Dickinson, Mescal, Keoghan and Quinn recited from the band's song Sgt Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band: \"It's wonderful to be here, it's certainly a thrill, you're such a lovely audience, we'd like to take you home with us.\"",
      "They then gave a Beatles-style synchronised bow.",
      "Formed in 1960, the original band transformed youth culture and changed the course of musical history.",
      "Restlessly imaginative and experimental, they had an uncanny ability to communicate sophisticated musical ideas to a mass audience, on albums including Revolver, Sgt Pepper's and The White Album.",
      "Despite splitting in 1970, the quartet remain the biggest-selling band of all time.",
      "Only two members survive. John Lennon was murdered in 1980, while Harrison died of cancer in 2001.",
      "In 2023, the surviving members released what was described as the Beatles' \"final\" song, Now And Then.",

      "He was returned to prison six weeks later after it was found he had breached his licence conditions by allegedly viewing downloaded images of children.",

      "An acrimonious boardroom battle has seen Prince Harry, his co-founder Prince  Seeiso of Lesotho and trustees resign from their roles at the charity and insiders claimed personality clashes and tensions around leadership of the charity added to Sentebale's challenges.",
      "The financial fears were despite the charity receiving an extra \u00a31.2m from Prince Harry's earnings from his best-selling memoir Spare.",
      "Sentebale said it had successfully hired consultants to find new US donors \u2013 and the one-off money from Spare was \"incredibly useful\"  but did not represent a long-term \"funding pipeline\".",
      "The claims and counter-claims over Sentebale are set to be examined by the Charity Commission, which will have to decide whether to escalate the concerns to a full statutory inquiry.",
      "The watchdog is likely to hear financial concerns from former trustees, who resigned earlier this month after the chair Sophie Chandauka refused to step down.",
      "\"It is devastating that the relationship between the charity's trustees and the chair of the board broke down beyond repair, creating an untenable situation,\" said a statement from those trustees leaving the charity.",
      "Among the likely claims are that \u00a3500,000 of Sentebale's money was spent on consultants in a strategy to get donations from wealthy individuals and foundations in the US, but which sources close to former trustees say had not delivered results.",
      "Insiders say that if the US fundraising strategy had worked this crisis in running the charity might have been averted.",
      "Ms Chandauka has widely used the title \"Dr\" both for the Sentebale charity and other business settings. This is a reference to an honorary award from Coventry University and is not an academic or medical qualification.",
      "A spokeswoman for Sentebale told the BBC that the use of \"Dr\" was a \"matter of personal choice\" and there was \"no legal restriction preventing honorary degree recipients from using the title\".",
      "A Sentebale spokeswoman rejected the claim that \u00a3500,000 had been spent on US consultants - and defended its approach to seeking new funds for a charity.",
      "The charity told the BBC that it had hired a US firm called Lebec to help build a new fundraising strategy, and that by October 2024 a team of six consultants had set up 65 key relationships with potential donors, who might help Sentebale in the future.",
      "It said the 12-month deal with Lebec, a women-led strategy firm, had successfully delivered links to \"high-net-worth individuals, family offices, corporations, foundations and partner non-profits\".",
      "\"Lebec provided the positioning strategy, the tools, and the insights to enter the US market successfully and with credibility,\" said a spokeswoman for Sentebale..",

    "story": [
      "The prime minister has told the makers of hit Netflix drama Adolescence that it was \"really hard to watch\" with his teenage children, as he hosted a Downing Street meeting to discuss the influence of toxic material online.",
      "Sir Keir Starmer said the show, about a 13-year-old boy accused of murdering a girl from his class, served as \"a torch that shines intensely brightly on a combination of issues that many people don't know how to respond to\".",
      "But he warned there was not a \"silver bullet response\" or \"some policy lever that can be pulled\".",
      "Sir Keir also welcomed a move by Netflix to make the series available to screen for free in secondary schools.",
      "The programme has sparked a national conversation about the impact of social media and \"manosphere\" influencers.",
      "Jack Thorne, who wrote the show with actor Stephen Graham, recently said the prime minister should \"rather urgently\" consider a smartphone ban in schools and a \"digital age of consent\", similar to Australia, which has passed a law banning children under 16 from using social media.",
      "Thorne and producer Jo Johnson gave their views to Sir Keir at Monday's meeting, along with charities including the NSPCC and Children's Society, and young people. Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy was also there.",
      "The prime minister told them the show was \"at times harrowing\" but had \"lit a touch paper\" under the debate about the issues.",
      "\"We've been watching with our children - my boy is 16, my girl is 14 - and I have to say, I found it really hard,\" he told BBC political editor Chris Mason.",
      "It was so arresting, he said, because \"in a sense, what happens in the drama could really happen anywhere, and almost happen to any child\".",
      "It shone a light \"on misogyny, on online content, and this sense of children, particularly boys, getting drawn in to this world\", he said.",
      "But unlike some things the government deals with, \"there isn't an obvious policy response which will answer all of these questions\", he added.",
      "\"It's much broader than that. It's a cultural issue, and therefore we're going to have to look more broadly, work as a society on this, and discuss it, which is why I'm really pleased that Adolescence is now going to be shown in schools free because I do think young people should be watching it.\"",
      "Netflix announced that the drama would be available to all UK secondary schools through the Into Film+ schools streaming service.",
      "Asked about banning phones in schools, which has also been proposed by the Conservative opposition, he said 97% of schools were already doing that - so it was \"not, to my mind, the central issue\".",
      "\"If we're going to get to grips with this, I personally would much rather we focus on what I think is the real issue, which is, whether you're at school or elsewhere, what are you actually accessing? Because that, for me, is the critical issue,\" he said.",
      "\"And whether it's at school or elsewhere, there's material that clearly shouldn't be accessed.\"",
      "The government has pointed to measures including the Online Safety Act, which says social media companies will have to protect children from harmful material including pornography, material promoting self-harm, bullying and content encouraging dangerous stunts.",
      "Platforms will be expected to adopt \"age assurance technologies\" to prevent children from seeing harmful content.",
      "Sir Keir said it was \"an important piece of legislation\", but that \"we should go back and revisit whether there's further work that we need to do to protect young people\".",
      "The PM also denied a suggestion that showing the programme in schools would demonise boys who spend a lot of time online but haven't ended up like Jamie in Adolescence.",
      "\"I think it's probably wrong to think that there's just a group of boys that are drawn to this [material],\" he told BBC Radio 1's Newsbeat.",
      "\"Certainly, there's a group that are drawn to the extreme edges of this, and we see that in the drama, of course, but I think many boys would be somewhere, possibly, on a continuum here.\"",
      "School screenings",
      "The government is also updating its guidance on how schools should teach children about relationships, sex and health education (RSHE).",
      "The Times recently reported that it would include \"lessons to counter misogyny and the growing appeal of influencers such as Andrew Tate\", in the wake of the discussions about Adolescence.",
      "Speaking afterwards, Thorne said it was a \"brilliant\" meeting.",
      "\"The brilliant thing was that it wasn't about us,\" he said. \"It was about facilitating conversations with charities and youth groups who really understand what's going on, and I hope a solution can be found to this problem.\"",
      "The success of Adolescence has helped those charities and groups get \"the opportunity to have conversations that they haven't had before and that they should have had, and that might lead to a policy change and things being made better for our young people\", he added.",

      "\"I can't admit to something I didn't do,\" the 37-year-old said on Monday at a press conference in Seoul.",
      "At the centre of the controversy are two allegations: that Kim Soo-hyun dated Kim Sae-ron when she was 15 - a minor - and that his agency pressured her to repay a loan she owed him.",
      "The scandal has shocked South Korea and its entertainment industry - and has generated a backlash against Kim Soo-Hyun, whose roles in multiple hit drama series and films has made him one of its best-known stars.",

      "The scandal broke on 10 March, less than a month after Kim Sae-ron's death. A YouTube channel, known for its controversial political content, claimed that the two had dated for six years, when she was 15. The channel has since released videos and photos it claims were taken during their relationship.",
      "Last week, the attorney representing Kim Sae-ron's family held a press conference, revealing more chat history allegedly between the two actors from 2016, when she was 16.",
      "Kim Soo-hyun's agency initially denied the allegations but later clarified that they dated, though only between 2019 and 2020, when she was an adult.",

      "\"I had so much to protect as its lead actor. What would have happened if I had admitted to a year-long relationship? What would happen to the actors, the staff who were working overnight and the production team who had everything staked on that project?\" he said. \"The more I thought of it, the more I thought that shouldn't be what I do.\"",
      "Any admission of a romantic relationship or a partner is still seen as scandalous to fans in South Korea's entertainment industry, where celebrities' personal lives come under intense scrutiny.",

      "On Monday, Kim Soo-hyun denied claims that \"she made the tragic choice because of me or my agency pressuring her over a debt\".",
      "He released a voice recording of a phone call from a year ago, allegedly between his agency and Kim Sae-ron's representative.",
      "In the recording, the CEO of GoldMedalist appears to explain that the document they sent her regarding the debt was merely for \"procedural reasons\" and that her team could take time to respond.",

    "story": [
      "Indian superstar Mohanlal has apologised and said some scenes will be removed from his new film after criticism from Hindu nationalist groups.",
      "The Malayalam-language film, L2: Empuraan, was released on Thursday and is performing well at the box office.",
      "However, it faced a backlash from Hindu groups, including members of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), over some scenes including ones seen as referring to the 2002 anti-Muslim riots in Gujarat state.",
      "\"As an artist, it is my duty to ensure that none of my films are hostile to any political movement, ideology or religious group,\" Mohanlal wrote on Facebook.",
      "\"The team of Empuraan and I sincerely regret the distress caused to my loved ones, and with the realisation that the responsibility for it lies with all of us who worked on the film, we have decided together to remove such subjects from the movie,\" added Mohanlal, who is a household name in Kerala state, which is home to the Malayalam film industry.",
      "The developments have sparked a debate around artistic freedom, with the opposition Congress and Left parties accusing the BJP of putting pressure on the filmmakers.",
      "However, BJP leaders have said that the party did not launch a public campaign against the film and that people have the right to express their views on social media.",
      "What is the movie about?",
      "L2: Empuraan is a sequel to the 2019 Malayalam political thriller Lucifer, in which Mohanlal played the role of Stephen Nedumpally, a mysterious figure who is later revealed to be the head of an international crime syndicate.",
      "The movie, directed by another Malayalam star Prithviraj, was a big hit and got mostly positive reviews.",
      "So expectations were high for L2: Empuraan, which centres on the return of Mohanlal's character as a saviour of Kerala's politics, which has fallen into the hands of corrupt and evil people.",
      "Even before its release, the film made headlines over its budget - huge for the relatively understated Malayalam film industry - and star-studded promotions.",
      "It created a buzz across Indian cities and even internationally, with opening-day shows being sold out.",
      "The film has made nearly 1.5bn rupees ($17.5mn; \u00a313.5mn) overall in its opening weekend, according to film analytics tracker Sacnilk.",
      "But the film received mixed reviews from critics.",
      "The Hindustan Times newspaper called it a film grappling with \"an identity crisis, an overlong run time and a confused mess of a script\". The Indian Express said \"the emotional depth and dramatic weight that anchored Lucifer are largely absent in Empuraan\" but praised \"Mohanlal's commanding performance\" and some other aspects of the film.",
      "What sparked the controversy?",
      "L2: Empuraan begins with the backstory of a character Zayed Masood - played by director Prithviraj - who was orphaned during riots in a place in India, with some of the details being similar to the religious violence that occurred in 2002 when Modi was chief minister of Gujarat state.",
      "The long flashback sequence shows some graphic scenes depicting Hindus committing violent crimes against Muslims during the violence.",
      "It also shows how one of the perpetrators of the violence becomes more powerful over the years and is seeking to secure a key position in Kerala's political landscape.",
      "The scenes sparked an uproar.",
      "Rajeev Chandrasekhar, the state president of the BJP, who had wished the film's team well before its release, later said that he now realised there were \"topics in the movie that disturbed Mohanlal fans and other viewers\".",
      "\"A movie should be watched as a movie. It can't be seen as history. Also, any movie that tries to build a story by distorting the truth is doomed to fail,\" he said, adding that he would not watch the film.",
      "While some state BJP leaders supported this, others criticised the makers and accused them of depicting \"anti-national themes\" in the film.",
      "The Organiser Weekly - a magazine published by the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), which is the ideological parent of the BJP - called the film a \"disturbing, divisive tale disguised as cinema\".",
      "\"Empuraan isn't just a bad film; it's an attack on faith, on political plurality and on the very soul of balanced storytelling,\" its review said.",
      "Some social media users have also called for a boycott of the film, but there has not been a large-scale online campaign or big protests against the movie.",
      "What changes would the film see?",
      "Over the weekend, Gokulam Gopalan, one of the producers of the film, said he had asked Prithviraj to make changes \"if any scenes or dialogues in Empuraan have hurt anyone\".",
      "This was followed by Mohanlal's post on Sunday which confirmed some scenes would be removed. Prithviraj shared the post on Facebook but did not offer additional comment.",
      "Some reports said the film would see as many as 17 cuts while others said a three-minute long scene would be removed and some dialogues muted. The makers have not confirmed what the changes are.",
      "The film had been cleared by India's Central Board of Film Certification - known as the censor board - which reviews movies for public exhibition. But makers have the option of resubmitting it for more cuts.",
      "Amid the controversy, L2: Empuraan has also received support from the Communist Party of India (Marxist) - which governs Kerala - and the Congress party. The two parties have a strong presence in Kerala, where the nationally powerful BJP has struggled to make inroads.",
      "Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan said the \"communal hate campaign against Empuraan and its creators is deeply disturbing\".",
      "\"Undermining creative freedom through fear and threats strikes at the very core of democracy,\" he added.",
      "\"Cinema is the work of a group of artists. Changing the content of a work of art by threatening, insulting and humiliating through social media is not a victory,\" wrote Congress leader VD Satheesan.",

    "story": [
      "\"It's just weird to talk about your sexual feelings to your parents,\" says 15-year-old Ben*.",
      "His parents, Sophie and Martin, two professionals in their 40s, nod understandingly. They are discussing the kinds of \"big issues\" Ben's social media usage throws up, and for Ben their conversations about sex and pornography are \"the worst\".",
      "The family \u2013 minus Ben's little sister, who is too young to join the discussion \u2013 are gathered in their living room to dissect the smash-hit Netflix drama Adolescence, which they watched the previous evening.",
      "The series follows the story of 13-year-old protagonist Jamie, who is accused of murdering a female peer after being exposed to misogynistic online material and subjected to cyberbullying.",
      "Both of Ben's parents are concerned their own son's behaviour is being impacted by the material he is exposed to, and Ben, who is worried himself, is trying to set limits on his own phone use.",
      "Given their concerns, and how they overlap with the themes of Adolescence, the family agreed to watch the programme together and allowed BBC News to sit in on their discussion, which ranged from the relevance of Andrew Tate to whether boys and girls can be friends.",
      "'People just call each other virgins'",
      "Ben is sitting on the sofa in the living room scrolling on his phone before the conversation begins.",
      "The parents take their seats looking relaxed despite the difficult subjects they are about to discuss. Photos of loved ones line the bookshelves in the family's living room, and a piano stands against the wall.",
      "Sophie and Martin have worked hard to create a \"very open\" household, Sophie says, where \"all topics are on the table\". While watching the programme, Sophie made a list of things to talk about with Ben.",
      "A confident and outspoken teenage boy, Ben is well-liked by fellow pupils at his single-sex state secondary school. But the qualities that make him popular with his peers often land him in trouble with his teachers, who give him detentions or send him to isolation for making what his mother describes as \"inappropriate comments\".",
      "In the show, Jamie and his peers use language associated with the \"manosphere\" \u2013 websites and online forums promoting misogyny and opposition to feminism \u2013 and incel culture. Incels, short for involuntary celibate, are men who blame women because they are unable to find a sexual partner. It is an ideology that has been linked to terror attacks and killings in recent years.",
      "Perhaps surprisingly, \"incel\" wasn't a familiar term to Ben, and his dad Martin had to explain it as they watched the programme.",
      "\"People just call each other 'virgins'. I've not heard 'incel' before,\" Ben tells his parents. He suggests the term might have \"dropped off\" social media for young people in recent years, reflecting the pace at which the conversation moves online.",
      "Ben tells his parents there are elements of the show he recognises, including its depiction of the fights and cyberbullying at school. But he thinks it is only a \"rough picture\" of what it's like to be a teenager today, and that it was principally made for \"an adult who isn't online\".",
      "For example, it neglects to show the good side of social media alongside its dangers, he says, and some details \u2013 including the secret emoji codes one character claims children use \u2013 ring false.",
      "It is for this reason that Martin, who says he enjoyed the tense drama, also feels the show is playing on every parent's \"worst nightmare\" about their child's phone use, meaning it sometimes favours theatrics over realism in an attempt to \"shock\" adults into action.",
      "Andrew Tate, an influencer and central figure of the shadowy online world of the manosphere, is mentioned by name in the drama and has been the cause of much concern among parents and teachers. But Ben says that while Andrew Tate was \"popular\" at his school about two years ago, he is now \"old news\".",
      "Ben has noticed the way Tate combines health and wellbeing with politics. \"Some of his things, like 'exercise for an hour a day' \u2013 fair enough, that's correct. But then he combines it with far-right ideas, like 'the man should go out and work and the wife should stay at home',\" Ben says.",
      "Both parents agree that Tate is not to blame for misogyny. As far as they're concerned, he is symptomatic of \"a bigger social problem\".",
      "Can boys and girls be friends?",
      "This problem is represented starkly in the bleak picture Adolescence paints of male-female friendships in the social media age. Protagonist Jamie doesn't have any female friends, and appears to view relations with the opposite sex through a lens of dominance and manipulation.",
      "Sophie is concerned that interactions between boys and girls are distant and impersonal in Ben's peer group. She says Ben doesn't have many opportunities to mix with girls his age.",
      "And she worries her son is getting most of his information about how to interact with girls from social media. \"It's really twisted,\" she says. \"They don't know how to behave around each other.\"",
      "She asks her son a question: \"If you don't know how to talk to girls when you're feeling awkward, if you're like, 'Eurgh, I don't know how to dress', where do you go for help?\"",
      "\"Online,\" Ben says.",
      "\"So it goes full circle,\" says his mum. \"That's where they get information.\"",
      "Ben isn't embarrassed that he's \"used ChatGPT for like two years\" to get this sort of advice. \"Or TikTok,\" he adds.",

      "Netflix drama Adolescence hailed as 'flawless' TV",
      "Netflix's Adolescence makes UK TV ratings history",
      "Sophie says Ben learned most about friendship with the opposite sex during a visit to a cousin's house, who attends a mixed school and has female friends.",
      "She recalls Ben's cousin reprimanding him after Ben asked whether the cousin was attracted to a female friend.",
      "\"I don't remember him getting annoyed with me like that, but okay,\" Ben says.",
      "They debate their varying recollections of events until they land on a version on which they can agree: \"His cousin was like, 'No, that's my friend. I don't think of them in that way,'\" Sophie says.",
      "\"That was really eye-opening for him,\" she says. Turning to Ben, she recalls: \"You came back from it, and you were like, 'It's much better [at my cousin's], girls and boys are friends.'\"",
      "Sharing intimate images",
      "In the Netflix drama, it is revealed that Jamie's victim Katie had been subjected to misogynistic bullying after a male classmate shared intimate images of her without her consent.",
      "Jamie's discussion of this incident with a child psychologist, played by Erin Doherty, is pivotal to the programme's acclaimed third episode.",
      "Ben has seen this kind of abuse of trust among his peers too. \"There's a guy near here, and [a picture of] his genitals got leaked on a massive group chat with loads of people,\" he says. \"That was a big thing on TikTok.\"",
      "The series kicks off with an episode in which police question Jamie about the sexualised images of adult women he has shared on his Instagram page, hinting at the ease with which young teenagers can access pornography.",
      "This feels familiar to Ben, who thinks porn is the \"biggest issue\" among his peer group. He knows boys who are \"addicted\" to it: \"They rely on it. There are people in my year who'll have such a bad day unless they watch it.\"",
      "Ben squirms a little while talking about pornography, staring at the wall or fiddling with his phone.",
      "He seems more comfortable talking about the other forms of concerning content young people come across online.",
      "He estimates that \"one in 10\" videos he watches on his phone contain distressing material, including scenes of extreme violence. And Ben's parents are under no illusions that their son is \"safe\" just because he is upstairs on his computer - unlike Jamie's parents in the show.",
      "What can be done?",
      "For Martin and Sophie, the solution lies in giving children better opportunities to \"participate\" in society and build their self-esteem.",
      "They say they are also keen for their son to have \"wide range\" of male role models to learn from. Ben, who has paused to check his phone several times in the course of their discussion, re-engages with the conversation.",
      "He is animated in his praise for his sports coaches, whose \"really strong morals\" he admires.",
      "The parents nod, evidently pleased by his enthusiasm. They say they pack their son's life with activities in an attempt to get him off his phone. But this is expensive, they say, and puts poorer students at a disadvantage.",
      "Sophie says of the show's main character, Jamie: \"He doesn't have sport. He doesn't feel good about himself. His dad looks away when he fails.\"",
      "Adolescence shows that children with limited opportunities to build their self-esteem are more \"vulnerable\" to the predatory messages of misogynistic influencers, Sophie says.",
      "Both parents agree tech companies, the government, schools and families all have a responsibility to offer young people a convincing alternative to the siren call of the manosphere.",
      "They insist parents can't do it alone. As Sophie says: \"It's a tsunami and someone's given me an umbrella.\"",
      "Ben thinks what happens online is too often dismissed by adults as being irrelevant to the real world. He thinks this is a mistake; social media should be treated \"like real life \u2013 because it is real life\", he says.",

      "AI in Hollywood is \"inevitable\", says Bryn Mooser, the party's host and the co-founder of Moonvalley, which created the AI generator tool Marey by paying for footage from filmmakers with their consent. Mooser says that while AI may still be a dirty word, their product is \"clean\" because it pays for its content.",
      "\"Artists should be at the table,\" he says, adding that it's better to build the tool for filmmakers rather than get \"rolled over by big tech companies\".",

      "But it's AI's creators, and not the technology itself, that has received the brunt of real-life criticism. Companies use publicly available data to build their AI models - which includes copyrighted material shared online - and creators say they're being ripped off.",

      "\"We've all fought very hard for copyright laws, and nobody wants to see their work stolen to have somebody else profit from it,\" Mooser says.",
      "Hollywood has begun toying with the new technology. The Oscar-nominated films Emilia Perez and The Brutalist used AI to alter voices. Adrian Brody won the Academy Award for best actor, even with the help of AI to fine tune his accent when he spoke Hungarian in his starring role in The Brutalist. AI has even been used to de-age actors like Tom Hanks and Harrison Ford.",
      "The technology is seemingly everywhere. OpenAI hosted an AI film festival in Los Angeles earlier this month. Marvel directors Joe and Anthony Russo told the Wall Street Journal they plan to invest $400 million to craft AI tools for filmmakers.",
      "But the impacts on how it will alter the future of the entertainment industry remain unclear. Generative AI, for instance, allows computers to learn and solve problems in ways that can seem human \u2013 albeit much faster. And many worry about the technology replacing their jobs as AI is used to generate scripts, animation, locations, voices and human actors.",

    "summary": "SIX The Musical Live! also hits cinemas, and we're finally going to find out about the Switch 2.",
    "story": [
      "This week, another hit game becomes a feature film \u2013 A Minecraft Movie is out on Friday.",
      "But that's not all the week has in store.",
      "Trending TikTok star Djo (aka Steve from Stranger Things) has a new album out, SIX The Musical Live! hits cinemas, and we're finally going to find out about the Switch 2.",
      "Read on for what's coming up this week...",
      "Mining for big screen success",
      "It's been heavily delayed, but A Minecraft Movie is finally here.",
      "The wildly popular video game hits the big screen on Friday and boasts a star-studded cast including Jason Momoa, Jack Black and Jennifer Coolidge.",
      "It tells the story of four misfits who are suddenly pulled through a mysterious portal into the Overworld \u2013 the place where all players start in Minecraft.",
      "Minecraft is one of the world's best selling video games, so there\u2019s a lot of pressure to deliver for fans of the blocky world (my 11-year-old nephew is legitimately more excited for this than Christmas).",
      "\"This game has been loved by millions and millions all over the world for years now, and I think this movie is a big deal for a lot of people, because now it's generational,\" Black said.",
      "There's been a long history of game-to-film flops. But others, such as Sonic, were massive hits, so that's what Warner Bros will no doubt be hoping for.",
      "Djo know what I mean?",
      "By Mark Savage, music correspondent",
      "American actor Joe Keery is best known as reformed jock Steve Harrington, one of the main (and most loveable) characters in the sci-fi series Stranger Things.",
      "But he's also got a nifty line in throwback indie-pop, which he performs as Djo. The pseudonym was initially an attempt to avoid the accusations he was trading on his fame. He'd even perform in disguise.",
      "That changed when he had a breakout hit with End of Beginning \u2013 a synth-heavy slice of psychedelia that went viral on TikTok last year, often the soundtrack to videos about what people would do if they won the lottery.",
      "Stranger Things finale filming was 'incredibly emotional'",
      "The attention put a rocket under his music career. While his first two albums were DIY affairs, recorded in a couple of days and self-released, his latest, The Crux, was created in New York's fabled Electric Lady studios.",
      "Released on Friday, it's packed full of off-kilter lyrics and squiggly synth lines that burrow into your brain. The first two singles, Delete Ya and Basic Being Basic have already been radio hits, and the rest of the album pulls on influences as diverse as Electric Light Orchestra, New Order, Cake, Hall & Oates and Bruce Springsteen (coincidentally, all bands that would work perfectly on the Stranger Things soundtrack).",
      "There are a couple of knockouts \u2013 including the crunchy garage rock of Gap Toothed Smile, and the choppy New Wave anthem Link \u2013 but the point of the album is its diversity. Keery envisioned each song as the story of a separate guest at a hotel where everyone is at a spiritual or emotional crossroads.",
      "The Queens on screen",
      "SIX the Musical tells the story of the many wives of Henry VIII, as they step out of the shadow of their infamous husband and reclaim the narrative.",
      "Now, the queens are moving to the screen.",
      "A filmed stage production of SIX The Musical Live!, featuring the original West End cast, will be released in cinemas on Sunday.",
      "Creators Toby Marlow and Lucy Moss told me what to expect.",
      "\u201cIt's not simply a live capture of what's on stage, but an immersive, pop-concert experience,\u201d they said.",
      "\u201cYou get to witness the incredible performances up close \u2013 noticing little details and subtleties you might miss in the theatre. But you also get exciting, inventive, explosive visuals that make you feel like part of the party.\u201d",
      "It's the big Switch 2 reveal",
      "By Tom Gerken, tech reporter",
      "This week has been in the diaries of gaming fans around the world for months, as we finally are about to learn what's coming with the Switch 2, the much-anticipated sequel to the Nintendo Switch, aka the third-best selling console in history.",
      "So it's no surprise that we're going to get some news on Wednesday \u2013 but the question is, what?",
      "Almost certainly Nintendo will unveil a price and a launch date. But quite what that will be, who knows \u2013 July 2025 feels like a safe bet, but to be fair, would anyone be surprised if it came out in December?",
      "Fans are desperate for news on games. The rumour mill swirls with talks of a new Mario, Zelda and Pok\u00e9mon, but nobody has any proof to back it up. (I'd personally bite your hand off for a new Fire Emblem, but that's just me\u2026)",
      "Will we see super flashy new graphics? A high quality screen? A better battery life? There are too many questions to list.",
      "Only one thing is really certain \u2013 whatever happens, when Nintendo's announcement is over, we'll be left counting down the days to the console's actual release\u2026 whenever that may be.",

    "published": "Sun, 30 Mar 2025 04:40:50 GMT",
    "summary": "The opening night of the star's tour mixes flashes of brilliance with moments that fail to connect.",
    "story": [
      "Usher has kicked off a 10-night residency at London's O2 Arena with a slick, two-hour show that was impressive and frustrating in equal measure.",
      "The US pop star played more than 40 songs, including hits like Yeah, Burn, U Remind Me and OMG, with multiple costume changes and buttery-smooth choreography.",
      "But the show, which comes to the UK after a 62-date run in the US, felt oddly rough around the edges - including a handful of on-stage stumbles and missed musical cues.",
      "The momentum was frequently torpedoed by waffly, overlong video interludes - but Usher's magnetic stage presence just about held the concert together.",
      "Titled \"Past, Present, Future\", the tour is billed as an \"intimate\" look at Usher Raymond IV's 30-year career, as well as \"a glimpse into the future\".",
      "It comes as the star, one of the best-selling artists of the 2000s, is enjoying a career rebirth - following an acclaimed Super Bowl half-time show, and the release of his ninth studio album, Coming Home.",
      "With 10 sold-out shows at the O2, he enters an elite group of artists who've played double-digit residencies at the venue, alongside Queen (10 shows in 2022), Bon Jovi (12 nights in 2010) and Prince (21 nights in 2007).",
      "At its core, Past, Present, Future illustrates the skill with which the 46-year-old has navigated the evolving trends of the music industry.",
      "We see a video clip of him, aged 14, dancing to his debut single, Call Me A Mack, then watch as he transforms into a teenage heartthrob, a confessional balladeer, an EDM party-starter, and an elder statesman of R&B.",
      "He arrives from under the stage in a fog of dry ice and a cone of laser beams, apparently controlling the lights with his bare hands, before dancing to the middle of the arena with the molten fluidity of his idol, Michael Jackson.",
      "Clad in a sparkly raincoat and wide-brimmed Pharrell hat, he races through hits like Coming Home, Hey Daddy and U Make Me Wanna, backed by a funky 10-piece band and a dance team that echoes his every move.",
      "The choreography is a constant highlight. Usher's moves are so effortless that they look unrehearsed, but such ease comes at a cost: Last year, he had to postpone the start of the tour after injuring his neck in practice.",
      "At the O2, that pain seemed a distant memory, as he careened around the U-shaped stage on roller skates, pulling off a flawless moonwalk, and even freeze-framing in a handstand.",
      "He might have fumbled a hat at one point, but it was one of his dancers who came closest to calamity - losing his balance during an elaborate chair routine, sending the chair spinning across the stage.",
      "The band also suffered a mishap, missing Usher's cue to extend the intro to Superstar, and coming in four bars early. Not disastrous, but still unusual for a show on this level.",
      "The hits were punctuated by numerous interludes, narrated by Celeste, a glitch-prone \"computer driven by AI technology to help Mr Raymond tell his story\",  from teen wannabe to global superstar, against a backdrop of infidelity, tabloid infamy, redemption and survival.",
      "The problem was his songs couldn't support the weight of that story. With a few exceptions, Usher mostly sings about lusting after women in the club, and carnal pleasures in the bedroom.",
      "The result was a weirdly disconnected show, where Usher followed a moving video about his absent father with a song about his ex, which he sung while straddling a motorbike.",
      "Priapism was a running theme. Women in the audience were fed with cocktail cherries (\"oh, it's your first time?\" Usher mugged into the camera)  and part of the stage was turned into a strip club, complete with pole dancers, during Bad Girl.",
      "That sort of tongue-in-cheek raunch has been a hallmark of Usher's career, but it felt dated and shallow in a concert that promised an intimate look into his personality.",
      "Perhaps he just wanted us to know that, deep down, he really, really likes sex.",
      "Luckily, the songs still hold up. A trio of quiet storm ballads - Climax, Burn and Confessions Part II - had couples serenading each other, while a trio of women near me took the opportunity to slow dance a security guard who was mopping the floor.",
      "To his credit, Usher sang everything live, with an airy falsetto that's undiminished after 30 years on tour. During U Got It Bad, he held one sustained note for over 10 seconds.",
      "At times, he struggled to hold the audience's attention during the slow jams. The UK has always preferred him in club mode - and it was his three biggest-sellers, Yeah, OMG and DJ Got Us Falling In Love that really set the O2 alight.",
      "Strangely it was one of those empty club anthems, I Am The Party, that ultimately carried the most meaning.",
      "\"Hopefully my [music] has been something to you,\" Usher said over the introduction.",
      "\"Maybe we fell in love together, maybe we had a good time together, but something brought you here. And I just want you to know, I appreciate the connection.\"",
      "\"If I didn't have you to cheer me on, I wouldn't continue to do this.\"",
      "Pop stars say this sort of thing all the time. But as he stood at the O2, drenched in sweat, remembering the father who abandoned him and soaking up the audience's affection, Usher didn't seem to be putting on an act.",
      "By the encore, he'd given up all pretence of being a high-rolling playboy.",
      "Instead, he bounded around the stage, giddily filming the audience on his phone, as they hollered out the chorus to Without You.",
      "If only that performer had shown up earlier."

    "summary": "The 23-year-old star of Disney's remake has become a battleground on social media.",
    "story": [
      "Whether you like the new Snow White film or you hate it, it's hard to escape the debate around its lead actress, Rachel Zegler.",
      "The 23-year-old star has dominated conversation about the film, as people either blame her for its poor reviews or leap to her defence, saying she's being unfairly maligned.",
      "And this debate is not new for Zegler.",
      "Way before Snow White came out, she has been at the centre of the storm, with many criticising her take on the original film and her political views, including those on US President Donald Trump and his voters.",
      "Others defended her, and expressed discomfort at seeing such a young actress suffer a pile-on.",
      "Film critic Kelechi Ehenulo calls Zegler a victim of \"culture wars\", and warns actors from underrepresented backgrounds (Zegler is Latina) often find themselves becoming \"targets for backlash\".",
      "So how did we get to this point \u2013 and where does Zegler go from here?",
      "A blame game",
      "Let's start with the film itself.",
      "Disney's live-action version of the classic fairy tale Snow White was released earlier this month, and has faced a slew of underwhelming reviews (the Observer's Wendy Ide described it as \"toe-curlingly terrible\".) US reviewers have been somewhat more positive \u2013 but despite it topping the North America box office chart, it hasn't made as much money as expected.",
      "On social media, some people have been quick to point their finger at Zegler, arguing she hampered the release.",
      "They include Jonah Platt, the son of Snow White producer Marc Platt. Earlier this week, he took aim at Zegler in a fiery social media post. It has since been deleted, but was screenshotted by multiple outlets including the New York Post.",
      "He said Zegler had \"[dragged] her personal politics\" into the film's promotional campaign, adding: \"Her actions clearly hurt the film's box office.\"",
      "Platt didn't respond to a request for comment from BBC News.",
      "The controversies started much earlier.",
      "Before the film was released, Zegler faced abuse online by people who disagreed with her casting in the role of a character deemed to have skin \"as white as snow\".",
      "Zegler made headlines after her comments, in 2022, about the original film. \"There's a big focus [in the original] on her love story with a guy who literally stalks her. Weird! So we didn't do that this time.\"",
      "Zegler also said the original film was \"extremely dated when it comes to the ideas of women being in roles of power\", adding: \"People are making these jokes about ours being the PC Snow White, where it's like, yeah, it is - because it needed that.\"",
      "Disney holds small-scale Snow White premiere amid controversy",
      "Disney holds small-scale Snow White premiere amid controversy",
      "Many saw those words as a rebuke against Disney's tradition.",
      "The Daily Mail branded it a \"woke tirade\" and an article this week in Variety said she \"trashed the beloved original Snow White\".",
      "City AM's film editor Victoria Luxford says criticism of the original film \"was never going to work out well. These films are marketed on nostalgia, on making you feel like you did when you saw the original, so to speak of it negatively seemed puzzling\".",
      "Zegler declined to comment on this piece.",
      "But Anna Smith, film critic and host of the Girls On Film podcast, told BBC News that some of the headlines may have be misleading.",
      "\"Zegler pointed out that times and attitudes have changed, and that the new Snow White has been adapted for the current age. This is the case with many remakes and reboots, many of which do not make the headlines with comments about 'woke' culture.\"",
      "Zegler's political views have also sparked a backlash.",
      "Last summer, she thanked fans for their response to the film's trailer in a post on X, adding, \"and always remember, free Palestine\".",
      "According to the Variety article, Marc Platt - mentioned above - flew to New York to speak directly with Zegler after the post.",
      "Neither Zegler nor Platt have responded to a request for a comment on that.",
      "Zegler also stoked controversy with her views after the 2024 US presidential election. Writing on Instagram, she said she hoped \"Trump voters and Trump himself never know peace\".",
      "She later apologised for what she had said.",
      "Some commend her for speaking her mind. Ehenulo says that she is \"not the first and certainly not the last actor to be speaking about politics\".",
      "And Luxford told me she was \"hard-pressed\" to imagine the film's core audience, children under 10, being swayed by her politics.",
      "But film critic Conor Riley said that her comments about Trump didn't \"help the stability of the movie's release\".",
      "He notes that Gal Gadot, who plays Snow White's stepmother, the Evil Queen, has also faced a backlash from some people. Gadot, who is Israeli, has been vocal in her support of the country.",
      "The timing of the film also didn't help, he added.",
      "\"Ultimately, [Zegler] became a lightning rod for controversy, not just due to her own actions, but because Snow White landed at the intersection of Hollywood's creative stagnation, racial politics, international conflict, and America's deep ideological divide,\" he said.",
      "'Targets for backlash'",
      "Some, like Luxford, argue that some of the pile-on comes from \"a place of prejudice\".",
      "\"She's a young Latina woman with political opinions that don't align with certain groups, who are quick to voice their anger,\" she said.",
      "Zegler is far from the first young female actress to find herself facing a toxic backlash. Recently, Stranger Things actor Millie Bobby Brown criticised press articles about her appearance, saying \"this isn't journalism, this is bullying\".",
      "Smith notes that women in positions of prominence are more likely to be targeted in this way.",
      "\"When women in the public eye are criticised, there is often bias at work. Regardless of the topic, the way it's dealt with, talked about and reported will often differ compared to the way men are treated,\" she said.",
      "Ehenulo, for her part, calls on the industry to do more to protect their stars.",
      "\"What irks me is how easy [people of colour] actors become targets for backlash on social media and yet the culture of silence from studios, news outlets and social media platforms says it all,\" she said.",
      "\"That lack of public protection... means the toxicity continues to fester and rise. It's the Wild West out there and I can't see it getting better when this has been normalised to such an extent.\"",
      "We put those claims to Disney, but they declined to comment.",
      "The big roles keep coming for Zegler. She is now signed up to star in Evita in the West End this summer, and on Friday, she made a splash in a different way - reading a CBeebies Bedtime Story.",
      "At the end of the story, Zegler tells young viewers: \"To be a powerful princess you just need to be wonderful, brilliant you!\" For some, this is a message that encapsulates Zegler herself.",
      "\"I don't know if she's going to be doing another Disney film anytime soon,\" says Luxford, \"but she's 23, she's a Golden Globe winner, and she's a very talented actor.\"",

    "summary": "The Liverpool anthem Does This Train Stop On Merseyside? is 20 years old this year.",
    "story": [
      "Ian Prowse was standing in his local pub literally crying into his beer about the end of a relationship when someone came in to tell him one of his songs had just been played on Radio 1.",
      "Told it was \"a song about a train\", Prowse, the former frontman of 1990s band Pele, was perplexed. At the time he had no record deal and the song he knew it must have been, Does This Train Stop On Merseyside? had not been released.",
      "He would then find out that BBC DJ John Peel had got hold of a copy, and had told his listeners that the song \u2013 a poignant love letter to Liverpool, warts and all \u2013 had moved him to tears.",
      "Twenty years on from its release, it has been covered by Irish folk star Christy Moore, championed by Elvis Costello, and has become an anthem for the city - not least for its raw reflections on the Hillsborough disaster of 1989, whose 36th anniversary will be commemorated this month.",
      "Prowse, now 61, had been the frontman of the 1990s band Pele, and was playing with his new outfit Amsterdam when Does This Train Stop On Merseyside? came to him as he sat at home one afternoon.",
      "The inspiration came from the story of William McKenzie, a Victorian merchant who rests in a pyramid-shaped tomb in the graveyard of St Andrew's church in Liverpool, supposedly buried sitting upright clutching a winning hand of cards.",
      "From that germ of inspiration, which gave the song its opening lines, the rest of the verses quickly flowed.",
      "\"I was on the floor at this point,\" he says. \"The music industry had changed with the likes of the X Factor, and if you were over 30 you were essentially dead in the water.",
      "\"I was really struggling, and then John Peel started playing the song and then suddenly we had a record deal again.\"",
      "The song was to receive an even bigger break when Irish folk star Moore came across it after a gig in Manchester, when a CD containing it was posted through the open window of his car by a fan as he left the Bridgewater Hall.",
      "\"By the time we got to London, I was in love with the song,\" says Moore.",
      "\"One of the great privileges of my life has been that I get to sing the songs of people like Ian Prowse.\"",
      "For Elvis Costello, some of the song's charm lies in Prowse's \"acute sense of the history of the city\".",
      "There are references in Does This Train Stop On Merseyside? to the Atlantic slave trade, of which Liverpool was the home; the influx of Irish immigrants fleeing the potato famine of the 1840s and 1850s, and the events of 15 April 1989, reflected in the lyrics \"Yorkshire policemen fold their arms while people try and save their fellow fans\".",
      "Prowse adds: \"For people of my generation. Hillsborough was the central event. I had so many friends who were survivors, I could not write a song that's talking about Liverpool without including that.",
      "\"For the city it was a double tragedy: there was the horror of 97 people losing their lives, then there was the city being smeared in the media.",
      "\"There's still righteous fury about that in the city, and although the truth has come out, there's never been any justice really.\"",
      "Journalist Paul Du Noyer, who has written extensively about Liverpool and the Beatles, says of the song that it manages to encompass \"the very worst things in human history to the sheer fun of being out in Mathew Street\".",
      "He adds it \"ranked as one of the great Liverpool songs in that it was explicitly about Liverpool in the way that \u2013 to put it in distinguished company \u2013 Strawberry Fields Forever was, and Penny Lane\".",
      "For Prowse, who on 12 April will be performing the song at The Arts Club in Liverpool with the full seven-piece Amsterdam band to mark the 20th anniversary of its release, it is always humbling to see how well the song is received both on Merseyside and further afield.",
      "\"It's great to see how it travels so well,\" he says. \"It's always people's favourite song of mine whether I'm playing in Dublin or Glasgow, but also if I'm doing acoustic shows in Stroud or Perth or wherever.\"",
      "But there is no doubt that the most full-throated appreciation comes when Does This Train Stop On Merseyside? is played to a home crowd that knows the city and feels about it the way Prowse himself does.",
      "\"For all the darkness, and the bad things that have happened, it's still my favourite place in the whole world and it's somewhere I'd rather be than anywhere else,\" he says.",
      "\"The spirit, the heart of the place is amazing, and not necessarily despite of the bad things that have happened, but in some ways because of them.\"",

      "His salesman father had a problem with drink, which affected young Richard's childhood. He described himself as a \"shy, serious, lugubrious kid, painfully thin, with a long, sad face\".",

      "He was handsome enough: with profiles at the time gushing over his \"fine-lined aristocratic face, suggesting a young Florentine noble - straight out of the Renaissance\".",

      "Chamberlain got 12,000 letters a week. In Pittsburgh, 450,000 people turned out to see him at a parade, and in New York, he nearly caused a riot when a child spotted him and called his name.",
      "The studio made the most of this attention, releasing novels, comics and games featuring Chamberlain's image.",
      "Fans would even write in asking \"Dr Kildare\" to solve their various medical problems.",
      "And Chamberlain had an unlikely hit single: Three Stars Will Shine Tonight, where romantic words were added to the show's distinctive opening theme tune.",
      "He won a Golden Globe Award for best TV actor in 1963. But, three years later audiences began to wane, and NBC pulled the plug.",
      "Now an international star, Chamberlain struggled to leave Kildare behind.",
      "In 1966, he hoped to break into films, but reviews slated his performance in the light romantic comedy, Joy in the Morning.",
      "Audiences, they said, laughed in \"all the wrong places\". So, he resolved to ignore Hollywood and make a living on the stage.",
      "He got off to a rocky start when a musical version of Breakfast at Tiffany's - in which he starred opposite Mary Tyler Moore - closed after just four shows.",
      "The production is still seen as one of Broadway's biggest ever turkeys. But a move to England gave him a chance of reinventing himself as a 'serious actor.'",
      "In 1967, there were starring roles in Henry James' Portrait of a Lady and opposite Katherine Hepburn in a satirical comedy called The Madwoman of Chaillot.",
      "And, two years later, he became the first American to play Hamlet at the Birmingham Repertory Theatre since the great John Barrymore in 1925.",
      "This time, the reviews were excellent and he revisited the role of Denmark's most tortured prince for a television version for Hallmark.",
      "But Chamberlain was cast as Tchaikovsky in Ken Russell's overblown biopic, The Music Lovers, in which he starred opposite Glenda Jackson.",
      "The critics rubbished the film, in which great play was made of the relationship between a composer with repressed homosexual tendencies and his nymphomaniac wife, although it later became something of a cult success.",
      "Chamberlain went on to play Lord Byron opposite Sarah Miles in Lady Caroline Lamb and the swashbuckling French swordsman Aramis in Richard Lester's The Three Musketeers.",
      "He also appeared - along with half of Hollywood - in the Towering Inferno, as a crooked electrical engineer whose corner-cutting leads to the spectacular destruction of a 138 floor building.",
      "In 1977, the TV series Roots - set in the era of American slavery - drew huge audiences and was nominated for nearly 40 Emmy awards.",
      "It sparked a revival of the mini-series which drew Chamberlain back to television.",
      "He beat Roger Moore and Albert Finney to be cast as John Blackthorn - a captive English navigator in 17th Century Japan - in Shogun.",
      "The series was shown on NBC over five nights in 1980, with audiences reaching nearly 30 million.",
      "Having won a Golden Globe, Chamberlain then picked up another as Father Ralph de Bricassart in The Thorn Birds, a priest torn between God and his sexual longing for the actress, Rachel Ward.",
      "It was even more successful than Shogun, winning an audience of 60% of television viewers and 16 Emmy nominations.",
      "In the 1990s, Chamberlain's career began to wane.",
      "There were a succession of solid, rather than outstanding, performances in made-for-TV films and endless guest appearances in other people's shows.",
      "These included a sequel to The Thorn Birds called The Missing Years, with Amanda Donohoe replacing Rachel Ward.",
      "In 2003, long after he had stopped playing romantic leading men, Chamberlain published his biography Shattered Love, in which, for the first time, he confirmed he was gay.",
      "Despite a relationship of more than 30 years with the actor and director Martin Rabbett, with whom he'd once starred in the film Allan Quatermain and the Lost City of Gold, they had kept their private life private.",
      "\"I thought there was something very, very deeply wrong with me,\" he said, \"and I wanted to cover it up. I remember making a pact with myself that I would never, ever reveal this secret, ever.\"",
      "Chamberlain and Rabbett went their separate ways in 2010.",
      "In later years, Chamberlain was happy to play a gay man, notably in Desperate Housewives and Will & Grace.",
      "He continued to perform in musical theatre, including touring productions of Spamalot, My Fair Lady and The Sound of Music.",
      "But he never regretted hiding his sexuality to protect his career.",
      "\"I would have been a happier person being out of the closet and being free,\" he told El Pais in 2024. \"But I had other motives that made me happy. I was a working actor and for me, that was most important.\"",
      "He will be remembered as the king of the TV mini-series: the dashing leading man in everything from Dr Kildare to The Thorn Birds.",
      "Despite attempts to reinvent himself as a serious stage actor, he was at his best on the small screen, entertaining millions watching at home on the sofa.",
      "For, although there were always better actors than Richard Chamberlain, few rivalled his ability to hold a television audience."

    "story": [
      "Alex Warren is on top of the world.",
      "Ordinary, a song he wrote for his wife Kouvr after their wedding last year, is at number one in six different countries.",
      "He has two more songs in the UK Top 40, and his UK tour has been upgraded to 5,000-capacity venues, due to insatiable demand.",
      "Backstage at the Hammersmith Apollo, the Californian singer is endearingly, humbly bewildered by the whole thing.",
      "\"All of this is happening really quickly,\" he says. \"I only wrote Ordinary three months ago. I'm honestly blown away.\"",
      "But the 24-year-old didn't arrive out of nowhere.",
      "He's one of the founders of the Hype House \u2013 a collaborative TikTok group who lived and worked together in the Los Angeles hills and shepherded millions of teenagers though the pandemic.",
      "You could easily dismiss him as yet another social media influencer trying to break into the music industry. It's an accusation he's aware of, and prepared for.",
      "\"I watched a lot of people, a lot of TikTokkers, make music and there was no meaning behind it. It was just something they decided to do,\" he says.",
      "\"But I wanted to write about real things. No one else can sing my songs. I don't take other people's demos. This is all mine.\"",
      "Even a passing glance at his discography proves him right.",
      "Warren's arena pop anthems are searingly honest, almost to a fault, drawing on his challenging childhood, and fairytale romance with Kouvr.",
      "His father died when he was nine years old, after a long struggle with kidney cancer. The loss sent his mother spiralling into alcoholism, something Warren only realised when he tried to clear up one of her coffee mugs.",
      "\"It turned out to be alcohol,\" he says. \"And the next day it was alcohol, and the next day it was alcohol, and at 4am it was alcohol, and when we were driving, it was alcohol.\"",
      "When he called her out on it, the addiction turned to abuse.",
      "\"Every person struggling with addiction needs someone to blame it on, besides themselves, and I became that person,\" he says.",
      "When he was 18, she kicked him out. He was broke and homeless. Friends let him sleep in their cars \u2013 never their houses, because his mum had convinced their parents he was a trouble-maker.",
      "Around the same time, he was introduced to Instagram model Kouvr Annon by a friend on Snapchat.",
      "\"We just clicked right away,\" he says. \"I felt I could tell her everything, just after our first conversation.\"",
      "Within four months, Kouvr left her family in Hawaii, flew out to California and started living with Warren in a car.",
      "Then, as now, they're an exceptionally cute couple \u2013 tender and funny and clearly besotted with one another. When they started posting videos of their romance online, people wanted to see more. In a span of six months, Warren gained more than a million followers on YouTube.",
      "Combined with the prank videos he'd filmed with his friends, he built a big enough audience to start earning money.",
      "\"When I got my first cheque for $2,000 in a month, I was like, 'Holy cow, this is gonna change my life',\" he recalls.",
      "Some of that money went into the creation of the Hype House in 2019. Warren came up with the name, and moved into the property with Annon and a bunch of young internet stars like Addison Rae, Charlie D'Amelio, Chase Hudson and Thomas Petrou.",
      "The collective introduced themselves in December 2019 with a photoshoot that mimicked Backstreet Boys video for I Want It That Way.",
      "By the end of the day, the hashtag #hypehouse was trending, and the mansion quickly became an incubator for viral videos.",
      "The enterprise thrived during lockdown but, as individual members signed TV deals, or grew tired of the escalating demands for content, it started to fall apart. Warren and Annon left in 2022, citing a desire to \"move on to the next chapter in their lives\".",
      "Since then, rumours have swirled about behind-the-scenes drama at the house, with some members hinting at exploitation and mistreatment.",
      "\"There was falling out,\" Warren told the Zach Sang show in 2023. \"But a lot of us signed NDAs, so no-one's going to talk about it.\"",
      "He did, however, pour his frustrations into music.",
      "\"How do you sleep at night?\" he sings on the angst-ridden Burning Down, a song allegedly targeted at one of the Hype House's co-founders.",
      "\"It scars forever when someone you called your friend / Shows you the truth can be so cold.\"",
      "Warren says he never made money from the Hype House. What it did give him, however, was a built-in audience for his music.",
      "\"I think that's really rare,\" he says. \"Usually, when someone goes from social media to music, they lose that fan base.",
      "\"But I think a lot of people watched my YouTube videos because they were having a rough life and needed an escape. So when I started making music about my rough life, I think they identified with it even more.\"",
      "Warren dreamt of a music career long before he entered the Hype House. Back when TikTok was called Music.ally, he'd even created a burner account to share his songs.",
      "\"I didn't want to post on my main account, because I was terrified of failing,\" he explains.",
      "\"As a kid, people bullied me for singing and doing talent shows and dedicating songs to my fifth grade girlfriend, you know?",
      "\"So I posted on a random account I created, and I filmed myself singing on the toilet because I wanted to show I wasn't taking it seriously.",
      "\"And the next day, I woke up and had 10 million views.\"",
      "His first release was 2021's One More I Love You, a song he started when he was 13 years old and coming to terms with his father's death.",
      "\"I watched my sister go to a daddy-daughter dance without her dad, and that's when I realised, 'Oh, wait, my life is different',\" he recalls.",
      "\"I started mourning for the first time, and I didn't know how to process it, so I just went to the piano and played some chords. And that's kind of where I started learning how to write.\"",
      "Warren's outpouring of grief is powerful in its simplicity, but it has touched people in ways he couldn't have anticipated.",
      "\"The other day, a woman wanted me to sign a Heinz Beans t-shirt,\" he says. \"I giggled because I thought that was funny, then she turned it over, and it was the same t-shirt her son wore right before he died from cancer.",
      "\"One More I Love You was the song that she played at that funeral and the song she listened to help her get over it.\"",
      "\"I think that's the most powerful thing in the world.\"",
      "The musician, who was raised a Catholic, believes that healing moments like those are part of God's plan for him.",
      "\"Without all the loss, all the trauma, all the things in my life, I wouldn't have these songs. I wouldn't have the means to help the 5,000 people coming to the show tonight, I wouldn't be able to provide for my future family with my wife.",
      "\"And I think those are all things that are meant to happen, or can happen if I make the  right choices.",
      "\"You know, I could have chosen to get into drugs and be a bad person but I chose this path.",
      "\"It's the craziest thing.\""

      "It wasn't Emma's first experience of poor mental health - she'd spent her teens seeing doctors and receiving different antidepressants. No one had ever suggested she might have bipolar disorder.",
      "Experts have told the BBC how most people living with bipolar disorder in the UK are \"undertreated, undiagnosed and left to try and survive in a system that has failed them\".",
      "The majority who, like Emma, are eventually diagnosed with bipolar disorder, are incorrectly prescribed antidepressants initially, which may make their symptoms worse rather than better. Experts also say there is a lack of continuity of care from GPs through to psychiatrists.",
      "Their warning comes as data exclusively shared with the BBC suggests the cost of the condition in the UK is now an estimated \u00a39.6bn a year. That equates to more than \u00a3300 per taxpayer.",
      "This breakdown includes NHS costs, such as GP services, psychiatrist appointments and visits to A&E and hospital admissions. It also includes economic costs, such as lost days at work and the need for family and friends to take time off to provide informal care.",
      "But it does not include welfare payments for those out of work, or costs for police services dealing with people in crisis.",
      "'Common, complex and costly'",
      "\"This nearly \u00a310bn figure is actually quite conservative,\" says Prof Judit Simon, from the Medical University of Vienna, who worked with the BBC to generate the number.",
      "\"If this is a government that really wants to try and bring down the welfare bill, then bipolar disorder should be its absolute priority, the target disorder to actually move the dial.\"",
      "The data suggests up to 372,000 people with bipolar disorder are currently out of work, with some claiming benefits in the UK.",
      "For a treatable disease, this number could be slashed if the correct care was on offer, say experts.",
      "Prof Guy Goodwin, emeritus professor of psychiatry at University of Oxford, says: \"If you want to cut the costs of a disease, you need to reduce hospital admissions and emergency care. If you don't focus on cutting hospital admissions then you waste money.\"",
      "According to the Royal College of Psychiatrists (RCPsych), bipolar disorder is a manageable condition.",
      "Dr Trudi Seneviratne, registrar at the RCPsych and a commissioner on the Bipolar Commission, says it is \"completely treatable\" with a combination of medication, talking therapies and lifestyle factors.",
      "\"But there are many, many people who are suffering in silence with lower levels of symptoms because there isn't a good clinical care pathway for them in the UK.\"",
      "She says if care for bipolar disorder was fit for purpose, it would cut \"the cost to society\" as well as reducing \"the human suffering this disease unnecessarily causes\".",
      "It is this sense of waste - with people who could be leading a good life but aren't - that angers experts most, who say it is a neglected diagnosis.",
      "Prof Allan Young, from Imperial College, says: \"Bipolar is common, complex and costly - but it is so often unrecognised.",
      "\"People know it is there but somehow people are just not being cared for correctly.\"",
      "This lack of correct care is what Rosie says resulted in her being arrested at Stansted Airport for jumping the security barriers during a manic episode in her early 20s.",
      "\"I was utterly delusional,\" she says. Following her arrest, Rosie was taken to A&E and locked in a room. She waited there for more than 12 hours while a bed at a specialist mental health unit was found.",
      "Like Emma, Rosie had been dealing with mental health issues since childhood, but it was only after being in crisis that her condition was recognised. This particular period of psychotic mania had been triggered by a relationship breakdown.",
      "She was sectioned and hospitalised for three months, after which she finally began finding a combination of medications that worked for her.",
      "Now 29, Rosie says she still has high and low periods, but adds that she is far more stable and is able to work part time.",
      "\"I was failed,\" she says. \"I'm told my symptoms were a textbook case for bipolar lows and highs \u2013 energetic, grandiose language, erratic \u2013 but no one even considered this diagnosis for me until I was sectioned.\"",
      "Costs could be halved",
      "The Maudsley Hospital, in South London, has an intensive specialist care programme for its sickest, most regularly relapsing bipolar patients. The service aims to try and stop patients hitting crisis point.",
      "Similar to services offered in other European nations, the hospital provides group sessions for patients and their families. The classes help patients to understand when an episode might be starting and then contact the service once they spot early warning signs.",
      "They can then attend an outpatient clinic and adjust medications. The relatively cheap programme has seen re-admission rates to hospital fall by 80% as intervention takes place before a crisis.",
      "Prof Young says costs associated with bipolar disorder could be halved with more specialist care programmes.",
      "\"Undoubtedly, specialist treatment could contribute to getting lots of people back into work. And we know that work is very good for helping people recover from episodes of mental ill health.\"",
      "However, many experts say patients still face a postcode lottery about whether they can see a psychiatrist at all.",
      "Carolyn Chew-Graham, a GP and professor of general practice research at Keele University, says those who are acutely unwell will be picked up quickly by crisis teams but those with \"less florid manic episodes\" can miss out on referral to specialists for diagnosis.",
      "\"There's a high threshold of referral,\" Prof Chew Graham says. \"People really have to be quite unwell before they are seen in specialist services\". She says GPs may be reluctant to refer patients - even if they strongly suspect they have bipolar disorder - for fear they will be rejected.",
      "\"GPs may think I won't even consider bipolar because if I mention it to the patient and then I can't get them seen, I am a bit stuck\".",
      "Prof Young says bipolar patients need long-term specialist care.",
      "\"But that's the frustration here - even though there is strong evidence that specialist care improves the outcomes for the patient, and costs the state less, there are still so few bipolar specialist facilities.",
      "\"It's a tragedy.\"",
      "An NHS spokesperson said bipolar disorder could often take time to diagnose because it affected everyone differently and the symptoms were similar to other mental health conditions.",
      "\"NHS staff are working incredibly hard to get people diagnosed and reduce waiting times for care.",
      "\"Staff are treating a million more people than they were six years ago and are working to transform services alongside this demand \u2013 this includes strengthening community services, trialling new 24/7 open access mental health centres and rolling out mental health crisis lines.\"",

      "And all this as they are expected to help more patients with some conditions to take the pressure off GPs.",
      "Government funding for pharmacies in England stood at \u00a32.6bn in 2019/20. But over the next few years that did not go up with inflation.",
      "In the current financial year (2024/25) it has been at \u00a32.7bn.",
      "The government has now announced a new deal for pharmacies in England, which will see funding rise to \u00a33.1bn next year (2025/26).",

      "And the deal includes a plan \u2013 announced on Sunday \u2013 to enable women to get the morning-after pill for free from pharmacies.",
      "As part of the deal, the government will also write off \u00a3193 million of debt for community pharmacy owners.",

      "Community pharmacies in England are \"on life support\", she said, adding the rise in National Insurance and business rates makes the situation \"even more acute\".",
      "Another community pharmacy group, the National Pharmacy Association (NPA), had announced that protest action would begin on Tuesday.",
      "It had previously warned that pharmacists were facing a \"financial cliff edge\" from 1 April, when many of their costs are due to rise.",
      "The NPA advised about 6,000 members in England to start \"working to rule\" from this date.",
      "This was due to involve cutting opening hours to around 40 hours a week \u2013 the minimum required under their contracts \u2013 and would have meant possible weekend closures.",
      "But the organisation says that this will be delayed while it consults members on the new deal.",

      "A total of 27 people have been referred to other services, including housing, by staff.",
      "The service, which follows similar programmes in 18 other countries, seeks to reduce drug-related harm in a hardcore population of injecting users in one of the most deprived communities in Glasgow.",
      "It is hoped that by providing a safer space it will allow medical staff to prevent overdose deaths, reduce blood-borne viruses and clean-up a local area that, historically, has had a major issue with discarded needles and drug debris.",
      "David Clark has been using drugs for 26 years and has spent long periods of his life on the streets.",
      "He allowed BBC Scotland to follow his progress over a three-month period as he attempted to move on from a city centre hostel and stop using heroin and cocaine.",

      "\"People that are eating unhealthy food or smoking, they know that what they're doing could harm their body, whereas if you're putting braids in your hair, you're not thinking that it's harming you.\"",
      "James Rogers, the head of product safety testing at Consumer Reports, says that the results are a cause for concern because women have \"constant contact\" with harmful chemicals if their hair is in braids, often for months at a time.",
      "\"We believe that whenever you're exposed to harmful chemicals, that it's cumulative - it all adds up.\"",
      "But he also emphasised that more research was needed, saying: \"We're hoping that this begins the conversation, not only at the regulatory level, but also amongst our own communities, about sharing accurate information.\"",
      "Here at Jos\u00e9e's Professional Braiding Studio in north London, the study certainly isn't putting clients off.",
      "Jos\u00e9e and her daughters Abigail and Naomi, who work with her in the salon, have seen interest from new customers, especially after they helped to create the wig worn by Elphaba in Wicked, one of highest-grossing movies of 2024.",
      "\"People were shocked by how versatile we can be with our braiding,\" Abigail tells me, adding that her mum received several messages from clients telling them how proud they were.",
      "Jos\u00e9e says that while the findings are \"worrying\", it has been business as usual at the salon.",
      "Some of her customers, however, have been rattled by the research.",
      "It's Kellie-Ann's first time getting her braids done at Jos\u00e9e's salon, but she has been wearing the style since she was a child.",
      "She tells me she felt betrayed after reading the study: \"I think it's awful that companies have been doing this for years to black women and I think we deserve better.\"",
      "She's now seeking out brands free from harmful chemicals and plastic - and says many of her friends are doing the same.",
      "\"A lot of women I've spoken to about it have agreed that biogradable would be better - it's good for the planet as well.\"",
      "Ifeanyi has also worn braids since childhood, and says they are the easiest and most convenient style to handle while she's busy studying at university.",
      "She argues that the study is not alarming, pointing out that people may come into contact with carcinogens every day, in certain processed foods, alcohol and tobacco.",
      "\"Obviously you want be cautious - I just think that it's not necessarily something to completely abandon the style or the hair for.\"",
      "She's concerned that the social media posts she has seen will \"scare people out of wanting to engage\", to the detriment of a critical source of income for black entrepreneurs working in the hair industry.",
      "In 2021 Treasure Tress, a UK-based beauty subscription for black hair, found that black British women spent \u00a3168m a year on hair products. Earlier research by L'Oreal suggested that black women in the UK spend six times more on their hair than white women.",
      "\"I'd like to see more of a commitment to making sure that things are safer for us, rather than telling us that some of our historical, traditional practices as black women are wrong,\" Ifeanyi says.",
      "For some, changing attitudes towards synthetic hair are opening up business opportunities.",
      "Tendai Moyo co-founded Ruka Hair in 2021, which specialises in extensions made from natural hair sourced from South East Asia, as well as biodegradable synthetic hair, made from collagen fibre.",
      "She tells me they have seen a \"huge uptick in demand\", especially in the US, where the study was published.",
      "But she sees this as part of a wider trend, which stretches beyond concerns raised by the new research.",
      "\"We launched in the pandemic, and people were like, 'Oh, but salons are closed', but we were selling out because people don't stop doing their hair.\"",
      "She tells me that black women \"got to experiment\" more with their hair during lockdown and were more willing to try out new products.",
      "One of the biggest draws of traditional synthetic hair brands, however, is their low price, which has made experimenting with different styles and colours affordable for years.",
      "But newer brands tend to have a higher price point - Tendai tells me that Ruka's most popular synthetic hair type costs around 2.5 times more than several high street brands.",
      "Ifeanyi says that, as a student, brands like Ruka are out of reach for her: \"To purchase the hair is equivalent to the amount it would cost you to get the hairstyle done, so you're essentially doubling the price.\"",
      "Tendai defends this by comparing it to choosing between \"fast food and healthy food\".",
      "She adds: \"You can actually reuse our products if you'd like, and therefore you're saving money in that way.\"",
      "Back at Jos\u00e9e's salon, Naomi tells me that braiding is not just an important source of income, but a valued cultural practice that brings her family together.",
      "\"I call myself a braid baby because I've been braiding since I was 6 years old,\" she says, telling me how her family would bond over the skill as her mum proudly looks on.",
      "\"It's an empowering service to offer,\" she adds, saying that it's gratifying to do a job that leaves other women feeling uplifted.",
      "Despite growing concerns about the effect it could have on our health, braiding is a precious heirloom for this family - and for many other black women - passed down from generation to generation.",

      "Between 2020 and 2022, the DCMS gave \u00a3474m to bodies in the sport and culture sectors to help them to survive lockdown, \u00a3218m was to sporting bodies with \u00a3124m supporting Premiership rugby union clubs.",
      "But the cross-party PAC, which assesses value for taxpayers' money, says \u00a3400m is yet to be paid back, and less than half of borrowers had started repayments.",
      "Nine bodies, which had collectively received \u00a346m, have become insolvent.",
      "That includes three rugby clubs - London Irish, Wasps and Worcester - with the DCMS saying it does not expect to recover up to \u00a329m of the \u00a341m it lent to them.",
      "Amid concerns over the finances of the remaining top-flight teams, the MPs say that \"future repayment is put at risk by the department's need to maintain the financial viability of the sectors to which it has given loans\".",
      "The PAC warned of a \"gap in accountability to parliament\" over the money lent to rugby union, due to \"a conflict of interest\" involving a senior civil servant's connections with the sport.",
      "PAC chair Sir Geoffrey Clifton-Brown MP said it was \"right that government came forward with necessary support [but] not to provide a lifetime guarantee to institutions like rugby union which may be experiencing financial difficulties five years later\".",
      "\"DCMS is inherently conflicted in the management of its Covid loan-book,\" he said. \"As a lender, its priority will be to secure best value for the taxpayer from these loans. As a department, its priority is to do everything in its power to support a sector which has become its debtor.\"",
      "In a statement, the DCMS said: \"This government will always protect taxpayers' money and we are committed to recovering funds paid out under the previous administration. We have recovered 97% of repayments due and we are set to see all borrowers begin their repayments by later this year.",

      "Background",
      "Premiership rugby union clubs accounted for 57% (\u00a3124m) of the DCMS's total loans of \u00a3218m to sports bodies during the pandemic. Rugby league (\u00a324.2m), horse racing (\u00a321.5m) and tennis (\u00a314.3m) were the next highest beneficiaries, while non-league football clubs received \u00a313.4m.",
      "But with then-Premiership clubs London Irish, Wasps and Worcester all going out of business during the 2022-23 campaign, the taxpayer has been left out of pocket by tens of millions of pounds in unrecovered loans.",
      "\"DCMS insisted that these clubs were financially viable when it awarded the loans, despite public reports at the time to the contrary,\" said the PAC.",
      "Noting that some borrowers had been granted \"repayment holidays\" of up to four years, the PAC said that loans \"should not be extended to provide support for bodies which are financially unviable five years post-pandemic\".",
      "The report recommends that the DCMS \"should demonstrate a tough approach on behalf of taxpayers to managing those borrowers in trouble, including when considering any future additional financial support\".",
      "'Concerning and avoidable'",
      "Last month, government officials defended the loans to professional rugby union clubs.",
      "But with both Newcastle and Exeter both recently seeking investment, they also admitted being increasingly pessimistic over the financial stability of the club game.",
      "The last set of accounts filed by all Premiership clubs in 2022-23 showed that the sides collectively lost \u00a330.5m and have net debts of more than \u00a3300m, amid fears that the finances of elite club are unsustainable.",
      "The most senior DSMS civil servant - permanent secretary Susannah Storey - told the PAC that her department would use \"all financial levers\" to recover the money owed to it.",
      "However in its report, the PAC says that Storey has \"a conflict of interest regarding rugby union\", because her husband Pev Hooper is on the board of Premiership Rugby, and is also a director at CVC Capital Partners - a major investor in the sport.",
      "\"She has properly declared this conflict and recused herself from relevant discussions and decisions, and the department has put in place arrangements involving other staff to handle the conflict\", says the PAC.",
      "\"However, the department is most heavily exposed to rugby union in terms of both the amount of loans it has made and the financial health of the sport. The conflict of interest meant that we could not question the Permanent Secretary directly about the \u00a3124m that the department had loaned to top-tier rugby union clubs and its subsequent management of these loans.\"",
      "It adds that \"this gap in senior oversight and accountability for such a significant amount of public money is concerning and avoidable. It strikes this committee as odd that the department has not taken steps to address this such as by asking another Permanent Secretary to provide scrutiny and assurance\".",
      "The PAC published correspondence it had received from Storey in which she said that \"it is not accurate to state that there is a gap in accountability\" because relevant decision-making had been delegated to colleagues in line with guidelines.",
      "She also said that it was wrong to say the DCMS was \"overly optimistic\" about recouping all the funding because it had made clear that as it expected 14% of borrowers to fail over a 10-year period.",
      "'Inconsistent approach'",
      "The PAC also said the DCMS has shown \"an inconsistent approach to its engagement with professional sports.\"",
      "\"The department says it took a common approach when lending to borrowers in different sports, but, in our view, its subsequent actions display different approaches in practice,\" it said.",
      "\"It has appointed consultants and engaged with the Rugby Football Union, the Premier Rugby League and CVC Capital Partners on the future of rugby union.",
      "\"In contrast, the department was less certain about the extent of engagement by itself and Sport England with professional basketball over proposed structural changes to the game that could put at risk repayment of the last outstanding loans from four of the 11 professional clubs that received loans.",
      "\"When the department did provide us with more information, it was clear to us that it has been less engaged with basketball than with professional rugby union.\""

      "Labour has shown a willingness in recent weeks to look afresh at the role of arm's length bodies, announcing plans last month to completely abolish one body, NHS England, and return its powers to the health department.",
      "There is already a review of the sentencing system under way, led by former Conservative justice secretary David Gauke and aimed tackling prison overcrowding.",
      "It is not currently clear how the two reviews will interact.",
      "The guidelines were set to advise magistrates and judges to obtain a pre-sentence report - giving further details of an offender's background - before handing out punishment to someone of an ethnic or faith minority, alongside other groups such as young adults, abuse survivors and pregnant women.",
      "Conservative shadow justice secretary Robert Jenrick first raised concerns about the guidelines earlier this month, saying they were biased \"against straight white men\" and amounted to \"two-tier justice\".",
      "In response, Mahmood said she also opposed a \"two-tier sentencing approach\" and that she \"did not stand for any differential treatment before the law\".",
      "The Sentencing Council had argued the now-suspended guidelines, which had been in development for months, would ensure courts had the \"most comprehensive information available\" to hand out an appropriate sentence.",
      "This, the council said, could address disadvantages faced within the criminal justice system.",
      "Official figures show that offenders from ethnic minorities consistently get longer sentences than white offenders for indictable offences.",
      "'Preferential treatment'",
      "Updating MPs on Tuesday, Mahmood said: \"The proper role of the Sentencing Council and the process for making guidelines of this type must be considered further.",
      "\"I will do so in the coming months. It is right that this question is considered in greater depth,\" she said.",
      "She added that \"should further legislation be required,\" she would propose it as part of the government's planned Sentencing Bill.",
      "\"The Sentencing Council, while only 15 years old, holds an important position within the firmament of our justice system and any changes must be made carefully and with due consideration,\" she told MPs.",
      "Parliament \"must reverse\" the guidelines and reassert \"that no race or religion should receive preferential treatment before the law,\" she said.",
      "Mahmood will also pilot the Sentencing Guidelines (Pre-sentence reports) Bill through Parliament after it was published on Tuesday.",
      "If passed, the bill would prevent future sentencing guidelines about pre-sentence reports \"framed by reference to different personal characteristics of an offender\".",
      "'Lost control'",
      "Responding to the new review, Jenrick said Labour had \"completely lost control of the justice system\".",
      "The new bill would not \"tackle the root cause of the problem,\" Jenrick argued.",
      "He described the Sentencing Council as an \"activist\" quango, or quasi-autonomous non-governmental organisation, whose views were \"completely divergent to the public, to Parliament, and to the government.\"",
      "He called on the government to back his plan require ministerial approval of any future Sentencing Council guidelines.",
      "Veteran Labour MP Dianne Abbott said she was \"astonished\" that Mahmood thought judges could be swayed by \"guidelines in relation to how they sentence black and brown defendants\".",
      "\"Repeated statistical analysis has demonstrated what some of us consider to be unfairness in relation to black and brown people, and the criminal justice system,\" she said.",
      "Abbott also warned against ministers interfering with the courts.",

    "story": [
      "The UK is expecting to be hit by new US tariffs on Wednesday, with Downing Street indicating a deal to exempt British goods will not be reached in time.",
      "US President Donald Trump has said he plans to unveil a raft of new tariffs - or import taxes - on 2 April, on top of a 25% levy on car and car parts which has already been announced.",
      "Over the weekend he suggested the tariffs would hit all countries, not just those with the biggest trade imbalances with the US.",
      "The prime minister's official spokesman said talks on an economic deal between the two countries to avoid tariffs had been \"constructive\" but he did not rule out retaliating if they were imposed on the UK.",
      "\"When it comes to tariffs, the prime minister has been clear he will always act in the national interest and we've been preparing for all eventualities ahead of the announcement from President Trump, which we would expect the UK to be impacted by alongside other countries,\" he said.",
      "\"We are having constructive discussions on a US-UK economic prosperity deal but we will only do a deal which delivers economic prosperity for the British people and we will only act in the national interest.\"",
      "Pressed on whether the government was hopeful of a deal to avert tariffs being reached by Wednesday, the spokesman said discussions between the UK and the US \"will likely continue beyond Wednesday\".",
      "He said the UK would \"take a calm and pragmatic approach\" in response to any tariffs, arguing \"a trade war with the US is not in anybody's interests\".",
      "But he added: \"We rule nothing out in response.\"",
      "UK prepared to retaliate against US tariffs, No 10 sources say",
      "Global shares slide as Trump tariffs loom",
      "What are tariffs and why is Trump using them?",
      "Conservative shadow trade secretary Andrew Griffith MP said: \"This news is potentially a hammer blow not just to British businesses and workers but to [the PM's] own chancellor whose creative accounting at the emergency budget fails to include the impact of tariffs.",
      "\"Labour claims talks with the US are going \"well\". But, if this is what well looks like, I wouldn't like to see what the opposite looks like. The prime minister has so far failed to come up with the goods, he needs to rekindle our US trade deal.\"",
      "The Liberal Democrats have urged the government to hit back with its own tariffs, as Canada and the European Union have already done.",
      "The party's leader Sir Ed Davey said: \"Just asking nicely clearly doesn't work with Trump, so we have to stand tall with our allies in Canada and Europe and show that we will not be bullied.",
      "\"That means being prepared to impose reciprocal tariffs if necessary, including on Elon Musk's Teslas, and urgently negotiating a better trade deal with the EU to show Trump we have alternatives.\"",
      "It comes after Sir Keir Starmer spoke to Trump over the phone on Sunday, with Downing Street saying the pair had \"productive negotiations\" about an economic deal.",
      "The government has argued the UK has a relatively equal trading relationship with the US, compared to its other partners.",
      "The independent Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) has warned a reciprocal trade war would wipe billions off economic growth and all but eliminate the headroom Chancellor Rachel Reeves has to stay within her self-imposed rules on spending and borrowing.",
      "This could lead to further tax rises or spending cuts if she wanted to avoid breaking her fiscal rules.",
      "The OBR's latest economic forecast, published on Wednesday, said GDP would be 0.6% lower than forecast this year and 1% lower next year in the most \"severe\" scenario, in which the UK and other nations retaliated to Trump's tariffs.",
      "In an alternative scenario where the UK does not retaliate, the OBR has forecast a smaller reduction in growth, with GDP 0.4% lower than expected this year and 0.6% lower next year.",
      "It is unclear how the UK would retaliate if tariffs do come into effect. There are a range of options available, from duties on sectors where British products are particularly important to the US, to focusing on specific products like Harley Davidson motorcycles.",
      "UK car exports are worth about \u00a37.6bn per year, and the US is the second largest market for UK cars after the European Union, according to car industry body the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT).",
      "Trump's plan is expected a to hit British luxury car makers such as Rolls-Royce and Aston Martin.",
      "The US president argues his measures will help American manufacturers and protect jobs, despite warnings prices could go up for consumers.",
      "During a meeting between the prime minister and president at the White House last month, Trump hinted at \"a real trade deal\", which could see the UK avoid the kind of tariffs he has been threatening other countries with.",
      "What impact could tariffs have on the UK?",
      "by Dharshini David, deputy economics editor",
      "The impact of a US tariff on all British goods is very uncertain. It depends on not just on the scale of any tariffs applied on British products, but how the government, businesses and consumers react.",
      "As the car industry knows already, tariffs are extremely worrying for the industries affected - as an exporter you hope that either some of it can be soaked up in the supply chain or your American customers will be happy to pay higher prices - or you take a hit to your own profits by lowering prices.",
      "Or you may lose sales, tariffs are undeniably bad news for exporters in the firing line.",
      "But their impact on prices in the UK is uncertain. If the UK government retaliates with tariffs on American products, households here could face rises. But countries such as China, if disadvantaged by American tariffs, could try to send their goods here instead, pushing down prices.",
      "Broadly, US tariffs would be detrimental to UK growth. Without retaliatory tariffs, the UK's official forecasters reckon that 0.6% could be knocked off UK growth next year - unhelpful but not disastrous. Underpinning that scenario is a number of assumptions.",
      "But, as it cautions, there are so many uncertainties about not just the policy, but how it would filter through."

    "story": [
      "A major incident has been declared by Birmingham City Council over the ongoing bin strike, which has left 17,000 tonnes of waste on the streets.",
      "Leader John Cotton said it was in response to concerns for public health as the authority struggles to clear the rubbish, which has led to the issue being raised in Parliament.",
      "Its declaration means the council can increase its street cleaning operation and fly-tipping removal, by bringing in an extra 35 vehicles and crews.",
      "Unite union members have been on all-out strike since 11 March in a row over pay, and over this latest move bosses accused the council of being \"hellbent on imposing\" its plan for salary cuts and demotions.",
      "Residents in many areas of the city say they have had enough of seeing mountains of rubbish piling up, and are asking questions as to why some areas are apparently seeing bins being emptied while others are not.",
      "As the strike was being raised in the House of Commons, the government said it was \"monitoring the situation closely\".",
      "Mr Cotton said a lot of the difficulty in clearing the waste in the streets had been caused by staff on picket lines who, he said, were preventing vehicles from getting out of depot.",
      "It was \"regrettable\" the council had to take this step, Mr Cotton said.",
      "\"[But] we cannot tolerate a situation that is causing harm and distress to communities across Birmingham,\" he said.",
      "\"I respect the right to strike and protest, however actions on the picket line must be lawful and sadly the behaviour of some now means we are seeing a significant impact on residents and the city's environment.",
      "\"Unless we declare a major incident and deploy the waste service's contingency plan, then we would be unable to clear the backlog of waste on the streets.\"",
      "Declaring the major incident also allows the Labour-run council to \"work with partners to better manage the risks the city is facing\", which could include increased sharing of data.",

      "Speaking in the House of Commons, local government minister Jim McMahon said \"well-established arrangements\" were in place in the city.",
      "\"If local leaders on the ground in Birmingham feel that tackling these issues goes beyond the resources available to them and they request national support, then of course we stand ready to respond,\" he said.",
      "\"This government will always back local leaders and give them the support that they need.\"",
      "However, Kevin Hollinrake, shadow local government secretary, accused the Labour government of being in \"total denial\" and said declaring a major incident was not enough.",
      "The move came after the Conservatives wrote to ministers to hold urgent talks and send in \"strike-busting private rubbish collectors to help clean up the rat-infested rubbish covered streets\".",
      "Negotiations between the council and Unite were held on Thursday but broke down, with the authority saying all offers on the table had been rejected.",
      "In response, the council said it had launched a period of collective consultation regarding compulsory redundancies.",
      "Unite claims planned restructuring of the refuse service will see some 50 workers lose \u00a38,000 a year, and about 20 lose \u00a32,000 per annum.",
      "Sharon Graham, its general secretary, said that instead of declaring a major incident, the authority could easily resolve the dispute but instead was \"hellbent on imposing its plan of demotions and pay cuts at all costs\".",
      "\"We can only conclude that this massive pay cut for hundreds of refuse workers is only the start and this is really about stamping out any future opposition to its plans to unleash austerity 2.0 on Birmingham,\" Ms Graham said.",

      "The government has agreed a new funding package with pharmacy negotiators in England, leading some pharmacies to call off protests that were planned for later this week.",
      "One group representing thousands of local pharmacies was preparing to take action involving cuts to opening hours from Tuesday, but they say that will be delayed while they consider the deal.",
      "Others have said the funding package is a \"step in the right direction\" but it still will not cover all cost increases pharmacies are facing, including a rise in National Insurance.",
      "Announcing the deal, ministers said they were working to turn around a \"decade of underfunding and neglect\".",
      "Community pharmacies have been warning of closures and cutbacks in the face of what they say are unsustainable pressures.",
      "Among these are a rising workload, funding which has not kept pace with inflation and the prospect of higher employer National Insurance contributions.",
      "And all this as they are expected to help more patients with some conditions to take the pressure off GPs.",
      "Government funding for pharmacies in England stood at \u00a32.6bn in 2019/20. But over the next few years that did not go up with inflation.",
      "In the current financial year (2024/25) it has been at \u00a32.7bn.",
      "The government has now announced a new deal for pharmacies in England, which will see funding rise to \u00a33.1bn next year (2025/26).",
      "The deal will also include more mental health support for patients and increased consultations and blood pressure checks.",
      "And the deal includes a plan \u2013 announced on Sunday \u2013 to enable women to get the morning-after pill for free from pharmacies.",
      "As part of the deal, the government will also write off \u00a3193 million of debt for community pharmacy owners.",
      "Health Minister Stephen Kinnock said: \"We're working to turn around a decade of underfunding and neglect that has left the sector on the brink of collapse.",
      "\"This package of record investment and reform is a vital first step to getting community pharmacies back on their feet and fit for the future.\"",
      "There was a cautious welcome from representatives of High Street chemists but warnings that the extra funding would not be enough to cover rising costs.",
      "Leyla Hannbeck, chief executive of the Independent Pharmacies Association, said the government's announcement was a \"welcome step in the right direction\" but it \"does not alleviate pressures and will not stop closures\".",
      "Community pharmacies in England are \"on life support\", she said, adding the rise in National Insurance and business rates makes the situation \"even more acute\".",
      "Another community pharmacy group, the National Pharmacy Association (NPA), had announced that protest action would begin on Tuesday.",
      "It had previously warned that pharmacists were facing a \"financial cliff edge\" from 1 April, when many of their costs are due to rise.",
      "The NPA advised about 6,000 members in England to start \"working to rule\" from this date.",
      "This was due to involve cutting opening hours to around 40 hours a week \u2013 the minimum required under their contracts \u2013 and would have meant possible weekend closures.",
      "But the organisation says that this will be delayed while it consults members on the new deal.",
      "NPA chair Nick Kaye said Monday's announcement was a \"step forward\".",
      "\"However, the truth is that because of a decade of neglect it also falls a long way short of the NHS's own estimates of the true cost of providing pharmacy services,\" he added.",

    "story": [
      "Sir Keir Starmer's communications chief has resigned after nine months in Downing Street.",
      "Labour veteran Matthew Doyle, who worked for Tony Blair, was brought in as Sir Keir's communications director four years ago, when the party was in opposition.",
      "He is the second senior member of Sir Keir's team to leave less than a year after the general election, following Sue Gray walking out of the door as his chief of staff in the autumn.",
      "Mr Doyle's departure is expected to lead to the promotions of James Lyons to director of communications (strategy) and Steph Driver to director of communications (delivery).",
      "Sue Gray quits as Sir Keir Starmer's chief of staff",
      "Dodds exit shows unease over Starmer's tough decisions",
      "Mr Doyle's decision to quit and leave immediately has caused some surprise, but one special adviser said he \"had been increasingly detached for some time. It was clear that Lyons was actually in charge - and doing an excellent job to be fair\".",
      "The veteran spin doctor has more than a quarter of a century of experience with Labour, beginning as the head of press for the party in 1998, before a brief stint as an adviser to David Blunkett, then the work and pensions secretary.",
      "Moving into Blair's No 10 in 2005, Mr Doyle rose to become deputy head of communications, and carried on working for Blair after he left office for another five years.",
      "He spent a period working at the charity International Rescue with David Miliband, the former Blair-era foreign secretary, and set up his own consultancy.",
      "Mr Doyle joined Sir Keir Starmer's team in the summer of 2021, arguably the lowest point of his leadership, shortly after a humiliating defeat for Labour in a by-election in Hartlepool.",
      "An email from Mr Doyle to colleagues this morning, seen by the BBC, said \"it's time to pass the baton on\".",
      "He added: \"I wanted to let you know that I have informed the prime minister I am standing down as director of communications.",

      "'Away day'",
      "In a statement, Sir Keir said: \"Matthew brought his considerable experience to my team in summer 2021 and has worked tirelessly by my side every day since playing a leading role in Labour's historic election win.",
      "\"On a personal level it has been a real privilege to work with him and on behalf of the entire team I wish him all the very best for his next role.\"",
      "Special advisers from across government are gathering for an away day today, at which new arrangements for Labour's communications team will be discussed.",
      "Mr Doyle's role is expected to be split between Ms Driver, who is Downing Street's current deputy communications director, and Mr Lyons, a former political journalist and TikTok spinner who joined Number 10 last year.",
      "Ms Driver will focus on day-to-day interactions with journalists, with Mr Lyons' attention on managing the grid of forthcoming government announcements.",

    "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2gey6pvddo",
    "published": "Fri, 28 Mar 2025 00:00:13 GMT",
    "summary": "Why the reign of the free market is facing its biggest ever challenge",
    "story": [
      "I remember 1974 well. With inflation on the rise, the government had been locked in battle with trade unions over worker pay. The government appeared paralysed: stand up to the miners and strikes could shut down the power system, but give in and pay them more money and inflation would rocket.",
      "And then the global oil crisis came out of nowhere. It threw economies, including Britain's, into chaos. The government introduced a three-day week. Power cuts were common - we would be plunged into darkness without warning. And seemingly, the government just expected us to deal with it.",
      "This was also the year I began presenting the BBC's current affairs programme Panorama. We spent a lot of time debating these issues. People came on with all kinds of different ideas of what to do.",
      "There were even suggestions that what the country really needed to take back control from the unions was a military takeover - a coup.",
      "There was another idea out there too. It was proposed by the Conservative politician Keith Joseph and was entirely radical - so removed from the mainstream, in fact, that during filming of Panorama, Joseph turned to the production team and asked exasperatedly if they understood what he meant.",
      "That idea was the free market.",
      "This meant Britain departing from the post World War Two consensus that government should control the economy and that instead if you left the markets alone, they would deliver the country greater prosperity and security.",
      "If, in 2025, the idea sounds anything but radical, that's exactly the point.",
      "What we saw in the UK in the 1980s under Margaret Thatcher's government was just how quickly the free market transitioned from a radical idea into the new reality. Then before long it became what many assumed was the system that would last forever.",
      "US President Donald Trump is a billionaire businessman who has clearly done well financially out of capitalism. But suddenly, thanks in part to him, the free market system finds itself under assault like never before.",
      "It might yet weather the storm. However others are asking, is the free market system fatally flawed and doomed to failure?",
      "The fantasy world of Thatcher's Britain",
      "So much of what Thatcher did in the wake of her 1983 general election victory seems so obvious now. We take it for granted that private companies play a pivotal role in providing our water, electricity, gas, railways, ports and freight.",
      "But at the time few believed it possible to do what she had done - it seemed like a fantasy world, completely detached from how things had been done post war.",
      "I was six when the war ended. There was rationing \u2013 coupons that allowed you to buy meat or clothes, or of course, sweets. But out of these hard times and on the heels of victory, a new vision of society was emerging in Britain.",
      "With Clement Attlee's landslide election victory in July 1945, for the first time in Britain's political history a majority cast their votes for a party ostensibly dedicated to socialism.",
      "But more than that, a new consensus on how the country should run emerged, with those leading the Labour and Conservative parties singing from a broadly similar sheet.",
      "\"We have built our defences against want and sickness, and we're proud of it,\" was uttered not by a Labour prime minister but by Harold Macmillan, Conservative prime minister from 1957 to 1963. This had been how things were done.",
      "However not everyone bought into the consensus. Antony Fisher, who was a chicken farmer, was exasperated by what he saw as the meddling of the Egg Marketing Board. He set up the Institute of Economic Affairs think tank, inspired Keith Joseph and he in turn got Thatcher's ear.",
      "Trump's admiration of Thatcher",
      "That the current assault on the free market is coming, in part, from a Republican US president seems all the more ironic given how popular Thatcher's reforms were with the American right.",
      "Thatcher and President Ronald Reagan shared a similar world view, and Trump has spoken of his admiration for the two, albeit with the caveat that he didn't agree with some of Reagan's trade policies.",
      "Thatcher was convinced that the country would be much better off if gas and water and electricity were taken out of the hands of the state. And sold on the open market. The free market. Just like buying a loaf of bread.",
      "The Thatcher government's big idea was that they weren't just going to sell the shares in state-owned utilities to big businesses or investors. They were going to offer them to the British people.",
      "In December 1984 shares in British Telecom (BT) went on sale. The next morning, the numbers were staggering: more than two million Britons were now BT shareholders.",
      "And Thatcher began to realise that selling off these companies wasn't just about breaking the shackles of government control. It could be something bigger - turning every person in Britain into a capitalist and in doing so making capitalism popular.",
      "In Britain, by the end of the 1980s, the scale of transformation was staggering. The sum of \u00a360bn was raised by selling off state run companies. Up to 15 million Britons were now shareholders.",
      "Britain was embracing the free market. This wasn't just an economic shift. It was a cultural revolution. A redefinition of Britain's relationship with money, with government, and with itself.",
      "And if Thatcher's privatisation had given ordinary people the chance to buy shares, her reforms to Britain's financial services sector in 1986, known as the Big Bang, gave ordinary people the chance to sell them too, to get a job in the previously closed world of the City.",
      "There were many on the left for whom the principle alone of these reforms was something to object to. The assault on the free market from some on the right is not about the principles of the reforms, but the consequences.",
      "Offshore business and collapsing communities",
      "At the core of Thatcher's thinking was a belief that free market capitalism could work only if many people had a direct stake in it. And with share ownership of previously state run utilities, many people did. But before long, alarm bells were starting to be rung. And their chime has only gotten louder.",
      "James Goldsmith was a businessman who had made a fortune by buying struggling companies cheaply, reshaping them to maximise efficiency and then selling them at a profit. The 1980s reforms were like manna from heaven for him.",
      "But then he seemed to change his mind about things. In 1994 he told a committee of US senators that its premise contained a fatal flaw - that the system demanded maximum profit but to achieve maximum profit that meant severing the umbilical link with many of your own electorate.",
      "\"You get to a system whereby, to get the best corporate profits, you have to leave your own country. You have to say to your own sales force 'Goodbye, we can't use you anymore - you're too expensive'.",
      "\"You've got unions. You want holidays. You want protection. So we're going offshore.\"",
      "Goldsmith was predicting that companies would take their business wherever they would make the most money. If you are a CEO answerable to shareholders that's literally your job description. And the result, he said, would be job losses in the West, with communities collapsing.",
      "And to make things worse, he argued that Britain had ceded sovereignty to the likes of the European Union and the World Trade Organization, with Britain binding itself to an economic system run by unelected bureaucrats in Brussels, only adding to the sense of alienation felt in collapsing communities. And with global markets dictating policy. If an industry wasn't profitable, it was left to die.",
      "Today, the UK may be a global leader in science and financial services but is that of much consolation to communities where we once made things that are now made offshore?",
      "Based on what I often heard in my many years touring the country presenting Question Time, I'm not sure it is.",
      "Goldsmith would end up trying to go into politics. His Referendum Party was trounced in the 1997 general election but he had planted a seed. He had argued that the global free market path that Britain and the rest of the world was going down was dangerous. That it would spread division around the world.",
      "Fast-forward nearly 20 years to 2016 and his warning came to pass. Britain voted to leave the European Union and the verdict could not be clearer: the Leave vote was highest in those left-behind communities, seemingly fuelled by those who felt globalisation was not working for them.",
      "The dream of a nation of shareholders has soured too.",
      "In 1989 Thames Water was privatised. We were promised lower bills, better infrastructure, less red tape and investment in a system fraying at the edges. It was investment that the global capitalist system was supposedly best placed to provide.",
      "What followed was something else entirely. Debt ballooned and dividends flowed to shareholders. The company extracted profit while pipes leaked and sewage poured into rivers. And our bills now pay for interest on that debt - it feels like we've come a long way from Thatcher's nation of shareholders.",
      "Trump's tariffs 'defy easy explanation'",
      "Back in 1994, James Goldsmith had posited that the problem with the free market dream was that it didn't protect the home base.",
      "Now, there is someone else much more powerful who takes that view.",
      "President Trump's methods are so erratic that with him it's hard to tell what is going on. His readiness to slap hugely consequential tariffs on countries that are both traditional foes and supposed friends at times defies easy explanation.",
      "But what we can say is that he is trying to return to ideas that preceded the free market. He is trying to make America strong through protectionism, making it harder for anyone to simply sell anywhere.",
      "There is an argument that if you take the long view then perhaps the free market period is the outlier. Britain itself had a long, long period of protectionism before it embraced free trade.",
      "Tariffs are nothing new in world economic history and in a sense Trump is just trying to return the US to how things were, albeit in quite a chaotic way.",
      "The reign of the free market is facing its biggest ever challenge. But that challenge is coming not from supporters of socialism who ideologically back a big role for the state. Instead, the challenge is coming from Trump, a man who is broadly speaking of the right and has no qualms with capitalism allowing people to become very rich.",

      "Dr Richard Fox, head of science at Butterfly Conservation, said he was \"devastated\" by the apparent decline, and it had been brought about by human actions.",
      "The scheme has asked volunteers to count butterflies across the country since 1976 and monitors more than 3,000 sites.",
      "\"We have destroyed wildlife habitats, polluted the environment, used pesticides on an industrial scale and we are changing the climate,\" Dr Fox said.",

    "story": [
      "The Environment Agency (EA) has launched a comprehensive review into shipments of waste tyres from the UK to India.",
      "Last week, BBC File on 4 Investigates heard that millions of these tyres - sent for recycling - were actually being \"cooked\" in makeshift furnaces, causing serious health problems and environmental damage.",
      "The pressure group Fighting Dirty has threatened legal proceedings against the EA over what it called a \"lack of action\" over the issue of tyre exports.",
      "The EA has asked the group to wait until its own review is complete, and it has also asked File on 4 Investigates to share the evidence from its investigation.",
      "The UK generates about 50 million waste tyres (nearly 700,000 tonnes) every year. According to official figures, about half of these are exported to India, supposedly to be recycled.",
      "But BBC File on 4 Investigates revealed that some 70% of tyres exported to India from the UK and the rest of the world are being sent to makeshift industrial plants, where they are \"cooked\" in order to extract steel, small amounts of oil as well as carbon black - a powder or pellet that can be used in various industries.",
      "Conditions at these plants - many of which are in rural backwaters - can be toxic and harmful to public health, as well as potentially dangerous.",
      "In January, two women and two children were killed in an explosion at a plant in the western state of Maharashtra, where European-sourced tyres were being processed.",
      "A BBC team visited the site and saw soot, dying vegetation and polluted waterways around. Villagers complained of persistent coughs and eye problems.",
      "Following the broadcast, the Department for the Environment, Food & Rural Affairs (Defra) told BBC File on 4 Investigates that officials and lawyers within the EA were \"very keen\" to investigate the claims made in the programme, including any potential criminal activity.",
      "In a letter seen by the BBC, lawyers for the EA said that our investigation would be carefully considered as part of a review it has launched into its approach to waste tyre shipments.",
      "They added that the EA has been working to engage the relevant environmental authorities in India on this issue and is taking steps to arrange a delegation to meet with officials later this year.",
      "Fighting Dirty founder Georgia Elliott-Smith, who has been in correspondence with the EA over this issue since 2023, said it was a \"major victory\" for the group and that \"the government must stop turning a blind eye to the illegal and immoral activity\".",

    "story": [
      "Sewage spilled illegally into England's largest lake on a record number of days last year, an analysis of water company data by campaigners suggests.",
      "The analysis, which the BBC had exclusive access to, used United Utilities operational data to establish when the company was discharging sewage into Windermere when it should by law have been treating some of it.",
      "The campaigners from Windrush Against Sewage Pollution (WASP) and Save Windermere identified 140 illegal spill days in 2024, more than in any of the three previous years.",
      "United Utilities told BBC News that the campaigners' findings were \"inaccurate\" and some of the data \"erroneous\".",
      "The company declined to put in writing, despite repeated requests, any specific examples of mistakes or omissions.",
      "Regulators Ofwat and the Environment Agency are both currently investigating United Utilities operations.",
      "Sewage dumped illegally in Windermere over 3 years",
      "Government vows to clean up England's largest lake",
      "Water firm behind spills says fixes will take time",
      "Part of the Lake District National Park Unesco World Heritage Site, Windermere is home to more than 14,000 people and its scenery attracts an estimated seven million visitors per year.",
      "But its pristine image is under threat. Regular discharges of sewage into Windermere have been blamed for increasing nutrient levels and turning parts of the lake green \u2013 so called \"algal blooming.\"",
      "The BBC has regularly reported on discharges into Windermere. Last October it was revealed that a single pumping station had illegally spilled more than 140 million litres of raw sewage between 2020 and 2023. In 2023 BBC Panorama said United Utilities was misreporting pollution incidents.",
      "Earlier in March environment secretary Steve Reed called the amount of pollution entering the lake \"a disgrace\" and pledged to clean it up.",
      "Last week the Environment Agency said United Utilities had spilled 77,817 times in 2024, the highest figure of all England's water companies.",
      "Many of the spills will have been legal. All water companies are legally allowed to discharge raw sewage to stop the network getting overwhelmed and this now happens regularly during periods of heavy rain.",
      "But almost all pumping stations and treatment plants operate under an environmental permit which specify that they must process or \"pass forward\" a certain amount of sewage and rainwater before spilling starts.",
      "The campaigners cross-referenced United Utilities datasets showing when an asset was spilling against how much sewage it was treating at the time. The campaigners' analysis \u2013 which has been shared with and scrutinised by the BBC -  found days when illegal spills appear to have occurred at each of six sewage facilities around the lake, which combined to 140 days in 2024. That's more than in any of the previous three years, as the chart below shows.",
      "The longest illegal spill the analysis identified was for 10 days from Hawkshead pumping station, which flows into Windermere via Cunsey Beck.",
      "\"This is an indication that their works have not been maintained properly or they're not being watched over properly,\" says Prof Peter Hammond, a mathematican and retired academic from campaign group Windrush Against Sewage Pollution.",
      "Prof Hammond's analysis of water company data has been cited by regulators and he has been praised in Parliament by water company executives for bringing problems to light they were previously unaware of.",
      "The latest analysis covers four years of data from six sites that discharge sewage into the Lake Windermere catchment.",
      "Comparisons over a longer time period are impossible as United Utilities has only had made full data sets available since 2021.",
      "The regulators Ofwat and the Environment Agency have since 2021 been investigating whether the water companies have been treating enough sewage before they start to spill. The EA call it a \"major criminal investigation\" while Ofwat call it \"the largest and most complex Ofwat has ever undertaken\".",
      "Last week Yorkshire Water agreed to a \u00a340m \"enforcement action\" after Ofwat uncovered \"serious failures\" in how it operated its treatment plant and network.",
      "Ofwat declined to comment on the campaigner's findings as their investigation into United Utilities is ongoing.",
      "In response to concerns about United Utilities the Environment Agency last year reviewed all of its environmental permits in the Windermere catchment and says this led directly to the water company tripling its investment plans for the area to \u00a3200m.",
      "\"We are currently carrying out investigations into suspected pollution incidents on the Windermere catchment and are unable to comment on these in detail until they have reached a conclusion,\" an EA spokesperson said when the campaigners' analysis was shared with them.",
      "\"Where we find breaches of environmental permits, we will take the appropriate enforcement action up to and including a criminal prosecution.\"",
      "United Utilities, which provides services to more than seven million people across north-west England, is more than \u00a39bn in debt. Its chief executive Louise Beardmore confirmed to parliament in February that she was last year paid \u00a31.4m including a bonus of \u00a3420,000.",
      "\"The methodology used by the campaigners is different to that used by the Environment Agency for its compliance assessments,\" the water company said in a statement.",
      "\"On top of that, erroneous data has been used, tags and naming conventions in data sets appear to have been misunderstood, and assumptions seem to have been made on whether different types of flow meters have been installed.\"",
      "\"The methodology fails to use other corroborating information from the sites which would prove that spills did not occur. As a result, the numbers quoted are inaccurate.\"",
      "BBC News presented United Utilities with five examples of illegal spills the campaigners' analysis had identified using the company's data and asked for any evidence or explanation as to why they were not illegal. United Utilities repeatedly declined to do so in writing or on camera.",
      "\"What we're seeing is the failure of privatisation. We're seeing a prioritisation of dividend returns over the long-term environmental protection of places like Windermere\" says Matt Staniek from Save Windermere.",
      "\"The bill payer has paid for a service that has never fully been provided, and the illegality demonstrates that for all to see.\"",
      "Over the next five years bills in the United Utilities area will go up by 32% above the rate of inflation. On average that will mean a rise of \u00a386 for the year that starts in April.",
      "Louise Beardmore said the rises will fund the \"largest investment in water and wastewater infrastructure in over 100 years\".",
      "For Windermere that's set to mean nine wastewater treatment works, including two that were included in the campaigners' analysis being upgraded and a reduction in the number of overflows discharging into the lake.",

    "story": [
      "Gothenburg, Sweden's second city, is highlighting its environmental credentials by continuing to put its money on the line.",
      "Back in 2022, the City of Gothenburg, became what is believed to be the first local government in the world to take out a \"sustainability linked loan\" or SLL.",
      "This is a form of financing pegged to a set of annual environmental and social improvements agreed between a borrower and its banks.",
      "Gothenburg's four target areas are efforts to make renewable energy the sole source of the city's heat production, making the council's own vehicle fleet electric, reducing energy usage in municipality-owned buildings, such as hospitals and schools, and improving the city's poorest neighbourhoods.",
      "Meet agreed annual improvement levels in these sectors and, for each, Gothenburg gets a discount on the yearly fee it pays for the loan of 0.1% or around 100,000 kronor ($10,500; \u00a38,000). But miss one of the targets by a certain amount and it has to pay a fine of the same amount.",
      "In 2022 and 2023 Gothenburg managed to avoid a financial penalty, but the newly released figures for 2024 show that it missed its target for switching to renewable energy. And so it is about to be fined 150,000 kroner.",
      "However, this is offset by the discounts it is getting for continuing to hit improvement levels for energy usage and social improvement. For electrifying the council's vehicles, while it missed its improvement goal, it didn't do so by enough to be fined.",
      "Fredrik Block, portfolio manager at the City of Gothenburg, says that the local authority deliberately set \"ambitious\" targets.",
      "\"You aim high, and you get the whole organisation to strive towards that target. We are not proceeding as fast as we expected, but we are taking one step at a time. The goal is still to be close to carbon-free by 2030.",
      "\"We're actually not doing it for the money. We're doing it to show the city's important work and that we are making progress every year. We want to show to the world how it is - that these are the problems, and these are the good things.\"",
      "The improvements to the city's poorest areas \u2013 and whether the council has hit its targets - are measured by yearly resident surveys. People are asked about their feelings towards an area's safety and cleanliness.",
      "Key initiatives have included making housing more secure, introducing more surveillance cameras and increasing police presence as a crime prevention measure in areas of the city like Hjallbo and Biskopsgarden. Located in the north of the city, they have high levels of crime and unemployment, and large immigrant populations.",
      "Public housing agency Framtiden, which is ultimately owned by the City of Gothenburg, says it takes the improvement work very seriously.",
      "\"For some of these vulnerable areas, we actually own the majority of the housing,\" says its research and development manager, Lars Bankvall.",
      "\"We are more or less the only official body in these areas. There's no one else there, only us.",
      "\"I see us as maybe the most powerful tool that the city has, because we have a lot of financial resources. We are involved in everything.\"",
      "But Faduma Awil, a social worker who now provides career coaching at an employment centre in Gothenburg, is concerned that increased cameras and police presence sends the wrong message to youth in Gothenburg's deprived areas - and could see racial profiling increase.",
      "\"What will our children think when they see cameras everywhere in Hjallbo, but none in a Swedish neighbourhood? How will they feel when they are constantly being watched by police?\" she says.",
      "\"What will you tell them? You are showing them there is a difference between them and native Swedes.\"",
      "Ms Awil is also not convinced the resident surveys are effective or accurate. And she feels the city is placing a disproportionate amount of effort into its environmental goals, at the expense of improving conditions in underprivileged areas.",
      "\"People in these areas don't care about the environment. They need to go to school. They need to work. They need to eat,\" says Ms Awil, who migrated from Somalia to Sweden in 1987 as a child.",
      "Negotiating an SLL is a rigorous, complex process - one that took the City of Gothenburg a year to do, with no fewer than six major Nordic banks involved.",
      "Such is the difficulty of acquiring an SLL that the number issued globally fell by 56% in 2023, according to data from financial news provider Bloomberg.",
      "Mats Olausson is senior sustainability advisor at Swedish bank SEB, which is the lead lender of Gothenburg's SLL.",
      "He says SEB has turned down potential SLL borrowers as the client's proposed targets weren't ambitious enough. Yet he adds that SLLs are challenging for companies or local authorities that successfully get one.",
      "\"It's sad if a company puts a lot of resources into designing an SLL, and then it turns out that the only publicity they get is negative,\" he says. \"You run the risk of being pulled into the dirt for having not done a good enough job.",
      "\"It's in no one's interest to have targets that are overly ambitious and basically impossible to achieve, or for companies who don't have the right governance in place to implement the actions that will be the building blocks of the actual strategy.\"",
      "One company that is happy with its SLL is Danish management consultancy Emagine. It borrowed \u00a310m in 2021, funds that helped it to acquire six other firms around the world.",
      "Its binding goals include increasing the number of female leaders in the organisation by 16%, and reducing overall employee turnover by 6% over the seven-year long period. It is doing this through leadership and mentoring programs.",
      "By meeting the targets, Emagine is benefiting from reduced interest rates, says Lars Bloch, the company's chief financial officer.",
      "\"If we didn't meet the goals, we would be landed with interest penalty rates. We also accept that failing to meet sustainability targets could harm the firm's reputation, as we have made a public commitment.",
      "\"It shouldn't be about committing to the loan to get a discount on financing - there needs to be ambition behind the goals.\"",
      "Back in Gothenburg, the city's current environmental and social targets run until 2030. Mr Block says that the detailed yearly SLL reporting shows to potential future investors in the city what a difference their money would make.",
      "\"Banks want to give money to sustainable cities, so packaging up our progress in our SLL reporting is how I make the city beautiful for investors,\" he says.",
      "\"I can't change the credit worthiness of the city, but I can change how investors look at our sustainability work, and make it more attractive to them.\"",

They came to a peak in April 2019, when protestors brought parts of the capital to a halt for more than a week and plonked a large pink boat in the middle of Oxford Circus.",
      "The spectacle and disruption XR caused generated massive media attention, but the police were furious.  Hundreds of officers were diverted from frontline duties and by the end of 2019 the bill for policing the protests had reached \u00a337m.",
      "And behind the scenes XR was riven by furious debates about tactics.  Many inside the movement said it should be less confrontational and disruptive but a hard core of activists argued it would be more effective to double down on direct action.",
      "It became clear that there was room for what Sarah Lunnon, one of the co-founders of Just Stop Oil, calls \"a more radical flank\".  They decided a new, more focused operation was needed, modelled on earlier civil disobedience movements like the Suffragettes, Gandhi's civil disobedience campaigns and the civil rights movement in the US.",
      "The group was formally launched on Valentine's Day, 2022. It was a very different animal to XR. Instead of thousands of people taking part in street carnivals, JSO's actions involved a few committed activists. A small strategy group oversaw the campaign and meticulously planned its activities. A mobilisation team worked to recruit new members, and another team focused on supporting activists after they were arrested.",
      "The dozens of actions the group has carried out generated lots of publicity, but also massive public opposition. There were confrontations between members of the public and protestors and an outcry from politicians across all the main political parties.",
      "The police said they needed more powers to deal with this new form of protest and they got them. New offences were created including interfering with national infrastructure, \"locking on\" \u2013 chaining or gluing yourself to something \u2013 and tunnelling underground. Causing a public nuisance also became a potential crime \u2013 providing the police with a powerful new tool to use against protestors who block roads.",
      "In the four years since it was formed dozens of the group's supporters have been jailed. Five activists were handed multi-year sentences for their role in the M25 actions in 2022. Those were reduced on appeal earlier this month but are still the longest jail terms for non-violent civil disobedience ever issued.",
      "Senior JSO members deny the crackdown had anything to do with the group's decision to \"hang up the hi-vis\" \u2013 as its statement this week announcing the end of campaign put it.",
      "JSO's public position is that it has won its battle. \"Just Stop Oil's initial demand to end new oil and gas is now government policy, making us one of the most successful civil resistance campaigns in recent history,\" the group claimed.",
      "The government has said it does not plan to issue any new licences for oil and gas production but strongly denies its policies have a link to JSO. Furthermore, the Prime Minister's official spokesperson told journalists: \"We have been very clear when it comes to oil and gas that it has a future for decades to come in our energy mix.\"",
      "And the group's wider goal \u2013 to end the production of oil and gas \u2013 has manifestly not been achieved. The members of the group I spoke to for this article all agree the climate crisis has deepened.",
      "In the face of stiffer sentences, some climate campaigners have said they will turn to more clandestine activities. One new group says it plans a campaign of sabotage against key infrastructure. In a manifesto published online it says it plans to \"kickstart a new phase of the climate activist movement, aiming to shut down key actors of the fossil fuel economy.\"",
      "That's not a direction the JSO members I spoke to said they wanted to go. Sarah Lunnon said a key principle of JSO and the civil disobedience movement generally was that activists would take responsibility for their actions. One of the first questions new joiners were asked is whether they would be willing to be locked up.",
      "\"As corporations and billionaires corrupt political systems across the world, we need a different approach.",
      "\"We are creating a new strategy, to face this reality and to carry our responsibilities at this time,\" the group says, suggesting they may be planning to form a new movement.",
      "JSO's most high-profile figure, Roger Hallam, is one of the five activists convicted for their role in the M25 protests. In a message from his prison cell he acknowledged that JSO has only had a \"marginal impact\".",
      "That is \"not due to lack of trying,\" he said. The failure lay with the UK's \"elites and our leaders\" who had walked away from their responsibility to tackle the climate crisis, Hallam claimed. A hint perhaps that the group's new focus might be on the political system itself.",
      "JSO has said its last protest \u2013 to be held at the end of April \u2013 will mark \"the end of soup on Van Goghs, cornstarch on Stonehenge and slow marching in the streets\". But don't believe it. When pressed, the JSO members I spoke to said they may well turn back to disruptive tactics but under a new name and with a new and as yet unspecified objective.",

    "published": "Thu, 27 Mar 2025 12:13:45 GMT",
    "summary": "Sewage spilled into England's waterways for a record number of hours last year, the Environmental Agency says.",
    "story": [
      "Water companies released raw sewage into England's rivers and seas for a record 3.61 million hours last year, a slight increase on 2023.",
      "The data released by Environment Agency on Thursday showed that although the number of spills was down each spill lasted longer on average - resulting in a higher total number of hours.",
      "Some spilling can be legal, but concern has been mounting amongst scientists about the harm that regular sewage spilling is causing the country's aquatic life.",
      "Water UK, the industry body, said sewage spills are a \"disgrace\" but has committed to a programme of investment worth \u00a3104bn over the next five years.",
      "How much sewage is spilled near you?",
      "Water company makes case for higher bill increases",
      "\"These figures are disgraceful and are a stark reminder of how years of underinvestment have led to water companies discharging unacceptable levels of sewage into our rivers, lakes, and seas,\" said Environment Secretary Steve Reed.",
      "His views were echoed by Water UK Chief Executive David Henderson: \"Any sewage flowing into waterways is a disgrace. Unfortunately, it's a system fault that we have in our network which mixes rainwater and wastewater. Nobody wants to see any spill of sewage in our waterways.\"",
      "England, like much of the world, has a combined sewage system meaning that rainwater and sewage share the same pipes. In some instances, when there is too much rain, treatment works can be overwhelmed, and sewage is spilled via overflow points into the country's rivers, lakes and seas to prevent a back up to the system.",
      "This practice is legal. But previous investigations by the BBC and Environment Agency have revealed that sewage has also been spilled by water companies under dry conditions in breach of their permits.",
      "Water companies collectively oversee more than 15,000 of these overflow sites and this was the first year where all sites were monitored, revealing for the first time the extent of spilling.",
      "Sewage was spilt for 3.614 million hours in 2024 compared to 3.606 million hours in 2023.",
      "CEO of River Action, James Wallace, said: \"A year on from last year's catastrophic pollution figures, the true scale of the UK's water crisis is only now coming to light. The figures have barely budged, testament to the deepening sewage scandal.\"",
      "In 2022, Prof Chris Whitty, chief medical office for the UK, outlined the serious health risks sewage spills can pose for those using the country's waterways. Chief amongst them is bacteria from human faeces which he said can \"increase the risk of significant infections including antibiotic resistant bacteria\".",
      "Sewage also poses significant environmental risks \u2013 it increases nutrients in the water leading to algal blooms which then eventually denies other wildlife \u2013 like fish - oxygen. These spills also have been shown to introduce microplastics, drugs and sanitary products into rivers and seas.",
      "The River Ver in St Albans is one such location - the banks are littered with condoms, tampon applicators and wet wipes likely from sewage releases from nearby Markyate sewage treatment works owned by Thames Water. This rare chalk stream \u2013 one of around 200 worldwide \u2013 which supports important wildlife like water voles, saw more than 3,300 hours of spills in 2024.",
      "Of the spills a Thames Water spokesperson said: \"The Markyate area experienced one of the wettest years on record in 2024 which has caused excessive amounts of groundwater which has infiltrated into the network. This has resulted in the system being overwhelmed which has led to discharges into the river.\"",
      "Liberal Democrats Leader Ed Davey said the scale of spilling showed that the sector regulator, Ofwat, was not up to the task.",
      "\"This has to be the final nail in the coffin for Ofwat, a regulator that has time and again proven it is completely inadequate to protect customers and our beautiful environment,\" he said.",
      "In October, the government launched an Independent Water Commission, chaired by former deputy Bank of England governor Sir Jon Cunliffe, to look into the sector - including the effectiveness of Ofwat.",
      "An Ofwat spokesperson said: \"Where companies miss their targets, they will be penalised and money will be returned to customers. In parallel, companies will be held to account for past failures through our ongoing enforcement work into the operation and maintenance of sewage works and networks.\"",
      "The Markyate site is one of a number across the country that is due an upgrade as part of a five-year \u00a3104bn investment programme by water companies \u2013 with \u00a324bn going specifically to improving infrastructure.",
      "These upgrades will be paid largely through bill rises \u2013 which are due to take effect from 1 April \u2013 and will see the average annual bill hit \u00a3603. This has angered consumer groups and environmental charities who argue that the burden of upgrades should be carried by shareholders not households.",
      "Prof Ewan McGaughey, Professor of Law at Kings College London, said: \"The water companies have paid over \u00a385bn out to shareholders since privatisation and that means they haven't been able to put the money into infrastructure.\"",
      "Ofwat and the industry have previously denied the figure\u2013 which comes from University of Greenwich research \u2013 is as high, but there is agreement that significant investment is required.",
      "Phillip Clisham, specialist adviser to the Institution of Civil Engineers on water and sanitation, has worked in the industry for more than three decades, and said the challenge of fixing the issue has been \"underestimated\".",
      "He said the two main solutions are building bigger storm tanks \u2013 which produce a huge amount of planet warming emissions in their construction \u2013 or to reduce excess rainwater by increasing green areas and the use of sustainable urban drainage systems.",
      "What are sustainable urban drainage systems?",
      "What are sustainable urban drainage systems?",
      "It is this second solution that is preferable for the environment, he said, but it requires coordination between government, planning officers and housing developers \u2013 and takes longer to implement.",
      "\"A lot of this work is not as easy as it might seem from the outside in reality.",
      "\"I think it would be preferable for me to go a bit slower, get it right. But politically there's an awful lot of pressure to fix things now, and I do worry about the next 5 years,\" he said.",

    "story": [
      "Imagine an electric drone mixed with a fixed wing plane - that is the concept behind a new two-seater aircraft being developed by start-up company, Skyfly.",
      "The Axe promises the flexibility of a helicopter but without the cost, noise pollution or carbon emissions.",
      "It is a vertically capable aircraft, or Electric Vertical Take-off and Landing (eVTOL) aircraft, which means it can take off like a helicopter.",
      "It also has two fixed wings that allows it to take off and land from a runway.",
      "The company claims the Axe has a top speed of 100mph, it can carry up to 172kg - approximately the weight of two 13.5st adults - and has a range of 100 miles, about the distance from Oxford to the Isle of Wight.",
      "The team, based near Banbury in Oxfordshire, has taken five years to fine tune the design.",
      "\"Compared to a conventional aircraft it's got eight motors which is very strange,\" says Dr Bill Brooks, Skyfly's chief technical engineer.",
      "\"And it's a tail-first layout called a canard so it's got the tail at the front.  The all up weight is 750kg but 240kg of that are batteries so all the structure is carbon fibre to keep it as light as possible,\" Dr Brooks says.",
      "Safety is an important part of the design too.",
      "'Environmental benefits'",
      "The large wings help it to glide in the event of power failure and there are two motors at the end of each wing so that if one fails the other can compensate.",
      "It is also equipped with an emergency ballistic parachute to bring the aircraft and passengers down safely.",
      "As well as being safer and cleaner than conventional aircraft, Michael Thompson, Skyfly's chief executive, says electric models are significantly quieter too.",
      "\"When you're taking off, you're no longer annoying everyone around you from a noise perspective, so I do think electric propulsion brings not only environmental benefits but from a noise pollution point of view, it's a huge benefit as well,\" he says.",
      "Who is it marketed at?",
      "Other eVTOLs under development include those looking to provide an electric flying-taxi service like Bristol-based Vertical Aerospace (VA) .",
      "VA, as well as Archer and Joby in the US, are designing electric powered aircraft to carry up to four passengers.",
      "Skyfly's Axe, by comparison, is more compact and aimed at the private market.",
      "The do-it-youself kit-plane comes with a price tag of \u00a3250,000.",
      "It is aimed at existing pilots who want to transition away from diesel piston engines.",
      "Jason Pritchard, executive editor of eVTOL Insights, says it is also likely to appeal to flying clubs in order to train new members:",
      "\"The eVTOL aircraft industry is still in its infancy with initial operations a few years away, but it also needs to train large numbers of pilots in the coming years,\" he says.",
      "\"Additionally, the Axe's design can also train pilots with the skills and controls necessary to land an aircraft without power, which is a necessary tool.\"",
      "What about charging infrastructure?",
      "While the Axe can be charged up overnight with a conventional three-pin plug, just like EV cars, electric aircraft will need the charging infrastructure to be scaled up.",
      "Aerovolt, based in West Sussex, has installed rapid chargers at seven UK airports with 40 more in the pipeline.",
      "Its founder, Philip Kingsley-Dobson, says demand is growing.",
      "\"A lot of piston aircraft can't use leaded fuel in the future so they're looking for alternatives and ways we can decarbonise the lower end of aviation,\" he says.",
      "'Cutting edge'",
      "There are no eVTOL aircraft currently permitted to fly in the UK.",
      "Skyfly's Axe has successfully completed manned test flights in both hover and forward flight modes but still needs to be certified by the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA).",
      "With 40 pre-orders from buyers all over the world, the company hopes to deliver the new model to customers early next year.",

    "story": [
      "Gothenburg, Sweden's second city, is highlighting its environmental credentials by continuing to put its money on the line.",
      "Back in 2022, the City of Gothenburg, became what is believed to be the first local government in the world to take out a \"sustainability linked loan\" or SLL.",
      "This is a form of financing pegged to a set of annual environmental and social improvements agreed between a borrower and its banks.",
      "Gothenburg's four target areas are efforts to make renewable energy the sole source of the city's heat production, making the council's own vehicle fleet electric, reducing energy usage in municipality-owned buildings, such as hospitals and schools, and improving the city's poorest neighbourhoods.",
      "Meet agreed annual improvement levels in these sectors and, for each, Gothenburg gets a discount on the yearly fee it pays for the loan of 0.1% or around 100,000 kronor ($10,500; \u00a38,000). But miss one of the targets by a certain amount and it has to pay a fine of the same amount.",
      "In 2022 and 2023 Gothenburg managed to avoid a financial penalty, but the newly released figures for 2024 show that it missed its target for switching to renewable energy. And so it is about to be fined 150,000 kroner.",
      "However, this is offset by the discounts it is getting for continuing to hit improvement levels for energy usage and social improvement. For electrifying the council's vehicles, while it missed its improvement goal, it didn't do so by enough to be fined.",
      "Fredrik Block, portfolio manager at the City of Gothenburg, says that the local authority deliberately set \"ambitious\" targets.",
      "\"You aim high, and you get the whole organisation to strive towards that target. We are not proceeding as fast as we expected, but we are taking one step at a time. The goal is still to be close to carbon-free by 2030.",
      "\"We're actually not doing it for the money. We're doing it to show the city's important work and that we are making progress every year. We want to show to the world how it is - that these are the problems, and these are the good things.\"",
      "The improvements to the city's poorest areas \u2013 and whether the council has hit its targets - are measured by yearly resident surveys. People are asked about their feelings towards an area's safety and cleanliness.",
      "Key initiatives have included making housing more secure, introducing more surveillance cameras and increasing police presence as a crime prevention measure in areas of the city like Hjallbo and Biskopsgarden. Located in the north of the city, they have high levels of crime and unemployment, and large immigrant populations.",
      "Public housing agency Framtiden, which is ultimately owned by the City of Gothenburg, says it takes the improvement work very seriously.",
      "\"For some of these vulnerable areas, we actually own the majority of the housing,\" says its research and development manager, Lars Bankvall.",
      "\"We are more or less the only official body in these areas. There's no one else there, only us.",
      "\"I see us as maybe the most powerful tool that the city has, because we have a lot of financial resources. We are involved in everything.\"",
      "But Faduma Awil, a social worker who now provides career coaching at an employment centre in Gothenburg, is concerned that increased cameras and police presence sends the wrong message to youth in Gothenburg's deprived areas - and could see racial profiling increase.",
      "\"What will our children think when they see cameras everywhere in Hjallbo, but none in a Swedish neighbourhood? How will they feel when they are constantly being watched by police?\" she says.",
      "\"What will you tell them? You are showing them there is a difference between them and native Swedes.\"",
      "Ms Awil is also not convinced the resident surveys are effective or accurate. And she feels the city is placing a disproportionate amount of effort into its environmental goals, at the expense of improving conditions in underprivileged areas.",
      "\"People in these areas don't care about the environment. They need to go to school. They need to work. They need to eat,\" says Ms Awil, who migrated from Somalia to Sweden in 1987 as a child.",
      "Negotiating an SLL is a rigorous, complex process - one that took the City of Gothenburg a year to do, with no fewer than six major Nordic banks involved.",
      "Such is the difficulty of acquiring an SLL that the number issued globally fell by 56% in 2023, according to data from financial news provider Bloomberg.",
      "Mats Olausson is senior sustainability advisor at Swedish bank SEB, which is the lead lender of Gothenburg's SLL.",
      "He says SEB has turned down potential SLL borrowers as the client's proposed targets weren't ambitious enough. Yet he adds that SLLs are challenging for companies or local authorities that successfully get one.",
      "\"It's sad if a company puts a lot of resources into designing an SLL, and then it turns out that the only publicity they get is negative,\" he says. \"You run the risk of being pulled into the dirt for having not done a good enough job.",
      "\"It's in no one's interest to have targets that are overly ambitious and basically impossible to achieve, or for companies who don't have the right governance in place to implement the actions that will be the building blocks of the actual strategy.\"",
      "One company that is happy with its SLL is Danish management consultancy Emagine. It borrowed \u00a310m in 2021, funds that helped it to acquire six other firms around the world.",
      "Its binding goals include increasing the number of female leaders in the organisation by 16%, and reducing overall employee turnover by 6% over the seven-year long period. It is doing this through leadership and mentoring programs.",
      "By meeting the targets, Emagine is benefiting from reduced interest rates, says Lars Bloch, the company's chief financial officer.",
      "\"If we didn't meet the goals, we would be landed with interest penalty rates. We also accept that failing to meet sustainability targets could harm the firm's reputation, as we have made a public commitment.",
      "\"It shouldn't be about committing to the loan to get a discount on financing - there needs to be ambition behind the goals.\"",

      "The climate action group Just Stop Oil has announced it is to disband at the end of April. Its activists have been derided as attention-seeking zealots and vandals and it is loathed by many for its disruptive direct action tactics. It says it has won because its demand that there should be no new oil and gas licences is now government policy.  So, did they really win and does this mark an end to the chaos caused by its climate protests?",
      "Hayley Walsh's heart was racing as she sat in the audience at the Theatre Royal Drury Lane on 27 January this year.",
      "The 42 year-old lecturer and mother of three tried to calm her breathing. Hollywood star Sigourney Weaver was onstage in her West End debut production of Shakespeare's The Tempest.",

      "They launched a confetti cannon and unfurled a banner that read \"Over 1.5 Degrees is a Global Shipwreck\" - a reference to the news that 2024 was the first year to pass the symbolic 1.5C threshold in global average temperature rise, and a nod to the shipwreck theme in the play.",
      "It was a classic Just Stop Oil (JSO) action. The target was high profile and would guarantee publicity. The message was simple and presented in the group's signature fluorescent orange.",
      "The reaction of those affected was also a classic response to JSO.  Amid the boos and whistles you can hear a shout of \"idiots\".",
      "\"Drag them off the stage\", one audience member can be heard shouting, \"I hope you [expletive] get arrested,\" another says.",
      "JSO is a UK-based environmental activist group that aims to end fossil fuel extraction and uses direct action to draw attention to its cause. It has been called a \"criminal cult\" and its activists branded \"eco-loons\" by the Sun. The Daily Mail has described it as \"deranged\" and says its members have \"unleashed misery on thousands of ordinary people though their selfish antics\".",
      "The group has thrown soup at a Van Gogh in the National Gallery, exploded a chalk dust bomb during the World Snooker Championship in Sheffield, smashed a cabinet containing a copy of the Magna Carta at the British Library, sprayed temporary paint on the stones of Stonehenge and even defaced Charles Darwin's grave.",
      "But it is the group's road protests that have probably caused the most disruption \u2013 and public anger. In November 2022, 45 JSO members climbed gantries around the M25 severely disrupting traffic for over four days. People missed flights, medical appointments and exams as thousands of drivers were delayed for hours. The cost to the Metropolitan Police was put at \u00a31.1 million.",
      "Just Stop Oil was born out of Extinction Rebellion (XR).  XR \u2013 founded in 2018 - brought thousands of people onto the streets in what were dubbed \"festivals of resistance\".  They came to a peak in April 2019, when protestors brought parts of the capital to a halt for more than a week and plonked a large pink boat in the middle of Oxford Circus.",

They decided a new, more focused operation was needed, modelled on earlier civil disobedience movements like the Suffragettes, Gandhi's civil disobedience campaigns and the civil rights movement in the US.",
      "The group was formally launched on Valentine's Day, 2022. It was a very different animal to XR. Instead of thousands of people taking part in street carnivals, JSO's actions involved a few committed activists. A small strategy group oversaw the campaign and meticulously planned its activities. A mobilisation team worked to recruit new members, and another team focused on supporting activists after they were arrested.",
      "The dozens of actions the group has carried out generated lots of publicity, but also massive public opposition. There were confrontations between members of the public and protestors and an outcry from politicians across all the main political parties.",
      "The police said they needed more powers to deal with this new form of protest and they got them. New offences were created including interfering with national infrastructure, \"locking on\" \u2013 chaining or gluing yourself to something \u2013 and tunnelling underground. Causing a public nuisance also became a potential crime \u2013 providing the police with a powerful new tool to use against protestors who block roads.",
      "In the four years since it was formed dozens of the group's supporters have been jailed. Five activists were handed multi-year sentences for their role in the M25 actions in 2022. Those were reduced on appeal earlier this month but are still the longest jail terms for non-violent civil disobedience ever issued.",
      "Senior JSO members deny the crackdown had anything to do with the group's decision to \"hang up the hi-vis\" \u2013 as its statement this week announcing the end of campaign put it.",
      "JSO's public position is that it has won its battle. \"Just Stop Oil's initial demand to end new oil and gas is now government policy, making us one of the most successful civil resistance campaigns in recent history,\" the group claimed.",
      "The government has said it does not plan to issue any new licences for oil and gas production but strongly denies its policies have a link to JSO. Furthermore, the Prime Minister's official spokesperson told journalists: \"We have been very clear when it comes to oil and gas that it has a future for decades to come in our energy mix.\"",
      "And the group's wider goal \u2013 to end the production of oil and gas \u2013 has manifestly not been achieved. The members of the group I spoke to for this article all agree the climate crisis has deepened.",
      "In the face of stiffer sentences, some climate campaigners have said they will turn to more clandestine activities. One new group says it plans a campaign of sabotage against key infrastructure. In a manifesto published online it says it plans to \"kickstart a new phase of the climate activist movement, aiming to shut down key actors of the fossil fuel economy.\"",
      "That's not a direction the JSO members I spoke to said they wanted to go. Sarah Lunnon said a key principle of JSO and the civil disobedience movement generally was that activists would take responsibility for their actions. One of the first questions new joiners were asked is whether they would be willing to be locked up.",
      "\"As corporations and billionaires corrupt political systems across the world, we need a different approach.",
      "\"We are creating a new strategy, to face this reality and to carry our responsibilities at this time,\" the group says, suggesting they may be planning to form a new movement.",
      "JSO's most high-profile figure, Roger Hallam, is one of the five activists convicted for their role in the M25 protests. In a message from his prison cell he acknowledged that JSO has only had a \"marginal impact\".",
      "That is \"not due to lack of trying,\" he said. The failure lay with the UK's \"elites and our leaders\" who had walked away from their responsibility to tackle the climate crisis, Hallam claimed. A hint perhaps that the group's new focus might be on the political system itself.",
      "JSO has said its last protest \u2013 to be held at the end of April \u2013 will mark \"the end of soup on Van Goghs, cornstarch on Stonehenge and slow marching in the streets\". But don't believe it. When pressed, the JSO members I spoke to said they may well turn back to disruptive tactics but under a new name and with a new and as yet unspecified objective.",

    "story": [
      "People who spend more time looking at a screen in bed are more likely to report insomnia and sleep loss, a study has found.",
      "The research is based on a Norwegian survey of more than 45,000 students.",
      "It indicates that each additional hour of screen time was linked to a 63% increase in insomnia risk, and 24 minutes less sleep.",
      "However, the researchers said they had only established a correlation between screen use and lower sleep quality and had not demonstrated that the former caused the latter.",
      "Experts say putting down your phone before bed, doing something relaxing and establishing a routine may help improve sleep.",
      "Why you should go to sleep at the same time all week",
      "Why you should go to sleep at the same time all week",
      "The researchers behind the study, based on nationally representative survey data of 18-28 year old students gathered in 2022, wanted to examine the link between the amount of time spent using screens in bed and sleep patterns.",
      "They also sought to probe the impact on sleep of using social media compared to other screen activities.",
      "Dr Gunnhild Johnsen Hjetland of the Norwegian Institute of Public Health, who is lead author of the research - which was published in a Frontiers journal - said the type of screen activity appeared to be less impactful than screen time on the whole.",
      "\"We found no significant differences between social media and other screen activities, suggesting that screen use itself is the key factor in sleep disruption,\" he said.",
      "Sleep or social media",
      "The 2022 Norway health and wellbeing survey asked participants to identify if they used any digital media after they had gone to bed.",
      "Options included watching films or TV, checking social media, browsing the internet and gaming.",
      "Among those saying they used screens in bed before sleep, 69% said they used social media as well as other screen-based activities.",
      "Participants were also asked to identify how many nights a week they would engage with such media, and for how much time, as well as how often they had difficultly falling or staying asleep, waking up early or experiencing tiredness.",
      "It identified those who said they experienced such issues at least three nights or days a week, for at least three months as experiencing insomnia.",
      "While the study found a link between bedtime screen use and people reporting sleep disruption or insomnia, researchers say it does not mean it is a cause.",
      "\"This study cannot determine causality \u2014 for example, whether screen use causes insomnia or if students with insomnia use screens more,\" said Dr Hjetland.",
      "They also note that the study's reliance on survey data of self-reported experiences may mean it contains biases, and its findings should not be considered globally representative.",
      "Joshua Piper, a sleep clinician at ResMed UK, said the study provided \"valuable, mounting evidence\" of electronic device use negatively impacting sleep.",
      "\"It steals both opportunity and the quality of your sleep, which is why some may struggle for onset, others struggle to stay asleep,\" he told the BBC.",
      "While people may try to mitigate the impact by adjusting screen brightness or using night mode, Mr Piper said previous studies suggested it was scrolling and engaging with a device that was likely to cause sleep disruptions.",
      "Tips for better sleep",
      "Insomnia is believed to affect as many as one in three people in the UK.",
      "The sleep disorder is among a whole host of problems people have reported experiencing with sleep - with late night phone use and doomscrolling often blamed.",
      "While common practice, the actual impact of using social media or scrolling through online content in bed on physical and mental health remains contested.",
      "Still, experts recommend that people stop using digital devices shortly before trying to go to sleep.",
      "They also say establishing a routine by going to bed and getting up at the same time every day may help improve sleep.",
      "Mental health charities Mind and Rethink recommend trying to do something relaxing before going to sleep such as breathing exercises, reading a book or having a bath, rather than trying to force yourself to sleep.",
      "They also suggest avoiding caffeine, alcohol or large meals before bed, doing gentle exercise and trying to make your bedroom more comfortable, where possible.",
      "Sleep therapist Dr Kat Lederle told the BBC that getting exposure to natural daylight, particularly in the morning, was vital to help regulate our internal body clock.",
      "She said finding ways to \"let go of the busy, thinking day\", such as by doing an enjoyable activity that is not too stimulating, can also be key to better sleep.",
      "The authors of this study echo the need for further research into the subject, including longer-term monitoring of sleep patterns as well as investigations into areas such as the disruption caused overnight by device notifications.",

    "summary": "The president says he would like TikTok to 'remain alive' as his extended deadline for its sale-or-ban approaches.",
    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump has said a deal to sell TikTok will be made by 5 April, as questions swirl over whether the app will be banned in the United States.",
      "The platform 'went dark' for US users in January as a law took effect which banned the app unless it was sold by its parent company ByteDance.",
      "But TikTok returned less than a day later following Trump's election win, and he signed an executive order delaying its sale or ban by 75 days.",
      "Tech companies, celebrities and investors have since lined up to buy the app.",
      "Has Trump overturned the US TikTok ban?",
      "An executive order is an instruction from the president which has the weight of the law behind it.",
      "Trump signed such an order regarding TikTok's sale or ban on 21 January, shortly after his inauguration.",
      "But the president's order does not overturn the ban.",
      "Instead it tells the US attorney general not to enforce the law for now - something experts had expected would be his first move.",
      "That buys time for his administration to, as the order puts it, \"determine the appropriate course of action\".",
      "It allows the president to directly oppose a ruling by the Supreme Court upholding the law to ban TikTok on 17 January.",
      "The Supreme Court's ruling said the ban was \"designed to prevent China - a designated foreign adversary - from leveraging its control over ByteDance to capture the personal data of US TikTok users\".",
      "Could TikTok be banned again in the US?",
      "Trump's extended deadline for TikTok's sale or ban gives ByteDance until 5 April to find a buyer.",
      "If no deal is reached the app could once again face a US ban and be pulled from mobile app stores.",
      "However, Trump could allow the law to stand but tell the Department of Justice (DoJ) to continue to ignore it.",
      "The government would be effectively telling Apple and Google they will not be punished for allowing people to download TikTok onto their devices - meaning the law would remain in place but would essentially be redundant.",
      "TikTok returned to Google's Play Store and Apple's App Store in February, after the companies were reportedly told they would not face consequences for hosting it.",
      "Trump has also said he would \"probably\" extend the deadline, if needed.",
      "Could TikTok ever be banned in the UK too?",
      "Who might buy TikTok?",
      "ByteDance has long insisted that TikTok is not for sale, and whether that has changed under Trump's presidency remains unclear.",
      "The president told reporters on 30 March there were \"a lot of potential buyers\" and \"tremendous interest\" in buying the app.",
      "He said earlier in March his administration was talking to four different groups about a potential sale.",
      "Trump appears to want to find a compromise that complies with the spirit rather than the letter of law.",
      "He has also floated the idea of TikTok being jointly owned - telling reporters he was seeking a 50-50 partnership between \"the United States\" and ByteDance.",
      "Meanwhile, several names have been floated as potential buyers of the company.",
      "Trump said he would be open to selling TikTok to Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison, as well as Elon Musk.",
      "Previous names linked with buying TikTok include billionaire Frank McCourt and the Canadian businessman Kevin O'Leary - a celebrity investor on Shark Tank, the US version of Dragon's Den.",
      "Alexis Ohanian, who co-founded Reddit, said in a post on X in March he had joined Mr McCourt's bid.",
      "\"The list of people who do not want to buy TikTok is much smaller than the list who do,\" Mr Musk replied.",
      "The biggest YouTuber in the world Jimmy Donaldson - AKA MrBeast - has also claimed he is in the running after a number of investors contacted him following an earlier tweet signalling his interest.",
      "Companies including Microsoft are even among those involved in discussions to buy TikTok, according to Trump.",
      "A US search engine called Perplexity AI has also reportedly offered to merge with TikTok.",
      "What other platforms could TikTok users use instead?",
      "TikTok says it has 170 million US users who spent - on average - 51 minutes per day on the app in 2024.",
      "Experts say rivals such as Instagram Reels and YouTube Shorts could benefit if Trump's efforts to fully restore TikTok don't succeed.",
      "Users bring advertisers - so this could be a big financial boost to those platforms.",
      "\"Chief marketing officers who we've spoken with confirmed that they will divert their media dollars to Meta and Google if they can no longer advertise on TikTok,\" said Kelsey Chickering, an analyst at market research company Forrester.",
      "Other potential winners include Twitch, which made its name by hosting livestreams - a popular feature on TikTok. Twitch is well known particularly to gamers, though its other content is expanding too.",
      "Other Chinese-owned platforms, such as Xiaohongshu - known as RedNote among its US users - have also seen rapid growth in the US and the UK."

      "Wania Eshaal Ahmad, the 15-year-old chair of the committee, said it was \"quite abhorrent\" that social media algorithms could inadvertently promote violent and harmful content to keep young people engaged.",
      "She said some young people were becoming desensitised to glorified violence online, because of how often it is shown to them.",
      "The committee called for better media literacy education in schools, including about how algorithms work and how students can \"protect themselves and distinguish fact from fiction\".",
      "The report also called for more training and support for teachers, parents and carers to help educate young people on the potential dangers of the online world.",
      "The report welcomed measures in the Online Safety Act, but said the act was not robust enough to enforce minimum age limits on social media platforms, or to ensure children and young people would be protected from harmful content.",
      "The Act puts more responsibility on social media companies to prevent their services being used for illegal activity, and to take down illegal content when it does appear.",
      "Those measures have already been introduced. A government spokesperson said those were \"just the beginning\", and more were due to come into effect this year.",

      "While the committee said the act does not go far enough, its report said banning social media for under-16s was not the answer.",
      "Many young people could find ways around age verification methods, and a ban would stop them accessing positive content on social media, the report said.",
      "The committee instead called on the government to hold social media companies to account more effectively.",
      "Members also said young people should be consulted more often in discussions around staying safe online, saying their experience and ideas for solutions were \"vital to shaping real change\".",
      "\"Responsibility is a very key aspect of our report,\" Wania said.",

      "Mr Springett's online persona developed over time, interacting with other artificial characters, and even went as far as to start its own Beanie Babies [a line of soft toys] collection.",
      "He said it was like AIs were writing their own soap operas inside a simulation.",
      "\"I didn't engage with Butterflies in the same way I do with other platforms,\" Mr Springett told BBC.",
      "\"It felt more like observing than participating. I wouldn't pay for it, but it was interesting enough to keep watching.\"",
      "A host of social media services, like Butterflies, are trying to expand at a time when there is dissatisfaction with the social media giants.",
      "According to data from Similarweb, a digital market intelligence company, X's daily active users in the UK have dropped by nearly 25% since January 2024.",
      "And it's not just X that has been suffering, mobile and desktop traffic to Facebook has declined over the last few years according to Similarweb.",
      "A report by the Pew Research Centre found that a third of teens use Facebook and X, compared with three quarters a decade ago.",
      "Bluesky is one of the social media firms gaining ground.",
      "Over the past year, Bluesky has gained tens of millions of new users, often at the expense of X.",
      "Apart from just timing, though, BlueSky's success can be largely attributed to its novel architecture, which pairs an X-like experience with a high degree of customization.",
      "Unlike centralized systems, where social media companies have complete control over content and identities, Bluesky users can choose how their feeds are moderated, and what kind of posts the algorithm recommends to them, thanks to the hundreds of options offered by both Bluesky and the community.",
      "Don't like the broader discourse on Bluesky? Jump on the \"popular with friends\" feed to see what the people you follow specifically are talking about.",
      "It will not be simple for Bluesky to scale up to the size of X and Facebook, says Andy Tattersall, an information specialist at the University of Sheffield.",
      "He ways it will have to strike a balance between \"generating revenue, keeping users safe, and moderating content, which is much easier said than done\".",
      "Celebrity-backed foundation, Free Our Feeds, hopes to do that.",
      "It's backed some notable names, including musician Brian Eno and actor Mark Ruffalo, and plans to raise $30m (\u00a323m) over the next three years to support an open social media ecosystem powered by the AT Protocol, the decentralized network powering Bluesky.",
      "\"Bluesky has created a strong foundation for shared social media infrastructure,\" says Robin Berjon, one of Free Our Feeds' nine custodians, \"but so long as they are the primary operator of this infrastructure the risk remains that it will stop operating in the public interest\".",
      "A bigger worry for these emerging platforms, though, is the network barrier. This can be summed up with Metcalfe's Law, explains Evan Prodromou, co-author and current editor of ActivityPub, another open social media architecture, which is behind popular platforms like Meta's Threads.",
      "The law states that the value of a network goes up with the square of the number of users. That means that bigger social networks have way more resources than smaller ones. They can use those resources to get bigger and bigger and crowd out smaller social media services.",
      "Non-profits like Free Our Feeds and the Social Web Foundation, which Mr Prodromou heads, have a strategy that they hope will help them overcome that Metcalfe's Law.",
      "They hope to replace the current situation, where users of social media hop between their favourite services.",
      "Instead Social Web Foundation is developing a platform which can offer content from all of them.",
      "Threads for example supports a protocol called ActivityPub, which makes it easier to combine services with other social media firms that use that protocol - like Mastodon for instance.",
      "Using this kind of interoperability, Mr Prodromou hopes that services like Social Web Foundation will provide the same value as giant, monolithic platforms.",
      "It's not straightforward, as not all social media firms support the same protocol, for example, BlueSky uses the AT Protocol.",
      "But there are workarounds to that problem, and Free Our Feeds and Social Web Foundation are also working on ways to aggregate sites that use different tech.",
      "\"One thing we've learnt from the past decades is that the last thing the world needs is a one-size-fits all solution for eight billion people,\" says Mr Berjon.",
      "At the other end of the spectrum are those that want to carve a niche out for themselves, rather than replace the incumbents.",
      "In the last couple of years, a cottage industry of unique, new social apps has cropped.",
      "One of those is Mozi, created by Twitter co-founder Ev Williams. Mozi doesn't want you to socialise online at all.",
      "Instead it informs you when you're going to be in the same place (city or event) as someone you know and encourages you to connect with people more often in person.",
      "\"Until Mozi, no combination of apps could tell me what city my friends are in at any given time, or even what my friends locally are up to,\" says Mozi co-founder, Molly DeWolf Swenson.",
      "Mike McCue, the CEO of Flipboard, is convinced such innovation will result in a new era of social networking, where numerous new, more interesting types of social networks will emerge and offer people more choices.",
      "He hopes that Flipboard's app, Surf will help people manage a messy social media ecosystem. It allows users to browse from a centralized feed that can draw posts and content from a variety of platforms, including Threads, Bluesky, and YouTube.",
      "\"In the end,\" says Mr McCue, \"it's unlikely one service will replace the Facebook or Twitter we once knew, but instead several services will start to take our time away from these old-style single feed experiences, our behaviours will shift with these new choices and new generations will expect more.\"",

    "summary": "The president is expected to unveil details of his plans for a wider set of import taxes. But what tariffs and when?",
    "story": [
      "Donald Trump says tariffs are coming. That message from the US president has been consistent.",
      "But what tariffs and when? Import taxes have come so thick and fast since he took office that it can be hard to keep track.",
      "Trump has already raised duties on Chinese imports, as well as steel, aluminium and some goods from Canada and Mexico. Higher levies on cars are due to go into effect this week.",
      "We're now waiting for Trump to unveil the details of his plan for a wider set of tariffs, which his team has spent the last few weeks developing.",
      "The White House is calling it \"Liberation Day\". So what might we learn on Wednesday?",
      "World braces as Trump set to announce sweeping tariffs",
      "How big are the tariffs?",
      "The White House has not said how high the tariffs could go, although various possible rates have been floated by analysts.",
      "On the campaign trail last year, Trump backed a 10% across-the-board tariff on all imports coming into the US, sometimes suggesting that could be 20% - even 60% on imports from China.",
      "Once in office, he introduced the idea of \"reciprocal\" tariffs, suggesting the rates could vary country by country.",
      "\"Very simply, it's if they charge us, we charge them,\" he said in February, shortly before he ordered officials to develop such a plan.",
      "The White House almost immediately complicated the picture, noting that their recommendations would reflect not just tariffs but also other policies they believe are unfair to US businesses, like Value Added Tax (VAT).",
      "It has a led to a scramble, as businesses and political leaders try to get a sense of how big a new tax their products might be facing; and how whatever is announced on Wednesday will interact with other duties, such as those on steel and aluminium, already put into effect by Trump.",
      "Officials in Europe, for example, are preparing for a double-digit tariff on their exports. Trump earlier this year said he planned to hit goods from the bloc with a 25% import tax.",
      "Which countries could be affected?",
      "The Trump administration has not confirmed which countries will be hit, although it has trailed Wednesday's announcement as a sweeping one.",
      "On Sunday, the president said the new tariffs could apply to \"all countries\", suggesting a possible return to the across-the-board tariff he backed in the campaign.",
      "It dashed hopes in some countries, such as the UK, that thought they might float under the radar, though many are still hoping eventually to work out some sort of deal.",
      "But it is still unclear to what extent the tariffs will be universally applied or more targeted.",
      "Last month, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said efforts were focused on the \"Dirty 15\" - the 15% of countries that account for the bulk of trade with the US and impose tariffs or other rules that put US firms at a disadvantage.",
      "The Office of the US Trade Representative, as it prepared to craft recommendations, identified the countries in which it was  \"particularly interested\".",
      "They were Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, the European Union, India, Indonesia, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, Russia, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Switzerland, Taiwan, Thailand, Turkey, the UK and Vietnam.",
      "Trump himself has reserved some of his harshest criticism for historic allies and major trade partners, such as Canada and the EU.",
      "\"Friend has been, oftentimes, much worse than foe,\" he declared last week.",
      "What impact will the tariffs have?",
      "Tariffs are taxes on imports. So the big question is, who will pay?",
      "Technically, there is a simple answer: the US firms bringing in the goods are the companies that will face the bill, especially if the White House starts levying the tariffs \"immediately\", as spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt suggested on Tuesday.",
      "But the larger the tariffs are, the more firms will be looking for ways to offset those costs, either by changing suppliers, pushing business partners to share the burden - or by raising prices for Americans.",
      "Many firms have said they are already preparing for that step. But it is a risky game because if companies raise prices too much, buyers will simply stay away.",
      "The dynamics have raised the risks of an economic recession both in the US - and far outside its borders, where many firms rely on US sales.",
      "Trump says companies looking to avoid tariffs can simply do their business in the US, but that's not an immediate, or easy fix, given the high costs of hiring and setting up factories.",
      "Introduce currency swings and retaliation by other countries into the mix, and the repercussions of Trump's bid to reset global trade balances are likely to prove hard to predict long after Wednesday's announcement."

One said Zou raped her in his hometown in China, after spiking her drink which left her conscious but unable to speak or move. The other said Zou drugged her too - in London - and that she had woken up to find him filming himself sexually assaulting her.",

      "\"Normally when you drink too much, you feel good for a while. But that night I just felt extremely dizzy and sleepy right away.\"",
      "Zou persuaded her it wouldn't be safe to take a taxi home in the state she was in, she told us, and asked her to take a nap in his bedroom. She says she agreed, knowing her friend was also still in the apartment.",
      "The next thing she says she remembers is waking up to Zou removing her trousers.",
      "\"I stopped him right away,\" she says - explaining how she then noticed a torchlight from a mobile phone above her head, and realised, to her horror, that he was filming her.",
      "Alice describes trying to leave his bedroom but being aggressively \"yanked back from the doorway\". Zou used such strong force to try to keep her in the bedroom, she says, that she \"had to cling on to the door frame with both hands\".",
      "It was only when she threatened to scream for help, that he let go - she told us - with Zou then telling her not to make \"a big deal\" of things, or to go to the police.",
      "Zou contacted Alice the next day on WeChat, she says, but he made no mention of the previous night. He asked her to dinner but she says she ignored him and they were never in touch again.",
      "Alice confided in a few close friends, but took things no further.",
      "\"I thought that, first, you needed evidence. And second, something substantial had to have happened before you could call the police.\"",
      "Alice says the next time she saw Zou's face was nearly four years later in the media - after he was charged by police.",
      "It is challenging for foreign nationals to report sexual crimes in the UK, says Sarah Yeh, a trustee at Southeast and East Asian Women's Association in London.",
      "\"It would be daunting for anyone [from] overseas to be traumatised by rape and then have to navigate the British legal system and the NHS, or even access the services provided for victims,\" she told us.",
      "They might not understand their rights or what resources are available to them - she says - as well as being concerned about repercussions, negative impacts on their studies, shame brought on themselves and their families, and potential legal challenges.",
      "About a year after Alice says she was assaulted, she discovered that one of her male friends in London also knew Zou, but had cut all contact because he found out Zou had been spiking women's drinks.",
      "The friend - who the BBC is calling Jie - told us he \"wasn't surprised at all\" when he heard Zou had been convicted.",
      "\"A lot of friends at the time probably knew [what Zou was doing]. I reckon some of our female friends knew too.\"",
      "Jie told us he accidentally drank from someone else's glass at a party in 2022, and then became \"unwell\" and \"very sleepy\". Zou then told him he had spiked the drink - says Jie - and had meant for a woman at the party to drink it.",
      "Jie says Zou later showed him a small bag of drugs and asked if he wanted to \"collaborate with him\". He says he took from this that Zou wanted his help finding girls whose drinks he could spike. Jie says he refused.",
      "The BBC asked Jie why he had initially continued to see Zou and why he didn't go to the police. Jie told us they both had lots of mutual friends so it was difficult not to socialise together. He says he did warn his friends about Zou, telling them not to hang out with him \"because he was drugging people\".",
      "Jie doesn't like thinking about those memories, he says, and that is why he hasn't gone to the police - adding that he had believed the women's testimonies were enough to convict Zou.",
      "Eventually, Jie says, he did cut all ties with him.",
      "Another young woman who has been in touch with police in London and China since Zou's trial is \"Rachel\". She says she was drugged and raped by him in 2022 in his hometown of Dongguan - in Guangdong province.",
      "Rachel told the BBC she had gone on a date with Zou, having met him online. She thought they were going to a bar, she says, but ended up at his home - a large villa which Zou had described as one of his family's many properties.",
      "With his back turned to her, she says Zou mixed her a green-coloured cocktail. They then started a drinking game, she says, and she experienced a \"wave of dizziness\". Rachel has told UK police that Zou took her up to a bedroom, where she became unable to speak or move her body, and then raped her.",
      "She thought about calling the police the next day, but decided against it. She feared it would be very difficult to prove non-consent. \"It's hard for me to prove the fact that I was willing to go to his place for drinks and that was not a signal that I was consenting to sex,\" she told us.",
      "She added that Dongguan is a small place and there was always a risk that people she knew - her parents, relatives and colleagues - would find out and think she was \"indiscreet\".",
      "Details of help and support with sexual violence are available at BBC Action Line",
      "Details of help and support with sexual violence are available at BBC Action Line",
      "We have seen Rachel's statement to UK police. She wants her story to be heard now, she says, to encourage more victims to come forward - and because she would like to see Zou prosecuted in China as well as the UK.",
      "Cdr Kevin Southworth - who leads public protection at the Metropolitan Police - told the BBC officers were still working their way through the 23 potential new cases and that some of the people were \"definitely not identical\" to those featured in Zou's seized secret footage or from the charge cases so far.",
      "\"It speaks to the fact that his offending group is actually far greater than we had realised,\" he says.",
      "A second trial for the convicted rapist has not been ruled out and there is \"certainly a case\" to discuss with the Crown Prosecution Service, given the numbers of women coming forward, he adds.",
      "'He wears a Rolex submariner watch'",
      "The BBC has also spoken to the only two victims who police were able to identify ahead of Zou's trial - both are Chinese nationals who had been studying in London. The women got to know each other on social media after one of them, who we are calling Beth, posted about her experience.",
      "Beth was raped by Zou in 2023 and had tried to report the crime to the Metropolitan Police soon afterwards. But then she decided not to pursue things because she felt unsure of UK law and had been left feeling discouraged after her initial interaction with the police, which included a poor translation of her 999 call.",
      "\"Back then I didn't know [Zou's name]. I didn't know his address, I could only give general information,\" she says.",
      "In frustration, Beth posted a warning on social media about what had happened to her. Another Chinese student, \"Clara\", says she \"immediately\" knew this was the same man who had drugged and raped her after a night out in London's Chinatown, two years before.",
      "Every detail in Beth's post pointed to the same man, says Clara: \"He has a Guangdong accent, he looks honest and he wears a Rolex submariner watch.\"",
      "The women began to speak online and Beth encouraged Clara to report what had happened to her to the police.",
      "Months later, police contacted Beth to say they were re-investigating the case. Clara had come forward.",
      "On Zou's seized devices, police had also found a video featuring Beth.",
      "The Met has since expressed regret over how it initially handled her allegations.",
      "\"We want to avoid situations where victims feel like they're maybe not being taken seriously, or heaven forbid, being disbelieved,\" says Cdr Southworth. Additional training is now being rolled out to all front line officers, he says.",
      "Clara describes a positive experience with British police. She says she didn't want to fly to London for the trial, in case her parents found out, so the Met sent two officers to China to support her as she gave evidence by video instead.",
      "The officers were assisted by the Chinese authorities, who have been working collaboratively with the Met and are \"very supportive\", says Cdr Southworth.",
      "\"I hope that can give some encouragement to victim-survivors, wherever they are in the world, that you are safe to come forward.\"",
      "Beth - who gave her evidence in court in London - says it was only afterwards that she realised that she and Clara were the only two women to have helped convict Zou.",
      "\"I thought for a long time that I wasn't an important part of the case against Zou,\" she says.",
      "Now she is glad she testified and is encouraging other women to come forward.",

      "Eyewitnesses in Sagaing have told the BBC that the road where the mosques were, Myoma Street, was the worst hit in the city. Many other houses on the street have also collapsed.",
      "Hundreds of people have sought shelter by the side of the road, either because they are now homeless, or are too afraid to go back to their homes in case there are aftershocks. Food supplies are reported to be scarce.",
      "In Myoma alone, more than 60 people were said to be crushed in the collapse, while scores more died in the Myodaw and Moekya mosques. More bodies were still being pulled out on Tuesday.",
      "There are indications that the worshippers had tried to escape, according to Soe Nay Oo, who has received multiple reports from surviving members of his community.",
      "He currently lives in the Thai city of Mae Sot with his wife and daughter, after escaping from Myanmar soon after a coup that took place in 2021.",
      "There were bodies found outside of the main prayer hall, he said, in the area where worshippers wash themselves. Some were also found clutching other people's hands, in what looked like attempts to pull them away from the crumbling building.",
      "Among the many loved ones Soe Nay Oo lost was one of his wife's cousins. Her death, he said, was \"the most painful thing that I have endured\" in his 13 years as an imam.",

    "story": [
      "French far-right leader Jordan Bardella has called on people to rally in the centre of Paris on Sunday in protest at a ruling that has banned Marine Le Pen from running for public office for five years.",
      "Le Pen's bid to become France's next president in 2027 was dealt a dramatic blow on Monday, when judges said she had been at the heart of an operation which saw the embezzlement of \u20ac2.9m ($3.4m; \u00a32.5m) of EU funds between 2004 and 2016.",
      "Bardella, the president of the National Rally (RN) party, said the French had to be \"outraged\" by the sentence.",
      "The Paris Court of Appeal said on Tuesday it should be able to provide a decision on the case by the summer of 2026 - several months ahead of the 2027 election.",
      "\"We'll take to the streets this weekend,\" Bardella said during a press conference on Tuesday, with a call for \"democratic, peaceful, calm mobilisations\". The first event is planned for Place Vauban close to the Eiffel Tower on Sunday.",
      "Sitting beside him, Le Pen said a \"nuclear bomb\" had been used against the RN to stop the party getting into power.",
      "The longtime figurehead of the French far right added that the \"system\" had used a \"powerful weapon\" against the RN, \"evidently because we are about to win the elections\".",
      "\"We won't let them get away with it,\" she added. People had to use their \"outrage and hurt\" to motivate them to persevere: \"We will hold on until the end, until victory.\"",
      "Earlier on Tuesday, Bardella condemned the \"tyranny of the judges\" and said that \"everything was being done to stop us from getting to power\".",
      "He also criticised the insults that the judges have received since handing down the sentence on Monday, as did Le Pen, who said any threats to magistrates were \"unacceptable\".",
      "They were echoing R\u00e9my Heitz, the prosecutor general at the Court of Cassation - the highest court in France - who said earlier on Tuesday that there had been \"very personalised attacks\" and threats against the three judges who had determined Monday's verdicts.",
      "Citing a police source, newspaper Le Figaro reported that B\u00e9n\u00e9dicte de Perthuis, the president judge in the Le Pen case, had been placed under protection following threats.",
      "Le Pen was gearing up to run for the presidency for a fourth time and had a good chance of winning. She is clearly reluctant to hand the baton to Jordan Bardella, who at 29 is seen by some as lacking the experience necessary to hold France's highest office.",
      "Since she has been ruled ineligible, Le Pen has said she will not \"let herself be eliminated like this\". Bardella has steered clear of being drawn into the discussion at this stage, refusing to say whether he was National Rally's \"plan B\".",
      "However, RN spokesman Laurent Jacobelli said that although the party would fight to have Le Pen as candidate, Bardella was \"the most naturally legitimate\" alternative.",
      "Voters may agree. A poll published a day before Le Pen was sentenced showed that around 60% of RN voters would back Bardella over Le Pen at the presidential election if he were to run, and that he would come out top with up to 36% of the total vote.",
      "Le Pen has garnered the support of several rightwingers in Europe and beyond, including Hungary's Viktor Orban and US President Donald Trump, who said her conviction was a \"very big deal\".",
      "And Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni said \"no-one who cares about democracy can rejoice at a sentence that... deprives millions of citizens of representation\".",
      "On top of the ban on running for public office, Le Pen was also handed a \u20ac100,000 (\u00a382,635) fine and four-year prison sentence, of which two will be suspended.",
      "This will not apply until the appeals process is exhausted, which could take several years.",

      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has denounced an investigation into possible links between his aides and Qatar as a \"witch hunt\", after he gave testimony to police.",
      "An adviser and a former spokesman were arrested on Monday over alleged payments from the Gulf Arab state as part of the probe, which has been dubbed \"Qatar-gate\". They have denied any wrongdoing.",

      "A Qatari official also dismissed the probe as a \"smear campaign\" against Qatar, which has played a key role as a mediator between Israel and Hamas during the war in Gaza.",
      "It comes as Netanyahu faces escalating protests in Israel over his policies, including the resumption of Israel's offensive against Hamas before securing the release of all the remaining hostages, the dismissal of the director of the Shin Bet internal security agency, and the advancement of a controversial plan to overhaul the judiciary.",

      "Israeli media reports subsequently identified them as Yonatan Urich, a very close adviser to Netanyahu, and Eli Feldstein, a former spokesman in the prime minister's office, and said they were suspected of contact with a foreign agent, money laundering, bribery, fraud, and breach of trust.",
      "Netanyahu later cut short an appearance at his separate trial on corruption charges, which he denies, to provide recorded testimony to police investigating the case at his office in Jerusalem.",
      "After being questioned, Netanyahu posted a video online in which he condemned both the arrests and the wider investigation.",
      "\"I understood that it was a political investigation but I didn't realise how political it was,\" he said. \"They are holding Jonatan Urich and Eli Feldstein as hostages, making their lives miserable over nothing.\"",
      "\"There is no case, there is absolutely nothing, just a political witch hunt, nothing else.\"",
      "The prime minister's Likud party also issued a statement accusing the attorney general's office and the Shin Bet chief of \"fabricating\" the case and attempting to \"terrorise Yonatan Urich in order to extract from him false testimony against the prime minister through blackmail\".",
      "On Tuesday, a judge at Rishon LeZion Magistrates' Court extended Urich and Feldstein's detention by three days, saying there were \"reasonable suspicions\" that required a thorough investigation. The police had requested a nine-day extension.",
      "Judge Menahem Mizrahi said in a decision that investigators suspected that the two men had acted to \"promote Qatar in a positive light\" and \"spread negative messages about Egypt\" and its role as another mediator in the Gaza ceasefire talks.",
      "For this purpose, the judge said, a \"business and economic connection\" was created between a US lobbying firm working for Qatar \"through the mediation of [Urich] in return for monetary payments which were passed to [Feldstein]\" through an Israeli businessman.",
      "Last week, Israeli media published a recording in which the businessman was heard saying that he had transferred funds to Feldstein on behalf of a US lobbyist working for Qatar.",
      "At the time, Feldstein's lawyers said the payments were \"for strategic and communications services Feldstein provided to the prime minister's office, not for Qatar\". They also said Feldstein was not aware of any connection between the businessman and other parties, including Qatar. Ulrich's lawyers said he denied involvement.",
      "A police representative told Judge Mizrahi on Tuesday that Urich was also suspected of passing journalists messages from a source linked to Qatar, which were presented as if they came from senior Israeli political or security officials.",
      "Ulrich's legal team, which includes Netanyahu's defence lawyer Amit Hadad, said they would submit a request to lift the gag order on the case to expose \"the injustice done to him\". The judge went on to approve the request, saying the gag order had been repeatedly violated.",
      "A Qatari official told the Financial Times: \"This is not the first time we have been the subject of a smear campaign by those who do not want to see an end to this conflict [the Gaza war] or the remaining hostages returned to their families.\"",
      "Qatar has long championed the Palestinian cause and host political leaders of Hamas, which is proscribed as a terrorist organisation by Israel, the UK, the US and other countries.",
      "Between 2018 and the start of the current war, which was triggered by Hamas's 7 October 2023 attack on Israel, the Gulf state provided hundreds of millions of dollars of aid for Gaza.",
      "Israeli governments allowed the money to be transferred to pay the wages of civil servants in Gaza's Hamas-run government, support the poorest families, and fund fuel deliveries for the territory's sole power plant. However, critics asserted that it was helping Hamas to stay in power and fund its military activities.",
      "Since the war, Qatar has helped, along with the US and Egypt, to broker two ceasefire and hostage release deals between Israel and Hamas.",
      "The most recent lasted between 19 January and 18 March, when Israel renewed its air and ground campaign, blaming Hamas for rejecting a new US proposal for an extension and the release of its 59 remaining hostages. Hamas accused Israel of violating the original deal.",
      "Netanyahu claimed that the \"sole purpose\" of the Qatar-gate investigation was to prevent the dismissal of the director of the Shin Bet domestic security agency, which has been participating in the probe, and to \"topple a right-wing prime minister\".",
      "The government fired Ronen Bar on 21 March, saying it had lost trust in him over the failure to prevent Hamas's deadly attack on Israel on 7 October 2023, which triggered the war in Gaza.",
      "However, the supreme court suspended the dismissal pending a hearing on 8 April in response to petitions from opposition political parties and a non-governmental organisation, which said the move was made for inappropriate reasons and constituted a severe conflict of interest.",

    "story": [
      "As Ukrainian cities are bombed almost nightly by Russia, the idea of holding elections here might seem fanciful.",
      "But in the streets and offices of the capital, Kyiv, the prospect of the country going to the polls is once again being discussed.",
      "Election rumours have come and gone in the three long years of Russia's full-scale war.",
      "Each time they have been dismissed by government, opposition and public alike, arguing unity of effort against the Russian invader must come first.",
      "A presidential election due in 2024 was suspended in line with martial law, which was introduced in Ukraine following Russia's full-scale invasion two years earlier.",
      "But that hasn't stopped the Kremlin from claiming President Volodymyr Zelensky is an illegitimate leader and demanding new elections as a condition of a ceasefire deal \u2013 a talking point which has been repeated by President Trump.",
      "BBC Verify on why elections in Ukraine were suspended",
      "BBC Verify on why elections in Ukraine were suspended",
      "Now there has been a fresh flurry of speculation that Zelensky might just be thinking again as ceasefire talks proceed, and some sources speaking to the BBC suggest there are reasons to think elections could go ahead later this year.",
      "The president's potential closest rival, Valerii Zaluzhnyi, former commander in chief of Ukraine's army, has felt the need to deny rumours about his intentions.",
      "\"My answer to this has not changed,\" he told the RBC-Ukraine news agency. \"While the war continues, we all need to work to save the country, not think about elections. I don't comment on any rumours.\"",
      "That the publicity-shy Zaluzhnyi, currently Ukraine's ambassador in London, felt the need to issue a statement was striking in itself.",
      "The head of Ukraine's Central Election Commission, Oleh Didenko, also chose to speak publicly about the speculation.",
      "He told the Ukrainska Pravda news website the law would have to be changed before any elections could take place. He said current rules stated that parliamentary elections must be held 60 days after the lifting of martial law, and 90 days for presidential elections.",
      "But more time would be needed because of the war and that would require legal changes.",
      "The Economist newspaper claimed Zelensky held a meeting last week to discuss an election and instructed staff to prepare for a vote once the United States had forced Russia into accepting a ceasefire, potentially as early as Easter.",
      "This report was denied by several government sources.",
      "\"There is fake information there,\" one presidential source told BBC News Ukrainian. \"There was no such meeting and there was no such instruction.\"",
      "The government source said the main focus was achieving peace and there was little hope of the war ending by Easter.",
      "So in the face of so many public denials, why do some still think an election might be in the offing?",
      "First, some sources note Zelensky's support in the polls has picked up since he was harangued by Donald Trump and Vice-President JD Vance in the White House.",
      "A poll by the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology (KIIS) in March suggested the number of Ukrainians who trusted Zelensky was up a couple of points on the previous month at 69%.",
      "Diplomats say the president might think now was his best chance of winning a second term rather than wait until political divisions emerge after the war.",
      "Second, by winning a second term, Zelensky would call Russia's bluff and strengthen his hand in any long-term peace negotiations. Only last week President Vladimir Putin said the United Nations should take over Ukraine and organise a \"democratic presidential election\". His assumption \u2013 perhaps mistaken - is that Zelensky would be replaced.",
      "Third, martial law must be renewed by parliamentary vote in early May. Zelensky could use that timetable to announce martial law would be allowed to lapse with elections held later in the summer.",
      "Fourth, the Americans are convinced elections are coming. Steve Witkoff, President Trump's special envoy, told the Tucker Carlson podcast on March 21: \"They've agreed to it. There will be elections in Ukraine.\"",
      "Zelensky could use this pressure from the US \u2013 echoing Russian narratives \u2013 as a pretext, telling voters he had no choice but to hold elections.",
      "Fifth, some Ukrainian sources believe logistical obstacles to elections can be overcome.",
      "Millions of citizens are displaced overseas, on the front line and in occupied territories. The answer to that, some say, is to allow people to vote using a smart phone app called Diia. This contains people's core documents such as passport, identity card and drivers' licence.",
      "Using Diia, some argue, would allow people to vote quickly, cheaply and safely without having to travel to a polling booth overseas or in the trenches. They point out Ukrainians have used it successfully to vote in the Eurovision Song Contest. They also note President Zelensky gave every Ukrainian almost \u00a320 as a winter allowance last December, with many registering for it using Diia.",
      "But there remain many arguments against elections.",
      "Using Diia would require new legislation that might struggle to get through parliament. Diia could be vulnerable to cyber-attack and technical failure. Western governments may not consider it trustworthy; Russia certainly would not.",
      "Even if Diia were used, identifying who could vote would still take time with incomplete and out-of-date registers.",
      "Lifting martial law during a temporary ceasefire could create unexpected consequences \u2013 including the flight of hundreds of thousands of soldiers from the front line \u2013 just as Russia prepared a counterattack. Russia could strike queues of voters at polling stations.",
      "Any elections, however quickly held, would allow war-time unity to be replaced by political rows. An election would allow Russia to deploy digital and other propaganda to try to shape the result.",
      "Holding an election may also be seen as accepting Russian arguments that Volodymyr Zelensky's leadership is illegitimate because of the suspended elections last year.",
      "Perhaps the strongest argument against elections is that Ukrainians themselves do not want them. That same March poll by the KIIS found about 78% of people opposed holding elections even after a complete settlement of the war."

      "The other is that Weil, despite running in a district Trump carried by more than 30 points last November, just might win. And if he does, Democrats would take a big step closer to a majority in the narrowly divided House.",
      "Win or lose, the race also could serve as a barometer of voters' motivation as Trump begins his second term \u2013 and offer hints at the political landscape ahead of next year's mid-term congressional elections.",
      "It is one of two special elections in Florida on Tuesday. The other, in Florida's panhandle region, will determine a replacement for Matt Gaetz, the firebrand congressman Trump originally picked to be attorney general before he withdrew  under a cloud of sexual misconduct and ethics allegations. A Republican is widely expected to win there.",
      "But that is not the case here. Weil has raised about $10m in campaign donations, dwarfing the $1m brought in by Fine, a Florida state senator.",
      "According to a recent public opinion survey, Weil narrowly trails Fine. An internal poll by a respected Republican firm reportedly showed Weil ahead by 3.",
      "That's enough to cause more than a little anxiety in Republican ranks.",
      "\"There's no excuse for a Republican not to win this race,\" said Randy Ross, a Florida-based conservative activist who campaigned there for Trump in 2016 and 2024. \"The only excuse that can possibly be had is Republicans weren't excited and didn't get out to vote.\"",
      "Mr Ross added that Republican voters need to understand that Fine will support Trump's agenda in Congress \u2013 and Weil will not.",
      "To this end, some of the party's heaviest hitters stepped in to help. Last Thursday, Trump joined the Republican candidate in two telephone town hall events. On Monday night, Florida Congressman Byron Donalds and conservative commentator Ben Shapiro held their own event.",
      "\"Donald Trump's agenda is hanging by a thread,\" Shapiro said. \"This is a district that simply cannot fall into Democratic hands.\"",

      "Of particular concern for the party is that special elections take place during times of lower political engagement and usually involve only the one race in question. They often tilt toward the party with the most enthusiasm, according to Mr Ross. For Republicans, a Democratic show of strength on Tuesday would be troubling.",
      "\"You can't go just on name recognition in a special election,\" he said. \"You've got to drive people out to vote for you.\"",
      "Republican nervousness is a result of simple math in the House of Representatives. With a 218 to 213 majority in the 435 seat chamber, the party cannot afford to lose any winnable elections \u2013 let alone ones that should be a slam dunk.",
      "While a Weil victory alone wouldn't be enough to flip control of the chamber, two of the currently vacant seats are in safely Democratic districts. If the results of those special elections go as expected, Democrats would be on the verge of control.",
      "That could explain why the president announced on Friday he was withdrawing his pick of New York Congresswoman Elise Stefanik to be US ambassador to the United Nations, despite her having all but formally vacated her office. A Weil victory on Tuesday would mean the Republicans could not afford to lose a New York election to replace Stefanik.",
      "Even before Tuesday's balloting, both Democrats and Republicans jockeyed to frame the results in the best light for their party.",
      "Conservatives downplayed the national implications of the race and placed blame on Fine, who has been accused of running a lacklustre campaign and taking victory for granted.",
      "\"It's a reflection of the candidate that's running the race, \" Republican Florida Governor Ron DeSantis said of Fine's apparent underperformance.",
      "Meanwhile, Democrats are declaring a victory \u2013 at least, the moral variety.",
      "\"These are races that should not, under ordinary circumstances, be on anyone's political radar,\" Democratic House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries said last Monday. \"The American people are not buying what the Republicans are selling.\"",
      "That sentiment was echoed by many of Weil's supporters on Monday night in Ocala, even if the candidate himself told the BBC he would win by eight points.",
      "\"If we lose but come close, moderate Republicans might take notice,\" said Buddy Oswald, an attorney and educator. If they were worried their party could lose a safe seat, he added, maybe they would feel the heat and be more willing to break with the president.",
      "Eight years ago, in the aftermath of Trump's stunning 2016 presidential victory, Democrats sought solace in special election races across the map. They pulled off some stunners, including a Doug Jones Senate victory in deeply conservative Alabama. In other races, such as a bid by Jon Ossoff in a suburban Atlanta district, the Democrat came up just short.",
      "Those races presaged a high level of Democratic enthusiasm that led to a wave in the mid-terms the following year, when the party won 39 seats in taking back the House of Representatives and putting a decisive end to Trump's first-term legislative agenda.",
      "Republicans, with convincing victories on Tuesday, want to squelch any chance of history repeating itself.",

      "Srija and Arun's attempt to register their 2018 wedding was rejected, with the registrar arguing that the 1955 Hindu Marriage Act defined marriage as a union between a \"bride\" and a \"groom\", which therefore excluded trans women.",
      "But the couple, backed by LGBT activists, pushed back, taking their relationship into the public domain. The effort was worth it.",
      "They received global attention in 2019 when the Madras High Court in Chennai upheld their right to marry, stating that transgender people should be recognised as either a \"bride\" or \"groom\" as defined by the 1955 Hindu Marriage Act.",
      "The ruling was seen by LGBT activists as a pivotal step in the acceptance of transgender people in India, with Srija and Arun both becoming well known locally for challenging cultural norms.",
      "But media coverage also invited negative scrutiny.",
      "\"The day after local news coverage, I was fired from my job,\" says Arun, who worked as a manual labourer in the transport sector. He believes it was due to transphobia.",
      "Online trolling followed.",
      "\"People sent abusive messages criticising me for being married to a transgender woman,\" he says.",
      "The couple briefly separated under the strain.",
      "Despite this, Srija excelled at her education, frequently coming first in class at high school.",
      "She went on to complete a degree in English literature from a university in Tamil Nadu, becoming one of the only people in her family to receive higher education.",
      "It's a source of pride for Valli, who left school aged 14.",
      "Even before battling to have her marriage recognised by the state, Srija and her family faced hostility and mistreatment.",
      "After Srija came out as a transgender woman at the age of 17, she and her mother and younger brother, China, were evicted from their home by their landlord.",
      "Several family members stopped speaking to them.",
      "But Srija's mother and brother were steadfast in their support.",
      "\"I will always stand by my daughter,\" says Valli.",
      "\"All trans people should be supported by their family.\"",
      "Valli, who became a single parent when her husband died when Srija was just six, works in a kitchen at a school.",
      "But despite earning a modest income, she helped pay for her daughter's gender reassignment, in part by selling some of her jewellery, and cared for her afterwards.",
      "\"She takes good care of me,\" Srija says.",
      "'Hopefully mindsets will change'",
      "There are thought to be about two million transgender people in India, the world's most populous country, although activists say the number is higher.",
      "While the country has passed trans-inclusive legislation and recognised in law a \"third gender\", stigma and discrimination remain.",
      "Studies have found transgender people in India face high rates of abuse, mental health issues, and limited access to education, employment, and healthcare. Many are forced to beg or enter sex work.",
      "Globally, the UN says significant numbers of transgender people face rejection from their families.",
      "\"Not a lot of trans people in India, or even the world, have the support of their families,\" says filmmaker, Shiva Krish.",
      "\"Srija and Valli's story is unique.\"",
      "Srija says she hopes the film will help challenge stereotypes about trans people and the types of stories that are often promoted in the media about the group - especially those that focus on trauma and abuse.",
      "\"This documentary shows that we can be leaders. I am a manager, a productive member of the workforce,\" Srija says.",
      "\"When people see new kinds of stories on trans people, hopefully their mindsets will also change.\"",
      "'I'd like to become a grandmother soon'",
      "After premiering at international film festivals, Amma's Pride was shown at a special screening in Chennai, for members of the LGBT community and allies, to mark International Trans Day of Visibility on Monday 31 March.",
      "Following the Chennai screening, a workshop was held where participants in small groups discussed family acceptance and community support for trans individuals.",
      "\"We hope our screening events will foster connections between trans individuals, their families, and local communities,\" adds Chithra Jeyaram, another one of the filmmakers behind Amma's Pride.",
      "The Amma's Pride production team hope that the universal themes of family support in the face of stigma means the documentary and workshops can be rolled out to rural audiences, as well as other cities in India, and neighbouring countries like Nepal and Bangladesh.",
      "As for Srija and Arun, they now work as managers for private companies and hope to adopt a child soon. \"We're hoping for a normal future,\" says Srija.",

    "story": [
      "\"Incredible.\" That was the single word uttered under her breath by Marine Le Pen as she stormed out of a Paris courtroom on Monday morning.",
      "She left the court early \u2013 just before hearing that she was barred from running for office for five years after being found guilty of embezzlement of EU funds \u2013 almost certainly ruling her out from standing in the 2027 French presidential election.",
      "Without even waiting for the judge to pronounce the full details of the sentence, the head of the National Rally knew that her political goose was cooked.",
      "There would be no reprieve pending appeal. The bar on running for office was real and immediate.",
      "A four-year prison sentence, of which two will be suspended, will be on hold pending appeal.",
      "But her political plans are dead.",
      "Le Pen's incredulity can be better excused, perhaps, in the context of the moment.",
      "A consensus had almost established itself across France's political world that this ultimate sanction by the court could not, would not \u2013 in the end \u2013 take place.",
      "It was not just Le Pen's followers who said it. Her enemies agreed, from Jean-Luc Melenchon on the far left to Prime Minister Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou in the centre and Justice Minister G\u00e9rard Darmanin on the right.",
      "Le Pen attacks ban from running for public office as 'political decision'",
      "Marine Le Pen hits back in EU funds misuse trial",
      "But they were all wrong.  The judge said that the law was the law.",
      "The law had in fact recently been toughened \u2013 by the very politicians who were now complaining about its application \u2013 to make the penalty for misuse of public funds very severe indeed.  Well, said the judge in so many words, now let politicians suck up their own medicine.",
      "Maybe Marine Le Pen was naive in not predicting this outcome. It certainly appears as if her National Rally party was singularly unprepared for it.",
      "So as they met in an emergency session after the verdict, party leaders were in a dilemma.",
      "Do they continue as if there is still a chance Marine Le Pen will run in 2027?",
      "In theory there is still a (small) possibility.  She has launched an appeal. The appeal could be accelerated and take place at the end of this year or early 2026. A verdict would follow in the spring.",
      "A different decision at the appeal hearing could lessen the period of ineligibility, or remove it altogether \u2013 in which case she could still run.  But the chances must be regarded as slim.",
      "Or, should they proceed with plan B \u2013 that is to say, with naming party president Jordan Bardella as de facto the man who will run in Marine Le Pen's place?",
      "That might be a more realistic assessment of what lies ahead. But to turn to Bardella too quickly would be unseemly.  And anyway, not everyone in the party is a fan.",
      "By the evening the choice had been made: in a TV appearance Marine Le Pen came out fighting, saying she had no plans to retreat from the political scene.",
      "Denouncing what she called a \"political\" decision by the judge and a \"violation of the state of law\", she called for a swift appeal trial, so that her name could be cleared \u2013 or at least the ineligibility lifted \u2013 in time for the 2027 vote.",
      "\"There are millions of French people who believe in me. For 30 years I have been fighting against injustice. It is what I shall continue to do right to the end,\" she said.",
      "Fighting words \u2013 but in reality the future looks very unclear. And there are many unanswered questions.",
      "What, for example, will the effect of the court decision be on the RN vote?",
      "In the short term we can expect an outcry, and a boost to the party's support.  Why? Because what has happened fits so neatly into the RN narrative that the populist right is a victim of the \"system\".",
      "No-one likely to vote for the RN seriously holds it against Marine Le Pen for illegally financing her party using EU parliament funds.  They all know that practically every French political party has resorted to similar underhand methods in the past.",
      "By the same token,  her \"draconian\" punishment \u2013 being banned from standing for the presidency \u2013 will be interpreted as a badge of honour: proof that she alone is standing up to the powers-that-be.",
      "Longer term, though, the boost may not be so powerful.  The truth is that Marine Le Pen is a huge asset to the RN.  This battle-hardened, sentimental, cat-loving,  tough-talking,  long-suffering woman is held in affection by her supporters, who feel they know her personally.",
      "Jordan Bardella is a popular figure too, but at just 29 it is hard to see him filling her shoes. If Marine Le Pen is indeed unable to run in 2027, the RN loses much of its appeal.",
      "What is certain is that many would-be candidates on the non-RN right \u2013 Laurent Wauquiez, Bruno Retailleau for example \u2013 would see in a Bardella candidacy a big opportunity for themselves.",
      "The other unknown is vengeance.",
      "Marine Le Pen remains a member of the National Assembly, where she leads a bloc of 125 \u2013 the parliament's biggest.  Till now she had been benign towards the beleaguered prime minister Francois Bayrou, who struggles on despite having no majority.",
      "Those days may be over.",
      "Why should we do anyone any favours now, they will be saying at RN HQ. Why not bring the house down?",

    "published": "Mon, 31 Mar 2025 12:52:20 GMT",
    "summary": "The size of the earthquake and the length of the fault line it occurred on contributed to the devastation.",
    "story": [
      "A major earthquake in Myanmar on Friday has caused more than 2,000 deaths and led to the collapse of numerous structures.",
      "Even though the south-east Asian nation is a high risk region for earthquakes, neighbouring Thailand and China - which were also affected by the quake - are not.",
      "The Thai capital, Bangkok, sits more than 1,000km (621 miles) from the epicentre of Friday's earthquake - and yet an unfinished high-rise building in the city was felled by it.",
      "Here we will explain what caused this earthquake, and how it was able to have such a powerful effect so far away.",
      "Follow updates on this story",
      "Follow updates on this story",
      "What caused the earthquake?",
      "The earth's upper layer is split into different sections, called tectonic plates, which are all moving constantly. Some move alongside each other, whilst others are above and below each other.",
      "It is this movement that causes earthquakes and volcanoes.",
      "Myanmar is considered to be one of the most geologically \"active\" areas in the world because it sits on top of the convergence of four of these tectonic plates - the Eurasian plate, the Indian plate, the Sunda plate and the Burma microplate.",
      "The Himalayas were formed by the Indian plate colliding with the Eurasian plate, and the 2004 Tsunami as a result of the Indian plate moving beneath the Burma microplate.",
      "Dr Rebecca Bell, a reader in tectonics at Imperial College London, said that to accommodate all of this motion, faults - cracks in the rock - form which allow tectonic plates to \"slither\" sideways.",
      "There is a major fault called the Sagaing fault, which cuts right through Myanmar north to south and is more than 1,200km (746 miles) long.",
      "Early data suggests that the movement that caused Friday's 7.7-magnitude earthquake was a \"strike-slip\" - where two blocks move horizontally along each other.",
      "This aligns with the movement typical of the Sagaing fault.",
      "As the plates move past each other, they can become stuck, building friction until it is suddenly released and the earth shifts, causing an earthquake.",
      "Why was the earthquake felt so far away?",
      "Earthquakes can happen at up to 700km (435 miles) below the surface. This one was just 10km from the surface, making it very shallow. This increases the amount of shaking at the surface.",
      "The earthquake was also very large - measuring 7.7 on the moment scale. It produced more energy than the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima, according to the US Geological Survey.",
      "The size of the quake was because of the type of fault, said Dr Bell.",
      "\"The straight nature [of the fault] means earthquakes can rupture over large areas - and the larger the area of the fault that slips, the larger the earthquake,\" she explained.",
      "\"There have been six magnitude 7 or greater earthquakes in this region in the last century.\"",
      "This straight fault also means a lot of the energy can be carried down its length - which extends for 1,200km south towards Thailand.",
      "When it comes to why the earth shook so much, scientists believe it is because the quake was a rare \"super shear\" - meaning energy from the rupture in the earth's crust built up because it was moving faster than seismic waves can travel through the earth.",
      "Seismologist Prof Frederik Tilmann, from the Helmholtz Centre for Geosciences in Germany, explained in analysis shared online that the rupture travelled at a speed of about 5km per second - making it \"the earthquake equivalent of a supersonic jet\".",
      "Because the fracture \"unzipped\" towards the south, it also directed this piled up energy towards the Thai capital, Bangkok, and this is why the earthquake had such an impact so far away.",
      "How earthquakes are felt at the surface is also determined by the type of soil.",
      "In soft soil - which is what Bangkok is built on - seismic waves (the vibrations of the earth) slow down and build up, getting bigger in size.",
      "So, Bangkok's geology would have made the ground shaking more intense.",
      "Why did just one skyscraper collapse in Bangkok?",
      "While dramatic footage has emerged of high-rise buildings in Bangkok swaying during the quake - knocking water from rooftop pools - the unfinished headquarters for the auditor-general's office Bangkok's Chatuchak district appears to be the only skyscraper to collapse.",
      "Prior to 2009, Bangkok did not have a comprehensive safety standard for constructing buildings to withstand earthquakes, according to Dr Christian M\u00e1laga-Chuquitaype, a senior lecturer in earthquake engineering at Imperial College London.",
      "This means that older buildings would have been particularly vulnerable.",
      "This is not unusual, as earthquake-resistant buildings can be more expensive to construct and Thailand, unlike Myanmar, does not frequently experience earthquakes.",
      "Dr Emily So, a professor of architectural engineering at the University of Cambridge, noted that older buildings can and have been strengthened, such as in California, western Canada and New Zealand.",
      "Prof Amorn Pimarnmas, president of the Structural Engineers Association of Thailand, said that while there were regulations in 43 provinces on earthquake-proofing buildings, less than 10% of buildings are estimated to be quake-resistant.",
      "Yet the building that collapsed was new - in fact, it was still under construction when the earthquake hit - and the updated building standards would have applied.",
      "Dr Pimarnmas said Bangkok's soft soil may have also played a part in its collapse, as it can amplify ground motions three or four times over.",
      "He added: \"However, there are other assumptions such as material (concrete and reinforcements) quality and some irregularity in [the] structural system. These remain to be investigated in detail.\"",
      "Having studied the video, Dr M\u00e1laga-Chuquitaype said it appears a \"flat slab\" construction process was being favoured - which is no longer recommended in earthquake-prone areas.",
      "\"A 'flat slab' system is a way of constructing buildings where floors are made to rest directly on columns, without using beams,\" he explained.",
      "\"Imagine a table supported only by legs, with no extra horizontal supports underneath.",
      "\"While this design has cost and architectural advantages, is performs poorly during earthquakes, often failing in a brittle and sudden (almost explosive) manner.\"",

      "Myanmar earthquake: What we know",
      "BBC reporter on desperate search for survivors in rubble of 30-storey building",
      "What about the buildings in Myanmar?",
      "Mandalay in Myanmar was much closer to where the ground slipped and would have experienced significantly more severe shaking than Bangkok.",
      "Although Myanmar regularly experiences earthquakes, Dr Ian Watkinson, a lecturer in earth sciences at Royal Holloway University, thought it was unlikely that many buildings were constructed to be earthquake-proof.",
      "\"General poverty, major political upheaval, alongside other disasters - e.g. the Indian Ocean tsunami in 2004 - has distracted the country from concentrating on the unpredictable risks from earthquakes,\" he said.",
      "\"This means that, in many cases, building design codes are not enforced, and construction happens in areas that could be prone to enhanced seismic risk, for example flood plains and steep slopes.\"",
      "Parts of Mandalay and its buildings also lie along the floodplain of the Ayerwaddy River. This makes them very vulnerable to a process called liquefaction.",
      "This happens when the soil has a high water content, and the shaking causes the sediment to lose its strength and behave like a liquid. This increases the risk of landslides and building collapses, as the ground can no longer hold them up.",
      "Dr So warned that there was \"always a chance\" of further damage to buildings near a fault line due to aftershocks - tremors that follow an earthquake, which can be caused by the sudden transfer of energy into nearby rock.",

    "story": [
      "President Trump is taking center stage at the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington, D.C. \"We are going to make a lot of changes,\" he said earlier this month, \"including the seats, the decor, pretty much everything. It needs a lot of work.\"",
      "He's directing many of those changes as the new chairman of the board. Out are all of President Joe Biden's appointees, replaced with Trump allies.",
      "The Trump White House says an overhaul is needed because the marquee arts center is, in their words, \"woke \u2026 and broke.\"",
      "Last month, Deborah Rutter was fired as president of the Kennedy Center after serving for more than a decade. Asked whether the arts institution is broke, Rutter replied, \"The Kennedy Center has the most complicated financial model, and that is true of every nonprofit arts organization.\"",
      "It has a budget of $268 million, with $43 million coming from the federal government. In 2023, the Kennedy Center had a $6 million surplus, even though it is not supposed to be a money-making enterprise. \"We're a nonprofit organization,\" Rutter said. \"It's not intended to make money.\"",
      "Its budget comes mostly from donations. Billionaire businessman and former chairman David Rubenstein has given more than $100 million. He, too, was fired last month. Rutter said, \"To have us both leaving at the same time does cause me some worry, because of the sense of understanding of structure, decision-making, how we go about interpreting our mission, all of those kinds of things.\"",
      "The Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts was founded in 1971 as a national cultural center and memorial to President John F. Kennedy. Its annual honors ceremony, which airs on CBS, features the best in music, theater and dance.",
      "But now, conservatives charge the center is \"too liberal,\" highlighting three drag events last year, including a \"Broadway Drag Brunch.\"",
      "Asked whether it was a mistake to host drag shows, Rutter replied, \"I don't think so. I believe that everybody in America has the opportunity to be seen, and to be seen at your national cultural center.\"",
      "She pointed out that the shows Trump referred to in a social media post (\"THIS WILL STOP,\" he promised) represented just three of the 2,000 performances that took place at the Kennedy Center last year.",
      "Asked why the focus was on three drag shows, Rutter replied, \"I can't actually imagine. Drag has been around for centuries. Shakespeare performed in drag, the original Shakespeare.\"",
      "President Trump boycotted the Kennedy Center Honors during his first term, after criticism from honorees like Norman Lear. So, what does the new chairman have planned now? In audio obtained by \"CBS Sunday Morning,\" he suggests a new host \u2013 himself:",
      "\"The king of ratings, right? Whether we like it or not, the king of ratings! So, if I was the host of the Honors, and we'll go slightly more conservative, if you don't mind, with some of the people\u2026\"",
      "So, what kind of people does President Trump want to honor? Paolo Zampolli, a longtime friend of the president who has been on the board since 2020, said, \"There were mentioned a list of people, I remember the name of Pavarotti. I remember the name of Andrea Bocelli. They wanted to do something about Elvis Presley.\"",
      "Zampolli has suggested changes to make the Kennedy Center \"better\": \"We're on the Potomac River. We could have a little marina where in the weekend boats can come, and nice cafes, nice location where they can spend the weekend there and make it like a destination. Other things that I suggested is branch franchises around the world.\"",
      "Another idea? Sending art to the International Space Station. \"My idea was to have, not Michelangelo, not Picasso, but you know, living contemporary artists to create very small pieces of art,\" Zampolli said, \"One that can be displayed inside the ISS. One can be thrown in LEO, low orbit, that can circulate in the orbit. And one can be auctioned on the ground of the Kennedy Center, because they need to raise money.\"",
      "Some artists (including those who are LGBTQ) have expressed the belief that they won't be welcome at the Kennedy Center. But Zampolli said, \"I don't think the president have anything against these kind of people. I don't understand what is things 'inclusion' or this 'woke.' The Kennedy Center is accessible for everybody, and has to represent the agenda of America.\"",
      "Not everyone agrees. One thing you won't see at the Center is the musical \"Hamilton.\" Producers cancelled shows after President Trump became chairman. The president's response? \"I never liked 'Hamilton' very much. I never liked it.\"",

      "Asked whether there was any political involvement then, Folds replied, \"Never saw anything like this. This is new, and it was quite sudden. Let's say I get in an artist that has different views than the president. Do they feel safe being themselves? Do they feel safe saying what they believe? They're not political shows, but you can express what you'd like to.\"",
      "And is that no longer the case? \"Well, I suspect it's no longer the case,\" Folds said. \"There is an instinct, an authoritarian instinct, that is true in all authoritarian times in history: Take control of the culture, take control of the arts early on.\"",

    "published": "Sun, 30 Mar 2025 12:06:41 -0400",
    "summary": "To young Brandi Carlile, a girl coming of age and struggling with her own sexuality, Elton John was a flicker of hope in a confusing world. Today, the two music superstars are friends and collaborators, recording an album together, \"Who Believes in Angels?\"",
    "story": [
      "Sir Elton John has millions of fans all over the world, but few of them as devoted as a young girl who first heard his music more than 30 years ago.",
      "In 1992, Brandi Marie Carlile was a kid living in a single-wide trailer in rural Washington State, and to her, Elton John was everything. Young Brandi collected everything about him she could get her hands on \u2013 records, photos, even an Elton John book she borrowed from a library 33 years ago, and kept(!). \"The date is still on here. Boulevard Park Library, May 10, 1992. It's all time stamped. And they're gonna have to come and get it!\"",
      "Little Brandi is now music superstar Brandi Carlile, but to a young girl coming of age and struggling with her own sexuality, Elton John was a flicker of hope in a confusing world. She loved him, and said so in writing, covering an entire page front to back with \"I love Elton John.\" \"It's insane,\" she said. \"I look at it now. I just can't believe what happened in my life to get me to where I am now. It's such a strange thing. It makes you wonder, it just makes you wonder. I do love Elton John!\"",
      "As a kid, she never dreamed she'd get to actually meet him one day, but sometimes dreams have a funny way of coming true. Now they're not only friends, but collaborators. It started a few years back when Carlile wrote to John out of the blue, and asked him to play piano on her new record.\u00a0 Long story short, he said yes, and they grew to be the best of friends \u2013 appearing together, performing together, even vacationing together with their families.",
      "And now, they're about to release an album they made together, recorded at Sunset Sound in Hollywood. It's Brandi Carlile's eighth studio album, and Elton John's 33rd.",
      "So, why did they decide to do an entire album together? John said, \"She's someone I wanted to work with for so long because I know how great she is. I know how her voice is, and I knew what she's capable of, and I wanted to push her more. And I wanted her to push me more. So, I wanted to make a record that was full of energy and great songs. And it turned out really brilliantly.\"",
      "There were cameras in the studio to capture all the highs, and a few of the lows. \"I didn't even think of them being there,\" John said.",
      "\"Yeah, I never saw one,\" Carlile said.",
      "It got tense at times (John admits, \"I haven't really seen the footage, but a lotta people say it's really, really very moving. And all of my behavior is not so moving!\"), but for Brandi, it was still the greatest show on Earth. \"It really felt like I was watching Mozart or, like, one of the great composers,\" she said. \"Stream of consciousness through their entire body, create music in a way that I've never seen. And I was so close. I had a front-row seat.\"",
      "John called it \"one of the greatest musical experiences of my life.\"",
      "Elton John and Brandi Carlile perform \"Swing For The Fences\":",
      "The fact that John got through the recording process at all is remarkable. For the past year, he's been fighting a severe eye infection that's left him nearly blind. But he says that, all things considered, he's doing all right. \"Medically, I'm fit as I've ever been,\" he said. \"I have checkups every month. But the eyesight thing is a bit of a bind, because I haven't been able to watch anything for about seven months. I haven't been able to read. I haven't been able to watch television or anything.",
      "\"But you know what? I've come to the conclusion that if we can't find a solution to it, and this is what it's like for the rest of my life, then I'm okay,\" he said. \"I can still play the piano. I can still sing, which is a gift. My life's fantastic. It's still the greatest gift that anyone could have.\"",
      "These days, John, who turned 78 this past week, is counting his blessings. But the final track on the album really struck a nerve: \"When This Old World Is Done With Me,\" co-written by longtime collaborator Bernie Taupin.",
      "He got very emotional in the studio while recording it: \"Well, I started singing, and I thought the verse was really beautiful. But then I had no idea what was coming. And when I got to the chorus, I realized what was coming, and I just broke down. And I sobbed, and I sobbed, and I sobbed, because it's about my death, basically. And when you get to my age, and a certain age, you think about mortality, because I wanna spend so much time with my children and David and my friends, that you want every single moment to count. And so, this was a song about I don't want to die. I wanna be with my children. I wanna be with David forever. And so, it really got to me.\"",
      "David is husband David Furnish. The two were married in 2014. They have two sons, Zachary and Elijah.",
      "Dad might be a global superstar, but there's no doubt where his heart is. Asked what he is most proud of, John replied, \"Yeah, my kids. My husband. That's it. All I want on my gravestone is, 'He was a great dad.' Nothing to do with music. 'He was a great dad.' That's all I care about.\"",
      "Their new album will be released this week, and for Carlile, it's still a little hard to believe: \"Yeah, it's so weird. Is it not? It's brilliant. Like, it's a wonderful thing.

    "published": "Fri, 28 Mar 2025 12:26:00 -0400",
    "summary": "President Trump signed an executive order targeting funding for Smithsonian Institution programs that he says contain \"divisive, race-centered ideology.\"",
    "story": [
      "President Trump on Thursday signed an\u00a0executive order\u00a0targeting funding for programs at the\u00a0Smithsonian Institution\u00a0that contain what he characterizes as \"divisive, race-centered ideology\" in his latest broadside against a liberalism that has critiqued Western culture and values.",
      "The president said in the order that there has been a \"concerted and widespread\" effort over the past decade to rewrite American history by replacing \"objective facts\" with a \"distorted narrative driven by ideology rather than truth.\" He said this narrative has cast the \"founding principles\" of the U.S. in a \"negative light.\"",
      "\"The Smithsonian Institution has, in recent years, come under the influence of a divisive, race-centered ideology,\" Mr. Trump said in the order. \"This shift has promoted narratives that portray American and Western values as inherently harmful and oppressive.\" He pointed to a sculpture exhibit at the Smithsonian American Art Museum representing that \"[s]ocieties including the United States have used race to establish and maintain systems of power, privilege, and disenfranchisement.\"",
      "The order tasks Vice President JD Vance, who serves on the Smithsonian Institution's Board of Regents, with overseeing efforts to \"remove improper ideology\" from all areas of the institution, including its museums, education and research centers and the National Zoo.",
      "It marks Mr. Trump's latest salvo against cultural pillars of society, such as universities and art, that he sees as out of step with conservative sensibilities. He recently had himself installed as chairman of the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts with the aim of overhauling programming, including the annual Kennedy Center Honors awards show. The administration also recently forced Columbia University to make a series of policy changes by threatening the Ivy League school with the loss of several hundred million dollars in federal funding.",
      "The executive order also hints at the return of statues and monuments of Confederate figures, many of which were taken down or replaced around the country after the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis in 2020 and the rise of the Black Lives Matter movement, which is detested by Trump and other conservatives.",
      "The president directed the secretary of the interior to determine whether, since Jan. 1, 2020, \"public monuments, memorials, statues, markers, or similar properties within the Department of the Interior's jurisdiction have been removed or changed to perpetuate a false reconstruction of American history, inappropriately minimize the value of certain historical events or figures, or include any other improper partisan ideology.\"",
      "The order also calls for improvements to Independence Hall in Philadelphia by July 4, 2026, in time for the 250th anniversary of the signing of the Declaration of Independence.",
      "Mr. Trump singled out the National Museum of African American History and Culture, which opened in 2016 near the White House, the Women's History Museum, which is in development, and the American Art Museum for criticism.",
      "\"Museums in our Nation's capital should be places where individuals go to learn \u2014 not to be subjected to ideological indoctrination or divisive narratives that distort our shared history,\" he said in the order.",
      "Linda St. Thomas, the Smithsonian Institution's chief spokesperson, said in an email late Thursday, \"We have no comment for now.\"",
      "Under the order, Vance is to work with the White House budget office to make sure future funding for the Smithsonian Institution isn't spent on programs that \"degrade shared American values, divide Americans based on race, or promote programs or ideologies inconsistent with federal law and policy.\" The president also wants to ensure that the women's history museum celebrates women and not \"recognize men as women in any respect.\"",
      "The Smithsonian Institution is the world's largest museum, education and research complex. It consists of 21 museums and the National Zoo. Eleven museums are located along the National Mall in Washington.",
      "The institution was established by Congress with money from James Smithson, a British scientist who left his estate to the United States to found \"at Washington, under the name of the Smithsonian Institution, an establishment for the increase and diffusion of knowledge.\"",

      "The Sex Pistols, the legendary English punk band that helped the underground subculture of the genre to reach mainstream heights, is going on its first North American tour in more than 20 years.",
      "The Pistols last went on a North American tour in 2003, when they were joined by original vocalist\u00a0John Lyndon (formerly Rotten).",
      "The 2025 iteration of the Pistols \u2014 original guitarist Steve Jones, drummer Paul Cook and bassist Glen Matlock joined by frontman Frank Carter (of Gallows, Pure Love and Frank Carter and the Rattlesnakes) \u2014 will hit the road on Sept. 16 at a very memorable stage: The Longhorn Ballroom in Dallas, Texas. It was the site of a particularly hostile show for the band when it first toured the U.S. in 1978.",
      "Jones told The Associated Press he recalls having \"pigs' hooves and bottles and whatnot slung at us by cowboys.\"",
      "It is one of a few dates featured in three \"Live in the U.S.A.\" albums, documenting the band's '78 run: Atlanta, Dallas and San Francisco. The latter will be released on April 25 and captures the show where the band originally called it quits.",
      "\"We were thinking of breaking up in San Francisco again,\" Jones joked.",
      "The 2025 tour is currently scheduled to conclude Oct. 16 at the Hollywood Palladium in Los Angeles. The band will hit Washington; Philadelphia; Brooklyn, New York; Montreal; Toronto; Cleveland; Detroit; Minneapolis; Denver; Seattle and San Francisco. Additional tour dates will be announced later.",
      "Pre-sale opens April 2 and 3.\u00a0Tickets go on sale\u00a0April 4 at 10 a.m. local time.",
      "They will perform the band's sole album, 1977's \"Never Mind the Bollocks, Here's the Sex Pistols Album\" live in its entirety as well as other material.",
      "So, why tour the U.S. and Canada now?",
      "\"Why not?\" Jones said.",
      "\"I think everybody needs this band right now. I think the world needs this band right now,\" Carter said. \"And I think definitely America is screaming out for a band like the Sex Pistols.\"",
      "\"At the end of the day, we're living in a really, really difficult time. So not only do people want to come and just be entertained, they want to enjoy themselves,\" he continued. \"Punk is an energetic music. It's one where you can go and vent and let your hair down, hopefully in a safe manner. Fingers crossed, no bottles or pigs' hooves.\"",
      "Carter fronted the Sex Pistols last year for a few U.K. dates. The band said they did not reach out to Lydon to see if he wanted to participate in this reunion tour.",
      "\"The last thing he wants to do is have anything to do with us right now,\" Jones said, referring to a previous lawsuit between the singer and the band over music use in\u00a0their TV series \"Pistol.\"\u00a0The judge ruled against Lydon's opposition.",
      "\"We wish him the best,\" Jones said.",
      "\"Good luck to him,\" Matlock added. \"I wish he thinks, maybe, 'good luck' to us. Probably doesn't. But over the years, John (has had) all our phone numbers, and I can't see many missed calls from him.\"",
      "As for the 2025 tour: Fans shouldn't expect the violence of their 1978 run, but they should anticipate a tighter performance.",
      "\"We're a bit older but we play just as well, if not better,\" Matlock said. \"And I think that's something that's got a great deal of aplomb that we're going to bring to the public over there.\"",
      "Does this mean there could be new Sex Pistols music in the future? \"It's early days,\" Jones said. \"Let's see what happens.\"",

      "\"Colorado is thrilled to welcome the Sundance Film Festival to its new home in Boulder starting in 2027,\" Colorado Gov. Jared Polis said in a statement. \"Here in our state we celebrate the arts and film industry as a key economic driver, job creator, and important contributor to our thriving culture. Now, with the addition of the iconic Sundance Film Festival, we can expect even more jobs, a huge benefit for our small businesses including stores and restaurants.\"",
      "\"This decision was informed by a detailed evaluation of the key components essential to creating our Festival. During the process, it became clear that Boulder is the ideal location in which to build our Festival's future, marking a key strategic step in its natural evolution,\" Sundance Institute Board Chair  Ebs Burnough said.",
      "The Sundance Film Festival takes place every January. The Boulder Film Festival will likely be pushed back by about a month, officials behind that festival previously told CBS News Colorado.",
      "Utah was home to the international film festival for 42 years, but festival organizers said the festival has outgrown its home.",
      "Since entering the selection process, state and local leaders in Colorado have mounted considerable efforts to get the festival moved to Boulder, citing the city's concentration of artists, its history of culture, and the revenue benefits to the city and state.",
      "\"I founded the Sundance Institute with a commitment to discovering and developing independent artists, with the Sundance Film Festival serving as the platform for stories to help expand audiences and broaden the landscape,\" Robert Redford, Sundance Institute president and founder, said in a statement. \"This move will ensure that the Festival continues its work of risk taking, supporting innovative storytellers, fostering independence, and entertaining and enlightening audiences. I am grateful to the Boulder community for its support, and I look forward to seeing what the future holds for the Festival there.\"",
      "As part of Boulder's efforts to attract Sundance, the state legislature is considering up to $34 million in refundable tax credits, which would kick in by 2027, when Sundance is set to relocate here. Some state lawmakers oppose that move, however, with one saying it was unfair to ask the entire state to subsidize what would largely only benefit one community.",
      "Nonetheless, the efforts didn't stop there. City leaders in Boulder previously said that local hotels have already committed to capping room price increases during the 11-day event.",
      "\"Our walkable downtown, iconic venues, and beautiful landscape at the base of the Rocky Mountains sets the stage for the Sundance Film Festival to flourish in its next chapter,\" said Charlene Hoffman, CEO of Visit Boulder. \"It's been a remarkable experience getting to share our vibrant community with the Sundance Institute and we eagerly await the Festival's debut in beautiful Boulder, Colorado with excitement and gratitude.\"",
      "A study by the State of Utah found Sundance had nearly 73,000 attendees in 2024, generating $132 million in economic output, $14 million in tax revenue, and $70 million in wages.",
      "\"Boulder is an art town, tech town, mountain town, and college town. It is a place where the Festival can build and flourish. This is the beginning of a bold, new journey as we invite everyone to be part of our community and to be entertained and inspired,\" the Sundance Institute's acting CEO Amanda Kelso said. \"We can't imagine a better fit than Boulder.\"",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/reciprocal-tariffs-trump-countries-2025/",
    "published": "Tue, 01 Apr 2025 20:13:00 -0400",
    "summary": "President Trump is expected on April 2 to announce reciprocal tariffs on a number of other countries. Here's what to know about these import taxes.",
    "story": [
      "A core element of the protectionist trade policies President Trump is scheduled to announce on Wednesday \u2014 a planned import tax blitz he has referred to as \"Liberation Day\" \u2014 are so-called reciprocal tariffs. Mr. Trump has touted such levies as a way to level the playing field with other countries that impose higher tariffs on U.S. imports, as well as to boost domestic manufacturers.",
      "But some economists say that tit-for-tat tariffs with key trading partners could be hard to structure, while also roiling global commerce and driving up costs\u00a0for U.S. consumers and businesses. Here's what to know about reciprocal tariffs.",
      "What are reciprocal tariffs?",
      "Truly reciprocal tariffs would impose the same tax on U.S. imports that other countries charge on American exports on a product by product basis. For example, if a country imposed a 6% levy on American-made shoes, Mr. Trump would tax that nation's footwear at the same rate.",
      "Currently, the U.S. and its trading partners charge each other different levies on the same products. Germany, for instance, puts higher tariffs on vehicles made in the U.S. than what Washington, D.C., charges on German vehicle imports.",
      "\"Reciprocal means that if a country has higher tariffs than we do on certain products, we would raise it to that level,\" Alex Jacquez, chief of policy and advocacy at Groundwork Collaborative, a left-leaning public policy think tank, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "That would be administratively complex given the tens of thousands of codes that determine the tariff rates on a variety of products.",
      "\"Setting up reciprocal tariffs across every product category with every trade partner would be completely infeasible with our administrative capacity,\" Jacquez said.",
      "Are reciprocal tariffs the same as country-based tariffs?",
      "Rather than impose perfectly reciprocal tariffs, the White House could instead announce country-specific tariff rates calibrated to the their trade imbalance with the U.S.",
      "\"They will probably come up with a blended rate that is not reciprocal by product, but is reciprocal by saying their tariffs are 10% higher than ours on average, so we'll be imposing 10% tariff across-the-board on all goods,\" said Jacquez, who formerly worked as an economic policy analyst in the Biden administration.",
      "That approach could result in the U.S. taxing other nations' products at vastly different rate than they do ours.",
      "\"It will hit a lot of products very differently in a proximate way, because it would be balanced by country but not by import or export,\" Jacquez said. \"That is where complications will arise, and you could see a scenario in which countries retaliate against us.\"",
      "Who are the \"Dirty 15\"?",
      "Trump administration officials have singled out a group of nations they dubbed the \"Dirty 15,\"\u00a0 a reference to the 15% of countries expected to be hit hardest by the new reciprocal tariffs given their trade surplus with the U.S.",
      "Those nations account for \"a huge amount of our trading volume,\" U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told Fox News' Maria Bartiromo on March 18, without naming the trade partners.",
      "National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett also told Fox News that the White House is targeting 10 to 15 nations with the biggest trade surplus with the U.S. Like Bessent, he also refrained from naming those nations.",
      "In 2024, the largest U.S. trade deficits around the globe \u2014 meaning countries from which the U.S. imports more than it exports \u2014 was with the following nations, according to federal data:",

      "France ($16.4 billion)",
      "Austria ($13.1 billion)",
      "Sweden ($9.8 billion)",
      "Are reciprocal prices likely to drive up consumer prices?",
      "Experts say reciprocal tariffs would mean added costs for U.S. businesses, which in turn would likely raise consumer prices in order to protect their profit margins.",
      "\"Tariffs are a tax on a business bringing a product into the country. When they receive it at a port of entry, whether it be an airport or seaport, they have to pay the duty to have it admitted into the country,\" Chris Barrett, a professor at Cornell SC Johnson School of Business, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"You've just added a cost on for the business, and those costs get passed on, at least to some degree, to consumers.\"",
      "How much prices could rise remains unclear. Meanwhile, prices could fall if Mr. Trump later lowers or removes reciprocal tariffs following trade negotiations.",
      "But when there is no good substitute for a particular good, consumer costs are likely to rise more sharply.",
      "\"The more price insensitive they are, the more likely they are to shoulder the burden of the tax,\" Barrett said.",

      "Car prices are all but guaranteed to rise when tariffs go into effect. By contrast, vehicles currently sitting on dealers' lots are insulated from the levies.",
      "\"If consumers are seeing prices on lots saying, 'here's the tariff adjustment cost,' they should challenge that, because sitting inventory is not subject to tariffs,\" Aaron Bragman, Detroit bureau chief of Cars.com, a car buying marketplace, told CBS MoneyWatch. He noted that existing inventory is relatively stable. \"There are vehicles to be had, we aren't seeing an inventory crunch right now.\"",
      "Indeed, McCabe said dealers are seeing increased interest in vehicles on lots from consumers, and \"are going to be more picky on their consumers to get the best price they can.\"",
      "Said McCabe, \"They know the supply and demand issue will change pretty quickly with the tariff impact.\"",
      "That's why his advice to consumers who need a new car is to start shopping now. \"If you need car and can afford it, get out there now,\" he said.",
      "In particular, motorists on the lower end of the income scale should consider making their car purchases immediately, he said, because any kind of price hike could push them out of the market for a vehicle altogether.",
      "\"There's a cost-conscious consumer that if you start tariffing them, they'll stop buying the vehicle because it doesn't fit in their budget,\" McCabe said.",

    "published": "Tue, 01 Apr 2025 13:40:17 -0400",
    "summary": "Here's what to know about tariffs ahead of President Trump's plans to announce new import duties on April 2.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration is planning to impose a round of fresh tariffs on April 2, a day President Trump has dubbed \"Liberation Day.\" The announcement is viewed by economists as the culmination of his \"America First Trade Policy,\" an\u00a0executive order he signed on his first day in office aimed at revitalizing U.S. manufacturing.",
      "Mr. Trump has referred to his April 2 tariff announcement as \"the big one,\" suggesting that the plans may be more far reaching than the import levies he's already unleashed on goods from other nations, such as his March 26 declaration of 25% tariffs on vehicles and auto parts imported into the\u00a0U.S.",
      "\"For DECADES we have been ripped off and abused by every nation in the World, both friend and foe. Now it is finally time for the Good Ol' USA to get some of that MONEY, and RESPECT, BACK. GOD BLESS AMERICA!!!\" Trump said about his April 2 plans in a post\u00a0earlier this month on Truth Social.",
      "On April 2, Mr. Trump will announce his administration's plans for so-called reciprocal tariffs, at an event in the White House Rose Garden, the White House said. He deems the levies necessary to erase trade imbalances with nations that export more goods to the U.S. than they import from America. But the addition of broad-based tariffs to a host of imports is likely to heat up a global trade war that could, at least in the short term, boost prices for U.S. consumers and juice inflation.",
      "\"Tariffs are a tax on imported goods, and research shows that that majority gets passed along to consumers,\" Colin Grabow, associate director of the Herbert A. Stiefel Center for trade policy studies at the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Ultimately, the Trump administration's goal is to increase prices on imports to the point where it's economically favorable for companies to relocate their manufacturing to the U.S., he noted.",
      "\"If prices don't go up, it doesn't deter imports, and therefore there is no reason to set up shop in the U.S.,\" Grabow explained. \"Part of the logic is premised on prices going up, otherwise they are not going to accomplish their goal.\"",
      "Economists say that Mr. Trump's tariff agenda, including the uncertainty surrounding it, could drag down U.S. GDP by depressing financial markets and consumer sentiment.",
      "\"The main channel from trade policy uncertainty to GDP is via business investment. Under higher trade policy uncertainty, future revenue streams of an investment become more uncertain, raising the option value of delaying investment decisions until the situation is clearer,\" Oxford Economics analysts said in a research note.",
      "What tariffs will Trump announce April 2?",
      "Mr. Trump teased his April 2 announcement last week when he announced his new 25% tariffs on foreign-made cars and auto parts. \"That's Liberation Day, that's gonna be on the 2nd, and that's gonna be reciprocal, and I think people will be impressed,\" the president said.",
      "Reciprocal tariffs are designed to match the import duties placed on U.S. goods and services by other nations, as well as compensate for other trade barriers, according to the Yale Budget Lab, a non-partisan public policy think tank. According to a White House memo from Feb. 13, the U.S. faces additional trade barriers aside from tariffs such as regulatory requirements that can make it more difficult for American exports to reach other nations.",
      "While the size and scope of the reciprocal tariffs that Mr. Trump plans to announce are still unknown, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent previously said the administration's reciprocal tariffs would target countries with the biggest trade surpluses, as well as those which have imposed the highest tariffs plus non-tariff trade barriers on U.S. goods.",
      "Multiple nations run large annual trade surpluses with the U.S., including Germany, Ireland and Italy in the European Union, as well as Vietnam, Japan and Taiwan. The U.S. also has a large trade deficit with China, although Mr. Trump has already imposed new tariffs on that nation.",
      "\"It'll be in many cases less than the tariff that they've been charging us for decades ... I think we're trying to keep it somewhat conservative,\" Mr. Trump said on March 26.",
      "Mr. Trump added that he'll introduce a reciprocal tariff policy on \"all countries,\" which he said would be \"very lenient.\"",
      "On Sunday, National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett told Fox News' Maria Bartiromo that there are 15 countries \"that we have massive, massive trade deficits with,\" but that Mr. Trump will ultimately decided how many countries will be subject to new tariffs Wednesday.",
      "Mr. Hassett also promoted tariffs as an effective tool for reshoring manufacturing to the U.S., saying \"it's going to be a boom,\" referring to auto manufacturing in particular.",
      "Meanwhile, additional tariffs are also slated to go into effect on April 2, with Mr. Trump's one-month delay on 25% tariffs on Canadian and Mexican imports set to expire that day. The 25% auto tariff announced by the president on March 26 is also scheduled to take effect on April 2.",
      "What are reciprocal tariffs?",
      "Reciprocal tariffs enacted by the U.S. would match foreign nations' levies and other trade policies on American goods.",
      "A reciprocal tariff policy would include calculating a country-specific number that the Trump administration deems representative of all trade barriers. But import restrictions other than tariffs, such as regulatory requirements, could be hard to quantify, economists say.",
      "\"There are a lot of intangibles, like testing regulations for different products in countries, or perceived openness to business with American companies,\" Simon Macadam, deputy chief global economist at Capital Economics, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"These are things you can't easily put a number on.\"",
      "Because of this complexity, some experts expect Trump's reciprocal tariffs could be more limited in scope, and might not be truly \"reciprocal\" because they may not exactly match other countries' levies.",
      "\"We shouldn't be surprised if some of the stuff is rolled back, or not as sweeping as maybe originally talked about, because logistically, from a practical perspective, running the calculations and coming up with a number is extremely time consuming,\" Grabow of the Cato Institute said.",
      "Wilbur Ross, who served as the U.S. Secretary of Commerce during the first Trump administration, agreed that a truly reciprocal tariff policy would be \"very complicated to get to work.\"",
      "\"If you were literally going to be reciprocal, you would put the same tariff on a product that comes into the U.S. as that country charges on products from the U.S.,\" he said. \"But the problem is you'd be charging a different tariff on the same item from different countries.\"",
      "That would create loopholes for exporters to ship products through lower-tariffed countries to the U.S., Ross added. \"It would make it easy for people to game the system,\" he said.",
      "What does Trump want to achieve?",
      "Through his \"Fair and Reciprocal Plan\" on trade, Mr. Trump is aiming to bring about three outcomes: Boost U.S. manufacturing jobs; close the $1.2 trillion U.S. trade deficit; and gain leverage over U.S. trade partners.",
      "But experts say that trade barriers such as tariffs may not be enough to revitalize U.S. manufacturing jobs, which have fallen sharply over the last few decades. Fewer than 13 million people are employed in manufacturing today, down from a peak of 19.6 million in 1979,\u00a0according to federal data.",
      "\"To a large extent, and particularly in low- and medium-tech industries, the economics of production will not be significantly altered by a 10-20% tariff,\" Macadam said. \"When labor costs in hubs like Mexico are one-fifth of what they are in the U.S., in order to induce companies to seriously relocate a lot of production back to the U.S. a 20% tariff isn't going to cut it.\"",
      "There's also the unknown of how long any new tariffs announced by Mr. Trump will remain in place. Such uncertainty could deter American or foreign businesses from investing heavily in re-shoring manufacturing to the U.S.",
      "\"Even if for some companies it gets to the point where it seems to make financial sense to move back to the U.S., there's the question of, 'Are these tariffs actually going to last a long time?'\" Macadam said. \"If you think the tariff is going to be there forever, then yeah, absolutely relocate. But if it's reversed or rates are lowered, then it would have been silly to relocate.\"",
      "What will tariffs mean for consumers?",
      "Consumers typically pay the price for tariffs, as companies have said they plan on passing off much of the costs to their customers.",
      "As a result, a round of fresh tariffs could boost inflation, economists say. According to an analysis by Oxford Economics, if the effective tariff rate on imports into the U.S. rises from their 2024 level of 2.5% to 10% in April, which is what Oxford Economics expects, prices in aggregate would rise by half a percentage point.",
      "\"Inflation was on trend to fall \u2014 now we expect it to rise,\" Michael Pearce, senior U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, told CBS MoneyWatch.",

Even so, those gains couldn't offset steep losses recorded earlier in the month, with the S&P 500 marking its worst quarterly performance since 2022.",
      "Mr. Trump has dubbed April 2\u00a0\"Liberation Day\" because the new reciprocal tariffs, he says, will restore trade balances between the U.S. and other nations.",
      "But investors are cautious about the impact of a round of new tariffs, which are import fees that are largely passed onto U.S. consumers in the form of higher prices. Consumer confidence this month slumped to a 12-year low as more Americans are expressing concerns about tariffs and a pick-up in inflation.",
      "During the first three months of 2025, the S&P 500 lost 4.6%, marking the worst quarter in two-and-a-half years. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite ended the first three months of the year with a 10.4% decline, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average shed 2.2% over the same period.",
      "Monday's neck-twisting turn has become routine for the U.S. stock market recently because of uncertainty about what Mr. Trump will do with tariffs. Investors are anxious over a potentially toxic mix of worsening inflation and a slowing U.S. economy because households are afraid to spend due to a deepening trade war escalated by Mr. Trump.",
      "\"Consumers are getting fed up, sending confidence to recession levels amid growing fears of higher inflation and deteriorating economic prospects,\" wrote Bob Schwartz, senior economist at Oxford Economics, in a March 28 research note.",
      "The details of Mr. Trump's next round of import taxes are still sketchy, although the president is expected to announce plans for so-called reciprocal tariffs, which are designed to match the import duties placed on U.S. goods and services by other nations.",
      "Most economic analyses say average U.S. families would have to absorb the cost of his tariffs in the form of higher prices and lower incomes, a tough proposition for inflation-weary Americans.",
      "On Monday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 418 points, or 1%, to 42,002, while the S&P 500 closed 0.6% higher. The Nasdaq slipped about 0.1%.",
      "Tesla stock slump",
      "Tesla's woes continued as CEO Elon Musk's electric car company slid 1.7% on Monday. Tesla is down about 39% since Trump took office Jan. 20, with losses driven in part by the public perception of Musk's oversight of the new Department of Government Efficiency that's slashing government spending.",
      "Tesla sales in Europe and the U.S. have fallen, partly due to Musk's political shift to the right. Protestors have targeted the automaker's showrooms, vehicle lots and charging stations, with some resorting to vandalism, including burning privately owned vehicles.",
      "Apple shares were down less than 1% after France's antitrust watchdog fined the tech giant $162 million over the rollout of a privacy feature resulted in abuse of competition law.",

    "summary": "These automakers are the most and least exposed to President Trump's sweeping tariffs on automobiles.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration's 25% tariffs on vehicles and auto parts imported into the U.S. could lead to sticker shock for American consumers, including for those buying cars manufactured domestically, analysts say.",
      "Few vehicle manufacturers will be spared by the fresh levies, which are aimed at revitalizing domestic automobile manufacturing. Industry analysts say the tax will surely raise car prices in the U.S. and squeeze some would-be car buyers out of the market.",
      "Some manufacturers could move a share of production to the U.S., but it would come \"at the expense of reduced competition, higher prices, and significantly lower production in the U.S.'s main trading partners,\" Oxford Economics analyst Abby Stamp said in a research note.",
      "The automobile supply chain is highly complex and intertwined with the economies of Mexico and Canada, from which American brands source finished vehicles and parts. Mr. Trump's tariff on passenger cars and light trucks imported into the U.S. will go into effect April 3, according to the executive order, and a 25% tariff on auto parts shipped from foreign countries goes into effect \"no later than May 3.\"",
      "The price of a typical car could rise by between $5,000 to $10,000 \"out of the gates\" due to the new tariffs, according to a March 31 estimate from Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives.",
      "Meanwhile, car insurance premiums are also likely to jump because the tariffs will make it more expensive to repair vehicles, partly due to higher costs for purchasing new auto parts.",
      "Average insurance premiums could rise to $2,759, or a 19% bump from the typical cost in the fourth quarter of 2024, according to a new projection from Insurify. That increase would come after car insurance costs jumped 11% in February from a year earlier, making it one of the fastest-rising components in the Consumer Price Index (CPI), which measures inflation.",
      "While all car manufacturers will be impacted by the new tariffs, according to analysts, some will be hit much harder than others.",
      "Tesla",
      "Tesla CEO Elon Musk, a close ally of Mr. Trump, posted on X Wednesday that the new tariffs would affect the company's American-made electric vehicles.",
      "\"Important to note that Tesla is NOT unscathed here. The tariff impact on Tesla is still significant,\" Musk wrote on X Wednesday. \"To be clear, this will affect the price of parts in Tesla cars that come from other countries. The cost impact is not trivial,\" he wrote in a later post.",
      "That said, Tesla is expected to be among the automakers that are least affected by the tariffs, given that its vehicles are made in the U.S., and most of their parts are sourced domestically, too. The EV brand does, however, rely on China for some batteries, \"so the tariffs will have an impact,\" Art Wheaton, a transportation industry expert and director of labor studies at Cornell's School of Industrial and Labor Relations, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Tesla rival Rivian could also be spared for similar reasons, according to UBS.",
      "\"We believe TSLA and RIVN could fare better as 100% of their production is in the U.S. (though not all components),\" UBS analysts said in a research note.",
      "General Motors",
      "General Motors, one of the so-called Big Three automakers, along with Stellantis and Ford, is widely expected to be the most exposed to the forthcoming auto tariffs. Headquartered in Detroit, the U.S. car company makes just 45% of vehicles it sells to U.S. customers domestically, leaving 55% of its lineup exposed to tariffs, according to Cox Automotive.",
      "GM, which makes Chevrolet, Buick, GMC and Cadillac vehicles, is heavily invested in Mexico and Canada, where it builds heavy-duty vehicles, according to Cornell's Wheaton.",
      "Stellantis",
      "Stellantis, whose brands include Jeep, Chrysler, Dodge and Ram, among others, is similarly susceptible to rising costs from the tariffs, as it makes between 73%-75% of vehicles for sale in the U.S. stateside, according to Cox Automotive.",
      "That means an $80,000 RAM truck from Stellantis could cost $100,000 once it reaches the U.S., under the new policy.",
      "\"The impact is quite large,\" Wheaton said.",
      "Ford",
      "Ford is among the car companies better positioned to weather the tariffs, according to Cox Automotive analyst Erin Keating, as 80% of its vehicles are manufactured in the U.S. and therefore would not be subject to the 25% tariff on passenger cars. However, any imported parts used in Ford's U.S.-manufactured vehicles could be tariffed at 25%.",
      "Ford vehicles made in the U.S. include the F-150 pickup truck lineup. Some of its smaller vehicles, including the Maverick pickup truck and Bronco Sport SUV are made in Mexico and \"will take a hit,\" said Wheaton.",
      "While domestic automakers will face increased costs, it's unclear how much of the tax they'll pass along to consumers. The\u00a0Wall Street Journal,\u00a0reported that Mr. Trump warned the CEOs of the Big Three not to raise car prices because of tariffs, according to people familiar with the matter.",
      "Toyota and Honda",
      "Japanese automakers Toyota and Honda export a large number of vehicles and auto parts from Japan to the U.S., which represents a sizable market for the companies. Both also operate big plants in Canada, Wheaten noted, leaving them particularly vulnerable to added costs from new tariffs.",
      "The same goes for South Korean automakers Hyundai and Kia.",
      "BMW and Volkswagen",
      "German automakers, including BMW and Volkswagen, which makes Audi vehicles, both operate big plants in Mexico.",
      "The May 3 auto-parts tariff will likely apply to engines and transmission systems, and hit the company \"heavily,\" according to Wheaton.",
      "BMW, for instance, makes a lot of engines in Germany, which it then ships to South Carolina, where the automaker manufactures SUVs. The company could be hit \"heavily,\" by the auto-parts tariffs, according to Wheaton.",
      "Mercedes-Benz operates similarly, sending engines and transmissions from Germany to a plant in Alabama, where the company manufactures SUVs. The 25% auto tariffs would also likely apply to fully assembled Mercedes vehicles shipped to the U.S.",
      "\"I don't think any brands will be spared, because none are 100% in the U.S.,\" Wheaton said. \"They all have products from Canada, Mexico or elsewhere. And even Tesla, which is the most American, still has non-U.S. content in their vehicles.\"",
      "Tariffs could spark affordability issues",
      "Even vehicles whose parts aren't subject to tariffs and that are assembled in the U.S. could face price hikes, as automakers attempt to spread new costs out across their lineups. While Cox Automotive expects price hikes of between 15-20% on vehicles that are caught in the tariffs' crosshairs, those that are exempt could still go up by about 5%, Keating noted.",
      "The auto tariffs could ignite new affordability challenges for consumers by moving lower-cost vehicles closer to, or in some cases over the $30,000 threshold.",
      "Take, for example, a Hyundai Venue, a subcompact crossover SUV, with an average current list price of $24,000. Under Mr. Trump's auto tariffs, that price could rise to about $28,500, adding more than $4,000 to an affordable design.",
      "\"Sub- $30,000 compact SUVs and crossovers that are the most popular are almost all foreign-made, with the exception of one or two,\" Keating said. \"So they'd all be subjected to the 25% tariffs.\"",
      "At the other end of the economic spectrum, luxury Italian car maker Ferrari on Thursday said it would hike prices on certain car models by 10% after April 1, citing Mr. Trump's auto tariffs. The vehicles subject to price increase include the Ferrari 296, SF90 and Roma, which already retail for hundreds of thousands of dollars each.",

      "Yet that's balanced out for Mr. Trump today by continued majority approval on immigration and on his deportation program, specifically. That comes especially \u2014 but not exclusively \u2014 from his Republican base, many of whom say that's just as important as the economy in their evaluations.",
      "Meanwhile, the public continues to weigh the changes brought by the federal workforce reductions, with many believing they will impact programs they care about.",
      "But the matter involving administration officials' use of the Signal app, while seen as serious, does not seem tied to evaluations of Mr. Trump overall.",
      "From a list of items, most say the administration is focused too much on tariffs, and by contrast, is not focused enough on lowering prices.",
      "Donald Trump won the 2024 election in large part on the economy and the idea that he'd make Americans financially better off.",
      "Just before he took office, a sizable four in 10 felt his policies as president would do just that.",
      "Asked about what's happening today, just a quarter of Americans say those policies are making them financially better off. Nearly twice as many say he's making their finances worse.",
      "Even among Republicans, things have tempered. Just before he took office, three-fourths of Republicans said Mr. Trump's policies as president would make them better off, and now, under half of them say that's what is happening so far.",
      "Tariffs, or the threat of them, don't seem to be helping.",
      "Most oppose new tariffs, as they have for a while, and big numbers think that'll lead to higher prices in the short term.",
      "The administration has argued that tariffs will have long-term benefits, but people are more inclined to think they'll raise prices rather than lower them in the long term, too. Tariffs on imported cars in particular aren't popular, either.",
      "(Prices, of course, have been a key concern for years. They are the number one reason that people still rate the economy badly,\u00a0according to recent polling.)",
      "Importantly, though, Mr. Trump doesn't fully \"own\" the issue. Joe Biden still gets a little more blame for today's inflation rate than Mr. Trump does.",
      "Mr. Trump's approval for handling inflation specifically remains negative, and his rating on handling the economy in general has edged into negative territory since last month.",
      "That balances against net-positive ratings for immigration (which are extremely positive with Republicans), and he's even overall.",
      "His overall approval rating has ticked down just a point from last month and is a few points lower than at the start of his term, though it remains above what he got at any point during his first term.",
      "Trump's deportation program, specifically, retains majority approval. That hasn't really changed in recent weeks.",
      "As for some potential implications, as a general principle it's not acceptable to most if some legal U.S. residents were to be mistakenly detained by immigration authorities. But half of Republicans say it would be acceptable.",
      "Judges and the courts",
      "Americans overwhelmingly support the principle of judicial review of the legality of Mr. Trump's policies, including most Republicans. But there's also been calls from some to try to impeach federal judges who rule against Mr. Trump's policies, and that also finds favor with a majority of Republicans, especially those who identify as part of the MAGA movement.",
      "Federal workforce and DOGE",
      "Views on Mr. Trump's efforts to reduce the federal workforce are evenly split in the country.",
      "One reason is that most think the reductions will impact programs and services they care about. A slight majority still think Musk and DOGE have too much influence \u2014 with Republicans, again, standing differently than other Americans.",
      "On the matter of Trump administration officials discussing U.S. military plans on the Signal messaging app, most Americans, including most Republicans, say the matter is serious. And most don't think it was appropriate to use the app to discuss military plans.",
      "Democrats are more likely than Republicans to be following this story.",
      "So far, this situation isn't adversely affecting Republicans in their overall evaluation of Mr. Trump. An overwhelming majority of Republicans who describe what happened as very or somewhat serious still approve of him. Four in 10 Republicans do say what happened was appropriate.",
      "And most Americans would not approve of Donald Trump having the U.S. take control of Greenland.",
      "The Role of Congress",
      "Democrats increasingly call for their party in Congress to oppose Trump \u2014 these figures have risen with each poll.",
      "And those Democrats who are calling for this overwhelmingly say their party in Congress could be doing more to oppose him.",
      "Relatively few Americans, including those in his own party, would generally want to see Mr. Trump have more power as president than he already does; they feel he has the right amount now. And they do see a role for the party in Congress. Majorities of Republicans would have their members push back on Mr. Trump if they disagree.",
      "This CBS News/YouGov survey was conducted with a nationally representative sample of 2,609 U.S. adults interviewed between March 27-28, 2025. The sample was weighted to be representative of adults nationwide according to gender, age, race, and education, based on the U.S. Census American Community Survey and Current Population Survey, as well as 2024 presidential vote.

    "story": [
      "Crowds protesting billionaire Elon Musk's purge of the U.S. government under President Trump began amassing outside Tesla dealerships throughout the U.S. and in some cities in Europe on Saturday in the latest attempt to dent the fortune of the world's richest man.",
      "The protesters are trying to escalate a movement targeting Tesla dealerships and vehicles in opposition to Musk's role as the head of the newly created Department of of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, where he's gained access to sensitive data and shuttered entire agencies as he attempts to slash government spending. Most of Musk's estimated $340 billion fortune consists of the stock he holds in the electric vehicle company that he continues to run while also working alongside Mr. Trump.",
      "Earlier protests have been somewhat sporadic. Saturday marked the first attempt to surround all 277 of the automaker's showrooms and service centers in the U.S. in hopes of deepening\u00a0a recent decline in the company's sales.",
      "By early afternoon, crowds ranging from a few dozen to hundreds of protesters had flocked to Tesla locations in New Jersey, Massachusetts, Connecticut, New York, Maryland, Minnesota and the automaker's home state of Texas. Pictures posted on social media accounts showed protesters brandishing signs such as\u00a0\"Honk if you hate Elon\"\u00a0and\u00a0\"Fight the billionaire broligarchy.\"",
      "The Tesla Takedown movement also hoped to rally protestors at more than 230 Tesla locations in other parts of the world. Although the turnouts in Europe weren't as large as the crowds in the U.S., the anti-Musk sentiment was similar.",
      "About two dozen protesters held signs lambasting Musk outside a Tesla dealership in London as passing cars and trucks tooted horns in support.",
      "One of the signs displayed at the London protest showed a photo of Musk next to an image of Adolf Hitler making the Nazi salute \u2014 a\u00a0gesture that Musk has been accused of reprising shortly after Mr. Trump's Jan. 20 inauguration. A person in a tyrannosaurus rex costume held another sign with a picture of Musk's straight-arm gesture that said, \"You thought the Nazis were extinct. Don't buy a Swasticar.\"",
      "\"We just want to get loud, make noise, make people aware of the problems that we're facing,\" said Cam Whitten, an American who showed up at the London protest.",
      "Tesla Takedown was organized by a group of supporters that included disillusioned owners of the automaker's vehicles, celebrities such as actor John Cusack, and at least one Democratic Party lawmaker, Rep. Jasmine Crockett from Dallas.",
      "\"I'm going to keep screaming in the halls of Congress. I just need you all to make sure you all keep screaming in the streets,\" Crockett said during a\u00a0Tesla Takedown organizing call\u00a0held earlier this month.",
      "In New York City, mayoral hopeful and New York state Rep. Zohran Mamdani joined protesters at a Tesla showroom on Saturday.",
      "\"We are here in a moment that demands all of us,\" Mandani told the crowd through a megaphone. \"It demands all of us because the richest man in the world has purchased the president of the United States.\"",
      "Some people opposed to Musk have gone beyond protests and set the automaker's vehicles on fire and committed\u00a0other acts of vandalism that U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi has decried as \"nothing short of domestic terrorism.\" Musk indicated he was dumbfounded by the attacks during a March 20 company meeting and said the vandals should \"stop acting psycho.\"",
      "Crockett and other Tesla Takedown supporters have been stressing the importance for Saturday's protests to remain peaceful.",
      "But police were investigating a fire that destroyed seven Tesla vehicles in northwestern Germany early Saturday morning. It was wasn't immediately clear if the blaze, which was extinguished by firefighters, was related to the Tesla Takedown protests.",
      "There have been vandalisms at Tesla dealerships acrossing the U.S., including fires in Nevada and Missouri, and graffiti at locations in Massachusetts and Maryland, CBS News previously reported.",
      "Since January 2025, incidents targeting Tesla EVs have occurred in at least nine states, according to a joint intelligence bulletin issued by the Department of Homeland Security and FBI and obtained by CBS News.\u00a0Although U.S. intelligence suggests lone actors are behind them, Trump administration officials are promising to crack down on what they say are coordinated attacks.",
      "There have also been reports of vandalism to parked Teslas, making individual owners nervous.",
      "\"My wife cautions me, 'Be careful where you are at with it,'\" Bill Fonte told CBS New York. \"If you don't like the product, don't buy it. But they're going above and beyond, creating panic and concern for normal people like me.\"",
      "A growing number of consumers who bought Tesla vehicles before Musk took over DOGE have been looking to sell or trade in their cars while others have slapped on bumper stickers seeking to distance themselves from the billionaire's efforts to prune or shut down government agencies.",
      "But Musk didn't appear concerned about an extended slump in sales of new Tesla cars in his March 20 address to employees. He reassured the workers that the company's Model Y, which is undergoing a refresh, would remain \"the best-selling car on Earth again this year.\" He also predicted Tesla will have sold more than 10 million cars worldwide by next year, up from about 7 million cars now.",
      "\"There are times when there are rocky moments, where there is stormy weather, but what I am here to tell you is that the future is incredibly bright and exciting,\" Musk said.",
      "After Mr. Trump was elected last November, investors initially saw Musk's alliance with the president as a positive development for Tesla and its long-running efforts to launch\u00a0a network of self-driving cars.",
      "That optimism helped lift Tesla's stock by 70% in the period between Mr. Trump's Nov. 5 election and his Jan. 20 inauguration, creating an additional $560 billion in shareholder wealth. But virtually all those gains have evaporated amid investor worries about the Tesla backlash, lagging sales in the U.S., Europe and China, and Musk spending time overseeing DOGE.",
      "\"This continues to be a moment of truth for Musk to navigate this brand tornado crisis moment and get onto the other side of this dark chapter for Tesla,\" Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives said in a research note leading up to Saturday's protests.",

      "During a March 10 hearing, Jackson heard testimony about the chaos that erupted inside the agency after government employees were ordered to stop working last month. The bureau's chief operating officer, Adam Martinez, said the agency was in \"wind-down mode\" after Trump fired its previous director, Rohit Chopra, on Feb. 1.",
      "Trump installed a temporary replacement who ordered the immediate suspension of all agency operations, cancelled $100 million in contracts and fired 70 employees.",

      "Mr. Trump has delayed 25% tariffs on Canadian and Mexican imports until April 2, but economists say the import duties could have detrimental effects on their economies given their deep reliance on the U.S. The drop in airline demand reflects \"a degradation of travel demand between the two countries, especially coming from the Canadian side,\" Scott Keyes, founder of Going.com, a flight deals website, told CBS MoneyWatch.",

      "Slashing routes to the U.S.",

      "\"The recent U.S. stock market correction appears to have been partially triggered by investors realising that Trump may follow through with his tariff threats and that this will hurt the U.S. economy,\" said Oxford Economics lead economist Daniel Harenberg and senior economist Kiki Sondh in a Friday report. \"Similarly, consumer sentiment has weakened due to tariff-induced inflation fears.\"",
      "The economy has so far been holding up relatively well, but if it were to weaken while inflation stays high, it would produce a worst-case scenario called \"stagflation,\" which policymakers in Washington have few good tools to fix.",
      "A report on Friday morning showed that U.S. consumers, including Republicans, Independents and Democrats, getting more pessimistic about their future finances. Two out of three consumers surveyed by the University of Michigan expect unemployment to worsen in the year ahead. That's the the highest reading since 2009, and it raises worries about a job market that's been the linchpin keeping the U.S. economy solid.",
      "At the same time, recent CBS News polling shows that Americans have become more dour in their economic outlooks, with relatively more consumers bracing for a slowdown or\u00a0recession\u00a0over the next year.",
      "Automaker stocks",
      "Shares of automakers tumbled on Friday, continuing a rout that began after Mr. Trump announced his new auto tariffs.\u00a0Hyundai Motor fell 2.6% in Seoul, while Honda Motor fell 2.6%, and Toyota Motor sank 2.8% in Tokyo.",
      "On Wall Street, Ford Motor fell 2.6%, and General Motors sank 1.7%. Even U.S. automakers selling vehicles in the country can feel the pain of such tariffs because their supply chains are spread throughout North America. Trump says he wants more manufacturing to take place within the United States.",
      "The rout also hit shares outside the auto industry, with investors concerned that Mr. Trump's trade war may cause U.S. households and businesses to freeze their spending. Even if the tariffs end up being less painful than feared, all the uncertainty may filter into changed behaviors that hurt the economy.",
      "Leading the market lower on Friday was Lululemon Athletica, which dropped 15%. Even though the seller of athletic apparel reported a stronger profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected, it warned that its revenue growth may slow this upcoming year as consumers grow more cautious.",
      "\"Consumers are spending less due to increased concerns about inflation and the economy,\" said CEO Calvin McDonald.",
      "Lululemon also said tariffs and shifting foreign-currency values may account for about half of its expected drop in a key measure of performance: how much profit it can squeeze out of each $1 of revenue.",
      "Oxford Industries, the company behind the Tommy Bahama and Lilly Pulitzer brands, likewise reported stronger results for the latest quarter than expected but still saw its stock fall 3.1%.

Milton's conviction came after a short seller called Hindenburg Research alleged in 2020 that the EV maker had misrepresented its technology.",

Once valued at around $30 billion, exceeding the market capitalization of Ford Motor Co., the EV maker was a rising Wall Street star before it became embroiled in scandal.",
      "Last month, Nikola said it plans to to continue limited service and support operations for vehicles on the road, including fueling operations through the end of March, subject to court approval. The company said that it would need to raise more funding to support those types of activities after that time.",

      "\"This will continue to spur growth like you haven't seen before,\" Mr. Trump said from the Oval Office Wednesday afternoon. \"We'll effectively be charging a 25% tariff. But if you build your car in the United States, there is no tariff.\"",
      "Mr. Trump said the new auto tariffs will take effect on April 2 and that the U.S. would start collecting the duties the following day. The president added he believes the new import duty could raise between $600 billion and $1 trillion in revenue for the U.S. over the next two years.",
      "\"This number will be used to reduce debt greatly,\" Mr. Trump said. \"Basically I view it as reducing taxes and reducing debt.\"",
      "White House staff secretary Will Scharf, who stood next to Mr. Trump during the announcement, offered a more conservative estimate of how much the new auto tariffs would raise, predicting roughly $100 billion in new revenue.",
      "Mr. Trump also reiterated his goal of making interest paid on auto loans tax deductible, while noting that such a deduction would apply only to cars made in the U.S.",
      "Tax deductions are generally only employed by high-income Americans because most taxpayers take the standard deduction, which means tax-deductible auto loans wouldn't impact low- or middle-income households.",
      "Meanwhile, car prices are \"likely to rise significantly\" for consumers, according to Rella Suskin, equity analyst at Morningstar in a Thursday research note. Suskin added, \"Domestically produced vehicles are expected to gain market share, but very few, even from US-based manufacturers, are made with 100% U.S. content.\"",

      "The latest salvo of tariffs comes after Mr. Trump earlier this month gave a one-month exemption to U.S. automakers from the round of import duties that took effect on March 4.",

      "Shares of the Big Three U.S. automakers \u2014 Ford, General Motors and Stellantis \u2014 all sank after Mr. Trump announced the new tariffs. In Thursday morning trading, Ford's shares slipped 38 cents, or 3.7% to $9.92, while GM tumbled 7.3%. Stellantis shed 2.6%.",
      "Tesla shares, which have slumped this year because of disappointing sales and\u00a0consumer unhappiness\u00a0over CEO Elon Musk's involvement with the Trump administration, rose $7.13, or 2.6%, to $279.19. Tesla manufactures its vehicles within the U.S., although Musk said on social media that the electric vehicle maker will still feel an impact. Some Tesla parts are imported from other countries.",
      "\"Important to note that Tesla is NOT unscathed here. The tariff impact on Tesla is still significant,\" Musk wrote on X.",
      "In a statement Wednesday night, Matt Blunt, president of the American Automotive Policy Council, a U.S. trade group that represents the Big Three, said that \"U.S. Automakers are committed to President Trump's vision of increasing automotive production and jobs in the U.S. and will continue to work with the Administration on durable policies that help Americans.\"",

      "When reached for comment, Stellantis directed CBS News to the AAPC's statement.",
      "Mr. Trump has long said that tariffs on auto imports would be a\u00a0defining policy\u00a0of his presidency, betting that the costs created by the taxes would lead both American and foreign automakers to relocate production to U.S. soil.",
      "Automakers with U.S. plants still depend on Canada, Mexico and other nations for parts and finished vehicles. Because booting up manufacturing facilities would take time, in the medium term domestic auto prices would likely increase and car sales decline, experts say.",
      "Car prices could jump",
      "One analysis of Mr. Trump's tariffs estimated that auto prices could rise as much as\u00a0$12,200 for some models\u00a0due to the new import duties, according to a report from Anderson Economic Group, a Michigan-based economic consultancy.",
      "\"In the long-run, this could boost domestic investment and production. In the short-run, however, it will be inflationary and, assuming that domestic producers respond by substantially increasing their own prices, could make new vehicles something of a luxury item,\" Paul Ashworth, chief North America economist with Capital Economics, said in a report.",
      "Targeting imported cars also could strain ties with key trading U.S. partners including Canada, Japan, Mexico and South Korea, as well as Europe.",
      "\"I deeply regret the U.S. decision to impose tariffs on EU automotive exports,\" Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, said in a social media post. \"Tariffs are taxes \u2014 bad for businesses, worse for consumers in the U.S. and the EU. The EU will continue to seek negotiated solutions, while safeguarding its economic interests.\"",
      "About 50% of cars sold in the U.S. are manufactured within the country. Among imports, about half come from Mexico and Canada, with Japan, South Korea and Germany, also major suppliers.",
      "Other groups expressed support for the new auto tariffs.",
      "\"Auto production is the bedrock of a nation's manufacturing ecosystem,\" Scott Paul, president of the Alliance for American Manufacturing, an industry trade group, said in a statement posted social media. \"We've seen it eroded in the U.S. over the past four decades first by Asian imports then by NAFTA. A 25% tariff on auto imports isn't the only way to spur more auto plants here, but it is in my view necessary.\"",
      "Shawn Fain, president of United Auto Workers, said the tariffs could bolster job growth in the U.S. \"With these tariffs, thousands of good-paying blue-collar auto jobs could be brought back to working-class communities across the United States within a matter of months, simply by adding additional shifts or lines in a number of underutilized auto plants,\" he said.",

    "published": "Thu, 27 Mar 2025 09:53:55 -0400",
    "summary": "Starting today, the Social Security Administration will again take 100% of a beneficiary's check to recoup overpayments. Here's what to know.",
    "story": [
      "Some Social Security recipients could soon find themselves in the crosshairs of a policy that advocates for seniors say could cause financial hardship for many older Americans.",
      "Starting today, the Social Security Administration will begin clawing back overpayments from the retirement program by taking 100% of a beneficiary's monthly check until the money is repaid, up from the prior rate of 10%. The policy will impact new cases of overpayments starting on March 27. The benefits withholding rate for people who were overpaid before that date will remain at 10%.",
      "The agency's 100% recovery rate was announced earlier this month by SSA Acting Commissioner Lee Dudek, who has worked with Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, to cut costs at the agency by firing thousands of workers and closing field offices.",
      "Dudek has\u00a0described the 100% clawback rate as part of the agency's responsibility to recover overpaid funds. But advocates for older Americans say the policy will cause financial distress for many people, especially those who rely on the program for all or most of their income.",
      "\"If an overpayment is being made, that means the Social Security Administration is withholding 100% of their payment for however long it takes to repay the agency \u2014 and they are without money to pay for food\" or other living expenses, Dan Adcock, director of government relations and policy for the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare, an advocacy group, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "The clawback policy could prove especially hard on the 40% of Social Security beneficiaries who rely on the program for 90% of more of their income, he added.",
      "In many cases, Social Security overpayments are the fault of agency, with a\u00a02022 report\u00a0by its inspector general finding that about 73,000 overpayments that year were due to a lack of \"effective controls over benefit-computation accuracy.\"",
      "Under the Biden administration, the Social Security Administration in 2024\u00a0capped the clawback rate at 10%, stepping back from its prior 100% level following reports that the higher rate had pushed some Americans into financial hardship and even\u00a0homelessness.",
      "\"The thing is, this administration has said, 'We're going back to the old way, we're getting 100% of the money back going forward,'\" CBS News business analyst Jill Schlesinger told CBS News.",
      "Can you avoid a Social Security overpayment?",
      "In some cases, overpayments are due to miscalculations on the part of the Social Security Administration, or because the agency doesn't update beneficiaries' records in a timely way. That can make it difficult for seniors to know if they're getting paid too much.",
      "But it's also important for beneficiaries to update the SSA with their latest information, such as increases in their income that can lead to overpayments. The importance of updating the agency about such changes may not be fully appreciated by some beneficiaries because of the complexity of the Social Security system, the agency's inspector general said in a 2024 report.",
      "\"We urge beneficiaries to keep a close eye on their benefits going forward,\" said Shannon Benton, executive director of The Senior Citizens League, an advocacy group for older Americans. \"If they notice any unscheduled changes to their benefits, they should contact Social Security immediately.\"",
      "It's important to keep records of your payments and flag any issues, such as if your check is larger than it previously was, Schlesinger said. \"Unfortunately the onus is on us\" to correct the record, she added.",
      "DOGE cuts, long waits",
      "Because of DOGE's job cuts at the Social Security Administration and the closure of agency field offices, it's recently become more difficult for seniors and other beneficiaries to contact the agency to report changes or ask for help, Adcock said.",
      "Those issues arose in a Tuesday Senate confirmation hearing for President Trump's nominee for Social Security commissioner, Frank Bisignano, who said that only about 46% of phone calls to the agency are answered \"because people get discouraged and hang up\" due to long wait times.",
      "Sen. Steve Daines, a Republican from Montana, told Bisignano that one of his staffers this week called the agency's 800 number to assess the level of customer service, but was disconnected three times, once after being on hold for an hour.",
      "\"We've got a lot of work to do to serve the taxpayers in this country,\" Daines said.",
      "Improvements to Social Security?",
      "In the hearing, Bisignano also said he wants to reduce what the agency calls \"improper payments,\" which include both overpayments and underpayments to beneficiaries. Currently, about 1% of Social Security's annual payments are improper, with Bisignano saying he believes that rate should be \"five decimal points to the right.\"",
      "Yet enhancing the accuracy of benefits will likely take a large investment in Social Security because it would require changes in systems, technology and other resources, Benton said.",
      "\"While improvements are possible, achieving such a low error rate is challenging due to the complexity of Social Security benefits and past challenges with fraud and reporting errors,\" she said. \"Some progress is likely and will probably be incremental, but a significant reduction over the next four years will be extremely challenging.\"",

    "summary": "Democrat-backed Susan Crawford won the closely-watched Wisconsin Supreme Court race, the most expensive judicial election in U.S. history.",
    "story": [
      "Susan Crawford, who was endorsed by the Democratic Party, won the closely-watched Wisconsin Supreme Court race Tuesday night in what was the most expensive judicial election in American history.",
      "What would have normally been a sleepy nonpartisan judicial race turned into an expensive battle between Crawford, a Dane County judge, and Waukesha County Judge Brad Schimel, who was endorsed by the Republican Party. The campaigns and their supporters have spent more than $81 million, attracting endorsements and campaign appearances from Elon Musk, Vermont Democratic Sen. Bernie Sanders and other national political figures.",
      "With 91% of the vote in, Crawford led Schimel by 54% to 45%, a margin of about 184,000 votes.",
      "The race was seen by some as an early swing-state test of voter sentiment related to President Trump's performance in the White House, but also a crucial statewide race that could swing ideological control of Wisconsin's closely divided highest court.",
      "Going into the race, liberals held a 4-3 majority, and the court is expected to consider cases related to abortion rights, congressional redistricting, union power and voting and election rules.",
      "By Monday morning, 644,800 advance ballots had been returned, representing about a 40% increase over the advance total in Wisconsin's 2023 judicial race, and that year also set a turnout record. About a third of advance ballots so far have come from heavily Democratic counties of Milwaukee and Dane, in the Madison area, and that's roughly in line with their share of the advance vote in 2023.",
      "Nineteen percent of advance ballots had come from the WOW counties in the Milwaukee suburbs of Waukesha, Ozaukee, and Washington, which is a couple of points higher than their share in 2023.",
      "Given that the more liberal candidate won the 2023 race by double digits, the early turnout numbers looked good for Crawford. But the bulk of the voting occurred on Election Day.",
      "Musk, the world's wealthiest person and an ally to Mr. Trump, personally campaigned and spent big in an effort to sway voters toward Schimel, who both he and Mr. Trump have endorsed.",
      "That effort nearly collided with the justices currently seated on the state's Supreme Court, when Musk was sued over his promise to hand out $1 million to individual voters at a campaign event over the weekend.",
      "The court unanimously declined on Sunday to hear a last-minute attempt by the state's Democratic attorney general to stop billionaire Musk's checks from going out. At a rally soon after the decision, Musk handed two people oversized posters depicting $1 million checks, declaring that the money was payment in exchange for promises they'd be spokespeople for his political group.",
      "Five of the court's seven justices have endorsed a candidate in the race. The court's liberal justices have endorsed Crawford. One of the court's conservative justices has endorsed Schimel, who wore a \"Make America Great Again\" hat while campaigning Sunday.",
      "Polls in Wisconsin closed Tuesday at 8 p.m., which is also the deadline to get absentee ballots to municipal clerks.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Republicans' slim majority in the House grew a little larger Tuesday after GOP candidates in two Florida congressional districts won in special elections.",
      "Republican state Sen. Randy Fine defeated Democrat Josh Weil for the 6th District seat formerly held by Mike Waltz, who left to become President Trump's national security adviser. Waltz had won the seat by more than 30 points in November, but Fine's margin was less, around 14 points ahead of Weil, with 99% of votes counted Tuesday night.",
      "In the 1st District, Republican Jimmy Patronis, the state's chief financial officer, defeated Democrat Gay Valimont, a gun control activist, for the seat vacated by Matt Gaetz.",
      "The wins bump Republican numbers in the House up to 220 compared to Democrats' 213 seats. There are two remaining vacancies in seats that were held by Democrats who died in March.",
      "Though Republicans were not in danger of losing their majority even if Democrats pulled off upsets in both Florida contests, favorable results for the GOP give the party more breathing room as it attempts to pass Mr. Trump's agenda.",
      "Who was running to replace Mike Waltz in Florida District 6?",
      "The race to replace former Rep. Mike Waltz, who resigned from his seat in Florida's 6th Congressional District to become Mr. Trump's national security adviser, had initially appeared unexpectedly competitive.",
      "Democrat Josh Weil, a public school teacher, significantly outraised Republican Randy Fine, with Weil raising more than $9 million through mid-March compared to Fine, who brought in less than $1 million, according to Federal Election Commission filings.",
      "The race gained more attention last week when Waltz appeared at the center of a Signal group chat leak, when Jeffrey Goldberg, the editor of The Atlantic, revealed that he was added to a group on the encrypted messaging app and observed as top Trump officials discussed sensitive plans to strike targets in Yemen.",
      "The race attracted serious fundraising from Democrats, and was in the spotlight after\u00a0President Trump withdrew Rep. Elise Stefanik's name\u00a0from consideration for U.N. ambassador to avoid risking further depleting his party's already narrow majority.",
      "In withdrawing the appointment of Stefanik, a New York Republican who has been among Mr. Trump's most loyal voices in Congress, the president explained that he didn't want to risk further depleting the already narrow majority.",

      "Who was running to replace Matt Gaetz in Florida District 1?",
      "The other special election, in Florida's 1st Congressional District in the state's Panhandle, fills the vacancy left by former Rep. Matt Gaetz, whose nomination to be attorney general was derailed by a House Ethics Committee report that alleged sexual misconduct and illicit drug use. Gaetz, who denied any wrongdoing, withdrew his name from consideration, although he had already resigned from Congress.",
      "The race in the heavily Republican district, which was seen as less competitive, despite sizeable funding for Democrat Gay Valimont. Republican Jimmy Patronis had raised $2.1 million as of mid-March compared to Valimont's nearly $6.5 million, according to FEC filings.",
      "First elections since Trump's return to office",
      "The contests, along with an election for Wisconsin Supreme Court also being held on Tuesday, mark the first elections since Mr. Trump returned to office, in races that are being viewed as key tests for the GOP.",
      "House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, a New York Democrat, stopped short of predicting that Democrats would flip either seat on Tuesday, but said the attention on the reliably red districts should serve as a warning for Republicans.",
      "\"These are races that should not under ordinary circumstances be on anyone's political radar,\" he said at a news conference last week. \"What I can say, almost guarantee, is that the Democratic candidate in both of these Florida special elections will significantly over-perform, which will represent another sign that the Republicans are on the run and that Democrats are going to take back control of the House of Representatives next year.\"",

    "summary": "Democratic Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey began speaking around 7 p.m. on Monday to protest Trump policies and didn't stop till after 8 p.m. on Tuesday.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014\u00a0Democratic Sen. Cory Booker delivered a record-breaking marathon speech on the Senate floor, which started Monday evening and continued more than 25 hours before wrapping up Tuesday night, in a protest against the Trump administration's policies.",
      "At 25 hours and five minutes, the speech now marks the longest on Senate record, surpassing Sen. Strom Thurmond's 24 hour and 18 minute address in 1957.",
      "While many senators have historically used long speeches to filibuster a bill or nomination, Booker's speech was not a filibuster since it did not occur during debate on a specific measure to block proceedings.",
      "Booker, a 55-year-old who first came to the Senate in 2013 and is now the fourth-ranking Democrat, began speaking around 7 p.m. on Monday and said he would continue speaking \"for as long as I am physically able.\" As the sun rose on Tuesday morning and then throughout the day, he was still speaking from the Senate floor. Booker's office in a news release said he came into the speech with 1,164 pages of prepared material for the occasion.",
      "He passed the record-breaking mark at 7:19 p.m. ET, but kept on going, finally yielding the floor at 8:05 p.m.",
      "The Senate chamber erupted in applause as Booker broke the record, as Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer rose to mark the moment.",
      "\"Do you know how proud this caucus is of you, do you know how proud America is of you?\" Schumer said.",
      "Booker cited the legacy of leaders, like late congressman and civil rights activist John Lewis, whom he said stood up \"when this country was facing crossroads, was facing crises, they stood up.\"",
      "\"I rise today in an unusual manner,\" Booker said, before invoking Lewis' refrain to \"get in good trouble, necessary trouble, help redeem the soul of America.\"",
      "\"Tonight, I rise with the intention of getting in some good trouble,\" Booker said at the outset, pledging to disrupt the normal business of the Senate. \"I rise tonight because I believe sincerely that our country is in crisis\u2026 These are not normal times in America, and they should not be treated as such.\"",
      "More than 24 hours later, Booker was still speaking.",
      "The New Jersey Democrat spent some of that time reading letters from constituents who say they have been harmed by the Trump administration's policies, and condemning the administration more broadly \u2014 from trade wars to mass firings to deportations and threats to Medicaid.",
      "Booker occasionally yielded to his Democratic colleagues on the floor, including Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York and Senators Lisa Blunt Rochester of Delaware, Andy Kim of New Jersey, Peter Welch of Vermont, Dick Durbin of Illinois and Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, as they echoed his concerns with the administration and encouraged his effort.",
      "Still, Booker was not permitted to leave the Senate floor without risking control and continuation of his speech. He later explained to reporters that he stopped eating on Friday and stopped drinking water a day before delivering the speech to prepare for the extended time without a bathroom break.",
      "After 7 a.m. Tuesday, Booker acknowledged the 12 hours that had passed, saying he was \"wide awake\" and would \"stand here for as many hours as I can.\" At noon, the Senate briefly paused for the chaplain to say a prayer, as is required under Senate rules during a continuous session. Booker continued to hold the floor.",
      "Asked by Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse how he was doing after the 17-hour mark, Booker said, \"I shall not complain.\"",
      "About 23 hours in, he joked, \"I, first amongst us all, really love to speak.\"",
      "As he approached the record, Booker thanked Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut for standing by him during nearly the entirety of the speech, while recalling Murphy's filibuster in 2016.",
      "\"You stood, and I stood with you,\" Booker said. \"And he said to me days ago, 'if you're going to do this, brother, I will your aide-de-camp this time.'\"",
      "Murphy marked the historic moment, noting that the previous record was set when Thurmond was fighting against civil rights and making the case for \"why this nation should continue to segregate Black and White.\"",
      "\"What you have done here today Sen. Booker couldn't be more different than what occurred on this floor in 1957,\" Murphy said. \"Today you are standing in the way not of progress, but of retreat.\"",
      "At the 24-hour mark, Booker brought his message back to Lewis and the \"good trouble\" that he invoked on Monday.",
      "\"This is the moment, generations get them, we're at a crossroads here, folks,\" Booker said, minutes before the record-breaking moment.",
      "Several members of the Congressional Black Caucus and other House members came to the floor at various intervals to observe the Senator's speech in the rear of the chamber, including Reps. Steven Horsford, Maxine Waters, Jonathan Jackson, Bonnie Watson Coleman, Sean Casten, Steve Cohen.",
      "Booker appeared to grow emotional as he surpassed Thurmond's record, saying he was not here because of Thurman's speech, but \"despite his speech.\"",
      "\"I'm here because as powerful as he was, the people were more powerful.\"",
      "What was the longest floor speech in Senate history?",
      "Prior to Booker's new record today, Sen. Strom Thurmond of South Carolina delivered the longest Senate speech on record, with a more than 24-hour filibuster in 1957. Thurmond carried out his filibuster in an effort to block civil rights legislation.",
      "Booker's marathon speech earlier eclipsed lengthy speeches delivered in recent years, including 21-hour filibuster by Sen. Ted Cruz in 2013 on Obamacare, and a 15-hour filibuster by Murphy on gun control.",

    "published": "Tue, 01 Apr 2025 20:14:36 -0400",
    "summary": "Experts estimate far lower figures in tariffs revenue, warning that President Trump's tariffs could drive up prices for American consumers.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump has argued that some of the tariffs he's imposing this week could help the government raise over $1 trillion in the next year or so, helping to reduce the national debt and even potentially offset some income taxes.",
      "But economists are skeptical that these tariffs can bring in as much as Mr. Trump claims, as consumers will likely reduce their spending on foreign goods when prices go up.",
      "Tariffs are often charged as a percentage of the price that importers pay foreign sellers. They aren't paid by foreign nations, but by U.S. companies who often pass the cost to American consumers by raising prices.",
      "\"You're going to see billions of dollars, even trillions of dollars coming into our country very soon in the form of tariffs,\" the president said last week.",
      "While economic analyses indicate Mr. Trump's tariffs could meaningfully increase annual tariff revenue, the president's trillion-dollar estimates are significantly higher than those provided by think tanks and even some of his own officials.",
      "How much Trump's new auto tariffs could generate",
      "In a recent news conference, White House staff secretary Will Sharf estimated that Mr. Trump's 25% tariff on vehicles and auto parts imported into the U.S. could raise \"roughly $100 billion in new revenue.\" At the same news conference, Mr. Trump claimed moments later \"anywhere from $600 billion to $1 trillion will be taken in over the relatively short-term period, meaning a year from now.\"",
      "The White House did not respond to a request to clarify the source of the discrepancy.",
      "The Yale Budget Lab, a nonpartisan think tank, has estimated that the auto tariffs could raise roughly $600 billion to $650 billion over a period of 10 years \u2014 not in a single year, as Mr. Trump suggested.",
      "\"On an annual basis on average that's $60 to 65 billion. We're not even close to trillions,\" said Ernie Tedeschi, director of economics at the Yale Budget Lab.",
      "The Yale Budget Lab also found that motor vehicle prices could rise by 13.5% on average for Americans, or an additional cost of $6,400 for an average new car.",
      "How much Trump's tariffs on Canada, Mexico, and China could generate",
      "The same researchers found Mr. Trump's 25% tariff on goods from Canada and Mexico, which are slated to go into effect this week, along with the additional 20% tax on Chinese imports that the president has already put in place, could generate roughly $150 billion annually, or up to $1.5 trillion over 10 years. They also found the average household could lose $1,600 to $2,000 each year in inflation-adjusted disposable income as a result of higher prices.",
      "Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs previously made higher estimates that Trump's increased tariffs on these countries could generate roughly $300 billion in new income per year.",
      "Either would be a meaningful increase over the $88 billion in customs duties collected at ports of entry in 2024.",
      "However, economists argue there's a ceiling to tariff revenue that remains below $1 trillion per year.",
      "The U.S. imported about $3.3 trillion in foreign goods last year, according to the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis. The Peterson Institute of International Economics estimated that even if Mr. Trump were to apply a 50% tariff to foreign imports from every country \u2014 which exceeds his stated plans \u2014 it would generate at most about $780 billion annually.",
      "\"If you make something 50% more expensive, you don't expect people to buy the same amount,\" said Kimberly Clausing, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute.",
      "Could tariff revenue replace income taxes?",
      "Mr. Trump has repeatedly floated the idea of using his tariff agenda to offset or even replace income taxes.",
      "\"Under the American first economic model, as tariffs on other countries go up, taxes on American workers and businesses will come down,\" Trump said in a speech to the House GOP in January.",
      "Income taxes generate over $2 trillion per year, according to the Department of the Treasury. Even if a president imposed 50% tariffs on all imports, the income generated would represent less than 40% of what income taxes bring in, according to the Peterson Institute.",
      "\"The problem is it can't raise anywhere near the amount of revenue you'd need to scuttle the income tax. And that's the really, I think, ironclad point,\" said Scott Lincicome, a vice president of general economics and trade at the Cato Institute, which is a libertarian think tank.",
      "Historians on U.S. trade note that tariffs have not been viewed as a primary way to raise revenue since income taxes were introduced in 1913.",
      "In 2024, tariff collections on imports represented just 1.7% of the more than $4.9 trillion in total federal revenue. And according to the Congressional Research Service, tariffs have not accounted for much more than 2% of federal revenue in the last 70 years.",

      "The plan would consolidate agencies that oversee billions of dollars for addiction services and community health centers across the country under a new office called the Administration for a Healthy America.",
      "As CBS News reported last week, the layoffs are expected to shrink HHS to 62,000 positions, lopping off nearly a quarter of its staff \u2014 10,000 jobs through layoffs and another 10,000 workers who took early retirement and voluntary separation offers. That's down from around 92,620 employees at the department in September 2024, according to federal\u00a0records. There were 81,917 at the end of the first Trump administration.",
      "Democratic Sen. Patty Murray of Washington predicted the cuts will have ramifications when natural disasters strike or infectious diseases, like the ongoing measles outbreak, spread.",
      "\"They may as well be renaming it the Department of Disease because their plan is putting lives in serious jeopardy,\" Murray said Friday during a call with reporters.",

Around 873 staff \u2014 two-thirds of its workforce \u2014 are expected to be cut from NIOSH, multiple leaders within the agency were told in recent days.",
      "Beyond layoffs at federal health agencies, cuts are beginning to happen at state and local health departments as a result of an HHS move last week to pull back more than $11 billion in COVID-19-related funds. Local and state health officials are still assessing the impact, but some health departments have already identified hundreds of jobs that stand to be eliminated because of lost funding, \"some of them overnight, some of them are already gone,\" said Lori Tremmel Freeman, chief executive of the National Association of County and City Health Officials.",
      "Union representatives for HHS employees received a notice Thursday that between 8,000 to 10,000 employees will be terminated. The department's leadership will target positions in human resources, procurement, finance and information technology. Positions in \"high cost regions\" or that have been deemed \"redundant\" will be the focus of the layoffs.",
      "Kennedy criticized the department he oversees as an inefficient \"sprawling bureaucracy\" in a Thursday video announcing the restructuring, and said the department's $1.7 trillion yearly budget, \"has failed to improve the health of Americans.\"",

    "summary": "Top ICE official calls removal of Kilmar Abrego Garcia on deportation flight that sent him to a supermax prison in El Salvador an \"administrative error.\"",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration admitted in a court filing Monday that an \"administrative error\" and an \"oversight\" resulted in a Salvadoran man's deportation and imprisonment in a supermax prison in El Salvador, despite a legal order prohibiting his removal there.",
      "Acting Immigration and Customs Enforcement field office director Robert Cerna said that Kilmar Abrego Garcia was removed from the U.S. on March 15 as part of a series of deportation flights that sent hundreds of alleged gang members to a notorious prison in El Salvador, even though an immigration judge had granted him a legal protection from deportation.",
      "Those flights are at the center of a court battle between the Justice Department and U.S. District Court Judge James Boasberg, who blocked further deportations of alleged Tren de Aragua gang members under the Trump administration's invocation of the Alien Enemies Act of 1798.",
      "The March 15 deportation flights transported 238 Venezuelas and 23 Salvadorans, all of whom Trump administration officials described as members of the Tren de Aragua and MS-13 gangs. Lawyers and relatives of many of the Venezuelans have strongly denied claims that their clients and loved ones are gang members.",
      "The filings were made as part of a suit filed by attorneys for Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran man and Maryland resident who received a legal status known as \"withholding of removal\" in 2019 after an immigration judge found that Abrego Garcia, who left his native country in 2011 at age 16, could face persecution by gangs if deported to El Salvador. His case was first reported by The Atlantic late Monday.",
      "Although the Trump administration concedes it made a mistake when it deported Abrego Garcia, it is opposing a request for him to be brought back to the U.S. The government has argued Abrego Garcia is a danger to the community, alleging that he's a member of the MS-13 gang.",
      "The Justice Department has also argued that federal courts lack the authority to facilitate Abrego Garcia's return, since he's now being held by the Salvadoran government and no longer in U.S. custody. Even if they did have the power to order his return, the Justice Department said in a filing, there has been \"no showing that El Salvador is even inclined to consider a request to release a detainee at the United States' request.\"",
      "Attorney Simon Sandoval-Mosheberg called the Trump administration's refusal to try to get his client back \"appalling.\"",
      "\"I've had wrongful deportation cases before, including in the last Trump administration and in every single such case, as soon as they realize what they've done, they bent over backwards,\" he told CBS News.",
      "Abrego Garcia was living in Maryland, alongside his wife and their disabled 5-year-old son, both of whom are U.S. citizens, according to the court filings submitted by his lawyers. Before he was arrested by ICE last month, Abrego Garcia was routinely attending check-ins with the agency, the filings said. His lawyers said he has no criminal record in the U.S., a finding the government has not disputed.",
      "In 2019, Abrego Garcia was standing outside of a Home Depot in Hyattsville, Maryland, soliciting work with three other men when he was arrested. His attorney said he was questioned about whether he was a gang member, and when he told police he was not, the police said they didn't believe him and said they were calling ICE.",
      "During immigration proceedings, Abrego Garcia's attorneys said the only evidence the government provided in support of his gang affiliation was that he was wearing a Chicago Bulls hat and hoodie and that a confidential informant said he was an active MS-13 member in a branch of the gang that operates on Long Island, New York, where Abrego Garcia's attorneys say he has never lived.",
      "\"He's not a gang member. The allegations against him are based on whispers and shadows,\" Sandoval-Mosheberg said.",
      "Abrego Garcia's attorneys wrote in their initial complaint\u00a0that their client's name was not included in a Hyattsville City Police Department report about the Home Depot arrest, and said that the detective who authored the gang affiliation part of the report had been suspended.",
      "An immigration judge ruled that the informant's testimony was \"proven and reliable,\" but said that he should not be deported to El Salvador.",
      "In a statement Tuesday, a Department of Homeland Security spokesperson said Abrego Garcia is \"a member of the brutal MS-13 gang and was reportedly involved in human trafficking. Whether he be in El Salvador or a detention facility in the U.S. he should be locked up.\"",
      "Vice President JD Vance responded to media reports about the deportation on Tuesday, posting on X that \"It is telling that the entire American media is going to run a propaganda operation today making you think an innocent 'father of 3' was apprehended by a gulag,\" adding that Abrego Garcia \"is an illegal immigrant with no right to be in our country.\"",

      "\"The most frequent question I would get about it is, OK, what do you do about going to the bathroom? And you can't you can't leave the Senate floor. And and the very simple answer is: Nothing in, nothing out,\" Cruz told CBS News on Tuesday.",

      "Top federal health leaders across the Department of Health and Human Services were effectively ousted Tuesday from their posts, with many reassigned to positions at the Indian Health Service, or IHS, as part of a sweeping restructuring ordered by Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.",
      "Senior leaders at multiple agencies were removed, multiple health officials said, including Dr. Jeanne Marrazzo. Marrazzo replaced Dr. Anthony Fauci as the head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.",
      "At the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, senior officials put on leave and reassigned to the Indian Health Service include Dr. Karen Hacker, head of the agency's chronic disease teams, Kayla Laserson, head of its global health center and Dr. Jonathan Mermin, director of the CDC's STD and HIV/AIDS center.",
      "\"The revolution begins today!\" Kennedy posted Tuesday on X.",
      "In an email to NIH staff sent Tuesday, obtained by CBS News, NIH Director Dr. Jay Bhattacharya said he recognized he was joining the agency \"at a time of tremendous change.\"",

      "\"As we navigate these challenges, I will do my best to lead NIH through these reforms, implement new policies humanely, and endeavor to earn your trust,\" he said.",
      "A top-ranking official at another HHS agency was also reassigned, one official familiar with the move said. All the other options they were given would have involved relocating, the official said they were told.",
      "Another official said that senior leaders in their team had been offered reassignment to remote locations several states away, one official said. At the Food and Drug Administration, one official had been told that refusing the reassignment would result in them losing their severance pay.",
      "\"How insulting to IHS and the center directors. The IHS sites fill critical gaps, they aren't an American Gulag Archipelago,\" one CDC official said.",
      "Other top officials effectively ousted Tuesday include Dr. John Howard, head of the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health, and Dr. Brian King, the top regulator of tobacco products at the Food and Drug Administration, current and former officials said.",
      "In a statement, an official for the department said that the Indian Health Service was not impacted by this week's cuts and that that the agency \"has long faced challenges related to staffing shortages.\"",
      "\"To address staffing needs and support the IHS in fulfilling its mission, HHS has invited certain individuals to consider positions within the IHS. These invitations are voluntary, and individuals have the option to accept or decline,\" the official said.",

      "New leaders at the FDA and NIH also started on the job Tuesday, HHS announced. They were confirmed by the Senate earlier this month.",
      "The CDC ranked as one of the agency's with the largest workforce cuts in the list published by HHS, with 2,400 employees to be laid off.",
      "In Hacker's center at the CDC, multiple teams were gutted by the layoffs, according to a list circulated among agency officials, including the Division of Reproductive Health, Division of Population Health and Office of Smoking and Health. Under Mermin's STD and HIV/AIDS center, tuberculosis elimination and studies branches were cut.",
      "It comes after several top officials have already resigned or been forced out at federal health agencies, including the FDA's top vaccines official Dr. Peter Marks last week and the agency's top food safety and nutrition official earlier this year.",
      "More resignations or cuts are expected in the coming weeks, officials said, as leaders at the agencies wrestle with the chaos caused by the cuts.",
      "Many agency leaders said they had been left in the dark about the cuts, asking staff to let them know whether they had received reduction-in-force notices Tuesday.",

    "summary": "President Trump has signed a string of executive orders in recent weeks targeting some of the nation's most prominent law firms.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump's string of executive orders in recent weeks that target major law firms mark the latest front in his effort to settle long-held scores with political opponents. But the broadside has been met with alarm about the damage the punishments could do to the viability of the firms and, crucially, the threat they pose to the rule of law.",
      "The executive orders signed by Mr. Trump have so far targeted four law firms: Perkins Coie, Paul Weiss, Wilmer Cutler Pickering Hale and Dorr LLP, and Jenner & Block. But the directive targeting Paul Weiss was rescinded after it and Mr. Trump reached an agreement under which the firm agreed to provide $40 million in pro bono legal services for causes that the administration supports, among other assurances.",
      "A fifth firm, Covington & Burling, was the subject of a directive that targeted the security clearance of a lawyer who assisted former special counsel Jack Smith, who oversaw the two prosecutions of Mr. Trump that were dropped, one in July 2024, and the other after he was elected to a second term. And a sixth, Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP, entered into a preemptive deal with the president to provide more than $100 million in free legal work, along with other commitments. The president announced Tuesday an agreement with Willkie Farr & Gallagher LLP, where former second gentleman Doug Emhoff is a partner, in which the firm would offer at least $100 million in pro bono services. The firm also represented former\u00a0Georgia election workers Ruby Freeman and Shaye Moss in their lawsuit against Trump ally Rudy Giuliani.",
      "The executive orders are among the more than 100 that Mr. Trump has issued since returning to the White House for a second term, and they come amid a broader campaign of retribution against his critics that includes revoking security clearances and protective details.",
      "But legal scholars warn that the restrictions aimed at the law firms strike at the rule of law and the nation's adversarial system of justice.",
      "\"These orders do more than just take revenge against particular lawyers who have crossed Donald Trump,\" said Walter Olson, a senior fellow at the Cato Institute. \"They are meant to send the message that it is dangerous to oppose him in court, that you are apt to suffer not just yourself, but also law firms that you're associated with will suffer sweeping penalties that can threaten their very ability to go on existing.\"",
      "The orders rolled out by Mr. Trump in the past few weeks target the firms for their legal work, as well as the lawyers who were on their payrolls \u2014 even if they're not anymore.",
      "In the case of Perkins Coie, the president's directive attacks the firm for representing Hillary Clinton during her 2016 presidential campaign and hiring a research firm that retained former British spy Christopher Steele, who produced the infamous \"Steele Dossier.\"",
      "For WilmerHale and Jenner & Block, the orders seek to punish the firms because they hired lawyers who worked on the Justice Department's investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election during Mr. Trump's first term. At WilmerHale, that includes Robert Mueller, the former special counsel who led that probe, and two lawyers who worked on his team, Aaron Zebley and James Quarles. Mueller and Quarles no longer work at WilmerHale. At Jenner & Block, the president attacked the firm for employing Andrew Weissmann, who also worked on Mueller's probe. He left Jenner & Block in 2021.",
      "Jenner & Block, WilmerHale and Perkins Coie are also involved in legal challenges to Mr. Trump's second-term policies, including his effort to withhold federal funds from medical institutions that provide gender-affirming care to young people under the age of 19, his firing of eight inspectors general and directive to prohibit transgender people from serving in the military.",
      "\"These firms are at the vanguard of fighting the Trump administration on a whole host of issues,\" said David Lat, a lawyer-turned-writer who authors a newsletter on legal affairs. \"So, if Donald Trump can force or frighten law firms into not taking cases against his administration, that will allow the administration to become more powerful.\"",
      "Lat likened the executive orders to a boxing match where one fighter is trying to chop the arms off of their opponent.",
      "\"In America, our legal system rests on the idea that you are entitled to a lawyer, and these executive orders are deterring law firms and lawyers from taking certain cases,\" he said. \"The other issue is they are a threat to the rule of law, and they are a threat to the adversarial system that powers our justice system.\"",
      "Mr. Trump justified the orders as furthering his administration's commitment to addressing the \"significant risks\" associated with \"Big Law firms,\" which he claims \"engage in conduct detrimental to critical American interests.\"",
      "The president's orders specifically require any government contractors to disclose any business they have with the firms and also direct agency heads to cancel any contracts with the targets of the orders. Agencies also must reassess contracts with the firms or companies that do business with them to ensure funding decisions align \"with the interests of the citizens of the United States\" and administration priorities.",
      "Finally, Mr. Trump's executive actions calls on his administration to restrict access to federal buildings for employees of Perkins Coie, WilmerHale and Jenner & Block.",
      "The three firms have all filed federal lawsuits challenging the orders as violations of the First, Fifth and Sixth Amendments.",
      "\"This lawsuit is absolutely critical to vindicating the First Amendment, our adversarial system of justice, and the rule of law,\" Paul Clement, who served as solicitor general under President George W. Bush and has argued more than 100 cases before the Supreme Court, said in a statement. Clement is representing WilmerHale in its challenge to Mr. Trump's executive order.",
      "Three different judges assigned to each of the cases \u2014 appointed by two different presidents \u2014 have agreed to temporarily block portions of the orders while proceedings move forward. While the cases may end with a decision from the Supreme Court months from now that invalidates the directives as unconstitutional, the fallout has been swift.",
      "Thomas Perrelli, firm chair and a partner at Jenner & Block, said in a declaration last week that one client was notified by the Justice Department that they could not bring their lawyers from the firm to a department meeting set for April 3. That client, Perrelli wrote, would've had to attend the meeting without their outside representation or hire new counsel. A federal district court blocked enforcement of the portion of Mr. Trump's order restricting Jenner & Block employees' access to federal buildings and the requirements for government contractors.",
      "He also wrote that 40% of the firm's revenue last year came from clients who are government contractors or subcontractors, and warned that if the firm lost that business, \"it would be a serious threat to the firm's financial health.\"",
      "Bruce Berman, general counsel at WilmerHale, wrote in his own declaration that at least 21 of the firm's 25 largest clients in 2024 \u2014 which accounted for 30% of its revenue, or nearly $500 million \u2014 have federal contracts. He noted that WilmerHale attorneys are set to meet with Justice Department lawyers over videoconference this week, but said at the time of his filing that it was uncertain whether they would refuse to meet with them.",
      "At Perkins Coie, David Burman, a partner at the firm, told a federal court in a filing that several clients terminated or said they were considering ending their legal engagements because of the restrictions imposed by Mr. Trump's order. Burman said that a major government contractor that had been a client for more than 35 years withdrew its work from Perkins Coie in light of the order, and four other clients rescinded its work from the firm early last month because they needed to engage with federal agencies.",
      "\"The orders don't have to go into effect for them to strike fear in the hearts of lawyers across the country,\" Lat said, adding that while law firms are wealthy, they can also be fragile.",
      "For many so-called \"Big Law\" firms, their work involves serving not only individuals, but also large corporations that seek help with patent or trademark applications, mergers and acquisitions or energy transactions \u2014 areas that land before a federal regulatory agency.",
      "But a swift departure of those clients means firms are at risk of losing sizable chunks of business at once, which could also force their lawyers to leave if their practice area involves significant government involvement.",
      "\"These firms can face a run of clients against them the same way the banks can face a run of depositors trying to take out their money at once,\" Olson said. \"This can quickly turn into a downward spiral.\"",
      "The potential damage to their business \u2014 and the ripple effect that would have on employees \u2014 may be why some law firms have remained on the sidelines and chosen not to speak out against Mr. Trump's sanctions. Olson acknowledged there are many reasons why other firms may want to stay out of the president's sight line for fear of retaliation.",
      "But he said that an \"age-old part of being a free republic\" is protecting the independence of the court and the legal profession so they don't become instruments of the person in power.",

      "The measure, which was introduced by Democratic Rep. Brittany Pettersen of Colorado in January, would allow new parents to designate a colleague to vote for them for 12 weeks after they or their spouse gives birth.

      "AFGE Local 3403, the union representing IMLS employees, said the notification to employees came after a \"brief meeting between DOGE staff and IMLS leadership.\" It said museums and libraries would no longer be able to contact IMLS staff for updates about their funding. The message also said the status of previously awarded grants is unclear, but that funding is likely to be terminated.",
      "IMLS has approximately 77 employees and was created by Congress as an independent federal agency in 1996 through the Museum and Library Services Act to support American museums and libraries. Last year, the institute awarded $267 million in grants across the country, with a focus on helping to organize book drives and museum field trips in areas without existing access to libraries or museums.",
      "EveryLibrary, an organization supporting libraries across the country, called the move to put employees on leave \"potentially devastating for institutions that depend on federal support to meet local needs.\"",

The notice said email accounts would be disabled and instructs employees to leave laptops and work cellphones in the office, according to text of the email shared with CBS News.",
      "One employee said Sonderling's arrival at the agency seemed to signal that employees would soon be put on administrative leave. They have not been told what will happen to the agency, though one possibility entails shrinking the staff footprint to 30 employees and moving them to the Labor Department, according to the Federal News Network.",

      "Oscar-winning director Oliver Stone, whose 1991 film \"JFK\" portrayed President John F. Kennedy's assassination as the work of a shadowy government conspiracy, is set to testify to Congress on Tuesday about thousands of newly released government documents surrounding the killing.",
      "Scholars say the files that President Trump ordered to be released showed nothing undercutting the conclusion that a lone gunman killed Kennedy, and the declassified versions did not appear to contain significant new revelations about the assassination, based on a review by CBS News. Many documents were previously released but contained newly removed redactions, including Social Security numbers, angering people whose personal information was disclosed.",
      "The first hearing of the House Task Force on the Declassification of Federal Secrets comes five decades after the Warren Commission investigation concluded that Lee Harvey Oswald, a 24-year-old former Marine, acted alone in fatally shooting Kennedy as his motorcade finished a parade route in downtown Dallas on Nov. 22, 1963.",
      "Republican Rep. Anna Paulina Luna of Florida, who chairs the task force, said last month that she wants to work with writers and researchers to help solve \"one of the biggest cold case files in U.S. history.\" Scholars and historians haven't viewed the assassination as a cold case, viewing the evidence for Oswald as a lone gunman as strong.",
      "Stone's \"JFK\" was nominated for eight Oscars, including best picture, and won two. It grossed more than $200 million but was also dogged by questions about its factuality.",
      "The last formal congressional investigation of Kennedy's assassination ended in 1978, when a House committee issued a report concluding that the Soviet Union, Cuba, organized crime, the CIA and the FBI weren't involved, but Kennedy \"probably was assassinated as a result of a conspiracy.\" In 1976, a Senate committee said it had not uncovered enough evidence \"to justify a conclusion that there was a conspiracy.\"",
      "The Warren Commission, appointed by Kennedy's successor, President Lyndon B. Johnson, concluded that Oswald fired on Kennedy's motorcade from a sniper's perch on the sixth floor of the Texas School Book Depository, where Oswald worked. Police arrested Oswald within 90 minutes, and two days later, Jack Ruby, a nightclub owner, shot Oswald during a jail transfer broadcast on live television.",
      "For Tuesday's hearing, the task force also invited Jefferson Morley and James DiEugenio, who both have written books arguing for conspiracies behind the assassination. Morley is editor of the JFK Facts blog and vice president of the Mary Ferrell Foundation, a repository for files related to the assassination. He has praised Luna as being open to new information surrounding the killing.",

    "story": [
      "A federal judge in California on Monday agreed to delay the Trump administration's move to terminate the Temporary Protected Status (TPS) program that currently shields roughly 350,000 Venezuelan migrants from deportation.",
      "Under a decision announced by Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem in February, these migrants were slated to lose their government-issued work permits and deportation protections next week, on April 7.",
      "But in a scathing decision on Monday, U.S. District Court Judge Edward Chen ruled in favor of TPS holders who filed a lawsuit against Noem's decision and postponed her action until he adjudicates the merits of the case.",
      "Chen called Noem's decision \"unprecedented,\" noting that the U.S. government had never before abruptly terminated a TPS program without a significant wind-down period. He said the move appeared to be \"predicated on negative stereotypes\" about Venezuelans, citing references in Noem's order about alleged gang members from Venezuela entering the U.S. and Venezuelan migrants straining resources in American communities.",
      "\"(T)he Court finds that the Secretary's action threatens to: inflict irreparable harm on hundreds of thousands of persons whose lives, families, and livelihoods will be severely disrupted, cost the United States billions in economic activity, and injure public health and safety in communities throughout the United States,\" Chen wrote in his ruling.",
      "The plaintiffs, Chen continued, are likely going to prevail in arguing that Noem's actions \"are unauthorized by law, arbitrary and capricious, and motivated by unconstitutional animus.\"",
      "CBS News has reached out to representatives for the Department of Homeland Security for comment on Monday's court order.",
      "Advocates for migrants praised the ruling, saying it would curb the Trump administration's plan to carry out the largest deportation campaign in American history.",
      "\"The Court's decision provides a crucial protection against mass deportations for a population that this administration has singled out for extreme vilification,\" said Ahilan Arulanantham, the co-director of the Center for Immigration Law and Policy at UCLA School of Law and one of the lawyers in the case being heard by Chen.",
      "Created by Congress in 1990, TPS allows the U.S. government to grant temporary immigration protections to migrants from nations beset by war, environmental disasters or other crises that make it dangerous to send deportees there. While it does not place beneficiaries on a path to permanent legal residency, TPS allows them to apply for renewable work permits and deportation deferrals.",
      "The Biden administration vastly increased the number of migrants eligible for TPS, creating or expanding programs for Afghanistan, Cameroon, Haiti, Ukraine, Venezuela and other countries. The Venezuela TPS program is the biggest of its kind, covering roughly 600,000 people through two separate designations in 2021 and 2023.",
      "Republicans have long criticized TPS programs, arguing they are often extended improperly and that they reward illegal immigration since some of those eligible for the policy are in the country without proper documents. On the first day of his second term, President Trump ordered officials to review TPS programs to ensure they are \"limited in scope.\"",
      "Less than two weeks after that order, Noem announced she was revoking the 2023 TPS designation for Venezuelans and undoing the Biden administration's last-minute extension of the program. While Noem acknowledged in her decision that some conditions in Venezuela cited by the Biden administration persist, she determined it was \"contrary to the national interest\" to continue the TPS policy.",
      "Venezuelans enrolled in TPS through the 2021 designation are slated to keep their status through at least September.",
      "When it first offered Venezuelans TPS in 2021, the Biden administration cited the political and economic turmoil in Venezuela under the regime of President Nicolas Maduro. Over the past years,\u00a0nearly 8 million people\u00a0have left Venezuela, settling in neighboring South American countries, the U.S. and other nations as part of the largest exodus ever recorded in the Western Hemisphere.",
      "Noem has also announced plans to start phasing out the TPS program for hundreds of thousands of Haitians, as early as this summer. Advocates have asked Chen to intervene and rule against that move, but the judge has yet to rule on that request.",

    "published": "Mon, 31 Mar 2025 19:17:00 -0400",
    "summary": "President Donald Trump again suggested he may try to run for a third term in office, despite limits set by the 12th and 22nd Amendments.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump has periodically floated the idea of serving a third term in office since his first reelection campaign and seemed to double down on it Sunday during an interview with NBC News, suggesting \"there are methods\" to do it despite term limits set by the 12th and 22nd Amendments in the U.S. Constitution.",
      "To date, Franklin D. Roosevelt is the only president in the history of the United States to serve more than two terms, ultimately sitting in office from 1933 to 1945, when he died shortly after beginning his fourth term. His third term was controversial, said Noah Rosenblum, a legal historian and constitutional law professor at New York University, noting that FDR's tenure broke from a precedent set by George Washington and drew accusations of dictatorial ambitions as well as a disrespect for democracy.",
      "\"There are very few norms as deeply embedded in American democratic culture as the idea that the president serves two terms,\" Rosenblum told CBS News. \"And clever word games to try to get around that are really nothing but attempts to undermine the clear text, spirit and intention of the Constitution and this historical process that ungirds it.\"",
      "Here's what to know about the amendments that regulate how long any one person can remain president.",
      "What is Trump saying about seeking a third term?",
      "Mr. Trump has mentioned staying in office after his current, second term ends on numerous occasions, stretching back to his first administration. On the campaign trail in 2020, he told attendees at a rally in Minden, Nevada, that he believed he would win that year's election against Joe Biden and went on to suggest he could take the White House for a third time afterward.",
      "\"We're going to win four more years in the White House. And then after that, we'll negotiate, right?\" Mr. Trump said at the time. \"Because we're probably, based on the way we were treated, we're probably entitled to another four after that.\" It was unclear at the time if Mr. Trump meant what he said, but the comments stoked national discourse about whether he would, or could, truly attempt to flout the two-term limit.",
      "Those questions began to crop up again after the president's recent remarks to NBC News, in which he said during a phone interview from Mar-a-Lago that he was \"not joking\" about trying to serve a third term in the White House.",
      "\"There are methods which you could do it,\" said Mr. Trump, although he added, \"It is far too early to think about it.\"",
      "When asked by NBC's Kristen Welker about a hypothetical scenario where Vice President JD Vance won the next election and handed the authority back to him, he said that could be one way to end up in office for a third time.",
      "\"But there are others, too. There are others,\" Mr. Trump continued, declining to elaborate when asked.",
      "What does the 22nd Amendment say, exactly?",
      "The opening line of the 22nd Amendment to the Constitution states: \"No person shall be elected to the office of the President more than twice, and no person who has held the office of President, or acted as President, for more than two years of a term to which some other person was elected President shall be elected to the office of the President more than once.\"",
      "The latter portion of that section means that if the vice president takes over the presidency if an elected president dies, for example, and serves in that role for more than half of the originally elected president's term, then they could only serve one more presidential term after that. The former restricts an individual to two four-year terms of service as president, applying to consecutive and non-consecutive terms.",
      "Addressing remarks by some, like constitutional law scholar Lawrence Tribe, who has observed that the amendment as written merely prevents a sitting president from being elected, but not serving, more than twice, Rosenblum said the language \"reinforces the intention of the amendment, which is not to prevent someone from being elected president twice, it's to make sure nobody serves more than two terms as president.\"",
      "\"The language of the 22nd Amendment is framed in terms of the language of 'election,' but the purpose of the amendment is clear,\" Rosenblum told CBS News. \"It's to ensure that the office of the president transfers and cycles as part of the democratic process.\"",
      "Why was the 22nd Amendment ratified?",
      "Congress proposed the 22nd Amendment in 1947 in response to critiques of FDR's presidency, which ended with Roosevelt's death in April 1945, a few months into his fourth term.",
      "The National Constitution Center notes that Republicans who had long opposed FDR found allies among some Democrats from the South and West to get the proposal passed through Congress and sent to the states for ratification. The 22nd Amendment was ratified in 1951.",
      "Harry Truman, who was Roosevelt's vice president, stepped in as president in 1945 and was subsequently elected to fulfill another term in office when that one concluded. Truman opted not to run again in 1952.",
      "What about the 12th Amendment?",
      "The 12th Amendment preceded the 22nd by well over a century but even then it included a provision about who is and is not eligible to run for president and vice president. This amendment was introduced by federal legislators in 1803 and ratified about six months later, in 1804, taking effect in time for the year's presidential election that saw Thomas Jefferson assume office.",
      "It primarily focuses on the processes through which the Electoral College votes to elect a U.S. president and vice president,\u00a0the National Constitution Center writes. However, the amendment also states that \"no person constitutionally ineligible to the office of President shall be eligible to that of Vice-President of the United States.\"",
      "That would mean Mr. Trump could not run for vice president on the ticket of another presidential candidate after finishing his second term in office if the 22nd Amendment's provisions prevent him from running for president.",
      "Is there a way Trump could serve a third term?",
      "Rosenblum said Mr. Trump's ability to serve a third term could come down to how the courts interpret the 12th and 22nd Amendments. He pointed out that even those committed to more literal application of the Constitution tend to interpret the language \"with an eye toward what the real purpose is.\"",
      "In this case, he said, that would be upholding the term limits it has laid out. Still, Rosenblum cautioned, \"a president who's interested in remaining in power, despite limits against it, will come up with clever legal arguments to do so.\"",
      "\"This is an administration that has repeatedly shown itself contemptuous of the rule of law,\" said Rosenblum. \"So, will Trump be able to violate the law and remain in office indefinitely? Only if the American people let him.\"",
      "Asked about Mr. Trump's comments and whether the president could get a third term, Senate Majority Leader John Thune said, \"Not without a change in the Constitution.\"",
      "He added, \"I think that you guys [reporters] keep asking the question and \u2026 I think he is having some fun with it, probably messing with you.\"",
      "Other legal scholars who have weighed in on the subject say they doubt Mr. Trump could manage to usurp the amendments and their long-held rules of law.",
      "\"I don't think there's any 'one weird trick' to getting around presidential term limits,\" Derek Muller, a professor of election law at Notre Dame, told the Associated Press.",
      "Muller suggested Mr. Trump has mentioned running for a third term \"to show as much strength as possible,\" adding that \"a lame-duck president like Donald Trump has every incentive in the world to make it seem like he's not a lame duck.\"",
      "All told, the question of Mr. Trump continuing as president past January 2029 is \"incredibly complicated,\" said Michael Dorf, a constitutional law scholar and Cornell University professor whose blog series, \"Wait, Can He Actually Do That?,\" analyzes the latest actions by the administration when one \"seemingly exceeds the president's authority.\"",
      "Dorf has identified two main reasons for the complexity.",
      "\"One, is that our system for electing presidents is complicated, even in normal times,\" he told CBS News. \"But it's also complicated because, ultimately, no legal system can work if people are acting in constant bad faith. There has to be some sort of willingness of people to accept defeat, or to give the law a sensible meaning. And Trump has shown repeatedly that if it disfavors him, he's going to ignore longstanding norms.\"",

      "Trump supporters like former strategist Steve Bannon have called on the president to run again, and Rep. Andy Ogles, a Tennessee Republican, introduced a resolution earlier this year to amend the Constitution to allow Mr. Trump to be elected to another term. Senate Majority Leader John Thune also said of Mr. Trump's prospects of serving a third term, \"not without a change in the Constitution.\" He told reporters, \"I think that you guys keep asking the question and \u2026 I think he is having some fun with it, probably messing with you.\"",
      "Experts say changing the Constitution is extremely unlikely. Election law scholars\u00a0raised the possibility that talk of a third term, whatever its likelihood, may function as a show of strength to try to stave off the perception that Mr. Trump is a lame-duck president.",
      "Here's a timeline of Mr. Trump's comments on a third term:",
      "\"We're probably entitled to another four after that\"",
      "Mr. Trump flirted with additional time in office beyond two terms when he sought reelection in 2020. During a rally in Minden, Nevada, the president predicted he would win four more years in the White House, and even suggested that he could go on to another term after his second.",
      "\"We're going to win four more years in the White House. And then after that, we'll negotiate, right?\" Mr. Trump said. \"Because we're probably, based on the way we were treated, we're probably entitled to another four after that.\"",
      "\"Am I allowed to run again?\"",
      "Shortly after returning to office, Mr. Trump again made reference to another term at a rally in Las Vegas on Jan. 25.",
      "\"It will be the greatest honor of my life to serve, not once but twice \u2014 or three times or four times,\" Mr. Trump quipped to applause from the crowd, before adding that \"no, it will be to serve twice.\"",
      "Then on Jan. 27, Mr. Trump joked to Republican lawmakers about a third term. Speaking before the House GOP conference in Florida, Mr. Trump touted the money he'd raised for another race that he said \"I assume I can't use for myself.\"",
      "\"But I'm not 100% sure because, I don't know,\" the president continued, to laughter from House Republicans. \"I think I'm not allowed to run again. I'm not sure. Am I allowed to run again?\"",
      "\"Should I run again? You tell me.\"",
      "At the National Prayer Breakfast on Feb. 6, Mr. Trump said, \"They say I can't run again \u2014 that's the expression.\"",
      "\"Then somebody said, 'I don't think you can.' Oh,\" the president added.",
      "On Feb. 20, the president again joked about an additional term at a White House event to mark Black History Month, as he celebrated the support he saw from Black Americans in the 2024 election.",
      "\"Should I run again? You tell me,\" Mr. Trump said, as supporters chanted, \"four more years!\"",
      "\"There are methods\"",
      "In an interview with NBC's Kristen Welker on March 30, Mr. Trump said, \"I'm not joking\" about serving a third term, and for the first time mentioned an awareness of potential paths.",
      "\"There are methods which you could do it,\" Mr. Trump said in a phone interview, adding that \"it is far too early to think about it.\"",
      "The president pointed to his favorability rating and suggested that Americans would like him to serve a third term. Mr. Trump told Welker, \"I have had more people say, 'please run again,'\" while noting \"we have a long way to go before we even think about that.\" On Air Force One Sunday night, he\u00a0spoke\u00a0with reporters and briefly addressed questions about a third term and reiterated that it's still a distant consideration.",
      "\"No matter how you look at it, we've got a long time to go. We have a long time. You know, we have almost four years to go,\" Mr. Trump told reporters. \"But despite that, so many people are saying, 'you've got to run again.' They love the job.\"",
      "While speaking to reporters on Monday in the Oval Office, Mr. Trump denied that he has ever looked into running for another term.",
      "\"People are asking me to run,\" he said. \"There's a whole story about running for a third term. I don't know. I never looked into it. They do say there's a way you can do it. But I don't know about that. But I have not looked into it.\"",

I'm not sure that everybody agrees with me, but we can make a deal that would be just as good as if you won militarily,\" Mr. Trump said. \"But the time is happening now. The time is coming up. Something's going to happen one way or the other. I hope that Iran \u2014 and I've written him a letter, saying, 'I hope you're going to negotiate.' Because if we have to go in militarily, it's going to be a terrible thing \u2014 for them.\"",
      "On Sunday, in an interview with NBC News taped before Pezeshkian's comments, Mr. Trump reiterated that he is considering military action and secondary tariffs if Iran does not agree to a nuclear deal.",
      "\"If they don't make a deal, there will be bombing and it will be bombing the likes of which they have never seen before,\" he said.",
      "Mr. Trump's overture comes as both Israel and the U.S. have warned they will never let Iran acquire a nuclear weapon, leading to fears of a military confrontation as Tehran enriches uranium at near weapons-grade levels \u2013 something only done by atomic-armed nations.",
      "Iran has long maintained its program is for peaceful purposes, even as its officials increasingly threaten to pursue the bomb as tensions are high with the U.S. over its sanctions and after the collapse of a ceasefire in Israel's\u00a0war against Hamas in the Gaza Strip.",
      "As the U.S. conducts intense airstrikes targeting the Iranian-backed Houthi rebels of Yemen, the risk of military action targeting Iran's nuclear program remains on the table.",
      "A\u00a0report last month\u00a0by the United Nations nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency, said Iran had \"significantly increased production and accumulation of high enriched uranium.\"",
      "Last week, Khamenei warned that U.S. threats against his country \"will get them nowhere,\" adding that Americans \"and others should know that if they do anything malign to the Iranian nation, they will get a hard slap.\"",
      "He had previously\u00a0dismissed Mr. Trump's overtures\u00a0for talks, accusing the U.S. president of attempting to deceive global public opinion by portraying the United States as willing to negotiate and Iran as unwilling to engage.",
      "Mr. Trump's first term in office was marked by a particularly troubled period in relations with Tehran. In 2018, he unilaterally withdrew the United States from Iran's nuclear deal with world powers, leading to sanctions hobbling Iran's economy. Iran retaliated with attacks at sea \u2014 including one that it likely carried out and that temporarily halved Saudi Arabia's oil production.",
      "Trump also ordered the attack that killed Iran's top general in a Baghdad drone strike in January 2020.",

      "\"On behalf of the SpaceX team, we're honored to deliver you safely to your polar orbit,\" radioed Bill Gerstenmaier, NASA's former director of space operations and now a senior manager at SpaceX. \"Enjoy the views of the poles, send us some pictures. Our hearts and our minds will be flying with you ... Have a great flight.\"",
      "Who are the private adventurers on the Fram2 mission?",
      "Chun Wang, a Chinese-born citizen of Malta who lives mostly in the extreme north of Norway, paid SpaceX an undisclosed amount to charter the Crew Dragon \"Resilience\" for a trip in polar orbit. The deal marks SpaceX's third privately funded civilian space tourism flight.",
      "\"My own journey has been shaped by lifelong curiosity and a fascination with pushing boundaries,\" Chun (pronounced choon) told reporters Friday. \"As a kid, I used to stare at a blank white space at the bottom of a world map and wonder what's out there.",
      "\"Curiosity eventually took me across the continent and to the southern most tip of Earth in 2021, and also the North Pole in 2023, and now, soon, into space.\" The flight, he added, \"isn't just about going to space. It's about pushing boundaries, sharing knowledge ... and we hope our mission will further inspire later people to do the same.\"",
      "Chun named the mission after the 19th century sailing ship Fram \u2014 \"forward\" in Norwegian \u2014 that carried arctic pioneers to the polar regions in the 1800s. A small piece of Fram's teak decking was carried into space aboard the Crew Dragon.",
      "\"Pretty wild to see the Fram adventurers sailing to the poles once again, over 130 years from (the original ship's) christening,\" SpaceX's launch director radioed the crew. \"This time, though, with Starlink. Cheers.\"",
      "A veteran world traveler, Chun offered the Crew Dragon's three other seats to a trio of explorers he met during a recent polar trip. Jannicke Mikkelsen, a Norwegian cinematographer, is the designated vehicle commander, joined by German roboticist Rabea Rogge as the mission pilot.",
      "The fourth member of the crew is Australian Eric Philips, a professional polar tour guide, adventurer and veteran of some 30 trips to the North and South poles. He is serving as the crew's medical officer.",
      "Some might view the crew as seasoned adventurers and now, space tourists. In an interview with CBS News, Mikkelsen made it clear the crew is well qualified, but she said \"space tourists\" doesn't reflect the extensive training required by SpaceX.",
      "\"I wish it was tourism,\" she said. \"But our education has lasted well over a year, so I have never studied so hard for a three-and-a-half-day expedition in my life.\"",
      "History of private space flights",
      "Chun said he was inspired to book the mission by the example set by entrepreneur Jared Isaacman, the billionaire who chartered SpaceX's first two fully commercial missions, and fellow billionaire Yusaku Maezawa, who flew to the International Space Station aboard a Russian Soyuz spacecraft.",
      "\"I owe my inspiration to Jared,\" Chun posted on X. \"If it weren't for @yousuckMZ and @rookisaacman taking the first step, I would have never had the courage to book an entire spaceship and bring along three people I had only met once before. I also copied many good practices from his previous missions \u2014 hope he doesn't mind.\"",
      "Isaacman, who owns and flies a Russian fighter jet, is the Trump administration's nominee to serve as NASA's next administrator.",
      "Unlike Isaacman, no one on the Fram2 mission is a licensed pilot. While Blue Origin has launched non-pilot crews to the edge of space in sub-orbital New Shepard flights, no crew has flown to orbit without at least one crew member with aviation expertise or astronaut experience.",
      "SpaceX says Fram2 will help refine training procedures aimed at opening up spaceflight to more and more non-professionals.",
      "\"As a roboticist, I'm so hyped about Dragon being an autonomous vehicle which really, I think, shows you how much times are changing in the space sector,\" Rogge said. \"We are really at a crucial point in time where the spacecraft does so many of the tasks itself.",
      "\"I think that really spearheads the accessibility to space, right? Because the dream is (to) have many people in space if we want to live and work there as a civilization.\"",
      "She added, \"right now I think the stereotype of an astronaut is that, you know, super, super, super human, medically perfect. But we should really flip this question and be like, OK, how do we design living and working in space for everyone?\"",
      "Plans for orbiting around the poles",
      "The crew plans to carry out 22 experiments during the flight, ranging from filming auroral displays from orbit to testing compact exercise equipment for use in smaller spacecraft, growing oyster mushrooms in microgravity and taking the first X-rays in space.",
      "Along with three high-end professional cameras, the crew is equipped with four iPad Minis, two iPhone Pro Max cellphones, three laptop computers, a ham radio \"and even an X-ray generator, which we'll use to capture the first-ever X-ray image of the human body in space \u2014 something crucial for future long-duration missions to Mars and beyond,\" Chun posted on X.",
      "Also on board: a Starlink laser terminal mounted in the Crew Dragon's lower trunk section that will give the crew, in theory, data relay speeds of up to 100 gigabytes per second or better.",
      "To reach the planned orbit around the poles, one tilted 90 degrees to Earth's equator, the flight plan called for the Falcon 9 to follow a due-south trajectory carrying the crew above southern Florida, Cuba and Panama on the way to space. The 273-mile-high orbit will allow 55 passes above the poles between launch and splashdown.",
      "Jon Edwards, a SpaceX vice president who oversee Falcon 9 flight operations, said the Crew Dragon's flight software was modified to ensure the vehicle passes safely over populated areas, guiding the rocket as needed to keep the capsule or other components well away from any populated areas in an emergency.",
      "\"We're going to fly out of 39A in Florida and go pretty much straight south,\" Edwards said. \"In fact, the flight path is going to go over Florida. If you were in Miami and you looked straight up, you know, at the right time. would see the rocket and the crew flying right overhead.",
      "\"What we call the instantaneous impact points, which is where, if we cut power, it would land, that will stay offshore, so it's totally safe to do this. But it will be flying over Florida and over Cuba and Panama and just to the west of Peru and Ecuador.\"",
      "NASA and the U.S. Space Force routinely launch military satellites and science probes into polar orbits from Vandenberg Space Force Base in California, where rockets can fly due south over the Pacific Ocean without passing over populated areas.",
      "But the maximum inclination for orbital payloads launched from the East Coast has traditionally been limited to avoid flying over areas where debris from a catastrophic failure might fall. In recent years, SpaceX has launched satellites into polar or near-polar orbits from Cape Canaveral, but no piloted flights.",
      "While NASA and the Air Force once planned to launch space shuttles into polar orbit from Vandenberg, the military space program changed priorities in the wake of the 1986 Challenge disaster and those plans were shelved six months before the initial flight.",
      "The polar orbit will provide spectacular views for the Fram2 crew that Mikkelsen plans to document, from the ice caps to shimmering auroras. The public is invited to share the experience, photographing auroras at the same time Fram2 is capturing the view from space.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/stuck-astronauts-speak-out-after-return/",
    "published": "Mon, 31 Mar 2025 20:30:56 -0400",
    "summary": "NASA astronauts Butch Wilmore and Sunita Williams, who were stuck in space for more than nine months, took questions after returning to Earth.",
    "story": [
      "Starliner astronauts Butch Wilmore and Sunita Williams, speaking out at a news conference for the first time since returning to Earth after an extended 286-day stay in space, said Monday they did not blame Boeing for the spacecraft problems that effectively stranded them aboard the International Space Station.",
      "In fact, asked if he would fly again aboard the Starliner, Wilmore said, \"Yes, because we're going to rectify all the issues that we encountered. We're going to fix them. We're going to make it work. Boeing is completely committed. NASA is completely committed, and with that, I'd get on in a heartbeat.\"",
      "Added Williams: \"I would agree. The spacecraft is really capable. There were a couple things that need to be fixed ... and folks are actively working on that, but it is a great spacecraft, and it has a lot of capability that other spacecraft don't have. To see that thing successful and to be part of that program is an honor.\"",
      "Asked if he blamed Boeing for the propulsion system helium leaks and thruster problems that ultimately led NASA to bring the Starliner down without its crew, extending their stay aboard the space station from eight days to more than nine-and-a-half months, Wilmore said, \"That is a question that I cannot answer in a couple of comments. But I'll start with me.\"",
      "\"There were questions that I, as the commander of the spacecraft, that I should have asked, and I did not. At the time, I didn't know I needed to. And maybe you could call that hindsight, but I'll start and point the finger and I'll blame me. I could have asked some questions and the answers to those questions could have turned the tide.",
      "\"So blame, I don't like that term, but certainly there's responsibility throughout all the programs and certainly you can start with me. Responsibility with Boeing? Yes. Responsibility with NASA? Yes. All the way up and down the chain. We all are responsible. We all own this.\"",
      "Their repeatedly extended mission generated enormous attention in the wake of problems with Starliner, NASA's decision three months after launch to keep them in orbit until this year, and comments from President Trump claiming the astronauts had been \"abandoned\" in space by the Biden administration.",
      "Williams denied feeling \"abandoned\" or \"stuck\" during an interview with CBS News in February, saying she was \"honored ... to be here and a part of the team\" doing \"world-class science.\" They said much of the same Monday. But they avoided answering questions about the political aspects of the mission.",
      "Wilmore and Williams returned to Earth on March 18, accompanied by two outgoing station fliers who were wrapping up their own six-month stay aboard the lab. The Starliner astronauts, like all returning station fliers, began physical therapy back at the Johnson Space Center to help them readjust to gravity.",
      "They both looked fit and were in obviously good spirits talking with reporters Monday. In fact, Williams said she went for a 3-mile run on Sunday.",
      "How long were the astronauts stuck in space?",
      "By the time they splashed down off Florida's Gulf Coast, Wilmore and Williams had spent 286 days in space.",
      "While the extended mission was much longer than originally planned, it ranks sixth on the list of longest flights by U.S. astronauts.",
      "The record is held by astronaut Frank Rubio, whose planned six-month stay aboard the space station was extended to just over a full year \u2014 371 days \u2014 because of coolant leaks in the Russian Soyuz that carried him to orbit. He came back to Earth aboard a replacement Soyuz in September 2023.",
      "Even though his record remains unbroken, problems with the Boeing Starliner that carried Wilmore and Williams to space triggered extensive coverage in the United States that far exceeded the coverage of Rubio's even longer mission.",
      "Why were the astronauts stuck in space so long?",
      "Three years after the space shuttle's retirement in 2011, NASA awarded multibillion-dollar contracts to Boeing and SpaceX to build ferry ships to carry astronauts to and from the space station. SpaceX has now launched 11 piloted Crew Dragon flights for NASA and five purely commercial missions. A sixth commercial launch is currently scheduled for Monday night.",
      "But Boeing ran into multiple problems with its Starliner that required two unpiloted test flights before Wilmore, who is 62, and Williams, 59, both former military test pilots, were finally cleared to launch last June 5 on the spacecraft's first piloted mission after engineers decided a small helium leak in the ship's propulsion pressurization system would not get worse.",
      "The astronauts successfully docked with the space station the next day, but the Starliner experienced additional helium propulsion system leaks and several maneuvering jets did not produce the expected thrust.",
      "While the flight originally was expected to last about eight days, NASA and Boeing carried out weeks of tests and analysis to determine what caused the problems and whether the spacecraft could be trusted to safely bring its crew back to Earth.",
      "By August, Boeing managers were convinced engineers understood the problems and the crew could, in fact, safely come home in the Starliner.",
      "But NASA managers eventually ruled out that option and decided to keep the astronauts aboard the station until early this year when they could hitch a ride home aboard a Crew Dragon. That spacecraft was launched last September with just two crew members on board, along with two empty seats for Wilmore and Williams.",
      "The Starliner, meanwhile, successfully returned to Earth earlier in September, kicking off hands-on troubleshooting and ongoing work to prepare for the eventual resumption of flights.",
      "Wilmore, Williams, Crew 9 Dragon commander Nick Hague and cosmonaut Alexander Gorbunov originally planned to return to Earth in February. But the Crew 10 Dragon needed to carry their replacements to the station ran into problems of its own and the flight was delayed to the end of March.",
      "Those problems, and the threat of additional delays, prompted NASA to switch the Crew 10 fliers to a different Crew Dragon, eventually moving its launch up to March 12, paving the way for Crew 9 to head home.",

    "story": [
      "A test rocket aimed at building the ability to launch satellites from Europe crashed about 40 seconds after takeoff from a Norwegian spaceport on Sunday.",
      "The unmanned Spectrum rocket, an orbital rocket developed by German start-up Isar Aerospace, started smoking from its sides and then crashed back to Earth with a powerful explosion after launching from Norway's Andoya Spaceport in the Arctic. The company called the test flight a success.",
      "\"Our first test flight met all our expectations, achieving a great success,\" Daniel Metzler, Isar's chief executive and co-founder, said in a news release. \"We had a clean liftoff, 30 seconds of flight and even got to validate our Flight Termination System.\"",
      "The company said the two-stage rocket fell into the sea, adding that \"the launch pad seems to be intact\".",
      "Orbital rockets are designed to place loads such as satellites into or beyond Earth's orbit.",
      "Spectrum's blast-off was the first of an orbital launch vehicle from the European continent, excluding Russia, and Europe's first financed almost exclusively by the private sector.",
      "The launch had been repeatedly postponed due to weather conditions, and Isar Aerospace had downplayed expectations.",
      "\"Every second we fly is good because we collect data and experience. Thirty seconds would already be a great success,\" Metzler, said ahead of the launch.",
      "\"We do not expect to reach orbit with this test. In fact, no company has yet managed to put its first orbital launch vehicle into orbit.\"",
      "The 92-foot two-stage rocket was not carrying any load for the test flight.",
      "Isar Aerospace is separate from the European Space Agency, or ESA, which is funded by its 23 member states, the Associated Press reported.",
      "ESA has been launching rockets and satellites into orbit for years, but mainly from French Guiana \u2014 an overseas department of France in South America \u2014 and from Cape Canaveral in Florida.",
      "A first European orbital launch attempt was made in 2023 by billionaire entrepreneur Richard Branson's Virgin Orbit. It attempted to use a Boeing 747 to launch a rocket into orbit from southwest England, but failed, leading the company to fold.",

    "story": [
      "Top Democrats on the House Science, Space and Technology Committee are sounding the alarm about cuts to a little-known but rapidly expanding space office within NOAA as part of the hundreds of recent layoffs at the agency.",
      "NOAA's Office of Space Commerce is tasked with helping to manage commercial and military satellite traffic in space to help guard against collisions, as well as licensing and regulating commercial satellite systems. The office has recently gotten attention around Washington as a key government office for commercial space companies.",
      "Its already small team lost eight employees in the initial round of layoffs in late February, representing around 30% of its staff, according to multiple sources. Since then, three staffers in leadership roles were brought back, but lawmakers still worry about the impact.",
      "The members of Congress are calling for all fired employees within the office to be reinstated permanently. Earlier this month, fired employees were placed on administrative leave after their firings were blocked by a federal court ruling.",
      "In a letter to Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, obtained by CBS News, lawmakers including the committee's ranking member Zoe Lofgren, of California, say the firings could compromise the office's public safety programs and risk hurting U.S. leadership in space.",
      "They also question whether there's a conflict of interest given Trump adviser and DOGE leader Elon Musk's stake in SpaceX.",
      "\"If OSC is gutted, the harm to America's economy, its national security, and its public safety will leave everyone worse off \u2014 except perhaps for SpaceX, whose size and scale will allow it to mitigate the damage done to the rest of the commercial space sector,\" reads the letter in part.",
      "\"As the largest and most profitable commercial satellite operator, SpaceX has already achieved a size and scale that far surpasses its competitors, thereby positioning the company to withstand market disruptions and uncertainty with much greater ease than its less-established rivals,\" it continues.",
      "In addition to Lofgren, the letter is signed by Democratic House members Valerie Foushee, of North Carolina, the ranking member of the Subcommittee on Space and Aeronautics; and Emilia Sykes, of Ohio, the ranking member of the subcommittee on Investigations & Oversight.",
      "Former NOAA officials also say the steep cuts to the office appear to be at odds with policy goals set out under the first Trump administration to help manage increasing commercial and civil space traffic.",
      "Admiral Timothy Gallaudet, who served as acting administrator of NOAA during the first Trump administration, called the cuts \"self-defeating,\" since the office was established to help support a growing commercial space sector. Gallaudet now works as a consultant for space companies.",
      "\"One of our goals, broadly, was to support these growing tech industries. One of them was space, and we grew,\" Gallaudet told CBS News. \"If that office has employees fired, that means it's going to take more time for them to issue licenses to new companies.\"",
      "Project 2025, the Heritage Foundation's conservative policy playbook, even called for Republicans to \"elevate\" the Office of Space Commerce, saying the office \"should be the vehicle for a new Administration to set a robust and unified whole-of-government commercial space policy that cements U.S. leadership in one of the most crucial industries of the future.\"",
      "One of the employees who remains on leave, Cole Donovan, served as an international affairs specialist within the Office of Space Commerce. His work focused on regulations and coordination between private space companies in the United States and the European Union.",
      "\"For my division, specifically, we don't have an expert anymore on EU law and EU regulation,\" he said. \"We had been helping U.S. companies navigate that process.\"",
      "Committee Democrats have asked Secretary Lutnick whether impacts to the U.S. space industry were assessed before the firings took place. They also asked whether any communications occurred between SpaceX representatives and officials from the Department of Commerce, NOAA or the Office of Space Commerce.",
      "The lawmakers also want to know whether the Office of Space Commerce will be compelled to grant DOGE access to proprietary data from SpaceX competitors that could potentially be disclosed to Musk and SpaceX.",
      "\"These unprecedented conflicts of interest threaten to destabilize the entire U.S. commercial space sector if they are not immediately addressed,\" they write in the letter.",

      "Susan Crawford, who was endorsed by the Democratic Party, won the closely-watched Wisconsin Supreme Court race Tuesday night in what was the most expensive judicial election in American history.",
      "What would have normally been a sleepy nonpartisan judicial race turned into an expensive battle between Crawford, a Dane County judge, and Waukesha County Judge Brad Schimel, who was endorsed by the Republican Party. The campaigns and their supporters have spent more than $81 million, attracting endorsements and campaign appearances from Elon Musk, Vermont Democratic Sen. Bernie Sanders and other national political figures.",
      "With 91% of the vote in, Crawford led Schimel by 54% to 45%, a margin of about 184,000 votes.",
      "The race was seen by some as an early swing-state test of voter sentiment related to President Trump's performance in the White House, but also a crucial statewide race that could swing ideological control of Wisconsin's closely divided highest court.",
      "Going into the race, liberals held a 4-3 majority, and the court is expected to consider cases related to abortion rights, congressional redistricting, union power and voting and election rules.",
      "By Monday morning, 644,800 advance ballots had been returned, representing about a 40% increase over the advance total in Wisconsin's 2023 judicial race, and that year also set a turnout record. About a third of advance ballots so far have come from heavily Democratic counties of Milwaukee and Dane, in the Madison area, and that's roughly in line with their share of the advance vote in 2023.",
      "Nineteen percent of advance ballots had come from the WOW counties in the Milwaukee suburbs of Waukesha, Ozaukee, and Washington, which is a couple of points higher than their share in 2023.",
      "Given that the more liberal candidate won the 2023 race by double digits, the early turnout numbers looked good for Crawford. But the bulk of the voting occurred on Election Day.",
      "Musk, the world's wealthiest person and an ally to Mr. Trump, personally campaigned and spent big in an effort to sway voters toward Schimel, who both he and Mr. Trump have endorsed.",
      "That effort nearly collided with the justices currently seated on the state's Supreme Court, when Musk was sued over his promise to hand out $1 million to individual voters at a campaign event over the weekend.",
      "The court unanimously declined on Sunday to hear a last-minute attempt by the state's Democratic attorney general to stop billionaire Musk's checks from going out. At a rally soon after the decision, Musk handed two people oversized posters depicting $1 million checks, declaring that the money was payment in exchange for promises they'd be spokespeople for his political group.",

      "A federal judge has ruled that the legal battle over Mahmoud Khalil's deportation should continue to play out in New Jersey, rejecting the Trump administration's bid to transfer the Columbia University protester's case to Louisiana.",
      "In a written decision Tuesday, U.S. District Judge Michael Farbiarz in Newark said jurisdiction over the case should remain in New Jersey since Khalil was being held there at the time his lawyer's filed their Habeas Corpus petition.",
      "\"The Court's jurisdiction is not defeated by the Petitioner having been moved to Louisiana,\" the judge wrote, describing the government's argument otherwise as \"unpersuasive.\"",
      "The ruling does not guarantee that Khalil will be moved out of a detention facility in Louisiana, where he is being held as the government seeks his deportation for his role in campus protests against Israel. But it will allow his attorneys to make their arguments for his transfer or release before a judge in New Jersey.",
      "If the case were to go forward in Louisiana, it may have ultimately ended up before one of the nation's most conservative appeals courts, possibly allowing those judges to issue a precedent-setting ruling on both Khalil's case and the Trump administration's broader efforts to deport noncitizen student activists.",
      "The Justice Department has not yet responded to CBS News New York's requests for comment.",
      "\"There is still a lot more to be done\"",
      "\"I am relieved at the court's decision today to keep my husband's ongoing case in New Jersey. This is an important step towards securing Mahmoud's freedom, but there is still a lot more to be done,\" Khalil's wife Dr. Noor Abdalla said. \"What happened to Mahmoud is a violation of his rights as a lawful permanent resident of this country. ICE agents ripped him from our home and took him across state lines to Louisiana, violating his rights and holding him as a political prisoner.\"",

      "\"Today we moved one step closer to vindicating Mr. Khalil's rights by challenging his unlawful detention and the administration's unconstitutional and retaliatory actions against him,\" Khalil's attorney Amy Greer said.",
      "\"Everything that's critical to this case happened here [in New Jersey],\" said Amy Belsher, one of the attorneys representing Khalil. \"Really, the only reason, the only tie to Louisiana is it's because the government thinks that that is a better venue for them.\"",
      "\"We are grateful the court wisely understood that the government cannot try to manipulate the jurisdiction of the United States courts in a transparent attempt to shield their unconstitutional \u2013 and frankly chilling \u2013 behavior. We look forward to the next phase of this case, which is to get Mahmoud out of detention and into the arms of his family, and then to prove the Trump administration's attempted deportation of Mahmoud and others is nothing but unconstitutional retaliation for protected speech,\" Bazer Azmy of the Center for Constitutional Rights said.",
      "Khalil, a legal U.S. resident, was detained by federal immigration agents on March 8 in the lobby of his university-owned apartment. It was the first arrest under President Donald Trump's promised crackdown on students who joined campus protests against the war in Gaza.",

      "Washington \u2014 Republicans' slim majority in the House grew a little larger Tuesday after GOP candidates in two Florida congressional districts won in special elections.",
      "Republican state Sen. Randy Fine defeated Democrat Josh Weil for the 6th District seat formerly held by Mike Waltz, who left to become President Trump's national security adviser. Waltz had won the seat by more than 30 points in November, but Fine's margin was less, around 14 points ahead of Weil, with 99% of votes counted Tuesday night.",
      "In the 1st District, Republican Jimmy Patronis, the state's chief financial officer, defeated Democrat Gay Valimont, a gun control activist, for the seat vacated by Matt Gaetz.",

      "The race to replace former Rep. Mike Waltz, who resigned from his seat in Florida's 6th Congressional District to become Mr. Trump's national security adviser, had initially appeared unexpectedly competitive.",
      "Democrat Josh Weil, a public school teacher, significantly outraised Republican Randy Fine, with Weil raising more than $9 million through mid-March compared to Fine, who brought in less than $1 million, according to Federal Election Commission filings.",
      "The race gained more attention last week when Waltz appeared at the center of a Signal group chat leak, when Jeffrey Goldberg, the editor of The Atlantic, revealed that he was added to a group on the encrypted messaging app and observed as top Trump officials discussed sensitive plans to strike targets in Yemen.",
      "The race attracted serious fundraising from Democrats, and was in the spotlight after\u00a0President Trump withdrew Rep. Elise Stefanik's name\u00a0from consideration for U.N. ambassador to avoid risking further depleting his party's already narrow majority.",
      "In withdrawing the appointment of Stefanik, a New York Republican who has been among Mr. Trump's most loyal voices in Congress, the president explained that he didn't want to risk further depleting the already narrow majority.",

      "The other special election, in Florida's 1st Congressional District in the state's Panhandle, fills the vacancy left by former Rep. Matt Gaetz, whose nomination to be attorney general was derailed by a House Ethics Committee report that alleged sexual misconduct and illicit drug use. Gaetz, who denied any wrongdoing, withdrew his name from consideration, although he had already resigned from Congress.",
      "The race in the heavily Republican district, which was seen as less competitive, despite sizeable funding for Democrat Gay Valimont. Republican Jimmy Patronis had raised $2.1 million as of mid-March compared to Valimont's nearly $6.5 million, according to FEC filings.",

      "\"Luigi Mangione's murder of Brian Thompson \u2014 an innocent man and father of two young children \u2014 was a premeditated, cold-blooded assassination that shocked America. After careful consideration, I have directed federal prosecutors to seek the death penalty in this case as we carry out President Trump's agenda to stop violent crime and Make America Safe Again,\" Bondi said in a statement Tuesday.",

While claiming to protect against murder, the federal government moves to commit the pre-meditated, state-sponsored murder of Luigi. By doing this, they are defending the broken, immoral, and murderous healthcare industry that continues to terrorize the American people,\" Mangione's attorney Karen Agnifilo said in a statement. \"We are prepared to fight these federal charges, brought by a lawless Justice Department, as well as the New York State charges, and the Pennsylvania charges, and anything else they want to pile on Luigi. This is a corrupt web of government dysfunction and one-upmanship. Luigi is caught in a high-stakes game of tug-of-war between state and federal prosecutors, except the trophy is a young man's life.\"",

    "summary": "Democratic Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey began speaking around 7 p.m. on Monday to protest Trump policies and didn't stop till after 8 p.m. on Tuesday.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014\u00a0Democratic Sen. Cory Booker delivered a record-breaking marathon speech on the Senate floor, which started Monday evening and continued more than 25 hours before wrapping up Tuesday night, in a protest against the Trump administration's policies.",
      "At 25 hours and five minutes, the speech now marks the longest on Senate record, surpassing Sen. Strom Thurmond's 24 hour and 18 minute address in 1957.",
      "While many senators have historically used long speeches to filibuster a bill or nomination, Booker's speech was not a filibuster since it did not occur during debate on a specific measure to block proceedings.",
      "Booker, a 55-year-old who first came to the Senate in 2013 and is now the fourth-ranking Democrat, began speaking around 7 p.m. on Monday and said he would continue speaking \"for as long as I am physically able.\" As the sun rose on Tuesday morning and then throughout the day, he was still speaking from the Senate floor. Booker's office in a news release said he came into the speech with 1,164 pages of prepared material for the occasion.",
      "He passed the record-breaking mark at 7:19 p.m. ET, but kept on going, finally yielding the floor at 8:05 p.m.",
      "The Senate chamber erupted in applause as Booker broke the record, as Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer rose to mark the moment.",
      "\"Do you know how proud this caucus is of you, do you know how proud America is of you?\" Schumer said.",
      "Booker cited the legacy of leaders, like late congressman and civil rights activist John Lewis, whom he said stood up \"when this country was facing crossroads, was facing crises, they stood up.\"",
      "\"I rise today in an unusual manner,\" Booker said, before invoking Lewis' refrain to \"get in good trouble, necessary trouble, help redeem the soul of America.\"",
      "\"Tonight, I rise with the intention of getting in some good trouble,\" Booker said at the outset, pledging to disrupt the normal business of the Senate. \"I rise tonight because I believe sincerely that our country is in crisis\u2026 These are not normal times in America, and they should not be treated as such.\"",
      "More than 24 hours later, Booker was still speaking.",
      "The New Jersey Democrat spent some of that time reading letters from constituents who say they have been harmed by the Trump administration's policies, and condemning the administration more broadly \u2014 from trade wars to mass firings to deportations and threats to Medicaid.",
      "Booker occasionally yielded to his Democratic colleagues on the floor, including Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York and Senators Lisa Blunt Rochester of Delaware, Andy Kim of New Jersey, Peter Welch of Vermont, Dick Durbin of Illinois and Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, as they echoed his concerns with the administration and encouraged his effort.",
      "Still, Booker was not permitted to leave the Senate floor without risking control and continuation of his speech. He later explained to reporters that he stopped eating on Friday and stopped drinking water a day before delivering the speech to prepare for the extended time without a bathroom break.",
      "After 7 a.m. Tuesday, Booker acknowledged the 12 hours that had passed, saying he was \"wide awake\" and would \"stand here for as many hours as I can.\" At noon, the Senate briefly paused for the chaplain to say a prayer, as is required under Senate rules during a continuous session. Booker continued to hold the floor.",
      "Asked by Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse how he was doing after the 17-hour mark, Booker said, \"I shall not complain.\"",
      "About 23 hours in, he joked, \"I, first amongst us all, really love to speak.\"",
      "As he approached the record, Booker thanked Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut for standing by him during nearly the entirety of the speech, while recalling Murphy's filibuster in 2016.",
      "\"You stood, and I stood with you,\" Booker said. \"And he said to me days ago, 'if you're going to do this, brother, I will your aide-de-camp this time.'\"",
      "Murphy marked the historic moment, noting that the previous record was set when Thurmond was fighting against civil rights and making the case for \"why this nation should continue to segregate Black and White.\"",
      "\"What you have done here today Sen. Booker couldn't be more different than what occurred on this floor in 1957,\" Murphy said. \"Today you are standing in the way not of progress, but of retreat.\"",
      "At the 24-hour mark, Booker brought his message back to Lewis and the \"good trouble\" that he invoked on Monday.",
      "\"This is the moment, generations get them, we're at a crossroads here, folks,\" Booker said, minutes before the record-breaking moment.",
      "Several members of the Congressional Black Caucus and other House members came to the floor at various intervals to observe the Senator's speech in the rear of the chamber, including Reps. Steven Horsford, Maxine Waters, Jonathan Jackson, Bonnie Watson Coleman, Sean Casten, Steve Cohen.",
      "Booker appeared to grow emotional as he surpassed Thurmond's record, saying he was not here because of Thurman's speech, but \"despite his speech.\"",
      "\"I'm here because as powerful as he was, the people were more powerful.\"",
      "What was the longest floor speech in Senate history?",
      "Prior to Booker's new record today, Sen. Strom Thurmond of South Carolina delivered the longest Senate speech on record, with a more than 24-hour filibuster in 1957. Thurmond carried out his filibuster in an effort to block civil rights legislation.",
      "Booker's marathon speech earlier eclipsed lengthy speeches delivered in recent years, including 21-hour filibuster by Sen. Ted Cruz in 2013 on Obamacare, and a 15-hour filibuster by Murphy on gun control.",

    "story": [
      "President Trump has argued that some of the tariffs he's imposing this week could help the government raise over $1 trillion in the next year or so, helping to reduce the national debt and even potentially offset some income taxes.",
      "But economists are skeptical that these tariffs can bring in as much as Mr. Trump claims, as consumers will likely reduce their spending on foreign goods when prices go up.",
      "Tariffs are often charged as a percentage of the price that importers pay foreign sellers. They aren't paid by foreign nations, but by U.S. companies who often pass the cost to American consumers by raising prices.",
      "\"You're going to see billions of dollars, even trillions of dollars coming into our country very soon in the form of tariffs,\" the president said last week.",
      "While economic analyses indicate Mr. Trump's tariffs could meaningfully increase annual tariff revenue, the president's trillion-dollar estimates are significantly higher than those provided by think tanks and even some of his own officials.",
      "How much Trump's new auto tariffs could generate",
      "In a recent news conference, White House staff secretary Will Sharf estimated that Mr. Trump's 25% tariff on vehicles and auto parts imported into the U.S. could raise \"roughly $100 billion in new revenue.\" At the same news conference, Mr. Trump claimed moments later \"anywhere from $600 billion to $1 trillion will be taken in over the relatively short-term period, meaning a year from now.\"",
      "The White House did not respond to a request to clarify the source of the discrepancy.",
      "The Yale Budget Lab, a nonpartisan think tank, has estimated that the auto tariffs could raise roughly $600 billion to $650 billion over a period of 10 years \u2014 not in a single year, as Mr. Trump suggested.",
      "\"On an annual basis on average that's $60 to 65 billion. We're not even close to trillions,\" said Ernie Tedeschi, director of economics at the Yale Budget Lab.",

      "The same researchers found Mr. Trump's 25% tariff on goods from Canada and Mexico, which are slated to go into effect this week, along with the additional 20% tax on Chinese imports that the president has already put in place, could generate roughly $150 billion annually, or up to $1.5 trillion over 10 years. They also found the average household could lose $1,600 to $2,000 each year in inflation-adjusted disposable income as a result of higher prices.",
      "Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs previously made higher estimates that Trump's increased tariffs on these countries could generate roughly $300 billion in new income per year.",
      "Either would be a meaningful increase over the $88 billion in customs duties collected at ports of entry in 2024.",
      "However, economists argue there's a ceiling to tariff revenue that remains below $1 trillion per year.",
      "The U.S. imported about $3.3 trillion in foreign goods last year, according to the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis. The Peterson Institute of International Economics estimated that even if Mr. Trump were to apply a 50% tariff to foreign imports from every country \u2014 which exceeds his stated plans \u2014 it would generate at most about $780 billion annually.",
      "\"If you make something 50% more expensive, you don't expect people to buy the same amount,\" said Kimberly Clausing, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute.",
      "Could tariff revenue replace income taxes?",

      "\"Under the American first economic model, as tariffs on other countries go up, taxes on American workers and businesses will come down,\" Trump said in a speech to the House GOP in January.",
      "Income taxes generate over $2 trillion per year, according to the Department of the Treasury. Even if a president imposed 50% tariffs on all imports, the income generated would represent less than 40% of what income taxes bring in, according to the Peterson Institute.",
      "\"The problem is it can't raise anywhere near the amount of revenue you'd need to scuttle the income tax. And that's the really, I think, ironclad point,\" said Scott Lincicome, a vice president of general economics and trade at the Cato Institute, which is a libertarian think tank.",
      "Historians on U.S. trade note that tariffs have not been viewed as a primary way to raise revenue since income taxes were introduced in 1913.",
      "In 2024, tariff collections on imports represented just 1.7% of the more than $4.9 trillion in total federal revenue. And according to the Congressional Research Service, tariffs have not accounted for much more than 2% of federal revenue in the last 70 years.",

    "summary": "President Trump is expected on April 2 to announce reciprocal tariffs on a number of other countries. Here's what to know about these import taxes.",
    "story": [
      "A core element of the protectionist trade policies President Trump is scheduled to announce on Wednesday \u2014 a planned import tax blitz he has referred to as \"Liberation Day\" \u2014 are so-called reciprocal tariffs. Mr. Trump has touted such levies as a way to level the playing field with other countries that impose higher tariffs on U.S. imports, as well as to boost domestic manufacturers.",
      "But some economists say that tit-for-tat tariffs with key trading partners could be hard to structure, while also roiling global commerce and driving up costs\u00a0for U.S. consumers and businesses. Here's what to know about reciprocal tariffs.",
      "What are reciprocal tariffs?",
      "Truly reciprocal tariffs would impose the same tax on U.S. imports that other countries charge on American exports on a product by product basis. For example, if a country imposed a 6% levy on American-made shoes, Mr. Trump would tax that nation's footwear at the same rate.",
      "Currently, the U.S. and its trading partners charge each other different levies on the same products. Germany, for instance, puts higher tariffs on vehicles made in the U.S. than what Washington, D.C., charges on German vehicle imports.",
      "\"Reciprocal means that if a country has higher tariffs than we do on certain products, we would raise it to that level,\" Alex Jacquez, chief of policy and advocacy at Groundwork Collaborative, a left-leaning public policy think tank, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "That would be administratively complex given the tens of thousands of codes that determine the tariff rates on a variety of products.",
      "\"Setting up reciprocal tariffs across every product category with every trade partner would be completely infeasible with our administrative capacity,\" Jacquez said.",
      "Are reciprocal tariffs the same as country-based tariffs?",
      "Rather than impose perfectly reciprocal tariffs, the White House could instead announce country-specific tariff rates calibrated to the their trade imbalance with the U.S.",
      "\"They will probably come up with a blended rate that is not reciprocal by product, but is reciprocal by saying their tariffs are 10% higher than ours on average, so we'll be imposing 10% tariff across-the-board on all goods,\" said Jacquez, who formerly worked as an economic policy analyst in the Biden administration.",
      "That approach could result in the U.S. taxing other nations' products at vastly different rate than they do ours.",
      "\"It will hit a lot of products very differently in a proximate way, because it would be balanced by country but not by import or export,\" Jacquez said. \"That is where complications will arise, and you could see a scenario in which countries retaliate against us.\"",
      "Who are the \"Dirty 15\"?",
      "Trump administration officials have singled out a group of nations they dubbed the \"Dirty 15,\"\u00a0 a reference to the 15% of countries expected to be hit hardest by the new reciprocal tariffs given their trade surplus with the U.S.",
      "Those nations account for \"a huge amount of our trading volume,\" U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told Fox News' Maria Bartiromo on March 18, without naming the trade partners.",
      "National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett also told Fox News that the White House is targeting 10 to 15 nations with the biggest trade surplus with the U.S. Like Bessent, he also refrained from naming those nations.",
      "In 2024, the largest U.S. trade deficits around the globe \u2014 meaning countries from which the U.S. imports more than it exports \u2014 was with the following nations, according to federal data:",

      "Sweden ($9.8 billion)",
      "Are reciprocal prices likely to drive up consumer prices?",
      "Experts say reciprocal tariffs would mean added costs for U.S. businesses, which in turn would likely raise consumer prices in order to protect their profit margins.",
      "\"Tariffs are a tax on a business bringing a product into the country. When they receive it at a port of entry, whether it be an airport or seaport, they have to pay the duty to have it admitted into the country,\" Chris Barrett, a professor at Cornell SC Johnson School of Business, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"You've just added a cost on for the business, and those costs get passed on, at least to some degree, to consumers.\"",
      "How much prices could rise remains unclear. Meanwhile, prices could fall if Mr. Trump later lowers or removes reciprocal tariffs following trade negotiations.",
      "But when there is no good substitute for a particular good, consumer costs are likely to rise more sharply.",
      "\"The more price insensitive they are, the more likely they are to shoulder the burden of the tax,\" Barrett said.",

      "The plan would consolidate agencies that oversee billions of dollars for addiction services and community health centers across the country under a new office called the Administration for a Healthy America.",
      "As CBS News reported last week, the layoffs are expected to shrink HHS to 62,000 positions, lopping off nearly a quarter of its staff \u2014 10,000 jobs through layoffs and another 10,000 workers who took early retirement and voluntary separation offers. That's down from around 92,620 employees at the department in September 2024, according to federal\u00a0records. There were 81,917 at the end of the first Trump administration.",

      "Beyond layoffs at federal health agencies, cuts are beginning to happen at state and local health departments as a result of an HHS move last week to pull back more than $11 billion in COVID-19-related funds.

    "summary": "Top ICE official calls removal of Kilmar Abrego Garcia on deportation flight that sent him to a supermax prison in El Salvador an \"administrative error.\"",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration admitted in a court filing Monday that an \"administrative error\" and an \"oversight\" resulted in a Salvadoran man's deportation and imprisonment in a supermax prison in El Salvador, despite a legal order prohibiting his removal there.",
      "Acting Immigration and Customs Enforcement field office director Robert Cerna said that Kilmar Abrego Garcia was removed from the U.S. on March 15 as part of a series of deportation flights that sent hundreds of alleged gang members to a notorious prison in El Salvador, even though an immigration judge had granted him a legal protection from deportation.",
      "Those flights are at the center of a court battle between the Justice Department and U.S. District Court Judge James Boasberg, who blocked further deportations of alleged Tren de Aragua gang members under the Trump administration's invocation of the Alien Enemies Act of 1798.",
      "The March 15 deportation flights transported 238 Venezuelas and 23 Salvadorans, all of whom Trump administration officials described as members of the Tren de Aragua and MS-13 gangs. Lawyers and relatives of many of the Venezuelans have strongly denied claims that their clients and loved ones are gang members.",
      "The filings were made as part of a suit filed by attorneys for Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran man and Maryland resident who received a legal status known as \"withholding of removal\" in 2019 after an immigration judge found that Abrego Garcia, who left his native country in 2011 at age 16, could face persecution by gangs if deported to El Salvador. His case was first reported by The Atlantic late Monday.",
      "Although the Trump administration concedes it made a mistake when it deported Abrego Garcia, it is opposing a request for him to be brought back to the U.S. The government has argued Abrego Garcia is a danger to the community, alleging that he's a member of the MS-13 gang.",
      "The Justice Department has also argued that federal courts lack the authority to facilitate Abrego Garcia's return, since he's now being held by the Salvadoran government and no longer in U.S. custody. Even if they did have the power to order his return, the Justice Department said in a filing, there has been \"no showing that El Salvador is even inclined to consider a request to release a detainee at the United States' request.\"",
      "Attorney Simon Sandoval-Mosheberg called the Trump administration's refusal to try to get his client back \"appalling.\"",
      "\"I've had wrongful deportation cases before, including in the last Trump administration and in every single such case, as soon as they realize what they've done, they bent over backwards,\" he told CBS News.",
      "Abrego Garcia was living in Maryland, alongside his wife and their disabled 5-year-old son, both of whom are U.S. citizens, according to the court filings submitted by his lawyers. Before he was arrested by ICE last month, Abrego Garcia was routinely attending check-ins with the agency, the filings said. His lawyers said he has no criminal record in the U.S., a finding the government has not disputed.",
      "In 2019, Abrego Garcia was standing outside of a Home Depot in Hyattsville, Maryland, soliciting work with three other men when he was arrested. His attorney said he was questioned about whether he was a gang member, and when he told police he was not, the police said they didn't believe him and said they were calling ICE.",
      "During immigration proceedings, Abrego Garcia's attorneys said the only evidence the government provided in support of his gang affiliation was that he was wearing a Chicago Bulls hat and hoodie and that a confidential informant said he was an active MS-13 member in a branch of the gang that operates on Long Island, New York, where Abrego Garcia's attorneys say he has never lived.",
      "\"He's not a gang member. The allegations against him are based on whispers and shadows,\" Sandoval-Mosheberg said.",
      "Abrego Garcia's attorneys wrote in their initial complaint\u00a0that their client's name was not included in a Hyattsville City Police Department report about the Home Depot arrest, and said that the detective who authored the gang affiliation part of the report had been suspended.",
      "An immigration judge ruled that the informant's testimony was \"proven and reliable,\" but said that he should not be deported to El Salvador.",
      "In a statement Tuesday, a Department of Homeland Security spokesperson said Abrego Garcia is \"a member of the brutal MS-13 gang and was reportedly involved in human trafficking. Whether he be in El Salvador or a detention facility in the U.S. he should be locked up.\"",
      "Vice President JD Vance responded to media reports about the deportation on Tuesday, posting on X that \"It is telling that the entire American media is going to run a propaganda operation today making you think an innocent 'father of 3' was apprehended by a gulag,\" adding that Abrego Garcia \"is an illegal immigrant with no right to be in our country.\"",

    "story": [
      "President Trump's controversial choice to be the top federal prosecutor in Washington, D.C., Ed Martin, faces an uncertain future, as a Senate Democrat plans to put an indefinite hold on his nomination.",
      "Martin, a \"Stop the Steal\" advocate and former defense attorney who represented U.S. Capitol riot defendants, is Mr. Trump's nominee to be U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia, and Sen. Adam Schiff, a first-term Democrat from California, plans to hold his nomination amid a growing number of controversial statements and decisions by Martin.",
      "The position is among the highest-profile and most powerful federal prosecutor positions in the U.S. Martin, who refers to himself as \"Ed the Eagle,\" has been serving as acting U.S. attorney for D.C. since Inauguration Day.",
      "Senators have the power to invoke a hold on a presidential nominee, a maneuver that can slow or stall consideration of a nominee for days or weeks. Precious Senate floor time is often needed to overcome holds on presidential nominees.",
      "\"For the past nine weeks, Ed Martin has consistently undermined the independence and abused the power of the US Attorney's office in DC, openly threatening and intimidating political opponents, dismissing charges against his own clients, firing public servants for their roles in legitimate investigations and using his office as a cudgel to chill dissent and free speech,\" Schiff said in a statement to CBS News.",
      "Former staff in the U.S. Attorney's Office in D.C. have criticized Martin for dismissing prosecutors who handled cases involving U.S. Capitol insurrectionists. Martin has praised Elon Musk and Mr. Trump on his social media account in the two months since taking over as top prosecutor.",
      "Martin posted in a\u00a0letter on X\u00a0that he would go after those who have threatened Musk and Department of Government Efficiency employees, pursuing them \"to the end of the earth to hold them accountable.\"",
      "He has been posting on social media about crime in Washington, D.C., using the hashtag #MarchBadness.\u00a0 In one post last month, Martin wrote, \"Hey, thugs with guns, you hear that? Yup, we comin.'\"",
      "In another social media post earlier this year, Martin wrote that his predecessor was a \"Biden prosecutor\" who \"upped political prosecutions, he steered resources to a now-debunked legal theory that targeted American citizens, and gun prosecutions went down. Literally. Let me be clear: he used our $ to chase political hoaxes while the people of DC were terrorized by thugs with guns.\"",
      "Schiff said, \"No one embodies Donald Trump's personal weaponization of the Justice Department more than Ed Martin. He is unfit to serve as a lawyer, let alone one with the resources \u2013 and cover from the Senate \u2013 to further twist the power of the law.\"",
      "A spokesperson for Martin declined to comment.",
      "Before he was appointed acting U.S. attorney in D.C., Martin was a politician in Missouri and served on the Republican National Committee platform committee in 2024.",

      "Syphilis cases skyrocketed in the U.S. as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's STD prevention budget dropped, data shows. In 2003, the budget was around $169 million and there were about 34,000 cases in the U.S. In 2023, the budget was roughly $80 million and there were about 209,000 cases nationwide.",

      "Rates of congenital syphilis, when babies get the infection from their mothers during pregnancy, have increased 10-fold nationally in the last decade, according to CDC data, and the rate for Indigenous babies is 8-times higher than those born to White mothers. Congenital syphilis may cause stillbirth, miscarriages, vision or hearing loss, intellectual disability and more.",
      "Most of these cases could be prevented with early testing and treatment during pregnancy.",

      "\"These are folks who have no home. They're folks who have no income. They're just surviving day to day,\" said Dr. Jon Iralu, who started his career with the Indian Health Service at the height of the AIDS epidemic and has been fighting infectious diseases in the area ever since.",
      "\"It's all about testing and immediate treatment,\" Iralu said. \"You have a person right there \u2014 you might not see them again.\"",

      "\"If we had done this 10 years ago, before the COVID pandemic, people would have been afraid. People are used to these sort of public health interventions and a little more open,\" he said. \"I think in some ways, the pandemic was part of the problem, but it's also part of the solution.\"",
      "Those leading the fight are convinced the program, focused on bringing treatments where and when they're needed most, can be replicated to help patients across the U.S.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trumps-big-law-firms-retribution/",
    "published": "Tue, 01 Apr 2025 17:35:38 -0400",
    "summary": "President Trump has signed a string of executive orders in recent weeks targeting some of the nation's most prominent law firms.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump's string of executive orders in recent weeks that target major law firms mark the latest front in his effort to settle long-held scores with political opponents. But the broadside has been met with alarm about the damage the punishments could do to the viability of the firms and, crucially, the threat they pose to the rule of law.",
      "The executive orders signed by Mr. Trump have so far targeted four law firms: Perkins Coie, Paul Weiss, Wilmer Cutler Pickering Hale and Dorr LLP, and Jenner & Block. But the directive targeting Paul Weiss was rescinded after it and Mr. Trump reached an agreement under which the firm agreed to provide $40 million in pro bono legal services for causes that the administration supports, among other assurances.",
      "A fifth firm, Covington & Burling, was the subject of a directive that targeted the security clearance of a lawyer who assisted former special counsel Jack Smith, who oversaw the two prosecutions of Mr. Trump that were dropped, one in July 2024, and the other after he was elected to a second term. And a sixth, Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP, entered into a preemptive deal with the president to provide more than $100 million in free legal work, along with other commitments. The president announced Tuesday an agreement with Willkie Farr & Gallagher LLP, where former second gentleman Doug Emhoff is a partner, in which the firm would offer at least $100 million in pro bono services. The firm also represented former\u00a0Georgia election workers Ruby Freeman and Shaye Moss in their lawsuit against Trump ally Rudy Giuliani.",
      "The executive orders are among the more than 100 that Mr. Trump has issued since returning to the White House for a second term, and they come amid a broader campaign of retribution against his critics that includes revoking security clearances and protective details.",
      "But legal scholars warn that the restrictions aimed at the law firms strike at the rule of law and the nation's adversarial system of justice.",
      "\"These orders do more than just take revenge against particular lawyers who have crossed Donald Trump,\" said Walter Olson, a senior fellow at the Cato Institute. \"They are meant to send the message that it is dangerous to oppose him in court, that you are apt to suffer not just yourself, but also law firms that you're associated with will suffer sweeping penalties that can threaten their very ability to go on existing.\"",
      "The orders rolled out by Mr. Trump in the past few weeks target the firms for their legal work, as well as the lawyers who were on their payrolls \u2014 even if they're not anymore.",
      "In the case of Perkins Coie, the president's directive attacks the firm for representing Hillary Clinton during her 2016 presidential campaign and hiring a research firm that retained former British spy Christopher Steele, who produced the infamous \"Steele Dossier.\"",
      "For WilmerHale and Jenner & Block, the orders seek to punish the firms because they hired lawyers who worked on the Justice Department's investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election during Mr. Trump's first term. At WilmerHale, that includes Robert Mueller, the former special counsel who led that probe, and two lawyers who worked on his team, Aaron Zebley and James Quarles. Mueller and Quarles no longer work at WilmerHale. At Jenner & Block, the president attacked the firm for employing Andrew Weissmann, who also worked on Mueller's probe. He left Jenner & Block in 2021.",
      "Jenner & Block, WilmerHale and Perkins Coie are also involved in legal challenges to Mr. Trump's second-term policies, including his effort to withhold federal funds from medical institutions that provide gender-affirming care to young people under the age of 19, his firing of eight inspectors general and directive to prohibit transgender people from serving in the military.",
      "\"These firms are at the vanguard of fighting the Trump administration on a whole host of issues,\" said David Lat, a lawyer-turned-writer who authors a newsletter on legal affairs. \"So, if Donald Trump can force or frighten law firms into not taking cases against his administration, that will allow the administration to become more powerful.\"",
      "Lat likened the executive orders to a boxing match where one fighter is trying to chop the arms off of their opponent.",
      "\"In America, our legal system rests on the idea that you are entitled to a lawyer, and these executive orders are deterring law firms and lawyers from taking certain cases,\" he said. \"The other issue is they are a threat to the rule of law, and they are a threat to the adversarial system that powers our justice system.\"",
      "Mr. Trump justified the orders as furthering his administration's commitment to addressing the \"significant risks\" associated with \"Big Law firms,\" which he claims \"engage in conduct detrimental to critical American interests.\"",
      "The president's orders specifically require any government contractors to disclose any business they have with the firms and also direct agency heads to cancel any contracts with the targets of the orders. Agencies also must reassess contracts with the firms or companies that do business with them to ensure funding decisions align \"with the interests of the citizens of the United States\" and administration priorities.",
      "Finally, Mr. Trump's executive actions calls on his administration to restrict access to federal buildings for employees of Perkins Coie, WilmerHale and Jenner & Block.",
      "The three firms have all filed federal lawsuits challenging the orders as violations of the First, Fifth and Sixth Amendments.",
      "\"This lawsuit is absolutely critical to vindicating the First Amendment, our adversarial system of justice, and the rule of law,\" Paul Clement, who served as solicitor general under President George W. Bush and has argued more than 100 cases before the Supreme Court, said in a statement. Clement is representing WilmerHale in its challenge to Mr. Trump's executive order.",
      "Three different judges assigned to each of the cases \u2014 appointed by two different presidents \u2014 have agreed to temporarily block portions of the orders while proceedings move forward. While the cases may end with a decision from the Supreme Court months from now that invalidates the directives as unconstitutional, the fallout has been swift.",
      "Thomas Perrelli, firm chair and a partner at Jenner & Block, said in a declaration last week that one client was notified by the Justice Department that they could not bring their lawyers from the firm to a department meeting set for April 3. That client, Perrelli wrote, would've had to attend the meeting without their outside representation or hire new counsel. A federal district court blocked enforcement of the portion of Mr. Trump's order restricting Jenner & Block employees' access to federal buildings and the requirements for government contractors.",
      "He also wrote that 40% of the firm's revenue last year came from clients who are government contractors or subcontractors, and warned that if the firm lost that business, \"it would be a serious threat to the firm's financial health.\"",
      "Bruce Berman, general counsel at WilmerHale, wrote in his own declaration that at least 21 of the firm's 25 largest clients in 2024 \u2014 which accounted for 30% of its revenue, or nearly $500 million \u2014 have federal contracts. He noted that WilmerHale attorneys are set to meet with Justice Department lawyers over videoconference this week, but said at the time of his filing that it was uncertain whether they would refuse to meet with them.",
      "At Perkins Coie, David Burman, a partner at the firm, told a federal court in a filing that several clients terminated or said they were considering ending their legal engagements because of the restrictions imposed by Mr. Trump's order. Burman said that a major government contractor that had been a client for more than 35 years withdrew its work from Perkins Coie in light of the order, and four other clients rescinded its work from the firm early last month because they needed to engage with federal agencies.",
      "\"The orders don't have to go into effect for them to strike fear in the hearts of lawyers across the country,\" Lat said, adding that while law firms are wealthy, they can also be fragile.",
      "For many so-called \"Big Law\" firms, their work involves serving not only individuals, but also large corporations that seek help with patent or trademark applications, mergers and acquisitions or energy transactions \u2014 areas that land before a federal regulatory agency.",
      "But a swift departure of those clients means firms are at risk of losing sizable chunks of business at once, which could also force their lawyers to leave if their practice area involves significant government involvement.",
      "\"These firms can face a run of clients against them the same way the banks can face a run of depositors trying to take out their money at once,\" Olson said. \"This can quickly turn into a downward spiral.\"",
      "The potential damage to their business \u2014 and the ripple effect that would have on employees \u2014 may be why some law firms have remained on the sidelines and chosen not to speak out against Mr. Trump's sanctions. Olson acknowledged there are many reasons why other firms may want to stay out of the president's sight line for fear of retaliation.",
      "But he said that an \"age-old part of being a free republic\" is protecting the independence of the court and the legal profession so they don't become instruments of the person in power.",
      "\"Sometimes the times call for courage,\" Olson said. \"Are you recognizing that this is one of those times that the ordinary calculations aren't good enough, the calculations that would do against many ordinary sorts of danger? This is an extraordinary danger. Maybe it calls for extraordinary courage.\"",

      "Vallow had gone to the home where Vallow Daybell was living with Cox and the two children after their separation to pick up JJ. The home was in Chandler, a suburb of Phoenix, Arizona.",
      "In police video, Tylee said that she heard Vallow and Cox arguing.",
      "\"Honestly, it feels, it feels like 2 seconds, and 40 minutes at the same time. ... I just kind of heard yelling over everything. I don't know, I kind of just do that when everything is, like, really loud, I kind of just tune what people are saying out,\" she told detectives.",
      "Cox told police that he had killed Vallow in self-defense. He was not arrested.",
      "Cox's wife, Zulema Pastenes, testified that Daybell and Vallow Daybell had convinced him that his divine mission was to protect his sister. Pastenes said that Cox told her he feared the pair would make him their \"fall guy.\" That conversation, Pastenes said, occurred a day before Cox's sudden death in December 2019. Medical examiners said he died of a pulmonary blood clot.",
      "What to know about the latest charges",
      "Lori Vallow Daybell has been charged with conspiring with Alex Cox to kill Charles Vallow. The trial is taking place in Phoenix, Arizona, where Vallow died.",
      "April Raymond\u00a0told \"48 Hours\" that Vallow Daybell, her former friend, told her\u00a0she believed Vallow was already dead and had a demon living inside him. She would later make similar comments about her children.",
      "In December 2024, a judge ruled that Vallow Daybell was mentally fit to stand trial. Cameras will be allowed in the courtroom during the trial, CBS affiliate AZFamily reported. The trial will be livestreamed.",
      "Complicating the trial is Vallow Daybell's decision to represent herself. She said that this will likely complicate jury selection, a comment Judge Justin Beresky agreed with, according to AZFamily. Vallow Daybell said that she has studied case law during her time in prison. She also said she has experience in court that will help her represent herself.",
      "In a hearing on March 18, Vallow appeared to struggle with the responsibility of being her own attorney. She said that her former attorneys would not give her important video evidence, though prosecutors said they can't find the video she referenced, according to AZFamily. Vallow Daybell also said that it has been difficult for her to communicate with her legal team while in prison.",
      "\"Where I am at the jail, the communication is very difficult for me to get ahold of my investigator, get ahold of my paralegal. I'm 23 hours a day locked down. If I don't have Wi-Fi, I don't have a phone, if I don't have battery, I don't have a phone,\" she said.",
      "Opening statements are expected to begin in early April, according to AZFamily. If found guilty, Vallow faces life in prison with the possibility of parole after 25 years. She is already serving multiple life sentences with no possibility of parole after the convictions in Idaho.",
      "This trial is not the last of her legal troubles. Vallow Daybell also faces a charge of conspiracy to commit murder for the attempted shooting of her niece's ex-husband, Brandon Boudreaux. Boudreaux was shot at in 2019 while driving near his home, but was unhurt. Prosecutors say Cox carried out the shooting, but missed his target. Vallow Daybell has pleaded not guilty to the charge.",
      "Lori Vallow Daybell's \"Dateline\" interview",
      "In a jailhouse interview with NBC's \"Dateline,\" which aired in March, Vallow Daybell made multiple baseless claims. She was often combative toward correspondent Keith Morrison as she claimed to be innocent of all charges.",
      "She said she \"was not there\" when JJ and Tylee were killed and was not involved in Tammy Daybell's death. She tried to blame JJ's death on Tylee, Morrison said, but investigators have said Tylee died before JJ.",
      "\"She came in and she had her own agenda,\" Morrison said of Vallow Daybell ahead of the airing of the \"Dateline\" episode. \"She wanted to be the aggressor.\"",
      "During the interview, Vallow Daybell also briefly discussed how she would serve as her own attorney in the Charles Vallow case. She called the process \"great\" but a \"difficult thing to do.\"",

      "Washington \u2014 The House on Tuesday defeated an effort that would have effectively killed a push to allow new parents to vote remotely around the birth of their child, an embarrassing loss for House Speaker Mike Johnson.",
      "Nine Republicans joined all Democrats during a procedural vote to help sink it. Johnson called the outcome \"disappointing,\" adding that a \"handful of Republicans joined with all the Democrats to take down a rule \u2014 that's rarely done.\"",
      "Johnson said it halted further legislative action this week.",
      "\"Let me just make this clear, that rule being brought down means that we can't have any further action on the floor this week,\" Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, told reporters after the vote. \"It's very unfortunate. We'll regroup and come back.\"",
      "The fight over whether to allow remote voting for new moms and dads who serve in Congress came to a head this week with Rep. Anna Paulina Luna, a Florida Republican, leaving the conservative House Freedom Caucus as her colleagues plotted against the bipartisan measure.",
      "The measure, which was introduced by Democratic Rep. Brittany Pettersen of Colorado in January, would allow new parents to designate a colleague to vote for them for 12 weeks after they or their spouse gives birth. The bill would also allow that period to begin earlier if the lawmaker has a serious medical condition or isn't able to travel safely.",
      "But Johnson and other Republicans have opposed proxy voting, arguing that it's unconstitutional. Republicans claimed the measure would create a slippery slope for members to abuse the practice, despite it being narrowly tailored toward new and expectant parents.",
      "Luna, a cosponsor of the bill, moved to bypass leadership and launched a discharge petition that forces a vote on a measure if it secures at least a simple majority. Luna's discharge petition quickly reached the threshold, with 206 Democrats and 11 other Republicans signing on.",
      "Republicans then sought to derail Luna's effort by inserting language into a rule governing debate on an unrelated bill on election security that would table her discharge petition.",
      "In a letter resigning from the House Freedom Caucus on Monday, Luna accused members of threatening Johnson with halting floor proceedings indefinitely unless her effort was blocked. She called the tactic \"a betrayal of trust.\"",
      "\"The speaker is being held hostage,\" Luna told reporters Monday.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-tariffs-april-2-liberation-day/",
    "published": "Tue, 01 Apr 2025 13:40:17 -0400",
    "summary": "Here's what to know about tariffs ahead of President Trump's plans to announce new import duties on April 2.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration is planning to impose a round of fresh tariffs on April 2, a day President Trump has dubbed \"Liberation Day.\" The announcement is viewed by economists as the culmination of his \"America First Trade Policy,\" an\u00a0executive order he signed on his first day in office aimed at revitalizing U.S. manufacturing.",
      "Mr. Trump has referred to his April 2 tariff announcement as \"the big one,\" suggesting that the plans may be more far reaching than the import levies he's already unleashed on goods from other nations, such as his March 26 declaration of 25% tariffs on vehicles and auto parts imported into the\u00a0U.S.",
      "\"For DECADES we have been ripped off and abused by every nation in the World, both friend and foe. Now it is finally time for the Good Ol' USA to get some of that MONEY, and RESPECT, BACK. GOD BLESS AMERICA!!!\" Trump said about his April 2 plans in a post\u00a0earlier this month on Truth Social.",
      "On April 2, Mr. Trump will announce his administration's plans for so-called reciprocal tariffs, at an event in the White House Rose Garden, the White House said. He deems the levies necessary to erase trade imbalances with nations that export more goods to the U.S. than they import from America. But the addition of broad-based tariffs to a host of imports is likely to heat up a global trade war that could, at least in the short term, boost prices for U.S. consumers and juice inflation.",
      "\"Tariffs are a tax on imported goods, and research shows that that majority gets passed along to consumers,\" Colin Grabow, associate director of the Herbert A. Stiefel Center for trade policy studies at the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Ultimately, the Trump administration's goal is to increase prices on imports to the point where it's economically favorable for companies to relocate their manufacturing to the U.S., he noted.",
      "\"If prices don't go up, it doesn't deter imports, and therefore there is no reason to set up shop in the U.S.,\" Grabow explained. \"Part of the logic is premised on prices going up, otherwise they are not going to accomplish their goal.\"",
      "Economists say that Mr. Trump's tariff agenda, including the uncertainty surrounding it, could drag down U.S. GDP by depressing financial markets and consumer sentiment.",
      "\"The main channel from trade policy uncertainty to GDP is via business investment. Under higher trade policy uncertainty, future revenue streams of an investment become more uncertain, raising the option value of delaying investment decisions until the situation is clearer,\" Oxford Economics analysts said in a research note.",
      "What tariffs will Trump announce April 2?",
      "Mr. Trump teased his April 2 announcement last week when he announced his new 25% tariffs on foreign-made cars and auto parts. \"That's Liberation Day, that's gonna be on the 2nd, and that's gonna be reciprocal, and I think people will be impressed,\" the president said.",
      "Reciprocal tariffs are designed to match the import duties placed on U.S. goods and services by other nations, as well as compensate for other trade barriers, according to the Yale Budget Lab, a non-partisan public policy think tank. According to a White House memo from Feb. 13, the U.S. faces additional trade barriers aside from tariffs such as regulatory requirements that can make it more difficult for American exports to reach other nations.",
      "While the size and scope of the reciprocal tariffs that Mr. Trump plans to announce are still unknown, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent previously said the administration's reciprocal tariffs would target countries with the biggest trade surpluses, as well as those which have imposed the highest tariffs plus non-tariff trade barriers on U.S. goods.",
      "Multiple nations run large annual trade surpluses with the U.S., including Germany, Ireland and Italy in the European Union, as well as Vietnam, Japan and Taiwan. The U.S. also has a large trade deficit with China, although Mr. Trump has already imposed new tariffs on that nation.",
      "\"It'll be in many cases less than the tariff that they've been charging us for decades ... I think we're trying to keep it somewhat conservative,\" Mr. Trump said on March 26.",
      "Mr. Trump added that he'll introduce a reciprocal tariff policy on \"all countries,\" which he said would be \"very lenient.\"",
      "On Sunday, National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett told Fox News' Maria Bartiromo that there are 15 countries \"that we have massive, massive trade deficits with,\" but that Mr. Trump will ultimately decided how many countries will be subject to new tariffs Wednesday.",
      "Mr. Hassett also promoted tariffs as an effective tool for reshoring manufacturing to the U.S., saying \"it's going to be a boom,\" referring to auto manufacturing in particular.",
      "Meanwhile, additional tariffs are also slated to go into effect on April 2, with Mr. Trump's one-month delay on 25% tariffs on Canadian and Mexican imports set to expire that day. The 25% auto tariff announced by the president on March 26 is also scheduled to take effect on April 2.",
      "What are reciprocal tariffs?",
      "Reciprocal tariffs enacted by the U.S. would match foreign nations' levies and other trade policies on American goods.",
      "A reciprocal tariff policy would include calculating a country-specific number that the Trump administration deems representative of all trade barriers. But import restrictions other than tariffs, such as regulatory requirements, could be hard to quantify, economists say.",
      "\"There are a lot of intangibles, like testing regulations for different products in countries, or perceived openness to business with American companies,\" Simon Macadam, deputy chief global economist at Capital Economics, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"These are things you can't easily put a number on.\"",
      "Because of this complexity, some experts expect Trump's reciprocal tariffs could be more limited in scope, and might not be truly \"reciprocal\" because they may not exactly match other countries' levies.",
      "\"We shouldn't be surprised if some of the stuff is rolled back, or not as sweeping as maybe originally talked about, because logistically, from a practical perspective, running the calculations and coming up with a number is extremely time consuming,\" Grabow of the Cato Institute said.",
      "Wilbur Ross, who served as the U.S. Secretary of Commerce during the first Trump administration, agreed that a truly reciprocal tariff policy would be \"very complicated to get to work.\"",
      "\"If you were literally going to be reciprocal, you would put the same tariff on a product that comes into the U.S. as that country charges on products from the U.S.,\" he said. \"But the problem is you'd be charging a different tariff on the same item from different countries.\"",
      "That would create loopholes for exporters to ship products through lower-tariffed countries to the U.S., Ross added. \"It would make it easy for people to game the system,\" he said.",
      "What does Trump want to achieve?",
      "Through his \"Fair and Reciprocal Plan\" on trade, Mr. Trump is aiming to bring about three outcomes: Boost U.S. manufacturing jobs; close the $1.2 trillion U.S. trade deficit; and gain leverage over U.S. trade partners.",
      "But experts say that trade barriers such as tariffs may not be enough to revitalize U.S. manufacturing jobs, which have fallen sharply over the last few decades. Fewer than 13 million people are employed in manufacturing today, down from a peak of 19.6 million in 1979,\u00a0according to federal data.",
      "\"To a large extent, and particularly in low- and medium-tech industries, the economics of production will not be significantly altered by a 10-20% tariff,\" Macadam said. \"When labor costs in hubs like Mexico are one-fifth of what they are in the U.S., in order to induce companies to seriously relocate a lot of production back to the U.S. a 20% tariff isn't going to cut it.\"",
      "There's also the unknown of how long any new tariffs announced by Mr. Trump will remain in place. Such uncertainty could deter American or foreign businesses from investing heavily in re-shoring manufacturing to the U.S.",
      "\"Even if for some companies it gets to the point where it seems to make financial sense to move back to the U.S., there's the question of, 'Are these tariffs actually going to last a long time?'\" Macadam said. \"If you think the tariff is going to be there forever, then yeah, absolutely relocate. But if it's reversed or rates are lowered, then it would have been silly to relocate.\"",
      "What will tariffs mean for consumers?",
      "Consumers typically pay the price for tariffs, as companies have said they plan on passing off much of the costs to their customers.",
      "As a result, a round of fresh tariffs could boost inflation, economists say. According to an analysis by Oxford Economics, if the effective tariff rate on imports into the U.S. rises from their 2024 level of 2.5% to 10% in April, which is what Oxford Economics expects, prices in aggregate would rise by half a percentage point.",
      "\"Inflation was on trend to fall \u2014 now we expect it to rise,\" Michael Pearce, senior U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, told CBS MoneyWatch.",

      "Hegseth, in Tokyo on Sunday, called Japan an \"indispensable partner\" in deterring Chinese assertiveness and announced an upgrade of the U.S. military command in Japan to a new \"war-fighting headquarters.\" He stressed the need for the U.S. and Japan to do more to strengthen their military capability as the region faces China's rising assertiveness in its myriad territorial disputes in the region.",
      "\"Japan is our indispensable partner in deterring Communist Chinese military aggression,\" Hegseth said at the beginning of his talks with Japan's Defense Minister Gen Nakatani in Tokyo. \"The U.S. is moving fast, as you know, to reestablish deterrence in this region and around the world.\"",
      "Hegseth's visit came amid concern in Japan about how U.S. engagement in the region could change under President Trump's \"America First\" policy, Japanese defense officials said, speaking on condition of anonymity, citing protocol. Mr. Trump has threatened to impose trade tariffs on Japan, a key U.S. ally, sparking more concern.",
      "The two sides agreed to accelerate plans to jointly develop and produce missiles such as Advanced Medium-Range Air to Air Missiles, or MRAAM, and consider producing SM-6 surface-to-air missiles, to help ease a shortage of munitions, Nakatani said.

      "\"Lai Ching-te stubbornly insists on a 'Taiwan independence' stance, brazenly labeling the mainland as a 'foreign hostile force,' and has put forward a so-called \"17-point strategy ... stirring up anti-China sentiments,\" said China's Taiwan Affairs Office in a statement on Tuesday. \"We will not tolerate or condone this in any way and must resolutely counter and severely punish these actions.\"",
      "In mid-March, Taiwan's Lai put forward a 17-point strategy aimed at shoring up Taiwan's national security. The points include allowing espionage cases to be tried by military courts and making immigration rules stricter for Chinese citizens applying for permanent residency.",

The fourth missing soldier's body was recovered Tuesday, a day after the three other soldiers were found, the Army's Europe and Africa Command said in a statement.",
      "All of the soldiers were assigned to the 1st Armored Brigade Combat Team, 3rd Infantry Division and were permanently stationed at Fort Stewart in Georgia.",

      "\"I can't say enough about the support our Lithuanian Allies have provided us,\" Gen. Christopher Donahue, commander of U.S. Army Europe and Africa, said in Tuesday's statement. \"We have leaned on them, and they, alongside our Polish and Estonian Allies \u2014 and our own Sailors, Airmen and experts from the Corps of Engineers \u2014 have enabled us to find and bring home our Soldiers. This is a tragic event, but it reinforces what it means to have Allies and friends.\"",

      "OIJ Director R\u00e1ndall Z\u00fa\u00f1iga said Monday that a team testing the family's hotel room found high levels of carbon monoxide, and that the room where they stayed was situated next to \"a specialized machine room\" that could have caused the contamination.

We trust that the forensic process will objectively, clearly, and conclusively clarify the causes of this unfortunate incident.\"",

      "Le Pen, speaking to French TV channel TF1 in her first reaction to the verdict, said she would appeal and called the ruling a \"political\" move aimed at preventing her from running in the 2027 presidential election.",
      "She said the court should not have made her ineligible to run for office until all her chances at appeal had been exhausted.",
      "\"If that's not a political decision, I don't know what is,\" she said.",
      "Le Pen would remain ineligible to be a candidate until the appeal is decided, but the house arrest and fine would be suspended during the appeals process.",
      "Le Pen said she would ask that the court proceedings take place before the 2027 campaign. Only an appellate ruling that overturns the ban on public office could restore her hopes of running. But, there's no guarantee that an appeals court would rule more favorably, and appeals in France can take several years to conclude.",
      "Rodolphe Bosselut, Le Pen's lawyer, said he was \"appalled\" by the court's decision, calling it \"extremely scandalous.\" He also vowed to launch an appeal against the guilty verdict.",
      "Recent polling has shown Le Pen likely would have won at least a first round in France's next national election, though it is much less clear how she would have fared in a second round against a more moderate candidate.",
      "Far-right political figures across Europe \u2014 including the Netherlands' Geert Wilders and Italy's Matteo Salvini\u00a0\u2014 condemned the verdict Monday.",
      "In Russia, meanwhile, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov claimed Le Pen's sentencing was evidence of European nations \"going down the path of trampling over democratic norms.\"",
      "\"Of course, we do not want to interfere in France's internal affairs, we have never done so, and this is France's internal affair,\" said Peskov, \"but in general, our observations of European capitals show that they are not at all reluctant to go beyond democracy during the political process.\"",
      "Le Pen, 56, garnered 41% of the ballots in the last French presidential election in 2022 \u2014 beaten decisively by current President Emmanuel Macron \u2014 and she has made no secret of her desire to run again for the nation's highest office.",
      "Sat in the front row of the Paris court, Le Pen whispered \"incredible\" as the judge detailed his reasoning for the guilty verdict. She walked out of the court before the sentences were announced.",
      "Le Pen, along with eight current or former party members, had faced up to 10 years in prison on the embezzlement charges. A dozen others who served as parliamentary aides for the National Rally party, formerly the National Front, also received guilty verdicts for their role in the scheme.",
      "The judge said Le Pen and her colleagues did not enrich themselves personally but called the embezzlement \"a democratic bypass\" that duped the French parliament and voters. He said Le Pen was at the center of \"a system\" used to siphon off EU money intended to pay EU parliamentary aides, to instead pay party staff between 2004 and 2016.",
      "Le Pen has denied any wrongdoing, claiming prosecutors were \"only interested\" in barring her from the presidential election. She told La Tribune Dimanche\u00a0newspaper on Sunday, before the verdict was handed down, that the judges had \"the right of life or death over our movement.\"",
      "Le Pen may have no choice now but to cede her party's presidential ambitions to its current president, Jordan Bardella, a 29-year-old who took over as National Rally leader in 2021.",
      "Editor's note: An earlier version of this story mischaracterized the appeals process. Le Pen says she will appeal.",

    "summary": "As Iran's nuclear program advances, the country's foreign minister says Tehran won't negotiate under President Trump's \"maximum pressure.\"",
    "story": [
      "President Trump has said he sent a letter to Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei expressing his desire to negotiate over the country's advancing nuclear program. He made the announcement in an interview with Fox News Channel's \"Sunday Morning Futures,\" which\u00a0was recorded this week. In the interview, Mr. Trump said he sent the letter \"yesterday,\" but the exact timing remained unclear.",
      "\"I would rather negotiate a deal. I'm not sure that everybody agrees with me, but we can make a deal that would be just as good as if you won militarily,\" Mr. Trump said in a clip from the interview, which was shared by the network ahead of its full airing this weekend, Fox said.",
      "\"But the time is happening now. The time is coming up,\" Mr. Trump said. \"Something's going to happen one way or the other. I hope that Iran \u2014 and I've written him a letter, saying, 'I hope you're going to negotiate.' Because if we have to go in militarily, it's going to be a terrible thing \u2014 for them.\"",
      "In the interview, Mr. Trump said he believed Iran wanted \"to get that letter,\" adding that \"the other alternative is, we have to do something. Because you can't let them have a nuclear weapon.\"",
      "Iranian media reported that on Wednesday a letter from Mr. Trump was delivered to Tehran by a senior United Arab Emirates diplomat, the French news agency AFP said.",
      "Late last week Iran's state-run media said that no letter had been received from Mr. Trump, and Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi told the French news agency AFP on Friday that Iran would not negotiate with the U.S. while heavy U.S. sanctions against the country remain in place.",
      "A\u00a0report last month\u00a0by the United Nations nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency, said Iran had \"significantly increased production and accumulation of high enriched uranium,\" marking a progression in the country's nuclear program since Mr. Trump was reelected.",
      "In 2018, during Mr. Trump's first term, he unilaterally withdrew the United States from a negotiated deal with Iran and other world powers that was aimed at curbing the country's nuclear program. Mr. Trump imposed a wide range of new sanctions on Iran at the time, calling it a policy of \"maximum pressure\" to force Tehran to broker a new deal. That policy has decimated Iran's economy, but there have been no new negotiations between the two sides acknowledged publicly since.",
      "Under the original nuclear deal, Iran was permitted to enrich uranium up to 3.67% purity and maintain a stockpile of no more than 661 pounds at that level. At that purity, uranium can be used for medical, research and other civilian purposes, but not to build a nuclear weapon.",
      "The most recent IAEA report found Iran was enriching more uranium to 60% purity \u2014 much closer to the level required for weapons, which is about 90%, and a level at which it was only confirmed to have started enriching after Mr. Trump pulled the U.S. out of the nuclear agreement. Its stockpile of that highly enriched uranium had risen as of February to about 606 pounds, according to the IAEA report.",
      "Iran has long insisted its nuclear program is for entirely peaceful purposes, as tension has continued to rise with the U.S. over its sanctions, and with Israel over its war against the Iranian-backed, U.S.-designated terrorist group Hamas.",
      "Last August, Khamenei said there was \"no harm\" in engagement with the U.S., but more recently he said negotiations would not be \"intelligent, wise or honorable.\"",

      "Iran has long maintained its program is for peaceful purposes, even as its officials increasingly threaten to pursue the bomb as tensions are high with the U.S. over its sanctions and after the collapse of a ceasefire in Israel's\u00a0war against Hamas in the Gaza Strip.",
      "As the U.S. conducts intense airstrikes targeting the Iranian-backed Houthi rebels of Yemen, the risk of military action targeting Iran's nuclear program remains on the table.",
      "A\u00a0report last month\u00a0by the United Nations nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency, said Iran had \"significantly increased production and accumulation of high enriched uranium.\"",
      "Last week, Khamenei warned that U.S. threats against his country \"will get them nowhere,\" adding that Americans \"and others should know that if they do anything malign to the Iranian nation, they will get a hard slap.\"",
      "He had previously\u00a0dismissed Mr. Trump's overtures\u00a0for talks, accusing the U.S. president of attempting to deceive global public opinion by portraying the United States as willing to negotiate and Iran as unwilling to engage.",
      "Mr. Trump's first term in office was marked by a particularly troubled period in relations with Tehran. In 2018, he unilaterally withdrew the United States from Iran's nuclear deal with world powers, leading to sanctions hobbling Iran's economy. Iran retaliated with attacks at sea \u2014 including one that it likely carried out and that temporarily halved Saudi Arabia's oil production.",

    "story": [
      "The chairperson of an African charity co-founded by Prince Harry accused the royal on Sunday of orchestrating a bullying and harassment campaign to try to force her out, as she pushed back following his abrupt resignation from the organization.",
      "Sophie Chandauka, the chair of Sentebale, a charity Harry co-founded in 2006 that was long aimed at helping children in southern Africa who have HIV/AIDS, took several shots at Harry on Sky News. Chandauka said the prince's Netflix deal interfered with a scheduled fundraiser and that an incident with his wife, Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, became a source of friction.",
      "The Duke of Sussex resigned Tuesday as a patron of Sentebale, which he helped establish in honor of his late mother, Princess Diana, citing a breakdown in the relationships between board members and Chandauka.",
      "Harry and co-founder, Prince Seeiso of Lesotho, said in a joint statement that they quit \"with heavy hearts\" as patrons in solidarity with five trustees who resigned over an internal dispute with Chandauka, who refused to step down when asked. The stalemate reportedly involved a change in the organization's mission.",
      "\"It is devastating that the relationship between the charity's trustees and the chair of the board broke down beyond repair, creating an untenable situation,\" the princes said in their statement. \"What's transpired is unthinkable. We are in shock that we have to do this, but we have a continued responsibility to Sentebale's beneficiaries, so we will be sharing all of our concerns with the Charity Commission as to how this came about.\"",
      "Chandauka sued the charity in order to remain in her position, according to the statement. She said that she reported Sentebale's trustees to the Charity Commission in the U.K. and filed papers in a British court to prevent her removal.",
      "She alleged there was misconduct at the charity without naming anyone or offering any details in a statement Tuesday. It said she had tried to blow the whistle on \"abuse of power, bullying, harassment, misogyny and misogynoir,\" the latter word referring to a combination of racism and misogyny directed toward Black women.",
      "Chandauka told Sky that Harry's resignation had caught her blindsided and was \"an example of harassment and bullying at scale.\" She said he also had interfered with her whistleblower complaint.",
      "\"So it's a cover-up, and the prince is involved,\" she said.",
      "A source familiar with the events rejected that claim, telling CBS News that both Harry and Seeiso had sent a joint resignation letter to the chair as well as trustees on March 10. A source close to trustees and patrons of the charity told CBS News that Chandauka's \"publicity stunt\" had been expected, and that the princes' collective decision to step down was taken with it in mind.",
      "Chandauka said there was a significant drop in donors to Sentebale after Harry and Meghan left their official royal duties in January 2020 and eventually settled in California.",
      "The charity, whose name means \"don't forget me\" in the Sesotho language of Lesotho and South Africa, was founded to help youths affected by AIDS in the small mountainous nation and in Botswana. But it is now moving to address youth health, wealth and climate resilience across southern Africa.",
      "The biggest risk to the charity was the \"toxicity of its lead patron's brand,\" Chandauka argued in an interview with the Financial Times.",
      "In the Sky interview, she said a polo fundraiser scheduled in Miami last year almost fell apart when Harry asked to bring a camera crew along to film for a Netflix series he was shooting.",
      "The cost of the venue skyrocketed when it became a commercial venture and they scrambled to find another host, which Harry arranged through his connections, she said. Meghan's surprise appearance at the event led to an awkward moment during the trophy presentation after the match, Chandauka said.",
      "In a video clip circulated on social media, Chandauka tried to pose next to the duke as he held the trophy in one hand and had his other wrapped around Meghan. But the duchess appeared to gesture that Chandauka move farther from Harry, forcing her to duck under the silver cup to get into the photo.",
      "\"The international press captured this, and there was a lot of talk about the duchess and the choreography on stage and whether she should have been there and her treatment of me,\" Chandauka said.",

      "The movie also received nominations for best cinematography, best original score and best makeup at the 77th Academy Awards in 2005.",
      "The film sparked widespread controversy upon its release due to its graphic depiction of Jesus' suffering and crucifixion. Critics also raised questions about the movie's biblical and historical accuracy. In addition, \"The Passion of the Christ\" was accused of being antisemitic due to its portrayals of Jewish leaders and their roles in Jesus' death.",
      "However, the public interest that was generated by the controversies surrounding the movie has also been credited with contributing to its success, and PR expert Steve Honig told Fox News Digital that history may repeat itself with the sequel.",

      "\"Moviegoers will be curious about the film and that may be enough to get them to see the movie, or at least read the reviews and let that guide them,\" Honig said. \"At the end of the day, and ironically, it may be controversy over the film that drives people into the theater.\"",
      "Despite achieving massive success as both an actor and director, Gibson himself has been embroiled in a number of controversies over the years due to legal troubles and inflammatory statements he made both publicly and in leaked conversations.",
      "Two years after \"The Passion of the Christ\" was released, Gibson notoriously unleashed an antisemitic tirade on a Jewish law enforcement officer when he was arrested for driving under the influence in July 2006.",
      "He later apologized to the Jewish community for his \"vitriolic and harmful words\" that he said were \"blurted out in a moment of insanity.\" The \"Conspiracy Theory\" star subsequently entered rehab.",
      "In 2010, Gibson faced backlash again over leaked voicemails in which he could be heard using racist and misogynistic language directed at then-girlfriend Oksana Grigorieva. Gibson entered a \"no contest\" plea to a misdemeanor charge of domestic battery against her the following year.",

      "Gibson previously received the best director and best picture award for 1995's \"Braveheart,\" in which he also starred. The historical drama received 10 total nominations.",
      "Honig told Fox News Digital that the success of \"The Resurrection of the Christ\" may hinge on whether Gibson has rehabilitated his image in the eyes of the public.",
      "\"The question here is, has Mel Gibson gotten through all the controversy that has surrounded him for so long? In some ways, time does heal all wounds, however, in other ways, it\u2019s hard for many people to forgive and forget,\" he said.",
      "Honig continued, \"We\u2019re living in a very fragmented society right now so there will likely be a strong segment of the population who embrace the film and others who will push it aside.\"",
      "Gibson, who was recently named a special ambassador to Hollywood by President Trump, first confirmed that he was working on a sequel to \"The Passion of the Christ\" in 2016.",

      "\"And you know, it's not the 'Passion 2.' It's called 'The Resurrection,'\" Gibson told evangelist Greg Laurie at SoCal Harvest, via\u00a0IndieWire.",
      "While \"The Passion of the Christ\" followed the last 12 hours of Jesus' life leading up to the crucifixion, Gibson said the sequel will focus on his\u00a0resurrection.",
      "\"Of course, that's a very big subject and it needs to be looked at because we don't want to just do a simple rendering of it \u2013 you know, read what happened,\" the actor added.",

      "Over the years, Gibson and Caviezel dropped hints about what fans can expect from \"The Resurrection of the Christ.\"",

      "In a 2020 FOX Nation interview, Caviezel told Fox News contributor Raymond Arroyo that he had seen the \"fifth draft\" of the movie's screenplay.",

      "During a January appearance on \"The Joe Rogan Experience,\" Gibson reflected on the challenges that he faced while making \"The Passion,\" which he self-financed through his company Icon Productions.",
      "\"There was a lot of opposition to it,\" Gibson recalled. \"I think if you ever hit on this subject matter, you're going to get people going.\"",
      "He continued, \"It's a big subject matter, and my contention was, when I was making it, it was like, you're making this film. And the idea was that we're all responsible for this, that his sacrifice was for all mankind, and for all our ills and all the things in our fallen nature. It was a redemption.\"",
      "Gibson also shared details about \"The Resurrection\" and the themes that the movie will explore.",
      "LIKE WHAT YOU\u2019RE READING? CLICK HERE FOR MORE ENTERTAINMENT NEWS",
      "\"I'm going to try and tackle this question,\" he said. \"That there are big realms, spiritual realms. There's good, there's evil, and they are slugging it out for the souls of mankind. And my question is, \u2018Why are we even important, little old, flawed humanity? Why are we important in that process where the big realms are slugging it out over us?\u2019\"",
      "\"And I think there's bigger things at play here,\" Gibson continued. \"And institutions that purport to touch on the divine are necessarily going to be affected by that slugfest that's going on between good and evil.\"",
      "\"The Resurrection\" will be set over the three days after the crucifixion. (Mary Evans/Ronald Grant/Everett Collection)",
      "Gibson explained that he wrote the script with his brother Donal Gibson and Wallace over the last seven years.",
      "\"There\u2019s a lot required because it\u2019s an acid trip. I\u2019ve never read anything like it,\" he told Rogan. \"My brother and I and Randall all sort of congregated on this. So there\u2019s some good heads put together, but there\u2019s some crazy stuff.\"",
      "\"And I think in order to really tell the story properly you have to really start with the fall of the angels, which means you\u2019re in another place, you\u2019re in another realm,\" he continued. \"You need to go to hell. You need to go to Sheol.\"",
      "CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR THE ENTERTAINMENT NEWSLETTER",
      "\"You got to have his origin,\" Gibson added. \"I have ideas about how to do that and how to evoke things about to depict that. I\u2019ve been thinking about that for a long time. It\u2019s going to require a lot of planning. I\u2019m not sure I can pull it off. It\u2019s super ambitious, but I\u2019m going to take a crack at it.\"",
      "\"It\u2019s about trying to find a way in that\u2019s not cheesy or obvious. It\u2019s almost like a magic trick,\" he said. \"It took a long time to write. It's very ambitious. It goes from the fall of the angels to the death of the last apostle.\"",
      "Gibson confirmed that he plans for Caviezel to reprise his role as Jesus. However, he noted that de-aging and CGI techniques will be needed because the movie is set over the three days after the events of \"The Passion\" but more than 20 years have passed since the first film.",
      "The director explained that the movie's dialogue will likely be in English, unlike \"The Passion,\" which was entirely in Aramaic, Hebrew and Latin with subtitles.",
      "\"I don't know that you can do it in a foreign language because the concepts are too difficult now,\" Gibson said.",
      "Gibson said the film's dialogue will likely be in English, unlike the first movie. (Mike Marsland/Mike Marsland/WireImage via Getty Images)",
      "Doug Eldridge of Achilles PR, shared his thoughts on the likelihood of the success of \"The Resurrection,\" telling Fox News Digital that Gibson's interview with Rogan was \"really insightful.\"",
      "\"He described the opposition to the concept behind \u2018The Passion,\u2019 as well as Hollywood's reluctance to embrace it, even after it was a runaway hit,\" Eldrige said. \"The first time around, he took the most incredible story \u2013 but also, the most difficult to portray \u2013 and he did it in a brutally beautiful way.\"",
      "He continued, \"To follow up on something like that would be like following an A+ on a test in grade school; there's no way you can surpass it, the best you can possibly do is equal it, and even then, that's a heavy lift and a tall order.\"",
      "\"For comparison, \u2018Gladiator\u2019 was one of the most acclaimed films of all time: incredible acting, beautiful score, amazing story, and a perfect ending. What did they do? They made a sequel 24 years later and it bombed. That's not to say Gibson's sequel will suffer the same fate, but it's hard to follow a 'best in class' production with a sequel that meets audience expectations,\" Eldridge added.",
      "\"That said, if anyone can do it, it's Mel Gibson.\"",

    "story": [
      "Health care took center stage during the Covid-19 pandemic.\u00a0 And in the five years since, the industry has experienced change and innovation.",
      "The field of medicine has undergone significant changes since the COVID-19 pandemic, with the biggest breakthrough right at our fingertips: telemedicine.\u00a0 While it may feel like a \"normal\" part of healthcare now, connected technology dominated how Americans saw doctors during the pandemic. \"Before the pandemic, virtual care was available, but it was not widely used. Now telemedicine is mainstream,\" says Dr. Michael Aziz, an Attending Physician at New York's Lenox Hill Hospital.",
      "According to one study, telemedicine encounters increased 766% in the first three months of the COVID outbreak. And while use of the 2-D technology has tapered off, Dr. Aziz, believes still plays a vital role in medical care, \"Especially for people in rural areas. Especially for young professionals. And it offers convenience. But we have so many barriers when it comes to telemedicine.... especially for senior citizens,\u2019 he explains, \"Also, the government has put some many roadblocks for patients to use that. One is the cost. There's a cost associated with that. It's not covered by many insurance.\"",
      "Experts say while telemedicine has been revolutionary, it's best suited for certain ailments, particularly psychiatric services.\u00a0 Dr. Chris Ivany, Psychiatrist and COO of Family Care Center, emphasizes, \"I think it's clear to say that the pandemic certainly had a immediate and negative effect on many Americans' mental health.\"",
      "A recent Gallup poll shows adults 18 to 49 reported a steep drop in their mental health since 2020, with many suffering from depression, anxiety, and isolation.\u00a0 This has led to an increase in Americans seeking help post-crisis.\u00a0 Dr. Ivany notes, \"The stigma to seeking mental health care is definitely decreased over the course of the past five or so years.... but also, in part to just a general recognition that mental health care is part of health care overall.\"\u00a0 Dr. Ivany points to two main reasons we're seeing a growth in mental health care, \"Part of what the pandemic has done is to raise the awareness of mental health issues, challenges across the American population in a way that really hadn't been done really in the past.... And I think the second is the field now is much more flexible in terms of how care can be delivered to people.\"",
      "Another challenge changing the landscape of the industry, a significant reduction in staffing. Dr. Aziz says, \"About 3000 healthcare professionals have died and about 100,000 have retired or changed career... Hospitals have a hard time not only hiring physicians and health care workers, but they have a hard time retaining them.\"",
      "While telemedicine has been a game changer, it\u2019s not the only major innovation to emerge from the pandemic. The production and rollout of the COVID-19 vaccine, along with advancements in rapid testing and antigen tests, are also transformative innovations born out of the pandemic."

      "3 additional ways to protect your privacy",
      "While updating Chrome should fix the vulnerability, below are some security tips you can follow to further bolster your privacy and security.",
      "1) Have strong antivirus software:\u00a0Hackers often gain access to devices by sending infected emails or documents or by tricking you into clicking a link that downloads malware. You can avoid all of this by installing strong antivirus software that will detect any potential threat before it can take over your device.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "2) Enable two-factor authentication (2FA):\u00a0Many online accounts, including Google, offer two-factor authentication as an extra security measure.\u00a0Enabling 2FA ensures that even if a hacker obtains your password, they still need a second form of verification, such as a code sent to your phone, to access your account. This simple step significantly reduces the chances of unauthorized access.",
      "3) Use a secure password manager:\u00a0A strong password is crucial, but remembering multiple complex passwords can be difficult. A password manager generates, stores and autofills strong passwords for your accounts, reducing the risk of password-related breaches. Avoid using the same password across different sites and always opt for long, unique passwords. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 here.",
      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "This incident serves as yet another reminder that even the most secure systems are never truly invulnerable, especially when state-backed or highly skilled actors are in play. While Google\u2019s quick response is commendable, it also highlights the never-ending cat-and-mouse game between security teams and cybercriminals. If you are using Chrome, update it now.",

    "summary": "This phishing kit bypasses 2FA via session hijacking and real-time credential theft. Kurt \u201cCyberGuy&quot; Knutsson offers four ways to stay safe from Astaroth phishing attacks.",
    "story": [
      "Tech expert Kurt Knutsson joins \"Fox & Friends\" to warn of new cyberscams and his tips on how to avoid them.",
      "Phishing attacks are everywhere, and most of us can spot the obvious ones. Even if someone falls for one and hands over their password, two-factor authentication (2FA) usually adds a crucial layer of protection. But a new phishing kit making the rounds can bypass 2FA entirely by using session hijacking and real-time credential interception.",
      "Known as Astaroth, this tool intercepts and manipulates traffic between your device and legitimate authentication services like Gmail, Yahoo and Microsoft. Since it grabs everything in real time, it completely bypasses 2FA and gives attackers full access to your account.",
      "Stay protected & informed! Get security alerts & expert tech tips \u2013 sign up for Kurt\u2019s The CyberGuy Report now.",
      "Illustration of a hacker at work (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How Astaroth works",
      "Astaroth is a next-level phishing kit that takes scamming to a whole new level. Instead of using basic fake login pages like traditional phishing kits, it works as a middleman between your device and the real authentication service while silently grabbing everything needed to break in.",
      "The attack begins when you click on a phishing link and land on a malicious site that looks identical to the real one. Since the site has valid SSL certificates, there are no red flags, no security warnings and no sketchy pop-ups. When you enter your login details, including username, password, device info and IP address, Astaroth snatches them up before passing the request to the actual website.",
      "Two-factor authentication is not a problem for Astaroth. It intercepts one-time passwords the second they are entered, whether they come from an authenticator app, SMS or a push notification. The stolen codes are instantly sent to the attacker through a web panel or Telegram alert, so they can use them before they expire.",
      "The real kicker is that Astaroth also grabs session cookies, which are the small bits of data that keep users logged in after authentication. Attackers can inject these cookies into their own browsers, skipping the need for passwords or two-factor authentication altogether. Once they have the session, they are in with no extra steps required.",
      "An example of what the victim and attacker would see (SlashNext) (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "BEST ANTIVIRUS FOR MAC, PC, IPHONES AND ANDROIDS - CYBERGUY PICKS",
      "Astaroth is shockingly advanced",
      "As reported by cybersecurity company\u00a0SlashNext, Astaroth stands out from other phishing kits because of its ability to intercept credentials in real time, automate attacks and resist takedown efforts. Traditional phishing depends on tricking victims into entering their credentials on fake login pages, but Astaroth removes that step entirely.",
      "Beyond its advanced capabilities, Astaroth comes with features that make it appealing to cybercriminals. It uses bulletproof hosting to stay online despite law enforcement efforts, receives frequent updates to bypass security patches and follows a structured payment model. For $2,000, buyers get six months of continuous upgrades. To build trust, the creators even let hackers test the phishing kit before purchasing.",
      "Astaroth is widely available through Telegram and underground cybercrime forums. The anonymity of these platforms makes it difficult for authorities to track distribution.",

      "1) Avoid unknown links and use strong antivirus software: Remember that no matter how advanced the malware is, it still needs input from you. In most cases, an attacker will require you to click a link before they can steal your data. For example, for Astaroth to work, you have to click a link, visit a malicious website and enter your credentials. If you don\u2019t click the link, you stay clear of the malware.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS device.",
      "2) Double-check sites:\u00a0Always verify website addresses and use bookmarks for trusted sites. Instead of clicking on links in emails or messages, manually type the URL or use a trusted bookmark. This minimizes the risk of landing on a fraudulent page designed to mimic a legitimate website.",
      "3) Update your devices:\u00a0You might wonder how keeping your devices updated helps against malware like Astaroth. While it doesn\u2019t directly prevent an attack, it ensures the situation doesn\u2019t get worse.\u00a0Keeping your operating system and applications up to date with the latest security patches closes vulnerabilities that malware might exploit, making it harder for attackers to gain a foothold on your device.",
      "4) Avoid typing passwords:\u00a0Avoid entering passwords whenever possible to reduce the risk of credential theft. Instead, use authentication methods like passkeys, Google Sign-In or Apple Sign-In.",
      "A passkey is a feature that uses cryptographic key pairs to verify your identity, eliminating the need for traditional passwords. It allows you to sign in to apps and websites using the same process you use to unlock your device, such as biometrics, PIN or pattern.",
      "Google Sign-In is a feature that allows you to log in to third-party apps or websites using their Google Account credentials. It simplifies the sign-in process by eliminating the need to create and remember separate usernames and passwords for each service. You can sign in via a \"Sign in with Google\" button, a Google sign-in prompt or automatic sign-in if previously authorized.",
      "Apple Sign-In is a feature that enables you to privately sign in to participating third-party apps and websites using your Apple ID. It offers a fast, easy and more private way to authenticate without the need to create new accounts or remember additional passwords. To set up an account to \"Sign in with Apple,\" when a participating website or app asks you to set up or upgrade an account, do the following: Tap Sign in with Apple. Follow the onscreen instructions. Some apps (and websites) don\u2019t request your name and email address. In this case, you simply authenticate with Face ID or Touch ID (depending on your model), then start using the app.\u00a0Others may ask for your name and email address to set up a personalized account. When an app asks for this information, Sign in with Apple displays your name and the personal email address from your Apple Account for you to review.",
      "These methods rely on cryptographic keys or secure tokens, making it much harder for attackers to intercept your login information, even if they manage to trick you into visiting a malicious site.",
      "FBI WARNS OF DANGEROUS NEW \u2018SMISHING\u2019 SCAM TARGETING YOUR PHONE",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "Astaroth shows just how far phishing kits have come, taking things beyond the usual tricks and bypassing 2FA with ease. It\u2019s a reminder that no matter how secure we think our systems are, there\u2019s always a smarter attack waiting to exploit the gaps. Cybercriminals are adapting fast, and while traditional defenses may not cut it anymore, there are still steps you can take to fight back: use passwordless logins, stay updated and keep learning about these evolving threats.",

Many older adults are particularly vulnerable as they didn't grow up with today's technology and may be less familiar with AI's capabilities. This knowledge gap makes it harder to recognize when AI is being used maliciously.

A password manager can generate and store strong, unique passwords for all your accounts, reducing the risk of password reuse and making it easier to maintain good password hygiene. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed Password Managers of 2025 here.",
      "4. Enable two-factor authentication (2FA) on all accounts: 2FA adds an extra layer of security by requiring a second form of verification, such as a code sent to your phone, in addition to your password.",
      "5. Receive MFA codes via an authenticator app on your phone rather than email when possible: Using an\u00a0authenticator app like Microsoft Authenticator or Google Authenticator is more secure than receiving codes via email. Authenticator apps generate time-based one-time passcodes (TOTPs) that are not transmitted over email or SMS, reducing the risk of interception by hackers. Additionally, authenticator apps often support biometric authentication and push notifications, making the verification process both secure and convenient.",
      "6. Use a strong antivirus software: Modern cybersecurity threats are evolving rapidly, with AI being used to create more convincing phishing attacks, deepfake scams, and malware. Investing in strong antivirus software can help identify and block suspicious activity before it reaches you. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "7. Trust your intuition and verify: If something feels \"off,\" like you notice unusual phrasing or strange background noises, trust your instincts. Don't let fraudsters create a false sense of urgency. If you receive a communication claiming to be from a financial institution, call that institution directly using the official number from its website.",
      "8. Monitor your accounts: Review account statements regularly for suspicious transactions. Don\u2019t hesitate to request a credit freeze if you suspect your data has been compromised.",

Initially seen in targeted attacks, it has now gone mainstream, affecting industries like hospitality and healthcare.",
      "The scam begins when you visit a hacked or malicious website and see a fake CAPTCHA-style prompt. Clicking the \"I\u2019m not a robot\" button triggers a set of instructions asking you to press specific keyboard shortcuts. First, you are told to press Windows + R, which opens the Windows Run dialog. Then you are instructed to press CTRL + V, which pastes a malicious script copied from the website\u2019s virtual clipboard. If you press enter, a script is executed that downloads and runs malware.",

      "Cybercriminals are using phishing emails and malicious websites to spread ClickFix. The hospitality industry has been heavily targeted, with attackers impersonating Booking.com and sending fake emails referencing guest reviews or promotions. Clicking on links in these emails directs you to a ClickFix trap. Healthcare workers have also been targeted, with malicious code embedded into the widely used physical therapy site HEP2go.",
      "Once ClickFix is on your PC, it installs various types of malware, including password stealers like XWorm, Lumma Stealer and DanaBot, which extract your login credentials and financial information.

Just like in the current campaign, attackers prompted victims to click a button that copied a PowerShell \"fix\" to the clipboard, then paste and run it in a Run dialog or PowerShell prompt.",

The scam started with an email containing a link to a Google Meet session, often disguised to appear as if it were from the victim's organization.

      "2. Don\u2019t click links from unverified emails and use strong antivirus software:\u00a0Many ClickFix attacks start with phishing emails that impersonate trusted services like Booking.com or Google Meet. Always verify the sender before clicking on links. If an email seems urgent or unexpected, go directly to the company\u2019s official website instead of clicking any links inside the email.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "3. Enable two-factor authentication:\u00a0Enable two-factor authentication whenever possible. This adds an extra layer of security by requiring a second form of verification, such as a code sent to your phone, in addition to your password.",
      "4. Keep devices updated: Regularly\u00a0updating your operating system, browser and security software ensures you have the latest patches against known vulnerabilities. Cybercriminals exploit outdated systems, so enabling automatic updates is a simple but effective way to stay protected.",
      "5. Monitor your accounts for suspicious activity and change your passwords:\u00a0If you\u2019ve interacted with a suspicious website, phishing email or fake login page, check your online accounts for any unusual activity. Look for unexpected login attempts, unauthorized password resets or financial transactions that you don\u2019t recognize. If anything seems off, change your passwords immediately and report the activity to the relevant service provider. Also, consider using a\u00a0password manager to generate and store complex passwords. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 here.",
      "6. Invest in personal data removal service: Consider using a service that monitors your personal information and alerts you to potential breaches or unauthorized use of your data. These services can provide early warning signs of identity theft or other malicious activities resulting from ClickFix or similar attacks. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",

      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "ClickFix is a reminder that malware doesn\u2019t always rely on complex exploits. It often just needs you to follow the wrong instructions. Attackers are refining their methods, making scams like fake CAPTCHAs, phishing emails and deceptive pop-ups more convincing than ever. The best way to stay ahead is to question anything that seems even slightly off. If a website asks you to run commands or paste something into PowerShell, it\u2019s a red flag. If an email pressures you into clicking a link, verify it first.",

      "In addition, Iran could again turn to its close ties to terrorist networks to transfer missile capabilities to war-torn areas like Yemen, which could enable it to strike further south into the Indian Ocean by some 800 miles.",

      "Iran\u2019s supreme leader, Ali Khamenei, issued a warning on Monday and said it would respond\u00a0\"decisively and immediately\" to any threat issued by the U.S. after Trump said there \"will be bombing\" and likely more tariffs if Tehran does not agree to a nuclear deal with Washington.",
      "\"The enmity from the U.S. and Israel has always been there. They threaten to attack us, which we don\u2019t think is very probable, but if they commit any mischief, they will surely receive a strong reciprocal blow,\" Khamenei said according to a Reuters report.",

      "Despite Iran\u2019s refusal and warning directed at both the U.S. and Israel, Behnam Ben Taleblu, an Iran expert and senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, said Khamenei\u2019s comments are an attempt to \"buy time\" while balancing growing external and internal pressures on his regime.",
      "\"At once, Khamenei sought to both downplay the chances of President Trump or Israel taking military action while also looking to deter such an eventuality due to the regime\u2019s own policies,\" he told Fox News Digital. \"This is a tightrope Khamenei will increasingly be forced to walk as he plays for time and engages in nuclear escalation.",

      "Over the weekend, Trump said he was \"pissed off\" over comments made by Putin on Friday when he suggested the work Washington was doing to negotiate a ceasefire with Russia and Ukraine was moot because he believes the government in Kyiv to be illegitimate and therefore cannot sign any deals.",
      "\"If Russia and I are unable to make a deal on stopping the bloodshed in Ukraine, and if I think it was Russia\u2019s fault \u2026 I am going to put secondary tariffs on oil, on all oil coming out of Russia,\" Trump said, noting that tariffs could be as high as 50%.",
      "The president later said his ire could \"dissipate quickly\" if Putin \"does the right thing,\" and once again noted he has \"a very good relationship with [Putin].\"",
      "However, the Kremlin chief, who reportedly has another call scheduled with Trump this week, has not responded to Trump\u2019s heated comments.",
      "The chief spokesman for Putin, Dmitry Peskov, said on Monday that Russia will continue to work on \"restoring\" relations with Washington that he said were \"damaged by the Biden administration\" following Russia\u2019s illegal invasion of Ukraine, and noted that Putin remains in \"open contact\" with Trump.",
      "However, Putin\u2019s lack of public response and the toned-down statements from the Kremlin are all part of Putin\u2019s broader strategy, former DIA intelligence officer and Russia expert, Rebekah Koffler, told Fox News Digital.",

      "\"The fact that President Trump reportedly got mad and used those words means to Putin that he finally got to him, the way he got to Biden, Obama, and others who called him a killer and other derogatory words,\" she continued.",
      "\"Putin now feels that not only Russia has an\u00a0upper hand on the battlefield over Ukraine and in terms of total combat potential over NATO, but he also was able to unbalance Trump,\" Koffler explained. \"That is the whole point - it\u2019s a judo move.\"",

      "As Democrats celebrate a battleground-state win in the most expensive judicial campaign in U.S. history, President Donald Trump and the GOP are confronting a worrying early sign about what the intense spotlight on Elon Musk\u2019s influence means for the party.",
      "Musk, the billionaire White House adviser, played a starring role in the race, using personal funds and allied outside groups to put more than $15 million behind former Wisconsin Attorney General Brad Schimel, the Trump-endorsed candidate who ran against Madison County Circuit Judge Susan Crawford. Crawford and her allies responded in kind, using Musk as a foil and scoring a decisive win.",
      "Though the race was technically nonpartisan, there were intense partisan overtones \u2014 and it functionally transformed into a proxy vote on Trump\u2019s first two months in office and especially on Musk, who has become one of the most powerful people in Republican politics since Trump won last year.",
      "Yet while the results were not promising in Republicans\u2019 first statewide test of the second Trump administration, Trump advisers are \u2014 at least for now \u2014 brushing off the loss, noting it was an off-year election with lower turnout than the recent presidential race.",
      "\u201cThe results are what they are. It\u2019s an off-year race and predictive of nothing,\u201d a Trump adviser said. \u201cI don\u2019t think you can read too much into it, including Elon\u2019s role.\u201d",
      "A source familiar with Musk\u2019s thinking was on the same page, brushing off the loss as the result of an \u201cuphill battle.\u201d",
      "\u201cElon was a happy warrior this entire race, knowing full well it was an uphill battle. The only reason Schimel was able to make this a race was because Elon got involved,\u201d said the source familiar with Musk\u2019s thinking. \u201cHe put the Democrats on defense and made them empty their coffers in a race that should\u2019ve never been competitive.\u201d",
      "The person added that Musk\u2019s effort to help Republican campaigns will continue.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s going to continue to be active and isn\u2019t ceding anything to Democrats,\u201d the person said.",
      "Even so, on the heels of Schimel\u2019s loss, Republicans are assessing how Musk\u2019s spotlight-stealing influence will shape key political races headed into the midterms in 2026, when Republicans will defend a narrow House majority. While turnout in Wisconsin did not hit presidential levels, it did come close to the number of people who voted in the 2022 midterms in the state \u2014 closer to a regular election than a low-turnout blip.",
      "\u201cElon is great for Trump because he\u2019s a shield,\u201d said a Republican operative who advised Musk on the Wisconsin race. But, the person added, the ability to attract so much heat is \u201cbad for elections, because he energizes the Democrats.\u201d",
      "The recent NBC News poll found a majority of voters nationwide (51%) holding negative views of Musk, while 39% viewed him positively. Neither Musk nor Trump had spoken publicly about the Wisconsin result as of 11 p.m. Tuesday.",
      "The White House\u2019s political arm, including Musk, played an \u201cunprecedented\u201d role in the contest, highlighting the importance of the race to Trump \u2014 and the stinging nature of the loss. Trump endorsed Schimel and publicly hyped the importance of the race, but much of the attention in the weeks leading up to Election Day were squarely focused on Musk, who was Trump\u2019s biggest donor last year and has signaled ambitions to use his massive wealth to influence races in the future.",
      "Beyond giving huge sums of political cash to Schimel, Musk set up a petition contest that made those who signed up to fight \u201cactivist\u201d judges eligible for a $1 million prize, and he also held a rally for Schimel on Sunday. At the rally, Musk said the race could \u201caffect the entire destiny of humanity.\u201d",
      "\u201cI would call it unprecedented,\u201d former Wisconsin GOP chair Andrew Hitt said of the White House\u2019s role in the state race. \u201cNever been done before in terms of their involvement.\u201d",
      "He said that the race was without question viewed through a Trump-Musk lens as it started to gain more national attention but that it was not always just Democrats trying to make that brand stick.",
      "\u201cI think as the race nationalized, I would say in some ways the right defined ourselves as having the Trump-Musk candidate,\u201d Hitt said. \u201cThe left really did not have to do that; it was conservatives who did that.\u201d",
      "Hitt was surprised at how much Crawford was winning by late Tuesday, but he said he did think Musk helped energize grassroots Republicans in the state after he got fully involved.",
      "\u201cHe helped close the gap, I believe,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will see where the margin ultimately lands, but it felt like Elon was energizing people. Maybe not? We will see where the final numbers land.\u201d",
      "Trump beat Vice President Kamala Harris in the state by less than 1 percentage point last year \u2014 the third straight time the presidential race has come down to decimal points in Wisconsin.",
      "\u201cWisconsin is a big state politically, and the Supreme Court has a lot to do with elections in Wisconsin,\u201d Trump said last week. \u201cWinning Wisconsin is a big deal, so therefore the Supreme Court choice ... it\u2019s a big race.\u201d",
      "But Trump supporters focused Tuesday on wins they notched in two Florida congressional seats, which will help ensure Republicans maintain their slim House majority. Democrats made some gains amid low turnout in the deep-red seats, but both GOP candidates still won comfortably.",
      "\u201cDemocrats held Wisconsin\u2019s Supreme Court seat while Republicans won both congressional races in Florida,\u201d a former Trump adviser said. \u201cRepublicans have maintained our majority in the House, and, most importantly, Democrats will not be able to impede on President Donald J. Trump\u2019s America First agenda.\u201d"

    "summary": "Republicans also got key reinforcements for their slim House majority at an important moment. And Democrats made gains compared to 2024 in each key race.",
    "story": [
      "Tuesday\u2019s elections in Wisconsin and Florida were kind to the favorites but not to billionaire White House adviser Elon Musk. And that result could stick around long after the votes are counted.",
      "State Circuit Judge Susan Crawford won a pivotal election to maintain liberal control of Wisconsin\u2019s Supreme Court despite a big push from Musk and his millions, while two Republican candidates in Florida won special House elections in deep-red districts. But even though their candidates won just one of the three contests on the ballot, it was a good night for Democrats.",
      "They spent heavily to back Crawford, who cruised to victory over Circuit Judge Brad Schimel without much suspense Tuesday night.",
      "And while Republicans will pad their slim House majority in Washington with two more reinforcements at a critical legislative moment, the Democratic candidates significantly improved on the party\u2019s November performance, raising questions about whether Democrats can keep up that momentum in next year\u2019s midterm elections.",
      "Here are the key takeaways from Tuesday\u2019s elections, including what they mean for politics and other campaigns this year and next year.",
      "Democrats have a new boogeyman",
      "Just months after Democrats lost a presidential election while failing to generate strong enough backlash against Donald Trump, it appears they\u2019ve found a new electoral boogeyman in Musk.",
      "Recent polls have shown Musk\u2019s favorability ratings are lower than Trump\u2019s, both in Wisconsin and nationally, so it makes sense that the pro-Crawford campaign would lean in on Musk in their messaging. And lean in they did \u2014 Crawford and Democrats repeatedly evoked him on the stump, and her campaign ran a TV ad accusing him of \u201ctrying to buy Schimel a seat on the Supreme Court.\u201d",
      "Musk went to great lengths to help Schimel. His super PAC spent more than $12.5 million in independent expenditures, Musk donated $3 million to the state Republican Party, his super PAC controversially doled out million-dollar checks to three voters who signed a conservative-leaning petition, he traveled to Wisconsin to campaign in the race\u2019s final days, and he regularly posted about the race on X, his social media platform.",
      "The focus on Musk is especially notable because Democrats seemed to intentionally avoid highlighting Trump\u2019s endorsement of Schimel \u2014 a move strategists in both parties said was coyly designed to avoid overtly juicing turnout among Trump-loving voters in a state he narrowly carried in two of the past three presidential races.",
      "Democrats and groups backing Crawford didn\u2019t mention Trump\u2019s endorsement of Schimel once in TV ads, choosing instead to go all in on villainizing Musk. (Schimel leaned heavily into Trump\u2019s support, running ads in the final 11 days of the campaign that emphasized his ties to Trump.)",
      "Time will tell whether Democrats can replicate the strategy in races in which Musk isn\u2019t personally playing such a major role or whether his utility as a boogeyman diminishes if he eventually steps away from the White House.",
      "And Musk\u2019s potential liabilities need to be taken in full context \u2014 that is, he has shown that his willingness to lend his wealth to politics extends beyond supporting Trump, and his staggering wealth, combined with his unique cult of personality, makes him an important ally for Republicans. Buckle up for an expensive \u2014 and loud \u2014 2026 midterm election, with Musk in the middle.",
      "Republicans\u2019 2024 playbook wasn\u2019t enough in Wisconsin",
      "In the final weeks of the Wisconsin race, Republicans and groups supporting Schimel hammered Crawford with ads over transgender issues (in addition to highlighting endorsements from Trump and Musk).",
      "That move very closely resembled the tack Republicans and Trump used down the homestretch of their successful 2024 campaign against Democrats in Wisconsin and several other swing states.",
      "Each side used ads to paint its opponent as soft on crime, and groups supporting Schimel slammed Crawford in ads over her role in sentencing in specific cases involving convicted sex offenders while they boosted Schimel for his role in delivering tough sentences against criminals.",
      "That strategy closely resembled moves Sen. Ron Johnson and groups supporting him made down the stretch against Democratic challenger Mandela Barnes in the competitive 2022 Senate race in the battleground state.",
      "But Crawford and groups supporting her hit back on crime in ads themselves, in the hope of insulating her from the attacks.",
      "The pro-Trump playbook did work in the two special elections in Florida\u2019s 1st and 6th Congressional Districts to replace GOP former Reps. Michael Waltz, now Trump\u2019s national security adviser, and Matt Gaetz. Republicans worked to energize their base, looking to boost GOP turnout in the ruby-red districts.",
      "Trump held tele-town halls for both Republican candidates, and outside groups launched ads in the final days of the race reminding voters that they had Trump\u2019s support. And Republicans ultimately averted anything resembling a close call in two solid-red districts.",
      "State Chief Financial Officer Jimmy Patronis was projected to win the 1st District race by 15 points, and GOP state Sen. Randy Fine was projected to win by 14 points. But their margins were around half as large as Trump\u2019s in November.",
      "House GOP expands majority",
      "Tuesday\u2019s elections affected more than the world of campaign politics. In Congress, the pair of GOP victories in Florida will give Republican leaders a little more leeway to pass their major priorities, since they will have a 220-213 majority in the House once Fine and Patronis are sworn in.",
      "If every sitting member votes, Republicans can afford to lose three GOP votes and still pass legislation even if all Democrats oppose a measure. (Two Democratic-held seats are vacant.)",
      "Patronis and Fine will head to Congress at a key moment for the GOP, with Republicans trying to piece together a sweeping budget proposal to tackle Trump\u2019s top priorities, including extending his 2017 tax cuts.",
      "Fine has signaled that he will support Trump\u2019s priorities, telling him at last week\u2019s tele-town hall, \u201cI stand behind you 100%, and you\u2019ll have no greater warrior for your agenda than me.\u201d",
      "Patronis is also a Trump ally, though the self-described fiscal conservative told NBC News in January that he could clash with GOP leaders on government spending, saying, \u201cI will not waste people\u2019s money, and I have no problem calling out absurdity.\u201d",
      "Asked in an interview last week whether there were any elements of a possible budget proposal he wouldn\u2019t support, such as cuts to Medicaid, Patronis demurred, saying he hadn\u2019t given much thought to \u201cthose type of hypotheticals.\u201d",
      "\u201cMy principles are making sure that we\u2019re either restoring dollars back to the citizens of CD-1, we spend their dollars more efficient,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s good to create a path where you\u2019re taking away something from a benefit or entitlement that somebody is counting on. I do like giving people options.\u201d",
      "Democrats still have some energy",
      "Trump\u2019s victory in November might have deflated Democrats, but the party showed some signs of life in Tuesday\u2019s elections.",
      "Democrats in the Trump era have swamped Republicans in fundraising, and Tuesday\u2019s races demonstrate that the fundraising boom hasn\u2019t stopped; meanwhile, Democrats continue to enjoy a key advantage on the airwaves.",
      "Crawford\u2019s fundraising helped her outpace Schimel on the airwaves, spending more than $26 million on ads to Schimel\u2019s almost $14 million, according to the ad-tracking firm AdImpact. While GOP outside groups jumped in to help close the gap, Crawford\u2019s advantage is notable because outside groups have to pay higher rates to run ads.",
      "In Florida, Democrats fell short in the deep-red House districts, but they raised millions of dollars in the process. Democrat Josh Weil, a public school teacher, had raked in over $10 million as of Monday, while Fine, his opponent in the 6th District, had raised $2 million, including $600,000 from himself.",
      "In the 1st District, Valimont had raised $6.5 million as of March 12, while Patronis had raised $2.1 million.",
      "Their losses also underscore the limits of seemingly unlimited money, with the well-funded candidates unable to overcome the deeply Republican slants of both districts. But they did cut into that advantage.",
      "Both Weil and Valimont also outperformed Vice President Kamala Harris in November, with Weil\u2019s vote share improving on Harris\u2019 by 8 points and Valimont surpassing Harris\u2019 vote share by 11 points. Crawford also well outperformed Harris on Tuesday night, carrying in the high single digits a state that Harris lost months earlier.",
      "Democrats touted those margins, noting the party has overperformed in several special elections this year for state legislative seats.",
      "Battleground voters tuned in",
      "Wisconsin\u2019s Supreme Court race had a slew of factors all coming to a head Tuesday \u2014 Musk, Trump, tens of millions of dollars in spending, a battle for partisan control of the court \u2014 and what did it all add up to? Record turnout.",
      "Votes are still being counted, but turnout has already eclipsed the 2023 Wisconsin Supreme Court race\u2019s turnout of 1.8 million votes, and both 2025 candidates will end up eclipsing the 2023 candidates\u2019 vote totals. In addition, the number of voters in this year\u2019s contest could approach the number that cast their ballots in the midterm in 2022, when more than 2.6 million people voted in competitive statewide races.",
      "Take Fond du Lac County, where the Republican Party was founded in 1854. This year, more than 39,000 people cast their ballots there, between the 30,000 who voted in the 2023 Supreme Court race and the almost 47,000 who voted for governor in 2022.",
      "In Door County, a swingy county north of Green Bay that has sided with the presidential winner in six of the last seven presidential elections (it failed to do so last year), Tuesday\u2019s turnout of 15,300 trends closer to 2022\u2019s 17,300 than 2023\u2019s 12,300.",
      "Wisconsin already had nearly 2.2 million votes tallied by midnight ET, with a chunk of votes still outstanding, according to the NBC News Decision Desk. If that projection holds, the race will end up just shy of turnout in the 2022 midterms, an impressive mark in one of the most politically engaged states in the country.",
      "Until we get some signs pointing in another direction, don\u2019t expect the consistently high turnout in Trump-era elections to dissipate any time soon."

    "story": [
      "The NFL has decided that the chain gang no longer measures up.",
      "During the 2025 season, the NFL will determine whether teams have made first downs by using Sony\u2019s Hawk-Eye system of six 8K cameras placed around every stadium, which will optically track the position of the ball. In announcing the change Tuesday, the NFL said in a news release that the technology was tested \u201cextensively\u201d last season.",
      "The chain gang, the nickname of the team of officials who walk onto the field in critical moments to measure whether the ball has gone 10 yards, will \u201cremain on the field in a secondary capacity,\u201d the league said. But they will remain background players as the cameras judge the difference between where the ball is spotted and the line to gain.",
      "\u201cAs on-field officials are notified of the measurement outcome, virtual recreations of measurements are produced in real time for the in-stadium and broadcast audience,\u201d the league said.",
      "According to the NFL, the Hawk-Eye system will be operated from its centralized, New York-based officiating center, where it will be integrated with the league\u2019s existing system for evaluating replays. Measuring using the Hawk-Eye system takes around 30 seconds, which the league claims saves up to 40 seconds from using the traditional method.",
      "In an increasingly tech-oriented sport, the use of the chain gang had become an anachronism and its efficacy a never-ending source of debate. The latest incident came in January, when Josh Allen, the Buffalo Bills quarterback and league Most Valuable Player, was ruled short of a first down during the AFC championship game against Kansas City, although replays suggested he had reached a first down.\u00a0The camera-assisted measurement system would not have necessarily led to a first down in that case, however, because the referees\u2019 spot of the ball remains paramount \u2014 and the spot remains at times an imperfect judgment call made by an official.",
      "Hawk-Eye cameras will be installed in every NFL stadium, as well international stadiums hosting NFL games.",
      "The move is in line with a trend of major leagues\u2019 increasingly relying on computerized analysis in hope of reducing human error. Major League Baseball for the first time used a computerized system to determine balls and strikes during spring training this year, although the \u201crobot umpires\u201d are not working the regular season."

    "story": [
      "Steep federal funding cuts have forced public health officials in one of Texas\u2019 most populous counties \u2014 Dallas \u2014 to cancel dozens of vaccination clinics and lay off 21 workers on the front lines of combatting the state\u2019s growing measles outbreak.",
      "\u201cI just had to tell our commissioners this morning that we\u2019ve had to cancel over 50 different clinics in our community,\u201d said Dr. Philip Huang, director and health authority for the Dallas County Health and Human Services Department. Many of the clinics had been planned for schools in areas with low vaccination rates, he said.",
      "The vaccines, which included measles, mumps and rubella shots, were meant to be given free to families.",
      "The money being cut \u2014 $11.4 billion nationwide \u2014 was originally allocated to aid community health departments during the pandemic. Local public health officials have more recently been using the Covid funds for other public health initiatives, such as measles prevention, surveillance and testing.",
      "Last week however, the Department of Health and Human Services announced that it would \u201cno longer waste billions of taxpayer dollars responding to a non-existent pandemic that Americans moved on from years ago.\u201d",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s very short-sighted and not understanding of the way public health works,\u201d Huang said. \u201cBeing prepared for Covid helps build our capacity to be able to respond to other issues.\u201d",
      "Huang said his team was still assessing the exact amount of money slashed in his budget, but estimated it to be in the millions.",
      "As of Tuesday, 422 measles had been reported by the Texas Department of State Health Services. None are in Dallas County, but Huang said the cuts would leave his community vulnerable to cases.",
      "Eleven full-time and 10 part-time staffers were let go, he said. The majority were health care providers giving vaccines, epidemiologists and lab staff involved with measles surveillance and prevention.",
      "Staff operating vaccine clinics in West Texas, which remains the epicenter of the measles outbreak, said those clinics are continuing as planned for now.",
      "Other states reporting measles outbreaks include Kansas with 23 cases, Oklahoma with 10 cases, and New Mexico with 48 cases. And public health officials in Ohio have identified at least a dozen cases."

    "published": "Tue, 01 Apr 2025 22:05:56 GMT",
    "summary": "Mahmoud Khalil, who was studying at Columbia, and Alireza Doroudi, from the University of Alabama, are both being held at an ICE processing center in Jena, Louisiana.",
    "story": [
      "At least three students recently detained by the Trump administration and put in deportation proceedings have been taken to highly remote detention centers in rural Louisiana that human rights groups have called \u201ca black hole.\u201d",
      "Students Mahmoud Khalil, Rumeysa Ozturk and Alireza Doroudi were arrested near their homes, then taken hundreds of miles away to desolate, rural detention centers in a state that, since President Donald Trump's first administration, has become an increasingly critical part of the country\u2019s immigrant detention apparatus.",
      "The federal government has broad authority to transfer immigrants facing deportation to different facilities. But advocates and experts said that there have been major human rights abuses in facilities in this region and that the Trump administration has sent the students to a very conservative jurisdiction that is highly favorable to its immigration policy goals.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re being placed in facilities that have pretty horrendous conditions, a lot of difficulties with access to counsel and in what is really a more hostile legal jurisdiction to fight their case for the right to remain in the United States,\u201d said Mary Yanik, the director of the Immigrant Rights Clinic at Tulane Law School in New Orleans. Yanik is also an associate law professor at the university.",
      "The Department of Homeland Security did not comment on its decision to detain the students in Louisiana, allegations against facilities in the state or the role the facilities play in the administration\u2019s immigration agenda. The White House did not respond to a request for comment. In court documents related to the arrest of Khalil, the administration said overcrowded facilities and bedbugs in the Northeast led to its decision to send him to Louisiana.",
      "Khalil, a legal permanent resident and pro-Palestinian protest leader at Columbia University, was arrested at his apartment building in New York City on March 8, before being shuttled to a detention center in New Jersey and then taken some 1,000 miles away to the Central Louisiana ICE Processing Center in Jena, Louisiana.",
      "Khalil\u2019s lawyers are fighting to have him returned to the Northeast and released in a case challenging his arrest and detention that was recently moved to a New Jersey court. Meanwhile, his separate deportation proceedings have begun playing out in front of an immigration judge in Louisiana.",
      "Last week, Alireza Doroudi, a doctoral student from Iran who was studying at the University of Alabama, was arrested off campus by federal immigration authorities with little known about his case. Immigration and Customs Enforcement\u2019s detainee locator has since revealed Doroudi was also taken to the Central Louisiana ICE Processing Center in Jena.",
      "The same day, Tufts University doctoral student Rumeysa Ozturk, a Turkish national who was in the United States with a valid student visa, was pulled off the street on her way to break her Ramadan fast with friends in an arrest by plainclothes agents captured on video.",
      "She was taken to the South Louisiana ICE Processing Center in Basile, Louisiana, which holds female detainees.",
      "Ozturk was transferred to Louisiana without the administration notifying her legal team, her lawyers said in court documents. The documents said that her location was withheld for nearly 24 hours. Her lawyers said moving Ozturk to Louisiana was consistent with \u201cICE\u2019s pattern and practice of moving people detained for their speech to distant locations incommunicado and in secret.\u201d",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio said last week\u00a0that the State Department has revoked 300 or more student visas, as the White House increasingly targets foreign-born students whose main transgression seems to be activism. The administration has accused some of the students of engaging in activities and activism supporting Hamas, which the students and their attorneys deny.",
      "Some considerations the federal government takes when placing immigrants in detention are how long someone might be in detention, the current availability of beds as well as a person\u2019s nationality, said Kathleen Bush-Joseph, a policy analyst with the U.S. Immigration Policy Program at the Migration Policy Institute, a nonpartisan think tank.",
      "\u201cDeportation proceedings for people who are detained move much faster than those who are released, because the immigration courts prioritize those cases,\u201d she said.",
      "Louisiana became a hub for holding thousands of immigrants in ICE custody during Trump\u2019s first term, as the administration expanded the detention of migrants and asylum-seekers.",
      "\u201cLouisiana has detained more immigrants than any other state, save Texas,\u201d Yanik said.",
      "There are currently more than 7,000 immigrants detained by ICE in Louisiana, according to the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse based at Syracuse University. There are nearly 48,000 people in ICE custody nationwide, the highest number since 2019.",
      "Reports of human rights abuses",
      "NBC News has previously reported on allegations of human rights abuses in Louisiana detention facilities. In 2024, a report by the Department of Homeland Security documented problems at the Basile facility including a mosquito infestation and a lack of sufficient medical staff.",
      "In an August 2024 report titled \u201cInside the Black Hole,\u201d multiple groups said they documented \u201csystemic human rights abuses\u201d against immigrants in the facilities, which included the detention centers in Jena and Basile where the students have been taken.",
      "\u201cThere was deprivation of human necessities, abusive and discriminatory treatment. There was medical abuse and neglect,\u201d said Sarah Gillman, a co-author of the report and the director of Strategic U.S. Litigation at the nonprofit Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights.",
      "The report and others have documented for years that detainees also are exposed to unsanitary conditions, including yellow, undrinkable water; moldy food; insect infestations; and inadequate access to basic hygiene supplies.",
      "Gillman said the rights groups also found that in past cases, immigrants detained in Louisiana lacked access to lawyers and faced other major obstacles such as a lack of translators and having to prepare important documents in their deportation cases in English, a language some of them didn't speak.",
      "\u201cWe met many, many, many people who didn\u2019t have access to lawyers who could help them, didn\u2019t have access to their families, didn\u2019t have access, really, to the outside world,\u201d she said.",
      "GEO Group, which runs the facilities where the students are detained, did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the allegations in the report.",
      "ICE did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the report and allegations of human rights abuses in its Louisiana facilities. But it previously told NBC News during the Biden administration that it \u201ctakes its commitment to promoting safe, secure, humane environments for those in its custody very seriously \u2014 the agency provides comprehensive policy and strict oversight for the administrative custody of one of the most transient, diverse populations of any correctional or detention system in the world and holds firm to continuous review of the many factors relevant to the continued operation of each of its facilities.\u201d",
      "The students detained in Louisiana are in deportation proceedings before an immigration judge, in a court system that is separate from the criminal justice system. A concern of immigration attorneys and advocates is that any appeal in the students\u2019 cases would fall under the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which is among the most conservative jurisdictions in the country.",
      "The jurisdiction where an immigrant is detained has \u201cvery different precedents which can really affect the outcomes of immigrants\u2019 cases and requests for everything from release from detention to the grant of asylum or other immigration benefits,\u201d Bush-Joseph said."

      "NEILY, Costa Rica \u2014 After being deported from the U.S. with his wife and 6-year-old son, German Smirnov, a Russian national, is being held at a migrant camp in the Central American country. After more than a month there, he says he feels he is being forced to consider staying there to live.",
      "Smirnov, 36, is among 110 migrants, mostly from Asian and African countries, who have been detained at the Center for Temporary Attention of Migrants (CATEM) since late February and now find themselves in limbo.",
      "Many of the detainees tell Noticias Telemundo they\u2019re confused and torn over the limited options being offered by Costa Rican officials, including applying for asylum there, going back to their home countries, waiting it out in the shelter or officially documenting their case to request asylum in another country. It\u2019s all while enduring high temperatures and poor food and conditions.",
      "But many of the migrants say they don\u2019t have a safe country to return to and little information to help them.",
      "For the first time since the migrants arrived from the U.S., and following weeks of pressure from activists and lawmakers, Costa Rican authorities have opened up the camp to the media. Several migrants who have had their documents confiscated said that they feel they have few choices about what comes next.",
      "\u201cThey tell us nothing here,\u201d Smirnov said. \u201cWe\u2019re here for almost 40 days.\u201d",
      "Smirnov, who had planned on requesting asylum in America before the Trump administration suspended asylum at the Southern border, said it\u2019s impossible to return to Russia after fleeing for political reasons.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s complicated. I\u2019m ready to stay here, but I don\u2019t have anywhere to live,\u201d Smirnov said. \u201cI don\u2019t have a job and I don\u2019t speak the local language.\u201d",
      "Costa Rica is one of several Central American countries that has agreed to serve as a bridge between the U.S. and the migrants, many of whom come from countries like China or India.",
      "So far, six people have fled the camp without authorization or documents, said Omer Badilla, Costa Rica\u2019s deputy minister of the interior and police. Dozens more have been repatriated to their home countries, while the majority remain at the center behind a chain-link fence, forbidden to leave the premises.",
      "Until the migrants make an official choice, passports and other identification documents will remain confiscated, Badilla said. As of Monday, the country had not received a formal asylum request from any of the migrants, Badilla said.",
      "Badilla said that the migrants have all been made aware of their options, particularly about the need to formalize their asylum claims with documents in other countries. But he said that many do not want to speak with authorities.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019ve been told to document the case, and they\u2019re afraid. We only work on documented cases. They\u2019re afraid to talk to the police,\u201d Badilla said. \u201cWe\u2019re working so they can feel confident that we won\u2019t take action against them.\u201d",
      "But Badilla said that the country is guaranteeing that those who feel a \u201cwell-founded fear\u201d of returning to their countries of origin will not be forced to do so.",
      "Smirnov said that, if he returns to Russia, he could be forced to join in Moscow\u2019s war against Ukraine.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019ll put me in jail or send me to war,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s simple, because my country is at war with a neighboring country.\u201d",
      "A St. Petersburg native, Smirnov was\u00a0an elections official who was recruited by the Anti-Corruption Foundation, an organization founded by the late opposition leader Alexei Navalny, to expose fraud in last year\u2019s election. Authorities discovered his agreement with the group, he said, and he was forced to flee Russia.",
      "\u201cThey caught me while I was recording the whole process,\u201d Smirnov said. \u201cMaybe someone betrayed me, I don\u2019t know.\u201d",
      "Smirnov, who was detained for nearly a month in San Diego before being deported to Costa Rica, said his family had hoped to relocate to Australia or Canada. But he said that their requests for help in relocating to a third country have been ignored by authorities.",
      "Mohammad Saber Asadi, who fled Afghanistan with his wife, Najia, and their almost 3-year-old daughter, Asra, said he\u2019s been searching for a path to another country, like Canada or Germany. But without visas in place, he said that authorities have given him only two options: stay in Costa Rica or go back to Afghanistan.",
      "Asadi, who runs a construction company, fled Afghanistan after he was threatened by the Taliban for selling materials to contractors from the United States or other Western countries. Asadi said that he had already been arrested after the Taliban returned to power in 2021, and can\u2019t risk another stint in prison.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know what will happen to me,\u201d Asadi said.",
      "Attempting to start a life in Costa Rica isn\u2019t so simple.",
      "\u201cI would like to go to a country that I can live, that I can make a good future for my family, for my daughter,\u201d Asadi said. \u201cBut here in Costa Rica, I think it\u2019s not possible for me. I don\u2019t know Spanish, I don\u2019t have information about the culture of Costa Rica and I don\u2019t have any family here to support me.\u201d",
      "The conditions at the camp haven\u2019t made their time in detention any easier, either, the migrants said. Alexandra, a Russian migrant who requested to go by her first name out of fear of retaliation from the Russian government, said many in the camp are nervous, stressed and lost. There\u2019s little ventilation amid the over-90-degree weather, and many have fallen ill.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t have air conditioning or fans, some families have sick children, and some women have fainted,\u201d she said.",
      "Asadi also said that while food had been provided by a local restaurant, paid for by the U.S., those meals have since been halted. Migrants have been living on beans and rice on most days, which is particularly difficult for infants, since it\u2019s\u00a0 been challenging to access any baby food. And little drinking water is provided throughout the day.",
      "\u201cWe are not free to go outside of here. Here, it\u2019s like a jail,\u201d Asadi said. \u201cThe children, they cry every day. They cry.\u201d",
      "Costa Rica\u2019s role in U.S. deportations has drawn criticisms for the past few weeks, with immigrant rights advocates saying that the country is complicit in America\u2019s human rights violations. Badilla has said that Costa Rica agreed to accept the migrants \u201cbecause of our history and our customs as human rights protectors,\u201d and that the agreement with the Trump administration isn\u2019t based on any special conditions.",
      "\u201cWe responded to the United States\u2019 government\u2019s request, and we raised our hand to help them,\u201d Badilla said.",
      "Costa Rican President Rodrigo Chaves said at a news conference in February that the country is helping its \u201ceconomically powerful brother from the north.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf they impose a tax in our free zones, it\u2019ll screw us,\u201d Chaves said. \u201cI don\u2019t think they\u2019ll do it, thank God ... Love is repaid with love. ... Two-hundred will come, we treat them well and they will leave.\u201d"

      "Kilmar Abrego Garcia came to the United States from El Salvador in 2011 and is a legal resident protected by a 2019 court order that prevented him from being sent back to his home country.",
      "But in court papers filed Monday, the government admitted that \"on March 15, although ICE was aware of his protection from removal to El Salvador, Abrego Garcia was removed to El Salvador because of an administrative error.\"",
      "Abrego Garcia lives in Maryland with his wife and 5-year-old child, who is autistic and intellectually disabled. The couple both work full-time, the filing says. NBC Washington first reported the deportation, and The Atlantic first reported the \"administrative error.\"",
      "Garcia\u2019s deportation comes as The Trump administration continues to deport hundreds of people to El Salvador, many of them from Venezuela and almost all bound for the maximum-security Terrorist Confinement Center, known by its Spanish acronym CECOT.",
      "The deportation appears to coincide with the departure of three planeloads of people to El Salvador on March 15. Lawyers for some of those who were deported said they were falsely accused of gang affiliations because of their tattoos.",
      "Garcia, his wife, Jennifer Vasquez Sura, and their legal team filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court in Maryland last week calling for Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem to ensure his return to the United States and for the government to stop paying El Salvador to keep him in prison.",
      "In its filing Monday, the government said the U.S. courts do not have jurisdiction to seek his release.",
      "Salvadoran government images show masked guards marching crowds of men with shaven heads inside the largest jail in Latin America.",
      "To her shock, Garcia's wife learned her husband was being detained only after she spotted him in an image in a news article with his head shaved and wearing white overalls, the lawsuit says. The men were kneeling, their faces obscured \u2014 but she said she spotted his tattoos and two scars on his head.",
      "The government, however, alleges that Garcia was an \"active member of the criminal gang MS-13,\" citing an unidentified informant at a 2019 bond hearing.",
      "Garcia's lawyers strenuously deny that and claim the government \"has never produced an iota of evidence to support this unfounded allegation.\" Garcia left El Salvador to escape gang violence, his lawyers say, after gangsters threatened to kill him in an attempt to extort his parents.",
      "Vice President JD Vance weighed into the case and falsely said Tuesday on X that Garcia was a \"convicted MS-13 gang member.\" Garcia has no criminal convictions in the United States or in El Salvador, his legal team said in the lawsuit.",
      "In a follow-up post Tuesday, Vance stood by his comments and called Garcia \"an illegal immigrant with no right to be in our country,\" despite the 2019 protection order against his removal from the country.",
      "\"We disagree that he is an MS-13 gang member.\u00a0The only basis of his gang membership was a confidential informant, there was never any hard and fast proof,\" Garcia\u2019s attorney, Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg, said in a statement to NBC News in response to Vance\u2019s posts.",
      "\"There is a judicial process.\u00a0They could have gone back to the judge who, in 2019, gave him an order of protection and could have asked that judge to lift that order.\u00a0They didn\u2019t do that, they just put him on an airplane,\" Sandoval-Moshenberg added.",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt also addressed the case Tuesday, reiterating the claim that he was a member of MS-13.",
      "On March 12, after he finished his shift as a sheet metal worker and picked up his child, Garcia was pulled over and arrested by Homeland Security agents, one of whom told him his \"status has changed,\" says a lawsuit calling for his release from last week.",
      "Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers told him that his wife had to collect the couple's child within 10 minutes or he would be handed over to Child Protective Services, the filing alleges.",
      "She arrived and found Garcia \"confused, distraught and crying,\" but she got no explanation for his arrest, the filing says.",
      "Garcia was interviewed and repeatedly asked about gang affiliations but told his wife that he was due to appear before an immigration judge and expected to be released. He then called her from a detention center in Texas, telling her he was about to be deported, the filing says.",
      "Garcia's lawsuit accuses the Department of Homeland Security, ICE and several Cabinet members named as defendants of deciding to deport him without following the law, in full knowledge that \"El Salvador tortures individuals detained in CECOT.\"",
      "\"Upon information and belief, they did so knowing and intending that the Government of El Salvador would detain Plaintiff Abrego Garcia in CECOT immediately upon arrival,\" the lawsuit says.",
      "The government's court filing Monday said members of Garcia's legal team \"have not clearly shown a likelihood that Abrego Garcia will be tortured or killed in CECOT.\"",

      "It says Danny Bennett took advantage of his father\u2019s diminished capacity late in life due to Alzheimer\u2019s disease to make deals to make millions for himself and his company, including the sale shortly before his death of Tony Bennett\u2019s catalog and his name, likeness and image rights to the brand development firm Iconoclast.",

      "Attorneys for Danny Bennett did not immediately respond to an after-hours email seeking comment.",
      "In court filings in the previous lawsuit, his attorneys said the sisters\u2019 claims were baseless, that they had been provided with sufficient accounting, and that Tony Bennett trusted Danny Bennett completely during his life and credited his son with pulling him out of financial troubles and reviving his career.",
      "Danny Bennett was his father\u2019s personal and professional manager with power of attorney, was manager of his company Benedetto Arts, and is the trustee of the family trust, the suit says.",
      "The new lawsuit accuses him of benefiting from \u201cself-interested and conflicted transactions, excessive and unearned commissions,\u201d and \u201csubstantial loans and gifts to himself and his children\u201d that have diminished assets that Tony Bennett\u2019s will calls for his four children to split equally.",

    "summary": "Republicans also got key reinforcements for their slim House majority at an important moment. And Democrats made gains compared to 2024 in each key race.",
    "story": [
      "Tuesday\u2019s elections in Wisconsin and Florida were kind to the favorites but not to billionaire White House adviser Elon Musk. And that result could stick around long after the votes are counted.",
      "State Circuit Judge Susan Crawford won a pivotal election to maintain liberal control of Wisconsin\u2019s Supreme Court despite a big push from Musk and his millions, while two Republican candidates in Florida won special House elections in deep-red districts. But even though their candidates won just one of the three contests on the ballot, it was a good night for Democrats.",
      "They spent heavily to back Crawford, who cruised to victory over Circuit Judge Brad Schimel without much suspense Tuesday night.",
      "And while Republicans will pad their slim House majority in Washington with two more reinforcements at a critical legislative moment, the Democratic candidates significantly improved on the party\u2019s November performance, raising questions about whether Democrats can keep up that momentum in next year\u2019s midterm elections.",
      "Here are the key takeaways from Tuesday\u2019s elections, including what they mean for politics and other campaigns this year and next year.",
      "Democrats have a new boogeyman",
      "Just months after Democrats lost a presidential election while failing to generate strong enough backlash against Donald Trump, it appears they\u2019ve found a new electoral boogeyman in Musk.",
      "Recent polls have shown Musk\u2019s favorability ratings are lower than Trump\u2019s, both in Wisconsin and nationally, so it makes sense that the pro-Crawford campaign would lean in on Musk in their messaging. And lean in they did \u2014 Crawford and Democrats repeatedly evoked him on the stump, and her campaign ran a TV ad accusing him of \u201ctrying to buy Schimel a seat on the Supreme Court.\u201d",
      "Musk went to great lengths to help Schimel. His super PAC spent more than $12.5 million in independent expenditures, Musk donated $3 million to the state Republican Party, his super PAC controversially doled out million-dollar checks to three voters who signed a conservative-leaning petition, he traveled to Wisconsin to campaign in the race\u2019s final days, and he regularly posted about the race on X, his social media platform.",
      "The focus on Musk is especially notable because Democrats seemed to intentionally avoid highlighting Trump\u2019s endorsement of Schimel \u2014 a move strategists in both parties said was coyly designed to avoid overtly juicing turnout among Trump-loving voters in a state he narrowly carried in two of the past three presidential races.",
      "Democrats and groups backing Crawford didn\u2019t mention Trump\u2019s endorsement of Schimel once in TV ads, choosing instead to go all in on villainizing Musk. (Schimel leaned heavily into Trump\u2019s support, running ads in the final 11 days of the campaign that emphasized his ties to Trump.)",
      "Time will tell whether Democrats can replicate the strategy in races in which Musk isn\u2019t personally playing such a major role or whether his utility as a boogeyman diminishes if he eventually steps away from the White House.",
      "And Musk\u2019s potential liabilities need to be taken in full context \u2014 that is, he has shown that his willingness to lend his wealth to politics extends beyond supporting Trump, and his staggering wealth, combined with his unique cult of personality, makes him an important ally for Republicans. Buckle up for an expensive \u2014 and loud \u2014 2026 midterm election, with Musk in the middle.",
      "Republicans\u2019 2024 playbook wasn\u2019t enough in Wisconsin",
      "In the final weeks of the Wisconsin race, Republicans and groups supporting Schimel hammered Crawford with ads over transgender issues (in addition to highlighting endorsements from Trump and Musk).",
      "That move very closely resembled the tack Republicans and Trump used down the homestretch of their successful 2024 campaign against Democrats in Wisconsin and several other swing states.",
      "Each side used ads to paint its opponent as soft on crime, and groups supporting Schimel slammed Crawford in ads over her role in sentencing in specific cases involving convicted sex offenders while they boosted Schimel for his role in delivering tough sentences against criminals.",
      "That strategy closely resembled moves Sen. Ron Johnson and groups supporting him made down the stretch against Democratic challenger Mandela Barnes in the competitive 2022 Senate race in the battleground state.",
      "But Crawford and groups supporting her hit back on crime in ads themselves, in the hope of insulating her from the attacks.",
      "The pro-Trump playbook did work in the two special elections in Florida\u2019s 1st and 6th Congressional Districts to replace GOP former Reps. Michael Waltz, now Trump\u2019s national security adviser, and Matt Gaetz. Republicans worked to energize their base, looking to boost GOP turnout in the ruby-red districts.",
      "Trump held tele-town halls for both Republican candidates, and outside groups launched ads in the final days of the race reminding voters that they had Trump\u2019s support. And Republicans ultimately averted anything resembling a close call in two solid-red districts.",
      "State Chief Financial Officer Jimmy Patronis was projected to win the 1st District race by 15 points, and GOP state Sen. Randy Fine was projected to win by 14 points. But their margins were around half as large as Trump\u2019s in November.",
      "House GOP expands majority",
      "Tuesday\u2019s elections affected more than the world of campaign politics. In Congress, the pair of GOP victories in Florida will give Republican leaders a little more leeway to pass their major priorities, since they will have a 220-213 majority in the House once Fine and Patronis are sworn in.",
      "If every sitting member votes, Republicans can afford to lose three GOP votes and still pass legislation even if all Democrats oppose a measure. (Two Democratic-held seats are vacant.)",
      "Patronis and Fine will head to Congress at a key moment for the GOP, with Republicans trying to piece together a sweeping budget proposal to tackle Trump\u2019s top priorities, including extending his 2017 tax cuts.",
      "Fine has signaled that he will support Trump\u2019s priorities, telling him at last week\u2019s tele-town hall, \u201cI stand behind you 100%, and you\u2019ll have no greater warrior for your agenda than me.\u201d",
      "Patronis is also a Trump ally, though the self-described fiscal conservative told NBC News in January that he could clash with GOP leaders on government spending, saying, \u201cI will not waste people\u2019s money, and I have no problem calling out absurdity.\u201d",
      "Asked in an interview last week whether there were any elements of a possible budget proposal he wouldn\u2019t support, such as cuts to Medicaid, Patronis demurred, saying he hadn\u2019t given much thought to \u201cthose type of hypotheticals.\u201d",
      "\u201cMy principles are making sure that we\u2019re either restoring dollars back to the citizens of CD-1, we spend their dollars more efficient,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s good to create a path where you\u2019re taking away something from a benefit or entitlement that somebody is counting on. I do like giving people options.\u201d",
      "Democrats still have some energy",
      "Trump\u2019s victory in November might have deflated Democrats, but the party showed some signs of life in Tuesday\u2019s elections.",
      "Democrats in the Trump era have swamped Republicans in fundraising, and Tuesday\u2019s races demonstrate that the fundraising boom hasn\u2019t stopped; meanwhile, Democrats continue to enjoy a key advantage on the airwaves.",
      "Crawford\u2019s fundraising helped her outpace Schimel on the airwaves, spending more than $26 million on ads to Schimel\u2019s almost $14 million, according to the ad-tracking firm AdImpact. While GOP outside groups jumped in to help close the gap, Crawford\u2019s advantage is notable because outside groups have to pay higher rates to run ads.",
      "In Florida, Democrats fell short in the deep-red House districts, but they raised millions of dollars in the process. Democrat Josh Weil, a public school teacher, had raked in over $10 million as of Monday, while Fine, his opponent in the 6th District, had raised $2 million, including $600,000 from himself.",
      "In the 1st District, Valimont had raised $6.5 million as of March 12, while Patronis had raised $2.1 million.",
      "Their losses also underscore the limits of seemingly unlimited money, with the well-funded candidates unable to overcome the deeply Republican slants of both districts. But they did cut into that advantage.",
      "Both Weil and Valimont also outperformed Vice President Kamala Harris in November, with Weil\u2019s vote share improving on Harris\u2019 by 8 points and Valimont surpassing Harris\u2019 vote share by 11 points. Crawford also well outperformed Harris on Tuesday night, carrying in the high single digits a state that Harris lost months earlier.",
      "Democrats touted those margins, noting the party has overperformed in several special elections this year for state legislative seats.",
      "Battleground voters tuned in",
      "Wisconsin\u2019s Supreme Court race had a slew of factors all coming to a head Tuesday \u2014 Musk, Trump, tens of millions of dollars in spending, a battle for partisan control of the court \u2014 and what did it all add up to? Record turnout.",
      "Votes are still being counted, but turnout has already eclipsed the 2023 Wisconsin Supreme Court race\u2019s turnout of 1.8 million votes, and both 2025 candidates will end up eclipsing the 2023 candidates\u2019 vote totals. In addition, the number of voters in this year\u2019s contest could approach the number that cast their ballots in the midterm in 2022, when more than 2.6 million people voted in competitive statewide races.",
      "Take Fond du Lac County, where the Republican Party was founded in 1854. This year, more than 39,000 people cast their ballots there, between the 30,000 who voted in the 2023 Supreme Court race and the almost 47,000 who voted for governor in 2022.",
      "In Door County, a swingy county north of Green Bay that has sided with the presidential winner in six of the last seven presidential elections (it failed to do so last year), Tuesday\u2019s turnout of 15,300 trends closer to 2022\u2019s 17,300 than 2023\u2019s 12,300.",
      "Wisconsin already had nearly 2.2 million votes tallied by midnight ET, with a chunk of votes still outstanding, according to the NBC News Decision Desk. If that projection holds, the race will end up just shy of turnout in the 2022 midterms, an impressive mark in one of the most politically engaged states in the country.",
      "Until we get some signs pointing in another direction, don\u2019t expect the consistently high turnout in Trump-era elections to dissipate any time soon."

      "As Democrats celebrate a battleground-state win in the most expensive judicial campaign in U.S. history, President Donald Trump and the GOP are confronting a worrying early sign about what the intense spotlight on Elon Musk\u2019s influence means for the party.",
      "Musk, the billionaire White House adviser, played a starring role in the race, using personal funds and allied outside groups to put more than $15 million behind former Wisconsin Attorney General Brad Schimel, the Trump-endorsed candidate who ran against Madison County Circuit Judge Susan Crawford. Crawford and her allies responded in kind, using Musk as a foil and scoring a decisive win.",
      "Though the race was technically nonpartisan, there were intense partisan overtones \u2014 and it functionally transformed into a proxy vote on Trump\u2019s first two months in office and especially on Musk, who has become one of the most powerful people in Republican politics since Trump won last year.",
      "Yet while the results were not promising in Republicans\u2019 first statewide test of the second Trump administration, Trump advisers are \u2014 at least for now \u2014 brushing off the loss, noting it was an off-year election with lower turnout than the recent presidential race.",
      "\u201cThe results are what they are. It\u2019s an off-year race and predictive of nothing,\u201d a Trump adviser said. \u201cI don\u2019t think you can read too much into it, including Elon\u2019s role.\u201d",
      "A source familiar with Musk\u2019s thinking was on the same page, brushing off the loss as the result of an \u201cuphill battle.\u201d",
      "\u201cElon was a happy warrior this entire race, knowing full well it was an uphill battle. The only reason Schimel was able to make this a race was because Elon got involved,\u201d said the source familiar with Musk\u2019s thinking. \u201cHe put the Democrats on defense and made them empty their coffers in a race that should\u2019ve never been competitive.\u201d",
      "The person added that Musk\u2019s effort to help Republican campaigns will continue.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s going to continue to be active and isn\u2019t ceding anything to Democrats,\u201d the person said.",
      "Even so, on the heels of Schimel\u2019s loss, Republicans are assessing how Musk\u2019s spotlight-stealing influence will shape key political races headed into the midterms in 2026, when Republicans will defend a narrow House majority. While turnout in Wisconsin did not hit presidential levels, it did come close to the number of people who voted in the 2022 midterms in the state \u2014 closer to a regular election than a low-turnout blip.",
      "\u201cElon is great for Trump because he\u2019s a shield,\u201d said a Republican operative who advised Musk on the Wisconsin race. But, the person added, the ability to attract so much heat is \u201cbad for elections, because he energizes the Democrats.\u201d",
      "The recent NBC News poll found a majority of voters nationwide (51%) holding negative views of Musk, while 39% viewed him positively. Neither Musk nor Trump had spoken publicly about the Wisconsin result as of 11 p.m. Tuesday.",
      "The White House\u2019s political arm, including Musk, played an \u201cunprecedented\u201d role in the contest, highlighting the importance of the race to Trump \u2014 and the stinging nature of the loss. Trump endorsed Schimel and publicly hyped the importance of the race, but much of the attention in the weeks leading up to Election Day were squarely focused on Musk, who was Trump\u2019s biggest donor last year and has signaled ambitions to use his massive wealth to influence races in the future.",
      "Beyond giving huge sums of political cash to Schimel, Musk set up a petition contest that made those who signed up to fight \u201cactivist\u201d judges eligible for a $1 million prize, and he also held a rally for Schimel on Sunday. At the rally, Musk said the race could \u201caffect the entire destiny of humanity.\u201d",
      "\u201cI would call it unprecedented,\u201d former Wisconsin GOP chair Andrew Hitt said of the White House\u2019s role in the state race. \u201cNever been done before in terms of their involvement.\u201d",
      "He said that the race was without question viewed through a Trump-Musk lens as it started to gain more national attention but that it was not always just Democrats trying to make that brand stick.",
      "\u201cI think as the race nationalized, I would say in some ways the right defined ourselves as having the Trump-Musk candidate,\u201d Hitt said. \u201cThe left really did not have to do that; it was conservatives who did that.\u201d",
      "Hitt was surprised at how much Crawford was winning by late Tuesday, but he said he did think Musk helped energize grassroots Republicans in the state after he got fully involved.",
      "\u201cHe helped close the gap, I believe,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will see where the margin ultimately lands, but it felt like Elon was energizing people. Maybe not? We will see where the final numbers land.\u201d",
      "Trump beat Vice President Kamala Harris in the state by less than 1 percentage point last year \u2014 the third straight time the presidential race has come down to decimal points in Wisconsin.",
      "\u201cWisconsin is a big state politically, and the Supreme Court has a lot to do with elections in Wisconsin,\u201d Trump said last week. \u201cWinning Wisconsin is a big deal, so therefore the Supreme Court choice ... it\u2019s a big race.\u201d",
      "But Trump supporters focused Tuesday on wins they notched in two Florida congressional seats, which will help ensure Republicans maintain their slim House majority. Democrats made some gains amid low turnout in the deep-red seats, but both GOP candidates still won comfortably.",
      "\u201cDemocrats held Wisconsin\u2019s Supreme Court seat while Republicans won both congressional races in Florida,\u201d a former Trump adviser said. \u201cRepublicans have maintained our majority in the House, and, most importantly, Democrats will not be able to impede on President Donald J. Trump\u2019s America First agenda.\u201d"

      "Susan Crawford has won a seat on the Wisconsin Supreme Court, NBC News projects, allowing liberals to maintain their narrow majority on the battleground state\u2019s highest court \u2014 and defying Elon Musk after he spent millions of dollars to oppose her.",
      "Crawford, a Dane County circuit judge who was backed by Democrats, secured a 10-year term on the court over Brad Schimel, a Waukesha County circuit judge and a former Republican attorney general. As the first major battleground state election of President Donald Trump\u2019s second term, the technically nonpartisan contest drew national attention and became the most expensive state Supreme Court race in U.S. history.",
      "The outcome is a setback for Trump and his billionaire adviser, Musk. Trump endorsed Schimel in the final stretch of the race, while Musk injected himself into the center of it, spending huge sums of money, visiting Wisconsin days out from Election Day and frequently posting about the race on his X feed. In turn, Democrats and progressive groups made Musk their primary villain, attacking his influence on the race and his efforts to slash federal jobs and the government through the Department of Government Efficiency.",
      "\"As a little girl growing up in Chippewa Falls, I never could have imagined that I\u2019d be taking on the richest man in the world for justice in Wisconsin,\" Crawford told supporters Tuesday night. \"And we won.\"",
      "In a brief concession speech, Schimel said, \"I knew I had to put my all in,\" but that \"you gotta accept the results.\"",
      "Crawford\u2019s victory also means liberals will maintain a 4-3 advantage on the court for at least another year heading into a term when it could decide cases about abortion rights, unions and collective bargaining rights, and congressional maps and redistricting.",
      "Despite the more than $15 million that Musk and groups affiliated with him dropped into the race, Democrats overall held a narrow ad spending advantage, according to AdImpact.",
      "Democratic-aligned groups spent millions of dollars blasting Musk as \u201ctrying to buy\u201d Schimel and the election, while Crawford herself repeatedly used Musk as a foil at her campaign events. The Democratic Party of Wisconsin launched a town-hall tour dubbed \u201cPeople v. Musk,\u201d on which surrogates including Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz further bashed Musk and DOGE.",
      "Some also pointed out that Musk\u2019s electric car company, Tesla, sued in Wisconsin this year challenging a state law banning carmakers from owning dealerships. The case could end up before the state Supreme Court.",
      "Democrats also attacked Musk\u2019s offer of $100 to Wisconsin voters to sign a petition to oppose \u201cactivist judges.\u201d The Democratic state attorney general, Josh Kaul, also unsuccessfully tried to block Musk from giving $1 million to people to be \u201cspokesmen\u201d for the petition at a rally Sunday.",
      "Conversely, groups on the left largely stayed away from making the race about Trump, who narrowly carried the state in two of the past three presidential elections.",
      "The anti-Musk playbook is one that Democrats could seek to replicate in other elections this year and in the 2026 midterms.",
      "Schimel embraced Trump in the closing days of the race, a move strategists said was intended to try to juice conservative turnout.",
      "In addition to running ads touting Trump\u2019s endorsement, Schimel appeared at a campaign town hall event in March with Donald Trump Jr. and told a group of canvassers from the conservative group Turning Point USA that Trump needs a \u201csupport network\u201d around him to help him fight the myriad suits his administration has faced.",
      "Each side tried to paint its opponent as soft on crime \u2014 even though the state Supreme Court rarely hears cases about sentencing \u2014 while Crawford also attacked Schimel in ads that focused on allegations that the state Justice Department mishandled the maintenance of thousands of rape kits under his watch as attorney general.",
      "Apart from Musk, groups on the left made Crawford\u2019s support of reproductive rights a central theme in their ads and messaging. Abortion rights and the fate of the state\u2019s 1849 abortion ban were hot topics because of a pair of cases already before the court.",
      "The state Supreme Court heard a challenge to the ban in November and is widely expected to overturn the law, but before Crawford is sworn in in August. Abortion providers in the state resumed the procedure in 2023 after a judge ruled that the 175-year-old law didn\u2019t apply to consensual medical abortions, but the state Supreme Court is reviewing whether to entirely invalidate it.",
      "There is also a separate case in which Planned Parenthood has directly asked the court to establish whether the state constitution established a right to an abortion. The court Crawford will sit on could hear that case.",
      "In addition, the court is also likely to end up ruling on a case challenging landmark legislation during the administration of Republican Gov. Scott Walker that eliminated collective bargaining for most public workers, known as Act 10.",
      "And the court could end up deciding cases challenging the state\u2019s congressional maps, which favor Republicans.",
      "After liberal Justice Janet Protasiewicz joined the court in 2023, it overturned the state\u2019s gerrymandered legislative maps. The court declined last year to hear a suit that sought to redraw the congressional maps.",
      "But many Republicans have expressed fear that similar suits could be accepted in the future, pointing to an email from a Democratic-aligned group that suggested a Crawford victory might \u201cput two more House seats in play.\u201d The topic, as well as that email, became a theme in some of the ads run by Schimel-aligned outside groups.",
      "Liberals won a majority on the Wisconsin Supreme Court for the first time in 15 years in 2023.\u00a0The majority was again on the line this year after liberal Justice Ann Walsh Bradley announced her retirement. State Supreme Court elections are also scheduled in Wisconsin each year from 2026 to 2030.",
      "Further down the Wisconsin ballot",
      "Meanwhile, in the state's nominally nonpartisan school superintendent race, incumbent Jill Underly, who was backed by the state Democratic Party, defeated Brittany Kinser, who had the backing of conservative groups, NBC News projects.",
      "That race was also largely defined by the role Musk has played in downsizing the federal government, and the contest took on increased importance in the weeks since Trump signed an executive order to dismantle the U.S. Education Department.",
      "Wisconsin voters also approved a proposed amendment to enshrine an existing voter ID law into the state constitution, NBC News projects.",
      "The measure will add language to the constitution from a 2011 measure requiring voters to provide photo ID when they vote or request absentee ballots.",

      "Honeybees are the backbone of the food ecosystem, pollinating 75% of the world's natural supplies, according to the\u00a0National Park Service. But a recent nationwide survey\u00a0by Project Apis m., a nonprofit group that supports beekeeping science, found \u201ccatastrophic\u201d honeybee declines across the industry.",
      "Commercial operators reported an average loss of 62% from June to February nationwide.",
      "\u201cThese alarming losses, which surpass historical trends, could significantly impact U.S. agriculture, particularly crop pollination for almonds, fruits, vegetables, and other essential food sources,\u201d the survey said.",
      "Elina L. Ni\u00f1o, who runs the\u00a0Bee Health Hub\u00a0at the University of California, Davis, said researchers have not determined why so many bees have died in the past year.",
      "\"There are many contributing factors that can cause a colony to die,\u201d\u00a0she said, including pathogens; varroa mites, a parasite that feeds on bees; and a lack of nutrition.",
      "\u201cTo put it into perspective \u2014 we, the United States \u2014 we have about 2.7 million colonies. So that\u2019s a huge loss for beekeepers, huge loss for agricultural industry,\" Ni\u00f1o said. \"And of course, when you combine thefts with that, it\u2019s not good news for beekeepers, either.\u201d",
      "Bees are responsible for $17 billion in agricultural production in the United States every year, according to Project Apis m.",
      "\u201cSo if you have a loss of pollinators that are pollinating those crops, prices of food are probably going to go up,\u201d Ni\u00f1o said.",
      "Bees, the only insects that produce food for human consumption, have become a hot commodity as their numbers dwindle.",
      "In Northern California's Butte County, beehive theft revolves around almond pollination, said Sheriff's Deputy Rowdy Freeman, a member of the California Rural Crime Prevention Task Force.",
      "\u201cI often describe it as a perfect crime, because it\u2019s beekeepers stealing from other beekeepers,\u201d he said.",
      "Investigators say most thefts occur at night, so beekeepers are getting creative by hiding tracking devices deep in the hives.",
      "The task force also encourages beekeepers to brand their hives so law enforcement can determine the rightful owner.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s kind of rare that we do recover stolen hives,\u201d Freeman said.",
      "Bee thefts in California have increased 87% since 2013, to 10,000 stolen hives valued at over $3.5 million, according to the task force.",
      "Beekeeper Trevor Tauzer, whose 4 million bees help pollinate a 40-acre almond orchard near Sacramento, California, has had to deal with bee deaths and thefts.",
      "\u201cIt feels violating,\" Tauzer said. \"You work all year, you put all your money, you put all of your effort, all of your passion, into keeping the bees healthy, and then somebody picks up and disappears with them.\u201d",
      "Ni\u00f1o said that beekeepers need government support to counteract the losses but that regular people can also play a role by providing access to clean bee forage.",
      "\u201cIf you have a backyard, we have great resources at UC Davis where you can look up what plants you could plant to support the pollinators,\" Ni\u00f1o said. \u201cResearch has shown over and over again that if the bees do have access to plentiful forage, plentiful flowers, they can deal with a lot of the other negative factors that they have to be exposed to.\u201d"

      "In a 2023 court deposition shown in the documentary, Barnett also said Grace told him she already had a monthly period.",

We got Jack Black this week ... We will be fine.\u201d",

      "In fact, in their early days of courtship, the couple agreed that kids were not in their future. \"Haha, fast forward!\" Heather Rae El Moussa joked.",
      "The reality star said she became interested in the idea of motherhood after her feelings for Tarek El Moussa deepened.",
      "\"We fell in love,\" she explained. \"You know, you have this deep connection with someone and I loved being a stepmom so much. I was so close to the kids. I just wanted to experience it on my own, and have my own, and have my own with him.\"",
      "After welcoming Tristan, motherhood quickly became the focus of Heather Rae El Moussa's life. \"I never wanted to leave (the house),\" she said. \"I want to be with him all the time. I still do.\"",
      "She and her husband began discussing the possibility of welcoming a second child in couple's therapy four months ago. \"I wish we would have started (therapy) sooner because I think it\u2019s such an amazing thing and it helps communication,\u201d Heather Rae El Moussa said.",
      "Though her husband has pointed out to her that he\u2019s been \u201craising babies\u201d since he was in his 20s, Heather Rae El Moussa said she feels as though her journey into motherhood has only just begun.",
      "\u201cMe, I\u2019m like, \u2018But I just started,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s kind of where we\u2019re at. But we\u2019re talking through it.\u201d",
      "She also revealed that if she does become a mom again, she'd prefer to do it sooner rather than later.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m 37. I\u2019m turning 38 this year. So, for me, it\u2019s kind of like now or never in a way, not because you can\u2019t have babies older, but I don\u2019t want to be 40 having babies still because it\u2019s a lot,\u201d she said",
      "\u201cIt takes up a lot of your time, a lot of your life and the kids are my priority over myself. So, I want to do it, get my body back. And it took a long time. It\u2019s hard,\u201d she added."

    "summary": "What is the true story of the Netflix documentary \"Con Mum\"? About Graham Hornigold, his mom Dionne, where hthey are now and more.",
    "story": [
      "The Netflix documentary \u201cCon Mum\u201d is the story of one man\u2019s dream-turned-nightmare. Graham Hornigold, a London-based pastry chef, grew up fantasizing about his birth mother. Then in 2020, he says in the documentary, a woman reached out saying she was the mother he never knew.",
      "She said that she \u201cnever stopped loving\u201d Hornigold, he says in the documentary. After a series of specific questions, Hornigold says he was convinced the woman knew enough details about his life to be his mother.",
      "So, Hornigold and his pregnant wife, Heather Kaniuk, also a pastry chef, went to meet her. What came next is the story of \u201cCon Mum.\u201d",
      "\u201cYou believe she is who she says she is. But she is a destroyer of lives,\u201d Hornigold says in the documentary.",
      "The rest of the documentary follows Hornigold's story, and how he says the woman claiming to be his long-lost mother conned him out of hundreds of thousands of dollars.",
      "The woman claimed she was dying of cancer and wanted to leave her vast fortune to Hornigold, he says in the documentary. Swept up into her world, Hornigold became closer to the woman, ultimately staying with her when his wife and newborn went to New Zealand and helping her pay bills.",
      "Eventually, Hornigold says in the documentary, he awakened to the woman's con. By then, he had given her money \u2014 a total of \u00a3300,000, he says in the documentary \u2014 and his marriage had ended.",
      "The devastating final twist? A DNA test shown at the end of the documentary concludes that the woman was indeed Hornigold\u2019s biological mother.",
      "How did 'Con Mum' happen?",
      "In an interview with TODAY.com, clinical psychologist Natalie Feinblatt, who specializes in trauma recovery for people who\u2019ve left high-control groups and cults, says \u201canyone\u201d is susceptible to scams \u2014 but Hornigold\u2019s origin story left him particularly vulnerable.",
      "Raised by a stepmother and father to whom he is no longer close, Hornigold says he often wondered about his mother growing up. \u201cIt\u2019s quite painful, not knowing your mother. You haven\u2019t got your mum,\u201d he says in the documentary.",
      "\u201cReuniting with a lost parent taps into deep psychological needs for connection and origin,\" Feinblatt says. \"For someone who may already carry questions about identity or belonging, the desire to believe the story can override red flags. Scammers often exploit that window of vulnerability \u2014 not because the victim is naive or foolish, but because they\u2019re human.\u201d",
      "In Hornigold\u2019s case, Feinblatt says the con struck at the the \u201ccore\u201d of his attachment system, an insight he echoes in the documentary.",
      "\u201cThe realization kicks in that this woman is not who she says she is. Because of a cellular level need for acceptance and for a mother, I have been played,\u201d Hornigold says in the documentary.",
      "Dorcy Pruter, a therapist who specializes in parental reunification, tells TODAY.com the maternal connection likely blinded Hornigold to seeing the situation clearly.",
      "\"When someone comes along offering that relief, even if it\u2019s wrapped in red flags, the heart can override the brain.\"",
      "Dorcy Pruter",
      "\u201cPeople with unresolved childhood trauma or identity wounds are especially susceptible because they\u2019re not just looking for answers \u2014 they\u2019re looking for relief. And when someone comes along offering that relief, even if it\u2019s wrapped in red flags, the heart can override the brain,\u201d Pruter says.",
      "For any victim of a scam, Feinblatt emphasizes the healing process can take a long time, because it requires \u201crebuilding a sense of safety and reality\u201d beyond just recovering what has been lost.",
      "Betrayal is accompanied by symptoms like anxiety, depression, hypervigilance and a sense of shame, coupled with the inability to trust instincts.",
      "\u201cPeople often describe feeling like the ground has dropped out from under them \u2014 confused, destabilized, and unsure who they can turn to,\u201d Feinblatt says.",
      "She sees value in documentaries like \u201cCon Mum,\u201d which show ordinary people being conned.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s this myth that \u2018only gullible people get scammed,\u2019 when in reality, scams are often sophisticated, targeted and deeply emotional. Seeing real people go through these experiences helps normalize the pain of betrayal and shows that it can happen to anyone,\u201d she says.",
      "\u201cAnybody can fall prey to this at the wrong place, at the wrong time. It just has to hit you in your in your vulnerable spot \u2014 and you\u2019re in,\u201d she continues. \u201cA lot of people don\u2019t like to look at it. It\u2019s scary to consider.\u2019"

      "Here's a full rundown of who's who in the Blueyverse.",
      "Bluey",
      "As the title character, Bluey is a seemingly inexhaustible font of energy. She starts off the series as a 6-year-old and then turns 7 in the \"Pass the Parcel\" episode.",
      "She's generally a caring big sister to Bingo and she loves any game that involves role play. (Her stint as Granny Janet is particularly entertaining.)",

      "In typical dad fashion, he loves sports, barbecues and horseplay. But he's also willing to sit and empathize with his daughters, adjusting his behavior to be more sensitive when needed.",
      "Mum (Chilli)",
      "Chilli really breaks down the mom stereotype of always being the patient nurturer. In many episodes, Chilli appears to be short-tempered or frustrated with her kids, and she teaches them that moms sometimes need a time out, just like kids do.",
      "\"I need 20 minutes where no one comes near me,\" Chilli once told her husband as soon as he came home from work.",
      "She also teaches her daughters how to throw a stick, she fixes the broken toilet, she plays field hockey and she works as a \"sniffer\" dog in airport security.",

      "The show suggests that Brandy struggled with infertility and had to distance herself from Chilli's family as a result. In \"The Sign,\" however, we see the sisters reunite ... and Brandy is pregnant!",
      "Calypso",
      "Calypso is Bluey's teacher. She is remarkably calm, fair and patient \u2014 and she's very good at knitting.",
      "Chloe",
      "Chloe is one of Bluey's best friends, and she's a total pro at the monkey bars. Her favorite TV show is \"Chutney Chimp.\"",
      "Coco",
      "Coco and Bluey have known each other since they were babies \u2014 their mums used to bring them to the same infant class. Coco is the youngest of nine and her mom helped Chilli learn that babies hit milestones in their own time.",

    "story": [
      "The Season 2 finale of \"Survival of the Thickest\" delivers an emotional conclusion to a season filled with humor, self-discovery, and, of course, the bold fashion choices that the show is known for.",
      "Michelle Buteau\u2019s character, Mavis Beaumont, ends the season with a moment of personal growth and professional triumph, cementing the show\u2019s commitment to exploring themes of inclusivity, second chances and the importance of chosen family.",
      "In the final episode, Mavis takes a stand against a fashion designer who, despite claiming to be inclusive, fails to truly cater to plus-size women. Her protest against this designer quickly goes viral, leading to a tense and public fallout. The situation escalates when Mavis is invited to a podcast interview, but instead of using the opportunity to clarify her stance, the interview exacerbates the conflict. It leaves Mavis with a tarnished reputation and a career in jeopardy.",
      "But Mavis doesn\u2019t back down. She takes matters into her own hands, collaborating with the designer to create a groundbreaking fashion show. This show not only features plus-size women but also celebrates the inclusion of trans women and individuals of all body types. It\u2019s a defining moment in Mavis\u2019 career, symbolizing her personal commitment to fighting for authentic representation in the fashion industry.",
      "\u201cThis moment in the finale feels like a culmination of everything Mavis has been working for,\u201d Buteau tells TODAY.com. \u201cInclusivity isn\u2019t just about ticking boxes; it\u2019s about creating spaces where everyone can truly see themselves.\u201d",
      "As Mavis works through her professional turmoil, she also grapples with unresolved feelings for her ex, Luca (Marouane Zotti). Their brief reunion in the finale provides a bittersweet moment, filled with uncertainty. Their exchange leaves viewers questioning whether this is the start of something new or simply a nostalgic revisit to the past.",
      "\u201cMavis has come a long way in learning to love herself first,\u201d Buteau says. \u201cNow, the question is \u2014 can she share that love with someone else without losing the growth she\u2019s made?\u201d",
      "Throughout the season, Mavis relies heavily on her chosen family \u2014her friends \u2014 who provide support, wisdom, and humor during some of her most trying times. This concept of chosen family is a central theme of the finale and serves as a reminder that relationships, whether biological or not, can be just as meaningful and life-changing.",
      "As the season closes, fans are left with lingering questions about Mavis\u2019 future. Will her reconciliation with Luca lead to something more? Will her newfound business ventures thrive? And how will her personal life evolve in the wake of her career\u2019s growth?",
      "For now, though, the season finale cements the show's messages of self-love, authenticity and inclusivity. Whether in fashion, friendship, or love, \"Survival of the Thickest\" argues the key to success is staying true to yourself and the people who support you.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re all on our own journeys,\u201d Buteau says. \u201cBut at the end of the day, the love we give to ourselves \u2014 and the people we surround ourselves with \u2014 defines everything.\u201d"

What\u2019s happening in society where a boy stabs a girl to death? What\u2019s the inciting incident here?\u2019 And then it happened again, and it happened again, and it happened again.

      "The evacuation orders appeared to cover nearly all of the city and nearby areas. The military ordered Palestinians to head to Muwasi, a sprawl of squalid tent camps along the coast. The orders came during\u00a0Eid al-Fitr, a normally festive Muslim holiday\u00a0marking the end of the fasting month of Ramadan.",
      "The order came after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu repeated a demand on Sunday for Hamas to disarm and for its leaders to leave Gaza as he promised to\u00a0step up pressure\u00a0on the group\u00a0while continuing\u00a0efforts\u00a0to\u00a0return\u00a0hostages.",

      "Senior\u00a0Hamas official Sami Abu Zuhri said Netanyahu\u2019s comments were a recipe for \u201cendless escalation\u201d in the region.",
      "Netanyahu rejected assertions that Israel, which has resumed its\u00a0bombardment of Gaza\u00a0after a two-month truce and sent troops back into the enclave, was not negotiating, saying \u201cwe are conducting it under fire, and therefore it is also effective\u201d.",
      "\u201cWe see that there are suddenly cracks,\u201d he said in a video statement issued on Sunday.",
      "On Saturday,\u00a0Khalil al-Hayya, the Hamas leader in Gaza, said the group\u00a0had agreed to a\u00a0proposal\u00a0that security sources said included the release of five Israeli hostages each week.\u00a0But he said\u00a0laying down its arms as Israel has demanded\u00a0was a \u201cred line\u201d the group would not cross.",
      "On Sunday, the first day of the Muslim Eid al-Fitr holiday, health authorities in Gaza said at least 24 people, including several children, had been killed in Israeli strikes. Nine were killed in a single tent in the southern city of Khan\u00a0Younis, they said.",

      "It said it had recovered 13 bodies from the scene, seven of them were Palestinian Red Crescent members, another five were from the Gaza Civil Emergency Service, and another was a United Nations worker. There was no immediate Israeli comment.",
      "Since Israel resumed its attacks in Gaza on March 18, hundreds of Palestinians have been killed and tens of thousands have been forced to evacuate areas in northern Gaza where they had returned following the ceasefire agreement in January.",
      "Netanyahu said Israel was demanding that Hamas lay down its arms and said its leaders would be allowed to leave Gaza. He gave no detail on how long Israeli troops would remain in the enclave but repeated that Hamas\u2019s\u00a0military and government capacities must be crushed.",
      "\u201cWe will ensure general security in the Gaza Strip and enable the implementation of the Trump plan, the voluntary emigration plan,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is the plan, we do not hide it, we are ready to discuss it at any time.\u201d",
      "Trump originally proposed moving the entire 2.3 million population of Gaza to countries including Egypt and Jordan and developing the Gaza Strip as a U.S.-owned\u00a0resort. However, no country has agreed to take in the population and Israel has since said that any departures by Palestinians would be voluntary.",
      "Israel launched its campaign in Gaza after a devastating Hamas attack on Israeli communities around the Gaza Strip on Oct. 7, 2023, that killed 1,200 people, according to an Israeli tally, and saw 251 abducted as hostages.",
      "The Israeli campaign has killed more than 50,000 Palestinians, according to Palestinian health authorities, and devastated much of the coastal enclave,\u00a0leaving hundreds of thousands of people in tents and makeshift shelters.",

      "\u201cWe are here to celebrate the rituals of God amid the destruction and the sounds of cannons,\u201d said Minnatallah Al-Far, in Jabalia, in northern Gaza, where most of the area has been laid waste by Israeli bombardment.",
      "\u201cIn Gaza, our situation is very difficult. Other people are celebrating these rituals in peace and safety, but we do them amid destruction and bombardment,\u201d she said.",
      "In Israel, Netanyahu has faced a wave of demonstrations since the military resumed its action in Gaza, with families and supporters of the remaining 59 hostages joining forces with\u00a0protesters\u00a0angry at government actions they see as undermining Israeli democracy.",
      "On Sunday, he rejected what he described as \u201cempty claims and slogans\u201d and said military pressure was the only thing that had returned hostages."

      "Earlier this month, a Lebanese doctor working at Brown University's medical center was sent home despite having a valid U.S. visa after U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents searching her phone found photos and videos they said were \u201csympathetic\u201d to the former leader of the Hezbollah militant group, whose funeral she told agents she attended last month.",

      "Such searches are not new to travelers from parts of the world who already face stringent visa requirements \u2014 Chinese students arriving in the U.S., for example, have complained in recent years of being increasingly subject to interrogation and detention on national security grounds.",
      "But many of the cases in recent weeks have involved travelers from countries such as France, Germany and Canada \u2014 longtime allies with which the U.S. shares intelligence, has frequent cultural exchanges and does hundreds of billions of dollars in trade. Several of those held have spoken out about being scrutinized and sometimes locked up for days at the border.",
      "Last week, France\u2019s interior minister said a French researcher had been turned away by U.S. border agents after they found messages on his phone criticizing the Trump administration. The CBP said searches of the researcher's electronic media devices \u2014 they have not been named by the French authorities \u2014 led to the \u201cdiscovery of proprietary information\u201d from a U.S. laboratory.",
      "CBP does not need a warrant to search the phones of any travelers arriving at the U.S. border, including airports, said Saira Hussain, a senior staff attorney at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a nonprofit digital rights group based in San Francisco.",

      "Jasmine Mooney, a Canadian woman who was reapplying for a U.S. work visa, was detained without explanation on March 3 at the Mexican border near San Diego and spent 12 days in detention before returning home.

      "Burke's family said it believes her detention was due to a misunderstanding about her accommodation arrangements, which were free in exchange for helping hosts with household chores and which her father says authorities may have suspected constituted employment in violation of her visa.",
      "And U.S. citizen Lennon Tyler said she was chained to a bench by border agents last month when her German fianc\u00e9, Lucas Sielaff, was accused of violating the rules of his 90-day U.S. tourist permit while trying to enter from Mexico. Sielaff was detained for two weeks before returning to Germany, according to The Associated Press.",

      "LONDON \u2014 The second Trump administration may have ruffled the feathers of America\u2019s allies, but there is also evidence it has boosted world leaders scrambling to deal with the White House\u2019s norm-busting approach.",
      "Some have gained plaudits for meeting Trump head-on, while others have taken a more nuanced line between flattering the president and trying to shore up their own interests against the headwinds blowing from Washington.",
      "Canada\u2019s Mark Carney is poised to win next month\u2019s election by volubly rejecting President Donald Trump\u2019s hostile advances to make his country the 51st state. On the flip side, Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum has earned accolades for becoming something of a Trump whisperer, deftly responding to his tariff threats and seeing her own popularity rise accordingly.",
      "In Europe, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer and French President Emmanuel Macron have received polling boosts following their widely praised Trump strategies. And the embattled Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has seen his numbers rise as he has tried to cope with Washington\u2019s brusque approach.",
      "\u201cThe standing of politicians who are having to deal with the crisis engendered by Trump\u2019s presidency is leading to a rise in their popularity, if they seem to be doing this in a reasoned and proper way,\u201d said Dominic Grieve, the former British attorney general and an ex-senior lawmaker for the Conservative Party.",
      "To be clear, Trump is no panacea for leaders. Macron and Starmer are still relatively unpopular and face harsh criticisms on domestic issues that will likely decide future elections. Likewise, good polling numbers will be of limited cheer for Zelenskyy while the future of his entire country is in doubt.",
      "Other analysts debate the extent to which this popularity boost is solely because of Trump, rather than the general climate of global instability and uncertainty of which Washington is a part.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not sure so how much it\u2019s a Trump bounce or more of a international crisis bounce,\u201d said Anand Menon, director of the think tank U.K. in a Changing Europe. \u201cInsecurity means that, initially at least, trust in the government goes up.\u201d",
      "Still, the abrupt change of tone and policy from the White House is an undeniable factor.",
      "Trump\u2019s attacks on Canada have seen a remarkable turnaround for Carney\u2019s Liberals. They were headed for historic losses, but Trump\u2019s onslaught has seen them ride a wave of renewed Canadian nationalism and lead the polls at 45% ahead of April 28\u2019s election.",
      "\u201cThe old relationship we had with the United States,\u201d Carney told a news conference Thursday, \u201cis over.\u201d",
      "Mexico\u2019s Sheinbaum has chosen a different tack, taking action on immigration and fentanyl trafficking \u2014 including sending 10,000 National Guard troops to the border. That earned a delay on Trump\u2019s tariffs, as well as praise from the U.S. president, who called her \u201ca wonderful woman.\u201d",
      "At home, she has mixed this strategy with a cerebral nationalism, telling voters that this is about \u201ccoordination, yes \u2014 submission, never.\u201d",
      "Her already high ratings have risen to 85%, according to the El Financiero newspaper in February.",
      "In the United Kingdom, Starmer\u2019s ratings have gone up 8.5 percentage points from February, according to the British pollster Ipsos. That followed an Oval Office meeting with Trump in which he mixed compliments with candor: talking up a potential trade deal while refusing to budge from a commitment to Ukraine.",
      "He has promised to hike British defense spending to 2.5% of GDP by 2027, part of the wider nervousness in Europe about Trump\u2019s commitment to the trans-Atlantic alliance.",
      "The economy and health care will likely decide the next election. But defense is now the third most important issue for British voters, most polls show. And it is defense and international trade on which voters think Starmer is performing best, according to the Ipsos poll taken between March 14 and 17.",
      "\u201cPretty much all of his readings have become somewhat less unpopular in the wake of his trip to Washington,\u201d said John Curtice, one of Britain\u2019s most respected polling experts and a professor at Scotland\u2019s University of Strathclyde. \u201cI think it\u2019s fair to say the public have noticed that he\u2019s risen to the challenge.\u201d",
      "Another man banging the drum on European defense is France\u2019s Macron. He and Starmer are leading an informal \u201ccoalition of the willing\u201d \u2014 a group of countries prepared to send troops to Ukraine to uphold any eventual ceasefire.",
      "Likewise, the current international upheaval has seen Macron\u2019s popularity jump to 31% in March, up 7 points from the previous month, according to an Ifop poll.",
      "These numbers are still relatively low, however, and they may well be fleeting. Macron can\u2019t run again in the next election, in 2027, but his centrist heirs risk losing the presidency to the far-right National Rally, the current favorite.",
      "The same is true for Starmer, whose Labour Party has slid from a landslide victory last year to near parity with the Conservatives and hard-right Reform U.K. Most voters are worried about high prices for food, energy and housing, rather than their leader\u2019s Oval Office repartee.",
      "For any leader enjoying a momentary upside, Menon, of U.K. in a Changing Europe, has a word of warning: \u201cI wouldn\u2019t get complacent on the back of the fact that, right at the moment, things are looking a little bit better because Trump uncertainty.\u201d"

      "But in court papers filed Monday, the government admitted that \"on March 15, although ICE was aware of his protection from removal to El Salvador, Abrego Garcia was removed to El Salvador because of an administrative error.\"",
      "Abrego Garcia lives in Maryland with his wife and 5-year-old child, who is autistic and intellectually disabled. The couple both work full-time, the filing says. NBC Washington first reported the deportation, and The Atlantic first reported the \"administrative error.\"",
      "Garcia\u2019s deportation comes as The Trump administration continues to deport hundreds of people to El Salvador, many of them from Venezuela and almost all bound for the maximum-security Terrorist Confinement Center, known by its Spanish acronym CECOT.",
      "The deportation appears to coincide with the departure of three planeloads of people to El Salvador on March 15. Lawyers for some of those who were deported said they were falsely accused of gang affiliations because of their tattoos.",
      "Garcia, his wife, Jennifer Vasquez Sura, and their legal team filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court in Maryland last week calling for Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem to ensure his return to the United States and for the government to stop paying El Salvador to keep him in prison.",

The men were kneeling, their faces obscured \u2014 but she said she spotted his tattoos and two scars on his head.",
      "The government, however, alleges that Garcia was an \"active member of the criminal gang MS-13,\" citing an unidentified informant at a 2019 bond hearing.",
      "Garcia's lawyers strenuously deny that and claim the government \"has never produced an iota of evidence to support this unfounded allegation.\" Garcia left El Salvador to escape gang violence, his lawyers say, after gangsters threatened to kill him in an attempt to extort his parents.",
      "Vice President JD Vance weighed into the case and falsely said Tuesday on X that Garcia was a \"convicted MS-13 gang member.\" Garcia has no criminal convictions in the United States or in El Salvador, his legal team said in the lawsuit.",
      "In a follow-up post Tuesday, Vance stood by his comments and called Garcia \"an illegal immigrant with no right to be in our country,\" despite the 2019 protection order against his removal from the country.",
      "\"We disagree that he is an MS-13 gang member.\u00a0The only basis of his gang membership was a confidential informant, there was never any hard and fast proof,\" Garcia\u2019s attorney, Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg, said in a statement to NBC News in response to Vance\u2019s posts.",
      "\"There is a judicial process.\u00a0They could have gone back to the judge who, in 2019, gave him an order of protection and could have asked that judge to lift that order.\u00a0They didn\u2019t do that, they just put him on an airplane,\" Sandoval-Moshenberg added.",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt also addressed the case Tuesday, reiterating the claim that he was a member of MS-13.",
      "On March 12, after he finished his shift as a sheet metal worker and picked up his child, Garcia was pulled over and arrested by Homeland Security agents, one of whom told him his \"status has changed,\" says a lawsuit calling for his release from last week.",
      "Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers told him that his wife had to collect the couple's child within 10 minutes or he would be handed over to Child Protective Services, the filing alleges.",
      "She arrived and found Garcia \"confused, distraught and crying,\" but she got no explanation for his arrest, the filing says.",
      "Garcia was interviewed and repeatedly asked about gang affiliations but told his wife that he was due to appear before an immigration judge and expected to be released. He then called her from a detention center in Texas, telling her he was about to be deported, the filing says.",
      "Garcia's lawsuit accuses the Department of Homeland Security, ICE and several Cabinet members named as defendants of deciding to deport him without following the law, in full knowledge that \"El Salvador tortures individuals detained in CECOT.\"",
      "\"Upon information and belief, they did so knowing and intending that the Government of El Salvador would detain Plaintiff Abrego Garcia in CECOT immediately upon arrival,\" the lawsuit says.",
      "The government's court filing Monday said members of Garcia's legal team \"have not clearly shown a likelihood that Abrego Garcia will be tortured or killed in CECOT.\"",
      "The human rights organization Cristosal reported last year that at least 261 people have died in Salvadoran prisons since 2022, while Human Rights Watch,\u00a0Amnesty International\u00a0and other groups have documented extreme crowding and torture at Salvadoran prisons, including CECOT.",

      "\"Whether he is in El Salvador or a detention facility in the U.S., he should be locked up,\" the spokesperson added. \"Remarkable that The Atlantic and other MSM continue to do the bidding of these vicious gangs and ignore their victims.\"",

      "According to a Cyprus News Agency report issued late Monday that cited a criminal court announcement, the court found during closed-door proceedings that most of the contradictions in the woman\u2019s testimony concerned the identification of the perpetrators.",
      "The court said the woman\u2019s initial statement to investigators following the Sept. 3, 2023, alleged rape presented a number of \u201cweaknesses,\u201d which under the circumstances weren\u2019t \u201cout of the ordinary.\u201d",

      "The court said the woman \u2014 who was 20 at the time of the alleged rape \u2014 was under the influence of a \u201csignificant\u201d amount of alcohol and the hallucinogens MDA and MDMA, popularly known as \u201cSally\u201d and \u201cMolly.\u201d",

      "All five of the Israeli men \u2014 then ages 19 and 20 \u2014 had pleaded not guilty to all the charges.",

      "Tensions rose further after Vice President JD Vance suggested that Greenlanders would be better off being under the protection of the U.S. than under Denmark in a speech Friday to American service members at the Pituffik Space Base in the island\u2019s northwest.",
      "Denmark controlled Greenland for 300 years before it became a formal territory in 1953. Greenland gained home rule in 1979, although Copenhagen still controls its foreign and defense policy and contributes just under $1 billion to its economy.",
      "People started to boycott American products after Trump\u2019s inauguration, according to a March 1 survey by the market research firm Megafon for the Danish TV2 show. It found that every second Dane had refrained from buying American goods since then. And 1 in 5 also said they were less likely to visit the U.S.",
      "Elon Musk\u2019s Tesla appears to have been one of the companies hit. Sales of the company\u2019s vehicles in Denmark were down by almost half compared with last year, according to auto industry experts Bilstatistik.dk. As has been the case in other countries, some Danish Tesla owners have adorned their vehicles with stickers saying, \u201cNot a Elon Musk supporter.\u201d",
      "Tesla did not immediately respond to NBC News\u2019 request for comment. NBC News has also reached out to Netflix and Coca-Cola.",
      "Others are switching out more basic items such as canned goods, cola drinks and potato chips, while some stores have started to highlight where their products originate from.",
      "Spar convenience store chain locations have marked items produced in Denmark with the country\u2019s flag, and the supermarket chain Salling group, which has 1,700 stores dotted around the country, has marked products with a star if they originate in Europe.",
      "Stressing that the stars were not a call for consumers to boycott American goods, Henrik Vinther Olesen, the Salling Group\u2019s director of communication, said in an email Saturday that the stars were aimed at providing consumers with information about the origins of their products.",
      "\u201cWe are generally experiencing that customers shop like they usually do,\u201d he added.",
      "Two Danes, Henning Madsen and Ian Rosenfeldt, have also developed the \u201cMade O\u00b4meter\u201d app which allows people to take photos of the goods they are buying so they can find out where the product originated from. However, it is currently paused because it labeled American goods as European.",
      "Consumers like Peter Kolby were also thinking longer term, particularly when it came to the tech they are using.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t have a problem with American goods as such,\u201d he said in a telephone interview Monday. But the 31-year-old from the island of Fyn said he asked himself what he would do if \u201cTrump closed all American tech down for us overnight?\u201d",
      "\u201cWhen I hear this talk about Greenland, then I have to find alternatives to gmail, cloud, IOS, Microsoft,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cWe have to be able to stand on our feet, as Trump has said. And that is what we are doing.\u201d"

      "\u201cWe have shared our problems with them, stating that unilaterally expelling refugees is neither in their interest nor ours,\u201d Haqqani said. \u201cIt is not in their interest because expelling them in this way raises hatred against Pakistan.",

    "story": [
      "BANGKOK \u2014 Chinese rescuers have freed six people from the rubble of an earthquake in Myanmar, including a child and a pregnant woman, Chinese state media reported Monday, placing Beijing at the forefront of an international rescue effort from which the United States has been largely absent.",
      "Rescue teams from India, Malaysia, Russia, Thailand and other countries have already arrived in Myanmar, where the military-led government says the death toll from a 7.7-magnitude earthquake Friday has surpassed 2,000, a figure that is expected to rise.",
      "But a U.S. team has yet to appear at the scene of the quake in the Southeast Asian nation, which occurred the same day the State Department informed thousands of employees of the U.S. Agency for International Development, which administers civilian foreign aid, that nearly all of their roles were being eliminated.",
      "Critics have warned that President Donald Trump\u2019s cuts to U.S. foreign aid, which had previously accounted for less than 1% of the annual federal budget, could create an opening for authoritarian governments such as China and Russia that are trying to increase their global influence.",
      "The U.S. Embassy in Myanmar, one of the world\u2019s poorest countries, said Sunday in a post on X that the U.S. would provide up to $2 million in aid through Myanmar-based humanitarian assistance organizations.",
      "The embassy also said that a USAID emergency response team was \u201cdeploying to Myanmar to identify the people\u2019s most pressing needs, including emergency shelter, food, medical needs, and access to water.\u201d",
      "It was not immediately clear when the U.S. team would arrive in Myanmar, even as the country Monday marked the end of the crucial 72 hours since the quake after which the survival rate of people trapped in the rubble sharply decreases.",
      "The State Department said Monday that in the meantime, U.S. disaster experts in Bangkok, Manila and Washington are monitoring the situation in coordination with U.S. government counterparts in the region.",
      "\u201cI would reject the premise that the sign of success is that we are physically there,\u201d spokesperson Tammy Bruce said.",
      "The U.S. absence is being felt on the ground in Myanmar, a country of 54 million people that, in addition to the earthquake, has been embroiled in a civil war for four years.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve seen a broad cut in humanitarian aid, that\u2019s undeniable,\u201d Trevor Clark, UNICEF\u2019s regional chief of emergency, told NBC News in Bangkok on Monday. \u201cWhat we\u2019re focused on right now is just the immediate stuff. We\u2019ve been able to mobilize some internal resources, and we\u2019re confident that other sort of partners will step up.\u201d",
      "China has announced $14 million in assistance for Myanmar, including 1,200 tents, 8,000 blankets and 40,000 first aid kits. A team of 118 Chinese rescuers arrived in the country Sunday along with six rescue dogs and two vehicles, according to Xinhua, China\u2019s state-run news agency, in addition to 82 who arrived Saturday.",
      "Video from the state-run broadcaster CCTV showed two Chinese rescuers pulling a 5-year-old girl from the rubble of a collapsed apartment building early Monday in Mandalay, Myanmar\u2019s second-largest city, which was near the epicenter of the quake.",
      "The girl was carried down in the claw of an excavator, while a pregnant woman rescued from the same building was carried out on a gurney hooked to a zipline, video from Xinhua showed.",
      "Russia, meanwhile, has sent 20 rescuers, including dog handlers and drone operators, according to the Russian state news agency Tass, as well as three planes including an airmobile hospital.",
      "The international response to the earthquake is complicated by the civil war, with the delivery of aid hampered by \u201cdamaged roads, collapsed bridges, unstable communications, and the complexities related to civil conflict,\u201d the World Health Organization said Sunday.",
      "Myanmar\u2019s military government, which seized power in a 2021 coup, tightly controls access to the country and has continued bombing rebel forces in the days since the quake even as the country is rattled by aftershocks. But it has also sought international help, inviting \u201cany country\u201d to provide assistance.",
      "Thailand has sent a team to neighboring Myanmar even as it deals with its own casualties from the quake, which sent high-rises swaying in the Thai capital, Bangkok, hundreds of miles from the epicenter.",
      "Rescue efforts in Bangkok are centered on a 30-story building under construction that collapsed in the quake, trapping scores of workers.",
      "On Monday, rescuers recovered a 12th body from the wreckage of the building, out of the 19 people killed across the city. Nine people have been found alive while more than 70 others are still missing at the site of the building, where U.S. service members are working alongside the Thai military and other first responders.",
      "Even as rescue efforts continued for a fourth day, officials did not give up hope of finding more survivors. On Monday, Bangkok Deputy Gov. Tavida Kamolvej\u00a0said life-detection equipment had found a weak vital sign under the rubble, prompting Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra to leave the scene so rescuers could hear better.",
      "\u201cEvery second counts, it really counts,\u201d Tavida said.",
