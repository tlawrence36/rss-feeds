      "Taylor Swift is very likely not aware of it, but she\u2019s considered a good luck charm for the Brazilian soccer team hosting Friday\u2019s game between the Kansas City Chiefs and Los Angeles Chargers",
      "SAO PAULO -- Taylor Swift is very likely not aware of it, but she's considered a good luck charm for the Brazilian soccer team hosting Friday's game between the Kansas City Chiefs and Los Angeles Chargers.",
      "The unlikely connection between the pop superstar \u2014 whose fianc\u00e9 is Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce \u2014 and one of the most popular clubs in soccer-mad Brazil lies in the release date of her albums dating to 2006. Corinthians has gone unbeaten in all but one game played right before each album release since then and all but one right after.",
      "It all started as a joke about five years ago, but it has developed into a superstition for local fans.",
      "Until last year, Corinthians won 13 matches and drew seven in such instances. Some were against bitter rival Palmeiras and Brazilian social media was flooded with memes and montages of Swift wearing black and white \u2014 Corinthians' colors.",
      "Many Corinthians fans could have tossed their expectations after their team lost both the match prior to the release of \u201cThe Tortured Poets Department\u201d and the one following. But the NFL game in Sao Paulo, which could draw Swift to NeoQuimica Arena, has kept the Swiftie vibe alive among many local supporters.",
      "\u201cI laughed at first, but there\u2019s more coincidences. Taylor\u2019s first contract was signed on Sept. 1, that\u2019s the same day Corinthians was founded in 1910,\u201d said Rebeca Gois, 32, a marketing writer who lives near the stadium and is a Swift fan. \u201cIt has become a thing. Whenever there\u2019s a new album, we have a double joy; new Taylor songs and Corinthians unbeaten before and after that.\u201d",
      "That long run has encouraged Corinthians fans to think of the singer as an honorary supporter. Some have worn Swift costumes during games.",
      "Gavioes da Fiel, a Corinthians-linked samba school that parades in Sao Paulo's Carnival, jokingly invited Swift to join them in the festivities in 2022.",
      "Swift was in Brazil in 2012 to promote her album \u201cRed\u201d and then in 2023 with six concerts in Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo during the Eras Tour. She has yet to appear at Corinthians stadium.",
      "Nataly Nascimento, a hardcore Corinthians Swiftie, said the trend got a boost after Swift had all her three concerts in Sao Paulo at the Allianz Parque, the stadium of their archrival Palmeiras.",
      "\u201cPeople started to look for that connection to tease Palmeiras fans. And then Corinthians fans started finding those links,\u201d said Nascimento, a 25-year-old teacher who lives in Brazil's Northeast and won't attend. \u201cBut there's something bigger. In the same way that Corinthians fans are much more passionate about their club, Swifties feel that about Taylor. It is mystical.\u201d",

      "Swift's next album, \u201cThe Life of a Show Girl,\u201d will be released on Oct. 3. Corinthians, currently lagging in the 12th position of the Brazilian league with 26 points after 22 matches, will take on Southern rival Internacional two days prior to the launch and then host Sao Paulo countryside team one day after the release.",
      "Fans like lawyer Sidney Abreu, 45, couldn't care less about the NFL and Swift's music, but he will be watching part of Friday's game in the hopes the singer attends so the superstition can be revamped with her presence at the stadium.",
      "\u201cAs long as Corinthians wins those matches, she can come here and release her albums whenever she likes,\u201d he said.",

      "Artificial intelligence company Anthropic has agreed to pay $1.5 billion to settle a class-action lawsuit by book authors who say the company took pirated copies of their works to train its chatbot",
      "NEW YORK -- Artificial intelligence company Anthropic has agreed to pay $1.5 billion to settle a class-action lawsuit by book authors who say the company took pirated copies of their works to train its chatbot.",
      "The landmark settlement, if approved by a judge as soon as Monday, could mark a turning point in legal battles between AI companies and the writers, visual artists and other creative professionals who accuse them of copyright infringement.",
      "The company has agreed to pay authors or publishers about $3,000 for each of an estimated 500,000 books covered by the settlement.",
      "\u201cAs best as we can tell, it\u2019s the largest copyright recovery ever,\u201d said Justin Nelson, a lawyer for the authors. \u201cIt is the first of its kind in the AI era.\u201d",
      "A trio of authors \u2014 thriller novelist Andrea Bartz and nonfiction writers Charles Graeber and Kirk Wallace Johnson \u2014 sued last year and now represent a broader group of writers and publishers whose books Anthropic downloaded to train its chatbot Claude.",
      "A federal judge dealt the case a mixed ruling in June, finding that training AI chatbots on copyrighted books wasn\u2019t illegal but that Anthropic wrongfully acquired millions of books through pirate websites.",
      "If Anthropic had not settled, experts say losing the case after a scheduled December trial could have cost the San Francisco-based company even more money.",
      "\u201cWe were looking at a strong possibility of multiple billions of dollars, enough to potentially cripple or even put Anthropic out of business,\u201d said William Long, a legal analyst for Wolters Kluwer.",
      "U.S. District Judge William Alsup of San Francisco has scheduled a Monday hearing to review the settlement terms.",
      "Anthropic said in a statement Friday that the settlement, if approved, \u201cwill resolve the plaintiffs\u2019 remaining legacy claims.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe remain committed to developing safe AI systems that help people and organizations extend their capabilities, advance scientific discovery, and solve complex problems,\u201d said Aparna Sridhar, the company's deputy general counsel.",
      "As part of the settlement, the company has also agreed to destroy the original book files it downloaded.",
      "Books are known to be important sources of data \u2014 in essence, billions of words carefully strung together \u2014 that are needed to build the AI large language models behind chatbots like Anthropic\u2019s Claude and its chief rival, OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT.",
      "Alsup\u2019s June ruling found that Anthropic had downloaded more than 7 million digitized books that it \u201cknew had been pirated.\u201d It started with nearly 200,000 from an online library called Books3, assembled by AI researchers outside of OpenAI to match the vast collections on which ChatGPT was trained.",
      "Debut thriller novel \u201cThe Lost Night\u201d by Bartz, a lead plaintiff in the case, was among those found in the dataset.",
      "Anthropic later took at least 5 million copies from the pirate website Library Genesis, or LibGen, and at least 2 million copies from the Pirate Library Mirror, Alsup wrote.",

The settlement's higher award \u2014 approximately $3,000 per work \u2014 likely reflects a smaller pool of affected books, after taking out duplicates and those without copyright.",
      "On Friday, Mary Rasenberger, CEO of the Authors Guild, called the settlement \u201can excellent result for authors, publishers, and rightsholders generally, sending a strong message to the AI industry that there are serious consequences when they pirate authors\u2019 works to train their AI, robbing those least able to afford it.\u201d",
      "The Danish Rights Alliance, which successfully fought to take down one of those shadow libraries, said Friday that the settlement would be of little help to European writers and publishers whose works aren\u2019t registered with the U.S. Copyright Office.",
      "\u201cOn the one hand, it\u2019s comforting to see that compiling AI training datasets by downloading millions of books from known illegal file-sharing sites comes at a price,\u201d said Thomas Heldrup, the group\u2019s head of content protection and enforcement.",
      "On the other hand, Heldrup said it fits a tech industry playbook to grow a business first and later pay a relatively small fine, compared to the size of the business, for breaking the rules.",
      "\u201cIt is my understanding that these companies see a settlement like the Anthropic one as a price of conducting business in a fiercely competitive space,\u201d Heldrup said.",
      "The privately held Anthropic, founded by ex-OpenAI leaders in 2021, earlier this week put its value at $183 billion after raising another $13 billion in investments.",
      "Anthropic also said it expects to make $5 billion in sales this year, but, like OpenAI and many other AI startups, it has never reported making a profit, relying instead on investors to back the high costs of developing AI technology for the expectation of future payoffs.",
      "The settlement could influence other disputes, including an ongoing lawsuit by authors and newspapers against OpenAI and its business partner Microsoft, and cases against Metaand Midjourney. And just as the Anthropic settlement terms were filed, another group of authors sued Apple on Friday in the same San Francisco federal court.",
      "\u201cThis indicates that maybe for other cases, it\u2019s possible for creators and AI companies to reach settlements without having to essentially go for broke in court,\u201d said Long, the legal analyst.",
      "The industry, including Anthropic, had largely praised Alsup\u2019s June ruling because he found that training AI systems on copyrighted works so chatbots can produce their own passages of text qualified as \u201cfair use\u201d under U.S. copyright law because it was \u201cquintessentially transformative.\u201d",
      "Comparing the AI model to \u201cany reader aspiring to be a writer,\u201d Alsup wrote that Anthropic \"trained upon works not to race ahead and replicate or supplant them \u2014 but to turn a hard corner and create something different.\"",
      "But documents disclosed in court showed Anthropic employees\u2019 internal concerns about the legality of their use of pirate sites. The company later shifted its approach and hired Tom Turvey, the former Google executive in charge of Google Books, a searchable library of digitized books that successfully weathered years of copyright battles.",
      "With his help, Anthropic began buying books in bulk, tearing off the bindings and scanning each page before feeding the digitized versions into its AI model, according to court documents. That was legal but didn\u2019t undo the earlier piracy, according to the judge.",

      "MILAN -- For Giorgio Armani, it was always the clothes. And his clothes all started with the fabrics.",
      "While other fashion empires make their money on handbags and footwear, Armani\u2019s appeal has always been in the apparel, the core of his $10 billion empire.",
      "After his death Thursday at the age of 91, Armani has been remembered for softening the 1980s power suit, decades of fruitful Hollywood collaborations and as a defining figure of Italian luxury ready-to-wear.",
      "But he was also a keen business owner who maintained his independence in an era of consolidation, an innovative communicator and a boss who was in charge of every aspect of his business.",
      "\u201cI have to say, King George is the first in everything. The first but not the only,\u2019\u2019 said Mario Boselli, who was president of the Italian fashion chamber from 1999-2015. \u201cHe was the master of luxury ready-to-wear.\u201d",
      "The deconstructed, soft-shouldered Armani jacket catapulted Armani to fashion stardom, first with Richard Gere in the 1980 film \u201cAmerican Gigolo,\u2019\u2019 and then as the centerpiece of a women\u2019s wardrobe.",
      "\u201cI would say that the famous Armani jacket was a discovery that allowed women to live every day with an Armani garment that could go from work to dates. Armani could dress a woman from morning to evening, I would say with great precision, for every occasion,\u2019\u2019 Boselli said.",
      "Armani himself said in his 2015 memoir he wanted to create \u201ca new kind of femininity that forced men to look at women with new eyes.\u2019\u2019",
      "\u201cI have great esteem for women. I think they know how to be seductive without resorting to an exhibitionism that easily slips into vulgarity and excess,\u2019\u2019 Armani wrote. He credited American women as \u201cthe first to appreciate my work \u2014 and my audacity.\u2019\u2019",
      "Jackets remained the core of his collections through the decades. But with time he introduced more couture elements into his ready-to-wear in part to counter his image as the power suit designer, said Scott Schuman, the Milan-based photographer behind The Sartorialist fashion blog and the creator of the Armani tribute Instagram account @armaniarchive.",
      "Every collection started with a cascade of textiles on a huge table, which Armani himself would examine after his team made a first selection.",
      "\u201cThe collection, and the mood and the vibe started from the fabrics,\u2019\u2019 said Milan-based Austrian designer Arthur Arbesser, who was on the Armani design team for seven years until leaving in 2013 to launch his own brand.",
      "\u201cThat was unique, I learned from him what it was to touch the fabrics, then to come in with another fabric and with another shade to form a gradient of colors,\u2019\u2019 Arbesser said.",
      "Boselli first met Armani 45 years ago, arriving at his Borgnonuovo offices with a satchel of jersey knit samples as a sales rep for his family\u2019s textile company.",
      "\u201cHe saw the entire collection of fabrics, and chose them personally,\u2019\u2019 Boselli recalled. \u201cThat is not something everyone does. It takes time, it takes care. He had great respect for the work of others.\u2019\u2019",
      "Shuman said the fabric choices made going into Armani's stores \u201ca sensory overload.\u201d",

      "\u201cArmani was a beautiful river of design. You could pop in and out, and there was some kind of continuity,\u2019\u2019 Schuman said.",
      "Kenneth Richard, founder of The Impression, an influential fashion newsletter, called Armani \"the original game-changer,'' for the scale of a fashion empire he built himself, and for extending his brand into areas like home decor and hotels while maintaining his famed attention to detail.",
      "\u201cYou can check into an Armani hotel, get fitted downstairs and go to a red carpet event. Where else can you do this? You are sleeping on Armani sheets, in an Armani bed, with an Armani couch,'' Richard said. And all of it is owned by Armani, not licensed as many brands do.",
      "On the runway, Armani \u201cstuck to a singular voice through 50 years.\u201d",
      "\u201cHis aesthetic was refined, and approachable. You cannot become a $10 billion brand when you are consistently doing the same thing over and over again, without being approachable. He sells. People want to wear his clothing.\u201d",
      "Giorgio Armani's final collection will be previewed during Milan Fashion Week later this month during an event marking 50 years of his signature fashion house.",

      "The question of generational succession has always been a fraught one in Italy's largely family run fashion industry. Armani's attention to every detail in the empire he launched 50 years ago will make him a tough act to follow.",
      "\u201cHe was involved in very step of the process from the very beginning to the end. Every photograph, every font, everything,'' Arbesser said. \"That is what makes a difference. These days, there is no boss, no creative director, who has so much control over everything. That is where the magic is. And that is where it is hard to see what is going to happen now.\u201d",

      "A new generation of songwriters are stepping into the spotlight, gaining recognition alongside the artists they write for",
      "New York -- When songs top the charts, they become inescapable: Cross-genre hits are heard on the radio, on streaming, in lobbies and grocery stores. The artists who perform them become famous. But the people who wrote those earworms? Many do not.",
      "At least, that used to be the case.",
      "In the last few years, a new generation of songwriters has begun stepping into the spotlight. Muni Long has a successful R&B career; songwriter HARDY has done the same in the country music space. Julia Michaels writes big pop hits and records her own. Victoria Mon\u00e9t went from Grammy nominations as a songwriter and producer to taking home trophies as a solo artist. Amy Allen has become a household name following the ubiquity of her work with Sabrina Carpenter. The same could be said about \u00c9dgar Barrera, who has dominated Latin music as both a songwriter and producer.",
      "On Netflix, a new reality show, \u201cHitmakers,\u201d follows a group of songwriters as they ship off to writing camps to work on songs for John Legend, Shaboozey, Usher and Blackpink\u2019s Lisa.",
      "The industry has taken note, too. For the 2023 Grammys, a \u201csongwriter of the year\u201d award was created to spotlight the talents of those who write for others. That year\u2019s award went to Tobias Jesso Jr., for his songs for Harry Stiles, Adele, FKA Twigs and others. Theron Thomas won in 2024 and Allen in 2025.",
      "Here\u2019s how it happened.",
      "Why is there a buzz around songwriters now? The answer is challenging to pinpoint. Allen says she\u2019s noticed a shift in \u201cthe past six years,\u201d she told The Associated Press.",
      "\u201cI am so grateful that the general public is starting to take interest in the people behind the curtain of how music is made,\u201d Allen said. \u201cBut I think songwriters have kind of long gone without any type of visibility or recognition.\u201d",
      "She credits fans \u2013 modern music listeners \u2013 for driving attention to her and her colleagues and social media platforms like TikTok for some of this newfound interest. Online, dedicated fans are curious about the names behind their favorite songs, what Allen describes as a desire to \u201cconnect the dots \u2026 like they\u2019re trying to solve a murder mystery.\u201d",
      "PYNK BEARD, an emerging country music artist and a Grammy-award winning R&B songwriter under the moniker Sebastian Kole, agrees, but says that crate-digging behavior is reserved for \u201csuper fans.\u201d Algorithms, too, must be credited here: The exposure to other artists \u2014 including songwriters \u2014 emerges from listening to a playlist or online radio.",
      "Michaels says some of the credit goes to the artists they write for, who are making their collaborators known by name.",
      "\u201cI sometimes think songwriters are sort of the dishwater of the music industry. We get the short end of the stick a lot of the time. And so, it really comes down to artists\u2019 recognition of songwriters,\u201d she says. \u201cFor that to happen is really special. And I see it happen more and more nowadays. It\u2019s really great that songwriters are getting their flowers.\u201d",

      "The majority of PYNK BEARD\u2019s songwriting career as Sebastian Kole has been in the R&B space, working with Alessia Cara, Legend, Alicia Keys, Halle Bailey and more. As a solo artist, he makes country music. He says writing for others and writing for himself are two distinct skill sets, each a unique expression of creativity and empathy. \u201cAs a songwriter, my job is to listen and mimic,\u201d he says. \u201cMy job as a songwriter is to get as close to their voice as possible.\u201d",

      "In the music industry, artists, songwriters, and producers earn income from their creative works via music royalties. There are two kinds: publishing (the notes, melodies, chords, rhythms, lyrics, etc.) and master rights (the master recording, typically owned by the record label). Songwriters do not receive master rights, which limits how much they are compensated.",
      "\u201cYou can\u2019t make any money. You can\u2019t make a living. But if you are the artist, then all of a sudden, you get to participate on the master,\u201d he says. That changes things.",
      "But ultimately, it\u2019s not just a financial reality. Songwriters choosing to record their own music is just another expression of creative autonomy.",
      "\u201cAs an artist, you get to be more in the driver\u2019s seat,\u201d he says. \u201cI think you\u2019ll see a lot more songwriters doing that.\u201d",

      "TORONTO -- TORONTO (AP) \u2014 \u201cI wish I had more bad things to say about him,\u201d Bill Murray says in the opening moments of the documentary \u201cJohn Candy: I Like Me.\u201d",
      "It has always been hard to find a negative word about Candy. The great Canadian comedian and actor not only radiated a warm, down-to-earth friendliness in movies like \u201cPlanes, Trains and Automobiles,\u201d \u201cUncle Buck\u201d and \u201cThe Great Outdoors,\u201d he was that way off screen, too. As Mel Brooks says in the film, \u201cHe was a total actor because he was a total person.\u201d",
      "\u201cJohn Candy: I Like Me,\u201d directed by Colin Hanks and produced by Ryan Reynolds, is a tribute not just to Candy the actor, but Candy, the man. On Thursday night, it premieres as the opening night film of the Toronto International Film Festival. For a beloved Canadian icon like Candy, whose nickname was \u201cJohnny Toronto,\u201d the setting could hardly be more fitting. To reference Candy\u2019s cameo in \u201cThe Blues Brothers,\u201d it\u2019s an occasion that calls for orange whips, all around.",
      "\u201cI can\u2019t tell you the amount of meetings we had about when the movie can be made, and maybe we can do this festival or that,\u201d Hanks says. \u201cAnd I just kept thinking in the back of my mind: Well, this is a gigantic waste of time. It should just be at Toronto. Period. The End.\u201d",
      "\u201cJohn Candy: I Like Me,\u201d which will debut on Prime Video on Oct. 10, is a kind of cinematic eulogy for Candy, who died of heart failure at the age of 43 in 1994. Long ago as that was, \u201cI Like Me\u201d is the first feature documentary to tackle Candy, who might be even more popular three decades after his death.",
      "\u201cPart of me hates the fact that John maybe never really saw how beloved he was,\u201d Reynolds says. \u201cHe left something really lasting. He died of a heart failure and ironically the thing he left behind was his heart. That\u2019s the thing that stays.\u201d",
      "Hanks, Reynolds and Candy\u2019s children, Jennifer and Chris Candy, spoke in interviews before the TIFF opening about the making of \u201cJohn Candy: I Like Me,\u201d the title of which comes from one of Candy\u2019s most memorable lines from \u201cTrains, Planes and Automobiles.\u201d But it also serves as a guiding ethos to the documentary.",
      "Candy, who grew up in working-class Ontario and whose father also died young, had his own long-range struggles with that loss. He also, through a people-pleasing smile, dealt with the sometimes insensitive way his size was discussed in the media. Says Reynolds: \u201cHe was self-effacing his work, but not self-loathing. He didn\u2019t make a sport of punching down, not even on himself.\u201d",
      "\u201cHe left, but he did leave us some tools to get through this,\u201d says Chris Candy, 40, speaking alongside his 45-year-old sister. \u201cThat would be through the way he raised us and also saying it\u2019s OK to talk to someone if you have heavy feelings.\u201d",
      "For the Candys, \u201cI Like Me\u201d is an extremely emotional experience but one they\u2019re grateful for. They have each navigated their own way through an upbringing marked by their father\u2019s loss. It was years before Chris could visit his father\u2019s grave site or rewatch his movies. Once he did, he was astonished at his father\u2019s talent.",
      "For Jennifer, her father's movies helped carry her through grief.",
      "\u201cI jumped in and watched everything. All through college, I made sure I had the whole DVD collection,\u201d she says. \u201cFor me that was a constant reminder to hear his voice.

      "TOKYO -- A three-hour film about the esoteric world of Kabuki is defying the odds at the Japanese box office, with tickets selling out at some cinemas.",
      "\u201cKokuho,\u201d which means \u201cnational treasure,\u201d has already grossed more than 10 billion yen ($68 million), making it the second-highest grossing Japanese live-action film of all time, and the first to achieve that in more than two decades.",
      "It stars heartthrobs Ryo Yoshizawa and Ryusei Yokohama who portray longtime rivals and soulmates. They are both Kabuki \u201connagata\u201d actors, meaning they specialize in women roles, from gorgeous princesses to damsels in distress.",
      "They look stunning, and convincing, having gone through months of training with a real Kabuki actor.",
      "Japan has submitted the film for the international feature category at the Academy Awards. The short list of the 15 films from which the final nominations come will be announced Dec. 16.",
      "\u201cKohuko\u201d got a favorable reception at the Cannes Film Festival. And it's been seen 7.4 million times in the first 73 days in Japanese theaters, many of them repeat viewers.",
      "The plot of \u201cKokuho\u201d \u2014 pronounced Koh-koo-hoe \u2014 explores perennial themes of family and the grueling hardships of being an artist, set to the backdrop of the intense but dreamlike life of the Kabuki actor.",
      "It also pays homage to old-style yakuza movies, as well as obliquely to Western gangster films, like \u201cThe Godfather,\u201d because one of the heroes is the son of a gangster.",
      "In short, it\u2019s not the kind of material that usually makes a hit movie in Japan, where action-packed blockbusters or animation based on popular manga comics or spectacular special effects have drawn audiences in the past.",
      "But the movie\u2019s theme explores something intrinsically Japanese and hit a raw nerve in a country where soul-searching about national pride is on the rise amid a widespread perception that economic and political clout is on the decline.",
      "Being an outsider was the theme that jumped out for tourism science scholar Yosuke Kon.",
      "\u201cThe Kabuki world seems very special, but a Kabuki kind of mentality exists in many places in Japan,\u201d he told The Associated Press, noting a closed mentality is prevalent in the village, as well as local governments he has worked with.",
      "\u201cMany people can relate to the film,\u201d he added.",
      "The film is dominated by stage scenes from Kabuki, an art form dating to the 17th century, which combines stylized dance and acting to live music. It\u2019s been stereotyped as catering to old people, as younger generations turn to Western and modern forms of entertainment like boys\u2019 bands, baseball games and streaming services.",
      "In Kabuki, all the roles are played by men, wearing thick makeup and elaborate kimono, delivering sing-song lines in tales of intrigue and violence set in the samurai era.",
      "The film shows the dazzling esoteric elements of Kabuki, such as the backstage where actors apply makeup with their fingertips, or the flutter of paper snowflakes or flower petals on the stage.",

      "Hiroyuki Okada, a teacher in the traditional \u201cikebana\u201d flower arrangement, said the film gave him a sense of satisfaction as though he had seen high quality theater, and that the characters seemed to represent light and darkness, or the Asian duality of \u201cyin and yang.\u201d",

      "The success of the film has sparked interest in the two-volume best-selling book by Shuichi Yoshida it is based on. Yoshida worked as a stagehand for several years to learn the workings of Kabuki.",
      "The film has been brought to the screen by acclaimed director Sang-il Lee, whose credits include the 2007 award-winning film \u201cHula Girls\u201d and the 2022 Apple TV series \u201cPachinko,\u201d as well as the Japanese-language version of Clint Eastwood\u2019s \u201cUnforgiven.\u201d",

      "Lee was deeply moved to see people watching his film, glued to the screen. The scene was straight out of the movies, he recalled",
      "\u201cThere the barriers of generations were gone, living proof that everyone is searching for the moment that truly touches our emotions, knowing how beautiful those tears that flow for no reason can be,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cFilms are so wonderful.

      "Patrick Hemingway, the last surviving child of Ernest Hemingway who in emulation of his father lived for years in Africa and later oversaw numerous posthumous works by the Nobel laureate, has died",
      "NEW YORK -- Patrick Hemingway, the last surviving child of Ernest Hemingway who was inspired by his father to spend years in Africa and later oversaw numerous posthumous works by the Nobel laureate, died Tuesday at age 97.",
      "Hemingway, the second of the author's three sons, died at his home in Bozeman, Montana, his grandson, Patrick Hemingway Adams, confirmed in a statement.",
      "\u201cMy grandfather was the real thing: a larger than life paradox from the old world; a consummate dreamer saddled with a scientific brain. He spoke half a dozen languages and solved complicated mathematical problems for fun, but his heart truly belonged to the written and visual arts,\u201d Adams said.",
      "While brother Gregory Hemingway had a deeply troubled relationship with his famous parent, Patrick Hemingway spoke proudly of his background and welcomed the chance to bring up the family name or get behind a project he thought could sell or attract critical attention. In the 2022 book \u201cDear Papa: The Letters of Patrick and Ernest Hemingway,\u201d father and son share stories of hunting and fishing and express mutual affection, with the author telling Patrick that \u201cI would rather fish with you and shoot with you than anybody that I have ever known since I was a boy and this is not because we are related.\u201d",
      "As an executor of his father's estate, Patrick Hemingway approved reissues of such classics as \"A Farewell to Arms\" and \"A Moveable Feast,\" featuring revised texts and additional commentary from the author\u2019s son and others. The estate also unsettled Hemingway admirers by expanding beyond books and offering a line of products that included clothing, eyewear, rugs and \"Papa's Pilar Rum.\"",
      "Patrick's most ambitious undertaking was the editing of \"True at First Light,\" a fictionalized account of Ernest Hemingway's time in Africa in the mid-1950s that the author left unfinished at the time of his death. Patrick assembled the 1999 release from some 800 pages of manuscripts, cutting the length by more than half. \"True at First Light\" was highly anticipated, but ended up disappointing readers and critics, some of whom faulted Patrick for exploiting the family name.",
      "Asked by NPR if he read his father's work, Patrick replied: \"Pretty often, because I have a commercial interest. ... I have to read it in order to be competent in the marketing of it and the management of it.\"",
      "Hemingway managed a long life in a family haunted by suicide and mental illness: Ernest Hemingway's father, Clarence, killed himself in 1928, and the author did the same in 1961. Gregory Hemingway suffered from alcoholism and depression and died in a jail cell in 2001 after being arrested for indecent exposure. Patrick's half-niece, the actor and model Margaux Hemingway, died from an overdose of phenobarbital in 1996. (Jack Hemingway, the eldest son, died in 2000).",
      "Inheriting his father\u2019s round face and stocky build, Patrick Hemingway was born in Kansas City, Missouri, to Ernest Hemingway and the second of his four wives, Pauline Pfeiffer. Because the author rarely stayed in one place for an extended time, the Hemingways lived everywhere from Cuba and Spain to Wyoming and Key West, Florida during Patrick\u2019s childhood (Ernest and Pauline divorced in 1940). Patrick Hemingway would recall his father\u2019s various \u201ctrophy mounts\u201d of animals hunted down on safari and how they were \u201ctastefully distributed throughout every room\u201d of their Key West house, including a wildebeest that hung in the bedroom of Patrick and Gregory.",

      "Patrick Hemingway was married twice, to Henrietta Broyles and Carol Thompson, and had a daughter, Mina Hemingway, with his first wife. From the mid-1970s until his death, he was based in Bozeman. Ernest Hemingway spent his final years in the neighboring state of Idaho.",
      "\"Sometimes I think of him when I could just barely remember him, you know, when he was just someone who'd kissed you and you didn't really want to be kissed because the whiskers were a little bit rough on your face,\" Patrick told NPR in 2008. \"And later on it was, you know, when he came to Africa ... and we'd be riding at night just having fun, you know.",

      "In a brief statement when the deal was announced on Aug. 18, Sangha's lawyer Mark Geragos said only, \u201cShe's taking responsibility for her actions.\u201d",

      "The final plea deal came a year after federal prosecutors announced that five people had been charged in Perry\u2019s Oct. 28, 2023 death after a sweeping investigation.",
      "If Sangha pleads guilty as planned, a judge will schedule sentencing for Sangha. She could get up to 45 years in prison.

None of the co-defendants have been sentenced yet.",
      "Sangha and Dr. Salvador Plasencia, who pleaded guilty in July, had been the primary targets of the investigation.

      "Kim Novak has made an emotional return to the spotlight at 92",
      "VENICE, Italy -- VENICE, Italy (AP) \u2014 Kim Novak was worried she\u2019d made a mistake. The 92-year-old star of Alfred Hitchcock\u2019s \u201cVertigo\u201d had made the long trek from Oregon to Venice, Italy, for the film festival. There she\u2019d be receiving a lifetime achievement award and supporting the world premiere of a documentary about her life and career, \u201cKim Novak\u2019s Vertigo.\u201d",
      "But on that first day, she wasn\u2019t feeling strong or up to the task.",
      "\u201cI thought I could handle it, then I thought, no I can\u2019t, I\u2019m not physically strong enough,\u201d Novak told The Associated Press this week. \u201cThen I heard my mother\u2019s voice from heaven and she said \u2018just have fun and enjoy it.\u2019\u201d",
      "Novak listened to that voice and was glad she did. Being bipolar, she said, she\u2019s used to going through a lot of emotions. But the experience in Venice has been a dream.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s one of the very first events that I\u2019ve really had fun, really fun,\u201d she said.",
      "Earlier in the week, she was presented with a Golden Lion lifetime achievement award. Filmmaker Guillermo del Toro, who presented the honor, listed off many of her most famous credits, including \u201cVertigo,\u201d Otto Preminger\u2019s \u201cThe Man with the Golden Arm,\u201d Joshua Logan\u2019s \u201cPicnic,\u201d \u201cPal Joey\u201d and \u201cBell, Book and Candle.\u201d Novak was the top box-office star in the world from 1958 through 1960 and became the first woman to start her own production company before leaving Hollywood behind in 1966 to live a private life devoted to painting.",
      "\u201cMost impressive is the fact that she was capable of projecting frailty, power, mystery. To appear, endearing, dynamic, mythical and phenomenal,\u201d del Toro said. \u201cAnd with all those wonderful arresting performances, she always carried a little bit of warmth, a little bit of heartbreak and a little bit of mystery.\u201d",
      "Novak reflects on her extraordinary life in Alexandre O. Philippe\u2019s documentary, which premiered out of competition in Venice. She said it was fate that Philippe came into her life and wanted to make the film.",
      "\u201cI was at the point where I wanted to talk about my life, because I\u2019m at the end of my life,\u201d Novak said. \u201cIt was meant to be. And I can\u2019t think of anyone it was better to do it with.\u201d",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t even know my phone had voice memos,\u201d she laughed. \u201cIt\u2019s not always easy for me to open up and discuss the intimate things, but it was wonderful because it was like I was talking to myself. Once you open the door, it all comes flooding out.\u201d",
      "Coming to the festival was brave of Novak, Philippe said. Just over a decade ago, Novak stepped back in the public eye to present at the 2014 Oscars, which led many online, including Donald Trump, to insult her appearance.",
      "\u201cThe easy thing would have been to stay in Oregon and keep painting,\u201d he said. \u201cAt this point in her life the hard thing is to come back into the spotlight and show herself again. But she did the hard thing. And she came on stage, not as an icon, not as a movie star, but she came on stage and said \u2018I am you and you are me.\u2019\u201d",

      "\u201cIt\u2019s time at the end of your life to put the puzzle pieces together and make them fit,\u201d Novak said. \u201cIt\u2019s an incredible experience to see them all falling in place and somehow coming to this festival is like putting some of the other pieces that you couldn\u2019t put together that now come together and make a whole beautiful, beautiful, picture.\u201d",
      "Even the \u201cVertigo\u201d suit she once hated so much as taken on a different light. In the film, she gets to see the costume for the first time since making the film. The fabric that she remembered having been so rough and hard had softened with time, which seemed like an apt metaphor.",
      "\u201cThe opportunity to see it when you have all this life behind you, it makes you think that what you thought was right when you were young is not necessarily so. It could be wrong, and vice versa,\u201d she said. \u201cBut all this you gain over time. And so becoming old is a beautiful thing, you know? And this festival, being able to experience it through Hollywood eyes, it\u2019s just incredible. I loved it, I love it. I\u2019m experiencing great joy.\u201d",

      "\u201cWhat is sweeter in the world than appreciation,\u201d she said. \u201cI feel appreciated and you can\u2019t know how much that means.\u201d",
      "She\u2019s also looking forward to getting home and painting again. Every night at the festival she\u2019s found herself sketching and dreaming up ideas for more works.",

      "VENICE, Italy -- VENICE, Italy (AP) \u2014 Jude Law transforms into Vladimir Putin for Olivier Assayas\u2019 \u201cThe Wizard of the Kremlin,\u201d which has its world premiere Sunday at the Venice Film Festival.",
      "The film is an adaptation of Giuliano da Empoli\u2019s bestselling book of the same name, an account of the Russian President's rise to power alongside a fictional adviser called Vadim Baranov, who is played by Paul Dano. It's partially set in the early 1990s amid post-Soviet chaos.",
      "Dano\u2019s character was inspired by the real political strategist Vladislav Sourkov, who was considered the architect of the tightly controlled political system created under Putin. In 2013, he resigned his post of deputy prime minister.",
      "\u201cThe Wizard of the Kremlin\u201d is sure to provoke conversations as Russia\u2019s three-year war in Ukraine continues.

      "The film marks the English language debut for the French filmmaker best known for films like \u201cClouds of Sils Maria\u201d and \u201cPersonal Shopper,\u201d as well as the miniseries \u201cCarlos.\u201d Alicia Vikander, who he directed in \u201cIrma Vep,\u201d also co-stars in \u201cThe Wizard of the Kremlin.\u201d",
      "Production took place in Latvia as they couldn\u2019t film in Russia.",
      "Assayas wrote in his director\u2019s statement that it, \u201cis not a film about the rise of one man \u2014 nor is it about the force with which power is imposed, or the reinvention of a nation that is both modern and archaic, once again under the yoke of totalitarianism. Rooted in real, contemporary events, it is instead a reflection on modern politics \u2014 or rather, the smoke screens behind which it now hides: cynical, deceptive, and toxic.\u201d",

      "Contaminated metal at an industrial site in Indonesia may be the source of radioactive material that led to massive recalls of imported frozen shrimp, international nuclear safety officials say, as efforts are underway to halt more U.S.-bound shipments.",
      "The International Atomic Energy Agency said Friday that officials are in \u201cconstant contact\u201d with Indonesian nuclear regulators who have detected Cesium-137, a radioactive isotope, at a processing plant that sent millions of pounds of shrimp to the U.S.",
      "\u201cPreliminary information suggests that it may have originated from activities at a metal melting facility at the same industrial site or from the disposal of scrap metal junk to other areas of the site,\u201d IAEA spokesperson Fredrik Dahl said in an email.",
      "No U.S. investigators have been sent to the site in Serang, west of Jakarta, federal officials said.",
      "Meanwhile, the company that exported the shrimp, PT Bahari Makmur Sejati, also known as BMS Foods, has recalled more than 300 shipping containers that were already on their way to the U.S., Dahl said.",
      "The U.S. Food and Drug Administration warned last month that Cesium-137 was detected in shipping containers sent to four U.S. ports, and in a sample of imported frozen shrimp. That spurred multiple recalls of shrimp sold at Walmart, Kroger and other stores.",
      "This week, additional recalls were issued by Tampa Maid Foods LLC, of Florida, for breaded butterfly shrimp sold under Admiral of the Fleet, Portico Seafood Classic and other labels.",
      "None of the shrimp that triggered alerts or tested positive for Cesium-137 was released for sale, the FDA said. But other shipments sent to stores may have been manufactured under conditions that allowed the products to become contaminated, the agency said.",
      "The risk appears to be small, but the shrimp could pose a \u201cpotential health concern\u201d for people exposed to low levels of Cesium-137 over time, FDA officials said.",
      "The FDA issued an import alert for shrimp from BMS Foods to stop the products from coming into the U.S.",

      "The level of Cesium-137 detected in the frozen shrimp was about 68 becquerels per kilogram, a measure of radioactivity. That is far below the FDA\u2019s level of 1,200 becquerels per kilogram that could trigger the need for health protections.",
      "Still, it is unusual to see that concentration of Cesium-137 in shrimp, said Steve Biegalski, a nuclear medicine expert at the Georgia Institute of Technology.",
      "It\u2019s possible that the contamination could have come from recycling old medical equipment that contained Cesium-137, Biegalski said. The material has been used in medical devices to reduce blood contamination and to treat cancer, for instance.",

      "Texas lawmakers on Wednesday approved letting private citizens sue abortion pill manufacturers, doctors and anyone who mails the medication, setting the state up to be the first to try to crack down on the most common abortion method.",
      "The law would be the first of its kind in the U.S. and add another layer of abortion restrictions in Texas, which has some of the toughest in the country and already bans nearly all abortions.",
      "The bill now goes to Republican Gov. Greg Abbott, an abortion opponent who is expected to sign it into law. It would take effect in December, though it is nearly certain to spark legal challenges from abortion rights supporters.",
      "Supporters of the proposal, which passed a final vote in the GOP-controlled Texas Senate, call it a key tool to enforce the state's ban and protect women and fetuses. Opponents see it as not only another way to rein in abortion but intimidate providers outside Texas who are complying with the laws in their states. They also say it would encourage a form of vigilantism.",
      "Under the measure, Texas residents could sue those who manufacture, transport or provide abortion-inducing drugs to anyone in Texas for up to $100,000. Women who receive the pills for their own use would not be liable.",
      "Under the bill, providers could be ordered to pay $100,000. But only the pregnant woman, the man who impregnated her or other close relatives could collect the entire amount. Anyone else who sues could receive only $10,000, with the remaining $90,000 going to charity.",
      "Lawmakers also added language to address worries that women would be turned in for seeking to end pregnancies by men who raped them or abusive partners. For instance, a man who impregnated a woman through sexual assault would not be eligible.",
      "The measure has provisions that bar making public the identity or medical details about a woman who receives the pills.",
      "It wasn\u2019t until those provisions were added, along with the limit of a $10,000 payment for people who aren\u2019t themselves injured by the abortion, that several major Texas anti-abortion groups backed the bill.",

      "The idea of using citizens rather than government officials to enforce abortion bans is not new in Texas. It was at the heart of 2021 law that curtailed abortion there months before the U.S. Supreme Court cleared the way for other state bans to take effect.",
      "In the earlier law, citizens could collect $10,000 for bringing a successful lawsuit against a provider or anyone who helps someone obtain an abortion. But that measure didn\u2019t explicitly seek to go after out-of-state providers.",

      "MOROGORO, Tanzania -- A man lies unmoving, slumped in the rubble of a simulated earthquake, as an unlikely rescuer approaches: a rat with a backpack. Whiskers waving, the rat breezes past garbage, toppled furniture and scattered clothes to find him and pull a trigger on its pack, alerting searchers above.",
      "Then a resounding click. A survivor has been found. The search in Morogoro in Tanzania\u2019s Uluguru Mountains is over and the rat scurries out of the abandoned building to be rewarded with a banana. A successful mission is complete for this African giant pouched rat being trained for search and rescue operations.",
      "\u201cTheir sense of smell is incredible,\u201d said Fabrizio Dell\u2019Anna, an animal behaviorist at APOPO, a Tanzania-based nongovernmental organization that trains the rats for lifesaving applications. \u201cThese rats are able to detect explosives, tuberculosis \u2014 even tiny amounts of the bacteria \u2014 and in this project, they are able to correctly identify and indicate humans.\u201d",
      "In a field nearby, more rats walk on leashes held between handlers, pacing a grid filled with land mines as part of an initiative by APOPO, which works alongside Sokoine University of Agriculture. When they pause, it indicates that explosives are beneath. These rats are readying for their next deployment, perhaps Angola or Cambodia, where APOPO has helped clear more than 50,000 land mines since 2014.",
      "From detecting land mines to sniffing out tuberculosis, these \u201chero rats\u201d have become unlikely, and sometimes unrecognized, front-line responders in Tanzania and beyond.",
      "For decades APOPO has trained these \u201chero rats,\u201d which have one of the most sensitive noses in the animal kingdom. Since 2003, the rats have been finding land mines and, more recently, have been turned on to trafficked wildlife and earthquake survivors.",
      "The rats begin training shortly after birth for specific missions and, with a longer-than-average rodent life span of almost a decade, can spend years carrying out their work. The cost of training each rat runs around 6,000 euros ($6,990).",
      "It is all done with classical conditioning and positive reinforcement, explained Dell\u2019Anna, who oversees the search and rescue program. The first cohort of this group of specialized rats are already in Turkey with a partner search and rescue organization.",
      "While the rats focused on explosives or survivors buried in rubble get all the glory, it is a group of rats inside a lab that are arguably the most impactful lifesavers. These are not typical lab rats, but rather, as their proponents would argue, one of the world\u2019s most effective detectors of tuberculosis.",
      "\u201cEvery day as many people die from TB as from land mines in a whole year,\u201d said Christophe Cox, the CEO of APOPO. \u201cIt\u2019s more spectacular to be on the minefield \u2026 but for TB \u2026 in terms of social impact, it\u2019s tremendous.\u201d",
      "Tuberculosis is an ancient respiratory disease that continues to run rampant despite centuries of research and treatment. The World Health Organization said last October in its most recent TB report that the disease had resurged as the top infectious disease killer, with 1.25 million deaths and a record 8.2 million infections in 2023.",
      "In sub-Saharan Africa, only about half of TB patients receive a diagnosis, according to a study by researchers in the UK and Gambia published in the National Library of Medicine, and this leaves them liable to spread the disease. Tanzania struggles with one of the highest global TB burdens, according to the WHO.",
      "APOPO expanded into TB detection in 2007 and its rats have been deployed in Tanzania, Ethiopia and Mozambique. The group works with 80 hospitals in Tanzania, collecting samples daily and bringing them to the lab rats.",
      "With their sensitive noses, the rats sniff out samples of sputum from patients, looking for positive TB cases that had been marked as negative. Research suggests the rats are picking up on six unique volatile organic compounds in positive TB samples, said Cox.",
      "False negatives remain a persistent issue in TB detection and suppression because each infected person can spread the disease to 10 to 15 more people each year.",
      "\u201cThe benefits of using rats are significant,\u201d said Felista Stanesloaus, a doctor at a TB clinic in Morogoro. \u201cThey help us detect cases that might otherwise be missed, which prevents people from unknowingly spreading infections.\u201d",

      "TB detection has made significant advances in recent years, including using artificial intelligence tools in conjunction with lung scans. However, many areas that are burdened most by TB, such as rural villages or low-income urban communities, do not have access to these tools.",
      "While the use of molecular detection devices, such as one called GeneXpert, have become more widespread, a clinic may only have one of these devices and it can take two hours to process a sample. Overburdened clinics turn to the centuries-old technique of microscopy, or investigation of sputum under a microscope, which is both fallible and time-consuming.",
      "\u201cHuman error may result in a person being told they are disease-free when they are not,\u201d said Stanesloaus. \u201cUsing rats is a very effective initiative.\u201d",
      "APOPO\u2019s rats can scan 100 samples in 20 minutes, and since the program's inception, the rats have been able to identify more than 30,000 patients who had been sent home with a clean bill of health but were actually carrying TB, said Cox. The NGO is able to do with one lab what 55 hospitals do in a day, he adds.",
      "Yet using live animals in the place of medical devices poses challenges, especially when it comes to scale. Samples have to be brought directly to a lab with enough trained rats to conduct the detection, with some samples brought to Morogoro by motorbike each day. Operations are most effective in dense urban centers, like Dar es Salaam, Cox said.",
      "The more existential challenge for these \u201chero rats\u201d comes from regulators and a wider health community who doubt this unconventional method of disease detection.",
      "APOPO\u2019s rats are not classified as primary diagnostic tools by the WHO. Instead, they are a second line of defense. Any positive samples detected by the rats must be confirmed with human microscopy in APOPO\u2019s labs before treatment can be administered.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a big challenge,\u201d said Cox. \u201cNot being recognized by the WHO means that the mainstream funding for TB \u2026 never reaches us.\u201d",
      "Cox has given up on the prospect of getting approval from the WHO, though APOPO has faced pressure from donors to go through this process, which would be extensive and rigorous with no guarantee of success.",

      "The Brazilian Supreme Court has added an extra day to its sessions next week to decide if former President Jair Bolsonaro and seven allies are guilty of attempting a coup",
      "RIO DE JANEIRO -- The Brazilian Supreme Court on Friday added an extra day to sessions planned next week to decide whether former President Jair Bolsonaro and seven other close allies are guilty of attempting a coup.",
      "Justices had initially planned hearings on Tuesday, Wednesday and Friday, but Justice Alexandre de Moraes, who is overseeing the case, asked for an additional day, which cour Chairman Cristiano Zanin granted. There will now also be proceedings on Thursday, the Supreme Court said in a statement.",
      "Bolsonaro is accused of leading a plot for a military takeover that would have allowed him to remain in power despite his election defeat to current President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva in October 2022.",
      "Bolsonaro denies wrongdoing and says he is the victim of a \u201c witch hunt \u201d that seeks to remove him from the political game.",
      "Seven other close allies of Bolsonaro are being tried alongside the former president, including Walter Braga Netto, his former running mate and defense minister, and Paulo S\u00e9rgio Nogueira, another former defense minister.",
      "Last week, De Moraes read the lengthy summary of the case, Prosecutor-General Paulo Gonet laid out his accusations, and then lawyers for the eight defendants took the floor.",
      "During the trial, the prosecution presented handwritten notes, digital files, message exchanges, and spreadsheets that they said were evidence of a conspiracy to keep Bolsonaro in power. Defense lawyers say that even if a coup was planned or discussed \u2014 something which they don't concede \u2014 no coup was attempted, and they say therefore the case is invalid.",

      "Iran is paving over a lot in Tehran's largest cemetery believed to be the final resting place for some of the thousands killed in the mass executions that followed the country's 1979 Islamic Revolution",
      "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- A desert-like patch of sand and scrawny trees in the largest cemetery in Iran's capital has been the final resting place for decades for some of the thousands killed in the mass executions that followed Iran's 1979 Islamic Revolution.",
      "Now, Lot 41 at the sprawling Behesht-e Zahra cemetery in Tehran is becoming a parking lot, with their remains likely beneath asphalt.",
      "Images from Planet Labs PBC show the parking lot being laid over the site, where opponents of Iran's nascent theocracy and others were rapidly buried following their executions at gunpoint or by hanging.",
      "The site, long monitored by surveillance cameras searching for any sign of dissent or remembrance at what officials have referred to as the \u201cscorched section,\" has seen state-sponsored demolition in the past, with grave markers vandalized and overturned. Iranian officials have acknowledged the recent decision to build the parking, without going into detail about those buried there.",
      "That's as a United Nations special rapporteur in 2024 described Iran's destruction of graveyards as an effort to \u201cconceal or erase data that could serve as potential evidence to avoid legal accountability\u201d over its actions.",
      "\u201cMost of the graves and gravestones of dissidents were desecrated, and the trees in the section were deliberately dried out,\u201d said Shahin Nasiri, a lecturer at the University of Amsterdam who has researched Lot 41. \u201cThe decision to convert this section into a parking lot fits into this broader pattern and represents the final phase of the destruction process.\u201d",
      "Last week, both a Tehran deputy mayor and the cemetery\u2019s manager acknowledged the plans to create a parking lot on the site.",
      "\u201cIn this place, hypocrites of the early days of the revolution were buried and it has remained without change for years,\u201d Tehran's deputy mayor Davood Goudarzi told journalists in footage aired by state television. \"We proposed that the authorities reorganize the space. Since we needed a parking lot, the permission for the preparation of the space was received. The job is ongoing in a precise and smart way.\u201d",
      "The satellite photos show the work began in earnest at the start of August. An Aug. 18 image shows about half of Lot 41 freshly paved over, with construction material still on site. Trucks and piles of asphalt can be seen at the site, suggesting work continued.",
      "The reformist newspaper Shargh quoted Mohammad Javad Tajik, who oversees the Behesht-e Zahra cemetery, as saying the parking lot would help people visit a neighboring lot, where authorities plan to bury those killed in the Iran-Israel war in June.",
      "A major airstrike campaign by Israel killed prominent military generals and others, with government officials putting the death toll at more than 1,060 people killed, with an activist group putting it at over 1,190.",
      "The decision to repurpose the graveyard appears to clash with Iran's own regulations, which allow for a cemetery to repurpose land where internments took place after more than 30 years \u2014 as long as families of the dead agree with the decision.",

      "\"The piece was not only for executed and political people. Ordinary people were buried there, too,\u201d he reportedly said.",
      "It remains unclear whether human remains sit beneath the layer of asphalt or if Iranian authorities moved the bones of the dead there. However, Iran has destroyed other graveyards in recent years for those killed in its 1988 mass execution that saw thousands put to death, leaving their bones there.",
      "Authorities have also vandalized cemeteries for the Baha'i, a religious minority in the country long targeted, and those home to protesters who have died in recent nationwide protests against Iran's theocracy from the 2009 Green Movement to the 2022 Mahsa Amini demonstrations.",
      "\u201cImpunity for atrocities and crimes against humanity has been building for decades in the Islamic Republic,\" said Hadi Ghaemi, the executive director of the New York-based Center for Human Rights in Iran. \u201cThere is a direct line between the massacres of the 1980s, the gunning down of demonstrators in 2009, and the mass killings of protesters in 2019 and 2022.\"",
      "Behesht-e Zahra, or the \u201cParadise of Zahra,\u201d opened in 1970 on what was then the rural outskirts of Tehran. As hundreds of thousands of Iranians flooded into the capital under the shah as the country's oil wealth skyrocketed, pressure on Tehran's cemeteries had grown to a point that the burgeoning metropolis needed a place for all of its dead as well.",
      "The cemetery has long been a resting place for some of the most famous Iranians since \u2014 and a point where history turned for the country.",
      "On his return to Iran in 1979 after years in exile, Grand Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini traveled first to the cemetery, where some of those killed in the uprising against the shah had been buried. Khomeini's cleric courts later issued death sentences for those now interred at Lot 41.",
      "After his death in 1989, Iran built a towering, golden-domed mausoleum for Khomeini connected to the cemetery. As Behesht-e Zahra grew, Lot 41 found itself surrounded by an ever-expanding number of lots for burials.",
      "Nasiri said his research with others suggests there are 5,000 to 7,000 burial sites within Lot 41 of those Iran \u201cconsidered religious outlaws,\u201d whether communists, militants, monarchists or others.",
      "\u201cMany survivors and family members of the victims are still searching for the graves of their loved ones,\u201d Nasiri said. \u201cThey seek justice and aim to hold the perpetrators accountable. The deliberate destruction of these burial sites adds an additional obstacle to efforts of truth-finding and the pursuit of historical justice.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Pope Leo XIV will preside over his first canonization ceremony Sunday to create the first millennial saint",
      "CHICAGO -- At a Catholic school in Pope Leo XIV\u2019s hometown, fifth graders read comic books about Carlo Acutis' life entitled \u201cDigital Disciple.\u201d They draw pictures of what the teenage Italian computer whiz might have had as his cellphone wallpaper. They discuss the miracles that allegedly occurred thanks to Acutis' intercession.",
      "In the run-up to Acutis' canonization Sunday, it is all Acutis, all the time at the Blessed Carlo Acutis Parish and school in Chicago. The parish was the first in the United States to take its name from Acutis, who died in 2006 at age 15 and is about to become history's first millennial saint.",
      "In recent years, Acutis has shot to near rockstar-like fame among many young Catholics, generating a global following the likes of which the Catholic Church hasn\u2019t seen in ages. Much of that popularity is thanks to a concerted campaign by the Vatican to give the next generation of faithful a relatable, modern-day role model, who used his technological talents to spread the faith.",
      "He\u2019s not a world figure like Mother Teresa or St. John Paul II, but rather a \u201csaint next door,\u201d said the Rev. Ed Howe, the pastor at Blessed Carlo Acutis Parish in Chicago\u2019s Northwest Side. \u201cHe\u2019s someone who I think a lot of young people today say, \u2018I could be the saint next door.'\"",
      "Leo, a Chicago native, will declare Acutis a saint Sunday in his first canonization ceremony, alongside another popular Italian, Pier Giorgio Frassati. Both ceremonies had been scheduled for earlier this year but were postponed following the death in April of Pope Francis.",
      "It was Francis who had fervently willed the Acutis sainthood case forward, convinced that the church needed someone like him to attract young Catholics to church while addressing the promises and perils of the digital age.",
      "Acutis was precociously savvy with computers before the social media era, reading college-level textbooks on programming and coding as a youngster. But he limited himself to an hour of video games a week, apparently deciding long before TikTok that human relationships were far more important than virtual ones.",
      "\u201cCarlo was well aware that the whole apparatus of communications, advertising and social networking can be used to lull us, to make us addicted to consumerism and buying the latest thing on the market,\u201d Francis wrote in a 2019 document. \u201cYet he knew how to use the new communications technology to transmit the Gospel, to communicate values and beauty.\u201d",
      "Leo inherited the Acutis cause, but he too has pointed to technology \u2014 especially artificial intelligence \u2014 as one of the main challenges facing humanity.",
      "For his admirers, Acutis was an ordinary kid who did extraordinary things, a typical Milan teen who went to school, played soccer and loved animals. But he also brought food to the poor, attended Mass daily and got his less-than-devout parents back to church.",
      "\u201cWhen I read his story for the first time, it was just like shocking to me because from a very early age he was just really drawn to Jesus Christ and he would go to Mass all the time,\u201d said Sona Harrison, an 8th grader at the St. John Berchmans\u2019 school, which is part of the Acutis parish. \u201cI feel like he\u2019s a lot more relatable and I definitely feel like I\u2019m closer to God when I read about him.\u201d",
      "Acutis earned the nickname \u201cGod\u2019s Influencer\u201d because he used technology to spread the faith. His most well-known tech legacy is the website he created about so-called Eucharistic miracles, available in nearly 20 different languages. The site compiles information about the 196 seemingly inexplicable events over the history of the church related to the Eucharist, which the faithful believe is the body of Christ.",
      "Acutis was known to spend hours in prayer before the Eucharist each day, a practice known as Eucharistic adoration.",
      "\u201cThis was the fixed appointment of his day,\u201d his mother, Antonia Salzano, said in a documentary that was airing Friday night at the U.S. seminary in Rome.",
      "Acutis was born on May 3, 1991, in London to Salzano and Andrea Acutis \u2014 a wealthy but not particularly observant Catholic family. They moved back to Milan soon after he was born and he enjoyed a typical, happy childhood, albeit marked by his increasingly intense religious devotion.",
      "In October 2006, at age 15, he fell ill with what was quickly diagnosed as acute leukemia. Within days he was dead. He was entombed in Assisi, which known for its association with another popular saint, St. Francis.",

      "In the years since his death, young Catholics have flocked by the millions to Assisi, where through a glass-sided tomb they can see the young Acutis, dressed in jeans, Nike sneakers and a sweatshirt, his hands clasped around a Rosary. Those who can\u2019t make it in person can watch the comings and goings on a webcam pointed at his tomb, a level of Internet accessibility not afforded to even popes buried in St. Peter\u2019s Basilica.",
      "Kathleen Sprows Cummings, a history professor at the University of Notre Dame, said Acutis\u2019 enormous popularity was clearly the result of a concerted church campaign, pushed strongly by his grief-stricken mother. But she said that is nothing new, and that in the 2,000-year history of the church, saints have very often been pushed ahead to respond to a particular need at a particular time.",
      "\u201cIt doesn\u2019t detract from the holiness of the person being honored to say that there are choices that are made,\u201d about which cases move forward, she said in a telephone interview.",
      "Sprows Cummings said the Acutis phenomenon caught on because he is attractive to both young people and the institutional church, because he used technology in a positive way to spread his profound belief in Eucharistic miracles at a time when many Catholics don\u2019t believe that Christ is truly present in the Eucharist.",
      "\u201cCanonization is about marketing,\u201d said Sprows Cummings, author of \u201cA Saint of Our Own: How the Quest for a Holy Hero Helped Catholics become American.\u201d \u201cWhich stories are going to get told? Who is going to get remembered through this amazingly efficient way of remembering holy people?\u201d",
      "Acutis and his story are ever-present here. During Mass this week ahead of the canonization, students processed into the chapel under an Acutis banner carrying things he might have had: a soccer ball, laptop and knapsack. Howe, the parish pastor and priest of the Congregation of the Resurrection, pulled items out of the knapsack to explain Acutis' story to the youngest students seated up front: A can of food he might have given to a homeless person, a set of Rosary beads he might have prayed with.",
      "The message landed.",
      "\u201cHe fed the poor, he cared for the poor,\u201d said 9-year-old David Cameron, who called Acutis \u201ca great man.\u201d Cameron, a fan of Sonic, Minecraft and Halo, also found inspiration in Acutis' love of video games, and awe at his restraint.",

      "India\u2019s clean energy appetite is helping the country\u2019s solar power industry wean itself off imported Chinese parts and continue growing even as it faces a tougher sell to its biggest foreign customer, the United States",
      "JAIPUR, India -- On the edge of Jaipur, an Indian city known for its colorful bazaars and palaces, a bustling industrial complex is the epicenter of the country's push to compete with China in making components for solar technology.",
      "India, the world's most populous nation, is jockeying for market share against the global leader in solar in part by selling to its own citizens, which helps the country with its other goal: meeting growing domestic demand for electricity.",
      "In the government-subsidized zone that provides tax breaks, solar manufacturer ReNew's sprawling factory makes enough modules to produce 4 gigawatts of power each year \u2014 equivalent to the energy needed for approximately 2.5 million Indian homes. The 2-year-old facility that employs nearly 1,000 people serves as a symbol of the solar industry\u2019s momentum. India\u2019s capacity to build key solar components more than doubled in the fiscal year ending in March.",
      "\u201cWhen I got this opportunity, I was really happy that I was directly contributing to the clean energy transition,\u201d said Monisha, an engineer at ReNew who goes by one name. She said the work has helped her become independent and assist her family with their finances.",
      "The country still faces a steep climb in its efforts to develop solar manufacturing that could one day rival China, which makes more than 80% of all solar components in the world and supplies key materials to Indian manufacturers.",
      "India's solar industry must also contend with a tougher sell to its biggest foreign customer, the United States. President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs of 50% on Indian goods took effect last month, while Trump\u2019s administration and Republican lawmakers have taken other steps to hinder U.S. adoption of solar and other clean energy.",
      "Still, India's clean energy appetite is helping its solar manufacturers deal with the external pressures. Energy analysts said India's domestic demand for solar power will likely reduce disruption from tariffs imposed by the U.S., where about a third of the solar panels produced by India were sold in a recent fiscal year. Proceeds from selling in the lucrative U.S. market have helped Indian solar manufacturers update their supply chains in recent years so they were less dependent on imported Chinese parts and materials.",
      "While Indian solar manufacturers can sell at higher prices abroad, ambitious domestic clean energy targets and domestic demand will help them find buyers within India if sales in the U.S. slow, analysts said.",
      "\u201cThis is a huge industry that can absorb these modules and cells that are being produced. We are not necessarily as export dependent as other countries are,\u201d said Charith Konda, an energy analyst at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis.",
      "India's domestic solar market has already helped Hyderabad-based Vega Solar shift its customer base for off-grid solar modules for RVs, electric fences and other uses to customers in India in the years since the COVID-19 pandemic, said Vinay Keesara, a company director.",
      "\u201cBefore the pandemic, 90% of my business was exports and 10% used to be domestic supply, now this has just flipped the other way around,\u201d he said.",
      "One of the most carbon-polluting countries, India is making huge efforts to harness the power of the sun and other clean energy sources. The cost of solar power \u2014 now half that of new coal-powered plants \u2014 and India's many sunny days are reasons that experts said installed solar power increased 30 times in the last decade.",
      "Before the U.S. tariffs were announced, researchers with IEEFA and Gurugram, India-based JMK Research wrote that India's demand for solar modules during the next two years could exceed what its manufacturers are selling within the country because so many are being exported. India has also been importing solar modules from China.",
      "Konda said it was too early to determine how the U.S. tariffs will affect Indian solar manufacturers, but that the impact won\u2019t be felt for at least another year because solar component orders are placed well in advance. And uncertainty remains over the fate of all of Trump's tariffs. Despite a U.S. court ruling against Trump\u2019s tariffs, they remain in place until at least October while his administration files appeals.",
      "India has nearly 170 gigawatts of renewable energy projects in the pipeline \u2014 most of which are solar \u2014 and are expected to be completed in the next few years. The country also has an ambitious clean energy target of 500 gigawatts by 2030.",
      "Government policies restricting imports of solar components, incentives for solar manufacturers and mandates for solar power producers to purchase material from government-approved sources gave Indian companies the right signals to ramp up solar manufacturing, said Sanjay Verghese, ReNew\u2019s group president for solar manufacturing and solar projects.",

      "India still depends on imports of raw materials as well as finished solar components from China but is making progress on reducing its reliance. Government data showed India imported $1.3 billion worth of solar cells and modules from China in the first quarter of the year, down by more than one-third from the same period a year earlier. Cells are individual units that convert sunlight into energy, while modules are made up of multiple cells.",
      "Neshwin Rodrigues, an analyst at climate energy think tank Ember, predicted that by 2030, India might be in a position of needing to import only the raw material polysilicon while producing other solar panel ingredients in the country.",
      "According to India\u2019s renewable energy ministry, the country\u2019s solar module manufacturing capacity more than doubled to 74 gigawatts over the fiscal year ending March 2025. Solar cell manufacturing tripled in the same period, from 9 gigawatts to 25 gigawatts.",

    "story": [
      "The Ukrainian government has declared that a branch of the Orthodox Church has failed to sever all ties with Moscow \u2014 and could soon be banned",
      "The Ukrainian government has declared that a branch of the Orthodox Church has failed to sever its longstanding ties with Moscow \u2014 and could soon be banned.",
      "The looming ban affects one of the two rival branches of Orthodoxy in the country and further underscores the turbulent role of religion as Ukraine fends off the Russian invasion. Orthodoxy is the majority religion in both Russia and Ukraine and has served as a cultural and spiritual battleground in tandem with the wider war.",
      "The action comes a year after the Ukrainian Parliament passed a law banning the Moscow-based Russian Orthodox Church due to its strong support of the Russian invasion of Ukraine.",
      "The law also authorized banning any organization tied to the Russian church. A government investigation into the Ukrainian Orthodox Church, with its centuries-old ties to Moscow, soon followed.",
      "The UOC denounced the full-blown Russian invasion from the start in 2022. It declared its independence from the Moscow church the same year and reiterated that stance in 2025.",
      "Even so, the government says the UOC has refused to take necessary steps, such as revising its governing documents, to complete that separation.",
      "The Aug. 27 government action, while long in the works, still requires more legal processes to take full effect.",
      "The government has petitioned a court to ban the activities of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church itself. The church, if it loses, would have the right to one appeal to a higher court before the case is finalized \u2014 a process that could be completed in months, its lawyer said.",
      "The finding that the UOC is Moscow-linked was published by the State Service of Ukraine on Ethnopolitics and Freedom of Conscience, a government entity known by its Ukrainian-language acronym DESS.",
      "Under the law, some UOC congregations could also find themselves barred from using property they don\u2019t own \u2014 a significant issue in a country where the state owns and leases out many historic church sites.",
      "The order specifically targets the \u201cKyiv Metropolis\u201d of the UOC \u2014 which is essentially the governing center. It is led by Metropolitan Onufry, a bishop whose citizenship Ukraine has already revoked. Under the law, UOC-related entities such as monasteries and regional eparchies (comparable to dioceses) could face similar sanctions.",
      "The UOC declared in 2022 that it was independent from Moscow and began taking ritually potent steps to underscore that split, such as refusing to commemorate Moscow Patriarch Kirill in its liturgies. Kirill is an avid supporter of the Russian invasion. He presided over a 2024 council that called it a holy war.",
      "Earlier this year, the DESS called on the UOC to take further steps to show its complete separation from Moscow. That included any documentation that it objected to the Russian church taking control of the UOC\u2019s churches in Russian-occupied territories.",
      "Onufry refused, saying the UOC\u2019s earlier declarations of independence were adequate.",
      "The government disagreed.",
      "\u201cThis is not a religious organization, but a branch of an aggressor state,\u201d asserted a headline on the DESS website.",

      "He accused the government of a politically motived effort \u201cto rid the country of independent institutions.\u201d",
      "Separately, the government has undertaken criminal proceedings against numerous individual UOC clerics, accusing them of collaborating with Russia or similar charges.",
      "About 70% of Ukrainians are Orthodox, according to a 2024 survey by the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology.",
      "Only a small number of them identified with the UOC, although the survey described it as part of the Moscow Patriarchate, a label it disputes. The UOC still operates many parishes and monasteries in Ukraine.",
      "Most of the Orthodox surveyed said they identified with a rival jurisdiction, the similarly named Orthodox Church of Ukraine. It received recognition as an independent church in 2019 from Patriarch Bartholomew of Constantinople.",
      "Although Bartholomew is considered first among equals among Orthodox patriarchs, he lacks the Catholic Church's papal-like authority. Moscow has furiously disputed his right to recognize a church on what it considers its territory. Russian leaders have even cited this schism, and the U.S. support for the new church, as helping provoke the current war.",
      "The head of the DESS, Viktor Yelensky, said in a news conference Tuesday that individual parishes could make their own decisions about affiliation. He said the action is not about religious doctrine but about affiliation with an aggressor state. \u201cNobody has asked them to refuse their religious beliefs,\u201d he said.",
      "The long-simmering dispute over the UOC has played a role in debates over U.S. aid to Ukraine, particularly with the new administration of President Donald Trump taking a more skeptical view toward such aid. Opponents of aiding Ukraine have accused it of repressing religious freedom.",

      "Rainfall long has fascinated the people of the United Arab Emirates, a desert nation on the Arabian Peninsula",
      "MASAFI, United Arab Emirates -- Outside of a mountain village in the northern outskirts of the United Arab Emirates, clouds on a recent weekend suddenly crowded out the white-hot sun that bakes this desert nation in the summer months. Fierce winds blew over planters and pushed a dumpster down the street. And then came the most infrequent visitor of all: rain.",
      "Rainfall long has fascinated the people of the Emirates. That includes both its white-thobed locals crowding into the deserts for any downpour and its vast population of foreign workers, many coming from homes in the Indian subcontinent who grew up with monsoon deluges.",
      "But rain also carries with it promise and peril to the nation of seven sheikhdoms on the Arabian Peninsula.",
      "With some 4 million people now estimated to be living in Dubai alone compared to around 255,000 in 1980, pressure on water consumption continues. Meanwhile, as weather patterns change with global warming, the country saw the heaviest recorded rainfall ever last year that disrupted worldwide travel and now has its leaders reconsidering how to build as residents nervously look to the skies.",
      "\u201cOut here, rain is almost like a firework event,\u201d said Howard Townsend, an unofficial weather forecaster in Dubai with a Facebook following. \u201cIt\u2019s too hot to go outside. When you get a rain event, it\u2019s like a blessing, a release.\u201d",
      "The UAE, home to an estimated 10 million people in total, sits along both the Persian Gulf to its north and west and the Gulf of Oman to the east. The stone Hajar Mountains separate it from neighboring Oman. Along the southern borders of the peninsula, monsoon rains can hit seaside areas of Oman and Yemen. But the vast desert stretch of the peninsula, known as the Empty Quarter, has a weather pattern that keeps the clouds out.",
      "That means little to no rain, sometimes for years at a time in some areas. For the Emirates, that has meant relying heavily on some 70 water desalination plants to supply drinking water, as well as drip irrigation for plants that can rely on recycled wastewater. Dams have also been built in recent years to catch and store water runoff.",
      "Even then, the UAE ranks seventh worldwide for being at risk for water scarcity, according to the World Resources Institute. Groundwater reservoirs have been known to be under pressure for years. The UAE also has been \u201ccloud seeding\u201d for years, flying aircraft to release chemicals into clouds to try to induce rains.",
      "\u201cWater is more important than oil,\u201d Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the leader of the UAE and ruler of Abu Dhabi, reportedly said back in 2011.",
      "That's particularly true in Dubai, where its booming population strains its roadways. The government-owned utility, the Dubai Electricity and Water Authority, reported producing 683.7 billion liters (180.6 billion gallons) of water last year alone through desalination, with water demand continuing to grow alongside the city-state.",
      "Yet Emirati government statistics suggest residents use around 550 liters (145 gallons) of water per day, which is among some of the highest usage around the world.",
      "But for all the fascination with rain, there's fear now as well for many after the April 2024 floods that swept across Dubai. In one day, more rain fell than ever recorded since 1949, when the officials in what became the UAE first began taking statistics.",
      "More than 142 millimeters (5.59 inches) of rainfall had soaked Dubai over 24 hours. An average year sees 94.7 millimeters (3.73 inches) of rain at Dubai International Airport, the world's busiest for international travel.",

      "\u201cIt\u2019s not a question of has the rain increased; it\u2019s where has the rain to go?\u201d Townsend said, something he called an increasingly pressing concern as Dubai builds further out into its desert outskirts.",

      "Dubai's ruler Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum also announced an $8 billion plan to build a massive rainwater drainage system for the city using underground tunneling equipment.",

      "The protest led by university students came more than 10 months after a concrete canopy collapsed at a train station in the town of Novi Sad, killing 16 people. The disaster ignited a wave of public outrage over alleged state corruption and negligence, which demonstrators cite as causes of the collapse.",
      "There were no immediate reports of injuries in Friday's chaos triggered by the police action. Ambulances could be seen driving through Novi Sad's streets. Police ordered that some of the protesters, including journalists, lay flat down on the street in handcuffs as police demanded they identify themselves.",

      "MAEBASHI, Japan -- Kokichi Akuzawa almost gave up during his trek to became the oldest person to summit Mount Fuji at age 102, an achievement recognized by Guinness World Records after he reached the top in early August.",
      "\u201cI was really tempted to give up halfway through,\u201d Akuzawa told The Associated Press in a recent interview. \u201cReaching the summit was tough, but my friends encouraged me, and it turned out well. I managed to get through it because so many people supported me.\u201d",
      "Akuzawa climbed with his 70-year-old daughter Motoe, his granddaughter, her husband and four friends from a local mountain climbing club.",
      "The climbing party camped for two nights on the trail before their Aug. 5 ascent to the top of Japan\u2019s tallest mountain, which peaks at 3,776 meters (12,388 feet).",
      "\u201cI\u2019m impressed I climbed so well,\u201d he said, communicating with the help of his 75-year-old daughter Yukiko, who repeated questions into her father\u2019s ear because he is hard of hearing. Akuzawa added that he doesn\u2019t take any mountain for granted at his age. \u201cIt\u2019s better to climb while you still can.\u201d",
      "The trip was not Akuzawa\u2019s first record-breaking ascent up Mount Fuji. He was 96 the first time he became the oldest person to scale the country's most famous mountain. In the six years since, he overcame heart issues, shingles and stitches from a climbing fall.",
      "Akuzawa spent three months training before the Fuji climb, waking at 5 a.m. for hour-long walks and tackling roughly one mountain each week, mostly around Nagano prefecture to the west of Gunma in central Japan.",
      "Surrounded by relatives and framed paintings of mountains in his home in Maebashi, about 241 kilometers (150 miles) northwest of Tokyo, Akuzawa recalls what first drew him to the mountains 88 years ago. While the magic of reaching the summit is undeniable, it was the people who kept him coming back.",
      "\u201cI climb because I like it,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to make friends on the mountain.\u201d",
      "Akuzawa was a capable student and worked as an engine design engineer and later as a livestock artificial inseminator, a profession he held until age 85, his family said.",
      "\u201cWhether you liked studying or not, you could enjoy the mountain just the same,\u201d he said. \u201cIntelligence didn\u2019t matter up there. We were all on equal footing and moved forward together.\u201d",

      "\u201cMount Fuji isn\u2019t a difficult mountain, but this time was harder than six years ago. Harder than any mountain before,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve never felt this weak. I didn\u2019t have pain, but I kept wondering why I was so slow, why I had no stamina. I\u2019d long since passed my physical limit, and it was only thanks to everyone else\u2019s strength that I made it.\u201d",

      "Enes Hocaogullari, who took part in a March meeting of the Council of Europe in Strasbourg, France, as one of Turkey\u2019s youth delegates, was arrested last month after he criticized the detention of Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu and other opposition figures.",

      "Marc Cools, president of a delegation of the Council of Europe\u2019s local and regional authorities congress, said there was no legal justification for Hocaogullari\u2019s prosecution or detention.",
      "\u201cSilencing Enes is silencing youth \u2014 and silencing youth is silencing democracy itself,\u201d Cools said after visiting Hocaogullari in prison Friday and meeting a day earlier with Turkey\u2019s deputy justice minister and other officials in Ankara.",
      "Hocaogullari was taken into custody at Ankara\u2019s Esenboga airport in August and later charged with \u201cpublicly disseminating misleading information\u201d and \u201cinciting hatred and enmity among the public.\u201d",

      "ABTAA, Syria -- The classrooms at a school building in Abtaa, in Syria\u2019s southern province of Daraa, have turned into living quarters housing three or four families each. Because of the lack of privacy and close quarters, the woman and children sleep inside, with the men bedding down outside in the courtyard.",
      "The Bedouin families evacuated their villages during sectarian fighting more than a month ago in neighboring Sweida province. Since then, the central government in Damascus has been in a standoff with local Druze authorities in Sweida, while the displaced have been left in a state of limbo.",
      "Munira al-Hamad, a 56-year-old from the village of al-Kafr in the Sweida countryside, is staying with her family in the school, which is set to reopen this month. If that happens, she doesn\u2019t know where her family will go.",

      "What began last month with small-scale clashes between local Sunni Muslim Bedouin clans and members of the Druze sect \u2014 who are a minority in Syria but the majority in Sweida \u2014 escalated into heavy fighting between Bedouins and government fighters on one side and Druze armed groups on the other. Israel intervened on the side of the Druze, launching airstrikes.",
      "Hundreds of civilians, mostly Druze, were killed and Sweida has remained under what residents describe as a siege since then, with limited aid and supplies going in. Amnesty International reported this week that it had documented 46 cases of \u201cDruze men and women deliberately and unlawfully killed,\u201d in some cases by \u201cgovernment and government-affiliated forces in military and security uniforms.\u201d",
      "Although the fighting has subsided, more than 164,000 people remain displaced by the conflict, according to U.N. figures.",

      "Al-Hamad said her family \u201cremained under siege for 15 days, without bread or anything coming in\u201d before the Syrian Arab Red Crescent evacuated them. Her cousin and a neighbor were attacked by armed men as they fled and had their cars stolen with all the belongings they were transporting, she said.",
      "Jarrah al-Mohammad, 24, said dozens of residents trekked overnight on foot to escape when the fighting reached their village, Sahwat Balata. Nine people from the area were gunned down by Druze militants, including three children under the age of 15, all of them unarmed, he said. The Associated Press could not independently verify the account.",
      "\u201cNo one has gone back. There are houses that they burned and destroyed and stole the furniture,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can\u2019t return to Sweida \u2014 there\u2019s no longer security between us and the Druze \u2026 And we\u2019re the minority in Sweida.\u201d",

      "Government officials have insisted that the displacement is temporary, but have not offered any \u201cclarity on for how long people will be displaced, what are the mechanisms or plans or strategies that they have in order to bring them back,\u201d said Haid Haid, a senior research fellow at the Arab Reform Initiative and the Chatham House think tank.",

The two communities have largely coexisted, but there have been periodic tensions and violence.",
      "In 2000, a Bedouin killed a Druze man in a land dispute and government forces intervened, shooting Druze protesters. After a 2018 Islamic State group attack on the Druze in Sweida that killed more than 200 people, the Druze accused the Bedouins of helping the militants.",

      "Safi had built a 10-room house from mud and stone because wood and cement were too expensive and impractical to transport. The home collapsed as soon as a major earthquake that killed at least 2,000 people struck on Aug. 31. His shock was quickly replaced by fear and panic.",

      "It is now more strictly regulated for medical purposes, but its future is unclear.",
      "An amendment to the Narcotics Law in 2022 dropped cannabis from the list of controlled drugs. The effort was led by then-Health Minister Anutin Charnvirakul, head of the Bhumjaithai Party, which made legal cannabis a major part of its campaign platform in the 2019 general election. The party\u2019s stronghold is in the poor northeastern region, where it promised farmers that cannabis would be a new cash crop.",
      "Thailand\u2019s cannabis industry grew at lightning speed, with thousands of weed dispensaries opening all over the country. It also drew a wave of tourists, especially from within the region, where many countries still impose tough laws on cannabis offenses.",

      "The government led by the Pheu Thai Party, which took power a year after decriminalization, had pledged to make cannabis illegal again, but for years moved slowly on its promises as it faced strong resistance from Bhumjaithai, which then was one of its main coalition partners. Pheu Thai's moves were also criticized by advocates and entrepreneurs as confusing and politically motivated.",
      "Pheu Thai finally moved to tighten regulations on the use of cannabis in June. The new order bans shops from selling cannabis to customers without a prescription and reclassifies cannabis buds as a controlled herb. Sellers that violate the order could face a maximum one-year jail term and a fine of 20,000 baht ($614).",
      "The Department of Thai Traditional and Alternative Medicine, which is in charge of enforcing regulations on cannabis, said in September that a dispensary can sell a limited amount of cannabis for personal use to patients who have a prescription for one of five conditions: insomnia, chronic pain, migraines, Parkinson\u2019s disease and loss of appetite.",

      "Cork comes from the spongy bark of the cork oak tree, which is primarily grown and harvested in the Mediterranean basin. The framework trade agreement between the United States and the European Union singled out the material as an \u201cunavailable natural product.\u201d So as of Sept. 1, cork joined a handful of other items, including airplanes and generic pharmaceuticals, that are exempt from a 15% U.S. tariff on most EU products.",
      "The cork carve-out was vital for Portugal. The European country is the world\u2019s largest cork producer, accounting for about half of global production.",
      "Portuguese diplomats lobbied for the exemption on both sides of the Atlantic. Patrick Spencer, the executive director of the U.S.-based Natural Cork Council, raced from Salem, Oregon, to Washington in June to explain cork\u2019s origins to U.S. trade officials and to seek a tariff reprieve. The Wine Institute, which represents California vintners, said it also pushed for the special dispensation.",
      "Spencer said he was thrilled when a summary of the U.S.-EU agreement released in August mentioned cork.",
      "\u201cIt was a great day in our neighborhood,\u201d said Spencer, a self-described \u201ccork dork.\"",
      "It\u2019s unclear if cork is unique or if other natural products will be exempt from U.S. tariffs in future trade agreements. The U.S. Department of Commerce and the White House did not respond when The Associated Press asked about tariff exemptions.",
      "It\u2019s not even clear if the tariffs President Donald Trump put on imports from the EU's 27 member nations and almost every country will remain. Late last month, a U.S. appeals court ruled that Trump had no right to impose his sweeping tariffs, although it left them in place while his administration appeals to the U.S. Supreme Court.",
      "But if the tariffs stay in place, cork may signal other exemptions to come. U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick indicated during a July interview with CNBC that natural products like mangoes or cocoa may be free from tariffs",
      "The U.S. is the second-largest market for Portuguese cork after France. In 2023, the U.S. imported $241 million worth of cork from Portugal; just over 70% of it came in the form of stoppers for wine, spirits, olive oil, honey and other liquids, according to the Natural Cork Council, a trade group.",
      "Cork has other applications, too. NASA and SpaceX have used it for thermal protection on rockets. Cork crumbles are also used as infill for sports fields and inserted into concrete on airport runways to help absorb the shock of plane landings.",
      "Even though California has a similar climate to the Mediterranean, the U.S. has never developed a cork industry. There was an attempt to start one during World War II, and around 500 cork oaks from that period remain on the campus of the University of California, Davis.",
      "But the effort evaporated when the war ended. The problem: it takes 25 years for a cork tree to produce its first bark for harvesting, and the initial yield typically isn\u2019t high quality. After that, it takes the tree about nine years to grow new bark.",
      "\u201cAmericans are not patient enough to wait for a tree that takes 25 years to give its first harvest,\u201d said Antonio Amorim, the chairman and CEO of Portugal\u2019s Corticeira Amorim, one of the world\u2019s largest cork companies.",

      "On a recent day at Amorim\u2019s Herdade de Rio Frio, a farm 40 kilometers (25 miles) southeast of Lisbon, crews zig-zagged across the thin, pale grass between scattered cork trees, kicking up dust.",
      "The quiet woodland echoed with the gentle thud of the workers\u2019 axes. They gently pierced the bark, feeling for the thickness of cork that could be peeled off without harming the trunk. The Portuguese have harvested cork this way for more than 200 years.",
      "The tree bark came off in featherweight slabs that the workers, their hands black from the oaks' natural tannins, tossed onto a flatbed truck. It would go to factories to be cut into strips and fed into a machine that punches out stoppers.",
      "Once the trees were bare, a woman painted a white \u201c5\u201d on the orange-colored trunks, signaling they were stripped in 2025. Herdade de Rio Frio's cork oaks, which are native to Portugal and can resist frequent droughts and scorching summer temperatures, were planted more than 100 years ago.",
      "Cork\u2019s sustainable harvesting process and its biodegradability are two reasons many U.S. winemakers have returned to plugging bottles with it after experimenting with closures made of aluminum, plastic and glass. In 2010, 53% of premium U.S. wines used cork stoppers; by 2022, that had risen to 64.5%, according to the Natural Cork Council.",
      "Cork taint, which gives wine a funky taste and is caused by a fungus in natural corks, was a big problem in the 1990s, and it pushed many vintners into aluminum screw caps and other closures, said Andrew Waterhouse, a chemist and director of the Robert Mondavi Institute of Wine and Food Science at the University of California, Davis.",
      "The cork industry has largely solved that problem, Waterhouse said. In the meantime, the wine industry came up with new technology, like screw caps that can mimic cork in the amount of oxygen they let into a bottle over time.",
      "Many wineries, including Trump Winery in Virginia, now use both screw caps and natural corks. Waterhouse said screw caps generally make more sense for a wine like ros\u00e9, which isn\u2019t intended to age, while cork is the standard for aging wines.",
      "\u201cIf you say, \u2018Has this wine aged properly?,\u2019 what you mean is, \u2018Was it in a glass bottle with a cork seal in a cool cellar?\u2019 Under any other conditions, it didn\u2019t age the same,\u201d Waterhouse said. \u201cWe\u2019re always trapped by history.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Fox News seemed to be dealt a crippling blow in a $787 million settlement of a libel lawsuit more than two years ago, but has instead thrived",
      "NEW YORK -- Twice recently, the people who run Fox News were reminded of their biggest nightmare.",
      "The conservative network Newsmax's $67 million settlement with Dominion Voting Systems over false claims after the 2020 election recalled Fox's own $787.5 million deal with the same company more than two years ago. New legal papers filed last month by a second company suing Fox, Smartmatic, also put an episode they would like to forget back in the news.",
      "Between the staggering payment to bypass a defamation trial and revelations about the lengths to which Fox went to avoid telling its audience what it didn't want to hear about Donald Trump's defeat, many wondered if its actions in November 2020 would damage Fox News or compel it to change directions.",
      "Not so much, it turns out.",
      "Fox News Channel has defied gravity with its ratings, and is more popular with viewers this summer than ABC, CBS or NBC. Its top personalities resolutely support Trump, who has filled his second administration with former Fox stars like Pete Hegseth and Jeanine Pirro. Time after time, the White House turns to Fox to make news; shortly after meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin, Trump was sitting with Sean Hannity.",
      "Reached by The Associated Press, Fox declined to make anyone available to speak for this story.",
      "An ethos many at Fox share with the president \u2014 no expressed regrets, no apologies \u2014 has also shown signs of spreading, given Newsmax's swagger following the Aug. 11 settlement announcement.",
      "Fox News averaged 2.63 million viewers in weekday prime-time for the second quarter of 2025, up 56% from the same period in 2023, the Nielsen company said. While the increase is somewhat inflated since Fox took a hit in the ratings two years ago following the firing of Tucker Carlson, the advance of cord-cutting means that any network gaining viewers now is unusual.",
      "MSNBC's prime-time audience of 1 million this spring was down 21% in two years, and CNN's viewership of 538,000 was down 6%, Nielsen said. Forty-five percent of people watching one of the top three cable news networks at any given time two years ago were tuned to Fox. This year, that audience share jumped to 62%.",
      "Clearly, Fox's audience is more interested in following a Trump administration than it was for a Joe Biden administration. Just as clearly, the Dominion case had little appreciable impact on viewership.",
      "\u201cFox's audience didn't really look at that verdict and say, \u2018Oh, I can\u2019t watch them anymore,'\u201d said Tim Graham, director of media analysis at the conservative Media Research Center. \u201cI think Fox's audience looked at that and said, \u2018oh, the left is coming after them.\u2019\u201d",
      "Financially, the Dominion settlement was stiff enough that Newsmax is spreading its payments out over three years. The much larger Fox had a greater ability to absorb its hit. Fox confirmed at the time that it could deduct the settlement from its income taxes, and insurance could make the payment lower. Meanwhile, Fox News is a profit engine and becoming even more so; Axios reported earlier this year that the company expected to make half a billion dollars on non-TV products like books, podcasts and streaming.",
      "Carlson was the face of the network before he was fired shortly after the settlement was announced, but Fox has always been able to generate new stars. Carlson took over from Bill O'Reilly when he was fired in 2017. Fox started \u201cThe Five,\u201d arguably its centerpiece show, when Glenn Beck was shown the door in 2011. Jesse Watters now owns Carlson and O'Reilly's old time slot.",
      "Yet, it's hard to understate the worry many at Fox had about losing audience immediately following the 2020 election. Trump, and many of his fans, were angry that the network declared Biden the winner in Arizona before most news outlets, a pivotal moment in the vote-counting.",
      "Internal messages and deposition interviews revealed in court papers tied to Smartmatic's lawsuit reveal much of that drama. Management criticized anchor Neil Cavuto for ordering his show to cut away from Trump press secretary Kayleigh McEnany when she began talking about election fraud. News reporters were disciplined for fact-checking some of Trump's claims. Many in Fox's audience expressed anger at hearing Trump corrected and wanted to hear conspiracy theories.",
      "Cavuto left Fox after 28 years last December. McEnany is now a co-host of Fox's midday show, \u201cOutnumbered.\u201d Trump's daughter-in-law, Lara Trump, hosts a weekend show at Fox.",

      "Former Fox politics editor Chris Stirewalt, who was fired by Fox shortly after the network's correct call in Arizona, identified in a Smartmatic deposition a programming strategy that Fox excels at. \u201cThe best way to capture an audience is to make them afraid, make them fearful of something \u2014 to make them hate or resent other people to try to keep them with your telecast and that they're afraid to change the channel,\u201d he said.",
      "Fox has also maintained its dominance by playing a form of hardball that Newsmax alleged, in a lawsuit filed this week, violates antitrust laws. Newsmax said Fox has tried to block television distributors from carrying its rival, hired private detectives to investigate Newsmax executives and pressured guests not to appear on the network.",
      "In response, Fox said, \u201cNewsmax cannot sue their way out of their own competitive failures in the marketplace to chase headlines simply because they can't attract viewers.\u201d",
      "Smartmatic said Fox has never retracted, or apologized for, programs that falsely suggested the company was involved in changing votes in 2020. Fox, which would not make an executive available for this story, said fraud charges made by a president or his representatives were newsworthy, and the network is defending itself on free speech grounds.",
      "Newsmax has twice publicly expressed some regrets about its postelection coverage. The network settled a lawsuit with Smartmatic in 2024.",
      "In a statement aired on Newsmax in December 2020, the network said that \u201cno evidence has been offered that Dominion or Smartmatic used software or reprogrammed software that manipulated votes in the 2020 election.\u201d The following April, Newsmax apologized for airing false allegations that a Dominion employee, Eric Coomer, manipulated voting machines or tallies to the detriment of Trump in 2020. Coomer, in turn, dropped Newsmax from a defamation lawsuit.",
      "According to court papers in the case, Newsmax executive Gary Kanofsky wrote about conspiracy theorists to a colleague shortly after the election: \u201cSimply giving them a microphone to spew more anti-election rhetoric and advance their claims without being properly equipped to question the legitimacy or factual accuracy of their assertions may be fun, but it\u2019s terrible journalism.\u201d",
      "But Newsmax offered no apology in making the Dominion settlement, announced Aug. 11. The network's CEO, Chris Ruddy, attacked the judge, saying he \u201ceffectively entered a confiscation of our property because our reporting was not always sympathetic to Joe Biden.\u201d",
      "The network said on the air: \u201cNewsmax believed it was critically important for the American people to hear both sides of the election disputes that arose in 2020. We stand by our coverage as fair, balanced and conducted within professional standards of journalism.\u201d",
      "What has changed? Newsmax has grown, and two months after Trump took office again, it went public. It invites members of its audience \u2014 dominated by Trump fans \u2014 to invest in the network.",
      "\u201cIf you're paying attention to your audience at Newsmax,\u201d Graham said, \u201cyou don't want to give the impression that you're knuckling under.\u201d",

      "India\u2019s clean energy appetite is helping the country\u2019s solar power industry wean itself off imported Chinese parts and continue growing even as it faces a tougher sell to its biggest foreign customer, the United States",
      "JAIPUR, India -- On the edge of Jaipur, an Indian city known for its colorful bazaars and palaces, a bustling industrial complex is the epicenter of the country's push to compete with China in making components for solar technology.",
      "India, the world's most populous nation, is jockeying for market share against the global leader in solar in part by selling to its own citizens, which helps the country with its other goal: meeting growing domestic demand for electricity.",
      "In the government-subsidized zone that provides tax breaks, solar manufacturer ReNew's sprawling factory makes enough modules to produce 4 gigawatts of power each year \u2014 equivalent to the energy needed for approximately 2.5 million Indian homes. The 2-year-old facility that employs nearly 1,000 people serves as a symbol of the solar industry\u2019s momentum. India\u2019s capacity to build key solar components more than doubled in the fiscal year ending in March.",
      "\u201cWhen I got this opportunity, I was really happy that I was directly contributing to the clean energy transition,\u201d said Monisha, an engineer at ReNew who goes by one name. She said the work has helped her become independent and assist her family with their finances.",
      "The country still faces a steep climb in its efforts to develop solar manufacturing that could one day rival China, which makes more than 80% of all solar components in the world and supplies key materials to Indian manufacturers.",
      "India's solar industry must also contend with a tougher sell to its biggest foreign customer, the United States. President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs of 50% on Indian goods took effect last month, while Trump\u2019s administration and Republican lawmakers have taken other steps to hinder U.S. adoption of solar and other clean energy.",
      "Still, India's clean energy appetite is helping its solar manufacturers deal with the external pressures. Energy analysts said India's domestic demand for solar power will likely reduce disruption from tariffs imposed by the U.S., where about a third of the solar panels produced by India were sold in a recent fiscal year. Proceeds from selling in the lucrative U.S. market have helped Indian solar manufacturers update their supply chains in recent years so they were less dependent on imported Chinese parts and materials.",
      "While Indian solar manufacturers can sell at higher prices abroad, ambitious domestic clean energy targets and domestic demand will help them find buyers within India if sales in the U.S. slow, analysts said.",
      "\u201cThis is a huge industry that can absorb these modules and cells that are being produced. We are not necessarily as export dependent as other countries are,\u201d said Charith Konda, an energy analyst at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis.",
      "India's domestic solar market has already helped Hyderabad-based Vega Solar shift its customer base for off-grid solar modules for RVs, electric fences and other uses to customers in India in the years since the COVID-19 pandemic, said Vinay Keesara, a company director.",
      "\u201cBefore the pandemic, 90% of my business was exports and 10% used to be domestic supply, now this has just flipped the other way around,\u201d he said.",
      "One of the most carbon-polluting countries, India is making huge efforts to harness the power of the sun and other clean energy sources. The cost of solar power \u2014 now half that of new coal-powered plants \u2014 and India's many sunny days are reasons that experts said installed solar power increased 30 times in the last decade.",
      "Before the U.S. tariffs were announced, researchers with IEEFA and Gurugram, India-based JMK Research wrote that India's demand for solar modules during the next two years could exceed what its manufacturers are selling within the country because so many are being exported. India has also been importing solar modules from China.",
      "Konda said it was too early to determine how the U.S. tariffs will affect Indian solar manufacturers, but that the impact won\u2019t be felt for at least another year because solar component orders are placed well in advance. And uncertainty remains over the fate of all of Trump's tariffs. Despite a U.S. court ruling against Trump\u2019s tariffs, they remain in place until at least October while his administration files appeals.",
      "India has nearly 170 gigawatts of renewable energy projects in the pipeline \u2014 most of which are solar \u2014 and are expected to be completed in the next few years. The country also has an ambitious clean energy target of 500 gigawatts by 2030.",
      "Government policies restricting imports of solar components, incentives for solar manufacturers and mandates for solar power producers to purchase material from government-approved sources gave Indian companies the right signals to ramp up solar manufacturing, said Sanjay Verghese, ReNew\u2019s group president for solar manufacturing and solar projects.",

Government data showed India imported $1.3 billion worth of solar cells and modules from China in the first quarter of the year, down by more than one-third from the same period a year earlier. Cells are individual units that convert sunlight into energy, while modules are made up of multiple cells.",
      "Neshwin Rodrigues, an analyst at climate energy think tank Ember, predicted that by 2030, India might be in a position of needing to import only the raw material polysilicon while producing other solar panel ingredients in the country.",

      "As the cost of electricity outpaces inflation, consumer advocates are sounding alarms about the risks to low-income people who can't afford consistent air conditioning in deadly heat",
      "NEW YORK -- As the cost of electricity outpaces inflation and summers grow deadlier, consumer advocates are sounding alarms about the risks to low-income people who can\u2019t afford consistent air conditioning in dangerous temperatures.",
      "While about half of U.S. states offer protections from utility shutoffs during extreme heat, the rest do not. In contrast, 41 states have \u201ccold weather rules,\u201d which forbid utility companies from shutting off household heat during extreme cold. The Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) provides funds for vulnerable groups who have trouble affording heating bills in the winter, but the program has less funding available to meet consumers' increasing needs in the summer months.",
      "Shylee Johnson, 27, based in Wichita, Kansas, saw firsthand the protection that the local Low Income Energy Assistance Program (LIEAP) brought to her community during the three years she worked as a case manager for families who were behind on utility bills.",
      "\u201cIt was amazing at keeping people's electricity on in the winter,\u201d she said of the program, which subsidizes costs for households who can't afford utility expenses. \u201cFamilies would be deciding between paying their heating bill or another bill, and this took that decision away.\u201d",
      "In the summer, though, Johnson said she's seen how late or missed utility payments can result in the shutoff of electricity and the removal of vital services, despite air conditioning becoming increasingly essential to families' health and well-being.",
      "\u201cIt's terrifying,\u201d she said. \u201cThere's a \u2018cold weather rule\u2019 \u2014 in freezing temperatures, your heat can't be turned off. But there isn't an equivalent for summer in Kansas.\"",
      "The clients Johnson served were often the most vulnerable, including families with young children, pregnant people, and those with sick or disabled family members, including some who need electricity to operate essential medical equipment in their homes. LIHEAP also sometimes provides air conditioning units in the summer for households that can't afford to purchase their own units.",
      "Recent studies show that extreme heat in the summer is now the leading cause of weather-related deaths, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). That's ahead of deaths due to extreme cold in the winter or other weather emergencies, like hurricanes or tornadoes. The frequency, duration and intensity of extreme heat waves has significantly increased over the past several decades, according to the EPA, and insignificant support for low-income households contributes to the danger.",
      "In 2023, the death certificates of more than 2,300 people who died in the summer mention the effects of excessive heat, the highest number in 45 years of records, according to an Associated Press analysis of Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data. And that figure is only a fraction of the real death toll, according to coroner, hospital, and ambulance records, also analyzed by the AP.",
      "Nationally, the cost of electricity has risen at twice the pace of the average cost of living, exacerbating the problem.",
      "According to the National Energy Assistance Directors Association (NEADA), which represents state program managers of LIHEAP, almost 20% of very low-income families lack consistent access to cooling. Currently, 26 states and the District of Columbia offer assistance with summer energy bills, while 21 states plus D.C. have policies protecting low-income families from utility disconnections during summer months.",
      "Still, roughly 85% of LIHEAP resources are used for heating in the winter, leaving little support for households seeking cooling, according to Mark Wolfe, executive director of NEADA.",

      "Karen Lusson, senior attorney at the National Consumer Law Center who focuses on energy and utility affordability, said that many deaths from extreme heat in the summer months are preventable.",
      "\u201cThe impression we\u2019ve all had is that weather is most dangerous in the wintertime,\u201d she said. \u201cNot any more.\u201d",
      "While the Trump administration fired the entire staff of the LIHEAP program in April, Wolfe and Lusson are hopeful Congress will approve slightly more funding for the program in the fall compared to the previous fiscal year, they said.",
      "To protect households during increasingly hotter summers, Lusson recommends individuals seek information about their rights when it comes to utility shutoffs. State utility commissions, which regulate public utilities, dictate local rules. To find your relevant commission, consult the government site operated by the national association of regulatory commissions, which has a state-by-state look-up tool.",
      "Lusson also encourages people to look into whether their state protections are calendar- or temperature-based, which can make a difference in planning. While some states forbid shut-offs during certain months of the year, others base the protections on the temperature of a given day or the presence of a heat advisory. This LIHEAP site has a break-down of every state's policies.",
      "Some state attorney generals' offices also have public utility bureaus that advocate on behalf of consumers, Lusson said.",
      "Lastly, it can be helpful to determine if your utility company offers discount rates or percentage-of-income payment plans to help with electricity bills. Both commission and utility websites have specific information about how to access LIHEAP assistance and whether or not the utility company itself offers assistance.",

      "The attorneys general of California and Delaware have expressed serious concerns about the safety of OpenAI's chatbot, ChatGPT, especially for children and teens",
      "The attorneys general of California and Delaware on Friday warned OpenAI they have \u201cserious concerns\u201d about the safety of its flagship chatbot, ChatGPT, especially for children and teens.",
      "The two state officials, who have unique powers to regulate nonprofits such as OpenAI, sent the letter to the company after a meeting with its legal team earlier this week in Wilmington, Delaware.",
      "California AG Rob Bonta and Delaware AG Kathleen Jennings have spent months reviewing OpenAI's plans to restructure its business, with an eye on \u201censuring rigorous and robust oversight of OpenAI\u2019s safety mission.\u201d",
      "But they said they were concerned by \u201cdeeply troubling reports of dangerous interactions between\" chatbots and their users, including the \"heartbreaking death by suicide of one young Californian after he had prolonged interactions with an OpenAI chatbot, as well as a similarly disturbing murder-suicide in Connecticut. Whatever safeguards were in place did not work.\u201d",
      "The parents of the 16-year-old boy, who died in April, sued OpenAI and its CEO, Sam Altman, last month.",
      "OpenAI didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment on Friday.",
      "Founded as a nonprofit with a safety-focused mission to build better-than-human artificial intelligence, OpenAI had recently sought to transfer more control to its for-profit arm from its nonprofit before dropping those plans in May after discussions with the offices of Bonta and Jennings and other nonprofit groups.",
      "The two elected officials, both Democrats, have oversight of any such changes because OpenAI is incorporated in Delaware and operates out of California, where it has its headquarters in San Francisco.",
      "After dropping its initial plans, OpenAI has been seeking the officials' approval for a \u201crecapitalization,\u201d in which the nonprofit\u2019s existing for-profit arm will convert into a public benefit corporation that has to consider the interests of both shareholders and the mission.",
      "Bonta and Jennings wrote Friday of their \u201cshared view\u201d that OpenAI and the industry need better safety measures.",
      "\u201cThe recent deaths are unacceptable,\u201d they wrote. \u201cThey have rightly shaken the American public\u2019s confidence in OpenAI and this industry. OpenAI \u2013 and the AI industry \u2013 must proactively and transparently ensure AI\u2019s safe deployment. Doing so is mandated by OpenAI\u2019s charitable mission, and will be required and enforced by our respective offices.\u201d",

      "NEW YORK -- Paul Colford, an inexhaustibly curious journalist and author who covered the media business for decades before seeing it from another vantage point as The Associated Press' chief spokesperson, has died. He was 71.",
      "Colford, who retired from the AP in 2017, died Aug. 26 after a fall the previous month turned a long struggle with Parkinson's disease into a rapid decline, said his wife, Anne LaBate. Despite his health problems, he was working even in recent months on his third book, about a notorious figure from his hometown of Jersey City, New Jersey.",
      "During a decade as AP's director and ultimately vice president of media relations, Colford was known for his sage, unflappable handling of the news cooperative's dealings with other media outlets, from requests for interviews with its journalists to inquiries about its practices.",
      "\u201cPaul was both graceful and tough and believed completely in the AP\u2019s journalists and their mission. That was important during some pretty tough moments, particularly when an AP journalist was hurt or worse,\" said Kathleen Carroll, who was the news service's executive editor from 2002 to 2016. She recalled Colford as \u201ca talented and classy colleague\u201d who loved journalism.",
      "Colford knew the media ecosystem from the inside out and the outside in, having been a media reporter and columnist for the Daily News of New York, Newsday and the former New York Newsday. He covered magazines, book publishing, newspapers' digital evolution and the new media of the dot-com era. Reporting on the radio landscape as conservative talk rose to prominence, Colford penned unauthorized biographies of Rush Limbaugh and shock jock Howard Stern.",
      "\u201cHe just was indefatigable,\u201d said longtime Newsday TV writer and critic Verne Gay, a colleague and friend of Colford's. \u201cHe vacuumed everything up. He knew everything and everybody. And he constantly broke stories on the beat.... I was just in awe of him.\"",
      "Born Sept. 24, 1953, in Jersey City, Colford grew up there with seven siblings and graduated in 1975 from St. Peter's University. He spent part of his college years studying in Turin, Italy, and still spoke Italian in phone calls with friends from that time, his wife said.",
      "His early jobs included a stint at The Courier News of central New Jersey, where the couple met and dated for a time in the 1970s. He took her to the first Shakespeare in the Park production she ever attended, she recalled.",
      "The relationship fizzled, Colford went on to New York Newsday and later the Daily News, and he married the late Jane Colford and had two children, Catherine and Liam. He and LaBate still had ties through friends and family, and they got back together after he was widowed.",
      "\u201cWe certainly both had lived whole lives\u201d in the meantime, she said, but \u201cit was probably even a clearer connection.\u201d They married in 2022.",
      "Colford's professional life also had evolved. He took the AP's media relations job in 2007.",

      "As editors debated, readers and viewers complained and other news outlets called for comment, Colford kept his cool and gave smart guidance about how best to react, said Kent, now a consultant. He said editors and executives ended up taking Colford's advice, which came with \u201ca journalistic sensitivity and ethical integrity that won the confidence and respect of journalists and editors across the AP.\u201d",
      "Lauren Easton, whom Colford hired in a junior role, is now an AP vice president overseeing global communications.

    "story": [
      "A midstage study of the psychedelic drug LSD showed positive results for easing symptoms in people with generalized anxiety disorder",
      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 LSD reduced symptoms of anxiety in a midstage study published Thursday, paving the way for additional testing and possible medical approval of a psychedelic drug that has been banned in the U.S. for more than a half century.",
      "The results from drugmaker Mindmed tested several doses of LSD in patients with moderate-to-severe generalized anxiety disorder, with the benefits lasting as long as three months. The company plans to conduct follow-up studies to confirm the results and then apply for Food and Drug Administration approval.",
      "Beginning in the 1950s, researchers published a flurry of papers exploring LSD's therapeutic uses, though most of them don't meet modern standards.",
      "\u201cI see this paper as a clear step in the direction of reviving that old research, applying our modern standards and determining what are the real costs and benefits of these compounds,\u201d said Frederick Barrett, who directs Johns Hopkins University\u2019s psychedelic center and was not involved in the research.",
      "Psychedelics are in the midst of a popular and scientific comeback, with conferences, documentaries, books and medical journals exploring their potential for conditions like depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder.",
      "The FDA has designated psilocybin, MDMA and now LSD as potential \u201cbreakthrough\u201d therapies based on early results.",
      "Still, the drugs have not had a glide path to the market.",
      "Last year, the FDA rejected MDMA \u2014 also known as ecstasy \u2014 as a treatment for PTSD, citing flawed study methods, potential research bias and other issues.",
      "The new LSD study, published by the Journal of the American Medical Association, addresses some of those problems.",
      "MDMA, like many other psychedelics, was tested in combination with hours of talk therapy by trained health professionals. That approach proved problematic for FDA reviewers, who said it was difficult to separate the benefits of the drug from those of therapy.",
      "The LSD study took a simpler approach: Patients got a single dose of LSD \u2014 under professional supervision, but without therapy \u2014 and then were followed for about three months.",
      "The paper does not detail how patients were prepared for the experience or what sort of follow-up they received, which is crucial to understanding the research, Barrett noted.",
      "\u201cIn many cases people can have such powerful, subjective experiences that they may need to talk to a therapist to help them make sense of it,\u201d he said.",
      "For the study, researchers measured anxiety symptoms in nearly 200 patients who randomly received one of four doses of LSD or a placebo. The main aim was to find the optimal dose of the drug, which can cause intense visual hallucinations and occasionally feelings of panic or paranoia.",
      "At four weeks, patients receiving the two highest doses had significantly lower anxiety scores than those who received placebo or lower doses. After 12 weeks, 65% of patients taking the most effective LSD dose \u2014 100 milligrams \u2014 continued to show benefits and nearly 50% were deemed to be in remission. The most common side effects included hallucinations, nausea and headaches.",
      "Patients who got dummy pills also improved \u2014 a common phenomenon in psychedelic and psychiatric studies \u2014 but their changes were less than half the size those getting the real drug.",

      "The research was not immune to problems seen in similar studies.",
      "Most patients were able to correctly guess whether they\u2019d received LSD or a dummy pill, undercutting the \u201cblinded\u201d approach that\u2019s considered critical to objectively establishing the benefits of a new medicine. In addition, a significant portion of patients in both the placebo and treatment groups dropped out early, narrowing the final data set.",
      "It also wasn\u2019t clear how long patients might continue to benefit.",
      "Mindmed is conducting two large, late-stage trials that will track patients over a longer period of time and, if successful, be submitted for FDA approval.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s possible that some people may need retreatment,\u201d said Dr. Maurizio Fava of Mass General Brigham Hospital, the study's lead author and an adviser to Mindmed. \"How many retreatments, we don\u2019t know yet, but the long-lasting effect is quite significant.\"",
      "Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and other administration officials have expressed interest in psychedelic therapy, suggesting it could receive fast-track review for veterans and others suffering psychological wounds.",
      "Generalized anxiety disorder is among the most common mental disorders, affecting nearly 3% of U.S. adults, according to the National Institutes of Health. Current treatments include psychotherapy, antidepressants and anti-anxiety drugs like benzodiazepines.",
      "The possibility of using LSD as a medical treatment isn\u2019t new.",
      "In the 1950s and 1960s more than 1,000 papers were published documenting LSD's use treating alcohol addiction, depression and other conditions. But a federal backlash was in full swing by the late 1960s, when psychedelics became linked to counterculture figures like Timothy Leary, the ex-Harvard professor who famously promoted the drugs as a means to \u201cturn on, tune in and dropout.\u201d",
      "A 1970 law classifying LSD and other psychedelics as Schedule 1 drugs \u2014 without any medical use and high potential for abuse \u2014 essentially halted U.S. research.",
      "When a handful of nonprofits begin reassessing the drugs in the 1980s and 1990s, they focused on lesser-known hallucinogens like MDMA and psilocybin, the main ingredient in magic mushrooms, to avoid the historic controversies surrounding LSD.",
      "\u201cLSD was right there in front of everybody, but Mindmed is the first company that actually decided to evaluate it,\u201d Fava said.",

      "STRAFFAN, Ireland -- Rory McIlroy hit a bogey-free 6-under 66 to move into contention after the second round of the Irish Open, where Joakim Lagergren of Sweden leads after a 62 on Friday.",
      "McIlroy jumped into a share of third place after making six birdies at The K Club, two of them coming at the last two holes to thrill the deep galleries following their Northern Irishman on his homecoming.",
      "\u201cAmazing \u2014 the whole day,\u201d McIlroy said. \u201cEven just walking to the range for the warmup today, the support is absolutely incredible. I\u2019m looking forward to playing in that atmosphere for the next couple of days as well.\u201d",
      "The world No. 2 will have to reel in Lagergren, who led on 12-under par after 36 holes, and Adrien Saddier of France, who added a 66 to an opening 67 and was one stroke back.",
      "The 33-year-old Lagergren has history at The K Club. Last year, when playing the Irish Challenge here on the adjoining Palmer South Course, he shot a course-record 63 and then holed out from a bunker to make eagle on the 72nd hole and earn a one-stroke victory.",

      "TORONTO -- TORONTO (AP) \u2014 Sydney Sweeney came to the Toronto International Film Festival wanting to talk about her new film \u201cChristy,\u201d not her American Eagle ad campaign. After a rapturous response to the movie, she\u2019s getting her wish.",
      "The 27-year-old, Emmy-nominated actor landed immediate Oscar buzz for her performance in David Mich\u00f4d\u2019s biopic of the boxer Christy Salters Martin. For the role, Sweeney transforms into the female boxing trailblazer who emerged out of West Virginia as the \u201cCoal Miner\u2019s Daughter\u201d to rise to the top of her then-nascent sport.",
      "Following a rousing reception from the TIFF audience Friday, Sweeney stood beside Martin on the stage of the Princess of Wales Theatre, calling it the experience of her life.",
      "\u201cIt was a dream come true, as an actor, as a person,\u201d Sweeney said.",
      "While Martin had a career decorated with belts and a Sports Illustrated cover, her story is defined by struggle. She was raised to deny her gay identity and instead married her trainer, Jim Martin. After years of psychological and physical abuse, he attempted to kill her in 2010, repeatedly stabbing her and shooting her. Jim Martin was sentenced to 25 years in prison. He died last November.",
      "Sweeney\u2019s performance alongside Ben Foster, who plays Jim Martin, was swiftly hailed as her best yet. TIFF has long been a launching pad for Oscar campaigns before, and the thunderous reception for \u201cChristy,\u201d and particularly Sweeney, seemed sure to add her to the awards conversation.",
      "Regardless, \u201cChristy\u201d gives Sweeney the best big-screen showcase yet of her rapidly evolving career. And given that she appears throughout it in short dark hair with a more muscular build, it's also her grittiest and least glamorous performance to date.",
      "Martin, praising Sweeney, explained how her boxing persona \u2014 bombastic, egotistical \u2014 didn\u2019t reflect her shyness or her desire to help others. Since her near-death experience, Martin has worked to help domestic violence survivors",

She wasn\u2019t the beautiful, sexy Sydney. She was the tough, rugged Christy.\u201d",
      "Going into the premiere, Sweeney deflected questions about her recent American Eagle ad campaign with the tagline \u201cSydney Sweeney has great jeans\u201d \u2014 a pun on having \u201cgreat genes.\u201d Critics accused the ad for glorifying whiteness.

The only team with a realistic shot is the Milwaukee Brewers, who rank 23rd in the league with a $112 million payroll. They'll have to go 14-7 over their final 21 games to hit 100.",

      "Novak Djokovic says he wants to keep striving to claim a record 25th Grand Slam singles title, but it's hard to compete with someone as talented and young as Carlos Alcaraz in best-of-five-set matches",
      "NEW YORK -- There was a moment, albeit a brief one, during his loss in the U.S. Open semifinals Friday that Novak Djokovic appeared to be making a match of it against Carlos Alcaraz.",
      "It was early in the second set, not quite an hour into the proceedings at Arthur Ashe Stadium, and Djokovic produced the sort of level that has carried him to 24 Grand Slam titles, more weeks at No. 1 in the rankings than anyone and all manner of other prizes.",
      "He cracked a return of a 132 mph serve, won the point and earned his first break chance. Then he cashed that in by coming out on top in a nine-stroke exchange, just the second service game Alcaraz lost over these two weeks. Suddenly, Djokovic was up 2-0 in that set. He threw an uppercut and held the pose. Spectators jumped out of their seats, screaming and clapping and singing his nickname, \u201cNo-le! No-le!\u201d",
      "In that moment, the 38-year-old Djokovic didn't look his age, didn't necessarily seem destined to come up short. A few minutes later, he led 3-0. Ah, but it wouldn't last.",
      "Alcaraz regained control and finished off his 6-4, 7-6 (4), 6-2 victory over a weary Djokovic in less than 2 1/2 hours. It was the fourth major semifinal for Djokovic this season \u2014 and fourth time his tournament ended at that stage.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not giving up on Grand Slams. ... I\u2019m going to continue fighting and trying to get to the finals and fight for another trophy, at least,\u201d said Djokovic, who would love to become the first player in tennis history with 25 major singles trophies. \u201cBut, you know, it\u2019s going to be a very difficult task.\u201d",
      "Three of those 2025 semifinal departures came against No. 1 Jannik Sinner, who is 24, or No. 2 Alcaraz, who is 22; one exit came when Djokovic quit after one set against Alexander Zverev at the Australian Open in January because of an injured hamstring.",

      "McCaffrey transformed San Francisco\u2019s offense after being acquired midway through the 2022 season in a trade from Carolina. He helped the team reach the NFC title game that season and then did even more in 2023 in his first full season with the Niners.",
      "McCaffrey won the AP Offensive Player of the Year that season after leading the NFL with 2,023 yards from scrimmage and tying for the league lead with 21 touchdowns.",
      "McCaffrey had missed just one game combined in 2022-23 \u2014 a meaningless Week 18 game in the 2023 season for San Francisco when he had a sore calf \u2014 after missing 23 games because of injuries in his final two full seasons with Carolina.",
      "If McCaffrey can't go, the Niners will likely turn to recently acquired Brian Robinson, who joined the team last week following a trade from Washington. Robinson has been rushing to learn the offense and would likely share the rushing with Isaac Guerendo.",

      "Scientists conducting a first-of-its-kind drilling operation have extracted samples of fresh water hiding in massive reservoirs deep under the ocean",
      "ABOARD LIFTBOAT ROBERT, North Atlantic -- Deep in Earth's past, an icy landscape became a seascape as the ice melted and the oceans rose off what is now the northeastern United States. Nearly 50 years ago, a U.S. government ship searching for minerals and hydrocarbons in the area drilled into the seafloor to see what it could find.",
      "It found, of all things, drops to drink under the briny deeps \u2014 fresh water.",
      "This summer, a first-of-its-kind global research expedition followed up on that surprise. Drilling for fresh water under the salt water off Cape Cod, Expedition 501 extracted thousands of samples from what is now thought to be a massive, hidden aquifer stretching from New Jersey as far north as Maine.",
      "It's just one of many depositories of \u201csecret fresh water\u201d known to exist in shallow salt waters around the world that might some day be tapped to slake the planet\u2019s intensifying thirst, said Brandon Dugan, the expedition's co-chief scientist.",
      "\u201cWe need to look for every possibility we have to find more water for society,\u201d Dugan, a geophysicist and hydrologist at the Colorado School of Mines, told Associated Press journalists who recently spent 12 hours on the drilling platform. The research teams looked in \u201cone of the last places you would probably look for fresh water on Earth.\u201d",
      "They found it, and will be analyzing nearly 50,000 liters (13,209 gallons) of it back in their labs around the world in the coming months. They're out to solve the mystery of its origins \u2014 whether the water is from glaciers, connected groundwater systems on land or some combination.",
      "The potential is enormous. So are the hurdles of getting the water out and puzzling over who owns it, who uses it and how to extract it without undue harm to nature. It's bound to take years to bring that water ashore for public use in a big way, if it's even feasible.",
      "Why try? In just five years, the U.N. says, the global demand for fresh water will exceed supplies by 40%. Rising sea levels from the warming climate are souring coastal freshwater sources while data centers that power AI and cloud computing are consuming water at an insatiable rate.",
      "The fabled Ancient Mariner\u2019s lament, \u201cWater, water, every where, nor any drop to drink,\u201d looms as a warning to landlubbers as well as to sailors on salty seas.",
      "In Virginia alone, a quarter of all power produced in the state goes to data centers, a share expected to nearly double in five years. By some estimates, each midsize data center consumes as much water as 1,000 households. Each of the Great Lakes states has experienced groundwater shortages.",
      "Cape Town, South Africa, came perilously close to running out of fresh water for its nearly 5 million people in 2018 during an epic, three-year drought. South Africa is thought to have a coastal undersea freshwater bonanza, too, and there is at least anecdotal evidence that every continent may have the same.",
      "Canada's Prince Edward Island, Hawaii and Jakarta, Indonesia, are among places where stressed freshwater supplies coexist with prospective aquifers under the ocean.",
      "Enter Expedition 501, a $25 million scientific collaboration of more than a dozen countries backed by the U.S. government's National Science Foundation and the European Consortium for Ocean Research Drilling (U.S. money for it was secured before budget cuts sought by the Trump administration).",
      "Scientists went into the project believing the undersea aquifer they were sampling might be sufficient to meet the needs of a metropolis the size of New York City for 800 years. They found fresh or nearly fresh water at both higher and lower depths below the seafloor than they anticipated, suggesting a larger supply even than that.",
      "Their work at sea unfolded over three months from Liftboat Robert, an oceangoing vessel that, once on site, lowers three enormous pillars to the seafloor and squats above the waves. Normally it services offshore petroleum sites and wind farms. This drill-baby-drill mission was different.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s known that this phenomena exists both here and elsewhere around the world,\u201d Expedition 501 project manager Jez Everest, a scientist who came from the British Geological Survey in Edinburgh, Scotland, said of undersea water. \u201cBut it\u2019s a subject that\u2019s never been directly investigated by any research project in the past.\u201d",
      "By that, he means no one globally had drilled systematically into the seabed on a mission to find freshwater. Expedition 501 was quite literally groundbreaking \u2014 it penetrated Earth below the sea by as many as 1,289 feet or nearly 400 meters.",
      "But it followed a 2015 research project that mapped contours of an aquifer remotely, using electromagnetic technology, and roughly estimated salinity of the water underneath.",
      "That mission, by the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution and Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory at Columbia University, reported evidence of a \u201cmassive offshore aquifer system\u201d in this area, possibly rivalling the size of America\u2019s largest \u2014 the Ogallala aquifer, which supplies water to parts of eight Great Plains states.",
      "Two developments in 1976 had stirred interest in searching for undersea freshwater.",
      "In the middle of Nantucket island, the U.S. Geological Survey drilled a test well to see how far down the groundwater went. It extracted fresh water from such great depths that it made scientists wonder if the water came from the sea, not the sky.",
      "The same year, that federal agency mounted a 60-day expedition aboard the drilling vessel Glomar Conception along a vast stretch of the Continental Shelf from Georgia to Georges Bank off New England. It drilled cores in search of the sub-seabed's resources, like methane.",
      "It found an eye-opening amount of fresh or freshened water in borehole after borehole.",

      "Soon after Robert arrived at the first of three drilling sites May 19, samples drawn from below the seabed registered salinity of just 4 parts per thousand. That's far below the oceans' average salt content of 35 parts per thousand but still too briny to meet the U.S. freshwater standard of under 1 part per thousand.",
      "\u201cFour parts per thousand was a eureka moment,\" Dugan said, because the finding suggested that the water must have been connected to a terrestrial system in the past, or still is.",
      "As the weeks wore on and Robert moved from site to site 20 to 30 miles (30 to 50 kilometers) off the coast, the process of drilling into the waterlogged subsea sediment yielded a collection of samples down to 1 part per thousand salt content. Some were even lower.",
      "Bingo. That's what you find in many bodies of fresh water on land. That's water you can drink, in theory. No one did.",
      "In months of analysis ahead, the scientists will investigate a range of properties of the water, including what microbes were living in the depths, what they used for nutrients and energy sources and what byproducts they might generate; in other words, whether the water is safe to consume or otherwise use.",
      "\u201cThis is a new environment that has never been studied before,\u201d said Jocelyne DiRuggiero, a Johns Hopkins University biologist in Baltimore who studies the microbial ecology of extreme environments and is not involved in the expedition.",
      "\u201cThe water may contain minerals detrimental to human health since it percolated through layers of sediments,\u201d she said. \u201cHowever, a similar process forms the terrestrial aquifers that we use for freshwater, and those typically have very high quality.\u201d",
      "By sequencing DNA extracted from their samples, she said, the researchers can determine which microorganisms are there and \u201clearn how they potentially make a living.\u201d",
      "Techniques will also be used to determine whether it came from glacial ice melt thousands of years ago or is still coming via labyrinthian geologic formations from land.",
      "Researchers will date the water back in the lab, and that will be key in determining whether it is a renewable resource that could be used responsibly. Primordial water is trapped and finite; newer water suggests the aquifer is still connected to a terrestrial source and being refreshed, however slowly.",
      "\u201cYounger means it was a raindrop 100 years ago, 200 years ago,\u201d Dugan said. \u201cIf young, it\u2019s recharging.\u201d",
      "Those questions are for basic science. For society, all sorts of complex questions arise if the basic science affirms the conditions necessary for exploiting the water. Who will manage it? Can it be taken without an unacceptable risk of contaminating the supply from the ocean above? Will it be cheaper or environmentally friendlier than today's energy-hungry desalination plants?",
      "Dugan said if governments decide to get the water, local communities could turn to the aquifers in time of need, such as drought, or when extreme storms flood coastal freshwater reserves and ruin them. The notion of actually using this old buried water is so new that it has not been on the radar of many policymakers or conservationists.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a lesson in how long it can take sometimes to make these things happen and the perseverance that\u2019s needed to get there,\" said Woods Hole geophysicist Rob Evans, whose 2015 expedition helped point the way for 501. \u201cThere\u2019s a ton of excitement that finally they\u2019ve got samples.\"",
      "Still, he sees some red flags. One is that tapping undersea aquifers could draw water away from onshore reserves. Another is that undersea groundwater that seeps out to the seafloor may supply nutrients vital to the ecosystem, and that could be upset.",
      "\"If we were to go out and start pumping these waters, there would almost certainly be unforeseen consequences,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of balance we would need to consider before we started diving in and drilling and exploiting these kinds of things.\u201d",
      "For most in the project, getting to and from Liftboat Robert meant a voyage of seven hours or more from Fall River, Massachusetts, on a supply boat that made round trips every 10 days or so to replenish stocks and rotate people.",
      "On the platform, around the clock, the racket of metal bore pipes and machinery, the drilling grime and the speckled mud mingled with the quieter, cleaner work of scientists in trailers converted to pristine labs and processing posts.",
      "There, samples were treated according to the varying needs of the expedition\u2019s geologists, geochemists, hydrologists, microbiologists, sedimentologists and more.",
      "Passing through clear plastic tubes, muck was sliced into disks like hockey pucks. Machines squeezed water out. Some samples were kept sealed to enable study of ancient gases dissolved in the water. Other samples were frozen, filtered or left as is, depending on the purpose.",
      "After six months of lab analysis, all the science teams of Expedition 501 will meet again \u2014 this time in Germany for a month of collaborative research that is expected to produce initial findings that point to the age and origin of the water.",

      "The Pentagon didn't immediately respond to an Associated Press request for comment. Beijing has in the past said science and technological cooperation between the two countries is mutually beneficial and helps the two sides cope with global challenges.",
      "The congressional report said some officials at the Defense Department argued research should remain open as long as it is \u201cneither controlled nor classified.\u201d",
      "The report makes several recommendations to scale back U.S. research collaboration with China. It also backs new legislation proposed by the committee's chairman, Rep. John Moolenaar, R-Michigan. The bill would prohibit any Defense Department funding from going to projects done in collaboration with researchers affiliated with Chinese entities that the U.S. government identifies as safety risks.",
      "The 80-page report builds on the committee's findings last year that partnerships between U.S. and Chinese universities over the past decade allowed hundreds of millions of dollars in federal funding to help Beijing develop critical technology. Amid pressure from Republicans, several U.S. universities have ended their joint programs with Chinese schools in recent years.",
      "The new report focuses more narrowly on the Defense Department and its billions of dollars in annual research funding.",
      "The committee's investigation identified 1,400 research papers published between June 2023 and June 2025 that acknowledged support from the Pentagon and were done in collaboration with Chinese partners. The publications were funded by some 700 defense grants worth more than $2.5 billion. Of the 1,400 publications, more than half involved organizations affiliated with China's defense research and industrial base.",
      "Dozens of those organizations were flagged for potential security concerns on U.S. government lists, though federal law does not prohibit research collaborations with them. The Defense Department money supported research in fields including hypersonic technology, semiconductors, artificial intelligence, advanced materials and next-generation propulsion.",

      "IRVING, Texas -- Crowded around a workshop table, four girls at de Zavala Middle School puzzled over a Lego machine they had built. As they flashed a purple card in front of a light sensor, nothing happened.",
      "The teacher at the Dallas-area school had emphasized that in the building process, there is no such thing as mistakes. Only iterations. So the girls dug back into the box of blocks and pulled out an orange card. They held it over the sensor and the machine kicked into motion.",
      "\u201cOh! Oh, it reacts differently to different colors,\u201d said sixth grader Sofia Cruz.",
      "In de Zavala\u2019s first year as a choice school focused on science, technology, engineering and math, the school recruited a sixth grade class that\u2019s half girls. School leaders are hoping the girls will stick with STEM fields. In de Zavala\u2019s higher grades \u2014 whose students joined before it was a STEM school \u2014 some elective STEM classes have just one girl enrolled.",
      "Efforts to close the gap between boys and girls in STEM classes are picking up after losing steam nationwide during the chaos of the COVID-19 pandemic. Schools have extensive work ahead to make up for the ground girls lost, in both interest and performance.",
      "In the years leading up to the pandemic, the gender gap nearly closed. But within a few years, girls lost all the ground they had gained in math test scores over the previous decade, according to an Associated Press analysis. While boys' scores also suffered during COVID, they have recovered faster than girls, widening the gender gap.",
      "As learning went online, special programs to engage girls lapsed \u2014 and schools were slow to restart them. Zoom school also emphasized rote learning, a technique based on repetition that some experts believe may favor boys, instead of teaching students to solve problems in different ways, which may benefit girls.",
      "Old practices and biases likely reemerged during the pandemic, said Michelle Stie, a vice president at the National Math and Science Initiative.",
      "\u201cLet\u2019s just call it what it is,\u201d Stie said. \u201cWhen society is disrupted, you fall back into bad patterns.\u201d",
      "In most school districts in the 2008-2009 school year, boys had higher average math scores on standardized tests than girls, according to AP's analysis, which looked at scores across 15 years in over 5,000 school districts. It was based on average test scores for third through eighth graders in 33 states, compiled by the Educational Opportunity Project at Stanford University.",
      "A decade later, girls had not only caught up, they were ahead: Slightly more than half of districts had higher math averages for girls.",
      "Within a few years of the pandemic, the parity disappeared. In 2023-2024, boys on average outscored girls in math in nearly nine out of 10 districts.",
      "A separate study by NWEA, an education research company, found gaps between boys and girls in science and math on national assessments went from being practically non-existent in 2019 to favoring boys around 2022.",
      "Studies have indicated girls reported higher levels of anxiety and depression during the pandemic, plus more caretaking burdens than boys, but the dip in academic performance did not appear outside STEM. Girls outperformed boys in reading in nearly every district nationwide before the pandemic and continued to do so afterward.",
      "\u201cIt wasn\u2019t something like COVID happened and girls just fell apart,\u201d said Megan Kuhfeld, one of the authors of the NWEA study.",
      "In the years leading up to the pandemic, teaching practices shifted to deemphasize speed, competition and rote memorization. Through new curriculum standards, schools moved toward research-backed methods that emphasized how to think flexibly to solve problems and how to tackle numeric problems conceptually.",
      "Educators also promoted participation in STEM subjects and programs that boosted girls\u2019 confidence, including extracurriculars that emphasized hands-on learning and connected abstract concepts to real-life applications.",
      "When STEM courses had large male enrollment, Superintendent Kenny Rodrequez noticed girls losing interest as boys dominated classroom discussions at his schools in Grandview C-4 District outside Kansas City. Girls were significantly more engaged after the district moved some of its introductory hands-on STEM curriculum to the lower grade levels and balanced classes by gender, he said.",

      "CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. -- Scientists revealed Wednesday that Mars\u2019 innermost core appears to be a solid hunk of metal just like Earth\u2019s.",
      "The Chinese-led research team based their findings on seismic readings from NASA\u2019s InSight lander on Mars, which recorded more than 1,300 marsquakes before shutting down in 2022. The spacecraft landed on a broad plain near Mars\u2019 equator in 2018.",
      "Previous studies pointed to liquid at the heart of the red planet. The latest findings indicate the inner core, while small, is indeed solid and surrounded by molten metal \u2014 a liquid outer core.",
      "The Martian inner core extends from the planet\u2019s center out to a radius of approximately 380 miles (613 kilometers), according to the scientists whose findings appeared in the journal Nature.",
      "It\u2019s likely composed of iron and nickel, the same ingredients as Earth\u2019s core, but quite possibly also enriched with lighter elements like oxygen.",
      "Mars\u2019 liquid outer core is bigger, stretching from 380 miles (613 kilometers) to as much as 1,100 miles (1,800 kilometers) from the planet\u2019s center.",
      "Crystallization of Mars\u2019 inner core may have occurred in the past and still be occurring today, one of the lead investigators, Daoyuan Sun of the University of Science and Technology of China, said in an email.",

      "For their study, Sun and his team relied primarily on 23 marsquakes recorded by InSight, all of them relatively weak. The epicenters were 740 miles to 1,465 miles (1,200 kilometers to 2,360 kilometers) away from the lander.",

      "While praising the results, the University of Maryland\u2019s Nicholas Schmerr, who was not involved in the study, said questions regarding Mars\u2019 core are far from settled.

      "\u201cThere are a lot of details about the exact shape of the inner core and composition of the inner and outer core of Mars that will require a network of InSight like seismometer stations to resolve,\u201d Schmerr said in an email.",
      "More detailed modeling is necessary to develop a clearer picture of how the inner core formed and \"what it reveals about the history of Mars' magnetic field,\u201d said Sun.",

      "That dire prospect prompted a New Zealand nature lover who found the snail in her garden in August to launch a campaign to find his perfect match. But Ned\u2019s quest for true love, perhaps predictably, is slow.",
      "Giselle Clarkson was weeding her home vegetable patch in Wairarapa on the North Island when a snail tumbling out of the leafy greens caught her eye. Clarkson, the author and illustrator of a nature book, \u201cThe Observologist,\u201d has an affection for snails and had long been on the lookout for a sinistral, or left-coiled shell.",
      "\u201cI knew immediately that I couldn\u2019t just toss the snail back into the weeds with the others,\u201d she said. Instead, she sent a photo of the snail, pictured alongside a right-coiled gastropod as proof, to her colleagues at New Zealand Geographic.",
      "The magazine launched a nationwide campaign to find a mate for Ned, named for the left-handed character Ned Flanders in \u201cThe Simpsons,\u201d who once opened a store called The Leftorium. That explains the male pronouns some use for Ned, although snails are hermaphrodites with sex organs on their necks and the capacity for both eggs and sperm.",
      "\u201cWhen you have a right-coiling snail and a left-coiling snail, they can\u2019t slide up and get their pieces meeting in the right position,\u201d Clarkson said. \u201cSo a lefty can only mate with another lefty.\u201d",
      "The fact that romantic hopefuls need not be a sex match should have boosted Ned\u2019s prospects. But his inbox has remained empty except for photos of \u201coptimistically misidentified right-coiling snails,\" Clarkson said.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve had lots of enthusiasm and encouragement for Ned, a lot of people who can relate and really want the best for them, as a symbol of hope for everyone who\u2019s looking for love,\u201d she said. \u201cBut as yet, no lefties have been forthcoming.\u201d",
      "Ned\u2019s relatable romantic woes have attracted global news coverage, but New Zealand\u2019s strict biosecurity controls mean long-distance love probably isn\u2019t on the cards. Other left-coiled snails have gotten lucky through public campaigns to find mates before, however, so Clarkson remains optimistic.",

      "SAN FRANCISCO -- A federal judge on Tuesday ordered a shake-up of Google\u2019s search engine in an attempt to curb the corrosive power of an illegal monopoly while rebuffing the U.S. government's attempt to break up the company and impose other restraints.",
      "The 226-page decision made by U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta in Washington, D.C., will likely ripple across the technological landscape at a time when the industry is being reshaped by breakthroughs in artificial intelligence \u2014 including conversational \u201canswer engines\u201d as companies like ChatGPT and Perplexity try to upend Google\u2019s long-held position as the internet\u2019s main gateway.",
      "The innovations and competition being unleashed by AI also reshaped the judge\u2019s approach to the remedies in the nearly five-year-old antitrust case brought by the U.S. Justice Department during President Donald Trump\u2019s first administration and carried onward by President Joe Biden's administration.",
      "\u201cUnlike the typical case where the court\u2019s job is to resolve a dispute based on historic facts, here the court is asked to gaze into a crystal ball and look to the future. Not exactly a judge\u2019s forte,\u201d Mehta wrote.",
      "The judge is trying to rein in Google by prohibiting some of the tactics the company deployed to drive traffic to its search engine and other services. The ruling also will pry open some of the prized databases of closely guarded information about search that have provided Google with a seemingly insurmountable advantage.",
      "The handcuffs being slapped on Google will preclude contracts that give its search engine, Gemini AI app, Play Store for Android and virtual assistant an exclusive position on smartphone, personal computers and other devices.",
      "But Mehta stopped short of banning the multi-billion dollar deals that Google has been making for years to lock in its search engine as the default on smartphones, personal computers and other devices. Those deals, involving payments of more than $26 billion annually, were one of the main issues that prompted the judge to conclude Google\u2019s search engine was an illegal monopoly, but he decided banning them in the future would do more harm than good.",
      "The judge also rejected the U.S. Justice Department\u2019s effort to force Google to sell its popular Chrome browser, concluding it was an unwarranted step that \u201cwould be incredibly messy and highly risky.\u201d",
      "Partially because he is allowing the default deals to continue, Mehta is ordering Google to give its current and would-be rivals access to some of its search engine\u2019s secret sauce \u2014 the data stockpiled from trillions of queries that it used to help improve the quality of its search results. That is a measure that Google had also fiercely opposed, contending it was unfair and would raise privacy and security risk for the billions of people who have posed questions to its search engine \u2014 sometimes delving into sensitive issues.",
      "The Justice Department's antitrust chief, Gail Slater, hailed the decision as a \u201cmajor win for the American people,\u201d even though the agency didn't get everything it sought. \u201cWe are now weighing our options and thinking through whether the ordered relief goes far enough,\u201d Slater wrote in a post.",
      "In its own post, Google framed Mehta's ruling as a vindication of its long-held position that the case never should have been brought. The decision \u201crecognizes how much the industry has changed through the advent of AI, which is giving people so many more ways to find information,\u201d wrote Lee-Anne Mulholland, Google's vice president of regulatory affairs. \u201cThis underlines what we\u2019ve been saying since this case was filed in 2020: Competition is intense and people can easily choose the services they want.\u201d",
      "The Mountain View, California, company has already vowed to appeal the judge\u2019s monopoly findings issued 13 months ago that led to Tuesday's ruling.",

      "Investors seemed to interpret the ruling as a relatively light slap on the wrist for Google, as the stock price of its corporate parent, Alphabet Inc., surged more than 7% in extended trading. That would translate into a nearly $200 billion increase in Alphabet's market value, if the shares follow a similar trajectory in Wednesday's regular trading session.",
      "Allowing the default search deals to continue is more than just a victory for Google. It\u2019s also a win for Apple, which receives more than $20 billion annually from Google, and other recipients of the payments.",
      "In hearings earlier this year, Apple warned the judge that banning the contracts would deprive the company of money that it funnels into its own innovative research. The Cupertino, California, company also cautioned that the ban could have the unintended consequence of making Google even more powerful by pocketing the money it had been spending on deals while most consumers will still end up flocking to Google\u2019s search engine anyway.",
      "Others, such as the owners of the Firefox search engine, asserted that losing the Google contracts would threaten their future survival by depriving them of essential revenue.",
      "Apple's shares rose 3% in extended trading after the ruling came out.",
      "Mehta refrained from ordering a sale of Chrome because he decided there wasn't adequate proof the browser served as an essential ingredient in Google's search monopoly, making a divestiture \u201ca poor fit for this case.\u201d",
      "Chrome would have been a hot commodity had the judge forced Google to put it on the auction block. Perplexity submitted an unsolicited $34.5 billion offer to buy Chrome last month. And during court testimony earlier this year, a ChatGPT executive left no doubt that service\u2019s owner, OpenAI, would be interested in be interested in buying Chrome, too.",
      "But the judge decided forcing Google to open up parts of its search data to rivals such as DuckDuckGo, Bing, and others will offer he best and fairest way to foster more compelling competition. In doing so, Mehta still narrowed the scope of the Justice Department's request and will limit the access to Google's search index and query histories.",
      "While the wrangling over Mehta's ruling continues, Google is facing another potentially debilitating threat in another antitrust case brought by the Justice Department targeting the digital ad empire that was built up around its search engine. After different federal judge in Virginia declared that some of the technology underlying the ad network to be an illegal monopoly earlier this year, the Justice Department plans to make its case for another proposed breakup  in a trial scheduled to begin later this month.",

      "Oliver McCann, a British AI music creator, uses AI to produce songs across various genres",
      "LONDON -- When pop groups and rock bands practice or perform, they rely on their guitars, keyboards and drumsticks to make music. Oliver McCann, a British AI music creator who goes by the stage name imoliver, fires up his chatbot.",
      "McCann's songs span a range of genres, from indie-pop to electro-soul to country-rap. There\u2019s just one crucial difference between McCann and traditional musicians.",
      "\u201cI have no musical talent at all,\u201d he said. \u201cI can\u2019t sing, I can\u2019t play instruments, and I have no musical background at all.\"",
      "McCann, 37, who has a background as a visual designer, started experimenting with AI to see if it could boost his creativity and \"bring some of my lyrics to life.\u201d Last month, he signed with independent record label Hallwood Media after one of his tracks racked up 3 million streams, in what's billed as the first time a music label has inked a contract with an AI music creator.",
      "McCann is an example of how ChatGPT-style AI song generation tools like Suno and Udio have spawned a wave of synthetic music. A movement most notably highlighted by a fictitious group, Velvet Sundown, that went viral even though all its songs, lyrics and album art were created by AI.",
      "It fueled debate about AI's role in music while raising fears about \"AI slop\" \u2014 automatically generated low quality mass produced content. It also cast a spotlight on AI song generators that are democratizing song making but threaten to disrupt the music industry.",
      "Experts say generative AI is set to transform the music world. However, there are scant details, so far, on how it's impacting the $29.6 billion global recorded music market, which includes about $20 billion from streaming.",
      "The most reliable figures come from music streaming service Deezer, which estimates that 18% of songs uploaded to its platform every day are purely AI generated, though they only account for a tiny amount of total streams, hinting that few people are actually listening. Other, bigger streaming platforms like Spotify haven't released any figures on AI music.",
      "Udio declined to comment on how many users it has and how many songs it has generated. Suno did not respond to a request for comment. Both have free basic levels as well as pro and premium tiers that come with access to more advanced AI models.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a total boom. It\u2019s a tsunami,\u201d said Josh Antonuccio, director of Ohio University's School of Media Arts and Studies. The amount of AI generated music \u201cis just going to only exponentially increase\u201d as young people grow up with AI and become more comfortable with it, he said.",
      "Yet generative AI, with its ability to spit out seemingly unique content, has divided the music world, with musicians and industry groups complaining that recorded works are being exploited to train AI models that power song generation tools.",
      "Record labels are trying to fend off the threat that AI music startups pose to their revenue streams even as they hope to tap into it for new earnings, while recording artists worry that it will devalue their creativity.",
      "Three major record companies, Sony Music Entertainment, Universal Music Group and Warner Records, filed lawsuits last year against Suno and Udio for copyright infringement. In June, the two sides also reportedly entered negotiations that could go beyond settling the lawsuits and set rules for how artists are paid when AI is used to remix their songs.",
      "GEMA, a German royalty collection society, has sued Suno, accusing it of generating music similar to songs like \u201cMambo No. 5\u201d by Lou Bega and \u201cForever Young\u201d by Alphaville.",
      "More than 1,000 musicians, including Kate Bush, Annie Lennox and Damon Albarn, released a silent album to protest proposed changes to U.K. laws on AI they fear would erode their creative control. Meanwhile, other artists, such as will.i.am, Timbaland and Imogen Heap, have embraced the technology.",

I see it as any other tool that we have,\u201d said Scott Smith, whose AI band, Pulse Empire, was inspired by 1980s British synthesizer-driven groups like New Order and Depeche Mode.",
      "Smith, 56 and a semi-retired former U.S. Navy public affairs officer in Portland, Oregon, said \u201cmusic producers have lots of tools in their arsenal\u201d to enhance recordings that listeners aren't aware of.",
      "Like McCann, Smith never mastered a musical instrument. Both say they put lots of time and effort into crafting their music.",
      "Once Smith gets inspiration, it takes him just 10 minutes to write the lyrics. But then he'll spend as much as eight to nine hours generating different versions until the song \u201cmatches my vision.\u201d",

      "\u201cAI lyrics tend to come out quite cliche and quite boring,\u201d McCann said.",
      "Lukas Rams, a Philadelphia-area resident who makes songs for his AI band Sleeping With Wolves, said AI lyrics tend to be \u201cextra corny\u201d and not as creative as a human, but can help get the writing process started.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019ll do very basic rhyme schemes, and it\u2019ll keep repeating the same structure,\u201d said Rams, who writes his own words, sometimes while putting his kids to bed and waiting for them to fall asleep. \u201cAnd then you\u2019ll get words in there that are very telling of AI-generated lyrics, like \u2018neon,\u2019 anything with \u2018shadows\u2019.\u201d",
      "Rams used to play drums in high school bands and collaborated with his brother on their own songs, but work and family life started taking up more of his time.",
      "Then he discovered AI, which he used to create three albums for Sleeping With Wolves. He's been taking it seriously, making a CD jewel case with album art. He plans to post his songs, which combine metalcore and EDM, more widely online.",
      "\u201cI do want to start putting this up on YouTube or socials or distribution or whatever, just to have it out there,\u201d Rams said. \u201cI might as well, otherwise I\u2019m literally the only person that hears this stuff.\u201d",
      "Experts say AI's potential to let anyone come up with a hit song is poised to shake up the music industry's production pipeline.",
      "\"Just think about what it used to cost to make a hit or make something that breaks,\" Antonuccio said. \"And that just keeps winnowing down from a major studio to a laptop to a bedroom. And now it\u2019s like a text prompt \u2014 several text prompts.\u201d",
      "But he added that AI music is still in a \u201cWild West\u201d phase because of the lack of legal clarity over copyright. He compared it to the legal battles more than two decades ago over file-sharing sites like Napster that heralded the transition from CDs to digital media and eventually paved the way for today's music streaming services.",
      "Creators hope AI, too, will eventually become a part of the mainstream music world.",
      "\u201cI think we\u2019re entering a world where anyone, anywhere could make the next big hit,\u201d said McCann. \u201cAs AI becomes more widely accepted among people as a musical art form, I think it opens up the possibility for AI music to be featured in charts.\u201d",

      "The 6.0 magnitude quake late Sunday hit towns in the province of Kunar, near the city of Jalalabad in neighboring Nangarhar province, causing extensive damage.",
      "The quake at 11:47 p.m. was centered 27 kilometers (17 miles) east-northeast of Jalalabad, the U.S. Geological Survey said. It was just 8 kilometers (5 miles) deep. Shallower quakes tend to cause more damage. Several aftershocks followed.",
      "Footage showed rescuers taking injured people on stretchers from collapsed buildings and into helicopters as people frantically dug through rubble with their hands.",

      "Eastern Afghanistan is mountainous, with remote areas.",
      "The quake has worsened communications. Blocked roads are forcing aid workers to walk four or five hours to reach survivors. Dozens of flights have operated in and out of Nangarhar Airport, transporting the injured to hospitals.",
      "One survivor described seeing homes collapse before his eyes and people screaming for help.",
      "Sadiqullah, who lives in the Maza Dara area of Nurgal, said he was woken by a deep boom that sounded like a storm approaching. Like many Afghans, he uses only one name.",
      "He ran to where his children were sleeping and rescued three of them. He was about to return to grab the rest of his family when the room fell on top of him.",
      "\u201cI was half-buried and unable to get out,\u201d he told The Associated Press by phone from Nangarhar Hospital. \u201cMy wife and two sons are dead, and my father is injured and in hospital with me. We were trapped for three to four hours until people from other areas arrived and pulled me out.\"",
      "It felt like the whole mountain was shaking, he said.",

    "story": [
      "Bulgarian authorities aren't investigating a suspected Russian interference operation involving a plane carrying European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen because they say the interference is now common",
      "LONDON -- Bulgaria will not investigate suspected Russian electronic interference with a top European official's plane, officials said Monday \u2014 because this kind of GPS jamming is now so common.",
      "European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen was flying to Plovdiv, Bulgaria on Sunday when her plane was hit by GPS jamming. It landed safely but the disruption was the latest in a string of almost 80 incidents tracked by The Associated Press and blamed on Russia by Western officials since Moscow invaded Ukraine in 2022.",
      "This year, Nordic and Baltic nations \u2014 including Finland, Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia \u2014 have repeatedly warned about greater electronic interference from Russia disrupting communications with planes, ships and drones.",
      "While Russian authorities suggest the jamming is defensive \u2014 to protect key cities and military infrastructure from Ukrainian drone attacks \u2014 Baltic officials say the depth of electronic interference has increased, causing navigation failures far from Russia's borders.",
      "In 2024, a plane carrying the British defense secretary had its satellite signal jammed as it flew near Russian territory, while a Finnish airline temporarily suspended flights to the Estonian city of Tartu.",
      "NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte said the interference experienced by von der Leyen's plane was part of a complex campaign by Russia against Europe which could have \u201cpotentially disastrous effects.\u201d",
      "Satellite communications systems \u2014 known collectively as the Global Navigation Satellite System or GNSS \u2014 receive precise time signals from satellites around 20,000 kilometers (12,400 miles) away in space. A smartphone, car, marine or aircraft navigation system compares how long it takes to receive signals from several different satellites to calculate an exact location.",
      "But the signals can be interfered with \u2014 commonly known as jamming or spoofing.",
      "Jamming means a receiver is overwhelmed by a strong radio signal transmitted in the same range where GNSS and other satellite navigation signals operate, leaving the receiver unable to fix a location or time. Spoofing involves transmitting fake signals which imitate a real GNSS satellite signal \u2014 commonly known as GPS \u2014 to mislead a phone, ship or aircraft into thinking it is in a different place.",
      "In a military context, jamming could be used to stop an incoming missile or drone attack, whereas the idea behind spoofing is to \u201ccreate deception,\u201d said Thomas Withington, an expert in electronic warfare at the Royal United Services Institute in London.",
      "It's possible that Israel used spoofing technology to fly into Iranian airspace in June, when it killed top generals and struck nuclear sites, Withington suggested. Spoofing, he said, could have helped Israel deceive Iranian radar.",
      "Long before the invasion of Ukraine, Russian authorities deployed spoofing technology around the Kremlin in Moscow, causing chaos for taxi drivers or other motorists using GPS.",
      "Russia \u201cdoes not mind\u201d if its own infrastructure is affected, as long as enemy activity is deterred, said Withington.",
      "In August, Latvia\u2019s Electronic Communications Office said it had identified at least three hot spots for electronic interference along borders with Russia in the Kaliningrad, Leningrad and Pskov regions. All three regions host important Russian military bases.",
      "In April 2024, Finland's national carrier Finnair temporarily suspended flights to Tartu, Estonia after it said two of its planes were prevented from landing because of GPS disruptions. At that time, Tartu airport required approaching planes to use GPS to land, although planes have \u2014 and use \u2014 other forms of navigation.",
      "These include radio navigation and Inertial Navigation Systems, which determine where an aircraft \u2014 or submarine \u2014 is located by measuring its position in the air or water without relying on GPS.",

      "Gray wolves were hunted nearly to extinction throughout the U.S. West by the first half of the 20th century. Since their reintroduction in Idaho and at Yellowstone National Park in the mid-1990s, they've proliferated to the point that a population in the Northern Rockies has been removed from the endangered species list.",
      "There are now hundreds of wolves in Washington and Oregon, dozens more in northern California, and thousands roaming near the Great Lakes.",
      "The recovering population has meant increasing conflict with ranchers \u2014 and increasingly creative efforts by the latter to protect livestock. They've turned to electrified fencing, wolf alarms, guard dogs, horseback patrols, trapping and relocating, and now drones. In some areas where nonlethal efforts have failed, officials routinely approve killing wolves, including last week in Washington state.",
      "Gray wolves killed some 800 domesticated animals across 10 states in 2022, a previous Associated Press review of data from state and federal agencies found.",
      "Scientists with the USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service developed the techniques for hazing wolves by drone while monitoring them using thermal imaging cameras at night, when the predators are most active. A preliminary study released in 2022 demonstrated that adding human voices through a loudspeaker rigged onto a drone can freak them out.",
      "The team documented successful interruptions of wolf hunts. When Dustin Ranglack, the USDA\u2019s lead researcher on the project, saw one for the first time, he smiled from ear to ear.",

      "It\u2019s unclear whether the wolves might become accustomed to the drones. Herders and wolf hunters in Europe have long deterred them with long lines hung with flapping cloth, but the wolves can eventually learn that the flags are not a threat.",
      "Environmental advocates are optimistic about drones, though, because they allow for scaring wolves in different ways, in different places.",
      "\u201cWolves are frightened of novel things,\u201d said Amaroq Weiss, a wolf advocate with the Center for Biological Diversity. \u201cI know that in the human imagination, people think of wolves as big, scary critters that are scared of nothing.\u201d",
      "There are also drawbacks to the technology. A drone with night vision and a loudspeaker costs around $20,000, requires professional training and doesn't work well in wooded areas, making it impractical for many ranchers.",
      "Ranchers in Northern California who have hosted USDA drone patrols agree that they have reduced livestock deaths so far.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m very appreciative of what they did. But I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a long-term solution,\u201d said Mary Rickert, the owner of a cattle ranch north of Mount Shasta. \u201cWhat I\u2019m afraid of is that after some period of time, that all of a sudden they go, \u2018Wow, this isn\u2019t going to hurt me. It just makes a lot of noise.\u2019\u201d",
      "Ranchers are compensated if they can prove that a wolf killed their livestock. But there are uncompensated costs of having stressed-out cows, such as lower birth rates and tougher meat.",
      "Rickert said if the drones don't work over the long term, she might have to close the business, which she's been involved in since at least the 1980s. She wants permission to shoot wolves if they're attacking her animals or if they come onto her property after a certain number of attacks.",
      "If the technology proves effective and costs come down, someday ranchers might merely have to ask the wolves to go away.",
      "Oregon-based Paul Wolf \u2014 yes, Wolf \u2014 is the USDA's southwest district supervisor and the main Five Finger Death Punch fan among the drone pilots. He recalled an early encounter during which a wolf at first merely seemed curious at the sight of a drone, until the pilot talked to it through the speaker.",
      "\u201cHe said, \u2018Hey wolf \u2014 get out of here,\u2019\u201d Wolf said. \u201cThe wolf immediately lets go of the cattle and runs away.\u201d",

      "\u201cToday\u2019s order is a victory for common sense,\u201d Ivey said in a statement. \u201cEvery child deserves true choice in their education and that includes their right to participate in school athletics.\u201d",
      "More than 20,000 students are participating in the state\u2019s new voucher program, called the CHOOSE Act, which went into effect this school year. It allows eligible families to tap up to $7,000 in state money to help pay for private school or to transfer to a public school, and up to $2,000 for homeschooling expenses.",
      "The Alabama High School Athletic Association did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment.",
      "The association had ruled that the CHOOSE Act provides a type of financial aid. The organization said it has a longstanding rule that any transfer student who receives financial aid \u201cis ineligible for athletic participation for one year.\u201d",

      "Murillo, 61, served as interior minister under then-interim President Jeanine \u00c1\u00f1ez, a conservative Christian senator who took power in November 2019 after former president and MAS party founder Evo Morales resigned under pressure from the military as protests disputing his reelection to a fourth term shook the country.",

      "In the days and weeks following the death of his 9-year-old daughter, Lila, at Camp Mystic in the Texas Hill Country, Blake Bonner found himself wondering whether the tragedy was simply an unstoppable act of God or something could have been done to prevent it.",
      "Lila was one of 27 Camp Mystic campers and counselors swept to their deaths when fast-rising floodwaters of the Guadalupe River roared through the girls\u2019 summer camp. All told, the destructive flooding in Texas on the Fourth of July killed at least 136 people and washed away homes and vehicles.",
      "\u201cIt just became clear to me that this incident was 100% preventable,\u201d Bonner said, \u201cand for a lot of reasons, I was going to do everything in my power, and I was hoping the other parents would as well, to make sure that our girls' legacy wasn't in vain.\u201d",
      "Bonner and many other parents and family members of the girls who died at Camp Mystic were in the Texas House and Senate gallery this week during a special session to see lawmakers give final approval to a series of bills aimed at preventing similar tragedies. Many of them shared hugs, handshakes and tears after they passed.",
      "Gov. Greg Abbott has scheduled a bill signing ceremony on Friday with legislative leaders and some of the Camp Mystic parents.",
      "The measures aim to improve the safety of children's camps by prohibiting cabins in dangerous parts of flood zones and requiring camp operators to develop detailed emergency plans, train workers and install and maintain emergency warning systems. One allocates $240 million from the state's rainy day fund for disaster relief, along with money for warning sirens and improved weather forecasting.",
      "\u201cAll the key tenets that we were looking for were addressed in these bills,\u201d Bonner said.",
      "Matthew Childress, whose 18-year-old daughter Chloe was one of two counselors killed, said the effort by the families to pursue legislation began with a bond that developed through shared grief. As they mourned together, sometimes attending other children's funerals, they grew closer.",
      "When Abbott announced plans to address flooding disaster relief as part of a special session, Childress said, some parents raised concerns that camp safety might get overlooked. Parents started becoming more organized and discussed what their priorities would be for lawmakers to consider.",

      "Federal agents conducted a surprise raid at a snack bar manufacturer in Cato, New York, taking away dozens of workers",
      "CATO, N.Y. -- Federal agents forced open the doors of a snack bar manufacturer and took away dozens of workers in a surprise enforcement action that the plant's co-owner called \u201cterrifying.\u201d",
      "Video and photos taken at the Nutrition Bar Confectioners plant Thursday showed numerous law enforcement vehicles outside the plant and workers being escorted from the building to a Border Patrol van. Immigration agents ordered everyone to a lunchroom, where they asked for proof the workers were in the country legally, according to one 24-year-old worker who was briefly detained.",
      "The reason for the enforcement action was unclear. Local law enforcement officials said the operation was led by U.S. Homeland Security Investigations, which did not respond to requests for information. Nutrition Bar Confectioners co-owner Lenny Schmidt said he was also in the dark about the purpose of the raid.",
      "\u201cThere's got to be a better way to do it,\u201d Schmidt told The Associated Press on Friday at the family-owned business in Cato, New York, about 30 miles (48 kilometers) west of Syracuse.",
      "The facility\u2019s employees had all been vetted and had legal documentation, Schmidt said, adding that he would have cooperated with law enforcement if he'd been told there were concerns.",
      "\u201cComing in like they did, it's frightening for everybody \u2014 the Latinos, Hispanics that work here, and everybody else that works here as well, even myself and my family. It's terrifying,\" he said.",
      "Cayuga County Sheriff Brian Schenck said his deputies were among those on scene Thursday morning after being asked a month ago to assist federal agencies in executing a search warrant \u201crelative to an ongoing criminal investigation.\u201d",
      "He did not detail the nature of the investigation.",
      "The lack of explanation left state Sen. Rachel May, a Democrat who represents the district, with questions.",
      "\u201cIt's not clear to me, if it's a longstanding criminal investigation, why the workers would have been rounded up,\u201d May said by phone Friday. \u201cI feel like there are things that don\u2019t quite add up.\u201d",
      "The 24-year-old worker, who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because he feared retribution, said that after he showed the agents he is a legal U.S. resident, they wrote down his information and photographed him.",
      "\u201cSome of the women started to cry because their kids were at school or at day care. It was very sad to see,\u201d said the worker, who arrived from Guatemala six years ago, then became a legal resident two years ago after working with an immigration attorney.",
      "He said his partner lacked legal status and was among those taken away.",
      "The two of them started working at the factory about two years ago. He was assigned to the snack bar wrapping department and she to the packing area. He said he couldn\u2019t talk to her before she was led away by agents and didn't know Friday where she had been detained.",

      "The deadly strike on a boat U.S. officials say was carrying drugs from Venezuela may have marked a stunning shift, but escalating pressure on the South American country has defined much of Secretary of State Marco Rubio\u2019s quarter-century in politics",
      "FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. -- The deadly strike on a boat U.S. officials say was carrying drugs from Venezuela may have marked a stunning shift in the countries\u2019 relations, but escalating pressure on the South American nation has defined much of Secretary of State Marco Rubio's quarter-century in politics.",
      "President Donald Trump\u2019s top diplomat, a former Florida senator, has depicted Venezuela as a vestige of the communist ideology in the Western Hemisphere. Rubio has consistently pushed for the ouster of its leader, Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, advocated for economic sanctions and even argued for American military intervention.",
      "\u201cI think that U.S. armed forces should only be used in cases of national security threats,\u201d he said in a 2018 interview with Univision. \u201cI think there is a strong argument that can be made right now that Venezuela and Maduro\u2019s regime have become a threat to the region and to the U.S.\u201d",
      "Before joining the administration, Rubio had represented a more interventionist wing of the Republican Party that at times seemed at odds with Trump's \u201cAmerica First\u201d ethos. While Trump has promised no more foreign wars, Rubio and other administration officials have warned of more operations against drug traffickers in Latin America, escalating pressure on an adversary Rubio has long sought to confront.",
      "\"The president has said he wants to wage war on these groups because they\u2019ve been waging war on us for 30 years and no one has responded,\u201d Rubio told reporters Thursday.",
      "Before being tapped as secretary of state and national security adviser, the Florida senator had already exerted influence over U.S. policy toward Latin America during Trump\u2019s first term.",
      "For Rubio, his interest in targeting leftist Latin American leaders has been personal. His parents are Cuban immigrants who arrived in Miami in 1956, a few years before Fidel Castro\u2019s 1959 communist revolution. He grew up in Miami, where many Cubans sought refuge after Castro's rise to power.",
      "His consistent criticism of communism has helped win him support from thousands of members of the Venezuelan diaspora who made Florida their new home to escape crime, economic deprivation and unrest under Maduro and his predecessor, the late Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, who took power in 1999 and began his self-described socialist revolution.",
      "While the U.S. has tried to move past its Cold War-era legacy of interfering and destabilizing governments in Latin America, Rubio frequently advocated for more action, going against Ch\u00e1vez and then Maduro. He tied the struggle of the opposition movement there to that of Cuban exiles.",
      "Now, \u201che sees an opportunity to move forward a much more aggressive U.S. policy toward Latin America,\u201d said Geoff Ramsey, a senior analyst on Venezuela at the Atlantic Council in Washington.",
      "Rubio shared some of the first details about the strike Tuesday despite it being a military operation, posting on social media as Trump briefly announced it in the Oval Office. The White House says 11 people were killed.",
      "A day later, he said \u201cit\u2019ll happen again\u201d and said Trump had authority \u201cunder exigent circumstances to eliminate imminent threats to the United States.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhat will stop them is when you blow them up, when you get rid of them,\u201d Rubio said Wednesday while visiting Mexico.",
      "The Defense Department said late Thursday that two Venezuelan military aircraft flew near a U.S. Navy vessel, calling it \u201ca highly provocative move\u201d and warning Maduro's government against further actions.",
      "The reaction within Trump\u2019s Make America Great Again base to the U.S. strike has been fairly muted, even supportive of it as a drug trafficking effort, unlike the divide that emerged over U.S. intervention in the Israel-Iran conflict.",
      "After Trump bested Rubio in the 2016 GOP primary and later took office in 2017, Rubio became a shadow adviser and was the main driver of sanctions against top-level Venezuelan officials for human rights abuses and ties to drug trafficking.",

      "In the Senate, many of Rubio\u2019s televised floor speeches and official statements focused on Venezuela. In 2019, he said there was a \u201ccompelling argument\u201d that the situation in Venezuela presented a national security threat to the United States, citing the presence of Russian President Vladimir Putin's military.",
      "\u201cThe enormous majority of Americans do not want Vladimir\u2019s military anywhere in our hemisphere, and that\u2019s precisely what will happen if Maduro remains in power,\" he said. \u201cThat alone is a national security threat to the United States.\u201d",
      "Many believed Rubio was among the voices that urged Trump to back an opposition leader to unseat Maduro.",
      "In 2019, as Venezuelan forces were quelling unrest and an opposition leader urged other countries to intervene, Rubio posted a series of tweets showing before-and-after images of toppled leaders such as Libya\u2019s Moammar Gadhafi, who was killed by opposition fighters in 2011, and Panama\u2019s Manuel Noriega, who was ousted in a U.S. invasion in 1989.",
      "\u201cHistory is full of examples of tyrants who believe they are invulnerable & then face sudden collapse,\u201d he tweeted afterward.",
      "The U.S. is among several countries that do not recognize Maduro as Venezuela\u2019s president, with credible evidence that he lost last year\u2019s election.",
      "The bounty on Maduro's head also has surged. After he was indicted in Manhattan federal court in 2020 on charges of narcoterrorism and conspiracy to import cocaine, the U.S. offered a $15 million reward for his arrest. The Biden administration later raised it to $25 million \u2014 the same amount offered for the capture of Osama bin Laden.",
      "The Trump administration has doubled that reward to $50 million.",
      "\u201cMaduro is NOT the President of Venezuela and his regime is NOT the legitimate government,\u201d Rubio posted on X shortly before that Aug. 7 announcement.",
      "Maduro has described Rubio as the direct architect of the U.S. buildup of warships in the region before this week's strike.",
      "\u201cMr. President Donald Trump, you have to be careful because Marco Rubio wants your hands stained with blood, with South American blood, Caribbean blood, Venezuelan blood,\u201d Maduro told reporters this week.",
      "The Venezuelan leader said his government maintains two lines of communication with the Trump administration, one with the State Department and another with Trump\u2019s envoy for special missions, Richard Grenell.",
      "Grenell's side appears to take a more conciliatory approach, seen when the U.S. allowed oil producer Chevron to resume drilling in Venezuela and in the coordination of prisoner exchanges and deportation flights with Maduro\u2019s government.",
      "\u201cI think the administration is internally divided about Venezuela,\u201d said Elliott Abrams, who served as special representative for Venezuela under Trump\u2019s first term and said Grenell is advocating for a softer stance. \u201cI think Rubio is pushing for a hard line against Maduro, and he wins some, and he loses some.\u201d",

She\u2019s accused of fatally shooting agent David Maland in Vermont on Jan. 20, the same day President Donald Trump was inaugurated and signed a sweeping executive order lifting the moratorium on federal executions.",
      "Youngblut initially was charged with using a deadly weapon against law enforcement and discharging a firearm during an assault with a deadly weapon, crimes that were not punishable by the death penalty. But the Trump administration signaled early on that more serious charges were coming as part of its push for more federal executions, and a new indictment released last month charged her with murder of a federal law enforcement agent, assaulting other agents with a deadly weapon and related firearms offenses.",
      "Youngblut is scheduled to be arraigned on the new charges Friday afternoon.",
      "At the time of the shooting, authorities had been watching Youngblut and her companion, Felix Bauckholt, for several days after a Vermont hotel employee reported seeing them carrying guns and wearing black tactical gear. She\u2019s accused of opening fire on border agents who pulled the car over on Interstate 91. An agent fired back, killing Bauckholt and wounding Youngblut.",
      "The pair were among the followers of Jack LaSota, a transgender woman also known as Ziz whose online writing attracted young, highly intelligent computer scientists who shared anarchist beliefs.

      "In both states, Democratic candidates for governor are distancing themselves from their party's far-left wing \u2014 and its most divisive people and priorities \u2014 in campaigns focused on rising costs and the economy under President Donald Trump's leadership. The move reflects what some operatives see as a critical lesson from the 2024 national elections, when Democrats faced a backlash for supporting so-called \u201cwoke\u201d social policies.",
      "As Democrats race to the center, their GOP opponents in both Democratic-leaning states are largely unwilling to separate themselves from Trump, his controversial policies or his \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d supporters. Trump\u2019s GOP continues to rally around him, shrugging off low approval ratings and opposition to his federal workforce cuts that have especially affected Virginia. That\u2019s even as the Republican candidates hope to attract independents and even moderate Democrats to win in November.",
      "It is a delicate balance, and one that could inform both parties' strategies a year before midterm elections that will decide control of Congress.",
      "The majority of voters in New Jersey, as in the nation, are not happy with Trump.",
      "An AP-NORC poll conducted in August found that 45% of U.S. adults approve of Trump\u2019s performance as president. And just 37% of likely New Jersey voters approved of Trump\u2019s job performance in a late July Fairleigh Dickinson University poll.",
      "That\u2019s not to say Trump doesn't have supporters in New Jersey, a working-class state he lost by 6 percentage points last fall compared with 16 points four years earlier.",
      "New Jersey Republican candidate for governor, former state Assemblyman Jack Ciattarelli, was once a Trump critic. But Ciattarelli, who faces Democratic Rep. Mikie Sherrill, has embraced the president in the 2025 election. Ciattarelli won Trump's endorsement, backed his budget bill and declined to name any issues where they disagree. It's unclear, however, if he wants to campaign alongside Trump in New Jersey before Election Day.",
      "Ciattarelli told reporters Thursday that his campaign is actively working with the White House to get Trump involved. But, reflecting the delicate politics, he declined to say whether Trump might visit the state in person or participate in a tele-town hall or robocalls.",

      "\u201cWhen you ask me about the president\u2019s agenda, I am going to support his agenda when it comes to crime every single day,\u201d Earle-Sears told the AP.",
      "An Earle-Sears spokesperson sent a follow-up statement after the interview: \u201cEveryone knows Winsome Earle-Sears is fiercely independent, but she also knows when strong leadership delivers results. Winsome isn\u2019t afraid to say it \u2014 when Trump puts America first, Virginians win.\u201d A spokesperson later told the AP that Earle-Sears would welcome Trump on the campaign trail in Virginia.",
      "Still, Earle-Sears expressed frustration that her opponents paint her as overly aligned with the White House or too far-right for Virginia. She argued that her opponent, former Rep. Abigail Spanberger, hasn\u2019t been tethered to former Democratic President Joe Biden the same way.",

      "IRVING, Texas -- Crowded around a workshop table, four girls at de Zavala Middle School puzzled over a Lego machine they had built. As they flashed a purple card in front of a light sensor, nothing happened.",
      "The teacher at the Dallas-area school had emphasized that in the building process, there is no such thing as mistakes. Only iterations. So the girls dug back into the box of blocks and pulled out an orange card. They held it over the sensor and the machine kicked into motion.",

      "In de Zavala\u2019s first year as a choice school focused on science, technology, engineering and math, the school recruited a sixth grade class that\u2019s half girls. School leaders are hoping the girls will stick with STEM fields. In de Zavala\u2019s higher grades \u2014 whose students joined before it was a STEM school \u2014 some elective STEM classes have just one girl enrolled.",

      "In the years leading up to the pandemic, the gender gap nearly closed. But within a few years, girls lost all the ground they had gained in math test scores over the previous decade, according to an Associated Press analysis. While boys' scores also suffered during COVID, they have recovered faster than girls, widening the gender gap.",
      "As learning went online, special programs to engage girls lapsed \u2014 and schools were slow to restart them. Zoom school also emphasized rote learning, a technique based on repetition that some experts believe may favor boys, instead of teaching students to solve problems in different ways, which may benefit girls.",

It was based on average test scores for third through eighth graders in 33 states, compiled by the Educational Opportunity Project at Stanford University.",
      "A decade later, girls had not only caught up, they were ahead: Slightly more than half of districts had higher math averages for girls.",
      "Within a few years of the pandemic, the parity disappeared. In 2023-2024, boys on average outscored girls in math in nearly nine out of 10 districts.",

Girls outperformed boys in reading in nearly every district nationwide before the pandemic and continued to do so afterward.",

Through new curriculum standards, schools moved toward research-backed methods that emphasized how to think flexibly to solve problems and how to tackle numeric problems conceptually.",

      "When STEM courses had large male enrollment, Superintendent Kenny Rodrequez noticed girls losing interest as boys dominated classroom discussions at his schools in Grandview C-4 District outside Kansas City. Girls were significantly more engaged after the district moved some of its introductory hands-on STEM curriculum to the lower grade levels and balanced classes by gender, he said.",

      "President Donald Trump says the U.S. will host next year\u2019s Group of 20 summit at his golf club in southern Florida",
      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump said Friday that the U.S. will host next year\u2019s Group of 20 summit at his golf club in Doral, Florida, arguing it was \u201cthe best location\u201d for the high-stakes international gathering but insisting his family's business \"will not make any money on it.\u201d",
      "In his first term, Trump tried to host a separate global summit at the club, but backed down after criticism from his own party about the propriety of doing so. Now, though, Trump rarely travels domestically without golfing at or staying in properties bearing his name and has faced very little political blowback.",
      "Trump's sons have taken over running the Trump Organization while their father is in the White House. But the president has nonetheless prided himself in blurring the line between domestic and global policy and generating profits for the Trump brand.",
      "He's actively promoted his $TRUMP meme coin and even hosted the top 220 investors in it for a swanky dinner in May at his golf property in Virginia. The president made his first foreign trip to Saudi Arabia, after his sons crisscrossed the region drumming up business for the family's other cryptocurrency ventures. Trump also went to Scotland to inaugurate his new golf course there.",
      "The G20 is made up of some of the world\u2019s major economies, the European Union and the African Union. Hosting the G20 at Doral would be an especially striking example of using the presidency to enrich his family, but Trump wasted little time defending it.",
      "\u201cI think everybody wants it there,\u201d he said when asked if the global summit would be at his golf club and spa. Trump noted that the conference would be occurring in December 2026, a time of year when hotels in South Florida are often more full, and said that Doral had the space and was ideally suited because of its close proximity to the city\u2019s airport.",
      "The United States hasn't hosted a G20 since it was held in Pittsburgh in 2009. The president suggested that organizers had requested the summit be at his property, but didn\u2019t elaborate. He said each delegation from different countries \u201cwill have its own building.\u201d",

      "Ryan Lee has turned his love of mahjong into a thriving social scene in San Francisco",
      "San Francisco -- When Ryan Lee first played mahjong two years ago, he got hooked. He dug out sets of the classic Chinese tile game from his parents\u2019 house and brought them to San Francisco, where he started hosting mahjong nights in his apartment.",
      "The gatherings became so popular that the 25-year-old Chinese American began hosting pop-up mahjong parties in restaurants, bars and nightclubs around San Francisco.",
      "Mahjong, invented in 19th century China, is gaining popularity with a new generation of players looking to get off their phones and socialize in the real world.",
      "Lee\u2019s Youth Luck Leisure (YLL) Mahjong Club now hosts bimonthly parties with up to 30 tables and 200 guests. They attract a diverse, young crowd drawn to the festive atmosphere, live DJs, custom cocktails and chance to meet new friends. Instructors are on hand to teach novices.",
      "\u201cA lot of people are just really intrigued even though they don\u2019t really know how to play,\u201d Lee said. \u201cThere\u2019s a cultural component they\u2019re trying to connect with. It\u2019s kind of like a cultural nostalgia.\u201d",
      "Eventbrite reports there was a 179% increase in U.S. mahjong events on its platform from 2023 to 2024.",
      "There's been a 179% increase in mahjong events in the U.S. from 2023 to 2024, according to Eventbrite, a popular ticketing app. The event platform says Gen Z is also showing a growing interest in other \u201cgrannycore\u201d activities such as baking workshops and needlework circles that happen offline.",
      "In mahjong, four players draw and discard tiles with different suits, numbers and Chinese characters. The object is to build a winning hand of four sets of three and one pair.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a really tactile game, and it\u2019s really a social game. It really easily builds community among people,\u201d said Nicole Wong, a writer and audio producer in Oakland. \u201cIt\u2019s a good way to unplug and not just be on your phone.\u201d",
      "Wong learned how to play when she visited her Chinese grandparents in New Zealand in 2009. Several years ago she found her parents\u2019 mahjong table and game sets, and started hosting mahjong nights with her friends.",
      "In 2019, she launched The Mahjong Project, an instructional guide and oral history project inspired by her family\u2019s love of the game. That led her to publish \u201cMahjong: House Rules from Across the Asian Diaspora,\u201d an illustrated book that explores the game\u2019s history, strategies, traditions and styles of play.",

      "Scientists conducting a first-of-its-kind drilling operation have extracted samples of fresh water hiding in massive reservoirs deep under the ocean",
      "ABOARD LIFTBOAT ROBERT, North Atlantic -- Deep in Earth's past, an icy landscape became a seascape as the ice melted and the oceans rose off what is now the northeastern United States. Nearly 50 years ago, a U.S. government ship searching for minerals and hydrocarbons in the area drilled into the seafloor to see what it could find.",
      "It found, of all things, drops to drink under the briny deeps \u2014 fresh water.",
      "This summer, a first-of-its-kind global research expedition followed up on that surprise. Drilling for fresh water under the salt water off Cape Cod, Expedition 501 extracted thousands of samples from what is now thought to be a massive, hidden aquifer stretching from New Jersey as far north as Maine.",
      "It's just one of many depositories of \u201csecret fresh water\u201d known to exist in shallow salt waters around the world that might some day be tapped to slake the planet\u2019s intensifying thirst, said Brandon Dugan, the expedition's co-chief scientist.",
      "\u201cWe need to look for every possibility we have to find more water for society,\u201d Dugan, a geophysicist and hydrologist at the Colorado School of Mines, told Associated Press journalists who recently spent 12 hours on the drilling platform. The research teams looked in \u201cone of the last places you would probably look for fresh water on Earth.\u201d",
      "They found it, and will be analyzing nearly 50,000 liters (13,209 gallons) of it back in their labs around the world in the coming months. They're out to solve the mystery of its origins \u2014 whether the water is from glaciers, connected groundwater systems on land or some combination.",
      "The potential is enormous. So are the hurdles of getting the water out and puzzling over who owns it, who uses it and how to extract it without undue harm to nature. It's bound to take years to bring that water ashore for public use in a big way, if it's even feasible.",
      "Why try? In just five years, the U.N. says, the global demand for fresh water will exceed supplies by 40%. Rising sea levels from the warming climate are souring coastal freshwater sources while data centers that power AI and cloud computing are consuming water at an insatiable rate.",
      "The fabled Ancient Mariner\u2019s lament, \u201cWater, water, every where, nor any drop to drink,\u201d looms as a warning to landlubbers as well as to sailors on salty seas.",
      "In Virginia alone, a quarter of all power produced in the state goes to data centers, a share expected to nearly double in five years. By some estimates, each midsize data center consumes as much water as 1,000 households. Each of the Great Lakes states has experienced groundwater shortages.",
      "Cape Town, South Africa, came perilously close to running out of fresh water for its nearly 5 million people in 2018 during an epic, three-year drought. South Africa is thought to have a coastal undersea freshwater bonanza, too, and there is at least anecdotal evidence that every continent may have the same.",
      "Canada's Prince Edward Island, Hawaii and Jakarta, Indonesia, are among places where stressed freshwater supplies coexist with prospective aquifers under the ocean.",
      "Enter Expedition 501, a $25 million scientific collaboration of more than a dozen countries backed by the U.S. government's National Science Foundation and the European Consortium for Ocean Research Drilling (U.S. money for it was secured before budget cuts sought by the Trump administration).",
      "Scientists went into the project believing the undersea aquifer they were sampling might be sufficient to meet the needs of a metropolis the size of New York City for 800 years. They found fresh or nearly fresh water at both higher and lower depths below the seafloor than they anticipated, suggesting a larger supply even than that.",
      "Their work at sea unfolded over three months from Liftboat Robert, an oceangoing vessel that, once on site, lowers three enormous pillars to the seafloor and squats above the waves. Normally it services offshore petroleum sites and wind farms. This drill-baby-drill mission was different.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s known that this phenomena exists both here and elsewhere around the world,\u201d Expedition 501 project manager Jez Everest, a scientist who came from the British Geological Survey in Edinburgh, Scotland, said of undersea water. \u201cBut it\u2019s a subject that\u2019s never been directly investigated by any research project in the past.\u201d",
      "By that, he means no one globally had drilled systematically into the seabed on a mission to find freshwater. Expedition 501 was quite literally groundbreaking \u2014 it penetrated Earth below the sea by as many as 1,289 feet or nearly 400 meters.",
      "But it followed a 2015 research project that mapped contours of an aquifer remotely, using electromagnetic technology, and roughly estimated salinity of the water underneath.",
      "That mission, by the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution and Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory at Columbia University, reported evidence of a \u201cmassive offshore aquifer system\u201d in this area, possibly rivalling the size of America\u2019s largest \u2014 the Ogallala aquifer, which supplies water to parts of eight Great Plains states.",
      "Two developments in 1976 had stirred interest in searching for undersea freshwater.",
      "In the middle of Nantucket island, the U.S. Geological Survey drilled a test well to see how far down the groundwater went. It extracted fresh water from such great depths that it made scientists wonder if the water came from the sea, not the sky.",
      "The same year, that federal agency mounted a 60-day expedition aboard the drilling vessel Glomar Conception along a vast stretch of the Continental Shelf from Georgia to Georges Bank off New England. It drilled cores in search of the sub-seabed's resources, like methane.",

      "Soon after Robert arrived at the first of three drilling sites May 19, samples drawn from below the seabed registered salinity of just 4 parts per thousand. That's far below the oceans' average salt content of 35 parts per thousand but still too briny to meet the U.S. freshwater standard of under 1 part per thousand.",
      "\u201cFour parts per thousand was a eureka moment,\" Dugan said, because the finding suggested that the water must have been connected to a terrestrial system in the past, or still is.",
      "As the weeks wore on and Robert moved from site to site 20 to 30 miles (30 to 50 kilometers) off the coast, the process of drilling into the waterlogged subsea sediment yielded a collection of samples down to 1 part per thousand salt content. Some were even lower.",
      "Bingo. That's what you find in many bodies of fresh water on land. That's water you can drink, in theory. No one did.",
      "In months of analysis ahead, the scientists will investigate a range of properties of the water, including what microbes were living in the depths, what they used for nutrients and energy sources and what byproducts they might generate; in other words, whether the water is safe to consume or otherwise use.",
      "\u201cThis is a new environment that has never been studied before,\u201d said Jocelyne DiRuggiero, a Johns Hopkins University biologist in Baltimore who studies the microbial ecology of extreme environments and is not involved in the expedition.",
      "\u201cThe water may contain minerals detrimental to human health since it percolated through layers of sediments,\u201d she said. \u201cHowever, a similar process forms the terrestrial aquifers that we use for freshwater, and those typically have very high quality.\u201d",
      "By sequencing DNA extracted from their samples, she said, the researchers can determine which microorganisms are there and \u201clearn how they potentially make a living.\u201d",
      "Techniques will also be used to determine whether it came from glacial ice melt thousands of years ago or is still coming via labyrinthian geologic formations from land.",
      "Researchers will date the water back in the lab, and that will be key in determining whether it is a renewable resource that could be used responsibly. Primordial water is trapped and finite; newer water suggests the aquifer is still connected to a terrestrial source and being refreshed, however slowly.",
      "\u201cYounger means it was a raindrop 100 years ago, 200 years ago,\u201d Dugan said. \u201cIf young, it\u2019s recharging.\u201d",
      "Those questions are for basic science. For society, all sorts of complex questions arise if the basic science affirms the conditions necessary for exploiting the water. Who will manage it? Can it be taken without an unacceptable risk of contaminating the supply from the ocean above? Will it be cheaper or environmentally friendlier than today's energy-hungry desalination plants?",
      "Dugan said if governments decide to get the water, local communities could turn to the aquifers in time of need, such as drought, or when extreme storms flood coastal freshwater reserves and ruin them. The notion of actually using this old buried water is so new that it has not been on the radar of many policymakers or conservationists.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a lesson in how long it can take sometimes to make these things happen and the perseverance that\u2019s needed to get there,\" said Woods Hole geophysicist Rob Evans, whose 2015 expedition helped point the way for 501. \u201cThere\u2019s a ton of excitement that finally they\u2019ve got samples.\"",
      "Still, he sees some red flags. One is that tapping undersea aquifers could draw water away from onshore reserves. Another is that undersea groundwater that seeps out to the seafloor may supply nutrients vital to the ecosystem, and that could be upset.",
      "\"If we were to go out and start pumping these waters, there would almost certainly be unforeseen consequences,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of balance we would need to consider before we started diving in and drilling and exploiting these kinds of things.\u201d",
      "For most in the project, getting to and from Liftboat Robert meant a voyage of seven hours or more from Fall River, Massachusetts, on a supply boat that made round trips every 10 days or so to replenish stocks and rotate people.",
      "On the platform, around the clock, the racket of metal bore pipes and machinery, the drilling grime and the speckled mud mingled with the quieter, cleaner work of scientists in trailers converted to pristine labs and processing posts.",
      "There, samples were treated according to the varying needs of the expedition\u2019s geologists, geochemists, hydrologists, microbiologists, sedimentologists and more.",
      "Passing through clear plastic tubes, muck was sliced into disks like hockey pucks. Machines squeezed water out. Some samples were kept sealed to enable study of ancient gases dissolved in the water. Other samples were frozen, filtered or left as is, depending on the purpose.",
      "After six months of lab analysis, all the science teams of Expedition 501 will meet again \u2014 this time in Germany for a month of collaborative research that is expected to produce initial findings that point to the age and origin of the water.",
      "On July 31, Liftboat Robert cranked up its legs from this place of hidden water to end a mission that lent credence to another passage from \u201cThe Rime of the Ancient Mariner,\" Samuel Taylor Coleridge's classic poem about life, death and mysteries at sea.",

PETERSBURG, Fla. -- Dr. Joseph Ladapo, whose credentials include two Harvard University degrees, says that requiring vaccinations for diseases like measles, polio and chickenpox amounts to government-imposed \u201cslavery.\u201d It\u2019s far from the first time Florida\u2019s surgeon general has cut against the medical establishment grain.",
      "Ladapo, an appointee of Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis, made worldwide headlines this week by announcing Florida would seek to eliminate all mandated vaccinations for schoolchildren and others. He cast the immunization requirements, which date back decades and are considered a major global medical achievement that has saved millions of lives, as improper government intrusion in personal health decisions.",
      "\u201cEvery last one is wrong and drips with disdain and slavery,\" Ladapo said at a news conference with DeSantis this week. \u201cWho am I, or anyone else, to tell you what you should put in your body? Who am I to tell you what your child should put in their body? I don\u2019t have that right.\u201d",
      "So far, a concrete action plan for eliminating immunization mandates in Florida has not emerged, despite multiple requests by The Associated Press. Ladapo acknowledged some proposed changes would require the state Legislature to act. Educators and many health professionals are aghast.",
      "\u201cRemoving policies that keep our children healthy creates unnecessary confusion and fear,\u201d said Dr. Rana Alissa, president of the Florida Chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics. \u201cSchools are tight-knit networks of children, educators, and families, making it easy for contagious diseases to spread.\"",
      "Ladapo, 46, emigrated from Nigeria to the U.S. at age five with his parents. He earned a degree in chemistry from Wake Forest University and then attended Harvard, where he got his medical degree and also a doctorate in health policy.",
      "This is a well-trodden path for medical expertise. Ladapo was affiliated after Harvard with New York University and later UCLA, where his op-eds against the pandemic response were noticed by DeSantis, who tapped him as Florida surgeon general in 2021. Ladapo also got a professor position at the University of Florida medical school in the deal.",
      "Like the governor, Ladapo raised questions about COVID-19 policies that forced people to wear masks and move education online, keep their distance from others and show proof of COVID vaccinations to attend public events, go to a restaurant or take a cruise. Ladapo also misrepresented studies to raise doubts about the mRNA vaccine, the studies' authors said.",
      "In a 2024 guidance statement, Ladapo's Department of Health warned against using the COVID vaccine at all, contending that \u201cthe federal government has failed to provide sufficient data to support the safety and efficacy of COVID-19 boosters, or acknowledge previously demonstrated safety concerns associated with COVID-19 vaccines and boosters.\u201d Those purported risks include respiratory tract infections, greater chance of autoimmune disease and cardiovascular problems.",
      "Almost every major medical or public health organization disputed those assertions, including the Food and Drug Administration: \u201cThe challenge we continue to face is the ongoing proliferation of misinformation and disinformation about these vaccines which results in vaccine hesitancy that lowers vaccine uptake,\u201d said the FDA statement, adding that the agency \u201crespectfully disagrees with the Florida Surgeon General\u2019s opinion.\u201d",
      "In his public comments, Ladapo makes clear he does not follow the guidance of government health experts who, in his view, don't look at the full picture of how to tackle disease and improve public health. His agency did not respond to an Associated Press request for an interview.",

Childhood vaccines save lives,\u201d Wilson posted on social media this week. \u201cGovernor DeSantis must either remove Joseph Ladapo as Surgeon General or have him resign.\u201d",

      "\u201cThere are many brave people out there \u2014 moms & dads, doctors, scientists, and others \u2014 who have shown admirable courage in the fight for medical freedom,\u201d Ladapo posted recently on the X social media platform. \u201cLet's continue. Much more work to be done.\u201d",

      "Gibson said she thinks her mother is also responsible for helping young female artists of today.",
      "\"I think artists know their audience, but back then, it was the male power play and it was those men kind of dictating what young girls wore and who wrote their songs and \u2026 my mom went into those conference rooms and I remember vividly her pounding her fists on that table \u2026 fighting, saying my daughter can produce,\" she said.",

    "published": "Fri, 05 Sep 2025 09:37:00 -0400",
    "summary": "A Mike Tyson-Floyd Mayweather fight was announced Thursday. But there are multiple questions surrounding the bout.",
    "story": [
      "The boxing world was hit with a big announcement on Thursday night when former heavyweight champion Mike Tyson and former multi-division champion Floyd Mayweather said they\u00a0agreed to a bout to be held in the spring of 2026.",
      "Details on a date, location, television partner and any potential professional sanctioning of the bout were not immediately released, though both Hall-of-Fame boxers appeared excited about the fight in a press release distributed by CSI Sports.",
      "\"I still can't believe Floyd wants to really do this,\" Tyson said in the release. \"It's going to be detrimental to his health, but he wants to do it, so it's signed and it's happening!\"",
      "\"I've been doing this for 30 years and there hasn't been a single fighter that can tarnish my legacy,\" Mayweather said. \"You already know that if I am going to do something, it's going to be big and it's going to be legendary. I'm the best in the business of boxing. This exhibition will give the fans what they want.\"",
      "Coming Soon pic.twitter.com/lSeyrR0BKO",
      "While Mayweather noted that the bout would be an exhibition, meaning it wouldn't be sanctioned by an athletic commission or count toward either fighter's professional record, this was not confirmed by the fight promoters. But the sanctioning of the bout is just one of multiple outstanding questions surrounding this clash between two of the biggest names in boxing history. Below, we'll break down a few others.",
      "Will it be a professional, sanctioned bout?",
      "This is arguably the biggest question surrounding the bout but it's unlikely to be professionally sanctioned, despite the fact that Tyson just fought his first professional fight in 19 years when he lost to Jake Paul last November. Mayweather has had multiple exhibition bouts since retiring in 2017 following a knockout win against Conor McGregor. But he hasn't fought professionally since then, when he left the ring with a perfect 50-0 record. Mayweather indicated that the fight with Tyson will be an exhibition but he did not immediately respond to a CBS News request for further comment.",
      "What weight class would the fight be held in?",
      "This will largely depend on whether the bout is professional or an exhibition. If it's the former, then the boxers will need to agree on a weight limit that they would both be held to. But if it's an exhibition, which seems to be the case, it's likely that both boxers will enter the ring around the weight they last fought at. That means Mayweather would be around the middleweight limit, while Tyson is likely to be around the 220-pound range he often fought at as a champion in the 1980s and 1990s. Tyson tipped the scales at 230 pounds for his fight with Paul 10 months ago.",
      "Would the fight be held under non-standard rules?",
      "Whether it's a pro fight or an exhibition, there may be other, non-standardized rules in play here. Tyson is 59 years old. Mayweather is 48 years old. Boxers in that age range, when they do enter the ring, tend to perform under different rules and regulations. When Tyson fought Paul last fall, for example, the length of the rounds was reduced to two minutes from the standard three. And it was limited to an eight-round fight, when it normally would have been 10 for a non-championship affair. Both boxers also wore heavier gloves in the bout than is the norm, which is likely to be the case for a Tyson-Mayweather affair, too.",
      "Is this a new trend in boxing?",
      "Boxing exhibitions featuring retired champions is nothing new to the sport. Mayweather and former foe Manny Pacquiao have done so multiple times in recent years. While it may not be a boxing purist's preference, it's not unusual.",
      "What is a bit unique, however, is that this will be Tyson's third fight in approximately six years, after retiring from the sport in 2005. He fought an exhibition against former champion Roy Jones, Jr. in 2020 and Paul last November. Paul, meanwhile, who boxed Tyson as a heavyweight, appears to be moving on to his own exhibition fight against former lightweight champion Gervonta Davis, in an another match between boxers in wildly different weight classes. That fight was\u00a0announced for Nov. 14.",

    "summary": "Fans have been eager to learn everything they can ever since Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce announced their engagement in a joint post.",
    "story": [
      "A bejeweled Taylor Swift broke Instagram records in August as the pop star and Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce announced their engagement in a joint post.",
      "Fans have been eager to learn everything they can about the engagement into the lead-up to this TBD white veil occasion.",
      "Here's what we know so far about your English teacher and gym teacher's engagement:",
      "When did Swift and Kelce get engaged?",
      "The couple announced their engagement on Aug. 26, 13 days after Swift's \"New Heights\" episode dropped. Fans were quick to speculate about when Kelce popped the question \u2014 and they didn't have to wait long before getting a timeline from Kelce's dad Ed, who told News 5 Cleveland that the couple got engaged roughly two weeks earlier.",
      "Ed said he was at the Philadelphia Eagles' public practice on Aug. 10 when he got a FaceTime from the newly engaged couple. He told \"The Jimmy & Nath Show\" that Travis had planned to propose next weekend.",
      "\"He was going to make a big production out of it,\" Ed shared, explaining that Travis wanted it to be \"uber special.\"",
      "\"And I told him the same thing [Swift's dad] Scott told him: Asking her is what's going to make it special, not where you do it. You could do it on the side of the road.\"",
      "Ed said Swift's dad told him to \"just get it done.\"",
      "Where did Kelce pop the question?",
      "Kelce proposed on the grounds of his $6 million Missouri home, which he purchased back in 2023. The engagement photos show a dramatic display of flowers adorning an arch and surrounding the couple.",
      "Florist Ashley Greer told People Magazine that the \"enchanted garden\" scene, which featured thousands of flowers, likely cost nearly $40,000. Also featured \u2014 ivy and willow, a likely nod to two songs off Swift's ninth studio album, \"evermore.\"",
      "What do we know about the ring?",
      "Kelce skipped the paper rings and went for a custom old mine brilliant cut in a yellow gold bezel setting. Swift's representative said New York based goldsmith Kindred Lubeck, who specializes in hand engraving, designed the ring.",
      "Old mine brilliant cuts are often boxy shaped with rounded corners and soft curved edges. They usually have 58 large facets and the style dates to the 18th century. The bulky nature of the cut was intended to sparkle by candlelight.",
      "Where it all began",
      "As Swifties and Chief fans alike already know, their relationship began after Kelce's failed attempt to meet Swift at Arrowhead Stadium. He talked about the show in a July 2023 episode of his \"New Heights\" podcast, telling his brother Jason Kelce that he was disappointed that he wasn't able to give her a friendship bracelet he had made with his number on it.",
      "After the episode aired, Swift heard from people close to Kelce, including Chiefs coach Andy Reid, encouraging her to reach out to him. And the rest is history.",
      "On Swift's episode of the \"New Heights\" podcast, which aired Aug. 13 and smashed Guinness World records, she said the friendship bracelet gesture made her feel like she was in a 1980s John Hughes movie.",
      "\"[It's like] he was just standing outside of my window with a boombox just being like, 'I want to date you! Do you want to go on a date with me? I made you a friendship bracelet! Do you want to date me?'\" she said. \"I was like, 'If this guy isn't crazy \u2026 this is sort of what I've been writing songs about wanting to happen to me since I was a teenager.'\"",
      "\"This podcast has done a lot for me,\" she said. \"This podcast got me a boyfriend.\"",
      "Kelce opens up about engagement",
      "On a \"New Heights\" episode that dropped Sept. 3, Kelce spoke about the engagement for this first time, saying, \"It's been so much fun hearing from everybody, seeing the internet go crazy.\"",
      "Kelce said the word \"fianc\u00e9\" hits different for him now. Days after the proposal, Kelce and Swift watched his alma mater, the Cincinnati Bearcats, play at Arrowhead Stadium.",
      "\"I felt that at the game, it was my first time introducing Taylor as my fianc\u00e9e to a few of my teammates \u2014 so yeah, it was pretty cool,\" he told his brother on the podcast. \"I still get giddy \u2026 It's exciting times.\"",

      "Chapel Hill, N.C. \u2014 North Carolina's high-point moment in its first game under coach Bill Belichick came early.",
      "A festive pregame atmosphere led to a roar from the crowd at kickoff. And a season-opening drive moved at a crisp pace to the end zone.",
      "After that, well, Monday night's hyped-up debut turned into a romp by TCU - along with a reminder that even an NFL icon with six Super Bowl titles as a head coach can't just magically turn the Tar Heels into winners after decades of also-ran status.",
      "\"We played competitively but then just couldn't sustain it,\" Belichick said in the familiar low tone from his NFL news conferences after the 48-14 loss. \"Obviously, we have a lot of work to do. We need to do a better job all the way around \u2014 coaching, playing, all three phases of the game.\"",
      "CBSSports.com's Shehan Jeyarajah points out\u00a0that, \"The NFL is generally a defensive league where teams are close to evenly matched. At the college level, Belichick will come to understand just how big the talent differentials are between the good and bad teams \u2014 and he was on the wrong end.\"",
      "The blowout put a major damper on a night buzzing with optimism for the 73-year-old Belichick's college debut, only to see the Horned Frogs dominate so thoroughly they drove UNC fans to the Kenan Stadium exits by midway through the third quarter.",
      "\"It was a great environment tonight,\" Belichick said. \"I mean, the fans were awesome. There was great energy in the stadium. We just didn't do enough to keep it going. We've got to play better for the energy to be sustainable.\"",
      "By the end of the game, Kenan was a ghost town and the Tar Heels had given up more points than in any previous opener in their history, according to Sportradar.",
      "It was a jarring result, even amid uncertainty as to exactly what to expect from UNC with roughly 70 new players between transfers and incoming recruits. There were few highlights after that opening drive beyond Kaleb Cost's athletic reeling in of a deflected ball for an interception and quarterback Max Johnson returning in relief from a serious leg injury sustained in last year's opener at Minnesota.",
      "\"We're just moving forward, just moving forward,\" said Cost, offering an unintentional callback to Belichick's famous \"We're on to Cincinnati\" response to reporters' questions after a blowout loss to the Kansas City Chiefs in 2014.",
      "UNC was picked to finish eighth in the 17-team Atlantic Coast Conference, though that seemed almost entirely predicated on Belichick's mere presence. This is a man, after all, who teamed with legendary quarterback Tom Brady to win six world titles in his 24-year run with the New England Patriots. Someone who won more regular-season and playoff games in the NFL (333) than anyone other than Don Shula.",
      "So there was spectacle to Belichick's debut as he took the field sporting a familiar look from the pro sideline with a gray hoodie - only this one bearing the name \"Carolina Football\" in that distinctive shade of light blue.",
      "An estimated 5,000 fans packed onto a main campus quad for a pregame concert and throngs lined the team's walk to Kenan, where UNC has sold out all its season tickets \u2014 at an elevated price with Belichick's arrival \u2014 and single-game seats for the season. The game attracted ESPN to hold a pregame studio show from the sideline with a crew that included former Alabama coach Nick Saban, with Belichick popping over briefly to say hello.",
      "There were notable former UNC athletes from years past, including NBA legend Michael Jordan \u2014 who won a national championship under Dean Smith here in 1982 \u2014 and former UNC star linebacker Lawrence Taylor, who played under Belichick when he was an assistant and eventually defensive coordinator with the New York Giants during the 1980s.",
      "And it wasn't hard to spot Jordon Hudson \u2014 Belichick's 24-year-old girlfriend who has generated her own tabloid-level curiosity \u2014 as she walked the pregame sideline sporting Carolina blue pants shimmering with sequins-like additions on the legs.",
      "Belichick roamed the field during pregame warmups for the better part of a half-hour. At one point, he stood on the UNC end of the field with general manager Michael Lombardi, then shared a quick handshake with ACC commissioner Jim Phillips as he made his way toward midfield.",
      "Once there, Belichick shook hands with members of the officiating crew and watched the Horned Frogs warm up.",
      "The Tar Heels got off to a sprint of a start with an 83-yard drive that ended with Caleb Hood scoring through the right side from 8 yards out, followed by forcing a quick punt. But things soon started getting away.",
      "TCU \u2014 which lost in a similar scenario as the \"other\" team in Deion Sanders' debut at Colorado two years ago \u2014 never looked rattled or thrown. Bud Clark provided a highlight by jumping Gio Lopez's sideline throw for an easy 25-yard pick-six as TCU took a 20-7 lead into the break.",

    "published": "Sun, 31 Aug 2025 10:36:53 -0400",
    "summary": "One of the founding members of Creedence Clearwater Revival lost control of his own songs when the band broke up in the early 1970s. Now, after buying back rights to his Creedence catalog, John Fogerty has come back to his music, recording the album \"Legacy.\"",
    "story": [
      "\"It was life and death,\" said musician John Fogerty. \"I used to tell myself that phrase: 'This is life and death.' You're against the whole world.\"",
      "He felt that as a young man: \"Yes, oh yes. I mean, there's a million records out there. It's me against everybody that's every recorded and ever will record. You've got to do a great job. It was either be great, or go home!\"",
      "You know how it turned out for Fogerty. \"Great\" is something of an understatement. That voice \u2026 that guitar \u2026 and those songs, so many of which became hits that are now classics. But Fogerty, who recently turned 80, says every time he steps up to the mic, he still has something to prove \u2013 and still feel a little nerve. \"Oh yeah, yeah, every time!\" he laughed. \"But I think the nerves is what gives you the edge.",
      "I asked, \"How do you do that? What's the magic there?\"",
      "\"I wish I had a really great, contrived answer for you, but I don't!\" he laughed.",
      "The answer seems quite simple when you watch Fogerty rehearse. There is love of craft, and love of family. (His sons, Shane and Tyler Fogerty, help lead his touring band.)",
      "The group that put Fogerty on the charts was Creedence Clearwater Revival, which got its start in the late 1950s. Though a native of Northern California, Fogerty soaked up the rhythms of the South, giving birth to his so-called \"swamp rock\" sound, which he honed in the mid-'60s.",
      "He recalled: \"I received my honorable discharge from the Army. And the first line I wrote was, 'Left a good job in the city, workin' for the man every night and day.' Well, of course that was the Army. I mean, it had just happened. But as I begin to strum, I started singing this phrase: 'Rollin', rollin', rollin' on the river.' And at that point I'm, Well, what is this song? What is this? And I went to this songbook that I had just started keeping, and on the very first page, the very first entry, I had written the words 'Proud Mary.'",
      "\"And I actually understood right then that I'd written a classic song, a really great, American song,\" he said. \"And a few moments later, 'Oh my God. What if I never get to do this again? What if this is the only one that ever happens, and I'm a one-hit wonder?'\"",
      "Turns out, Fogerty was anything but that. Yet, after the 1972 breakup of Creedence, his solo career became mired in legal battles. He was stunned to discover he no longer had control over the use of the songs he wrote \u2013 and a limited share of the profits.",
      "Fogerty has looked on as others have endured similar challenges, and pain. The most famous current example: Taylor Swift, who earlier this year purchased the rights to her compositions, and won back control of her music.",
      "I asked, \"If you could pull her aside, John, and give her a piece of advice about how to get over the pain of a fight over your own music, what would you tell her?\"",
      "\"Well, I don't think you get over that kind of fight,\" he replied. \"What happened to me is, I stopped touring, and I stopped singing my own songs. I don't recommend that move to anybody. You become invisible. You're just forgotten about. It's like you died.\"",
      "I asked Julie, his wife of 34 years, if she ever doubted that he would be able to pull himself out of that anger. \"I think it was more sadness than anger,\" she said. \"And all he ever wanted to do in life was make music. That was his love. That was his best friend. And having that taken away and turned so bad was really hard for me to understand.\"",
      "Fogerty gives Julie credit for turning his life around. And she encouraged him not only to buy back the rights to his Creedence catalog, but to re-record those songs with his sons.\u00a0 The result: a new album, \"Legacy: The Creedence Clearwater Revival Years (John's Version).\"",
      "Julie said, \"Having those songs and being able to put his fist in the air and go, 'I own those songs,' I couldn't think of a better gift than having him record these with friends and family.\"",
      "You can stream John Fogerty's album \"Legacy: The Creedence Clearwater Revival Years (John's Version)\" by clicking on the embed below (Free Spotify registration required to hear the tracks in full):",
      "Since they were children, sons Shane and Tyler learned guitar from their father.\u00a0 The new album is a family affair, but it's also serious business. \"I have the feeling that somehow Julie knew, she knew that at some point, the life-and-death John would kick in and I would have to roll up my sleeves,\" Fogerty said. \"'Cause that's what happened. And literally, this was kind of when the record was done, I think she told me, she said she could see me going back in time. With each one of these tracks, especially when I was doing the lead vocal, I had to remember what I felt like when I sang it the first time.\"",
      "And what a time it has been. For John Fogerty, the highs and lows have landed him here: at peace with it all, and lucky enough to have his songs still playing.",
      "I asked, \"What's it like for you to hear your music everywhere, even now?\"",
      "\"I don't know the exact right words; I can almost not believe it actually happened, or that that was me,\" he said. \"It's a prideful thing. I think it makes you feel really happy that you are able to tune into the radio station that God delivers, you know, and receive a song like 'Proud Mary,' and write it down, and even take credit for it, right? And then have it go around the world like that? It's kind of too much to really be able to grab hold of.\"",

      "\"I told her I didn't want her to have a rule that she's not going to sign onto it,\" Kennedy said when asked whether he told Monarez to accept the recommendations.",
      "At another point in the hearing, Kennedy claimed he asked Monarez to resign \"because I asked her, 'Are you a trustworthy person?' and she said no.\"",
      "In a statement Thursday afternoon, lawyers for Monarez said Kennedy's claims were \"false, and at times, patently ridiculous.\"",

    "story": [
      "More than 1,000 current and former Health and Human Services employees penned an open letter Wednesday calling for HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to either resign or be fired.",
      "The letter \u2014 whose signatories were not publicly named \u2014 was released at a tense time for the health agency. Last week, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Susan Monarez was fired, and several other top CDC officials resigned from their jobs in protest. Staff are also reeling from layoffs, changes to the vaccine approval system \u2014 led by Kennedy, a longtime vaccine skeptic \u2014 and a shooting outside the CDC headquarters last month.",
      "Wednesday's letter accused Kennedy of \"endangering the nation's health.\" It cited last week's upheaval at the CDC, the Food and Drug Administration's decision to rescind emergency approvals that made the COVID-19 vaccines available for young children, and the elevation of \"political ideologues who pose as scientific experts\" to key vaccine approval posts.",
      "It called for Kennedy to resign, and said that if he declines to leave his post voluntarily, President Trump should pick a new HHS secretary.",
      "\"We swore an oath to support and defend the United States Constitution and to serve the American people. Our oath requires us to speak out when the Constitution is violated and the American people are put at risk,\" the letter reads.",
      "The letter was released by a group called Save HHS, which penned a similar open letter last month urging Kennedy to \"stop spreading inaccurate health information.\"",
      "The group said the signatories for Wednesday's letter were provided to members of Congress, but weren't publicly listed due to security and privacy concerns.",
      "HHS Communications Director Andrew Nixon responded to the letter by defending Kennedy's record and arguing he is working to restore trust in a \"broken\" CDC.",
      "\"From his first day in office, he pledged to check his assumptions at the door \u2014 and he asked every HHS colleague to do the same,\" Nixon said. \"That commitment to evidence-based science is why, in just seven months, he and the HHS team have accomplished more than any health secretary in history in the fight to end the chronic disease epidemic and Make America Healthy Again.\"",
      "Separately, nine former CDC directors wrote a New York Times op-ed on Monday that castigated Kennedy for making decisions they said were \"unlike anything we had ever seen at the agency,\" and argued Monarez's firing \"adds considerable fuel to this raging fire.\"",
      "Kennedy is set to testify before the Senate Finance Committee on Thursday morning, where he's likely to face questions about the tumult at HHS.",
      "Last week, the White House confirmed that Monarez was fired. Her lawyers called the firing \"legally deficient\" and said she was \"targeted\" because she \"refused to rubber-stamp unscientific, reckless directives and fire dedicated public health experts.\"",
      "At least four other senior CDC leaders also stepped down last week, in some cases penning resignation letters that decried cuts to the CDC, accused the Trump administration of an \"ongoing weaponizing of public health\" and blasted \"misinformation\" about vaccines.",
      "Republican Sen. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, a physician who chairs the Senate health committee, said the resignations will \"require oversight.\" He also sits on the Senate Finance Committee.",
      "Meanwhile, Kennedy ousted every member of a CDC panel responsible for making vaccine recommendations earlier this year, in some cases replacing them with people who have questioned the safety of vaccines.",

      "Today, the urgent search for meaningful insights into chronic pain has given that idea a new relevance, with impressive results. Health care providers now encourage patients to engage as partners in the treatment process. Research programs now routinely include people with lived experience\u2014patients, family members, caregivers\u2014as members of committees that advise and direct pain studies.",
      "Pain scientists are calling for a dramatic change that puts greater emphasis on the studies that draw first from people's real-life pain experience, then follows up with lab-based research to develop targeted solutions for effective pain management. This reverse translational research flips the classic bench-to-bedside process that starts in a laboratory and ends with a clinical trial.",
      "Reverse translational research begins with the patient's real-world experience and then tries to decipher the mechanisms through brain imaging and blood tests, correlated with the patient's symptoms and self-reports. Instead of the bench to the bedside, which was taught when I was in medical school, this is bedside to the bench research. The bench scientists then work with the findings to learn more about the basic mechanisms.",
      "Prasad Shirvalkar, a pain physician, neuroscientist, and the director of the Shirvalkar Lab at the University of California at San Francisco, used such a hybrid approach a couple of years ago to find the unicorn in pain science: objective biomarkers of a subjective experience. He started by implanting electrodes in the brains of patients, to measure brain signals. He then followed the trial participants home and, with the use of continuous surveys and digital monitoring, tracked their pain through everyday life and correlated those results with direct readings from the brain. The combination of lab-based and home-based monitoring led to a groundbreaking series of clinical trials that made headlines around the world. In 2023, his team was able to directly map signals of chronic pain for the first time in history. In more recent trials, the team used electrodes implanted in the brain to map the unique neural signature of each participant's pain experience over thousands of hours. The result was the ability, for the first time, to create an objective measure of an individual patient's subjective pain experiences.",
      "In a more recent and ongoing trial, the maps and electrodes were used to predict a pain burst, which was followed by the delivery of a carefully calibrated electrical impulse\u2014deep brain stimulation (DBS) to interrupt the pain, reducing or even eliminating it altogether. Predicting when pain might occur, objectively measuring its severity, and then quickly inhibiting it is in many ways the ultimate achievement.",
      "Ed Mowery's story is about someone using this remarkable treatment approach, but first a caveat. It's not currently available, or even feasible, for general use, so it can't deliver on the dream of a cure for chronic pain. But it does deliver evidence that pain circuitry in the brain is measurable and malleable. It can be targeted and treated, and we'll likely see the emergence of a range of approaches that can do so without brain surgery.",

      "Ed Mowery, the founder and lead singer of a death metal band, suffered unfathomable pain for decades: \"It was 24/7, 365,\" he said, likening it to \"lightning bolt razor snakes in my legs and nerve pain in my arms.",
      "\"Have you ever had a really bad burn when you're cooking? Imagine that really bad burn, multiply it by, say, 20 to 30, and then apply it from the neck down. And on top of that burn was the lightning bolt razor snakes in my legs and the crazy nerve burn in my arms. So, it was several different kinds of pain at once.\"",
      "It's a rare condition affecting 200,000 people in the U.S., called complex regional pain syndrome, or CRPS. But doctors could find no cause for it.",
      "\"There was nothing to point to and says, 'This is why it's hurting.' It was just a sort of unrelenting pain,\" said Dr. Sanjay Gupta, best known as chief medical correspondent at CNN. A neurosurgeon and author, his latest book, \"It Doesn't Have to Hurt,\" explores the mystery of pain \u2013 mundane aches and pains, or excruciating pain like Mowery suffered.",
      "A lot of Americans are hurting; the CDC says approximately 20% are in pain. And while writing the book, Gupta found one of them was his mother \u2013 83-year-old Damyanti Gupta, who had a fall right outside her front door.",
      "\"I had osteoporosis,\" she said, \"and I think one of my bones must have given up, I think, because I didn't trip over anything.\"",
      "Imaging showed a compressed lumbar vertebra. But pain doesn't appear on X-rays and MRIs.\u00a0 \"You know how they ask you, doctors tell me, 'From a scale of one to 10, what is your pain?' I would've said 100,\" Damyanti said. \"You don't really realize 'til you have it. I never realized that pain can be that terrible. You don't want to even live anymore.\"",
      "\"I don't want to live anymore \u2013 coming from my mom, obviously it's really painful to hear,\" said Dr. Gupta. \"But also this was someone who'd never complained about anything. So, you had a sense of just how significant an impact this was on her.\"",
      "Spinal surgery successfully repaired the injured spine, and immediately Damyanti's pain went from 100 to about 3.",
      "The surprising source of pain",
      "As a brain surgeon, Gupta sees patients in pain every day, but he personally experienced serious pain when he was a kid who thought he could vault over a spiked fence. \"I don't know what I was thinking,\" he said. \"But I didn't make it. And this spike from the fence went right through the back of my skin on the side, and came right out the front. So, I was essentially pinned and impaled on top of this fence.\"",
      "As the shock wore off, the future doctor \u2013 still on the fence \u2013 took note: \"The pain started to come in waves. So it was there, felt like someone was sort of slapping my back, but then after a while it just didn't hurt that much anymore. And there was a couple of times when I had to reach back around and say, 'It's still there, right?' Even at the time, that struck me as a really surprising experience. Like, I had a hot poker thing going through my back, and yet I'm not feeling pain? Like, why would that be?\"",
      "Later, he learned the reason why. \"It took years to sort of understand this,\" he said. \"My body's endogenous opioid system \u2013 we have our own opioid system \u2013 it reacted, and it reacted in a big, big way. Because the body is just flooded with all these opioids and it improves my mood, it decreases my memory of the painful experience, and obviously it helps with the overall hurt.",
      "\"These are endorphins, and by the way, endorphins \u2013 endo, which means comes from your body, and phin, morphine\u2014so it's like your body's own natural morphine,\" he said.",
      "After years of suffering despite pain medication (including morphine), Ed Mowery joined a clinical trial at the University of California at San Francisco, which not only found the source of those \"lightning bolt razor snakes,\" but would make headlines around the world.",

      "The source of the pain, said Gupta, was \"the brain. It's hard to conceptualize, I realize this. But Ed is sort of this daredevil guy. He had a lot of injuries over his life. He had had a knee operation, and it was after that knee operation that, for some reason, his brain had taken the experience of his knee surgery and started to memorize it, and got it a little bit wrong. So instead of saying, 'Hey, your knee hurts,' it just went into this hyper-drive. The best metaphor would be something known as 'phantom pain.' That's when someone loses a limb and then they still hurt, even though that limb doesn't even exist anymore. How can that happen? The brain. The brain is creating that pain. Why that's happening exactly, we're not sure.\"",
      "\"Shutting off\" the pain",
      "Mowery had volunteered for a study in deep brain stimulation and pain, and three rounds of brain surgery. \"I had nodes sticking out of my head,\" Mowery said. \"And I had 144 wires going to two computers. And I had a turban on my head. And I also had a lot more hair!\"",
      "Gupta said, \"After weeks they were able to draw this link between Ed's pain and these changes in the brain. And what they found with Ed was not only could they start to predict that Ed was gonna have pain, they could quantify how bad that pain was likely to be, and they could even interrupt the pain by giving a little stimulation. So even before the pain would get to conscious awareness, the stimulator would go off and it would start to interrupt that pain cycle.\"",
      "Gupta predicts Mowery's story is just the beginning: \"What these doctors were able to do, they were essentially able to put these probes all over the brain and just leave these probes in sort of to listen to Ed's brain.\"",
      "Even now, a computer can recognize his pain coming on \u2013 and shut it off.",
      "It's been life-changing for Mowery, who spoke about the clinical trial at the National Institutes of Health: \"The last two days of testing, the signal started working, and killing my pain,\" he said. \"I was beside myself.\"",
      "Though a small study, the implications for managing all sorts of pain are far-reaching. \u00a0As Gupta explains, the brain is the source of every sensation of pain, from a paper cut, to a broken vertebra, to \"razor snakes.\"",
      "I asked Mowery, \"Did you know when you signed up for this, what you were signing up for?\"",
      "\"It's funny you ask that question, because when I first found out, I said, 'There's no way. I'm not doing three brain surgeries. You're not going into my brain. No way,\" Mowery said. \"And then a year-and-a-half later, I was in so much pain, I just didn't care anymore.\"",
      "\"You seem very comfortable when you describe this as your brain,\" I said.",
      "\"It took me a while to wrap my brain around the fact that this is a brain disease,\" Mowery replied. \"It took a long time for me to just say, oh, you know, this is actually all in my head. But it wasn't imaginary. It was real.\"",
      "Today, Mowery is playing his music again, and looking forward to touring internationally with his band. \"I never lost hope,\" he said, \"because I knew something would come along to help me. And I think that's part of what got me through all this, was my attitude towards the whole thing.\"",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/jobs-report-today-august-2025-three-takeways-federal-reserve/",
    "published": "Fri, 05 Sep 2025 21:35:02 -0400",
    "summary": "Employers added far fewer jobs last month than economists had predicted, prompting some experts to reassess the economy.",
    "story": [
      "Many economists say Friday's disappointing jobs report\u00a0is sending warning signals about the pace of hiring across the U.S. and the broader health of the economy.",
      "Employers added only 22,000 nonfarm jobs in August, far short of Wall Street analyst forecasts of 80,000, while the nation's unemployment rate rose to 4.3% \u2014 the highest level since October of 2021, when the economy was still reeling from the effects of the pandemic. In 2024, the economy added an average of 168,000 per month, labor data shows.",
      "The job market is faltering partly because of the Trump administration's tariffs, which are heightening economic uncertainty, boosting costs for importers and complicating business planning.. Some economists also think that rapid employer adoption of artificial intelligence is hurting demand for recent college graduates and other entry-level workers, although there is ongoing debate among researchers about how much AI is affecting job growth.",
      "\"Uncertainty makes it very, very difficult for people in companies to make decisions,\" Laura Ullrich, director of economic research for North America at job-search firm Indeed and a former official at the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"My former boss says that when you are driving through fog, you slow down \u2014 but if it gets thick enough, you pull over.\"",
      "The Trump administration defended its trade and other economic policies, expressing confidence they will eventually drive growth.",
      "\"President Trump's trade deals have unlocked unprecedented market access for American exports to economies that in total are worth over $32 trillion with 1.2 billion people,\" White House spokesman Kush Desai said in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch. \"As these unprecedented trade deals and the administration's pro-growth domestic agenda of deregulation and historic working-class tax cuts take effect, American businesses and families alike have the certainty that the best is yet to come.\"",
      "In response to the jobs report, President Trump on Friday posted on social media that Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell should have moved sooner to cut interest rates. Lower borrowing costs can stimulate job growth by driving consumer spending and making it cheaper for businesses to expand their operations.",
      "\"Jerome 'Too Late' Powell should have lowered rates long ago. As usual, he's 'Too Late!',\" the president wrote.",
      "Here are three key takeaways from economists about the latest employment figures.",
      "The job market is stalling",
      "Overall hiring in August was far weaker than economists expected. More troubling, the numbers look considerably worse after stripping out the two sectors that showed some of the strongest growth in August \u2014 health care and social assistance. Health care companies created 31,000 new jobs last month, while social assistance \u2014 employers such as food banks and those providing services for disabled people, children and low-income families \u2014 added 16,000 new jobs.",
      "But many other sectors had stagnant or even declining job growth, such as manufacturing, which shed 12,000 jobs in August, and professional and business services, which lost 17,000.",
      "\"Absent the secular gains in health care and social assistance, the cyclical categories of the private service sector (excluding health care and social assistance) have collectively turned negative on average in the past four months,\" Nationwide chief economist Kathy Bostjancic said in a report Friday.",
      "Hiring this summer was also weaker than previously thought. The Labor Department's latest\u00a0data\u00a0shows employers cut 13,000 jobs in June, rather than adding 14,000 new hires as the agency had reported in its first estimate for that month. The June drop marks the first decline in monthly jobs since late 2020.",
      "Although July payroll gains were revised up slightly, total job growth for June and July was 21,000 lower than previously reported, according to the Labor Department.",
      "Job growth is at its lowest level in 15 years",
      "The average monthly job gains since January represent the fewest jobs added over the first eight months of the year in 15 years, excluding the pandemic-triggered crisis period of 2020, Indeed's Ullrich noted.",
      "\"We haven't added this few jobs since 2010, and we have 17 million more people in the labor market than we did then,\" she said. \"That, to me, is a staggering headline.\"",
      "That loss of momentum in creating new jobs is raising concerns about the overall strength of the economy. The nation's gross domestic product \u2014 the total value of goods and services \u2014 is expanding\u00a0more slowly than in 2024, while inflation remains above the Federal Reserve's annual growth target of 2%.",
      "That combination has caused some economists to warn about the risk of the U.S. entering a period of\u00a0\"stagflation,\" a toxic mix of high prices and weak growth. Forecasters expect Consumer Price Index data for August, which is set to be released next week, to show inflation rising at an annual rate of 2.9%, according to financial data firm FactSet.",
      "\"Concerns about the health of the economy are starting to creep in,\" Seema Shah, chief global strategist at Principal Asset Management, said in an email. \"Equally, a strong inflation print next week could strike new fears about a stagflationary mix.\"",
      "The Fed is highly likely to cut interest rates this month",
      "Across the board, economists on Friday said the subpar August jobs report virtually locks in a Federal Reserve interest-rate cut when policymakers meet on Sept. 17.\u00a0 The question is by how much.",
      "August hiring was so anemic that some economists now think the Fed could opt for a 0.5 percentage point cut \u2014 double the typical rate cut \u2014 in a bid to keep the job market on track. Traders now see a 10% chance of a jumbo cut and a 90% likelihood of a 0.25 percentage point reduction, according to CME FedWatch. Prior to Friday's jobs report, the market was completely discounting a jumbo cut, the tool shows.",
      "Some economists also think the Fed will continue trimming rates later in 2025 to counter the weak job market.",
      "\"With the weak job growth, the Fed is cleared to cut rates in September. The question is whether we get [0.25 or 0.50 percentage points],\" Scott Helfstein, Global X's head of investment strategy, said in an email. \"We continue to believe the Fed will ease into the cutting cycle here with one rather than two, but there is some latitude here.\"",

    "published": "Fri, 05 Sep 2025 21:33:00 -0400",
    "summary": "The operation targeted one of Georgia's largest and most high-profile manufacturing sites, where Hyundai makes electric vehicles and is building an EV battery plant.",
    "story": [
      "In a large-scale immigration enforcement raid at a huge Hyundai facility in Georgia on Thursday, 475 immigrants suspected of living and working in the U.S. illegally were detained, federal authorities announced.",
      "Steven Schrank, the special agent in charge of Homeland Security Investigations in Georgia and Alabama, told reporters Friday that the majority of those detained were Korean nationals, but he didn't know exactly how many. They worked for a variety of different companies at the site, including subcontractors, he said.",
      "No criminal charges were announced during Friday's news conference. The sweep was conducted as part of a monthslong investigation into allegations of unlawful employment practices and other federal crimes, Schrank said. He described Thursday's raid as the largest enforcement operation at a single site in the history of Homeland Security Investigations, which is a unit of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.",
      "\"This operation underscores our commitment to protecting jobs for Georgians and Americans, ensuring a level playing field for businesses that comply with the law, safeguarding the integrity of our economy and protecting workers from exploitation,\" Schrank said.",
      "Some of those detained Thursday allegedly entered the U.S. illegally, and others were accused of overstaying their visas or violating visa waivers by working, Schrank said. Most of the detainees were taken to an ICE facility in Folkston, Georgia, near the Florida-Georgia state line.",
      "\"They will be moved based on their individual circumstances beyond that,\" Schrank said.",
      "ICE said in a statement Friday night that those arrested during the operation were \"found to be working illegally, in violation of the terms of their visas and/or statuses.\" One green card holder from Mexico was arrested after \"being determined to be removable from the U.S. based on multiple criminal convictions,\" ICE said.",
      "The investigation is ongoing, and additional arrests and charges are possible, ICE said.",
      "In ICE's statement Friday night, Schrank said the operation \"sends a clear message that those who exploit the system and undermine our workforce will be held accountable.\"",
      "\"We welcome all companies who want to invest in the U.S., and if they need to bring workers in for building or other projects, that's fine \u2014 but they need to do it the legal way,\" Schrank said.",
      "The president of Georgia's chapter of the AFL-CIO called the raid politically motivated and said ICE has been escalating its presence at workplaces across the state.",
      "\"This raid is the latest in an ongoing campaign of harassment that has targeted immigrant Georgians as they try to earn an honest living,\" Yvonne Brooks said in a statement. \"Arresting and detaining workers, who are exploited every day and risk their lives every day on the job, creates an atmosphere of fear that terrorizes workers and their families and increases the workload burden on their coworkers.\"",
      "The operation involved law enforcement agents from multiple federal agencies, including ICE, Border Patrol, the FBI, the Drug Enforcement Administration, the IRS and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, underscoring the government-wide nature of the Trump administration's crackdown on illegal immigration.",
      "Earlier, the Atlanta office of the ATF had said 450 people were detained in\u00a0a post on social media, which included pictures from the operation.",
      "The sweep targeted one of Georgia's largest and most high-profile manufacturing sites, touted by Gov. Brian Kemp and other officials as the biggest economic development project in the state's history. Hyundai Motor Group, South Korea's biggest automaker, began manufacturing electric vehicles a year ago at the $7.6 billion plant, which employs about 1,200 people, and has partnered with LG Energy Solution to build an adjacent battery plant, slated to open next year. The search shut down construction on the battery plant.",
      "The Hyundai Motor Company said in a statement that it was aware of the operation and was \"closely monitoring the situation while working to understand the specific circumstances.\"",
      "\"Based on our current understanding, none of those detained is directly employed by Hyundai Motor Company,\" it said. \"Hyundai is committed to full compliance with all laws and regulations in every market where we operate. This includes employment verification requirements and immigration laws. We expect the same commitment from all our partners, suppliers, contractors, and subcontractors.\"",
      "\"We are reviewing our processes to ensure that all parties working on our projects maintain the same high standards of legal compliance that we demand of ourselves. This includes thorough vetting of employment practices by contractors and subcontractors,\" the company said, in part, adding that it will \"conduct an investigation to ensure all suppliers and their subcontractors comply with all laws and regulations.\"",
      "In a statement to The Associated Press, LG said it was \"closely monitoring the situation and gathering all relevant details.\" It said it couldn't immediately confirm how many of its employees or Hyundai workers had been detained.",
      "\"Our top priority is always ensuring the safety and well-being of our employees and partners. We will fully cooperate with the relevant authorities,\" the company said.",
      "ICE spokesman Lindsay Williams confirmed that federal authorities conducted an enforcement operation at the 3,000-acre site west of Savannah. He said agents were focused on the construction site for the battery plant.",
      "The South Korean Foreign Ministry said in a statement that it was dispatching officials to the site and urged the U.S. Embassy in Seoul \"to exercise extreme caution to ensure that the legitimate rights and interests of Korean citizens are not infringed upon.\"",
      "\"The economic activities of Korean investment companies and the rights and interests of Korean citizens must not be unfairly infringed upon during U.S. law enforcement operations,\" the Foreign Ministry said.",
      "Georgia State Patrol troopers blocked roads to the Hyundai site. The Georgia Department of Public Safety confirmed it was dispatched to assist federal authorities.",
      "Video posted to social media on Thursday showed workers in yellow safety vests lined up as a man wearing a face mask and a tactical vest with the letters HSI, which stands for Homeland Security Investigations, tells them: \"We're Homeland Security. We have a search warrant for the whole site.\"",
      "\"We need construction to cease immediately,\" the man says in the video. \"We need all work to end on the site right now.\"",
      "The Trump administration has undertaken sweeping ICE operations as part of a mass deportation agenda. Immigration officers have raided farms, construction sites, restaurants and auto repair shops.",
      "The Pew Research Center, citing preliminary Census Bureau data, says the U.S. labor force lost more than 1.2 million immigrants from January through July. That includes people who are in the country illegally as well as legal residents.",
      "Hyundai and LG's battery joint venture, HL-GA Battery Company, said in a statement that it's \"cooperating fully with the appropriate authorities\" and paused construction of the battery site to assist their work.",
      "Operations at Hyundai's EV manufacturing plant weren't interrupted, said plant spokesperson Bianca Johnson.",

    "story": [
      "Employers across the U.S. added 22,000 jobs in August, falling short of economists' muted expectations and signaling the labor market is facing sharp headwinds from mounting economic uncertainty amid the Trump administration's wide-ranging tariffs.",
      "The numbers",
      "Economists had forecast payroll gains of 80,000 last month, according to a poll by FactSet.",
      "The unemployment rate rose to 4.3% in August, up from 4.2% in July, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said.",
      "The latest data points to an ongoing slowdown in the labor market, with employers hiring an average of 29,000 each month from June through August, versus 168,000 workers each month in 2024. Revised data shows that employers shed 13,000 jobs in June rather than adding the 14,000 that had been reported a month earlier, marking the first decline since late 2020.",
      "Some companies are paring back hiring plans amid the on-again, off-again uncertainty of the Trump administration's tariffs, which are import duties paid by U.S. companies. Businesses in seven of the Fed's 12 regional districts canvassed in the latest so-called Beige Book, a survey of local economic conditions, said they were hesitant to hire because of weaker demand and uncertainty over the near-term outlook.",
      "\"August's employment report confirmed that the labor market has headed off a cliff-edge,\" Bradley Saunders, North America economist at Capital Economics, said in a Friday research report.",
      "Consumers are also dour, with a new CBS News poll finding that Americans are continuing to rate the U.S. economy negatively, with most respondents picking \"uncertain\" and \"struggling\" to describe its current state.",
      "The August jobs report marks the first since President Trump\u00a0fired former Bureau of Labor Statistics Commissioner Erika McEntarfer on Aug. 1 in the wake of a disappointing July jobs report, which included a significant downward revision of May and June hiring figures.",
      "Citing the large revisions, Mr. Trump questioned the validity of the government data, although the BLS typically revises its prior reports each month based on fresher responses from employers.",
      "The new revisions",
      "On Friday, the BLS revised the prior two months' data, showing that employers shed 13,000 jobs in June, revising the month's hiring downward by 27,000 fewer jobs. That marks the first monthly decline in hiring since December 2020, when the U.S. was in the midst of an economic crisis caused by the pandemic.",
      "The BLS also revised July's jobs numbers upward, showing that employers added 79,000 workers that month, rather than the 73,000 reported in August.",
      "The revisions show that the economy added 21,000 fewer jobs in June and July than had earlier been reported by the BLS.",
      "What economists say",
      "The labor market data is complicating the Federal Reserve's next rate cut decision, which set for Sept. 17. The central bank's dual mandate requires it to ensure that both inflation and unemployment remain low, but inflation has been edging upward, which economists say is partly due to Mr. Trump's tariffs.",
      "The Fed's most powerful weapon for battling inflation is to hike interest rates, yet its best option for helping the job market is to lower borrowing costs, making it cheaper for businesses to expand. With the combination of rising inflation and weaker hiring, the Fed is in a tough position, economists say.",
      "Last month, Fed Chair Jerome Powell, who has been under pressure from Mr. Trump to cut rates, signaled that the central bank is open to reducing rates at its September meeting, citing risks to the labor market.",
      "\"The labor market continues to show fatigue as businesses hold back on hiring amid uncertainty around the direction of inflation, tariffs and the strength of the underlying economy,\" said Joe Gaffoglio, CEO at Mutual of America Capital Management, in an email after the data was released.",
      "\"Recent labor data showed that more individuals are unemployed in the U.S. (7.24 million) than there are available jobs (7.18 million), which hasn't happened since April 2021,\" he added.",
      "The latest data is likely to ensure a rate cut at the Fed's next meeting, experts said on Friday. The lower-than-expected hiring, as well as June's negative revision, could also persuade the central bank to cut later in the year as well, they added.",
      "\"The Federal Reserve needs to cut interest rates in September and probably October and December, too. The 'no hiring' economy is turning to a layoff economy and if that worsens, it will lead to a recession. This needs to be stopped,\" Heather Long, chief economist at Navy Federal Credit Union, said in an email.",

      "Massachusetts leads the way in lottery spending, according to a LendingTree\u00a0analysis\u00a0of government data. Residents there shell out an average of $915 a year on tickets they hope will earn them big bucks. Rhode Island residents come in second, spending $573 annually.",
      "North Dakotans are perhaps the most realistic about their chances of winning. They spent just $50 on lottery tickets in 2023, the lowest of any other state.",
      "But that may be because lottery tickets are harder to access there, according to LendingTree's chief consumer finance analyst Matt Schulz, who noted that people in urban areas have more opportunities to purchase lottery tickets than those in rural areas.",
      "\"It's easier to go to a convenience store and pick up a lotto ticket in Massachusetts or New York than it is in North Dakota,\" he told CBS MoneyWatch. \"Some of it might just be about opportunity.\"",
      "Source of revenue",
      "Lottery spending can generate a substantial amount of revenue in participating states. On average it accounts for about 1% of a state's general revenue. That figure rises to 3% in Rhode Island, South Dakota and West Virginia, according to the LendingTree's analysis. In Florida, lottery sales make up 2% of the state's revenue.",
      "\"That shows how significant these programs are for these states,\" Schulz said. \"Imagine if something were to happen and suddenly 3% of a state's revenue just disappeared.\"",
      "While the\u00a0odds of winning are next-to-none, a prize-winning ticket can be life-changing. In 2023, Americans spent an average of $320 on lottery tickets, up about 4% from 2022, according to LendingTree.",

      "With the Powerball jackpot now an estimated $1.8 billion for Saturday night's drawing, there's lottery fever in the air. If you're the lucky one whose $2 ticket ends up worth millions, what do you do with all that money?",
      "Jackpot winners have the option to either take a lump sum payment of the estimated cash value \u2014 in this case, roughly $826.4 million \u2014 or they can opt to receive their prize as an annuity, paid in 30 graduated payments over 29 years. In either case, those totals are before the Internal Revenue Service takes a cut, as do most states.",
      "Should you take a lump sum payment or annuity option?",
      "Dan Geltrude, a certified public accountant in New Jersey, told CBS News: \"I personally would take the lump sum payment because I feel comfortable in how I can invest my money. However, having that much money for a lot of people is dangerous.\"",
      "Saturday's jackpot is now the second-largest in U.S. lottery history, with an estimated cash value of $826.4 million, according to Powerball. The record $2.04 billion grand prize was won on Nov. 7, 2022, in California.",

      "If you opt for the annuity payment, \"it will take you a while to lose all that money, so that's the safe bet,\" Geltrude said.",

    "summary": "Armani never relinquished control over the multibillion-dollar company he created, a key to his enormous success.",
    "story": [
      "Giorgio Armani leaves a legacy not only as a seminal figure in the history of fashion, but also as a visionary business leader who built a globally recognized brand and multibillion-dollar business empire, industry experts said after his death Thursday at age 91.",
      "\"Armani made certain that his vision was consistent and that it was always classy, even down to presentation in the Armani Exchange stores,\" Shawn Grain Carter, an associate professor at the Fashion Institute of Technology, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Armani, or \"Re Giorgio\" (King George) as the Italians call him, famously created luxury looks for Hollywood stars, while also producing stylish accessories and clothing for everyday consumers.",
      "While meticulously tailored clothing made from quality fabrics has always been at the heart of the Armani brand, the designer expanded his business over the years to include not just perfumes and accessories but home furnishings, cosmetics, books, flowers \u2014 even chocolates. Connecting them all was sophisticated design, which Armani wove into all things he put his name on.",
      "\"He was masterful in sticking to his vision, but executing it in a way that would be accessible luxury, a quiet luxury, but still tasteful and elegantly crafted,\" Grain Carter said.",
      "Among Armani's most celebrated contributions and successful business maneuvers was the power suit, a softly tailored, ready-to-wear take on office attire that quickly rose in popularity among the American business class.",
      "Introduced in the '70s, the Armani suit was a bold deviation from the rigid, restrictive suits businessmen were accustomed to wearing. Armani's elegantly tailored suits quickly became a must in every well-heeled man's closet.",
      "Beth Dincuff, an associate professor at New York's Parsons School of Design, said Armani cultivated the idea of a \"sophisticated man who cared about how he looked, who was aware of his physique and who wanted to show it off in a new way.\"",
      "Armani soon brought that masculine sensibility to women's fashion with the pantsuit, a shoulder-padded jacket and tailored trousers. This gave women a refined option for the office that projected confidence and power.",
      "\"That's attributed to Giorgio Armani \u2014 making it OK for a woman to wear a pantsuit but still look like a woman in terms of a power aesthetic,\" said Grain Carter.",
      "Armani's designs also had a knack for tapping into the zeitgeist. He\u00a0told CBS News in 2006 that his new line of women's clothes was in response to the feminist movement. Women needed their own version of the traditional men's suit jacket, Armani thought.",
      "Celebrities and Armani",
      "Using celebrities to elevate the Armani brand was another to key to the designer's business success. He began by outfitting Richard Gere in the 1980 neo-noir crime drama \"American Gigolo.\" Armani went on to design clothes for more than 150 films throughout his career.",
      "\"His idea to reach out to celebrities was very, very important,\" said Dincuff, noting that this approach to marketing fashion was novel at the time.",
      "Armani pivoted to dressing celebrities on the red carpet in the 1990s, where his\u00a0black-tie outfits and glittering evening gowns often stole the show. Some early looks that captured popular attention included the oversized Armani suit worn by Julia Roberts at the 1990s Golden Globes and a champagne-colored Armani suit that Jodie Foster wore at the 1992 Academy Awards.",
      "The list of celebrities that have\u00a0worn Armani on the red carpet is long and includes Beyonc\u00e9, Selena Gomez, \u00a0Anne Hathaway, Michelle Pfeiffer, Margot Robbie and Winona Ryder.",
      "His own boss",
      "Central to Armani's success was the fact that he never relinquished control of the multibillion company he created, experts told CBS MoneyWatch. In rejecting a merger or sale to a larger industry rival, the Italian fashion designer was always his own boss.",
      "This allowed Armani to maintain creative control and consistency over his expanding business empire, distinguishing him from other designers.",
      "While he did strike several licensing deals over his career with companies like EssilorLuxottica\u00a0and\u00a0L'Or\u00e9al, he kept the majority of his business portfolio in-house. That included everything from Armani Priv\u00e9, his haute couture fashion collection and fragrance line, to Armani Exchange \u2014 a more affordable fashion line geared toward younger generations, said Grain Carter. Armani also kept the collections Giorgio Armani and Emporio Armani under his purview.",
      "\"All of this was in-house and he controlled it from concept to production to distribution to marketing to how it is financed,\" Grain Carter said. \"He was active at every level, at every step.\"",
      "Today, the Armani empire has more than 9,000 employees along with seven industrial hubs and over 600 stores worldwide, according to figures released in 2023.",
      "As for potential succession plans, the Giorgio Armani company did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "\"I cannot really contemplate the next person, because there will be no other Giorgio Armani,\" Grain Carter said.",

      "The company has agreed to pay authors about $3,000 for each of an estimated 500,000 books covered by the settlement. A trio of authors \u2014 thriller novelist Andrea Bartz and nonfiction writers Charles Graeber and Kirk Wallace Johnson \u2014 sued last year, and now represent a broader group of writers and publishers whose books Anthropic downloaded to train its chatbot Claude.",
      "The landmark settlement could mark a turning point in legal battles between AI companies and the writers, visual artists and other creative professionals who accuse them of copyright infringement. A judge could approve the settlement as soon as Monday.",
      "\"As best as we can tell, it's the largest copyright recovery ever,\" said Justin Nelson, a lawyer for the authors. \"It is the first of its kind in the AI era.\"",
      "In a statement to CBS News, Anthropic Aparna Sridhar deputy general counsel said the settlement \"will resolve the plaintiffs' remaining legacy claims.\"",
      "Sridhar added that the settlement comes after the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California in June ruled that Anthropic's use of legally purchased books to train Claude did not violate U.S. copyright law.",
      "\"We remain committed to developing safe AI systems that help people and organizations extend their capabilities, advance scientific discovery and solve complex problems,\" Sridhar said.",
      "Anthropic, which was founded by former executives with ChatGPT developer OpenAI,\u00a0introduced\u00a0Claude in 2023. Like other generative AI bots, the tool lets users ask natural language questions and then provides summarized answers using AI trained on millions of books, articles and other material.",
      "Settlement terms",
      "If Anthropic had not settled, experts say losing the case after a scheduled December trial could have cost the San Francisco-based company even more money.",
      "\"We were looking at a strong possibility of multiple billions of dollars, enough to potentially cripple or even put Anthropic out of business,\" said William Long, a legal analyst for Wolters Kluwer.",
      "U.S. District Judge William Alsup of San Francisco has scheduled a Monday hearing to review the settlement terms.",
      "Books are known to be important sources of data \u2014 in essence, billions of words carefully strung together \u2014 that are needed to build the AI large language models behind chatbots like Anthropic's Claude and its chief rival, OpenAI's ChatGPT.",
      "Alsup's June ruling found that Anthropic had downloaded more than 7 million digitized books that it \"knew had been pirated.\" It started with nearly 200,000 from an online library called Books3, assembled by AI researchers outside of OpenAI to match the vast collections on which ChatGPT was trained.",
      "Debut thriller novel \"The Lost Night\" by Bartz, a lead plaintiff in the case, was among those found in the Books3 dataset.",
      "Anthropic later took at least 5 million copies from the pirate website Library Genesis, or LibGen, and at least 2 million copies from the Pirate Library Mirror, Alsup wrote.",
      "The Authors Guild told its thousands of members last month that it expected \"damages will be minimally $750 per work and could be much higher\" if Anthropic was found at trial to have willfully infringed their copyrights. The settlement's higher award \u2014 approximately $3,000 per work \u2014 likely reflects a smaller pool of affected books, after taking out duplicates and those without copyright.",
      "On Friday, Mary Rasenberger, CEO of the Authors Guild, called the settlement \"an excellent result for authors, publishers, and rightsholders generally, sending a strong message to the AI industry that there are serious consequences when they pirate authors' works to train their AI, robbing those least able to afford it.\"",

Some of the rules proposed or adopted by the previous administration, however, went beyond what Congress has required by statute, and we intend to reconsider those extra-statutory requirements.\"",
      "\"This action does not change the Department's commitment or intent to carry out the consumer protection mandates from Congress in the recent FAA Reauthorization Act, including provisions relating to refunds.

      "At the time McCormick also rejected an equally unprecedented and massive\u00a0fee request by plaintiff attorneys, who argued that they were entitled to legal fees in the form of Tesla stock valued at more than $5 billion. The judge said the attorneys were entitled to a fee award of $345 million.",
      "According to the regulatory filing, if the Delaware courts reinstate Musk's 2018 pay package, the $29 billion award would be \"immediately forfeited and returned to the Company.\"",

      "In its most recent quarter, Tesla reported that quarterly profits plunged from $1.39 billion to $409 million. Revenue also plummeted and the company fell short of even lowered expectations on Wall Street.",
      "Under pressure from shareholders last month, Tesla scheduled an annual shareholders meeting for November to comply with Texas state law.",
      "A group of more than 20 Tesla shareholders, which have watched Tesla shares plummet, said in a letter to the company that it needed to at least provide public notice of the annual meeting.",

That means the total damages awarded in the five-year-old case works out to about $4 per device.",
      "Google had denied that it was improperly tracking the online activity of people who thought they had shielded themselves with privacy controls. The company maintained its stance even though the eight-person jury concluded Google had been spying in violation of California privacy laws.",
      "\"This decision misunderstands how our products work, and we will appeal it,\" Google spokesman Jose Castaneda said Thursday. \"Our privacy tools give people control over their data, and when they turn off personalization, we honor that choice.\"",
      "The lawyers who filed the case had argued Google had used the data they collected off smartphones without users' permission to help sell ads tailored to users' individual interests \u2014 a strategy that resulted in the company reaping billions in additional revenue. The lawyers framed those ad sales as illegal profiteering that merited damages of more than $30 billion.",
      "Even though the jury came up with a far lower calculation for the damages, one of the lawyers who brought the case against Google hailed the outcome as a victory for privacy protection.",
      "\"We hope this result sends a message to the tech industry that Americans will not sit idly by as their information is collected and monetized against their will,\" said attorney John Yanchunis of law firm Morgan & Morgan.",
      "The San Francisco jury verdict came a day after Google avoided the U.S. Department of Justice's attempt to break up the company in a landmark antitrust case in Washington, D.C., targeting its dominant search engine. A federal judge who had declared Google's search engine to be an illegal monopoly ordered less radical changes, including requiring the company to share some of its search data with rivals.",

      "American businesses could be owed tens of billions of dollars in refunds for tariffs they paid on foreign goods.",
      "U.S. Customs and Border Protection has collected more than $200 billion in tariff revenue from American businesses of all sizes from October through August 24, according to agency data. Of that, more than $70 billion comes from payments of country-based tariffs that\u00a0a federal appeals court recently ruled\u00a0President Trump lacked the authority to impose.",
      "Industry-specific tariffs, such as steel and aluminum levies, are unaffected by Friday's ruling.",
      "The court on Friday ruled that President Trump unlawfully invoked the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, or IEEPA, to impose sweeping tariffs of up to 145% on dozens of U.S. trade partners. Mr. Trump on Wednesday asked the Supreme Court to review the federal appeals court's decision before it takes effect on Oct. 14.",
      "Mr. Trump's appeal means that, for now, there's no guarantee businesses will receive refunds. That spells more uncertainty for enterprises struggling to balance raising prices to cover the cost of levies against potentially turning away customers, according to supply chain experts.",
      "\"From the supply chain perspective, we are seeing a lot of uncertainty, which has been the case since April 2,\" Scott Pruneau, CEO of ITS Logistics, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"No one knows how to price their goods, because you can't whipsaw your customers on pricing.\"",
      "If the court's decision stands, the U.S. government could have to return billions in tariff revenue it has collected from businesses.",
      "\"It'd be very challenging\"",
      "But even if the Supreme Court strikes down the tariffs, businesses could still face hurdles in collecting refunds for the levies they've already paid the U.S. government, experts told CBS MoneyWatch. For one, there is no guarantee that whatever kind of refund system the government sets up would be automatic or that the process will be simple.",
      "\"There's been speculation that if ultimately, the Supreme Court overturns the tariffs, then Customs could just issue refunds, but I don't know that it's going to happen that way,\" Felicia Pullam, former executive director of the Office of Trade Relations at U.S. Customs and Border Protection, and the current senior director for geo-commerce at APCO, a global advisory firm, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"The easiest way would be for Customs to put a process in place and issue refunds, rather than make companies go and apply,\" she added.",
      "Ultimately, however, if refunds are owed, it would be up to the Trump administration to decide how to administer them. \"It'd be very challenging, but I am confident CBP could handle it.\"",
      "U.S. Customs and Border Protection didn't immediately reply to a request for comment.",
      "Requests for refunds",
      "Ted Murphy, co-leader of Sidley Austin's global arbitration, trade and advocacy practice, told CBS MoneyWatch that if the Supreme Court affirms the federal circuit court's ruling that Trump's reliance on IEEPA to impose country-based tariffs was illegal, the government would have to cease collecting tariffs from companies.",
      "When it comes to recouping levies that have already been paid, there are three ways refunds could be administered, Murphy said.",
      "Most simply, the government could provide automatic refunds to businesses for levy amounts paid. \"The government has that information, so it could happen automatically,\" Murphy told CBS MoneyWatch. \"I don't think that's particularly likely, but it is an option.\"",
      "The government could instead decide that only the plaintiffs who filed suit against the tariffs are entitled to refunds, and require additional parties seeking refunds to bring similar legal actions. \"In that case, you'd see tens and tens of thousands of people filing complaints at the Court of International Trade,\" he said.",
      "But the most likely repayment option in Murphy's view would be that the government agrees to refund duties paid by parties who submit requests for reimbursement.",
      "Historical precedent for refunds",
      "There's precedent for the government reimbursing businesses for tariff payments that were later deemed unlawful. In 1998, the Supreme Court struck down a harbor maintenance tax assessed on exports, which had been imposed by the Reagan administration. The government then owed companies more than a billion dollars in refunds, which it required companies to apply for in order to receive.",
      "Dan Anthony, president of Trade Partnership Worldwide, a trade consultancy, echoed Murphy, saying that it is hard to predict how the government might choose to process refunds, should the Supreme Court determine they are owed.",
      "\"It's up to the administration to decide, and that's where it gets very complicated and speculative,\" he told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Technically speaking, issuing refunds wouldn't be hard. \"Theoretically, the government could quite quickly figure out who paid what, and refund it to the payer,\" he said. \"But the government could also make it very difficult and force people to make requests.\"",
      "That would create work for companies, but also for the government, which would then have to review requests for refunds from thousands of companies. \"That's infinitely more work for the government, but it's pretty clear the government does not want to give money back, so if you make it a difficult process, then a number of importers are probably not going to pursue it,\" Anthony said.",
      "Large refunds to businesses could weigh on the Treasury's finances, TD Securities analysts noted in a report Thursday. \"Treasury would likely step up bill supply even further to obtain the extra funds, creating little disruption in longer-dated yields, but potentially pressuring funding spreads,\" TD Securities analysts said.",
      "The Trump administration could also turn to other emergency powers to replace the IEEPA tariffs in order to maintain the U.S.' effective tariff rate, the analysts noted.",
      "Neither the White House nor the Treasury immediately responded to a request for comment.",

      "The news comes at a financially tumultuous time for the budget carrier. Spirit initially filed for bankruptcy protection in November 2024 after years of of struggling with rising operation costs and mounting debt. Just months after emerging from Chapter 11 reorganization, the airline filed for bankruptcy protection again in August.",
      "At the time, Spirit said it intended to conduct business as usual during the restructuring process, signaling passengers would still be able to book flights and use tickets.",
      "Spirit is seeking to cut costs by eliminating money-losing routes.

      "This year's pass offers the most amount of travel time that Frontier has offered through the program, Frontier Airlines chief commercial officer Bobby Schroeter said in a statement Tuesday.",
      "It's a step that could help Frontier catapult past its competitors, industry experts said.

    "published": "Thu, 04 Sep 2025 09:41:14 -0400",
    "summary": "After President Trump expressed \"shock\" over the pace of hiring in July, much is riding on the employment data for August.",
    "story": [
      "When President Trump last month fired the head of the federal bureau that produces the government's monthly jobs report after the numbers pointed to a slump in U.S. hiring, he drew rebukes from critics who accused him of politicizing a technical \u2014 and nonpartisan \u2014 data collection process.",
      "On Friday, the Labor Department is set to release employment figures for August in what could emerge as another possible flashpoint.",
      "The new payroll report comes at a critical juncture for the economy. Recent data suggests the labor market is cooling, a particular concern as workers and businesses head into the crucial\u00a0holiday spending period. The Federal Reserve later this month is also expected to cut its benchmark interest rate for the first time since December 2024 as it swivels from fighting inflation to shoring up job growth.",
      "The August employment report will be the first since Mr. Trump ordered the dismissal of former Bureau of Labor Statistics Commissioner Erika McEntarfer and questioned the Labor Department's competence in tracking the rate of job-creation across the U.S.",
      "In the aftermath, economists expressed concern that Mr. Trump's move could undermine confidence in the accuracy of U.S. economic data \u2014 a benchmark for the global economy. Any further actions by the Trump administration to question the accuracy of the monthly jobs data could sow further doubt about its validity, Gregory Daco, chief economist at strategy consulting firm EY-Parthenon, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "What happened last month",
      "Employers added only 73,000 jobs in July, the government reported last month \u2014 a figure that fell far short of economist forecasts and that led Mr. Trump to express \"shock\"\u00a0over what appeared to be a sudden downturn in hiring. Also troubling was that the Labor Department sharply revised down how many jobs the economy added in May and June, a sign the economy was weaker than previously thought.",
      "Such revisions are common, according to economists. The U.S. has roughly 160 million workers, making it impossible for the Bureau of Labor Statistics to tally each job every month. Instead, Labor Department staff draws on available data to estimate hiring and layoffs, while also revising their estimates for seasonal factors.",
      "Still, the Labor Department's July recalculation of the pace of job growth was noteworthy for its scale, representing the largest two-month downward revision since 1968.",
      "\"The previous report was obviously shocking in the sense of the downward revisions for the previous two months, and really caused a reckoning in the sense of needing to view hiring in a new light \u2014 and obviously not in a positive light,\" Mark Hamrick, senior economic analyst at Bankrate, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Indeed, the disappointing numbers were the clearest sign to date this year that the job market could be starting to sputter as the impact of the Trump administration's tariffs and general economic uncertainty weigh on employers.",
      "What to expect from the August job numbers \u2014 and beyond",
      "The August jobs data will provide a crucial measure of whether the labor market is holding up or running out of steam, as recent data suggests. The year started off strong, with an average monthly payroll gain of 123,000 from January to April \u2014 well above the number required to keep the nation's unemployment rate, now at 4.2%, from rising.",
      "However, the job market has stalled in recent months, with an average payroll gain from May to July of only 35,000. For the first time since April of 2021, the U.S. now has more unemployed people, at 7.24 million, than the 7.18 million jobs open around the country, according to labor data released on Wednesday.",
      "\"This is yet another data point underscoring how this job market is frozen, and it's difficult for anyone to get a job right now,\" Heather Long, chief economist at Navy Federal Credit Union, said in an email. \"This is a turning point for the labor market. It's yet another crack.\"",
      "Economists polled by financial data firm FactSet projected that employers added 80,000 jobs in August, with the unemployment rate expected to hold steady at 4.2%. A figure around or exceeding that level would alleviate fears that the job market is cratering.",
      "Daco, who forecasts a much more moderate gain of 40,000 jobs in August, said in a research note this week that the employment report on Friday is \"likely to confirm that a marked slowdown in labor market conditions is underway.\"",
      "Another important marker to look for in the latest job figures will be whether the Labor Department revises the payroll gains for July, as it did for May and June.",
      "\"Since every month in 2025 has been revised lower so far, the risk is that July job growth will also be marked down,\" Shruti Mishra, a U.S. economist at Bank of America Global Research, said in a report. \"This could point to more sustained labor market weakness than we have been forecasting.\"",
      "Moving forward, Daco predicts payroll gains will average around 30,000 per month through the end of the year and for the nation's jobless rate to reach 4.7% by December.",
      "\"Looking ahead, the labor market slowdown is likely to persist,\" he said.",
      "What could the jobs report mean for a Fed rate cut?",
      "The Federal Reserve has held off on lowering interest rates as it tries to finish the job of extinguishing the raging inflation that scorched consumers during the pandemic and to assess the impact of steeper tariffs on the economy.",
      "Fed Chair Jerome Powell signaled last month that there might be an opening for a cut in September as downside risks to employment increase. Another month of weak or flat job growth would reinforce this outlook and likely keep the central bank on track for a cut at the Fed's next policy meeting on Sept. 16-17, according to many economists.",
      "\"The report would have to be significantly stronger than we are forecasting to dissuade the [Fed] from cutting rates,\" Oxford Economics said in a recent report.",

      "The generation expected to tighten their spending the most is Gen Z. Respondents from this cohort, ages 17 to 28, said they expect to reduce their holiday budgets by 23% \u2014 more than any other generation in the study. That's due in part to the\u00a0tough job market\u00a0facing young Americans, along with rising costs.",
      "Overall, 84% of consumers expect to cut back spending in general over the next six months, according to the report.",
      "A slowdown in spending could spell trouble for retailers who depend on holiday sales to shore up revenue toward the end of the year. Since 2019, holiday sales during the months of November and December have accounted for 19% of total retail revenue for the year, according to a National Retail Federation\u00a0report.",
      "Tariffs, high prices top of mind",
      "The projected pullback in consumer holiday spending underscores Americans' shaky confidence in the state of the economy. Worries over inflation and tariffs have already led shoppers to be more judicious with their spending.",
      "Discretionary spending on categories like indoor and outdoor dining were down in August, according to the U.S. Conference Board's latest consumer confidence index each month. Meanwhile, average 12-month inflation expectations among consumers increased to 6.2%, from 5.7% in July.",
      "Tighter spending",
      "PwC expects consumers to approach holiday shopping \"more deliberately,\" with an eye toward saving money, amid ongoing concerns over tariffs and high prices.",
      "Furman said the potential for tariff-related price increases has already made the consumers \"very conscious of trying to buy things at a discount.\"Case in point: Internet searches for \"discount\" and \"coupon code\" have climbed by 11% over the past year, according to the survey.",
      "With deals in mind, consumers are expected to do a large portion, or 39%, of their total planned holiday gift spending, during the time between Thanksgiving and Cyber Monday, according to the PwC report. With heightened traffic expected during that five-day stretch, Furman advises shoppers to start looking early for popular items.",
      "\"If you're interested in very hot items, knowing that they're going to likely be on shelves sooner, to guarantee that you'll get them, you may want to shop for them in those early promotional cycles, versus wait until the five-day frenzy,\" she said.",

    "published": "Wed, 03 Sep 2025 11:04:07 -0400",
    "summary": "Wasted energy is a hidden drain on household electricity but small steps can contribute significantly to lowering costs and emissions.",
    "story": [
      "The lights are off, the house is quiet and nothing seems to be running. But electricity is silently flowing through the plugs in your home. This hidden drain is known as phantom energy.",
      "Also called vampire energy, the wasted electricity comes from leaving devices plugged in when they're not in use. That could range from household items such as phone chargers and microwaves to TVs and gaming consoles.",
      "This wasted electricity accounts for about 5% to 10% of home energy use, depending on factors like the age of the equipment, according to Alexis Abramson, dean of the Columbia Climate School.",
      "\"Phantom energy depends on ... what kind of systems you have and how much they've improved over time,\" said Abramson.",
      "For example, televisions that are connected to the internet and have smart wake features that allow them to interact with phones and other devices can consume up to 40 watts of energy during the hours of the day that the TV would normally be off, according to Matt Malinowski, director of the buildings program at the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy. That's almost 40 times as much as a regular television.",
      "\"The good news is there have been new, renewed efforts to tackle this,\" said Malinowski.",
      "He said advocates and manufacturers have come up with a voluntary agreement seeking to reduce the amount of energy smart televisions use when they're in standby mode.",
      "Phantom energy contributes to climate change because power drawn by unused devices can increase demand for electricity from sources that release planet-warming emissions. Aidan Charron, associate director of Global Earth Day, said that while the amount may seem small when a person looks at their individual utility bill, the environmental toll of phantom energy is significant when multiplied over homes across the country.",
      "\"Just take a little step of unplugging the things that you're not using,\" said Charron. \"It will save you money and it'll save emissions in the long run.\"",
      "Some of the main culprits when it comes to draining energy are appliances that are constantly connected to electricity, such as those with a clock.",
      "\"Do you really need your microwave to tell you the time, or can you unplug your microwave when you're not using it?\" said Charron.",
      "While unplugging devices may seem burdensome, it significantly contributes to reducing emissions.",
      "Charron recommends starting with small steps like unplugging chargers for phones and other devices once the battery is fully charged. The next step is moving to other appliances such as unplugging an unused lamp.",
      "If unplugging sounds too hard, regularly checking your settings and disabling any extra feature you're not using that could be draining energy help, too. For example, smart televisions often have optional features that can be turned off so the television isn't listening for signals from other devices while in standby mode.",
      "\"If you're not using it, then you're getting no benefit, yet you're paying the price and increased the energy use,\" said Malinowski.",
      "Individuals also tend to take more sustainable actions, such as unplugging devices, once they learn what they can do to decrease their household emissions efficiently. Those actions could contribute to reducing U.S. emissions by about 20% per year, which equals about 450 tons (408 metric tons) of carbon dioxide, according to Jonathan Gilligan, a professor of earth and environmental science at Vanderbilt University.",
      "The choices individuals take in their daily lives all add up, Gilligan said, mainly because of how much the U.S. population contributes to direct greenhouse gas emissions.",
      "\"The question becomes, what can we do to try to address this?\" said Gilligan. \"Phantom power is one part of this.\"",
      "The more individuals decrease their footprint, the more likely it is that others will follow, too, and eventually, those actions may turn to societal norms, according to Gilligan, because individuals don't want to feel like they're being irresponsible.",
      "\"This is a place where psychologists find that this effect is real. If people see that other people are doing actions to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions, they want to do that\" said Giligan.",
      "When it comes to daily choices, individuals may think what they're doing isn't really making a big difference. But what they tend to overlook is how they influence others around them by choosing to live a more sustainable life.",
      "The impact may be much stronger than a lot of people realize, Gilligan said.",

    "summary": "The judge rejected the Justice Department's effort to force Google to sell its popular Chrome browser, concluding the request was a bridge too far.",
    "story": [
      "A federal judge on Tuesday ordered a shake-up of Google's search engine in a crackdown aimed at curbing the corrosive power of an illegal monopoly while rebuffing the U.S. government's attempt to break up the company and impose other restraints.",
      "The 226-page decision made by U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta in Washington, D.C., will likely ripple across the technological landscape at a time when the industry is being reshaped by breakthroughs in artificial intelligence \u2014 including conversational \"answer engines\" as companies like ChatGPT and Perplexity try to upend Google's long-held position as the internet's main gateway.",
      "The innovations and competition being unleashed by generative artificial intelligence, or \"GenAI,\" have reshaped the judge's approach to remedies in the nearly five-year-old antitrust case.",
      "\"Unlike the typical case where the court's job is to resolve a dispute based on historic facts, here the court is asked to gaze into a crystal ball and look to the future. Not exactly a judge's forte,\" Mehta wrote.",
      "Investors seemed to interpret the ruling as a relatively light slap on the wrist for Google, as the stock price of its corporate parent, Alphabet Inc., surged nearly 3% in extended trading.",
      "The judge is trying to rein in Google by prohibiting some of the tactics the company deployed to drive traffic to its search engine and other services.",
      "But Mehta stopped short of banning the multi-billion dollar deals that Google has been making for years to lock in its search engine as the default on smartphones, personal computers and other devices. Those deals, involving payments of more than $26 billion annually, were one of the main issues that prompted the judge to conclude Google's search engine was an illegal monopoly, but he decided banning them in the future would do more harm than good.",
      "Partially because he is allowing the default deals to continue, Mehta is ordering Google to give its current and would-be rivals access to some of its search engine's secret sauce \u2014 the data stockpiled from trillions of queries that it used to help improve the quality of its search results.",
      "The judge also rejected the U.S. Justice Department's effort to force Google to sell its popular Chrome browser, concluding it was an unwarranted step that \"would be incredibly messy and highly risky.\"",
      "\"Now the Court has imposed limits on how we distribute Google services, and will require us to share Search data with rivals,\" Google said in a statement provided to CBS News following the ruling. \"We have concerns about how these requirements will impact our users and their privacy, and we're reviewing the decision closely. The Court did recognize that divesting Chrome and Android would have gone beyond the case's focus on search distribution, and would have harmed consumers and our partners.\"",
      "\"We proved in court that competition had been frozen in place for two decades in internet search,\" Abigail Slater, assistant attorney general of the Justice Department's Antitrust Division, wrote in a social media post. \"Google's tactics have excluded competition, harming consumers and slowing innovation. Today's remedy order agreed with the need to restore competition to the long-monopolized search market, and we are now weighing our options and thinking through whether the ordered relief goes far enough in serving that goal.\"",
      "Allowing the default search deals to continue is more than just a victory for Google. It's also something that Apple, which receives more than $20 billion annually from Google, and the beneficiaries of the payments urged Mehta to maintain.",
      "In hearings earlier this year, Apple warned the judge that banning the contracts would deprive the company of money that it funnels into its own innovative research. The Cupertino, California, company also cautioned that the ban could have the unintended consequence of making Google even more powerful by pocketing the money it had been spending on deals while most consumers will still end up flocking to Google's search engine anyway.",
      "Others, such as the owners of the Firefox search engine, asserted that losing the Google contracts would threaten their future survival by depriving them of essential revenue.",

      "The operation involved law enforcement agents from multiple federal agencies, including ICE, Border Patrol, the FBI, the Drug Enforcement Administration, the IRS and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, underscoring the government-wide nature of the Trump administration's crackdown on illegal immigration.",
      "Earlier, the Atlanta office of the ATF had said 450 people were detained in\u00a0a post on social media, which included pictures from the operation.",
      "The sweep targeted one of Georgia's largest and most high-profile manufacturing sites, touted by Gov. Brian Kemp and other officials as the biggest economic development project in the state's history. Hyundai Motor Group, South Korea's biggest automaker, began manufacturing electric vehicles a year ago at the $7.6 billion plant, which employs about 1,200 people, and has partnered with LG Energy Solution to build an adjacent battery plant, slated to open next year. The search shut down construction on the battery plant.",
      "The Hyundai Motor Company said in a statement that it was aware of the operation and was \"closely monitoring the situation while working to understand the specific circumstances.\"",
      "\"Based on our current understanding, none of those detained is directly employed by Hyundai Motor Company,\" it said. \"Hyundai is committed to full compliance with all laws and regulations in every market where we operate. This includes employment verification requirements and immigration laws. We expect the same commitment from all our partners, suppliers, contractors, and subcontractors.\"",
      "\"We are reviewing our processes to ensure that all parties working on our projects maintain the same high standards of legal compliance that we demand of ourselves. This includes thorough vetting of employment practices by contractors and subcontractors,\" the company said, in part, adding that it will \"conduct an investigation to ensure all suppliers and their subcontractors comply with all laws and regulations.\"",
      "In a statement to The Associated Press, LG said it was \"closely monitoring the situation and gathering all relevant details.\" It said it couldn't immediately confirm how many of its employees or Hyundai workers had been detained.",
      "\"Our top priority is always ensuring the safety and well-being of our employees and partners. We will fully cooperate with the relevant authorities,\" the company said.",
      "ICE spokesman Lindsay Williams confirmed that federal authorities conducted an enforcement operation at the 3,000-acre site west of Savannah. He said agents were focused on the construction site for the battery plant.",
      "The South Korean Foreign Ministry said in a statement that it was dispatching officials to the site and urged the U.S. Embassy in Seoul \"to exercise extreme caution to ensure that the legitimate rights and interests of Korean citizens are not infringed upon.\"",
      "\"The economic activities of Korean investment companies and the rights and interests of Korean citizens must not be unfairly infringed upon during U.S. law enforcement operations,\" the Foreign Ministry said.",
      "Georgia State Patrol troopers blocked roads to the Hyundai site. The Georgia Department of Public Safety confirmed it was dispatched to assist federal authorities.",
      "Video posted to social media on Thursday showed workers in yellow safety vests lined up as a man wearing a face mask and a tactical vest with the letters HSI, which stands for Homeland Security Investigations, tells them: \"We're Homeland Security. We have a search warrant for the whole site.\"",
      "\"We need construction to cease immediately,\" the man says in the video. \"We need all work to end on the site right now.\"",

    "story": [
      "The Trump administration told Kilmar Abrego Garcia on Friday it is now seeking to deport him to the tiny African kingdom of Eswatini, formerly known as Swaziland, according to an Immigration and Customs Enforcement email obtained by CBS News.",
      "The email from a top ICE official noted that Abrego Garcia's attorneys have warned he fears being persecuted or tortured in Uganda, where federal authorities threatened to deport him last month after he was detained once again by immigration officials following his release from criminal custody.",
      "The ICE official said Abrego Garcia, through his attorneys, has also claimed fear of being harmed if deported to more than 20 countries, most of them in Latin America.",
      "In the email, the official called the alleged claims \"hard to take seriously,\" but added: \"Nonetheless, we hereby notify you that your new country of removal is Eswatini, Africa.\"",
      "CBS News reached out to representatives and an attorney for Abrego Garcia, asking for comment on the Trump administration's threat to send their client to Eswatini.",
      "Eswatini is at least the fourth possible destination that the Trump administration has floated for Abrego Garcia, a native of El Salvador who was mistakenly deported in March, held in a notorious Salvadoran prison and returned to the U.S. in June \u2014 only to face federal smuggling charges.",
      "Africa's sole remaining absolute monarchy, Eswatini is one of several nations that has agreed to the Trump administration's requests to accept deportees who are not their citizens from the U.S. Earlier this year, the U.S. sent a small group of deportees from Asia and Latin America who had been convicted of violent crimes to Eswatini. Attorneys say the men are being held incommunicado in a prison there.",
      "Abrego Garcia was released from pre-trial jail last month, but ICE almost immediately detained him during a check-in appointment with the agency in Baltimore and began processing him for deportation to Uganda. His attorneys have fought that move, and alleged the government offered to deport him to Costa Rica instead if he agreed to a plea deal in his smuggling case.",
      "And on Thursday, federal authorities argued they could have a legal route to deport him to El Salvador a second time. A 2019 immigration court ruling barred the government from sending him to the Central American country, citing a risk of persecution by gangs. But in a filing obtained by CBS News, the government argued those legal protections would be voided if Abrego Garcia's request to reopen his immigration court case is granted.",
      "Despite that legal protection issued in 2019, Abrego Garcia was deported to El Salvador in March, which government lawyers acknowledged was an \"administrative error.\"",
      "A senior Trump administration official said, \"Kilmar Abrego Garcia's lawyers are playing with fire. If their attempts to reopen his immigration case are successful, his own lawyers will have opened the door for his return to El Salvador.\"",
      "Abrego Garcia remains in ICE custody in Virginia while his lawyers fight his criminal charges and deportation proceedings. His possible deportation to Uganda was paused by a federal judge in Maryland until at least next month.",
      "Trump administration fights Abrego Garcia's asylum case",
      "Meanwhile, Abrego Garcia is seeking asylum in the U.S., a legal status granted to people who have a well-founded fear of persecution in another country.",
      "In an immigration court filing Thursday, government lawyers asked a judge not to grant Abrego Garcia's request to reopen his immigration case so he can seek asylum or some other legal protection, like a green card based on his marriage to a U.S. citizen.",
      "The administration argued that Abrego Garcia is not eligible for asylum and other benefits, citing his alleged affiliation with the gang MS-13, his smuggling charges and a domestic violence complaint filed by his wife. The government alleges Abrego Garcia is a member of a foreign terrorist group, since MS-13 has been classified as such by the State Department.",
      "Abrego Garcia has strongly denied any affiliation with MS-13 and has pleaded not guilty to his smuggling charges, which his attorneys have called \"vindictive and selective.\" Abrego Garcia's wife filed a protective order alleging domestic violence in 2021, but she later said she decided not to follow through with the case. Abrego Garcia was not criminally charged in the matter.",
      "Abrego Garcia's attorney Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg told CBS News that if his client \"is allowed a fair trial in immigration court, there's no way he's not going to prevail on his claim for asylum.\"",
      "\"Kilmar Abrego Garcia was tortured in El Salvador's notorious CECOT prison earlier this year,\" he said. \"The only reason he was denied asylum in 2019 was because he did not file within one year of entering the United States, a problem which the government has now solved.\"",

      "The effort, which was first reported by CBS News\u00a0before Mr. Trump signed the order, is aimed at curbing the number of Americans who elect to travel to such countries, and encouraging the leaders of those countries to immediately free Americans currently held there.",
      "Modeled after the designation of state sponsors of terrorism, the measure would provide tools - including sanctions, export controls and travel restrictions for the nationals of designated countries \u2013 for the State Department to penalize nations that use detained Americans as political leverage and potentially issue geographic travel restrictions on where a U.S. passport can be used.",
      "\"So the incredible tools we have as the most powerful nation in the world that we apply to state sponsors of terrorism \u2014 that toolbox is now available, not just to those who sponsor terrorism themselves or through proxies, but will also be available for us to use against those nations who wrongfully detain our citizens,\" a senior administration official said. \"You don't have to be funding, Hamas, Hezbollah or Al-Qaeda. You can simply be trying to exploit our citizens wrongfully.\"",
      "The U.S. government does not publicize the number of Americans detained abroad. According to the Foley Foundation, an advocacy group, at least 54 Americans were held hostage or wrongfully detained in 17 countries during 2024.",
      "The State Department currently issues advisories with four levels of risk to advise Americans planning international travel, topped by \"Level 4: Do not travel.\" There are 21 countries on the \"Do Not Travel\" list, several of which list wrongful detention as a risk to travelers, including Iran, Afghanistan, Russia, Venezuela and North Korea.",
      "The State Department says most U.S. nationals who are arrested overseas are detained due to \"legitimate law enforcement and judicial processes.\"",
      "In President Trump's first term, Congress passed the Robert Levinson Act, which says the State Department can find that a U.S. national is being wrongfully detained based on multiple criteria, including the fairness of the country's judicial system, credible evidence of their innocence or reports that they are being held to extract concessions from the U.S. government.",
      "Levinson, a retired FBI and DEA agent, was kidnapped in Iran in 2007, and the U.S. maintained that he was held wrongfully by the Iranian government. In 2020, U.S. officials said intelligence suggested that he had died.",
      "His daughter, Sarah Levinson, in a statement to CBS News, thanked Mr. Trump, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, advisers Adam Boehler and Sebastian Gorka and FBI Director Kash Patel \"for sending such a powerful message to stop hostage taking.\"",
      "\"We have watched in horror as the practice of taking American citizens hostage as political leverage has not only escalated but run rampant by the acts of many rogue nations,\" Sarah Levinson wrote, adding, \"Our father, Robert Levinson, was wrongfully detained by the Iranian government and ultimately died in Iranian custody after years in captivity. This must never happen again.\"",
      "The executive order follows several high-profile cases in which foreign countries have arrested American citizens on what critics view as flimsy or unsubstantiated charges, before releasing them in exchange for prisoners held in the U.S.",
      "Russian authorities jailed journalist Evan Gershkovich and Marine veteran Paul Whelan for years on widely criticized espionage charges, and returned them to the U.S. in a complicated 2024 trade that involved the German government returning a convicted murderer to Russia.",
      "Whelan said in a statement that the president's executive order \"is a good start and would be a powerful deterrent if truly enforced against rogue regimes such as China and Russia.\" He thanked the CIA and State Department for their work on the cases of those who are wrongfully detained, and he urged Mr. Trump to secure \"compensation for those truly wrongfully detained and use frozen assets from the rogue regimes for that purpose.\"",
      "\"We need to deter the taking of hostages and ensure that once home hostages are taken care of properly. The US government could do much better in both regards,\" Whelan also said.",

      "Washington \u2014 A federal judge in California ruled Friday that the Trump administration's attempt to end the Temporary Protected Status program for hundreds of thousands of Venezuelan and Haitian migrants was unlawful.",
      "The move by U.S. District Judge Edward Chen effectively sets aside the administration's attempt to end temporary legal protections and work permits for certain people from Venezuela and Haiti \u2014 unless his ruling is overturned on appeal. Chen ruled in favor of the National TPS Alliance, an organization that represents TPS holders across the country, and a group of Venezuelan migrants who received protections under the program.",
      "\"This case arose from action taken post haste by the current DHS Secretary, Kristi Noem, to revoke the legal status of Venezuelan and Haitian TPS holders, sending them back to conditions that are so dangerous that even the State Department advises against travel to their home countries,\" Chen wrote in a 69-page decision. \"The Secretary's action in revoking TPS was not only unprecedented in the manner and speed in which it was taken but also violates the law.\"",
      "In May, the Supreme Court allowed the Trump administration to end the TPS program for hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans, freezing an earlier ruling by Chen.",
      "Chen said that decision concerned only preliminary relief he ordered that postponed the Department of Homeland Security's actions. The high court's order, he said, did not bar him from adjudicating the case on the merits or issuing relief under the Administrative Procedure Act, a federal law that governs the agency rulemaking process.",
      "The Justice Department will likely appeal the decision.",
      "The Department of Homeland Security criticized the ruling in a statement, and said Noem will \"use every legal option at the Department's disposal to end this chaos and prioritize the safety of Americans.\"",
      "\"For decades the TPS program has been abused, exploited, and politicized as a de facto amnesty program. Its use has been all the more dangerous given the millions of unvetted illegal aliens the Biden Administration let into this country,\" the statement read.",
      "Congress in 1990 established the Temporary Protected Status program, which allows the federal government to provide temporary immigration protections for migrants from countries experiencing wars, natural disasters, or other \"extraordinary and temporary\" conditions that make it dangerous to send deportees there. The program lets TPS holders temporarily remain in the U.S. and apply for renewable work permits.",
      "During the Biden administration, the Department of Homeland Security designated Venezuela, which is the largest country included in the TPS program, covering roughly 600,000 migrants. It also created or expanded programs for Afghanistan, Cameroon, Haiti and Ukraine. The Biden administration had extended the TPS designations for Venezuela and Haiti.",
      "After President Trump returned to the White House for his second term, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem first sought to reverse the TPS extension for Venezuela, and then moved to terminate the designation altogether. She also sought to unwind TPS protections for Haitians and migrants of several other countries.",
      "The National TPS Alliance and Venezuelan TPS holders filed their lawsuit challenging Noem's decisions in February and argued she did not have the authority to unilaterally roll back the extension granted by her predecessor.",
      "In his decision against the Trump administration, Chen said Noem's attempts to reverse the TPS extensions granted by the Biden administration were \"extraordinary and unusual,\" and marked the first time in the program's 35-year-history that such a step had been taken. He called the decision-making process surrounding the move \"truncated and condensed,\" and said Noem failed to consult the appropriate agencies.",

      "Washington \u2014 Justice Amy Coney Barrett said she sharply responded to a dissenting opinion from Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson in a recent ruling on nationwide injunctions because Jackson had made a \"spirited argument\" that \"merited a spirited response.\"",
      "Barrett discussed the majority opinion she authored in a conversation with CBS News senior correspondent Norah O'Donnell, her first television interview since joining the Supreme Court in 2020. The justice has written a new book, called \"Listening to the Law: Reflections on the Court and Constitution,\" that will hit shelves Sept. 9.",
      "The Supreme Court's ruling in June limited the ability of federal judges to issue nationwide injunctions, which are orders that block enforcement of a policy universally, not just against the plaintiffs in a case. The decision came in a trio of challenges to President Trump's executive order that seeks to end birthright citizenship.",
      "The constitutionality of Mr. Trump's birthright citizenship plan was not before the court, though the justices are likely to be confronted with that question soon.",
      "The Supreme Court divided 6-3 in the case, with the three liberal justices in dissent. Jackson, the newest member of the court, joined the principle dissenting opinion authored by Justice Sonia Sotomayor, and wrote her own.",
      "Writing for the majority, Barrett referenced Jackson several times by name. Barrett wrote that her colleague's \"position is difficult to pin down\" and \"goes far beyond the mainstream defense of universal injunctions.\"",
      "\"We will not dwell on Justice Jackson's argument, which is at odds with more than two centuries' worth of precedent, not to mention the Constitution itself,\" Barrett wrote. \"We observe only this: Justice Jackson decries an imperial Executive while embracing an imperial Judiciary.\"",
      "Asked about her response to Jackson, Barrett said she mentioned her fellow justice by name because she wrote a solo dissent that was not joined by either of the two liberal justices, Sotomayor and Justice Elena Kagan.",
      "\"I did draft the opinion and I think sometimes arguments that are, you know \u2014 you match the tone that's appropriate for the moment,\" Barrett said. \"And Justice Jackson made a formal, a very \u2014 she made a spirited argument, and so I thought it merited a spirited response. But it is about the merits, it was about the case. I have great respect for Justice Jackson.\"",
      "Barrett quoted her former boss, the late Justice Antonin Scalia, who was known for his own sharp opinions and who would say \"I attack ideas. I don't attack people.\"",
      "\"That is the spirit in which, you know, I write my opinions,\" she said.",
      "Asked if there was any \"beef\" with Jackson, Barrett replied, \"Of course not. No.\"",
      "\"One thing I want people to know about the court is that it's a place where we can have disagreements, but still get along, because we can have disagreements that really are confined to the page, that are confined to cases,\" she said. \"And so we can debate ideas, sometimes vigorously, as you pointed out, but it doesn't inhibit us in our ability to be colleagues and friends.\"",

Some of the rules proposed or adopted by the previous administration, however, went beyond what Congress has required by statute, and we intend to reconsider those extra-statutory requirements.\"",
      "\"This action does not change the Department's commitment or intent to carry out the consumer protection mandates from Congress in the recent FAA Reauthorization Act, including provisions relating to refunds. Instead, the action is part of USDOT's effort to ensure the traveling public is treated fairly while also acknowledging the realities of carriers' operations and the impact of overly burdensome regulations on the American people,\" the DOT spokesperson said.",
      "Although airlines guarantee rebooking, plus meals and lodging vouchers, for customers affected by flight delays and cancellations, none guarantee cash compensation for such inconveniences.",

The court concluded that state and federal officials are likely to succeed in showing that the site isn't subject to the National Environmental Policy Act, because it is a state-operated facility and Florida has not yet received any federal reimbursement for the cost of running the site.",
      "The majority ruling was written by Judge Barbara Lagoa and joined by Judge Elizabeth Branch, both of whom were nominated in President Trump's first term. Judge Adalberto Jordan, an Obama nominee, dissented.",
      "DHS lauded the ruling, calling it a \"win for the American people, the rule of law and common sense.\"",
      "\"This lawsuit was never about the environmental impacts of turning a developed airport into a detention facility,\" the department wrote in a post on X. \"It has and will always be about open-borders activists and judges trying to keep law enforcement from removing dangerous criminal aliens from our communities, full stop.\"",
      "Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said in a video on X that Alligator Alcatraz remains \"open for business.\"",
      "\"The mission continues and we're going to continue leading the way when it comes to immigration enforcement,\" he said.",
      "Friends of the Everglades and the Center for Biological Diversity, two of the groups that sued over Alligator Alcatraz, said in a statement they believe the case will ultimately be decided in their favor.",
      "\"While disappointing, we never expected ultimate success to be easy. We're hopeful the preliminary injunction will be affirmed when it's reviewed on its merits during the appeal,\" Friends of the Everglades executive director Eve Samples said.",
      "Center for Biological Diversity senior attorney Elise Bennett said: \"This is a heartbreaking blow to America's Everglades and every living creature there, but the fight isn't even close to over and I'm confident we'll ultimately prevail.\"",
      "Located on an abandoned airstrip, Alligator Alcatraz is part of a wider effort by the Trump administration to increase the number of immigration detention beds as Immigration and Customs Enforcement arrests surge. In some cases, the federal government has partnered with Florida and several other GOP-led states.",
      "The Trump administration has presented Alligator Alcatraz as a cost-effective way of holding detainees and said it serves as a deterrent for undocumented immigrants. But critics have alleged inhumane conditions at the site.",
      "Several other lawsuits have challenged Alligator Alcatraz, including a suit arguing that detainees there have limited access to attorneys. Another suit argues that Florida doesn't have the legal right to operate an immigration detention facility.",

      "Washington\u00a0\u2014 The Defense Department is considering authorizing up to 600 military attorneys to serve as temporary immigration judges, a defense official confirmed.",
      "Chief Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell said in a statement that at the request of the Justice Department, the Defense Department is in the process of \"identifying qualified Judge Advocates and civilian attorneys for details to serve as Temporary Immigration Judges.\"",
      "Parnell said the Defense Department attorneys would help with the backlog of cases \"by presiding over immigration hearings.\" The Associated Press first reported the Pentagon's plans.",
      "The immigration courts are struggling with a backlog of more than 3.4 million cases. But the plan to turn possibly hundreds of military lawyers into immigration judges comes after the Trump administration has fired more than two dozen immigration judges nationwide so far this year. Unlike federal district court judges, immigration judges work for the Justice Department.",
      "Judge Advocate General Corps officers are tasked with providing legal support to service members and their families or advising commanders on the legalities of warfare. The defense lawyers would likely need to undergo some training in immigration law, procedure and policy.",
      "CBS News on Thursday obtained an email that the Defense Department sent to military lawyers in the U.S. Army Reserve on Wednesday seeking 100 volunteers to serve as immigration judges in the Justice Department for a period of 179 days.",
      "\"Applicants must demonstrate a record of sound judgment, legal expertise, analytical ability, wisdom, discernment, and impartiality, along with a professional demeanor, a suitable temperament for the role of a TIJ [Temporary Immigration Judge], and strong written and oral communication skills,\" the email reads.",
      "In the email, the Defense Department urged military lawyers to volunteer because they \"will be directly contributing to the resolution of millions of pending immigration cases, reinforcing the Army Reserve's value to the Nation.\"",
      "The Trump administration loosened the job requirements for temporary immigration judges last month, allowing a wider group of government lawyers to handle cases in immigration court. Its new rule, published in the Federal Register in late August, states that the Justice Department \"no longer believes the restriction of [temporary immigration judges] to current Department employees with a threshold level of immigration law experience serves [the Executive Office for Immigration Review's] interests.\"",
      "Previously, only Justice Department lawyers with a decade of immigration law experience or former immigration judges could fill those roles.",
      "The American Immigration Lawyers Association criticized the plan in a statement after the new rule was published.",
      "\"While DoD attorneys may be well suited to handle military matters, immigration law is entirely different and exceptionally complex,\" AILA said. \"It makes as much sense as having a cardiologist do a hip replacement.\"",
      "\"The work of immigration judges has been described as life and death decisions in traffic court conditions,\" the statement continued. \"Expecting fair decisions from judges unfamiliar with the law is absurd. This reckless move guts due process and further undermines the integrity of our immigration court system.\"",
      "The group called on Congress to use its oversight powers \"to defend the rule of law and protect the independence of the immigration judiciary.\"",
      "In Florida, Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis has already proposed loaning National Guard troops to the federal government for use as immigration judges. He said in May that his office had submitted a proposal to the Trump administration that would activate the nine Florida National Guard members who are Judge Advocate General Corps officers to serve as immigration judges, which legal experts told CBS News is unprecedented.",
      "Typically, when National Guard troops help after a hurricane or secure a protest site, they remain under the command of their state governor, under Title 32 of the U.S. Code. Under DeSantis' plan, the state would relinquish control of these officers to Washington. Title 10 would snap into place, reassigning the JAG officers under the command of the president and defense secretary. This grants them eligibility to serve as federal immigration judges, appointed by the U.S. attorney general.",
      "The Justice Department will pick up the tab for the operation if adopted. It plans to train the officers over six weeks \u2014 a crash course in immigration law, procedure and policy. Each officer would need to pass a written exam before donning the judge's robe.",

    "story": [
      "The deadly U.S. military strike in the Caribbean this week on a boat allegedly carrying drugs from Venezuela is the latest measure President Trump has taken to combat the threat he sees from the Tren de Aragua gang.",
      "The White House has offered few details on Tuesday's attack and insists the 11 people aboard were members of the gang. The criminal organization, which traces its roots to a Venezuelan prison, is not known for having a big role in global drug trafficking but for its involvement in contract killings, extortions and human smuggling.",
      "Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth warned Wednesday that the United States will keep assets positioned in the Caribbean and strike anyone \"trafficking in those waters who we know is a designated narco terrorist.\"",
      "U.S. officials have yet to explain how the military determined that those aboard the vessel were Tren de Aragua members. The strike represents a paradigm shift in how the U.S. is willing to combat drug trafficking in the Western Hemisphere and appears to send a combative message to governments in the region as well as drug traffickers.",
      "Tren de Aragua operations spread beyond Venezuela",
      "Tren de Aragua originated more than a decade ago at an infamously lawless prison with hardened criminals in Venezuela's central state of Aragua. The gang has expanded in recent years, recruiting from among the more than 7.7 million Venezuelans who have fled economic turmoil in their homeland and migrated to other Latin American countries or the U.S.",
      "Mr. Trump and administration officials have consistently blamed the gang for being at the root of the violence and illicit drug dealing that plague some U.S. cities. Mr. Trump has repeated his claim \u2014 contradicted by a declassified U.S. intelligence assessment \u2014 that Tren de Aragua is operating under Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro's control.",
      "During his 2024 presidential campaign, Mr. Trump described Aurora, Colorado, as a \"war zone\" overrun with members of the gang. Aurora Police Chief Todd Chamberlain rejected that characterization, explaining the gang was tied to organized violent crime concentrated in three apartment complexes in the city.",
      "Chamberlain said earlier this year his department had counted a total of nine confirmed Tren de Aragua members who passed through Aurora in the last two years.",
      "The size of the gang is unclear. Countries with large populations of Venezuelan migrants, including Peru and Colombia, have accused the group of being behind a spree of violence in the region.",
      "Authorities in Chile first identified the gang's operations in 2022. Prosecutors and investigators have said the group initially engaged primarily in human trafficking, organizing unauthorized border crossings and sexual exploitation, but over time, members have expanded their activities to more violent crimes, such as kidnapping, torture, extortion and became more involved in drug trafficking.",
      "While Tren de Argua has dominated ketamine trafficking in Chile, unlike other criminal organizations from Colombia, Central America and Brazil, it has no large-scale involvement in smuggling cocaine across international borders, according to InSight Crime, a think tank that last month published a 64-page report on the gang based on two years of research.",
      "\"We've found no direct participation of TdA in the transnational drug trade, although there are cases of them acting as subcontractors for other drug trafficking organizations,\" said Jeremy McDermott, a Colombia-based co-founder of InSight Crime.",
      "McDermott added that with affiliated cells spread across Latin America, it would not be a huge leap for the gang to one day delve into the drug trade.",
      "Landlocked Bolivia and Colombia, with access to the Pacific Ocean and Caribbean Sea and a border with Venezuela, are the world's top cocaine producers.",
      "Trump designated Tren de Aragua a foreign terrorist organization",
      "On his first day in office, Mr. Trump took steps to designate the gang a foreign terrorist organization alongside several Mexican drug cartels. The Biden administration had sanctioned the gang and offered $12 million in rewards for the arrest of three of its leaders.",
      "Mr. Trump's executive order accused the gang of working closely with top Maduro officials \u2014 most notably the former vice president and one-time governor of Aragua state, Tareck El Aissami \u2014 to infiltrate migration flows, flood the U.S. with cocaine and plot against the country. A U.S. intelligence assessment released earlier this year found minimal contact between the gang and low-level officials in the Venezuelan government but said there was no direct coordination between the gang and the government.",
      "In March, Mr. Trump also declared the group an invading force, invoking an 18th century wartime law that allows the U.S. to deport noncitizens without any legal recourse. Under the Alien Enemies Act, the administration sent more than 250 Venezuelan men to a maximum-security prison in El Salvador, where they remained incommunicado and without access to an attorney until their July deportation to Venezuela.",
      "A\u00a0U.S. appeals court panel this week ruled that Mr. Trump cannot use that law to speed deportations of people his administration accuses of being Tren de Aragua members. A final ruling on the matter, however, will be made by the Supreme Court.",
      "The Trump administration alleged the men deported to the prison were members of the Tren de Aragua gang, but provided little evidence. One justification officials used was that the men had certain kinds of tattoos allegedly signifying gang membership, including crowns, clocks and other symbols. But experts have said tattoos are not reliable markers of affiliation to the gang.",
      "Trump cites the gang in justifying the military strike",
      "The U.S. has not released the names and nationalities of the 11 people killed Tuesday. It also has not offered an estimate of the amount of drugs it says the boat was carrying.",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio on Wednesday told reporters the U.S. military will continue lethal strikes on suspected drug trafficking vessels, but he dodged questions on details of the strike, including if the people in the boat were warned before the attack.",
      "But, he said, Mr. Trump \"has a right, under exigent circumstances, to eliminate imminent threats to the United States.\"",
      "\"If you're on a boat full of cocaine or fentanyl or whatever, headed to the United States, you're an immediate threat to the United States,\" he told reporters in Mexico City during a visit to Latin America.",
      "Venezuela's government, which has long minimized the presence of Tren de Aragua in the South American country, limited its reaction to the strike to questioning the veracity of a video showing the attack. Communications Minister Freddy \u00d1\u00e1\u00f1ez suggested it was created using artificial intelligence and described it as an \"almost cartoonish animation, rather than a realistic depiction of an explosion.\"",
      "Hegseth responded that the strike \"was definitely not artificial intelligence,\" adding he watched live footage from Washington as the strike was carried out.",
      "The strike shows that the U.S. government is \"quite literally deadly serious\" in its targeting of drug traffickers, said Ryan Berg, director of the Americas program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington-based think tank.",
      "But he questioned whether the link to Tren de Aragua has more to do with the \"familiarity\" that Americans now have with the gang.",

    "story": [
      "The attorney general for the District of Columbia announced Thursday that the nation's capital is suing the Trump administration over the deployment of National Guard troops within the city's boundaries, alleging the violation amounts to an unconstitutional, \"involuntary military occupation.\"",
      "The suit alleges that President Trump \"has run roughshod over a fundamental tenet of American democracy \u2014 that the military should not be involved in domestic law enforcement.\"",
      "The lawsuit comes as Mr. Trump has declared the use of National Guard troops in D.C. a success, and voiced an interest in expanding his use of military assets to tackle crime in some of the nation's largest cities, including Chicago, Baltimore and New Orleans.",
      "And, it comes on the heels of a similar legal challenge in California meant to blunt that effort. There, a federal judge earlier this week objected to the president's decision in June to deploy troops to Los Angeles, saying the move violated a law known as the Posse Comitatus Act, which sharply limits the use of the military for domestic purposes. The White House has appealed.",
      "\"Deploying the National Guard to engage in law enforcement is not only unnecessary and unwanted, but it is also dangerous and harmful to the District and its residents,\" said D.C. Attorney General Brian L. Schwalb in a statement sent to CBS News.",
      "\"No American city should have the US military \u2014 particularly out-of-state military who are not accountable to the residents and untrained in local law enforcement \u2014 policing its streets,\" Schwalb said. \"It's DC today but could be any other city tomorrow.\"",
      "White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson said in a statement that Mr. Trump was \"well within his lawful authority to deploy the National Guard in Washington\" and said the lawsuit is an attempt to \"undermine\" the president's operation.",
      "Since mid-August, nearly 2,300 National Guard troops have joined the District's police force and an array of federal agencies in stepping up visible patrols around the city. The action has coincided with a noticeable impact on crime numbers. An analysis by CBS News found that crime was down by almost half during the first 19 days of troop deployments in comparison to the same dates the previous year.",
      "But the actions have come over vocal objections from District officials who said they are depriving them of local autonomy.",
      "\"More than 50 years ago, Congress granted the District the right to self-governance and control over local matters, including maintenance of public safety and order,\" Schwalb said in a statement. \"Congress did not give the President authority to participate in local D.C. law enforcement as he sees fit.\"",

      "Even as vaccines \u2014 particularly COVID vaccines \u2014 have sometimes been a political issue, this view on encouraging children's vaccinations is true across party lines for the majority of Democrats, Republicans and independents.

      "The new image from the Gemini Observatory shows the comet's broad coma, or a cloud of dust and gas that forms around its nucleus as it gets closer to the sun, astronomers said in a news release. The tail spans about 1/200th of a degree in the sky. One degree is about the width of a pinky finger, according to the news release. The tail also points away from the sun.",
      "The features are \"significantly more extended than they appeared in earlier images,\" according to astronomers. This means that the comet has become \"more active\" as it travels through the inner solar system.",
      "The main purpose of the observatory session, which allowed students and members of the public to remotely join astronomers in the control room, was to look at the wavelengths of light that emit from the comet. The wavelengths, also called a spectrum, can give scientists information about the comet's composition and chemistry, helping them understand how the comet changes while passing through the solar system, the news release said.",

A trio of authors \u2014 thriller novelist Andrea Bartz and nonfiction writers Charles Graeber and Kirk Wallace Johnson \u2014 sued last year, and now represent a broader group of writers and publishers whose books Anthropic downloaded to train its chatbot Claude.",

      "Alsup's June ruling found that Anthropic had downloaded more than 7 million digitized books that it \"knew had been pirated.\" It started with nearly 200,000 from an online library called Books3, assembled by AI researchers outside of OpenAI to match the vast collections on which ChatGPT was trained.",
      "Debut thriller novel \"The Lost Night\" by Bartz, a lead plaintiff in the case, was among those found in the Books3 dataset.",
      "Anthropic later took at least 5 million copies from the pirate website Library Genesis, or LibGen, and at least 2 million copies from the Pirate Library Mirror, Alsup wrote.",
      "The Authors Guild told its thousands of members last month that it expected \"damages will be minimally $750 per work and could be much higher\" if Anthropic was found at trial to have willfully infringed their copyrights. The settlement's higher award \u2014 approximately $3,000 per work \u2014 likely reflects a smaller pool of affected books, after taking out duplicates and those without copyright.",
      "On Friday, Mary Rasenberger, CEO of the Authors Guild, called the settlement \"an excellent result for authors, publishers, and rightsholders generally, sending a strong message to the AI industry that there are serious consequences when they pirate authors' works to train their AI, robbing those least able to afford it.\"",

      "This comes after Kennedy said in April that HHS would undertake a \"massive testing and research effort\" to determine the cause of autism. Kennedy at the time said the plan was to release a comprehensive report in September. However, National Institutes of Health Director Dr. Jay Bhattacharya said later that month the findings could take up to a year.",

      "In a separate statement in response to the WSJ story, Kenvue, the maker of Tylenol \u2014 whose active ingredient is acetaminophen \u2014 said that \"we have continuously evaluated the science and continue to believe there is no causal link between acetaminophen use during pregnancy and autism. To date, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and leading medical organizations agree on the safety of acetaminophen, its use during pregnancy, and the information provided on the label.\"",
      "Later Friday, Kenvue said in another statement that \"we appreciate the Secretary acknowledging media coverage on the upcoming HHS report is 'nothing more than speculation.'\"",
      "What do medical experts say?",
      "The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists said in a statement provided to CBS News on Friday that \"there is no clear evidence that proves a direct relationship between the prudent use of acetaminophen during pregnancy and fetal developmental issues.\"",
      "\"Neurodevelopmental disorders, in particular, are multifactorial and very difficult to associate with a singular cause,\" ACOG said. \"Pregnant patients should not be frightened away from the many benefits of acetaminophen, which is safe and one of the few options pregnant people have for pain relief.\"",

      "Autism has become more prevalent in children born in the U.S. over the past 25 years, according to\u00a0statistics compiled by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. But there is no scientific consensus on the reasons why.",
      "In an interview with CBS News on Friday, Dr. Christine Ladd-Acosta, an associate professor of epidemiology at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health and the vice director for the Wendy Klag Center for Autism and Developmental Disabilities, said research shows that the causes of autism \"are complex.\"",
      "\"There have been a few dozen studies looking at Tylenol and whether use during pregnancy is associated with risk of autism in those women's children, and the evidence has been really kind of conflicting,\" Ladd-Acosta said. \"Some studies have shown no association. Some have shown a positive association. Some have shown negative associations. And I think part of that is because it's really hard to tease apart ... whether it's the medication itself that is influencing autism risk in the child, or if it has to do with the condition ... the mother is using the medicine to treat that is the thing that is important in autism risk.\"",
      "Ladd-Acosta noted that the dosage, the length of time that pregnant women take Tylenol, and the \"specific condition\" they are taking it for are all factors that have been considered when attempting to determine if there is a potential association between the medication and autism.",

      "Employers added only 22,000 nonfarm jobs in August, far short of Wall Street analyst forecasts of 80,000, while the nation's unemployment rate rose to 4.3% \u2014 the highest level since October of 2021, when the economy was still reeling from the effects of the pandemic. In 2024, the economy added an average of 168,000 per month, labor data shows.",
      "The job market is faltering partly because of the Trump administration's tariffs, which are heightening economic uncertainty, boosting costs for importers and complicating business planning.. Some economists also think that rapid employer adoption of artificial intelligence is hurting demand for recent college graduates and other entry-level workers, although there is ongoing debate among researchers about how much AI is affecting job growth.",
      "\"Uncertainty makes it very, very difficult for people in companies to make decisions,\" Laura Ullrich, director of economic research for North America at job-search firm Indeed and a former official at the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"My former boss says that when you are driving through fog, you slow down \u2014 but if it gets thick enough, you pull over.\"",
      "The Trump administration defended its trade and other economic policies, expressing confidence they will eventually drive growth.",
      "\"President Trump's trade deals have unlocked unprecedented market access for American exports to economies that in total are worth over $32 trillion with 1.2 billion people,\" White House spokesman Kush Desai said in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch. \"As these unprecedented trade deals and the administration's pro-growth domestic agenda of deregulation and historic working-class tax cuts take effect, American businesses and families alike have the certainty that the best is yet to come.\"",
      "In response to the jobs report, President Trump on Friday posted on social media that Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell should have moved sooner to cut interest rates. Lower borrowing costs can stimulate job growth by driving consumer spending and making it cheaper for businesses to expand their operations.",
      "\"Jerome 'Too Late' Powell should have lowered rates long ago. As usual, he's 'Too Late!',\" the president wrote.",

More troubling, the numbers look considerably worse after stripping out the two sectors that showed some of the strongest growth in August \u2014 health care and social assistance. Health care companies created 31,000 new jobs last month, while social assistance \u2014 employers such as food banks and those providing services for disabled people, children and low-income families \u2014 added 16,000 new jobs.",
      "But many other sectors had stagnant or even declining job growth, such as manufacturing, which shed 12,000 jobs in August, and professional and business services, which lost 17,000.",
      "\"Absent the secular gains in health care and social assistance, the cyclical categories of the private service sector (excluding health care and social assistance) have collectively turned negative on average in the past four months,\" Nationwide chief economist Kathy Bostjancic said in a report Friday.",
      "Hiring this summer was also weaker than previously thought. The Labor Department's latest\u00a0data\u00a0shows employers cut 13,000 jobs in June, rather than adding 14,000 new hires as the agency had reported in its first estimate for that month. The June drop marks the first decline in monthly jobs since late 2020.",
      "Although July payroll gains were revised up slightly, total job growth for June and July was 21,000 lower than previously reported, according to the Labor Department.",
      "Job growth is at its lowest level in 15 years",
      "The average monthly job gains since January represent the fewest jobs added over the first eight months of the year in 15 years, excluding the pandemic-triggered crisis period of 2020, Indeed's Ullrich noted.",
      "\"We haven't added this few jobs since 2010, and we have 17 million more people in the labor market than we did then,\" she said. \"That, to me, is a staggering headline.\"",
      "That loss of momentum in creating new jobs is raising concerns about the overall strength of the economy. The nation's gross domestic product \u2014 the total value of goods and services \u2014 is expanding\u00a0more slowly than in 2024, while inflation remains above the Federal Reserve's annual growth target of 2%.",
      "That combination has caused some economists to warn about the risk of the U.S. entering a period of\u00a0\"stagflation,\" a toxic mix of high prices and weak growth. Forecasters expect Consumer Price Index data for August, which is set to be released next week, to show inflation rising at an annual rate of 2.9%, according to financial data firm FactSet.",
      "\"Concerns about the health of the economy are starting to creep in,\" Seema Shah, chief global strategist at Principal Asset Management, said in an email. \"Equally, a strong inflation print next week could strike new fears about a stagflationary mix.\"",
      "The Fed is highly likely to cut interest rates this month",
      "Across the board, economists on Friday said the subpar August jobs report virtually locks in a Federal Reserve interest-rate cut when policymakers meet on Sept. 17.\u00a0 The question is by how much.",
      "August hiring was so anemic that some economists now think the Fed could opt for a 0.5 percentage point cut \u2014 double the typical rate cut \u2014 in a bid to keep the job market on track. Traders now see a 10% chance of a jumbo cut and a 90% likelihood of a 0.25 percentage point reduction, according to CME FedWatch. Prior to Friday's jobs report, the market was completely discounting a jumbo cut, the tool shows.",
      "Some economists also think the Fed will continue trimming rates later in 2025 to counter the weak job market.",
      "\"With the weak job growth, the Fed is cleared to cut rates in September. The question is whether we get [0.25 or 0.50 percentage points],\" Scott Helfstein, Global X's head of investment strategy, said in an email. \"We continue to believe the Fed will ease into the cutting cycle here with one rather than two, but there is some latitude here.\"",

    "story": [
      "In a large-scale immigration enforcement raid at a huge Hyundai facility in Georgia on Thursday, 475 immigrants suspected of living and working in the U.S. illegally were detained, federal authorities announced.",
      "Steven Schrank, the special agent in charge of Homeland Security Investigations in Georgia and Alabama, told reporters Friday that the majority of those detained were Korean nationals, but he didn't know exactly how many. They worked for a variety of different companies at the site, including subcontractors, he said.",
      "No criminal charges were announced during Friday's news conference. The sweep was conducted as part of a monthslong investigation into allegations of unlawful employment practices and other federal crimes, Schrank said. He described Thursday's raid as the largest enforcement operation at a single site in the history of Homeland Security Investigations, which is a unit of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.",
      "\"This operation underscores our commitment to protecting jobs for Georgians and Americans, ensuring a level playing field for businesses that comply with the law, safeguarding the integrity of our economy and protecting workers from exploitation,\" Schrank said.",
      "Some of those detained Thursday allegedly entered the U.S. illegally, and others were accused of overstaying their visas or violating visa waivers by working, Schrank said. Most of the detainees were taken to an ICE facility in Folkston, Georgia, near the Florida-Georgia state line.",
      "\"They will be moved based on their individual circumstances beyond that,\" Schrank said.",
      "ICE said in a statement Friday night that those arrested during the operation were \"found to be working illegally, in violation of the terms of their visas and/or statuses.\" One green card holder from Mexico was arrested after \"being determined to be removable from the U.S. based on multiple criminal convictions,\" ICE said.",
      "The investigation is ongoing, and additional arrests and charges are possible, ICE said.",
      "In ICE's statement Friday night, Schrank said the operation \"sends a clear message that those who exploit the system and undermine our workforce will be held accountable.\"",
      "\"We welcome all companies who want to invest in the U.S., and if they need to bring workers in for building or other projects, that's fine \u2014 but they need to do it the legal way,\" Schrank said.",
      "The president of Georgia's chapter of the AFL-CIO called the raid politically motivated and said ICE has been escalating its presence at workplaces across the state.",
      "\"This raid is the latest in an ongoing campaign of harassment that has targeted immigrant Georgians as they try to earn an honest living,\" Yvonne Brooks said in a statement. \"Arresting and detaining workers, who are exploited every day and risk their lives every day on the job, creates an atmosphere of fear that terrorizes workers and their families and increases the workload burden on their coworkers.\"",
      "The operation involved law enforcement agents from multiple federal agencies, including ICE, Border Patrol, the FBI, the Drug Enforcement Administration, the IRS and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, underscoring the government-wide nature of the Trump administration's crackdown on illegal immigration.",
      "Earlier, the Atlanta office of the ATF had said 450 people were detained in\u00a0a post on social media, which included pictures from the operation.",
      "The sweep targeted one of Georgia's largest and most high-profile manufacturing sites, touted by Gov. Brian Kemp and other officials as the biggest economic development project in the state's history. Hyundai Motor Group, South Korea's biggest automaker, began manufacturing electric vehicles a year ago at the $7.6 billion plant, which employs about 1,200 people, and has partnered with LG Energy Solution to build an adjacent battery plant, slated to open next year. The search shut down construction on the battery plant.",
      "The Hyundai Motor Company said in a statement that it was aware of the operation and was \"closely monitoring the situation while working to understand the specific circumstances.\"",
      "\"Based on our current understanding, none of those detained is directly employed by Hyundai Motor Company,\" it said. \"Hyundai is committed to full compliance with all laws and regulations in every market where we operate. This includes employment verification requirements and immigration laws. We expect the same commitment from all our partners, suppliers, contractors, and subcontractors.\"",
      "\"We are reviewing our processes to ensure that all parties working on our projects maintain the same high standards of legal compliance that we demand of ourselves. This includes thorough vetting of employment practices by contractors and subcontractors,\" the company said, in part, adding that it will \"conduct an investigation to ensure all suppliers and their subcontractors comply with all laws and regulations.\"",
      "In a statement to The Associated Press, LG said it was \"closely monitoring the situation and gathering all relevant details.\" It said it couldn't immediately confirm how many of its employees or Hyundai workers had been detained.",
      "\"Our top priority is always ensuring the safety and well-being of our employees and partners. We will fully cooperate with the relevant authorities,\" the company said.",
      "ICE spokesman Lindsay Williams confirmed that federal authorities conducted an enforcement operation at the 3,000-acre site west of Savannah. He said agents were focused on the construction site for the battery plant.",
      "The South Korean Foreign Ministry said in a statement that it was dispatching officials to the site and urged the U.S. Embassy in Seoul \"to exercise extreme caution to ensure that the legitimate rights and interests of Korean citizens are not infringed upon.\"",
      "\"The economic activities of Korean investment companies and the rights and interests of Korean citizens must not be unfairly infringed upon during U.S. law enforcement operations,\" the Foreign Ministry said.",
      "Georgia State Patrol troopers blocked roads to the Hyundai site. The Georgia Department of Public Safety confirmed it was dispatched to assist federal authorities.",
      "Video posted to social media on Thursday showed workers in yellow safety vests lined up as a man wearing a face mask and a tactical vest with the letters HSI, which stands for Homeland Security Investigations, tells them: \"We're Homeland Security. We have a search warrant for the whole site.\"",
      "\"We need construction to cease immediately,\" the man says in the video. \"We need all work to end on the site right now.\"",
      "The Trump administration has undertaken sweeping ICE operations as part of a mass deportation agenda. Immigration officers have raided farms, construction sites, restaurants and auto repair shops.",
      "The Pew Research Center, citing preliminary Census Bureau data, says the U.S. labor force lost more than 1.2 million immigrants from January through July. That includes people who are in the country illegally as well as legal residents.",
      "Hyundai and LG's battery joint venture, HL-GA Battery Company, said in a statement that it's \"cooperating fully with the appropriate authorities\" and paused construction of the battery site to assist their work.",

    "published": "Fri, 05 Sep 2025 21:30:38 -0400",
    "summary": "The latest employment data could inform the Federal Reserve's next rate decision meeting, set for Sept. 17.",
    "story": [
      "Employers across the U.S. added 22,000 jobs in August, falling short of economists' muted expectations and signaling the labor market is facing sharp headwinds from mounting economic uncertainty amid the Trump administration's wide-ranging tariffs.",
      "The numbers",
      "Economists had forecast payroll gains of 80,000 last month, according to a poll by FactSet.",
      "The unemployment rate rose to 4.3% in August, up from 4.2% in July, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said.",
      "The latest data points to an ongoing slowdown in the labor market, with employers hiring an average of 29,000 each month from June through August, versus 168,000 workers each month in 2024. Revised data shows that employers shed 13,000 jobs in June rather than adding the 14,000 that had been reported a month earlier, marking the first decline since late 2020.",
      "Some companies are paring back hiring plans amid the on-again, off-again uncertainty of the Trump administration's tariffs, which are import duties paid by U.S. companies. Businesses in seven of the Fed's 12 regional districts canvassed in the latest so-called Beige Book, a survey of local economic conditions, said they were hesitant to hire because of weaker demand and uncertainty over the near-term outlook.",
      "\"August's employment report confirmed that the labor market has headed off a cliff-edge,\" Bradley Saunders, North America economist at Capital Economics, said in a Friday research report.",
      "Consumers are also dour, with a new CBS News poll finding that Americans are continuing to rate the U.S. economy negatively, with most respondents picking \"uncertain\" and \"struggling\" to describe its current state.",
      "The August jobs report marks the first since President Trump\u00a0fired former Bureau of Labor Statistics Commissioner Erika McEntarfer on Aug. 1 in the wake of a disappointing July jobs report, which included a significant downward revision of May and June hiring figures.",
      "Citing the large revisions, Mr. Trump questioned the validity of the government data, although the BLS typically revises its prior reports each month based on fresher responses from employers.",
      "The new revisions",
      "On Friday, the BLS revised the prior two months' data, showing that employers shed 13,000 jobs in June, revising the month's hiring downward by 27,000 fewer jobs. That marks the first monthly decline in hiring since December 2020, when the U.S. was in the midst of an economic crisis caused by the pandemic.",
      "The BLS also revised July's jobs numbers upward, showing that employers added 79,000 workers that month, rather than the 73,000 reported in August.",
      "The revisions show that the economy added 21,000 fewer jobs in June and July than had earlier been reported by the BLS.",
      "What economists say",
      "The labor market data is complicating the Federal Reserve's next rate cut decision, which set for Sept. 17. The central bank's dual mandate requires it to ensure that both inflation and unemployment remain low, but inflation has been edging upward, which economists say is partly due to Mr. Trump's tariffs.",
      "The Fed's most powerful weapon for battling inflation is to hike interest rates, yet its best option for helping the job market is to lower borrowing costs, making it cheaper for businesses to expand. With the combination of rising inflation and weaker hiring, the Fed is in a tough position, economists say.",
      "Last month, Fed Chair Jerome Powell, who has been under pressure from Mr. Trump to cut rates, signaled that the central bank is open to reducing rates at its September meeting, citing risks to the labor market.",
      "\"The labor market continues to show fatigue as businesses hold back on hiring amid uncertainty around the direction of inflation, tariffs and the strength of the underlying economy,\" said Joe Gaffoglio, CEO at Mutual of America Capital Management, in an email after the data was released.",
      "\"Recent labor data showed that more individuals are unemployed in the U.S. (7.24 million) than there are available jobs (7.18 million), which hasn't happened since April 2021,\" he added.",
      "The latest data is likely to ensure a rate cut at the Fed's next meeting, experts said on Friday. The lower-than-expected hiring, as well as June's negative revision, could also persuade the central bank to cut later in the year as well, they added.",
      "\"The Federal Reserve needs to cut interest rates in September and probably October and December, too. The 'no hiring' economy is turning to a layoff economy and if that worsens, it will lead to a recession. This needs to be stopped,\" Heather Long, chief economist at Navy Federal Credit Union, said in an email.",

It's a dream he's had since he was a young child and first saw the Louisiana State University Tiger Marching Band and hoped he would someday play tuba for them.",
      "But that day never came. Eventually, Kent became an accountant, started a family, and aged out of the opportunity, or so he thought.",
      "\"No, I wasn't going to do that,\" Kent told CBS News of joining the marching band. \"I wasn't going to play for the LSU band when I was 50.\"",
      "But now, retired at age 66, he thought maybe he could give it another shot. At least that is what he told his wife, Cheryl.",
      "\"At first I was like, 'Do they have like a senior band?'\" Cheryl told CBS News. \"I mean, I wasn't sure what he was exactly talking about. And it was the real band.\"",
      "And so, this retired accountant went back to school, just in the hopes of making the band. Even though he had played tuba as a child, he had completely forgotten his training.",
      "So he relearned and retrained for what was to be a very competitive audition process.",
      "Simon Holoweiko, the LSU Marching Band director, told CBS News he didn't cut Kent any slack.",
      "\"No, there are no breaks when you come here,\" Holoweiko said. \"And we follow that process to get the best possible group we can.\"",
      "Which is why Kent was never really expecting to make the cut, and why he was thrilled when he did.",
      "Kent is now the oldest person in the band by 41 years. His first game is Saturday when the LSU football team hosts the Louisiana Tech Bulldogs. And he hopes his little dot on the field will punctuate the importance of high-stepping out of your comfort zone.",
      "\"Try it,\" Kent said. \"The only thing you can do is fail. Your only failure is not trying.\"",

      "Jackpot winners have the option to either take a lump sum payment of the estimated cash value \u2014 in this case, roughly $826.4 million \u2014 or they can opt to receive their prize as an annuity, paid in 30 graduated payments over 29 years. In either case, those totals are before the Internal Revenue Service takes a cut, as do most states.",
      "Should you take a lump sum payment or annuity option?",
      "Dan Geltrude, a certified public accountant in New Jersey, told CBS News: \"I personally would take the lump sum payment because I feel comfortable in how I can invest my money. However, having that much money for a lot of people is dangerous.\"",
      "Saturday's jackpot is now the second-largest in U.S. lottery history, with an estimated cash value of $826.4 million, according to Powerball. The record $2.04 billion grand prize was won on Nov. 7, 2022, in California.",

      "If you opt for the annuity payment, \"it will take you a while to lose all that money, so that's the safe bet,\" Geltrude said.",

      "So, what to do if you find yourself millions of dollars richer come Sunday morning?",
      "\"Do not tell a soul that you won. You need to keep this quiet,\" Geltrude said. Sign the ticket, put it in a safe place, and keep it on the down-low. You'll want to seek out an attorney, a certified public accountant and a financial adviser, Geltrude said.",

      "The move by U.S. District Judge Edward Chen effectively sets aside the administration's attempt to end temporary legal protections and work permits for certain people from Venezuela and Haiti \u2014 unless his ruling is overturned on appeal. Chen ruled in favor of the National TPS Alliance, an organization that represents TPS holders across the country, and a group of Venezuelan migrants who received protections under the program.",
      "\"This case arose from action taken post haste by the current DHS Secretary, Kristi Noem, to revoke the legal status of Venezuelan and Haitian TPS holders, sending them back to conditions that are so dangerous that even the State Department advises against travel to their home countries,\" Chen wrote in a 69-page decision. \"The Secretary's action in revoking TPS was not only unprecedented in the manner and speed in which it was taken but also violates the law.\"",
      "In May, the Supreme Court allowed the Trump administration to end the TPS program for hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans, freezing an earlier ruling by Chen.",
      "Chen said that decision concerned only preliminary relief he ordered that postponed the Department of Homeland Security's actions. The high court's order, he said, did not bar him from adjudicating the case on the merits or issuing relief under the Administrative Procedure Act, a federal law that governs the agency rulemaking process.",
      "The Justice Department will likely appeal the decision.",

      "Congress in 1990 established the Temporary Protected Status program, which allows the federal government to provide temporary immigration protections for migrants from countries experiencing wars, natural disasters, or other \"extraordinary and temporary\" conditions that make it dangerous to send deportees there. The program lets TPS holders temporarily remain in the U.S. and apply for renewable work permits.",
      "During the Biden administration, the Department of Homeland Security designated Venezuela, which is the largest country included in the TPS program, covering roughly 600,000 migrants. It also created or expanded programs for Afghanistan, Cameroon, Haiti and Ukraine. The Biden administration had extended the TPS designations for Venezuela and Haiti.",
      "After President Trump returned to the White House for his second term, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem first sought to reverse the TPS extension for Venezuela, and then moved to terminate the designation altogether. She also sought to unwind TPS protections for Haitians and migrants of several other countries.",
      "The National TPS Alliance and Venezuelan TPS holders filed their lawsuit challenging Noem's decisions in February and argued she did not have the authority to unilaterally roll back the extension granted by her predecessor.",
      "In his decision against the Trump administration, Chen said Noem's attempts to reverse the TPS extensions granted by the Biden administration were \"extraordinary and unusual,\" and marked the first time in the program's 35-year-history that such a step had been taken. He called the decision-making process surrounding the move \"truncated and condensed,\" and said Noem failed to consult the appropriate agencies.",

    "story": [
      "Giorgio Armani leaves a legacy not only as a seminal figure in the history of fashion, but also as a visionary business leader who built a globally recognized brand and multibillion-dollar business empire, industry experts said after his death Thursday at age 91.",
      "\"Armani made certain that his vision was consistent and that it was always classy, even down to presentation in the Armani Exchange stores,\" Shawn Grain Carter, an associate professor at the Fashion Institute of Technology, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Armani, or \"Re Giorgio\" (King George) as the Italians call him, famously created luxury looks for Hollywood stars, while also producing stylish accessories and clothing for everyday consumers.",
      "While meticulously tailored clothing made from quality fabrics has always been at the heart of the Armani brand, the designer expanded his business over the years to include not just perfumes and accessories but home furnishings, cosmetics, books, flowers \u2014 even chocolates. Connecting them all was sophisticated design, which Armani wove into all things he put his name on.",
      "\"He was masterful in sticking to his vision, but executing it in a way that would be accessible luxury, a quiet luxury, but still tasteful and elegantly crafted,\" Grain Carter said.",
      "Among Armani's most celebrated contributions and successful business maneuvers was the power suit, a softly tailored, ready-to-wear take on office attire that quickly rose in popularity among the American business class.",
      "Introduced in the '70s, the Armani suit was a bold deviation from the rigid, restrictive suits businessmen were accustomed to wearing. Armani's elegantly tailored suits quickly became a must in every well-heeled man's closet.",
      "Beth Dincuff, an associate professor at New York's Parsons School of Design, said Armani cultivated the idea of a \"sophisticated man who cared about how he looked, who was aware of his physique and who wanted to show it off in a new way.\"",
      "Armani soon brought that masculine sensibility to women's fashion with the pantsuit, a shoulder-padded jacket and tailored trousers. This gave women a refined option for the office that projected confidence and power.",
      "\"That's attributed to Giorgio Armani \u2014 making it OK for a woman to wear a pantsuit but still look like a woman in terms of a power aesthetic,\" said Grain Carter.",
      "Armani's designs also had a knack for tapping into the zeitgeist. He\u00a0told CBS News in 2006 that his new line of women's clothes was in response to the feminist movement. Women needed their own version of the traditional men's suit jacket, Armani thought.",
      "Celebrities and Armani",
      "Using celebrities to elevate the Armani brand was another to key to the designer's business success. He began by outfitting Richard Gere in the 1980 neo-noir crime drama \"American Gigolo.\" Armani went on to design clothes for more than 150 films throughout his career.",
      "\"His idea to reach out to celebrities was very, very important,\" said Dincuff, noting that this approach to marketing fashion was novel at the time.",
      "Armani pivoted to dressing celebrities on the red carpet in the 1990s, where his\u00a0black-tie outfits and glittering evening gowns often stole the show. Some early looks that captured popular attention included the oversized Armani suit worn by Julia Roberts at the 1990s Golden Globes and a champagne-colored Armani suit that Jodie Foster wore at the 1992 Academy Awards.",
      "The list of celebrities that have\u00a0worn Armani on the red carpet is long and includes Beyonc\u00e9, Selena Gomez, \u00a0Anne Hathaway, Michelle Pfeiffer, Margot Robbie and Winona Ryder.",
      "His own boss",
      "Central to Armani's success was the fact that he never relinquished control of the multibillion company he created, experts told CBS MoneyWatch. In rejecting a merger or sale to a larger industry rival, the Italian fashion designer was always his own boss.",
      "This allowed Armani to maintain creative control and consistency over his expanding business empire, distinguishing him from other designers.",
      "While he did strike several licensing deals over his career with companies like EssilorLuxottica\u00a0and\u00a0L'Or\u00e9al, he kept the majority of his business portfolio in-house. That included everything from Armani Priv\u00e9, his haute couture fashion collection and fragrance line, to Armani Exchange \u2014 a more affordable fashion line geared toward younger generations, said Grain Carter. Armani also kept the collections Giorgio Armani and Emporio Armani under his purview.",
      "\"All of this was in-house and he controlled it from concept to production to distribution to marketing to how it is financed,\" Grain Carter said. \"He was active at every level, at every step.\"",
      "Today, the Armani empire has more than 9,000 employees along with seven industrial hubs and over 600 stores worldwide, according to figures released in 2023.",
      "As for potential succession plans, the Giorgio Armani company did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "\"I cannot really contemplate the next person, because there will be no other Giorgio Armani,\" Grain Carter said.",

      "Books are known to be important sources of data \u2014 in essence, billions of words carefully strung together \u2014 that are needed to build the AI large language models behind chatbots like Anthropic's Claude and its chief rival, OpenAI's ChatGPT.",
      "Alsup's June ruling found that Anthropic had downloaded more than 7 million digitized books that it \"knew had been pirated.\" It started with nearly 200,000 from an online library called Books3, assembled by AI researchers outside of OpenAI to match the vast collections on which ChatGPT was trained.",
      "Debut thriller novel \"The Lost Night\" by Bartz, a lead plaintiff in the case, was among those found in the Books3 dataset.",
      "Anthropic later took at least 5 million copies from the pirate website Library Genesis, or LibGen, and at least 2 million copies from the Pirate Library Mirror, Alsup wrote.",
      "The Authors Guild told its thousands of members last month that it expected \"damages will be minimally $750 per work and could be much higher\" if Anthropic was found at trial to have willfully infringed their copyrights. The settlement's higher award \u2014 approximately $3,000 per work \u2014 likely reflects a smaller pool of affected books, after taking out duplicates and those without copyright.",
      "On Friday, Mary Rasenberger, CEO of the Authors Guild, called the settlement \"an excellent result for authors, publishers, and rightsholders generally, sending a strong message to the AI industry that there are serious consequences when they pirate authors' works to train their AI, robbing those least able to afford it.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Justice Amy Coney Barrett said she sharply responded to a dissenting opinion from Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson in a recent ruling on nationwide injunctions because Jackson had made a \"spirited argument\" that \"merited a spirited response.\"",
      "Barrett discussed the majority opinion she authored in a conversation with CBS News senior correspondent Norah O'Donnell, her first television interview since joining the Supreme Court in 2020. The justice has written a new book, called \"Listening to the Law: Reflections on the Court and Constitution,\" that will hit shelves Sept. 9.",
      "The Supreme Court's ruling in June limited the ability of federal judges to issue nationwide injunctions, which are orders that block enforcement of a policy universally, not just against the plaintiffs in a case. The decision came in a trio of challenges to President Trump's executive order that seeks to end birthright citizenship.",
      "The constitutionality of Mr. Trump's birthright citizenship plan was not before the court, though the justices are likely to be confronted with that question soon.",
      "The Supreme Court divided 6-3 in the case, with the three liberal justices in dissent. Jackson, the newest member of the court, joined the principle dissenting opinion authored by Justice Sonia Sotomayor, and wrote her own.",
      "Writing for the majority, Barrett referenced Jackson several times by name. Barrett wrote that her colleague's \"position is difficult to pin down\" and \"goes far beyond the mainstream defense of universal injunctions.\"",
      "\"We will not dwell on Justice Jackson's argument, which is at odds with more than two centuries' worth of precedent, not to mention the Constitution itself,\" Barrett wrote. \"We observe only this: Justice Jackson decries an imperial Executive while embracing an imperial Judiciary.\"",
      "Asked about her response to Jackson, Barrett said she mentioned her fellow justice by name because she wrote a solo dissent that was not joined by either of the two liberal justices, Sotomayor and Justice Elena Kagan.",
      "\"I did draft the opinion and I think sometimes arguments that are, you know \u2014 you match the tone that's appropriate for the moment,\" Barrett said. \"And Justice Jackson made a formal, a very \u2014 she made a spirited argument, and so I thought it merited a spirited response. But it is about the merits, it was about the case. I have great respect for Justice Jackson.\"",
      "Barrett quoted her former boss, the late Justice Antonin Scalia, who was known for his own sharp opinions and who would say \"I attack ideas. I don't attack people.\"",
      "\"That is the spirit in which, you know, I write my opinions,\" she said.",
      "Asked if there was any \"beef\" with Jackson, Barrett replied, \"Of course not. No.\"",
      "\"One thing I want people to know about the court is that it's a place where we can have disagreements, but still get along, because we can have disagreements that really are confined to the page, that are confined to cases,\" she said. \"And so we can debate ideas, sometimes vigorously, as you pointed out, but it doesn't inhibit us in our ability to be colleagues and friends.\"",

    "story": [
      "A former Alaska Airlines pilot accused of trying to cut the engines of a passenger flight in 2023 while riding off-duty in the cockpit pleaded guilty in federal court on Friday as part of an agreement with prosecutors. He's expected to plead no-contest to state charges, which carries the same legal effect as a guilty plea.",
      "Joseph Emerson told\u00a0CBS News in July he takes full responsibility for the night in October 2023. His attorney, Noah Horst, said the plea agreement was reached because Emerson wants to take responsibility for his actions and hopes to avoid further time behind bars.",
      "Emerson was subdued by the flight crew after trying to cut the engines of a Horizon Air flight from Everett, Washington, to San Francisco on Oct. 22, 2023. He was riding in the cockpit jump seat behind the pilot and first officer. The plane was diverted to Portland, where it landed safely with more than 80 people on board.",
      "Emerson told police he was despondent over a friend's recent death, had taken psychedelic mushrooms about two days earlier, and hadn't slept in over 40 hours. He has said he believed he was dreaming at the time and that he was trying to wake himself up by grabbing two red handles that would have activated the plane's fire suppression system and cut off fuel to its engines.",
      "\"You're not going home. You need to wake up. That's when I acted. I pulled the handles that were in front of my face,\" Emerson told CBS News he recalled thinking at the time.",
      "Emerson of Pleasant Hill, California, was charged in federal court with interfering with a flight crew. A state indictment in Oregon separately charged him with 83 counts of endangering another person and one count of endangering an aircraft.",
      "He previously pleaded not guilty to all the charges, and in December 2023 he was released from custody pending trial, with requirements that he undergo mental health services, stay off drugs and alcohol, and keep away from aircraft.",
      "Under the federal agreement, prosecutors can recommend that Emerson serve up to a year in prison, while his attorneys will ask that he serve no additional time. The conditions of the state agreement include five years of probation, 664 hours of community service \u2014 eight hours for each person he endangered \u2014 and $60,569 in restitution, nearly all of it to Alaska Air Group, Horst said.",
      "Half of his community service can be performed at a pilot health nonprofit,\u00a0Clear Skies Ahead, Emerson founded with his wife after his arrest. He must also undergo assessments for drug and alcohol and mental health treatment, refrain from using any non-prescribed drugs, and keep at least 25 feet away from operable aircraft unless he has permission from his probation officer.

      "Reuters was the first to report that the Transportation Department was shelving the proposal.",
      "The proposal was introduced under President Biden and then-Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg. It would've required airlines to pay up to $300 for domestic delays of three to six hours and up to $775 for flight delays lasting at least nine hours.",
      "\"The ability of airlines to choose the services that they provide to mitigate passenger inconveniences resulting from flight disruptions under current U.S. law contrasts with consumer protection regimes in other jurisdiction,\" the proposed rule states.",

Some of the rules proposed or adopted by the previous administration, however, went beyond what Congress has required by statute, and we intend to reconsider those extra-statutory requirements.\"",
      "\"This action does not change the Department's commitment or intent to carry out the consumer protection mandates from Congress in the recent FAA Reauthorization Act, including provisions relating to refunds. Instead, the action is part of USDOT's effort to ensure the traveling public is treated fairly while also acknowledging the realities of carriers' operations and the impact of overly burdensome regulations on the American people,\" the DOT spokesperson said.",
      "Although airlines guarantee rebooking, plus meals and lodging vouchers, for customers affected by flight delays and cancellations, none guarantee cash compensation for such inconveniences.",

The intruder terrorized the women, sometimes calling their homes or threatening to kill them if they reported the incidents to police, the district attorney's office said.",

In March 2024, investigators determined the DNA from the two cases matched, the district attorney's office said.",

After Ventura County investigators reached out to law enforcement in Michigan and Ohio, the agencies launched a joint investigation and worked with an investigative genealogist from the Columbus Police Department.",

His body had been cremated, leaving police unable to obtain a DNA sample from his remains, but investigators found the records from the 1997 Indiana rape case, where he had been named a suspect.

    "summary": "The operation targeted one of Georgia's largest and most high-profile manufacturing sites, where Hyundai makes electric vehicles and is building an EV battery plant.",
    "story": [
      "In a large-scale immigration enforcement raid at a huge Hyundai facility in Georgia on Thursday, 475 immigrants suspected of living and working in the U.S. illegally were detained, federal authorities announced.",
      "Steven Schrank, the special agent in charge of Homeland Security Investigations in Georgia and Alabama, told reporters Friday that the majority of those detained were Korean nationals, but he didn't know exactly how many. They worked for a variety of different companies at the site, including subcontractors, he said.",
      "No criminal charges were announced during Friday's news conference. The sweep was conducted as part of a monthslong investigation into allegations of unlawful employment practices and other federal crimes, Schrank said. He described Thursday's raid as the largest enforcement operation at a single site in the history of Homeland Security Investigations, which is a unit of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.",
      "\"This operation underscores our commitment to protecting jobs for Georgians and Americans, ensuring a level playing field for businesses that comply with the law, safeguarding the integrity of our economy and protecting workers from exploitation,\" Schrank said.",
      "Some of those detained Thursday allegedly entered the U.S. illegally, and others were accused of overstaying their visas or violating visa waivers by working, Schrank said. Most of the detainees were taken to an ICE facility in Folkston, Georgia, near the Florida-Georgia state line.",
      "\"They will be moved based on their individual circumstances beyond that,\" Schrank said.",
      "ICE said in a statement Friday night that those arrested during the operation were \"found to be working illegally, in violation of the terms of their visas and/or statuses.\" One green card holder from Mexico was arrested after \"being determined to be removable from the U.S. based on multiple criminal convictions,\" ICE said.",
      "The investigation is ongoing, and additional arrests and charges are possible, ICE said.",
      "In ICE's statement Friday night, Schrank said the operation \"sends a clear message that those who exploit the system and undermine our workforce will be held accountable.\"",
      "\"We welcome all companies who want to invest in the U.S., and if they need to bring workers in for building or other projects, that's fine \u2014 but they need to do it the legal way,\" Schrank said.",
      "The president of Georgia's chapter of the AFL-CIO called the raid politically motivated and said ICE has been escalating its presence at workplaces across the state.",
      "\"This raid is the latest in an ongoing campaign of harassment that has targeted immigrant Georgians as they try to earn an honest living,\" Yvonne Brooks said in a statement. \"Arresting and detaining workers, who are exploited every day and risk their lives every day on the job, creates an atmosphere of fear that terrorizes workers and their families and increases the workload burden on their coworkers.\"",
      "The operation involved law enforcement agents from multiple federal agencies, including ICE, Border Patrol, the FBI, the Drug Enforcement Administration, the IRS and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, underscoring the government-wide nature of the Trump administration's crackdown on illegal immigration.",
      "Earlier, the Atlanta office of the ATF had said 450 people were detained in\u00a0a post on social media, which included pictures from the operation.",
      "The sweep targeted one of Georgia's largest and most high-profile manufacturing sites, touted by Gov. Brian Kemp and other officials as the biggest economic development project in the state's history. Hyundai Motor Group, South Korea's biggest automaker, began manufacturing electric vehicles a year ago at the $7.6 billion plant, which employs about 1,200 people, and has partnered with LG Energy Solution to build an adjacent battery plant, slated to open next year. The search shut down construction on the battery plant.",
      "The Hyundai Motor Company said in a statement that it was aware of the operation and was \"closely monitoring the situation while working to understand the specific circumstances.\"",
      "\"Based on our current understanding, none of those detained is directly employed by Hyundai Motor Company,\" it said. \"Hyundai is committed to full compliance with all laws and regulations in every market where we operate. This includes employment verification requirements and immigration laws. We expect the same commitment from all our partners, suppliers, contractors, and subcontractors.\"",
      "\"We are reviewing our processes to ensure that all parties working on our projects maintain the same high standards of legal compliance that we demand of ourselves. This includes thorough vetting of employment practices by contractors and subcontractors,\" the company said, in part, adding that it will \"conduct an investigation to ensure all suppliers and their subcontractors comply with all laws and regulations.\"",
      "In a statement to The Associated Press, LG said it was \"closely monitoring the situation and gathering all relevant details.\" It said it couldn't immediately confirm how many of its employees or Hyundai workers had been detained.",
      "\"Our top priority is always ensuring the safety and well-being of our employees and partners. We will fully cooperate with the relevant authorities,\" the company said.",
      "ICE spokesman Lindsay Williams confirmed that federal authorities conducted an enforcement operation at the 3,000-acre site west of Savannah. He said agents were focused on the construction site for the battery plant.",
      "The South Korean Foreign Ministry said in a statement that it was dispatching officials to the site and urged the U.S. Embassy in Seoul \"to exercise extreme caution to ensure that the legitimate rights and interests of Korean citizens are not infringed upon.\"",
      "\"The economic activities of Korean investment companies and the rights and interests of Korean citizens must not be unfairly infringed upon during U.S. law enforcement operations,\" the Foreign Ministry said.",
      "Georgia State Patrol troopers blocked roads to the Hyundai site. The Georgia Department of Public Safety confirmed it was dispatched to assist federal authorities.",
      "Video posted to social media on Thursday showed workers in yellow safety vests lined up as a man wearing a face mask and a tactical vest with the letters HSI, which stands for Homeland Security Investigations, tells them: \"We're Homeland Security. We have a search warrant for the whole site.\"",
      "\"We need construction to cease immediately,\" the man says in the video. \"We need all work to end on the site right now.\"",
      "The Trump administration has undertaken sweeping ICE operations as part of a mass deportation agenda. Immigration officers have raided farms, construction sites, restaurants and auto repair shops.",
      "The Pew Research Center, citing preliminary Census Bureau data, says the U.S. labor force lost more than 1.2 million immigrants from January through July. That includes people who are in the country illegally as well as legal residents.",

      "The image of comet 3I/ATLAS was captured on Aug. 27 using one of the telescopes at the International Gemini Observatory in Chile during a public outreach event allowing students to work with astronomers.",
      "The comet is only the third-known interstellar object to pass through our solar system. It poses no threat to Earth, NASA previously said.",
      "Comet 3I/ATLAS has been photographed multiple times since its discovery in July. In early August, NASA and the European Space Agency released photos taken by the Hubble Space Telescope. It was about 277 million miles away from Earth when the telescope captured it.",
      "The new image from the Gemini Observatory shows the comet's broad coma, or a cloud of dust and gas that forms around its nucleus as it gets closer to the sun, astronomers said in a news release. The tail spans about 1/200th of a degree in the sky. One degree is about the width of a pinky finger, according to the news release. The tail also points away from the sun.",
      "The features are \"significantly more extended than they appeared in earlier images,\" according to astronomers. This means that the comet has become \"more active\" as it travels through the inner solar system.",
      "The main purpose of the observatory session, which allowed students and members of the public to remotely join astronomers in the control room, was to look at the wavelengths of light that emit from the comet. The wavelengths, also called a spectrum, can give scientists information about the comet's composition and chemistry, helping them understand how the comet changes while passing through the solar system, the news release said.",
      "NASA previously said the comet is expected to make its closest approach to the sun in late October and pass between the orbits of Mars and Earth. The comet is expected to remain visible through September, then get too close to the sun to observe until it reappears on the other side of the solar body in early December.",

    "story": [
      "The deadly U.S. military strike in the Caribbean this week on a boat allegedly carrying drugs from Venezuela is the latest measure President Trump has taken to combat the threat he sees from the Tren de Aragua gang.",
      "The White House has offered few details on Tuesday's attack and insists the 11 people aboard were members of the gang. The criminal organization, which traces its roots to a Venezuelan prison, is not known for having a big role in global drug trafficking but for its involvement in contract killings, extortions and human smuggling.",
      "Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth warned Wednesday that the United States will keep assets positioned in the Caribbean and strike anyone \"trafficking in those waters who we know is a designated narco terrorist.\"",
      "U.S. officials have yet to explain how the military determined that those aboard the vessel were Tren de Aragua members. The strike represents a paradigm shift in how the U.S. is willing to combat drug trafficking in the Western Hemisphere and appears to send a combative message to governments in the region as well as drug traffickers.",
      "Tren de Aragua operations spread beyond Venezuela",
      "Tren de Aragua originated more than a decade ago at an infamously lawless prison with hardened criminals in Venezuela's central state of Aragua. The gang has expanded in recent years, recruiting from among the more than 7.7 million Venezuelans who have fled economic turmoil in their homeland and migrated to other Latin American countries or the U.S.",
      "Mr. Trump and administration officials have consistently blamed the gang for being at the root of the violence and illicit drug dealing that plague some U.S. cities. Mr. Trump has repeated his claim \u2014 contradicted by a declassified U.S. intelligence assessment \u2014 that Tren de Aragua is operating under Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro's control.",
      "During his 2024 presidential campaign, Mr. Trump described Aurora, Colorado, as a \"war zone\" overrun with members of the gang. Aurora Police Chief Todd Chamberlain rejected that characterization, explaining the gang was tied to organized violent crime concentrated in three apartment complexes in the city.",
      "Chamberlain said earlier this year his department had counted a total of nine confirmed Tren de Aragua members who passed through Aurora in the last two years.",
      "The size of the gang is unclear. Countries with large populations of Venezuelan migrants, including Peru and Colombia, have accused the group of being behind a spree of violence in the region.",
      "Authorities in Chile first identified the gang's operations in 2022. Prosecutors and investigators have said the group initially engaged primarily in human trafficking, organizing unauthorized border crossings and sexual exploitation, but over time, members have expanded their activities to more violent crimes, such as kidnapping, torture, extortion and became more involved in drug trafficking.",
      "While Tren de Argua has dominated ketamine trafficking in Chile, unlike other criminal organizations from Colombia, Central America and Brazil, it has no large-scale involvement in smuggling cocaine across international borders, according to InSight Crime, a think tank that last month published a 64-page report on the gang based on two years of research.",
      "\"We've found no direct participation of TdA in the transnational drug trade, although there are cases of them acting as subcontractors for other drug trafficking organizations,\" said Jeremy McDermott, a Colombia-based co-founder of InSight Crime.",
      "McDermott added that with affiliated cells spread across Latin America, it would not be a huge leap for the gang to one day delve into the drug trade.",
      "Landlocked Bolivia and Colombia, with access to the Pacific Ocean and Caribbean Sea and a border with Venezuela, are the world's top cocaine producers.",
      "Trump designated Tren de Aragua a foreign terrorist organization",
      "On his first day in office, Mr. Trump took steps to designate the gang a foreign terrorist organization alongside several Mexican drug cartels. The Biden administration had sanctioned the gang and offered $12 million in rewards for the arrest of three of its leaders.",
      "Mr. Trump's executive order accused the gang of working closely with top Maduro officials \u2014 most notably the former vice president and one-time governor of Aragua state, Tareck El Aissami \u2014 to infiltrate migration flows, flood the U.S. with cocaine and plot against the country. A U.S. intelligence assessment released earlier this year found minimal contact between the gang and low-level officials in the Venezuelan government but said there was no direct coordination between the gang and the government.",
      "In March, Mr. Trump also declared the group an invading force, invoking an 18th century wartime law that allows the U.S. to deport noncitizens without any legal recourse. Under the Alien Enemies Act, the administration sent more than 250 Venezuelan men to a maximum-security prison in El Salvador, where they remained incommunicado and without access to an attorney until their July deportation to Venezuela.",
      "A\u00a0U.S. appeals court panel this week ruled that Mr. Trump cannot use that law to speed deportations of people his administration accuses of being Tren de Aragua members. A final ruling on the matter, however, will be made by the Supreme Court.",
      "The Trump administration alleged the men deported to the prison were members of the Tren de Aragua gang, but provided little evidence. One justification officials used was that the men had certain kinds of tattoos allegedly signifying gang membership, including crowns, clocks and other symbols. But experts have said tattoos are not reliable markers of affiliation to the gang.",
      "Trump cites the gang in justifying the military strike",
      "The U.S. has not released the names and nationalities of the 11 people killed Tuesday. It also has not offered an estimate of the amount of drugs it says the boat was carrying.",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio on Wednesday told reporters the U.S. military will continue lethal strikes on suspected drug trafficking vessels, but he dodged questions on details of the strike, including if the people in the boat were warned before the attack.",
      "But, he said, Mr. Trump \"has a right, under exigent circumstances, to eliminate imminent threats to the United States.\"",
      "\"If you're on a boat full of cocaine or fentanyl or whatever, headed to the United States, you're an immediate threat to the United States,\" he told reporters in Mexico City during a visit to Latin America.",
      "Venezuela's government, which has long minimized the presence of Tren de Aragua in the South American country, limited its reaction to the strike to questioning the veracity of a video showing the attack. Communications Minister Freddy \u00d1\u00e1\u00f1ez suggested it was created using artificial intelligence and described it as an \"almost cartoonish animation, rather than a realistic depiction of an explosion.\"",
      "Hegseth responded that the strike \"was definitely not artificial intelligence,\" adding he watched live footage from Washington as the strike was carried out.",
      "The strike shows that the U.S. government is \"quite literally deadly serious\" in its targeting of drug traffickers, said Ryan Berg, director of the Americas program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington-based think tank.",
      "But he questioned whether the link to Tren de Aragua has more to do with the \"familiarity\" that Americans now have with the gang.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/rubio-us-designating-ecuador-gangs-foreign-terrorist-groups/",
    "published": "Thu, 04 Sep 2025 13:56:03 -0400",
    "summary": "The announcement targeting Los Lobos and Los Choneros came after a lethal U.S. military strike\u200b against a similarly designated gang in Venezuela.",
    "story": [
      "U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Thursday that the United States is designating two Ecuadorian gangs as foreign terrorist organizations in the Trump administration's latest move against cartels.",
      "The announcement came as Rubio traveled to Ecuador to meet with its leaders in a trip to Latin America this week that has been overshadowed by a U.S. military strike against a similarly designated gang, Tren de Aragua. The strike has raised concerns in the region about whether the Trump administration will step up military activity to combat drug trafficking and illegal migration.",
      "The two new designees, Los Lobos and Los Choneros, are Ecuadorian gangs blamed for much of the violence that began since the COVID-19 pandemic. The designation, Rubio said, brings \"all sorts of options\" for the U.S. government to work in conjunction with the government of Ecuador to crack down on these groups.",
      "That includes the ability to kill them as well as take action against the properties and banking accounts in the U.S. for the group's members and people with ties to the criminal organizations, Rubio said, adding it would also help with intelligence sharing.",
      "Rubio called them \"vicious animals, these terrorists.\"",
      "Criminal gang violence continues unabated following the recapture in June of the country's biggest drug lord,\u00a0Adolfo Mac\u00edas, who leads Los Choneros, after his escape from a maximum-security prison in 2024. In July, the Ecuadoran government extradited Macias to the United States, where he faces multiple drug trafficking and firearms charges.",
      "Last year, the U.S. classified Los Choneros as one of the most violent gangs and affirmed its connection to powerful\u00a0Mexican drug cartels who threaten Ecuador and the surrounding region.",
      "Earlier this year, a leader of Los Lobos was\u00a0arrested at his home in the coastal city of Portoviejo. Carlos D, widely known by his alias El Chino, was the second-in-command of Los Lobos and \"considered a high-value target,\" the armed forces said in a statement.",
      "The U.S. last year declared Los Lobos to be the largest drug trafficking organization in Ecuador.",
      "\"Interdiction doesn't work\"",
      "Rubio's meetings in Quito on Thursday follow talks a day earlier with Mexican leaders that were overshadowed by the U.S. military strike on suspected Tren de Aragua drug runners in the southern Caribbean.",
      "The Trump administration asserts that it targeted a Venezuelan drug-running ship crewed by members of Tren de Aragua. U.S. officials say the vessel's cargo was intended for the United States and that the strike killed 11 people.",
      "Rubio defended the action and offered no justification other than to say the boat posed an \"immediate threat\" to the U.S. and that Trump opted to \"blow it up\" rather than follow what had been standard procedure to stop and board, arrest the crew and seize any contraband on board.",
      "\"Interdiction doesn't work,\" Rubio said Wednesday. \"Instead of interdicting it, on the president's orders, we blew it up. And it'll happen again. Maybe it's happening right now, I don't know, but the point is the president of the United States is going to wage war on narco-terrorist organizations.\"",
      "Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth said on Wednesday that U.S. military assets will remain in the region, and that more strikes may be forthcoming.",
      "\"This is a deadly, serious mission for us and it won't stop with just this strike,\" Hegseth told Fox News. \"Anyone else trafficking in those waters who we know is a designated narco-terrorist will face the same fate.\"",
      "The strike got a mixed reaction from leaders around Latin America, where the U.S. history of military intervention and gunboat diplomacy is still fresh. Many, like officials in Mexico, were careful not to outright condemn the attack but stressed the importance of protecting national sovereignty and warning that expanded U.S. military involvement might actually backfire.",
      "Mexico Foreign Affairs Secretary Ram\u00f3n de la Fuente, speaking to reporters alongside Rubio, emphasized his country's preference for \"nonintervention, peaceful solution of conflicts.\"",
      "Ecuador has its own issues with narcotics trafficking and also has been looked to by the Trump administration as a possible destination to deport non-Ecuadorian migrants from the United States. U.S. officials have said they would like to secure an agreement with Ecuador that would have it accept such deportees, but the status of negotiations with Quito was not clear.",
      "Ecuador's president, Daniel Noboa, on Thursday thanked Rubio for the U.S. efforts to \"actually eliminate any terrorist threat.\" Before their meeting, Rubio had said on social media that the U.S. and Ecuador are \"aligned as key partners on ending illegal immigration and combatting transnational crime and terrorism.\"",
      "Surging violence since COVID-19 pandemic",
      "The latest U.N. World Drug Report says various countries in South America, including Colombia, Ecuador and Peru, reported larger cocaine seizures in 2022 than in 2021, but it does not give Venezuela the outsize role that the White House has in recent months.",
      "\"The impact of increased cocaine trafficking has been felt in Ecuador in particular, which has seen a wave of lethal violence in recent years linked to both local and transnational crime groups, most notably from Mexico and the Balkan countries,\" the report says.",
      "Violence has skyrocketed in Ecuador since the COVID-19 pandemic, as drug traffickers expanded operations in the country and took advantage of the nation's banana industry.",
      "The South American country is the world's largest exporter of bananas, shipping about 7.2 million tons a year by sea. Traffickers find containers filled with bananas the perfect vehicle to smuggle their product.",
      "In addition, cartels from Mexico, Colombia and the Balkans have settled in Ecuador because it uses the U.S. dollar and has weak laws and institutions, along with a network of long-established, ruthless gangs that are eager for work.",
      "Ecuador also gained prominence in the global cocaine trade after political changes in Colombia last decade. Coca bush fields in Colombia have been moving closer to the border with Ecuador due to the breakup of criminal groups after the 2016 demobilization of the rebel group Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, better known by its Spanish acronym FARC.",
      "Rubio is also visiting the Andean country to argue against its close ties and reliance on China.",
      "AFP  \n                  \n        contributed to this report.",

    "story": [
      "The death toll from the devastating earthquake that hit eastern Afghanistan jumped to at least 2,205 on Thursday, four days after the temblor toppled homes as people slept. Afghanistan's Taliban rulers said 3,640 more people were confirmed injured from the quake, which struck the country's Kunar and Nangarhar provinces at about 11:40 p.m. local time on Sunday night.",
      "Aid workers and first responders were still racing on Thursday to find any survivors, Taliban officials said.",
      "Amid the destruction and with help slow to reach many parts of heavily-impacted Kunar province, survivors have buried many of the dead in mass graves, in line with Islamic tradition that dictates quick burials.",
      "\"That is my daughter, the other is my sister. This grave is my brother's, and that one is my mother's and that is my father, along with my brother,\" Wazir, a 25-year-old resident, told Afghanistan's TOLO News network, pointing to a small row of fresh graves.",
      "The worst-hit villages are in remote parts of the province, and many roads have been blocked by landslides triggered by the temblor. On Wednesday, the Taliban administration's Ministry of Interior shared a video with CBS News showing police and first responders working to clear a path by moving large rocks with their bare hands.",
      "Some rescue workers have walked for miles to reach the affected areas.",
      "Some emergency crews have been flown in by helicopter, but in some affected villages, the rough terrain makes it impossible for helicopters to land, and the Taliban's Minister of Defense said it was sending commandos down by rope to help people.",
      "\"One team had to walk for over 12 miles to reach villages cut off by rock falls, carrying medical equipment on their backs with the help of community members,\" the Save The Children charity said in a statement.",
      "The United Nations' World Health Organization said Thursday that it was scaling up its emergency response in Afghanistan and warned that the number of dead and injured was still likely to rise over the coming days, as it is feared entire families have been buried under rubble and not yet accounted for.",
      "\"More than 6,782 homes have been destroyed in the earthquake, leaving thousands of people homeless and in harsh conditions. Hospitals are overwhelmed with the influx of severely injured patients, many in need of urgent surgery and critical medical care,\" the WHO said.",
      "The earthquake struck mountainous and remote parts of Afghanistan, and there have been significant aftershocks, driving many families to sleep out in the open and far from their homes, most of which were not built to withstand earthquakes despite the region being prone to seismic activity.",
      "The disaster struck as Afghanistan was already struggling through a humanitarian crisis.",
      "The Afghan government, along with international aid organizations, have launched an appeal for donations to help the survivors. According to the Norwegian Refugee Council, local resources in Kunar have been stretched to breaking point.",
      "\"Communities in the valleys have lost almost everything \u2014 their families, homes, livestock, and vital water channels. In the aftermath, makeshift camps are sheltering 50 to 100 women and children per tent, with no access to proper wash facilities,\" the charity said in a statement. \"Families with children are deeply traumatized, with some children having been trapped under rubble for several hours before being rescued.\"",
      "The Taliban's official spokesman shared several bank account numbers seeking private donations, saying any funds would go to help those in need. On Wednesday, Minister of Foreign Affairs Amir Khan Mutaqi called on the country's diplomats abroad to seek aid from their host nation's governments, charitable organizations, and well-wishers.",
      "Suhail Shaheen, the Taliban's ambassador in Qatar, told CBS News the Foreign Minister had instructed Afghan envoys to open condolence books at embassies and to explain the situation and the urgent needs of the quake victims.",
      "\"We have given details of the situation on ground; the rest is for the others to decide about their assistance.\" Shaheen told CBS News.",
      "A number of countries have come forward to offer aid funding, but given the extent of the damage, much more will likely be needed.",
      "The fact that many foreign powers, including the U.S. and most other Western nations, have refused to recognize the Taliban as Afghanistan's legitimate government since it retook control in 2021 will make securing the needed emergency funding more difficult, according to analysts.",
      "\"The earthquake is another reminder that the people of Afghanistan suffer from not having a government recognized at the U.N. A number of international aid mechanisms such as World Bank financing would (otherwise) have activated to support the vulnerable,\" Torek Farhadi, an analyst, development economist and former senior advisor at the IMF, told CBS News.",

      "The French presidency shared a video of the meeting on social media that showed Witkoff at the table, and shaking hands and greeting Zelenskyy with a hug. Ukrainian presidential press secretary Serhii Nikiforov Zelenskyy told the AFP that Zelenskyy and Witkoff also held a closed-door meeting.",
      "Witkoff was invited to participate in the so-called \"coalition of the willing\" meeting to discuss aid for Ukraine, including sketching out plans for military support in the event of a ceasefire in the Russia-Ukraine war, to deter future Russian aggression, officials told AFP.",

      "Starmer's office said after the meeting in Paris on Thursday that the British prime minister had \"emphasized that the group had an unbreakable pledge to Ukraine, with President Trump's backing, and it was clear they now needed to go even further to apply pressure on (Russian president Vladimir) Putin to secure a cessation of hostilities.\"",
      "While Ukraine has agreed to a proposal by the Trump administration for an immediate ceasefire, Putin has yet to even agree to meet with Zelenskyy on neutral ground, instead suggesting he come to Moscow. Despite Mr. Trump's mounting criticism, Putin has continued pressing his gains in Ukraine, and continued attacking not only military targets, but civilian infrastructure, with devastating effects.",

      "\"We Europeans are ready to provide security guarantees to Ukraine and the Ukrainians on the day peace is signed,\" Macron said.",
      "It is unclear what members of the coalition are willing to contribute, including troops on the ground.",

    "story": [
      "China's President Xi Jinping and his visiting Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin discussed life-prolonging organ transplants and immortality as they chatted before a massive military parade in Beijing on Wednesday, in comments picked up by state media microphones.",
      "Historic images showed Xi shaking hands and speaking with Putin and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un as they walked down a red carpet by Tiananmen Square, in scenes viewed as a challenge to President Trump and the U.S.-led global order that has prevailed for more than a century.",
      "\"These days ... 70 years old,\" Xi mused in Mandarin as he walked beside Putin and Kim, according to video aired by Chinese state broadcaster CCTV. Xi's translator conveyed the remarks to Putin, who is then heard in Russian quoting a line from a Tang dynasty poem: \"In the past, it used to be rare for someone to be older than 70 and these days they say that at 70 one's still a child.\"",
      "Putin then turned toward Xi, speaking while gesturing with his hands, though his words are inaudible on the CCTV feed. The same Chinese translator then relays Putin's remarks to Xi.",
      "\"With the ... development of biotechnology, human organs can be continuously transplanted, people could get younger as they grow older, and may even become immortal,\" Putin said, according to the translator.",
      "Xi then spoke again in Mandarin as the camera cut away: \"Predictions are, in this century, it may be ... possible to live to 150 years old.\"",
      "Putin confirmed the exchange during a news conference later Wednesday.",
      "\"Ah, I think it was when we were going to the parade that the chairman spoke about this,\" he told reporters, referring to Xi.",
      "\"Modern means \u2014 both health improvement and medical means, and then even all kinds of surgical ones related to organ replacement \u2014 allow humanity to hope that active life will continue not as it does today,\" Putin added.",
      "Xi and Putin, along with Kim and Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, have been dubbed an \"Axis of Upheaval\" by some Western analysts, and Xi's decision to bring together the leaders of some of the most heavily sanctioned nations in the world this week was clearly calculated.",
      "The parade was the first time Kim had ever appeared together with both Xi and Putin \u2014 providing him a first multilateral diplomatic event.",
      "Xi and Putin have made their ambition to shake up the global status quo clear for several years.",

      "China and Russia have declared a \"no limits partnership,\" and neither Xi nor Putin, who are both 72, has ever expressed any intention of stepping down from their respective roles at the helm of their nations.",
      "While Xi's predecessors Jiang Zemin and Hu Jintao relinquished power after 10 years in office, he abolished term limits in 2018 and, in 2023, was handed a third term as Chinese president.",
      "Putin was elected to a record fifth six-year term just last year in Russia. Critics dismissed the vote as a patently undemocratic farse, as virtually all of Putin's serious political opponents were barred from running, and many of them were jailed.",
      "Putin has twice used his leverage as Russia's autocratic leader to amend the constitution so that he can theoretically stay in power until he's in his mid-80s. He already is the longest-serving Kremlin leader since Soviet dictator Josef Stalin.",
      "China, meanwhile, has historically had one of the lowest rates of organ donation in the world, with a severe shortage of organ donors and a long-standing black-market organ trade. In 2016, about four years into Xi's tenure as leader, surgeons from the World Health Organization gathered in Beijing to try to allay skepticism about whether Chinese hospitals had, as claimed, stopped performing transplants with the organs of executed prisoners.",

    "story": [
      "The United States will keep assets positioned in the Caribbean and strike anyone \"trafficking in those waters who we know is a designated narco terrorist,\" Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth said Wednesday morning, a day after President Trump said the U.S. military had attacked and destroyed a drug-carrying vessel in the region.",
      "Mr. Trump said Tuesday that the U.S. had struck the boat\u00a0in international waters after it had departed from Venezuela. The president later\u00a0said on Truth Social\u00a0that 11 people were killed in the strike. He said the attack targeted members of\u00a0Tren de Aragua, a Venezuela-based organized crime group that has been\u00a0designated\u00a0as a foreign terrorist organization by the Trump administration.",
      "Mr. Trump also posted a video that appeared to show a military strike obliterating a small boat in the open sea.",
      "Hegseth told \"Fox & Friends\" on Wednesday morning that he watched the strike live. He said the video was \"definitely not artificial intelligence,\" as Venezuela's Communications Minister Freddy \u00d1\u00e1\u00f1ez claimed in a post on social media. Hegseth said that he could not elaborate on how the operation had been carried out, but said it was a \"precision\" attack.",
      "\"We knew exactly who was in that boat, we knew exactly what they were doing, and we knew exactly who they represented, and that was Tren de Aragua ... trying to poison our country with illicit drugs,\" Hegseth said.",
      "Hegseth did not say how the government identified the boat or those aboard it. Secretary of State Marco Rubio told reporters on Tuesday that he believed the drugs were headed toward Trinidad and Tobago or another country in the Caribbean. Kamla Persad-Bissessar, the prime minister of Trinidad and Tobago, praised the strike in a statement issued late Tuesday, The Associated Press reported.",
      "Hegseth said Wednesday that the strike shows that \"President Trump is willing to go on offense in ways that others have not been\" when dealing with drug smugglers.",
      "\"You want to try to traffic drugs, it's a new day,\" the defense secretary said. \"It's a different day, and so those 11 drug traffickers are no longer with us, sending a very clear signal that this is an activity the United States is not going to tolerate in our hemisphere.\"",
      "Hegseth said that assets will remain in the region, and that further strikes may be forthcoming.",
      "\"This is a deadly, serious mission for us and it won't stop with just this strike,\" he said. \"Anyone else trafficking in those waters who we know is a designated narco-terrorist will face the same fate.\"",
      "Mr. Trump\u00a0directed the military\u00a0to target drug cartels in Latin America last month. In August, the U.S. said the Navy would increase its presence near Venezuela and deploy multiple warships as part of an anti-drug cartel mission. Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro\u00a0called the move\u00a0an \"extravagant, unjustifiable, immoral and absolutely criminal and bloody threat.\" Maduro responded by deploying\u00a0warships and drones to Venezuela's coastline.",
      "The U.S. has not indicated it plans to strike Venezuela directly. When Hegseth was asked Wednesday by Fox News about the possibility of a regime change in the country, he said it was a \"presidential decision.\" The Trump administration has\u00a0accused Maduro's government\u00a0of working with drug cartels and groups like Tren de Aragua to bring illicit substances into the United States.",
      "A U.S. federal court charged Maduro\u00a0with narco-terrorism and drug trafficking\u00a0in 2020, allegations that Maduro has denied. The U.S. is offering a $50 million\u00a0reward for Maduro's arrest.",
      "\"What we have, there in the Caribbean, is clear demonstration of military might,\" Hegseth said in the \"Fox & Friends\" interview. \"President Trump has shown whether it is southwest border, Houthis, (Operation) Midnight Hammer in Iran, precise power could impact and reshape dynamics around the world and in the region. Nicolas Maduro, as he considers whether to be a narco-trafficker, has decisions to make.\"",

      "The most recent data from 2020 says at least 20 planes make up the executive fleet. A newly constructed plane has not been added in nearly 27 years. Some of those currently in service are expected to stay flying for another 13 years.",
      "\"They're not building the plane fast enough. I mean, they're actually in default,\" Trump said about Boeing in a February interview with Sean Hannity.",
      "Air Force One is used to designate any Air Force aircraft carrying the commander in chief. There are currently two highly customized Boeing aircraft that were deployed in 1990 when George H.W. Bush was president. The planes have since carried presidents Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, Barack Obama, Trump, Joe Biden and now Trump once again.",

It was one of the prince's planes, which I think they were trying to sell. And now they're giving it to the U.S., and it's costing quite a bit to update,\" Jay Solomon, a staff writer for the Free Press, said.",
      "The Qatari jet is estimated to have a faster timeline than the two Boeing planes, but it still needs some of the same technology to make it Air Force One.",
      "\"If you look at it just through economics, maybe it makes sense, but I still think the fact that we're allowing a foreign country to gift something of that magnitude to a sitting president \u2014 on top of all these other concerns \u2014 I think it's a risk, and it's not a good look,\" Soloman said.",
      "Air Force One is required to have four engines, unlike most of today\u2019s passenger planes, which have two. Onboard is the highest level of classified communications and external protection against foreign surveillance. The planes are equipped with air-to-air refueling capabilities so they can fly for as long as needed. Air Force One is built for the worst possible scenarios, like nuclear war, so that the president can still command military forces from the sky.",
      "\"They're extremely complex, and I'm not going to go into it, but they're not like a normal plane. You know, it's not like building a 747 normal,\" Trump said during his Middle East Trip on \"Special Report\" in May.",

The Air Force is studying potential replacement options, but the current planes will continue to fly until 2038. The aircraft are primarily used by the vice president, Cabinet members, members of Congress and other officials.",

Again, can't talk in detail about that, but that is always a consideration,\" Air Force Secretary Troy Meink said during a June Senate Hearing.",

      "Fox News got exclusive access to the team responsible for locating the tens of thousands of unaccompanied children who crossed the border and disappeared into the system under the Biden administration.",
      "Under the Trump administration, 22,638 unaccompanied children have been located so far, and more than 400 sponsors have been arrested. Twenty-seven of the minors were found dead, either by murder, suicide or drug overdose, according to the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS.)",
      "\"It's important that we find these cases where children are being used for labor and sexually trafficked,\" John Fabbricatore, HHS Office of Refugee Resettlement senior advisor, said.",
      "The team was assembled in March to fulfill one of President Donald Trump's campaign promises. He tasked border czar Tom Homan with finding the unaccounted for children, many of whom had been released to unvetted sponsors or non-family members, leaving them vulnerable to exploitation, trafficking and harsh working conditions.",

      "According to Fabbricatore, many of the minors the team was able to locate were found in deplorable conditions and exploited.",
      "\"We found children who have been raped,\" he said. \"We're talking about debt bondage, where children are being made to work off debt, trafficking debt. We're talking about children that were brought into situations and then treated like sexual slaves. You know, where children are in horrific environments, just environments that they should not be in, where the sponsor is a heroin dealer and that child winds up dying of a heroin overdose.\"",
      "In early 2021, a record number of\u00a0children started crossing the border faster than HHS could process.\u00a0Between January 2021 and December 2024, ORR received more than 470,000 referrals of unaccompanied alien children who crossed the border.",
      "According to HHS, many of those children were released to sponsors under very lax vetting policies that failed to ensure child safety or prevent multiple instances of child endangerment, including neglect, labor exploitation, trafficking and sexual and physical abuse.",

      "\"There wasn't very good recordkeeping\" under the Biden administration, Fabbricatore said. \"It's drawing that data back in, being able to identify addresses, where these children went, who these sponsors actually were. In many cases, that data is, is horrible. What the Biden administration was taking in and putting into our computer systems was not the right information. So now we have to draw that all back in and deeply investigate into where some of these children went.\"",
      "According to Fabbricatore, the most concerning lapse in screening was the failure to conduct DNA tests to confirm that children were being released to their actual family members.",
      "The Trump administration took steps to improve the vetting process for children who arrive in the U.S. alone, ensuring that sponsors \u2013 usually parents or guardians \u2013 are properly screened. These measures include requiring DNA testing, proof of income to demonstrate the ability to care for the child, criminal background checks, fingerprinting and identification verification.",
      "\"So now, under this administration, we are making sure that we know there's a real familial connection through DNA, and we are not releasing these children unless we have the right information,\" Fabbricatore said. \"Children are staying in custody longer, but there's a reason for that, because we want to ensure that these children remain safe.\"",
      "When the Trump administration took office, there was a backlog of over 65,000 unaddressed post-release reports, called Notifications of Concern, according to ORR. These internal reports relate to unaccompanied alien children and include allegations ranging from administrative issues to potential trafficking and criminal exploitation.",

And if we can prove that they're safer in the country, that they're going back to, that is where they should be with their parents.\"",

      "\"He eventually realized he couldn't control the bleeding and made his way back to the engine,\" Kleiman recalls.\u00a0\"The crew noted that he was pale and sweaty and that his turnout gear was saturated in blood. Traditional methods failed, so they administered TRAUMAGEL. It instantly stopped the bleeding.\"",

    "story": [
      "If you are struggling with a slow Wi-Fi or internet connection, follow Kurt \"The CyberGuy\" Knutsson's instructions to solve these issues.",
      "Home Wi-Fi networks are the backbone of how most people get online, connecting laptops, phones, smart TVs and more. When properly secured, they offer a convenient and private way to browse the internet, stream content and work from home. But \"private\" doesn't always mean \"safe.\" Wi-Fi security can be easily compromised if you have weak settings or outdated equipment.",
      "I recently heard from Carol in Smithtown, New York, who asked, \"Is it safe to browse the internet on your own laptop using only your home Wi-Fi?\"",
      "Her question points to a bigger concern. Many of us rely on home networks every day without really knowing if they're as secure as they should be.",
      "Let's break down what makes a home Wi-Fi network secure, the risks you should know about and the steps you can take to protect your privacy.",
      "Sign up for my FREE CyberGuy ReportGet my best tech tips, urgent security alerts and exclusive deals delivered straight to your inbox. Plus, you\u2019ll get instant access to my Ultimate Scam Survival Guide \u2014 free when you join my\u00a0Cyberguy.com newsletter.",
      "A user troubleshoots an internet router. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Why home Wi-Fi security is important",
      "Your home Wi-Fi is not just a way to get online but also the gateway to your personal and professional life. Everything from online banking to work emails to video calls passes through it. If your network isn't secure, that information could be intercepted or exposed.",
      "One of the biggest misconceptions is that a home network is safe simply because it's private. In reality, hackers often target residential networks because they tend to have weaker defenses than corporate ones.",
      "Someone nearby could connect to your network if your password is weak or your encryption is outdated. This not only slows your internet but also lets them use your connection for illegal activities. Sensitive information like passwords, credit card numbers and personal documents can be intercepted if the network is compromised.",
      "11 EASY WAYS TO PROTECT YOUR ONLINE PRIVACY IN 2025",
      "Attackers can use an insecure network to push malicious software onto your devices, sometimes without you even realizing it. Smart devices such as security cameras, thermostats and speakers can be taken over and used for spying or as part of larger cyberattacks.",
      "Even if you trust everyone in your household, your network is still exposed to risks from outside. And with so many devices connected today, including laptops, phones, tablets, TVs and IoT gadgets, there are more entry points for an attacker than ever before. Securing your Wi-Fi closes those doors before someone decides to try them.",
      "A hacker executes cybercrime. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Choose the right router for Wi-Fi protection",
      "Every piece of Wi-Fi security advice ultimately comes back to the same foundation: your router. It is the gatekeeper for your entire home network. If it is old, poorly configured, or missing important updates, even the strongest passwords and best digital habits will not fully protect you.",
      "Investing in a good router is one of the most important steps you can take to secure your home Wi-Fi. A modern, well-supported router gives you stronger encryption, better control over connected devices and regular updates that patch security flaws.",
      "Don't stop at the hardware itself. Check regularly for firmware updates from the manufacturer. Some new routers update automatically, but many require you to log in and install patches manually. Outdated firmware leaves known vulnerabilities wide open.",
      "IS YOUR HOME WI-FI REALLY SAFE? THINK AGAIN",
      "Also, change the default router login password immediately. Most routers ship with basic credentials like \"admin/admin.\" Attackers know this and can easily hijack your settings if you never change them.",
      "If your router supports it, enable\u00a0two-factor authentication (2FA)\u00a0for logins. This extra step makes it much harder for attackers to gain control, even if they steal your password.",
      "If you are not sure where to begin, I have put together a list of some of the best and most secure routers you can buy right now by visiting\u00a0Cyberguy.com.",
      "Enable strong Wi-Fi encryption",
      "Encryption ensures that the data flowing across your network is scrambled, making it useless to anyone who tries to intercept it. Without proper encryption, nearby attackers can capture and read your traffic.",
      "The current gold standard is WPA3, which provides the strongest protection. If your router doesn't support it, WPA2 is still considered safe and widely used. Older options like WEP or an open, password-free network are highly insecure and should be avoided at all costs. It's worth logging into your router's settings just to confirm what level of encryption your network is using.",
      "Cables run out of an internet router. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Create a strong Wi-Fi password",
      "Your Wi-Fi password is the digital equivalent of the key to your home. A short or predictable password is like leaving a spare under the doormat, and anyone determined enough can find a way in. Instead, create a long passphrase that combines upper and lowercase letters, numbers and symbols. Aim for at least 12 to 16 characters.",
      "Consider using a password manager to generate and store complex passwords.",
      "Check out the best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 at\u00a0Cyberguy.com.",
      "Check who is connected to your network",
      "Even with a solid password, it's smart to check who is actually connected to your network. Most routers allow you to view a list of active devices. If you spot something you don't recognize, investigate. It could be a neighbor piggybacking on your connection or, in the worst case, an intruder.",
      "It also helps to disable Wi-Fi Protected Setup (WPS). This feature was designed to make connecting new devices easier, but it has security flaws that attackers can exploit. Some users go further by enabling MAC address filtering, which limits access to specific devices.",
      "To reduce risk even more, set up a\u00a0separate guest network for smart devices and visitors. That way, if one device gets hacked, your laptops and phones remain protected.",
      "And remember, keep all your devices updated. From laptops and phones to smart bulbs and thermostats, every gadget is a potential entry point. A weak link in one device can put your entire network at risk.",
      "IS YOUR PHONE HACKED? HOW TO TELL AND WHAT TO DO",
      "Protect your privacy with a VPN",
      "A Virtual Private Network, or VPN, helps solve one of the biggest issues with online privacy, which is who can see what you're doing. When you connect through a VPN, it creates an encrypted tunnel between your device and the websites or apps you use. Everything that travels through this tunnel is hidden from outsiders, including your internet provider.",
      "A reliable VPN is essential for protecting your online privacy and ensuring a secure, high-speed connection.",
      "For the best VPN software, see my expert review of the best VPNs for browsing the web privately on your\u00a0Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices at\u00a0Cyberguy.com.",
      "Don't overlook antivirus protection",
      "While your Wi-Fi settings form the first line of defense, you should also protect the devices connected to your network. Install strong antivirus software to block malware that could spread through downloads, emails, or malicious links. This extra step ensures that even if a threat slips past your router's defenses, your devices stay protected.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",

      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "So, to return to Carol's question: Is it safe to browse the internet on your home Wi-Fi? The answer is yes, but only if you take the time to secure it. Strong router settings, proper encryption and a solid password do most of the heavy lifting. Building habits such as checking who is connected, keeping devices updated and using tools like a VPN adds even greater peace of mind.",

Unlike expensive satellites or large drones such as the Global Hawk, Skydweller offers commanders a cheaper option for persistent monitoring. It can hover over an area in what experts call a \"pseudo-satellite role,\" freeing up more advanced systems for priority missions.",
      "For U.S. Southern Command, Skydweller could help track drug trafficking, border security threats and other maritime challenges. Longer tests are already planned for this summer in the SOUTHCOM region, which covers Latin America and the Caribbean and oversees U.S. military operations in that area.",

      "Future of solar-powered flight for Navy missions",
      "While Skydweller has already logged nearly 220 flight hours, engineers believe it could stay airborne far longer. Weather and range limits kept this recent test at 73 hours, but in theory, the aircraft could remain aloft for weeks.",
      "The Department of Defense sees platforms like Skydweller as vital for future conflicts where fuel resupply may not be possible. Renewable-powered drones could solve logistics headaches, especially in contested environments, which essentially means operating in places where enemies can block supply lines and make traditional refueling too risky.",
      "What this means for you",
      "The Navy's solar drone test is proof that renewable energy can support technologies once thought impossible.

      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice.\u00a0 They aren\u2019t cheap, and neither is your privacy.\u00a0 These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites.\u00a0 It\u2019s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.\u00a0 By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",

      "When you change your address, always use the official USPS website or your local post office. Some third-party sites look like they're offering a convenient service, but they often collect extra data about you and sometimes even resell it. Going straight to the source means your sensitive details don't take unnecessary detours.",
      "When you sell your home, more than just the price gets published. Your name, past addresses and even photos of your home can become part of the public record. Ask your realtor what's automatically disclosed and whether anything can be limited or redacted. It's worth being picky here: the less of your personal footprint that's tied to your property, the better.",
      "Moving is the perfect excuse to purge. But don't just throw out old bills, medical statements, or financial records; shred them. Dumpster-diving for personal data may sound outdated, but it's still a method scammers use. A good shredder ensures your sensitive history doesn't end up in the wrong hands.",
      "It's tempting to post a \"Goodbye, old house!\" photo online, but resist the urge. Publicly announcing a move tells scammers exactly when your home is empty and what your new address might be. Instead, share the news directly with family and close friends. A little less buzz online means a lot more safety offline.",
      "One powerful way to stay ahead of scammers is to freeze your credit. A freeze blocks new credit accounts from being opened in your name, even if criminals have your address or other details. The good news is that you can do this for free with all three major credit bureaus: Equifax, Experian and TransUnion.",
      "It only takes a few minutes online or by phone, and you can lift the freeze anytime if you need to apply for a loan or credit card. By freezing your credit before and after your move, you create a strong barrier that keeps thieves from turning stolen data into financial damage.",

      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Moving should feel like a new beginning, not an invitation for scammers to strike. With a few smart steps, you can stay ahead of data brokers and fraudsters. From shredding documents to freezing your credit, every action adds a layer of protection. By protecting your information before and after your move, you gain peace of mind and start your next chapter on solid ground. The effort is small compared to the security it brings.",

      "PlusAI reports that its driverless trucks could be ready to hit the road within the next two years. (PlusAI)",
      "Why PlusAI's 2025 results matter for autonomous trucks",
      "Even if you never step into a truck, these results affect your daily life. Every product you buy travels by truck at some point, whether it's groceries, clothing or furniture. The way those trucks operate influences cost, availability and safety on the road.",
      "The trucking industry faces three major challenges. There are not enough long-haul drivers to meet demand. Costs continue to rise due to labor shortages, tariffs and fuel prices. And safety is a concern because human drivers can get tired or distracted.",
      "Autonomous trucks could help address each of these issues. PlusAI's vehicles are already hauling freight on Texas highways today, and they are also undergoing road testing in Sweden. The company has already logged more than 5 million autonomous miles across the United States, Europe and Asia. That real-world experience fuels the AI system with the data it needs to improve.",
      "LUCID JOINS TESLA AND GM WITH HANDS-FREE HIGHWAY DRIVING",
      "The PlusAI Safety Case Framework. Data shows that self-driving trucks will roll out by 2027. (PlusAI)",
      "How PlusAI plans to launch autonomous trucks by 2027",
      "PlusAI has created a roadmap that sets it apart. Instead of retrofitting trucks with autonomous systems, it is working with major manufacturers like TRATON GROUP, Hyundai and IVECO to integrate the technology at the factory. This approach makes scaling production faster and ensures consistency.",
      "The initial launch is planned for the Texas Triangle, a major freight corridor connecting Dallas, Houston, San Antonio and Austin. From there, PlusAI plans to expand into other U.S. routes and eventually Europe.",
      "The company has also committed to publishing regular performance updates as it transitions to a public company. By sharing measurable results, PlusAI builds trust with regulators, the public, and businesses that may one day rely on its trucks to move goods.",

      "PlusAI still has milestones to meet. Safety readiness must rise from 86% to 100%. Remote Assistance Free Trips must surpass 90%. These are ambitious goals, but the progress so far suggests the company can achieve them.",

    "story": [
      "The CyberGuy explains steps you can take to protect yourself from scams.",
      "Forget roaring lawnmowers and fuel-guzzling tractors. Today's solar companies are turning to flocks of sheep to trim grass and control weeds under solar panels. These eco-friendly grazers easily navigate narrow panel rows, cutting maintenance costs and carbon emissions at the same time. In fact, using sheep instead of gas-powered mowing crews can reduce upkeep expenses by up to 20 percent.",

      "WHY AI IS CAUSING SUMMER ELECTRICITY BILLS TO SOAR",
      "Why solar grazing with sheep cuts costs and emissions",
      "Sheep fit neatly between solar arrays, reaching into nooks that mechanical gear can't. They chew rain or shine. And since sheep run on grass, not gas, their grazing helps reduce carbon emissions. Using these natural lawnmowers better aligns with solar's green mission goals. Developers like SB Energy in Texas now rely on herds of around 3,000 sheep to cover thousands of acres, benefiting both their bottom line and the planet.",
      "WHY YOU SHOULD THINK TWICE BEFORE JOINING A POWER SAVER PROGRAM",
      "Sheep graze near solar panels in Haskell, Texas, Dec. 2, 2024.\u00a0 (REUTERS/Annie Rice)",
      "How agrivoltaics turns sheep and solar panels into profits",
      "This isn't your average landscaping story. There's even a fancy word for it: agrivolatics, or the practice of combining solar energy production with agriculture.\u2028Farmers who jump on board aren't just maintaining the lawn; they're opening up multiple revenue streams. First, ranchers can lease land to solar companies, sign grazing contracts, while still earning from traditional farm products like wool and lamb.",
      "Chad Raines is a rancher from Texas. He decided to trade in cotton farming for sheep grazing on solar land. That move has paid off. Last year, he brought in around $300,000. If he had stuck with cotton, he estimates he would've lost about $200,000 instead. That's a huge swing, and it's a real-world example of how solar grazing is helping revive a sheep industry that had been stuck in neutral for decades.",
      "How sheep improve soil health and boost biodiversity at solar farms",
      "Letting sheep do the mowing isn't just about saving time or money. It actually helps the land. As they move through the fields, sheep naturally break down plant material, aerate the soil and leave behind fertilizing manure. This leads to healthier dirt and better carbon capture.",
      "Companies like Lightsource BP are already seeing those benefits. They manage over 14,000 sheep across solar farms that produce more than 3 gigawatts of power. These sites aren't just power generators, they're also habitats. Flowers that support bees and butterflies are planted among the panels, creating ideal conditions for pollinators. Some farms have even started producing honey thanks to the thriving bee population.",
      "GOOGLE TURNS CO2 INTO BATTERY POWER FOR CLEAN ENERGY",
      "Sheep grazing cuts operations and maintenance costs for solar operators. (REUTERS/Annie Rice)",
      "Major solar farms scale up sheep grazing across thousands of acres",
      "This isn't just happening on a small scale. Enel North America recently signed one of the biggest solar grazing deals in the country. They're deploying over 6,000 sheep across eight large solar farms, covering more than 10,000 acres.",
      "At some of those sites, the amount of organic matter in the soil has more than doubled. For solar operators, this approach just makes sense. It cuts operations and maintenance costs, strengthens environmental credibility and builds better relationships with nearby communities.",
      "Investors are paying attention, too. In just two years, the number of solar grazing projects has skyrocketed, especially in places backed by heavy hitters like DE Shaw and Berkshire Hathaway.",
      "Chad Raines opens the gate to a solar panel zone in Haskell, Texas, Dec. 2, 2024. This solar farm has six different solar panel zones on 1,800 acres of land.\u00a0 (REUTERS/Annie Rice)",
      "What solar grazing means for you",
      "If you care about clean energy, sustainable farming or smart land use, solar grazing is worth watching. It shows how innovation doesn't always require high-tech gadgets; sometimes, it just takes some sheep. For farmers and ranchers, this model opens the door to new income by partnering with solar companies. If you own land or work in agriculture, grazing contracts could provide a steady stream of revenue without giving up traditional operations.",
      "For everyone else, this trend offers hope that renewable energy can coexist with rural livelihoods, boost biodiversity and fight climate change, all at once. As solar farms expand across the country, expect to see more flocks doing the work of machines, quietly transforming how we power the planet.",

      "DON'T FALL FOR THIS BANK PHISHING SCAM TRICK",
      "Scammers impersonating local authorities are on the rise, telling victims they missed jury duty and must pay to avoid legal trouble. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What jury duty scam victims need to know",
      "Scammers posing as court officials are targeting individuals with false claims about missed jury duty, prompting warnings from law enforcement. The fraud typically begins with a call from a blocked or unknown number, alleging that the recipient has missed jury duty and is facing an arrest warrant. The scammers then demand payment, usually through wire transfers or gift cards.",
      "A key warning sign is being asked to pay money to avoid arrest or legal trouble. It is important never to give money or personal information to unknown callers.",
      "These scams often target older or more vulnerable individuals, although younger people have also reported close calls. In one example, a person received repeated calls from an unidentified number before answering. The caller, claiming to be from a local sheriff's department and equipped with the individual's full name and address, insisted they had failed to appear for jury duty and faced multiple citations.",

      "If you get a suspicious call about missed jury duty, don't panic. Follow these steps to stay safe and protect your personal information.",
      "This might sound obvious, but don't trust any unknown caller, especially if they demand money. Legitimate authorities will never ask for payment over the phone, especially not through gift cards, wire transfers, or cryptocurrency. If someone threatens you with arrest or legal action unless you pay immediately, it's almost certainly a scam. Hang up and call your local court or police department using an official number.",
      "If you receive a suspicious call, take a breath and fact-check. Court summonses are always delivered by mail, not over the phone. Even if the caller has personal information like your name or address, that doesn't make them credible. Scammers often use leaked or publicly available data to appear convincing.",
      "Be extra cautious, even if the scam comes through text messages or email. Do not click on any suspicious links, as they can install malware on your device and steal your personal data.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",

Investing in a data removal service can help reduce your digital footprint by scrubbing your information from people-search sites and data brokers.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren't cheap, and neither is your privacy. These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It's what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet. By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",

      "What this means for you",
      "Scammers are getting bolder and more convincing, but you can stay a step ahead.

      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "Instead of relying on faceless phishing emails, scammers are now using hyper-personalized and emotionally charged phone calls. By impersonating local authorities and referencing civic duties like jury duty, they exploit both fear and a sense of responsibility. What makes this especially dangerous is how plausible it sounds, drawing on real processes that many people don't fully understand.",

      "Honeywell Aerospace's \"Surface Alert System,\" or \"SURF-A,\" can detect when a rogue aircraft gets in the way of another plane that has been cleared for takeoff or landing. The system gives pilots two aural alerts when an unauthorized aircraft enters the runway on a collision course with the authorized aircraft. The first alert sounds 30 seconds before a collision, and the second alert sounds 15 seconds before a collision.",
      "\"It sounds like such a small amount of time, but things happen so rapidly, and 15 to 30 seconds is actually a very, very large margin when you're moving at the speeds that we're moving in an aircraft like this,\" Honeywell test pilot Doug Rybczynski said.",

      "The Honeywell crew flew from the Kansas City Downtown airport in Missouri to Topeka, Kansas. On Test Flight 757's approach to Topeka, a Honeywell crew member parked a smaller Gulfstream aircraft at the end of the runway, triggering the SURF-A alert system. After hearing both alerts, the pilot performed a \"go-around\" maneuver.",
      "The demonstration simulated a 2023 close call at the Austin-Bergstrom International Airport in Austin, Texas. In that scenario, a FedEx B767 was cleared to land in poor conditions. As the FedEx plane got closer, the pilots noticed a Southwest Airlines B737 lined up on the runway below them. The FedEx pilots were able to perform a last-second go-around maneuver to avoid a collision, but Honeywell says the SURF-A system, which wasn't around at the time, would have given the pilots an additional 28 seconds of notice.",

      "Honeywell started developing the SURF-A system in 2020 when the aviation industry noticed more close calls happening on runways. Using \"ADS-B\" Out technology, a GPS system that makes an airplane's position known to other pilots, engineers were able to determine the trajectory of planes that are on a collision course.",

Companies market them as\u00a0\"screen-free playmates\" for toddlers, but pediatric experts warn these toys could trade human connection for machine conversation.

      "AI-powered stuffed toys, such as Grem (left), could disrupt cognitive and emotional development among young children, experts say. (Curio/\u00a9Michael Cuviello/Amarillo Globe-News/USA Today Network/IMAGN)",
      "Why AI stuffed animals worry child experts",
      "Pediatricians and psychologists raise red flags about these AI toys. Young children naturally form attachments. If those attachments shift to chatbots, kids may learn to trust machines more than people. Research already shows children ages 3 to 6 sometimes trust robots more than humans, even when the robots give wrong answers. That undermines how kids build empathy, learn to question, and develop critical thinking. There are also privacy concerns. Parents may not realize that these\u00a0\"personalized\" toys are recording conversations. Sensitive information could be stored, analyzed, or misused without families fully knowing.",

      "How AI toys may disrupt child development",
      "Pediatric experts in early childhood and language development warn that responsive AI could\u00a0\"fundamentally change the wiring of the human brain.\" Unlike television or passive media, AI plushies respond in real time, adapting to a child's questions, stories, and moods. That responsiveness can be powerful. It can encourage curiosity, vocabulary growth, and even creativity. But it can also crowd out human interactions, those subtle facial expressions, pauses, and \"nos\" that children need to experience to learn empathy and resilience. Another risk is that AI companions are trained to be overly charming and agreeable. Instead of challenging a child's thinking, these\u00a0\"sycophantic\" toys may simply tell kids what they want to hear. Over time, that could nudge children toward believing comforting lies instead of asking hard questions, a toxic pattern for developing critical thinking.",

In fact, some early research shows kids learn new words faster when engaging in dialogue with AI rather than passively consuming media. But the tradeoff is significant. If AI becomes the primary companion, kids could miss out on the messy, unpredictable, and deeply human experiences that shape trust, empathy, and social awareness.",

      "SCAMMERS ARE USING DOCUSIGN EMAILS TO PUSH APPLE PAY FRAUD",
      "Hackers stole 13 million records, exposing data of 4.4 million Americans in the latest TransUnion cyberattack. (Christopher Dilts/Bloomberg)",
      "What you need to know about the TransUnion data breach",
      "TransUnion has disclosed a major data breach that impacted 4,461,511 individuals in the United States, according to a filing with the Maine Attorney General's Office. The incident occurred on July 28, 2025, and was discovered two days later on July 30.",
      "The breach resulted from unauthorized access to a third-party application used in TransUnion's U.S. consumer support operations. The company stressed that its core credit database and credit reports were not compromised.",
      "Although TransUnion characterized the exposed information as \"limited,\" the stolen data is highly sensitive. It includes names, dates of birth, Social Security numbers, billing addresses, email addresses, phone numbers, reasons for customer transactions (such as requests for a free credit report), and customer support tickets and messages.",
      "Hackers claim they stole more than 13 million records in total, with about 4.4 million tied to U.S. consumers.",
      "In response, TransUnion is providing all affected individuals with 24 months of free credit monitoring and identity theft protection services.",
      "FARMERS INSURANCE DATA BREACH EXPOSES 1.1M AMERICANS",
      "The breach at TransUnion follows several similar cyberattacks against tech companies, including Google and Cisco, and retail brands, such as Chanel and Adidas.\u00a0 (Mike Kemp/In Pictures)",
      "Hackers target companies through Salesforce apps",
      "The breach appears to be part of a broader wave of Salesforce-related attacks that is hitting organizations across sectors, from tech and finance to retail and aviation. Alongside Google, Farmers Insurance, Allianz Life, Workday, Pandora, Cisco, Chanel and Qantas, brands like Adidas, Louis Vuitton, Dior, Tiffany & Co., Cartier and Air France-KLM have also reported incidents tied to weaknesses in Salesforce-linked applications.",
      "In most cases, attackers exploited malicious third-party integrations or OAuth-connected apps disguised as legitimate Salesforce tools to siphon sensitive records. This technique bypassed traditional login protections and gave intruders long-lasting access to customer relationship management data. The stolen information ranges from basic contact details and business notes to highly sensitive identifiers such as Social Security numbers, dates of birth and driver's license information.",
      "Researchers say these intrusions align with activity from the extortion group ShinyHunters, with some overlap in tactics and infrastructure linked to other threat actors like Scattered Spider. Campaigns tracked under names such as UNC6395 and UNC6040 point to a larger \"extortion-as-a-service\" model, where criminal crews collaborate and share stolen data across underground forums.",
      "TransUnion's response",
      "CyberGuy reached out to TransUnion for a comment and received the following response:",
      "\"TransUnion recently experienced a cyber incident that affected a third-party application serving our U.S. consumer support operations. Upon discovery, we quickly contained the issue, which did not involve our core credit database or include credit reports.",
      "The incident involved unauthorized access to limited personal information for a very small percentage of U.S. consumers. We are working with law enforcement and have engaged third-party cybersecurity experts for an independent forensics review. Additionally, we will notify affected consumers and provide credit monitoring services.\"",
      "As for the gap between when the breach occurred (July 28, 2025) and when it was officially recorded as \"discovered\" (July 30, 2025), a TransUnion spokesperson clarified that the company\u00a0\"identified and contained this event within hours\" of it happening, but that it is common industry practice to designate a later \"date of discovery\" to reflect a more complete assessment following the initial response.",

      "Go through old online accounts, shopping profiles or cloud storage that may still hold sensitive data. Deleting what you no longer use reduces the amount of information that could be stolen in future breaches or sold on dark web forums. You can also get help from a data removal service.",

      "Data stolen in breaches often ends up fueling phishing campaigns. Attackers may use your name, email or phone number to make messages look more convincing. If you get an email or text claiming to be from TransUnion, your bank or any service asking you to \"verify\" details, don't click on the link. Instead, log in through the official website or call customer service directly.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",

      "If your login details were exposed, reusing the same password across sites puts multiple accounts at risk. Use a password manager to create and store strong, unique passwords for every service. Even if hackers get hold of one, they won't be able to use it elsewhere. Consider using a password manager to generate and store complex passwords.",
      "Next, see if your passwords have been exposed in past breaches. Our No. 1 password manager (see Cyberguy.com/Passwords) pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your passwords have appeared in known leaks. If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.",

      "HACKERS FOUND A WAY TO TURN OFF WINDOWS DEFENDER REMOTELY",
      "Two-factor authentication (2FA)\u00a0adds a critical extra step beyond just a password. If someone tries to break into your email, banking app or social media account, they'll also need the one-time code from your authenticator app or text message. This makes stolen credentials much less useful.",
      "Hackers often rely on outdated software to spread malware or steal information. Installing the latest updates for your phone, computer and apps ensures security patches are in place, blocking known vulnerabilities that attackers might exploit.",
      "One of the biggest risks after a breach is criminals opening new loans or credit cards in your name. A credit freeze with all three major bureaus, TransUnion, Equifax and Experian, prevents anyone from accessing your credit file without your approval. It's free and can be temporarily lifted if you need to apply for credit.",
      "Watch your bank and credit card statements for unfamiliar charges, no matter how small. Set up transaction alerts where available. You should also pull your free annual credit report to check for unauthorized accounts or inquiries, which could be signs of fraud.",
      "If your Social Security number, driver's license or other sensitive identifiers were exposed, you may want to sign up for an identity theft protection service. These services monitor credit reports, dark web forums and financial activity for signs of misuse. Some also include insurance or recovery assistance if your identity is stolen, giving you added peace of mind beyond basic credit monitoring. If you're one of the affected TransUnion users, make use of the 24 months of free credit monitoring and identity theft protection services. If not, you might get one yourself for the future.",

      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "The reality is that the TransUnion breach isn't just about stolen names and numbers. It's about how exposed ordinary people are when a single company holds the keys to their financial identity. For years, consumers have had little choice but to trust credit bureaus they never opted into.",

      "Steven Bixby, 58, was set to die in May for the killing of two police officers before the state Supreme Court stepped in and stopped his execution so it could be determined if he is mentally competent.

      "A psychologist previously said Bixby understands what led to his death sentence, but that he also believes blood found on his clothes the night of the killings contains the DNA of Jesus Christ.",

      "Wilson's dying body was pulled inside the home by the family and restrained with his own handcuffs. The Bixbys then killed state Constable Donnie Ouzts as he and other officers responded to the home because Wilson had been missing for an hour, leading to a 12-hour standoff as officers and the family fired hundreds of shots at each other, investigators said.",
      "Lawyers for Bixby argued at a hearing last month that he is convinced the U.S. legal system is unconstitutional and wrong, and refuses to share information needed to help him avoid execution. Prosecutors contended that Bixby's anti-government beliefs are shared by others and that he understands why the state wants to end his life.",

I merely asked two questions I thought were legitimate,\" Hermlin said.",
      "Known on social media as \"Daveetheewave,\" Hermlin has built a reputation not just for his music but for his image.

      "Hermlin also faced criticism for wearing the small yellow lapel pin, which symbolizes solidarity with the 50 hostages still held by Hamas. Festivalgoers suggested the pin was inflammatory or political propaganda. Hermlin rejects that characterization.\"People pointed at my yellow pin and said, maybe people are aggressive because of your pin. I asked them, do you know what it means?

      "FIRST ON FOX: A new study disputes claims that\u00a0Israel committed genocide in Gaza following Hamas\u2019 Oct. 7, 2023 massacre, arguing that allegations of starvation, indiscriminate bombing and deliberate civilian killings lack verifiable evidence.",
      "The report by researchers from the Begin-Sadat Center for Strategic Studies at Bar-Ilan University, \"Debunking the Genocide Allegations: A Reexamination of the Israel-Hamas War\" (2023-2025), contends that the genocide narrative has been driven by faulty data, uncritical sourcing and a humanitarian system vulnerable to manipulation.",
      "A key element of the genocide accusations is the claim that Israel deliberately starved Gaza\u2019s population. The study argues that \"claims of starvation prior to March 2, 2025, were based on erroneous data, circular citations, and a failure to critically review sources.\" While U.N. officials and rights groups maintained that 500 trucks a day were needed to prevent famine, prewar U.N. figures show Gaza averaged 292 daily in 2022 \u2014 only 73 of them carrying food.",

      "The Chief of the General Staff LTG Eyal Zamir, conducted a field tour in the Gaza Strip. (IDF Spokesman's Unit)",
      "\"That was completely adequate to meet demand,\" report co-author Danny Orbach, a military historian from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, told Fox News Digital.",
      "The study says Israel regularly surpassed the food supply needed during the war, averaging more than 100 trucks a day through March 2025. During a ceasefire-for-hostage deal, that number climbed to about 600 daily.",
      "\"The idea that\u00a0Hamas didn\u2019t seize aid is absurd,\" Orbach said. \"In every conflict, armed groups take the bulk of humanitarian supplies. We have documents and testimonies proving Hamas did so.\"",
      "The report argues that genocide allegations spread through what Orbach called an \"inverted funnel of information.\" Journalists and aid workers in Gaza often depended on Hamas-linked translators and fixers, whose accounts filtered into U.N. reports, mainstream media and online platforms.",
      "\"The average Westerner sees dozens of reports about Israeli crimes and assumes they must be true. But they all trace back to a handful of Hamas-affiliated sources,\" Orbach said.",

      "The second factor is \"humanitarian bias\" \u2014 the tendency to exaggerate conditions to prompt action. \"Organizations warn of famine before it happens, relying on dubious facts to change reality. Questioning becomes an immoral act,\" Orbach said.",
      "The genocide allegation also rests on claims that Israel intentionally targeted civilians, but the study acknowledges civilian deaths while finding no evidence of a systematic policy of massacre.",
      "Orbach cited BBC data showing that between May 2024 and January 2025, 550 people were killed in designated safe zones\u2014just 2.1% to 3.5% of total casualties, even though half of Gaza\u2019s population was concentrated there for much of the period.",

      "ISRAEL TURNS TABLES ON UN OFFICIAL CLAIMING 'GENOCIDE' IN GAZA WITH BASIC QUESTIONS",
      "\"That indicates the zones were relatively safe, despite Hamas using them to launch rockets,\" Orbach stated.",
      "The report notes that context is crucial, stating that Hamas deliberately positioned itself in civilian areas, used human shields and blocked evacuations to increase civilian casualties and international condemnation of Israel.",
      "\"Hamas exposes its own people to danger intentionally so Israel will be blamed,\" Orbach said.",

      "While critics have accused the Israeli air force of indiscriminate bombing, the study finds that strikes generally targeted military objectives, though civilian casualties were inevitable.",
      "\"The IDF is the first army in history to issue\u00a0focused warnings, deliver large-scale aid into enemy territory, and sacrifice surprise to protect civilians,\" he said. \"You cannot fight an enemy embedded in 500 kilometers of tunnels, dressed as civilians without massive destruction.\"",
      "The study pays particular attention to casualty figures published by the Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry, claiming they were manipulated to create misleading impressions of the demographics of the dead. It presents alternative statistical models suggesting combatant fatalities may have been underreported, distorting the civilian-to-combatant ratio.",
      "Hamas terrorists carrying clubs and firearms secure and divert humanitarian aid trucks in the northern Gaza area of Jabaliya on June. 25 (TPS-IL)",
      "The report says that genocide requires systematic intent to destroy a people \u2014 something it finds absent in Gaza. \"You don\u2019t see the hallmarks of genocidal warfare here,\" Orbach said. \"There are no campaigns of rape, frontal massacres or close-range executions. In other conflicts in\u00a0the Middle East, dozens of such atrocities occurred in just a few hours of fighting.\"",

      "Orbach and his fellow authors conclude that allegations of genocide against Israel rely on politicized narratives, selective data and the exploitation of humanitarian discourse.",
      "\"Analyzing devastation or civilian deaths without understanding Hamas\u2019 tactics is absurd,\" he stated.",

      "Breyer's order blocks the administration \"from deploying, ordering, instructing, training, or using the National Guard currently deployed in California, and any military troops heretofore deployed in California, to execute the laws, including but not limited to engaging in arrests, apprehensions, searches, seizures, security patrols, traffic control, crowd control, riot control, evidence collection, (or) interrogation.\"",

      "Court blocks Alien Enemies Act deportations",
      "Also on Tuesday, an appeals court in Louisiana issued an order blocking the administration from deporting alleged Venezuelan gang members using the Alien Enemies Act of 1798.",
      "Trump invoked the rarely used wartime power in an executive order in March to deport alleged members of Venezuela\u2019s Tren de Aragua (TdA) gang, an organization he said was \"perpetrating, attempting, and threatening an invasion or predatory incursion against the territory of the United States.\"",
      "The 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which had been tasked with reviewing the issue by the Supreme Court, found the government had not shown there was a warlike invasion going on.",
      "\u201cOur analysis leads us to GRANT a preliminary injunction to prevent removal because we find no invasion or predatory incursion,\u201d the panel\u2019s majority wrote.",
      "The judges also noted that TdA has been designated as a foreign terrorist organization and  \"there are other provisions that would allow the Government to promptly remove precisely those individuals whom it seeks to remove under the President\u2019s Proclamation.\"",
      "Jackson, the White House spokesperson, in a statement following the ruling, defended the president's actions and said administration officials \"expect to be vindicated.\"",
      "\u201cThe authority to conduct national security operations in defense of the United States and to remove terrorists from the United States rests solely with the President,\" she said. \"President Trump exercised this lawful authority and employed the Alien Enemies Act to remove enemies of the United States, including vicious TdA gang members, from the country.\"",
      "Trump takes tariff fight to the Supreme Court",
      "The ruling the president has expressed the most concern about was handed down on Aug. 29, when the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit found he had exceeded his authority when he imposed tariffs using an emergency powers statute.",
      "\u201cTariffs are a core Congressional power,\u201d it said, upholding a lower court's finding that Trump's orders are \u201cinvalid as contrary to law.\u201d",
      "The ruling affects two sets of tariffs Trump has sought to impose, but not others imposed under other laws.",
      "The tariffs are still in effect and will remain in place until at least Oct. 14 to give the government time for further appeals.",
      "The administration asked the Supreme Court to hear the case in an emergency filing on Wednesday.",
      "\u201cSwift review of that decision is necessary to avoid derailing critical ongoing negotiations with our foreign trading partners and threatening broader U.S. strategic interests internationally,\u201d Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent wrote in a declaration supporting the appeal.",
      "Deportation move 'arbitrary and capricious'",
      "In a ruling late Friday, a federal judge in the Northern District of California ruled that Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem\u2019s actions \u201cin vacating the orders of the prior administration and terminating\" Temporary Protected Status for hundreds of thousands of people from Haiti and Venezuela exceeded her statutory authority and must be set aside.",
      "\u201cThe Secretary\u2019s action in revoking TPS was not only unprecedented in the manner and speed in which it was taken but also violates the law,\u201d U.S. District Judge Edward Chen wrote in his 69-page order.",

      "The two-day event was slated to be held Sept. 13-14 in the city\u2019s Grant Park, but officials and organizers said they decided to postpone \u201cdue to possible U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement activity and a potential National Guard deployment,\u201d saying the festival\u2019s location made it a \u201cmore visible target.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis was a painful decision; however, with the heightened political tensions and given our location in downtown Chicago, we need to keep our community safe,\u201d organizer German Gonzalez said in a statement. \u201cTo proceed in spite of the advice we\u2019ve received directly from city and state officials and potentially expose our community to becoming collateral damage would be irresponsible. That\u2019s a risk we are not willing to take.\u201d",
      "Organizers urged participants to still celebrate Mexican Independence Day \u201cin a safe, respectful and responsible way and to support Mexican American businesses around the city and state.\u201d",
      "No future date was given for the celebrations and the festival\u2019s website said it was issuing refunds for all tickets.",
      "\u201cFull refunds will begin immediately to everyone who purchased tickets through our website or TicketSignup,\u201d the website stated. \u201cRefunds will go back to the original form of payment. Please allow 7 to 10 business days for processing.\u201d",
      "Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson said he respects that organizers are doing \u201cwhat they believe is in the best interests of the city and the Mexican community.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt is shameful that the President\u2019s reckless, militarized immigration enforcement tactics have forced organizers of El Grito to postpone the celebration this year,\u201d Johnson said in a statement. \u201cChicago honors, celebrates, and loves its cultural communities, and that will not change.\u201d",
      "Johnson clarified that the city did not recommend cancelling or postponing the event, adding that \u201cthe City believes strongly that the decision to proceed with or cancel events this month is in the hands of the organizers and the communities hosting them.\u201d",

      "Preps for Mexican Independence celebrations continue despite ICE concerns",
      "Pritzker \u2018deeply concerned\u2019 about ICE targeting Mexican Independence Day events",
      "Earlier this week, Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker said he was \u201cdeeply concerned\u201d that ICE would target Mexican Independence Day events in Chicago. The governor warned that \u201cunidentifiable agents in unmarked vehicles with masks are planning to raid Latino communities and say they\u2019re targeting violent criminals,\u201d while noting that timing of such a deployment could be intentional.",
      "\u201cWe have reason to believe that Stephen Miller chose the month of September to come to Chicago because of celebrations around Mexican Independence Day that happen here every year,\u201d Pritzker said. \u201cIt breaks my heart to report that we have been told ICE will try and disrupt community picnics and peaceful parades. Let\u2019s be clear: the terror and cruelty is the point, not the safety of anyone living here.\u201d",
      "Several parades and festivals are still scheduled for the upcoming weekend to celebrate Mexican Independence Day, though it remains unclear if additional cancellations will come.",
      "Mexican Independence Day event organizers recently spoke to NBC Chicago about how they\u2019re preparing for the possible presence of specialized ICE tactical units at the events.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re simply celebrating their heritage, they shouldn\u2019t be interrupted in this way,\u201d Pritzker said.",
      "President Donald Trump had previously told reporters \u201cwe\u2019re going in\u201d when asked about a slew of circulating rumors that the White House has plans to send troops to Chicago to address crime.",
      "\u201cRumors have been swirling about what the White House has planned, and sifting fact from fiction has been increasingly difficult because Donald Trump\u2019s administration is not working in coordination with the city of Chicago, Cook County or the state of Illinois,\u201d Pritzker said.",
      "While no official announcement has been made around the National Guard, the Trump administration has reportedly been planning to send members to Chicago in a similar manner to how they were deployed to Washington, D.C. in recent weeks, according to the National Guard and other outlets.",
      "Pritzker also confirmed to NBC Chicago\u2019s Mary Ann Ahern just hours before the press conference that ICE agents will be conducting enhanced immigration enforcement operations in the city in coming days.",
      "\u201c[They said] they will begin operations here sometime in the coming week,\u201d Pritzker said in the exclusive interview. \u201cThat \u2014 literally after two weeks of all this talk about troops on the ground \u2014 that\u2019s the first time we\u2019ve heard from the federal government on this.\u201d",
      "Pritzker also said during the press conference that he believes staging for federal enforcement in Chicago has \u201calready begun.\u201d",
      "Still, the administration of Texas Gov. Greg Abbott pushed back against Pritzker\u2019s assertion that Texas National Guard members were deploying to Chicago, saying the governor and City Council members were \u201cnot in the loop\u201d on any operations.",
      "\u201cGovernor Abbott and the State of Texas are ready, willing, and able to deploy all necessary resources to clean up the streets of Chicago should President Trump call upon us to do so,\u201d a spokesperson for Abbott told NBC Chicago.",
      "In anticipation of increased enforcement efforts, Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson last week signed an executive order, declaring Chicago police will not collaborate with military on police patrols or civil immigration enforcement.",
      "Crime rose over the holiday weekend compared to last year; at least 58 people were shot, eight fatally, during Labor Day weekend this year. Last Labor Day weekend, at least 42 people were shot and 10 people killed, the Sun-Times reported.",
      "However, overall violent crime in the city, including homicides, is down year over year, according to city data."

    "story": [
      "Anthropic, a major artificial intelligence company, has agreed to pay at least $1.5 billion to settle a copyright infringement lawsuit filed by a group of authors who alleged the platform had illegally used pirated copies of their books to train large-language models, according to court documents.",
      "\u201cIf approved, this landmark settlement will be the largest publicly reported copyright recovery in history, larger than any other copyright class action settlement or any individual copyright case litigated to final judgment,\u201d said Justin Nelson, a lawyer for the authors.",
      "The lawsuit, filed in federal court in California last year, centered on roughly 500,000 published works. The proposed settlement amounts to a gross recovery of $3,000 per work, Nelson said in a memorandum to the judge in the case.",
      "\u201cThis result is nothing short of remarkable,\u201d Nelson added.",
      "In the lawsuit, the plaintiffs alleged that Anthrophic had \u201ccommitted large-scale copyright infringement\u201d by downloading and \u201ccommercially exploiting\u201d books that it had allegedly gotten from pirating websites such as Library Genesis and Pirate Library Mirror.",
      "Anthropic had argued that what it was doing fell under \u201cfair use\u201d under U.S. copyright law. In late June, the federal judge assigned to the case ruled that Anthropic\u2019s actions constituted fair use because the end result was \u201cexceedingly transformative.\u201d",
      "But that ruling from Judge William Alsup came with crucial asterisks. He declared that downloading pirated copies of books did not constitute fair use.",
      "\u201cIn June, the District Court issued a landmark ruling on AI development and copyright law, finding that Anthropic\u2019s approach to training AI models constitutes fair use,\u201d said Aparna Sridhar, the deputy general counsel of Anthropic.",
      "\u201cToday\u2019s settlement, if approved, will resolve the plaintiffs\u2019 remaining legacy claims. We remain committed to developing safe AI systems that help people and organizations extend their capabilities, advance scientific discovery, and solve complex problems.\u201d Sridhar added.",
      "The lawsuit was originally filed by three writers: Andrea Bartz, Charles Graeber and Kirk Wallace Johnson. Bartz is a journalist and novelist; Graeber and Johnson are journalists who have published nonfiction books.",
      "Bartz, Graeber and Johnson did not immediately respond to requests for comment.",
      "The settlement could shape the trajectory of other pending litigation between AI platforms and published authors.",
      "John Grisham, \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d author George R.R. Martin and Jodi Picoult are part of a group of nearly 20 bestselling authors who have sued OpenAI, alleging \u201csystematic theft on a mass scale\u201d for using their works to train ChatGPT and other tools.",
      "Anthropic agreed to make four payments into the settlement fund, starting with a $300 million payout due within five business days of the court\u2019s sign-off on the terms, according to Nelson.",
      "Nelson\u2019s memo to Alsup said the proposed $1.5 billion payout is the \u201cminimum size\u201d of the settlement. \u201cIf the Works List ultimately exceeds 500,000 works,\u201d he said, \u201cthen Anthropic will pay an additional $3,000 per work that Anthropic adds to the Works List above 500,000 works.\u201d"

      "Sam McKnight, who was Diana\u2019s hairstylist from 1990 until her tragic death in 1997, defended the former Kate Middleton after she debuted a longer blond hair style when she and husband Prince William visited the Natural History Museum in London on Sept. 4.",
      "\"I am shocked, horrified, dismayed and disgusted by all the nasty comments about the Princess of Wales today. A woman\u2019s hair is very personal to her, it\u2019s armour, defence, confidence and so much more,\" McKnight wrote in a message he posted the same day on Instagram.",
      "\u201cI cannot believe how evil and lacking in any kind of empathy are the comments, the majority made apparently by other women, attacking a vulnerable other young woman, who has no choice, by dint of who she married, and the role she took on, to bravely face the public,\" he continued.",
      "McKnight went on to reference Kate\u2019s 2024 cancer diagnosis in his message, saying he believed the mom of three would prefer to \"be away from the public arena.\"",
      "\"She has brilliantly and quietly, unselfishly represented our country, the soft power we still have as a nation,\" he wrote, adding, \"Cancer affects individuals differently, but is life-changing for everyone. So FFS LEAVE HER ALONE. SHAME ON YOU.\"",
      "Kate announced in March 2024 that she had been diagnosed with an unspecified form of cancer.  She later shared in January 2025 that she was in remission.",
      "The debut of Kate's new longer blond hair comes two months after she visited patients at a hospital in Essex, England, on July 2. While at the hospital, Kate spoke candidly to patients about her cancer journey.",
      "\u201cYou put on a sort of brave face (with) stoicism through treatment. (When) treatment\u2019s done, then it\u2019s like, \u2018I can crack on, get back to normal again,\u2019\u201d she said, according to video footage from the BBC.",
      "\u201cBut,\" she added, \"actually the phase afterwards is really difficult, you\u2019re not necessarily under the clinical team any longer, but you\u2019re not able to function normally at home as you perhaps once used to.\"",
      "Cancer, she told the patients, can be hard on the patient and also his or her loved ones. \"Through first diagnosis or post treatment and things like that, it is a life-changing experience both for the patient but also for the families as well,\" said Kate.",
      "\u201cYou have to find your new normal and that takes time,\" she said, adding, \"and it\u2019s a rollercoaster. It\u2019s not one smooth plane, which you expect it to be. But the reality is it\u2019s not, you go through hard times.\""

      "Seizing the opportunity, Ken and Esmeralda accept on his behalf. Though, no one can understand them because they spend the whole time talking over each other. Before Ken and Esmeralda can get into a fight over the award, Ned arrives and starts delivering a heartfelt speech \u2014 that is, until Esmeralda \u201cfaints.\u201d Don\u2019t worry, she\u2019s fine. In fact, the documentary crew catches her smiling as everyone rushes to her side.",
      "At the end of the night, Oscar shares relationship advice with Ned that makes him reconsider telling Mare how he really feels. Soon after, Ned rushes to Mare\u2019s door and hands her the speech he wrote. Mare says it\u2019s not a good time, leading Ned to assume she's still with Theo. However, she reveals it\u2019s because Nicole is crying in her hotel room over her breakup with Detrick.",
      "In the end, Ned and Mare\u2019s journalistic integrity kicks in and they decide they must kiss for research purposes, hoping if they \u201cget it out of the way,\u201d they could go back to being friends. But if Ned\u2019s \u201coh, s---\u201d response tells us anything, it\u2019s that there is a lot more to unpack come Season 2.",
      "Frei, who plays Mare, tells TODAY.com her and Gleeson\u2019s final scene could have ended without any lip action.",
      "\u201cBecause Donald\u2019s character is so by the book and wants to be a good boss, we filmed it a million different ways. They kiss. They didn\u2019t kiss. They get into a fight,\u201d she says of the different approaches. \u201cSo it was really cool to see that (the directors) ended up choosing the kiss.\u201d",
      "For Frei, Chelsea's budding romance with Ned reminded her of another relationship in her life.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s funny because my parents met on a construction site,\u201d Frei says. \u201cMy dad was the boss, and my mom was the secretary. I know it\u2019s ridiculous, but they\u2019re still together over 30 years later. So, what are you going to do? It works.\u201d",
      "Fans will get to see in Season 2 of \u201cThe Paper\u201d if Ned and Mare\u2019s relationship has what it takes to follow suit."

    "story": [
      "With a list of credits a mile long, it\u2019s tempting to wonder if there\u2019s anything David Duchovny can\u2019t do.",
      "The four-time Emmy-nominated actor and director has appeared in dozens of TV shows and movies; fronts his own alternative rock band; hosts a podcast; and has had seven books published, including his latest effort, \u201cAbout Time,\u201d a book of Duchovny\u2019s collected poetry.",
      "\u201cIt was a way for me ... to try and talk about things that felt almost too deep for words, almost like journaling, but before we journaled,\u201d Duchovny tells Savannah Guthrie and Willie Geist during a recent appearance on Jenna & Friends.",
      "Despite being his first published book in the genre, \u201cThe X-Files\u201d star says he\u2019s been writing poetry since he was a teen. He eventually parlayed that love of prose into an English literature degree from Princeton University, as well as earning a master's from Yale University. In the process, Duchovny picked up an honorable mention nod from the Academy of American Poets for his work.",
      "\u201cThey sent me a plaque,\u201d Duchovny tells TODAY.com during a sit-down interview. \u201cBut, oddly, as I was getting up early yesterday morning to come from LA to (New York) and was reaching around in the dark for things that I needed, I knocked over this plaque and I broke it.\u201d",
      "\u201cSo, I thought, \u2018Is this a good omen or bad omen?\u2019 We don\u2019t know,\u201d Duchovny says with a laugh.",
      "Either way, \u201cAbout Time\u201d is a catharsis of sorts for the actor who says he\u2019s always looking for new means of \u201cservicing the inspiration,\u201d which he says he\u2019s fortunate to have plenty of.",
      "\u201cWhy I find myself doing many different things, I think, is because I\u2019m constantly trying to express something, and I\u2019m looking for the best vessel to do that in,\u201d Duchovny says about deciding on which outlet works best for channeling his feelings and ideas.",
      "\u201cIt usually starts in language, and that leads into acting, directing, poetry, fiction, writing,\u201d he explains. \u201cSo, it\u2019s really just finding different ways because the form is going to influence the expression. And I find that to be interesting.\u201d",
      "\u2018Life Is a Game\u2019",
      "At 65, Duchovny is celebrating his recent marriage to longtime girlfriend Monique Pendleberry. Prior to Pendleberry, he was married for nearly two decades to T\u00e9a Leoni, with whom he shares two children: West, 26, and Kyd, 23.",
      "When asked what he hopes he\u2019s imparted on his children, Duchovny ponders for a moment before answering, \u201cI think to take away the sense that life is just game, it doesn\u2019t mean anything.\u201d",
      "Not that life is trivial, he clarifies, but rather he hopes his kids take things seriously \u2014 but not too seriously.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a sense in which you want your kids to find their passion,\u201d says Duchovny, who explains that having passion is good, unless it prevents you from keeping an open mind to other possibilities.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m always saying, that\u2019s not the world. There\u2019s many different worlds. But, yes, find the thing that turns you on. So, I\u2019m giving them very bad advice, I\u2019m giving contradictory advice.\u201d",

      "In reflecting on his own life, would he do anything differently if he could go back and do it all again?",
      "\u201cWell, I can\u2019t,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd it makes no sense to try and relive, relitigate or redo because you can\u2019t.\u201d",
      "Instead, he prefers to focus on the philosophy behind failure, the subject of his popular podcast, \u201cFail Better,\u201d which he launched in 2024.",
      "In the Q&A podcast, Duchovny interviews newsmakers like Bette Midler, Ben Stiller and Amanda Knox about how perceived failure can actually be the catalyst for opportunity and personal growth.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t know when we\u2019re on the right road. Most of the time, we just know we\u2019re on some kind of road and we have some kind of goal,\u201d he says about the concepts of success and failure.",
      "\u201cFailure towards an imperfect goal or a wrong goal or whatever you think you\u2019re going or doing can be a good thing. So, failure and success are really, at this point, I don\u2019t see them as meaningful. They\u2019re just snapshots in time. What could be a success is actually a failure waiting to happen and vice versa.\u201d",
      "On \u2018The X-Files\u2019: \u2018They Really Had a Crystal Ball\u2019",
      "On the subject of success, one of Duchovny\u2019s notable accomplishments is his turn as FBI agent Fox Mulder on the hit show \u201cThe X-Files.\u201d The sci-fi program, which originally ran from 1993-2002 before reboots in 2016 and 2018, launched his career and made the actor a household name.",

      "Known for its spooky UFO and paranormal themes, was there ever an episode that left Duchovny feeling particularly unsettled?",
      "\u201cSometimes I think back, and I said this to (series creator) Chris Carter, 'I think you really were kind of Nostradamus in a way. You really saw a lot of what\u2019s going on, a lot of the conspiratorial thinking and stuff like that happen.' So, it\u2019s not really one episode, but I\u2019m just kind of amazed at that writers room, which included Vince Gilligan, Jim Wong, Darin Morgan, Glen Morgan, Howard Gordon. This was a heavy-hitting writers room, and they really had a crystal ball.\u201d",
      "\u2018I\u2019m Not Content Ever\u2019",
      "In addition to his latest book, Duchovny says he\u2019s also just wrapped a new album, though he\u2019s not sure when it\u2019ll be released.",

      "With so many projects on his plate, it begs the question: Does Duchovny have unfinished business?",
      "\u201cNo,\u201d he says without hesitating. \u201cNo. There\u2019s just more business.\u201d",
      "Even so, it doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s static.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not content ever. It\u2019s good to have a new thing to do or to have a new project because they all have different hurdles. They all have different problems to solve. And that\u2019s when you get creative is when you\u2019re solving problems.\u201d"

    "published": "Fri, 05 Sep 2025 09:00:42 GMT",
    "summary": "If a peace deal between Russia and Ukraine ever comes together, the U.S. could take the lead role in monitoring a large buffer zone inside Ukraine.",
    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 If a peace deal between Russia and Ukraine ever comes together, the United States could take the lead role in monitoring a large buffer zone inside Ukraine envisioned as a way to protect the country from Russia, according to four people familiar with a plan that military officials from Ukraine\u2019s allies, including the United States, have been discussing.",
      "The buffer zone would be a large demilitarized area \u2014 the borders of which have not yet been decided \u2014 inside what is now Ukraine, dividing Russian and Ukrainian territory within the country. In part because of its technological capabilities, the United States would take the lead in watching the buffer zone, using drones and satellites along with other intelligence capabilities, but it would coordinate with other countries that would also monitor.",
      "The zone could then be secured by troops from one or more non-NATO countries, like Saudi Arabia or even Bangladesh, according to the people familiar with the plan. No U.S. troops would be deployed inside Ukraine, they said. Politico previously reported the general idea of a buffer zone.",
      "Russian President Vladimir Putin would have to agree to any plan for security guarantees for Ukraine, and NATO involvement or even the suggestion of it is a major issue for him, so the planners are taking pains to avoid using NATO forces or anything resembling NATO branding, some of the people familiar with the plan said.",
      "Instead, some of the guarantees would be likely to rely on the troops from non-NATO countries and on a patchwork of bilateral agreements among Ukraine and its allies that would give Ukraine security assurances without involving NATO\u2019s Article V \u2014 an attack on one means an attack on all \u2014 which amounts to a red line for Moscow.",
      "Any plan is only tentative until Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy agree to one, in addition to the leaders of the countries that would be involved in the security guarantees, including President Donald Trump.",
      "This one has been developed in the wake of Trump\u2019s meeting with Putin in Alaska on Aug. 15. That meeting was initially expected to lead to further talks, possibly direct discussions between Putin and Zelenskyy, but progress toward a peace deal has stalled since then. Still, Ukraine\u2019s allies have gone ahead with their work on the potential security guarantees, which would most likely be key to peace.",
      "On Thursday, members of the group of allies, which is informally known as the \u201ccoalition of the willing,\u201d met to potentially formalize aspects of the plan. The meeting was led by France and the United Kingdom, which are also expected to head up the overall effort to provide Ukraine with security after the war\u2019s end.",
      "Zelenskyy wrote on X after the meeting: \u201cWe discussed in detail each country\u2019s readiness to make a contribution to ensuring security on land, at sea, in the air, and in cyberspace. We coordinated positions and reviewed elements of security guarantees.\u201d",
      "On Friday, though, Putin rejected the idea of troops from other countries playing any role, saying, \u201cAs for possible military contingents in Ukraine \u2014 this is one of the primary reasons for drawing Ukraine into NATO. ...  And if decisions are reached that will lead to peace, to a long-term peace, then I simply do not see any sense in their presence on the territory of Ukraine. That\u2019s all. Because if these agreements are reached, let no one doubt that Russia will implement them in full. And we will respect those security guarantees that, of course, must be developed for both Russia and Ukraine. And, I repeat once again, of course, Russia will fulfill the agreement.\u201d",
      "Putin's stance is one of many challenges involved as planning moves forward. There are also tough decisions to be made about what kind of Russian incursions would trigger a response from either Ukraine or the monitoring forces and what kind of response would be allowed. one of the sources said. This person said that the rules of engagement still need to be worked out and that they are likely to be contested during any disagreements after a deal and the buffer are in place.",
      "Along with the buffer zone, it would also be important to guarantee that Russia could not choke off Ukraine\u2019s economy. To that point, Turkey would be responsible for ensuring the unimpeded flow of goods and services on the Black Sea by conducting maritime surveillance of and enforcement in the Bosporus and Dardanelles straits. Shortly after Russia invaded Ukraine, Turkey played a part in securing the maritime corridor that was established to get grain out of Ukraine.",
      "At the Pentagon, talks are being led by Air Force Gen. Dan Caine, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, with a broader discussion also centered on deterrence, training and defense industrial cooperation. On the latter front, the United States is discussing with Ukraine a deal that could be worth around $100 billion, under which Kyiv would be able to buy American weapons, while in exchange the United States would get intellectual property rights for the cutting-edge systems the Ukrainians have been developing, according to a U.S. official.",
      "The week after Trump met with Putin, Caine briefed Trump on four options for the security guarantee and recommended the most forward-leaning approach, this official said.",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt did not address the contours of the plan in a statement to NBC News.",
      "\u201cPresident Trump is the decision maker,\u201d she wrote. \u201cOut of respect for ongoing diplomatic negotiations, the White House is not going to get ahead of him on these important matters.\u201d",
      "She added: \u201cAnyone anonymously claiming to know what he will or will not support doesn\u2019t know what they are talking about.\u201d",
      "The people familiar with the plan who spoke with NBC News did not say Trump had endorsed or ruled out any of the options."

And it is on that platform that both the United States and Israel are built and that puts us in a very, very special relationship.\u201d",
      "Huckabee\u2019s strong ties to Israel were forged during more than 100 visits to the country before his appointment and are grounded in a belief that God commanded Jewish sovereignty over their biblical homeland.",
      "His ambassadorship could end up being deeply consequential. Not only was it a win for the evangelical Christian community, a vital part of Trump\u2019s base, but it was also a boon to Israel\u2019s far-right government as it faces unprecedented criticism for its war in the Gaza Strip. His stances in just over six months in Israel have hewn closely to the government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s, even as Trump expresses occasional unease with the close U.S. ally\u2019s conduct.",
      "In July, images of badly emaciated children in Gaza prompted Trump to acknowledge \u201creal starvation\u201d in the enclave \u2014 a break with Netanyahu, who maintained there was no starvation.",
      "The following month, on Aug. 22, the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification, the world\u2019s leading body on hunger, officially declared famine in part of northern Gaza, including Gaza City. For months before that announcement, international humanitarian organizations had warned that the trickle of aid Israel had allowed into the enclave wasn\u2019t nearly enough to feed its population of 2.1 million."

    "published": "Thu, 04 Sep 2025 14:48:07 GMT",
    "summary": "An iconic winged lion that has perched above Venice for centuries, may have originated in China, according to a new study.",
    "story": [
      "For centuries, an iconic winged lion has perched above Venice, a symbol of the \u201cFloating City\u201d that millions of tourists have passed under in St. Mark\u2019s Square.",
      "But scientists now believe that this ancient emblem of the Italian city may in fact have origins a world away.",
      "A study released Thursday found evidence that the statue may have been partially made in China and arrived in northern Italy after a long journey across the medieval Silk Road that may have involved the father of the explorer Marco Polo and the court of the Mongol emperor Kublai Khan.",
      "Historical documents confirm the statue was in Venice by the late 13th century, but its history before that remains murky.",
      "How the lion made its way to Venice \u2014 an economic powerhouse in the medieval world owing to its strategic position close to Europe and the Byzantine Empire \u2014 has long been a mystery.",
      "It was assumed by experts that the statue may have come from ancient Persia or Syria.",
      "By studying copper isotopes taken from samples of the statue, scientists were able to identify that the metal originated from the Yangtze River in eastern-central China, more than 8,000 miles away from where it now stands.",
      "Their findings were published in the archeology journal Antiquity.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a rather extraordinary discovery,\u201d Hannah Skoda, associate professor of medieval history at the University of Oxford, told NBC News.",
      "\u201cAt the same time it is indicative of the sheer extent and intensity of global trading networks, even in this really early period,\u201d which would have made the long journey from China to Italy via the Silk Road possible all those centuries ago,\" Skoda, who was not involved in the study, said in a phone interview.",
      "The study\u2019s conclusion \u201cis striking \u2014 though perhaps not quite as improbable as it might sound,\u201d said Peter Frankopan, professor of global history at Oxford and author of \u201cThe Silk Roads: A New History of the World.\u201d",
      "\u201cDiscoveries like this are not unusual once you start to look carefully at the materials, the motifs and the methods that shaped the cities we think we know,\u201d he said by email.",
      "The statue may not even be a lion at all, the study suggests.",
      "Researchers argue that the figure closely mirrors tomb guardians from the Tang dynasty, which ruled from the 6th to 9th centuries during China\u2019s golden age. These ancient sculptures were known as \u201czhenmushou\u201d and share similar features with the Venice statue such as the position of the ears and the distinctive \u201cbulbous nose,\u201d according to the study.",
      "There are no written records telling us where the statue that now looks down from a Piazzetta column in St. Mark\u2019s came from. The only historical document mentioning it dates to 1293, and researchers have long presumed that the statue had a rich history before it made its way to Venice.",
      "Scientists still don\u2019t have a firm grasp on how exactly the statue traversed such great distances across multiple continents all those years ago. However, the study suggests that Niccolo and Maffeo Polo, Marco Polo\u2019s father and uncle, might have discovered the original statue in the 13th century while visiting the court of Kublai Khan in what is now Beijing.",
      "As traveling merchants, they would have then transported the statue back to their home city of Venice along the famed Silk Road.",
      "Pointing to the fact that the city had not long ago adopted the lion as its emblem, the study suggested that the Polo brothers may have seen a Chinese figure and had the \u201cbrazen idea of readapting the sculpture into a plausible (when viewed from afar) Winged Lion.\u201d",
      "While not enough evidence exists to be sure of this rumored route, experts say the statue\u2019s eastern origins underscore Venice\u2019s longstanding global prowess.",
      "As with so many great trading centers in history, Frankopan said, \u201cthe city\u2019s capacity to absorb and adapt outside influences \u2014 from Byzantine mosaics to Egyptian porphyry \u2026 is what gave it dynamism and resilience.\u201d",
      "In such a global city, he adds, \u201ca Tang dynasty lion fits right in.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "HONG KONG \u2014 What do autocratic leaders talk about when they get together? Maybe how to live forever.",
      "The exchange between Chinese President Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin was caught on a hot mic Wednesday as the duo and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, in their first joint public appearance, led a delegation of 27 world leaders attending a massive military parade in Beijing.",
      "State-run broadcaster CCTV was livestreaming the event, which marked the 80th anniversary of the end of World War II, and providing the feed to other media organizations.",
      "As they ascended the rostrum at Tiananmen Square to watch the parade, Putin and Xi, who are both 72, appeared to be discussing the world\u2019s strides in life expectancy.",
      "While it used to be rare for people to reach age 70, \u201cnow they say that at 70 you are only a child,\u201d a translator for Xi can be heard telling Putin in Russian.",
      "With advances in biotechnology, people will be able to \u201ctransplant human organs continuously, grow younger with age and perhaps even achieve immortality,\u201d Putin\u2019s translator responds in Mandarin.",
      "Xi, who at that point was off-camera, can then be heard saying, \u201cSome have predicted that by the end of this century, humans could potentially live up to 150 years.\u201d",
      "It was unclear whether the conversation was also being translated for Kim, believed to be 41, who was smiling and looking toward the older leaders.",
      "Though they may have just been making conversation, the exchange holds extra weight because both Putin and Xi have indicated an interest in staying in office as long as possible.",
      "Xi, who has been president since 2013, was awarded a rare third term in 2023 after he removed the two-term limit from the constitution five years earlier, breaking with China\u2019s long-standing tradition of changing leaders every decade. In another departure from historical practice, he has not given any sign of who his successor might be.",
      "Putin, who has been president or prime minister of Russia since 2000, won a controversial referendum in 2020 that amended the constitution to allow him to potentially stay in power until 2036. At that point, he would be 83 and Russia\u2019s longest-serving ruler since Peter the Great.",
      "Putin is known for his long-standing interest in longevity, and last year Russian lawmakers established an anti-aging research center called \u201cNew Health Preservation Technologies\u201d after Putin said the nation should focus on preserving the health of its citizens.",
      "Though Xi does not appear to have the same fixation, Chinese leaders tend to enjoy long lives, with Deng Xiaoping living until 92 and his successor, Jiang Zemin, making it to 96.",
      "Organ transplants are a sensitive subject in China, where rights groups say organs may still be harvested from executed prisoners even after the government pledged to end the controversial practice in 2014. China has long struggled with a shortage of donated organs because of cultural taboos, and in 2023 the government issued new rules tightening regulation and promoting public awareness.",
      "There was little discussion of the two leaders\u2019 impromptu exchange on Chinese social media, which is heavily censored.",
      "Putin confirmed the conversation with Xi when reporters asked about it later Wednesday, saying, \u201cOh, I believe the chairman talked about it when we were going to the parade.\u201d",
      "\u201cModern means, both health improvement, and medical means and even all kinds of surgical ones related to organ replacement, allow humanity to hope that active life will continue not as it does today,\u201d he said.",
      "He also appeared to refer to United Nations estimates that by 2050 there will be more than twice as many people over 60 as children under 5.",
      "\u201cThis will have social, political and economic consequences,\u201d he said. \u201cWe should certainly think about this, too, when we talk about life expectancy.\u201d"

Jacques Goudstikker, a Jewish art dealer, died in 1940 while fleeing the Nazis,\u201d the Cultural Heritage Agency of the Netherlands told NBC News in a written statement.",

      "On Wednesday, the portrait of the countess, in a flower-embroidered dress and in a golden frame, was sitting in a nearby federal prosecutor\u2019s office.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re doing this simply so that the community to whom we partly owe the discovery of the work ... can see these images,\u201d the prosecutor, Daniel Adler, said, according to The Associated Press. \u201cIt was people from the community, specifically journalists, who prompted the investigation,\u201d he added.",

      "After coming across the image of the painting, the journalists contacted Friedrich Kadgien's daughter, Patricia Kadgien, but did not receive a response for weeks, according to their report in AD.",
      "The image of the painting was soon replaced with an image of a tapestry, and an initial raid by Argentinian authorities on the family home did not find the artwork.",
      "But prosecutors carried out four raids at different locations that belonged to the Kadgien family this week and both Patricia Kadgien and her husband, Juan Carlos Cortegoso, were placed under house arrest, pending a formal hearing Thursday on charges of concealment and obstruction of justice.",
      "Adler, the prosecutor, told reporters that the couple\u2019s lawyer had handed over the painting to authorities Wednesday. He did not specify where the portrait would go next.",
      "\u201cMy search for the artwork of my father-in-law, Jacques Goudstikker, began in the late 1990s and I have not given up to this day,\u201d Goudstikker\u2019s daughter-in-law Marei von Saher told AD. \u201cIt is my family\u2019s goal to recover every artwork stolen from the Goudstikker collection and to restore Jacques\u2019 legacy.\u201d"

      "During their meeting at the Great Hall of the People, the two leaders also discussed strengthening strategic cooperation, defending common interests in international and regional affairs and conducting more high-level visits, Chinese and North Korean state media reported. The meeting was followed by a small-group tea meeting and banquet.",
      "KCNA confirmed Friday that Kim had arrived home from Beijing on his private train, saying he was seen off at Beijing Railway Station by Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi and other senior Chinese officials.",
      "The agency said the North Korean leader\u2019s visit to China was \u201ca historic occasion which further strengthened the political trust and strategic cooperation\u201d between the two countries and \u201cshowed the invariability and invincibility\u201d of their relations, which have overcome \u201call sorts of trials and challenges.\u201d",
      "By stressing the unchanging nature of their relationship despite international shifts, \u201cthe summit also gave North Korea grounds to justify holding on to its nuclear weapons,\u201d Lim said. \u201cWith China voicing support for Pyongyang\u2019s own \u2018core interests,\u2019 Beijing can be seen as tacitly acknowledging North Korea\u2019s status as a nuclear-armed state.\u201d",
      "But China, which prefers stability on the Korean Peninsula, could still play a positive role as mediator, he said.",
      "\u201cChina may well use economic cooperation as leverage to press Pyongyang to ease tensions in the interest of regional stability,\u201d Lim said.",
      "While Xi and Kim did not mention a possible U.S.-North Korea summit, their references to strengthening cooperation, high-level exchanges and strategic communication \u201csuggest that close consultations between Beijing and Pyongyang are to be expected before any such summit is pursued,\u201d said Yang Moo-jin, distinguished chair professor at the University of North Korean Studies in Seoul, South Korea.",
      "He said a U.S.-North Korea summit was unlikely in the near future.",
      "North Korea will first try to gain leverage by securing \u201ca support base from countries that are recognized nuclear powers, with China as its backing,\u201d Yang said.",

      "An actual halt in fighting seems an increasingly distant ambition, with President Donald Trump \u2014 who called into the meeting \u2014 having said that he remained hopeful but that the two sides were clearly \u201cnot ready yet\u201d to make a deal.",
      "\u201cTrump emphasized that Europe must stop purchasing Russian oil that is funding the war,\" a White House official told NBC News on Thursday after Trump spoke to European leaders. The official added that he also told the leaders they had to \u201cplace economic pressure on China for funding Russia\u2019s war efforts.\u201d",
      "Russian President Vladimir Putin said Wednesday during a visit to Beijing that he will end the war by force if Ukraine does not agree to his demands. He suggested he would meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, but only in Moscow.",

      "The security guarantees \"must be strong and effective\u2014in the air, at sea, and on land,\" he said in a statement. \"The war launched by Russia must be stopped. President Trump\u2019s principle of \u2018peace through strength\u2019 is exactly the kind of approach that can influence the aggressor.\"",
      "For Trump, the war is proving harder to resolve than his onetime claim that he would be able to fix the situation in 24 hours. He has increasingly expressed disappointment and even anger toward Putin but has repeatedly stopped short of imposing new sanctions against Moscow despite numerous threats.",
      "After his push for a meeting between Putin and Zelenskyy appeared to have fallen apart, Trump conceded Wednesday that there was still a chasm between the two leaders.",
      "\u201cSomething is going to happen, but they are not ready yet. But something is going to happen. We are going to get it done,\u201d Trump said in a phone interview with CBS News.",
      "Since the Kremlin's full-scale invasion in February 2022, Ukraine has been bombed nightly by Russian missiles and drones and repeatedly said it is ready to call a ceasefire. Russia has rejected that, maintaining it will not do so until Ukraine has fulfilled a set of demands that resemble surrender.",
      "However, Kyiv is still deeply wary of a ceasefire, warning Russia could use it to rearm, regroup and launch other attacks on Ukraine and neighboring countries in Europe.",
      "That\u2019s why it and other European powers say the much-vaunted but knotty \u201csecurity guarantees\u201d are essential. They could come in the form of European peacekeeper troops being stationed in Ukraine to uphold the ceasefire, although Russia has summarily rejected that idea so far.",

      "\u201cWe have tapes of them speaking,\u201d Trump said. \u201cIt was massive amounts of drugs coming into our country to kill a lot of people.\u201d",
      "Though the president\u2019s specific intentions regarding Maduro are unclear, the U.S. seems to have two objectives: stemming the flow of illegal drugs from Venezuela and placing debilitating pressure on the Venezuelan leader.",

      "The source familiar with the administration\u2019s thinking believes regime change in Venezuela has been Rubio\u2019s goal. The administration is preparing for this by not recognizing Maduro as a legitimate president, accusing him of rigging elections and  alleging he\u2019s a narco-terrorist, the head of the Cartel de Los Soles. Several weeks ago, the U.S. doubled its reward for information leading to Maduro\u2019s arrest to $50 million.",
      "The source familiar with the administration\u2019s thinking said the U.S. hopes that ramping up pressure on Maduro may prompt finger-pointing inside Venezuela and lead cartel bosses inside and outside the country to blame Maduro and force him out. The source speculated that Russia \u2014 not wanting to get involved in a domestic power struggle \u2014 would pull its financial, diplomatic and military support from Venezuela, long considered its ally.",
      "Tuesday\u2019s military strike on the alleged drug smuggling boat, which Trump said killed 11 people and did not hurt U.S. forces, came as a surprise to many members of Congress.",
      "Democrats, even those in leadership positions on relevant oversight committees, have not been provided with any information about the strike, according to multiple congressional officials with direct knowledge of the situation. It\u2019s not clear what information, if any, Republicans were given before or after the strike.",
      "Rubio defended the strike on Wednesday while visiting Mexico, arguing that the typical interdiction procedures that the U.S. Coast Guard conducts to arrest drug smugglers didn\u2019t work in these cases.",
      "\u201cThese drug cartels, what they do is they know they\u2019re going to lose 2% of their cargo,\u201d Rubio said. \u201cThey bake it into their economics. What will stop them is when you blow them up.\u201d",
      "Additional U.S. military forces",
      "Last month, the U.S. began sending more military resources, including three guided-missile destroyers, to the southern Caribbean. Stephen Donehoo, a former military intelligence officer specializing in Latin America, told NBC News the deployment was enormous.",
      "\u201cI haven\u2019t seen this much U.S. naval military force in the Caribbean under the command of the Southern Command in decades,\u201d Donehoo said. \u201cAll these ships have intelligence systems, and they are also armed to carry out this type of attack if necessary.\u201d",

      "In comments broadcast on Venezuelan state television Tuesday night, Maduro referred to what he considered Rubio\u2019s significant power within the Trump administration regarding Venezuela policy.",
      "\u201cThe youth of the United States do not believe the lies of the big shot in the White House, Marco Rubio,\" Maduro said. \"Because who runs the White House is Marco Rubio \u2014 the mafia of Miami \u2014 who wants to fill Donald Trump\u2019s hands with blood.\u201d",

That gave the White House new legal authorities to take military action against such groups throughout the Western Hemisphere.",

      "\u201cIt is a criminal enterprise \u2014 all the way to the various cartels that operate in Mexico, and in between,\u201d Rubio said. \u201cSo, what it changes is it gives us legal authorities to target them in ways you can\u2019t do if they\u2019re just a bunch of criminals. It\u2019s no longer a law enforcement issue. It becomes a national security issue.\u201d",

    "published": "Thu, 04 Sep 2025 02:10:22 GMT",
    "summary": "A federal appeals court ruled that the president does not have the authority to set sweeping tariffs under the emergency-powers law he invoked.",
    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 The Trump administration asked the Supreme Court on Wednesday to quickly decide whether he has the power to impose broad tariffs under a law designed for use during times of emergency.",
      "The Justice Department is appealing a ruling by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit on Friday that President Donald Trump had exceeded his authority, the filings said.",
      "The filings, shared by the Justice Department and the challengers, have not yet been officially docketed by the Supreme Court.",
      "Jeffrey Schwab, a lawyer for the Liberty Justice Center \u2014 which is representing businesses challenging the tariffs \u2014 said in a statement he was confident the court would rule against Trump.",
      "\u201cThese unlawful tariffs are inflicting serious harm on small businesses and jeopardizing their survival. We hope for a prompt resolution of this case for our clients,\u201d he added.",
      "The appeals court, divided 7-4, said the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, which allows the president to regulate imports when there is a national emergency, does not give sweeping powers to impose global tariffs of unspecified duration.",
      "The tariffs are in effect and will remain in place until at least Oct. 14 under the appeals court ruling.",
      "The administration submitted two filings: an appeal and a motion to expedite.",
      "In the latter, Solicitor General D. John Sauer asked the justices to fast-track consideration of the case so oral arguments can be heard as soon as the first week of November. That would require the court to decide by next week whether to hear the case.",
      "The challengers have agreed to that timeline, a Liberty Justice Center spokesman said.",
      "The appeals court's \"erroneous decision has disrupted highly impactful, sensitive, ongoing diplomatic trade negotiations, and cast a pall of legal uncertainty over the President\u2019s efforts to protect our country by preventing an unprecedented economic and foreign-policy crisis,\" Sauer wrote.",
      "The filings included a declaration by Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent citing the importance of a quick ruling.",
      "\"Swift review of that decision is necessary to avoid derailing critical ongoing negotiations with our foreign trading partners and threatening broader U.S. strategic interests internationally,\" he wrote.",
      "The high court has a 6-3 conservative majority, including three Trump appointees. Although it has frequently ruled in favor of Trump in the first few months of his term, some legal experts believe it may be more skeptical about his tariff powers.",
      "During the Biden administration, the court was skeptical of the White House\u2019s moves to seek broad powers via laws enacted by Congress that did not explicitly authorize them. In one significant example, the court, endorsing what has been dubbed the \"major questions doctrine,\" ruled against President Joe Biden's plan to forgive student loan debt.",
      "The case under appeal affects two sets of tariffs Trump has imposed. The first are the country-by-country or \u201creciprocal\u201d tariffs, which now range from 34% for China to a 10% baseline for the rest of the world. The second is a 25% tariff Trump imposed on some goods from Canada, China and Mexico for what the administration said was their failure to curb the flow of fentanyl.",
      "Other tariffs implemented under other laws, such as 50% steel and aluminum tariffs on all other worldwide trading partners, were implemented under other statutes not at issue in the case.",
      "Even if Trump loses at the Supreme Court, he has other avenues to impose additional tariffs.",
      "V.O.S. Selections Inc., a wine and spirits importer, and Plastic Services and Products, a pipe and fittings company, are among five businesses that sued Trump over his use of the emergency law. Twelve states also challenged the move.",
      "The Court of International Trade initially blocked the tariffs in late May, prompting the Trump administration to appeal.",
      "Trump has long sought to raise revenue by taxing imported goods, which he believes will revitalize manufacturing in the United States. While the tariffs are bringing in billions of dollars in revenue, economists say they are slowing U.S. economic growth, while inflation has also ticked up."
