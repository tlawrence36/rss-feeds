      "President Donald Trump is hosting the 2025 Kennedy Center honorees in the Oval Office for a medal presentation ceremony",
      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump on Saturday was hosting the 2025 Kennedy Center honorees in the Oval Office for what the White House described as a medal presentation ceremony.",
      "This year's recipients are actor Sylvester Stallone, singers Gloria Gaynor and George Strait, the rock band Kiss and actor-singer Michael Crawford.",
      "Trump ignored the Kennedy Center and its premier awards program during his first term as president. But the Republican president instituted a series of changes since returning to office in January, most notably ousting its board of trustees and replacing them with GOP supporters who voted him in as chairman.",
      "Trump also has criticized the center's programming and its physical appearance, and vowed to overhaul both.",
      "The president said in August that he was \u201cabout 98% involved\u201d in choosing the 2025 honorees when he personally announced them at the Kennedy Center, the first slate chosen under his leadership. The honorees traditionally had been announced by press release.",
      "It was unclear how they were chosen. Before Trump, it fell to a bipartisan selection committee.",

      "Later Saturday, after the Oval Office event, Trump was scheduled to attend an annual State Department dinner for the honorees. In years past, the honorees would receive their medallions at the dinner but it appeared that Trump has moved the ceremony to the White House.",
      "Meanwhile, the glitzy Kennedy Center Honors program and its series of tribute performances for each recipient is set to be taped on Sunday at the performing arts center for broadcast later in December on CBS and Paramount+. Trump is to attend the program for the first time as president, accompanied by his wife, first lady Melania Trump.",
      "The president said in August that he would host the show, but the White House has not characterized his level of participation. Presidents traditionally attend the program and sit with the honorees in the audience. None has ever served as host.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve been asked to host. I said, \u2018I\u2019m the president of the United States. Are you fools asking me to do that?'\u201d Trump said back then. \u201cAnd then Susie Wiles said to me, \u2018Sir, I\u2019d like you to host.' I said, OK, Susie, I\u2019ll do it,\u201d Trump said, referring to his White House chief of staff.",
      "Trump spent several hours at the Kennedy Center on Friday. He participated in the FIFA World Cup draw for 2026 and accepted its inaugural peace prize. Trump also met in a group with the leaders of Canada and Mexico.",

      "Built in stone or adobe structures, each bath could hold dozens of people and produced steam by heating stones before dousing them with water.",

      "Most of them were located near ceremonial ballcourts, underscoring their connection to the game\u2019s ritual dimension.",

      "DETROIT -- RoboCop has finally found a permanent home in Detroit.",
      "A statue looming 11 feet tall (3.3 meters) and weighing 3,500 pounds (1,587 kilograms) has been drawing fans since it began standing guard over the Motor City on Wednesday afternoon, after about 15 years in the making. Even in a snowstorm in the dark, people were driving by to see it, said Jim Toscano, co-owner of the FREE AGE film production company where the bronze-cast statue now stands bolted near the sidewalk.",
      "\u201cRoboCop\u201d hit theaters in 1987, portraying a near-future Detroit as crime-ridden and poorly protected by a beleaguered and outgunned police force, until actor Peter Weller appeared as a nearly invincible cyborg, created by a nefarious corporation bent on privatizing policing.",
      "There was a time when Detroit pushed back on anything pointing to its past reputation as an unsafe city, and the movie, which developed a cult following, spawning two sequels and a reboot, didn't help its image.",
      "But things have changed. Violent crime has been trending down for years. Homicide numbers have dropped below mid-1960s levels. And city officials offered no objections to the statue's installation, Toscano said.",
      "\u201cI think there will be a lot more acceptance,\u201d Toscano said. \u201cDetroit has come a long way. You put in a little nostalgia and that helps.\u201d",
      "The statue campaign appears to have started around 2010 when Detroit Mayor Dave Bing was tagged in a tweet that noted Philadelphia's statue of boxer Rocky Balboa and said RoboCop would be a \u201cGREAT ambassador for Detroit.\u201d",
      "Bing tweeted back, saying there were no such plans. But some Detroiters ran with the idea, crowdfunding it through a 2012 Kickstarter campaig n that raised more than $67,000 from more than 2,700 backers worldwide, and Detroit sculptor Giorgio Gikas finished the statue in 2017.",
      "Then, it got stuck, stored away from public view.",
      "The Michigan Science Center in Detroit ultimately nixed plans to host the sculpture in 2021, citing pressures from the coronavirus pandemic and the need to focus museum resources. Officials in Stevens Point, Wisconsin raised their hands, hoping to honor Weller, a native son of that city, by erecting it outside the police station or in a park.",
      "The search for a suitable home for RoboCop remained in limbo until about three years ago when Toscano's company bought a building in Eastern Market, an open-air produce market, shopping and entertainment district just northeast of downtown. Toscano says he thought they were \u201ckidding\u201d when he was contacted by the creator of the statue idea and Eastern Market officials. But he and his business partner gladly came on board: \u201cIt's too unusual, too unique, too cool not to do,\u201d Toscano said.",

      "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- For Googoosh, Iran's most-famous singer, life always has been balancing act of one kind or another.",
      "It began as a child, performing with her acrobat father who balanced her on a chair atop another chair resting only on his chin. Then later, as an icon of stage and screen during the last years of the shah, her looks and hairstyles were copied by Iranian women who wanted to look more \u201cGoogooshi,\" a Farsi adjective all her own.",
      "Then came the decades of silence after Iran's 1979 Islamic Revolution, barred from performing, only to return to the stage abroad in 2000. And now, embarking on a farewell tour, she's adding author as her latest reinvention as her homeland undergoes a societal change yet again.",
      "\u201cI did not realize that all these challenges and struggles were considered a balancing act,\" the 75-year-old singer told The Associated Press. \"If that is what it means, then yes, I have spent my entire life trying to create and maintain a balance between my personal life and my artistic life.\u201d",
      "The new book by the singer, born Faegheh Atashin, is called \u201cGoogoosh: A Sinful Voice.\u201d In it, Googoosh with the help of co-author Tara Dehlavi recounts a life shaped by both the political forces that have changed Iran in the modern era and her tumultuous personal life.",
      "But it all began with performing at an early age with her father, Saber Atashin, to whom the book is dedicated along with the people of Iran. Googoosh recounts falling only once in the shows, her father catching her. But from the first performance atop the chair, Googoosh appeared bound for the spotlight.",
      "\u201cThey held their breath and waited in complete silence,\u201d she recounted. \u201cEvery muscle in my body tensed. Seconds felt like an eternity. Finally, Papa slowly began to lower me gently toward the ground. When my feet touched the floor, the audience sighed in relief before they erupted into roaring applause. I had survived. And we were a hit!\u201d",
      "Googoosh began singing and performing in films at a young age. That included before the royal court of Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who later became mortally ill and fled Iran just before the 1979 revolution.",
      "Googoosh had been tabloid fodder in Iran before the revolution. Married four times in her life, her personal life long had been a fascination. And within her book, she recounts undergoing abortions and battling with substance abuse around and after the revolution, including freebasing cocaine and smoking opium. She considers suicide at one point in New York City before deciding to go back to Iran under its newly formed theocracy.",
      "\u201cThere were times where I would ask this question to you and say, \u2018Are you sure you want to share this?\u2019\" Dehlavi, her co-author said. \"And you always said that, \u2018I\u2019m either I\u2019m telling my story or I\u2019m not. I have to I have to tell it all.\u2019\u201d",
      "Returning to Iran, Googoosh found herself harassed by its newly empowered theocracy, which put a lien on her home and blocked her ability to be issued a passport. Authorities banned her from performing or singing, she recounted, and at one point imprisoned her",
      "But she describes while trying to hide her identity in public or in private, people always pushed her to sing again, to find her voice despite the restrictions and threats.",

I did not want that life. I hoped I could somehow continue performing for my own people, inside my own country.\u201d",
      "Ultimately though, in 2000 under the government of reformist President Mohammad Khatami, Googoosh was able to get a contract to perform abroad, pull the money together to pay off her liens, obtain a passport and leave Iran. She never returned, but has performed abroad for the last 25 years for Iranians who similarly are homesick for their country.",
      "Islamic hard-liners within Iran still denounce her, particularly after 2014 music video about homosexual love, punishable by death in the country.",
      "Googoosh's new book and her farewell tour come at a time of change in Iran. More and more, Iranian women choose to forgo the country\u2019s mandatory headscarf, or hijab. The 2022 death of Mahsa Amini and the nationwide protests that followed enraged women of all ages and views in a way few other issues have since the revolution.",
      "But meanwhile, Iran's economy continues to strain under international sanctions over its nuclear program. Its theocracy continues to execute people in the wake of the 12-day war with Israel, while also increasingly targeting intellectuals and others with arrest.",
      "\u201cWe are seeing our youth, especially women, fighting for their most basic rights, including choosing what to wear, expressing their art freely if they have artistic talent, and living a normal life like people in other parts of the world,\u201d Googoosh said.",

Our young people grew old without ever enjoying their youth. Our people must end this painful cycle and gain the freedoms every human being deserves.\u201d",

      "While its lilting sound brings images of the Caribbean to mind, it was the kind of music that attracted mostly elderly people in Trinidad and Tobago \u2014 until recently.",
      "\u201cThat has been changing rapidly,\u201d said Amrit Samaroo, son of Jit Samaroo, a legendary steelpan music arranger, player and composer.",
      "The steelpan \u2014 or pan, for short \u2014 is \u201csexy again,\u201d he told The Associated Press on a recent afternoon as he sat in the living room of his family\u2019s home surrounded by a piano, a tenor steelpan and photos of his late father.",
      "Amrit Samaroo, who leads the popular Trinidad and Tobago\u2019s Supernovas Steel Orchestra, has witnessed the demographic change firsthand. He notes that social media is embracing the instrument, with fans playing everything from pop songs to reggae on steelpans.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s good to have that type of recognizable material played on the instrument,\u201d Samaroo said. \u201cIt\u2019s a nice space we are in right now.\u201d",
      "Pannists, as the players are known, boast about the steelpan being able to belt out any genre of music. Add the influence of whatever is trending, and you get an instrument that\u2019s growing its fanbase at a rapid pace.",
      "\u201cPan is an out-of-body experience, that\u2019s the best way I can describe it,\u201d said 17-year-old student Jael Grant.",
      "She has been playing since age 5 and is now a member of the Exodus Steel Orchestra, a band that her grandfather has supported for decades.",

      "But former slaves would not be silenced, and that led to them discovering the hidden musical instrument in discarded oil drums.",
      "\u201cReally, a spirit of a people\u2026went into this and came out, from African roots to now global acceptance,\u201d Amrit Samaroo said.",
      "Steelpan manufacturers no longer have to wait for discarded drums to make the pan, which only officially became the national instrument of Trinidad and Tobago in July 2024.",
      "Technology is changing how the instrument is made, which is contributing to its revival.",

      "Designer Matthieu Blazy has taken Chanel's fashions underground, with a runway show on a New York City subway platform",
      "NEW YORK -- Chanel\u2019s new showman, Matthieu Blazy, took his designs on the road Tuesday \u2014 or rather, underground, with a buzzy New York runway show staged on an actual subway platform.",
      "The designer, just weeks after his splashy Paris debut for Chanel in October, took over a decommissioned part of Manhattan's Bowery station for his first M\u00e9tiers d\u2019Art collection. The annual show, which takes place in a different city each year, celebrates the craftsmanship of the artisans that partner with Chanel.",
      "In this case, it was two shows \u2014 one in the afternoon and one in the evening. And befitting the first Chanel shows in New York since 2018, there were VIPs aplenty: A$AP Rocky, Tilda Swinton, Ayo Edebiri, Rose Byrne, Kristen Stewart, Sofia Coppola, Lupita Nyong\u2019o, Jessie Buckley, Margaret Qualley, Bowen Yang, Jon Bon Jovi and many others.",
      "The location had been a closely held secret. Guests entered via a doorway at 168 Bowery, and at first, it seemed like Chanel had perhaps decorated an event space to resemble a subway station, complete with tiled walls, turnstiles and a newsstand (with its own bespoke newspapers).",
      "But down a flight of stairs was the real platform. Guests settled into bleacher seats resembling subway benches. \u201cStand clear of the closing doors!\u201d came the announcement on the soundtrack, familiar to New Yorkers. Then a train came rolling in, and out of the cars came the models.",
      "The show was a marked contrast in vibe with the last M\u00e9tiers d\u2019Art collection in New York in 2018, when the late designer Karl Lagerfeld took over the Egyptian Temple of Dendur at the Metropolitan Museum of Art for what felt like a mini-Met Gala, with clothes channeling the luxury of Egyptian royalty.",
      "Blazy was inspired not by royalty but by ordinary urban commuters, of different ages and types, coming together in a mashup of styles from different eras, from the 1920s onward.",
      "\u201cThe New York subway belongs to all,\u201d the designer said in his show notes. \"Everyone uses it. There are students and game-changers, statesmen and teenagers. It is a place full of wonderful encounters, a clash of pop archetypes.\u201d",
      "His models strolled the platform, some checking for arriving trains \u2014 feigning annoyance at their lateness \u2014 or leaning against a post as they waited. Their numbers increased until, by the end, there was a virtual rush hour of fashion, with the eclectic soundtrack playing the \u201cHappy Days\u201d theme song as a finale.",

      "Stewart, like others, had no idea going in what the show\u2019s theme would be, and thought the subway environment felt like \u201ca flurry of fleeting caught moments.\u201d",
      "\u201cLike, \u2018Where is she going?\u2019 I wanted to go with them,\u201d Stewart said. \u201cI believed in it. All of this is artifice, but when you do a really good impression of the truth, you find your own. This felt real to me.\u201d",
      "It was real enough that Chanel had printed its own \u201cnewspaper\u201d \u2014 called La Gazette \u2014 to accompany the show, with articles and interviews. An interview with Blazy quoted the designer as saying the collection was inspired partly by the 1931 visit to New York of Gabrielle \u201cCoco\u201d Chanel.",

      "NEW YORK -- If there were any doubt, the first few days of Hollywood's year-end awards has already made it abundantly clear: Paul Thomas Anderson's \u201cOne Battle After Another\u201d is the Oscar front-runner.",
      "On Monday, \u201cOne Battle After Another\u201d won best film at the 35th Gotham Awards. On Tuesday, it was named best film by the New York Film Critics Circle. On Wednesday, it swept the National Board of Review Awards, winning best film, best director for Anderson and acting awards for Leonardo DiCaprio, Benicio del Toro and newcomer Chase Infiniti.",
      "Expect to hear this pun a lot: one award after another.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t expect this, actually,\u201d Anderson said at the Gothams. \u201cI started to think I didn\u2019t know what was going on.\u201d",
      "That may be the first, and last, time Anderson can say that this awards season.",
      "\u201cOne Battle After Another,\u201d a father-daughter tale of political resistance in the face of recurring oppression, has firmly established itself as the movie of the moment. With an opening scene depicting a raid at an immigrant detention facility, Anderson's opus has struck critics and moviegoers, alike, for its contemporary relevance in the first year of President Donald Trump's second term. Even foes of the film, like conservative commentator Ben Shapiro, have predicted it will \u201cwin all the Academy Awards.\u201d",
      "Yet Anderson's film is, in many ways, an Academy Awards oddity. It's a critically acclaimed release that skipped film festivals. It's a big-budget studio movie that wasn't a hit. In fact, should \u201cOne Battle After Another\u201d go on to win at the March 15 Oscars, it could be one of the only money-losers to ever win the industry's top honor.",
      "Smaller films have, increasingly, won best picture. That includes indies like \u201cThe Hurt Locker,\u201d \u201cMoonlight\u201d and \u201cNomadland\u201d \u2014 much-praised films with minuscule box office. Hollywood long ago got used to honoring films that exist largely outside its mainstream, franchise-obsessed business. And the notion of what constitutes a best-picture movie has grown elastic. \u201cParasite,\u201d\u201cEverything Everywhere All at Once\u201d and, the most recent winner, \u201cAnora,\u201d have all shaken traditional notions of Oscar material.",

      "\u201cOne Battle After Another\u201d represents something different. With a production budget of at least $130 million (some reports have it much higher) and another $70 million in marketing costs, it will have to have an extraordinary after-theater life to break even. Thus far, the Warner Bros. release has made $70.6 million domestically and $131.6 million overseas \u2014 great sums for an adult-oriented, R-rated, auteur-driven film that runs nearly three hours.",
      "Still, Variety earlier estimated \u201cOne Battle After Another\u201d will lose $100 million, a figure that Warner Bros. has disputed. It's too harsh a label, but such a discrepancy could make \u201cOne Battle After Another\u201d tagged as the first best picture-winning flop.",
      "Awards season has a long way to go. None of the awards dished out this week has any direct correlation with academy voters. Some contenders, like A24's \u201cMarty Supreme,\u201d have yet to hit theaters. Others, like Focus Features' \u201cHamnet,\u201d are just arriving. Support is also strong for another Warner Bros. title, Ryan Coogler's \u201cSinners,\u201d which might pose the stiffest competition for \u201cOne Battle After Another.\u201d Both films are returning to IMAX screens on Dec. 12.",
      "But a bottom line in the red is far from a unique cross to bear this fall. Aside from the blockbuster launches of \u201cZootopia 2\u201d and \u201cWicked: For Good,\u201d waves of would-be awards contenders \u2014 films like \u201cThe Smashing Machine,\u201d \u201cRoofman\u201d and \u201cChristy\u201d\u2014 have fizzled with ticket buyers. It's been a grueling fall for a wide spectrum of contenders, a context that makes \u201cOne Battle After Another,\u201d comparatively, a smash success.",
      "The biggest financial ding against it, really, is that it cost a lot \u2014 arguably too much \u2014 to make. At a time when so few films anything like \u201cOne Battle After Another\u201d get greenlit, let alone with such budgets, the cost of \u201cOne Battle After Another\u201d could even be seen as a badge of honor. Here is a movie that win, lose or draw, is in the fight for a kind of moviemaking that's under siege. To quote DiCaprio's Bob Ferguson: \u201cViva la revolution!\u201d",

      "In the caption for the clip, the White House quoted Carpenter\u2019s lyrics, \u201cHave you ever tried this one? Bye-bye.\u201d",

Hegseth posted the image with the caption \u201cFranklin Targets Narco Terrorists.\u201d",

      "The reggaet\u00f3n-and-then-some artist was 2025\u2019s most-streamed artist globally, having earned more than 19.8 billion streams. He is followed by Swift, The Weeknd, Drake and Billie Eilish, in that order.",
      "For the last two years, Swift has commanded the top spot, globally \u2014 claiming it in 2023 and holding it for 2024 \u2014 having dethroned Bad Bunny. He held the coveted title for three years in a row beginning in 2020. Now, he's back on top.",
      "In the U.S., the most-streamed artist list looks somewhat similar: There, Swift leads, followed by Drake, Morgan Wallen and Kendrick Lamar. Bad Bunny is in the fifth spot.",
      "The most-streamed album globally was, of course, Bad Bunny\u2019s \u201cDeb\u00ed Tirar M\u00e1s Fotos\u201d followed by the \u201cKPop Demon Hunters\u201d soundtrack and three releases from 2024: Billie Eilish's \u201cHit Me Hard and Soft,\u201d SZA's \u201cSOS Deluxe: LANA\u201d and Sabrina Carpenter's \u201cShort n' Sweet,\u201d in that order.",
      "In the U.S., it differs slightly. The most-streamed album is Wallen's \u201cI'm The Problem,\u201d followed by SZA, Bad Bunny, the \u201cKPop Demon Hunters\u201d soundtrack and Lamar's \u201cGNX.\u201d",
      "Globally, the most-streamed song title goes to Bruno Mars and Lady Gaga's collaboration, \u201cDie with a Smile,\u201d which has racked up over 1.7 billion streams.

      "The Kennedy Center, known for theater and opera, becomes the sports world's focus on Friday",
      "WASHINGTON -- On Friday afternoon, the Kennedy Center, best known for its theater, opera and ballet, will be the unlikely center of the sports world when the matchups for next year's World Cup are announced there. By Sunday, in a quick pivot, the venue will assume its more traditional role as the host of the annual awards program honoring some of the top artists in the U.S.",
      "The culture headsnap has one thing in common: President Donald Trump's starring role.",
      "Trump was instrumental in working with FIFA President Gianni Infantino to move the draw to the Kennedy Center after it was widely expected to take place in Las Vegas. FIFA may further recognize Trump at the event with a newly created peace prize. Infantino hasn't confirmed that Trump will be the recipient but the two have forged a notably close relationship and Trump has openly campaigned for the Nobel Peace Prize. On the same day last month that FIFA said it would issue the new award, Infantino called Trump a \u201cclose friend\" who has \u201csuch an incredible energy.\u201d",
      "If the prospect of a peace prize isn't enough attention, Trump will assume a role played in the past by the broadcasting legend Walter Cronkite and other luminaires by hosting the Kennedy Center Honors, if current plans hold. When Trump announced the honorees at the Kennedy Center in August, he cast himself as reluctantly taking on the duties at the request of his chief of staff.",
      "\u201cI've been asked to host,\u201d he said. \u201cI said, I\u2019m the President of the United States. Are you fools asking me to do that? Sir, you\u2019ll get much higher ratings. I said 'I don\u2019t care.\u201d",
      "There are few recent parallels to the fervor that's about to descend on the Kennedy Center. When the U.S. last hosted the World Cup in 1994, the draw was held in Las Vegas and Bill Clinton, the president at the time, didn't attend. When presidents participate in the Kennedy Center Honors \u2014 Trump skipped the event during his first term \u2014 they generally stay in their box, wave to the audience and cheer the honorees.",
      "This week's lineup is a reminder that for Trump \u2014 a two-term president, bestselling author and onetime reality television star \u2014 his favorite role is that of a showman. And Trump's transformation of the Kennedy Center from one of Washington's relatively apolitical spaces into something of an extension of his White House affords him a natural stage.",
      "The shift at the Kennedy Center began quickly after Trump's return to Washington in late January. Within a month, he ousted the institution\u2019s leadership, filled the board of trustees with his supporters and announced he had been elected the board\u2019s chair.",
      "Trump and his aides criticized the Kennedy Center's programming as \u201cwoke\" and accused the previous leadership of financial mismanagement and neglecting the building. Some renovations have been underway in recent weeks, including using white paint over columns that were previously gold.",
      "Deborah Rutter, who was fired as the Kennedy Center's president, said in a May statement that allegations of poor financial management were \u201cfalse\u201d and insisted that when she left, \u201cthe Kennedy Center was fiscally sound.\u201d",
      "But the fallout has been intense with prominent musicals such as \u201cHamilton\u201d canceling performances. Actor Issa Rae and author Louise Penny also withdrew from appearances while consultants such as musician Ben Folds and singer Ren\u00e9e Fleming resigned. Some artists have expressed a sense of sadness at the changes.",
      "\u201cIt was always a joy to be asked to perform at the Kennedy Center,\u201d Jane Alexander, an actor and former chair of the National Endowment for the Arts, told The Associated Press.",
      "For its part, the Kennedy Center's new leadership has said it is focusing on programming that appeals to a broad audience and doesn't lose money. Kennedy Center President Richard Grenell has emphasized \u201ccommon sense\u201d programming.",
      "But Democrats in Congress are scrutinizing whether the new management is ultimately costing the Kennedy Center money. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, the top Democrat on the Environment and Public Works Committee, released documents last month showing the Kennedy Center entered into an agreement giving FIFA \u201cexclusive\u201d use of the facility from Nov. 24 through Dec. 12 at no cost, arguing that the venue was at risk of losing millions in potential revenue because of the arrangement.",

In a response to Whitehouse, Grenell said he has raised $117 million this year.",
      "The notion that the Kennedy Center would end up in a spat with Congress would have been unheard of just a few years ago. The venue's history is rooted in bipartisan cooperation when Republican President Dwight Eisenhower worked with Democrats who controlled Congress at the time to pass legislation that would create a national cultural center.",
      "Since then, the facility that would become the Kennedy Center became a place where political differences were mostly put on pause. Supreme Court Justices Antonin Scalia and Ruth Bader Ginsburg \u2014 ideological opposites \u2014 famously attended the opera together.",
      "The Kennedy Center Honors, which were established in 1978, have recognized a broad range of artists and, until Trump\u2019s first term, presidents of both political parties attended the ceremony.",

      "The recipients are typically chosen by a bipartisan commission, though Trump said this year he was \u201cabout 98%\u201d involved in the selections. Some of the 2025 winners have a history of backing Trump, including \u201cRocky\u201d actor Sylvester Stallone, who has called Trump \u201cthe second George Washington\u201d and founding Kiss member Ace Frehley, who endorsed Trump in 2020, calling him \u201cthe strongest leader we\u2019ve got.\u201d",
      "But some Trump detractors will also be recognized, including Kiss musician Paul Stanley. And though singer Gloria Gaynor hasn't publicly criticized the president, her 1970s disco hit \u201cI Will Survive\" is both a Trump favorite and an anthem for feminists and the LGBTQ community.",
      "When Las Vegas hosted the draw, Vanessa Williams and James Brown were headliners. FIFA announced late Tuesday that supermodel and television personality Heidi Klum, comedian Kevin Hart and actor Danny Ramirez will be on hand on Friday along with performances by Andrea Bocelli, the Village People, Robbie Williams and Nicole Scherzinger.",
      "The Kennedy Center's big weekend caps what has been a difficult year for Washington as Trump has portrayed the city as crime-ridden even as the violent crime rate is down. The president has deployed the National Guard in the city and two members were shot \u2014 one fatally \u2014 last week just a mile from the Kennedy Center.",
      "Tourism has taken a hit with travel research firm Tourism Economics predicting a 4.3% decline in international visits to Washington in 2025. That's slightly down from an earlier projection, giving local officials hope that events like the draw could leave potential tourists with a better image of the city.",

      "Claire\u2019s grown kids (Felicity Jones, Chlo\u00eb Grace Moretz, Dominic Sessa ) don\u2019t appreciate her efforts. Her husband (Denis Leary) is supportive without being helpful. And she is operating as a one woman show, managing this precious time with her family and trying to keep it all cozy and happy and fun through constant, thankless labor (cooking, cleaning, wrapping, planning). She even looks fabulous on her many, many (too many?) garbage runs. But after one particularly cruel oversight from her family, she takes off from her suburban prison and doesn\u2019t tell anyone. For once, she\u2019s decided to go do something for herself.",
      "Promising though it may seem, \u201cOh. What. Fun\u201d is a movie that does very little with its setup and terrific cast (including the likes of Danielle Brooks, Joan Chen, Maude Apatow, Rose Abdoo and Eva Longoria in almost cameo-sized roles) opting instead for the most generic version of itself.",
      "The movie, streaming Wednesday on Prime Video, begins with a kind of \u201clow point\u201d (for a beautiful, well-off, stay-at-home Texas mom, that is) in which she tells some children in a neighboring car at a gas station to be nicer to their exhausted mother in the front seat. \u201cShe\u2019ll be dead someday,\u201d she says calmly and seriously. She wishes the mother a Merry Christmas, gives the kids a piercing look and then we get the dreaded freeze-frame/record scratch and a voiceover about being entitled to a little outburst around the holidays and a half-hearted rant about how many holiday movies are about men. Already this movie is making this poor woman apologize.",
      "\u201cThey need to make a movie about the true heroes of the holidays: Moms,\u201d Claire says. Sure, yes, preach Claire, even if her exclusions are suspect and her examples need further review. I\u2019m pretty sure \u201cHome Alone\u201d was at least a little bit about the mom, and that \u201cPlanes, Trains and Automobiles\u201d doesn\u2019t deserve the vitriol. Alas, noble intentions aside, \u201cOh. What. Fun.\u201d probably wasn\u2019t what she had in mind.",
      "Director Michael Showalter co-wrote the script with the short story\u2019s author, Chandler Baker and is committed to keeping the proceedings light and breezy (no cancer diagnoses here).

      "NEW YORK -- A high-stakes hearing in the New York murder case against Luigi Mangione continues Thursday, a year to the day after prosecutors say he gunned down UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson.",
      "Mangione, 27, has pleaded not guilty to both state and federal charges. Before any trials get scheduled, his lawyers are trying to preclude the eventual jurors from hearing about his alleged statements to law enforcement officers and items \u2014 including a gun and a notebook \u2014 allegedly seized from his backpack.",
      "The evidence is key to prosecutors' case. They have said that the 9 mm handgun matches the firearm used in the killing, that writings in the notebook laid out Mangione's disdain for health insurers and ideas about killing a CEO at an investor conference, and that he gave Pennsylvania police the same fake name that the alleged gunman used at a New York hostel days before the shooting.",
      "Thompson, 50, was shot from behind as he walked to an investor conference on Dec. 4, 2024. He became UnitedHealthcare's CEO in 2021 and had worked within parent UnitedHealth Group Inc. for 20 years.",

      "They interacted with Mangione for roughly 20 minutes before telling him he had the right to remain silent. The officers asked his name, whether he\u2019d been in New York recently and other questions, including: \u201cWhy are you nervous?\u201d",

About 15 minutes in, they warned him that he was being investigated and would be arrested if he repeated what they'd determined was a fake name.",

      "\u201cWe are going to continue to recommend it because it saves lives,\u201d he said.",
      "Here's a look at the disease, the vaccine and the debate over changing the recommendations.",
      "Hepatitis B is a serious liver infection that for most people lasts less than six months. But for some \u2014 especially infants and children \u2014 it can become a long-lasting problem that can lead to liver failure, liver cancer and scarring called cirrhosis.",
      "In adults, the virus is spread through sex or through sharing needles during injection-drug use.",
      "But it can also be passed from an infected mother to a baby. As many as 90% of infants who contract hepatitis B go on to have chronic infections, meaning their immune systems don't completely clear the virus.",
      "As many as 2.4 million people in the U.S. are estimated to have hepatitis B, and as many as half are unaware they are infected, according to information from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "Dr. Baruch Blumberg, a federal scientist, identified the virus behind the infection in 1965. He won the Nobel Prize for the discovery, which led to tests and vaccines. The first hepatitis B vaccine was licensed in the U.S. in 1981.",
      "For decades, the nation's vaccine guidance has been influenced by a government-appointed panel of experts, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices. Its recommendations have usually been adopted as national guidance that is widely heeded by doctors.",
      "In 1991, the committee recommended an initial dose of hepatitis B vaccine at birth. The guidance was modified a little over the years and currently suggests a dose within 24 hours of birth for all medically stable infants who weigh at least 4.4 pounds (2 kilograms), plus follow-up shots to be given at about 1 month and 6 months.",
      "Why a dose right at birth? Health officials used to rely on screening expectant mothers to find babies that might have been exposed to the virus. But many cases were missed, experts say, because some women weren't tested or test results were incorrect. Also, the virus can live on surfaces for more than seven days at room temperature, so unvaccinated children living with a person with a chronic infection can catch it.",
      "Newborn hepatitis B vaccinations are widely considered to be a public health success story. Over about 30 years, cases among children fell from about 18,000 per year to about 2,200.",
      "A collaboration of public health researchers, the Vaccine Integrity Project, this week released its analysis of more than 400 studies and reports spanning 40 years. The group concluded the birth dose is safe, and is an important reason U.S. pediatric hepatitis B infections have fallen.",

      "Peppered with questions about why a change was necessary, committee member Dr. Robert Malone said: \u201cThe signal that is prompting this is not one of safety. It\u2019s one of trust. ... It\u2019s one of parents uncomfortable with this medical procedure being performed at birth in a rather unilateral fashion without significant informed consent.\"",
      "The committee tabled a vote at the September meeting, but it's slated to be acted on during Thursday's meeting, according to the agenda. Federal officials have not answered questions about exactly how much of a delay is being proposed, or disclosed what research is being used as a basis for such a decision.",
      "Not knowing what the committee is contemplating makes it difficult to guess the potential impact. But some have tried.",
      "This week, public health researchers collaborating with hepatitis-focused advocacy organizations released a report estimating that delaying the birth dose to 2 months could result in at least 1,400 hepatitis B infections in children and 480 deaths. The report \u2014 which has yet to be peer reviewed or published in a medical journal \u2014 estimated the toll would be higher if the first dose was given even later.",
      "But an ACIP change to the recommendation may have limited impact, O'Leary said.",
      "The committee's most direct power comes over what's covered by the government Vaccines for Children program, which pays for shots for uninsured children from low-income families. Hepatitis B shots often have been bundled into the final hospital bill for childbirth. So a new ACIP recommendation likely would not be an economic obstacle for the current practice continuing at many hospitals, he said.",
      "But any change stands to confuse and frighten parents, he added.",

      "Several medical and public health organizations \u2014 and even some state government officials \u2014 have said, in advance of the meeting, that changing the recommendation is a terrible idea. Among them is a recently formed coalition of government leaders from several Northeastern states, which this week issued a statement saying they would continue to urge families to get a birth dose within 24 hours of delivery.",

One seller is Amazon. Another is Alibaba, a sponsor of the International Olympic Committee.",
      "The easy availability of the drugs combined with their hard-to-detect nature is precisely the toxic combination doping regulators and Olympic officials are trying to avoid. With the Milan Cortina Games just two months away, they are hoping to break a string of scandals involving the Russians and Chinese that have disrupted the Games, both summer and winter, since 2014.",
      "Though online pharmaceuticals and supplements have for years been portrayed as a risk by anti-doping authorities, the influx of certain hard-to-detect peptides \u2014 chains of protein-building amino acids marketeed to help with anything from anti-aging to workout recovery to weight and memory loss \u2014 presents a more difficult challenge.",
      "\u201cThese substances have proliferated,\u201d said Oliver Catlin, president of the Anti-Doping Sciences Institute, whose late father, Don, was among the godfathers of antidoping research.",

      "The West Virginia Supreme Court has paused a ruling that allowed parents to use religious beliefs to opt out of required school vaccines for their children",
      "CHARLESTON, W.Va. -- The West Virginia Board of Education on Tuesday reinstated a school vaccination mandate after the state Supreme Court paused a lower court's ruling that allowed parents to cite religious beliefs to opt out of shots required for their children to attend classes.",
      "The Supreme Court earlier Tuesday issued a stay in last week's ruling by Raleigh County Circuit Judge Michael Froble in a class-action lawsuit. In issuing an injunction, Froble said children of families who objected to the state\u2019s compulsory vaccination law on religious grounds would be allowed to attend school and participate in extracurricular sports.",
      "The Supreme Court halted Froble's ruling pending resolution of appeals in the case. In light of that, the board said in a statement that it \u201cis reinstating its directive to county boards of education not to accept religious exemptions to compulsory vaccination laws. This directive will be in effect until the Supreme Court issues further guidance.\u201d",
      "The board further said its priority is to ensure compliance with the vaccine law \u201cand safeguard the health and well-being of all students across West Virginia.\u201d",
      "The board had suspended the vaccine mandate last week after Froble's ruling, which said that a state policy barring parents from seeking religious exemptions violated the Equal Protection for Religion Act signed into law in 2023 by then-Republican Gov. Jim Justice.",
      "West Virginia was among just a handful of states that granted only medical exemptions from school vaccinations when Republican Gov. Patrick Morrisey issued an executive order in January allowing religious exemptions. In June, the board directed public schools to ignore Morrisey's executive order. Two groups had sued over the executive order, saying the Legislature, not the governor, has the authority to make such decisions.",
      "Legislation that would have allowed the religious exemptions was passed by the state Senate and rejected by the House of Delegates earlier this year. Froble said in his ruling that the failure of the legislation did not determine the application of the 2023 law. He rejected the defendants' argument that religious exemptions can only be created by legislative action.",

      "Russia\u2019s Defense Ministry did not respond to AP questions.",
      "Reported abuses against civilians intensified when Wagner teamed up with the underfunded Malian army in 2021.

      "Japanese authorities did not find any other drugs in his luggage and believe the MDMA was for his personal use. They are still investigating, Fukuda said, while adding that whether Harris made any comment on the case could not be released.",
      "There was no immediate comment from Harris\u2019 representatives.",
      "Japanese criminal procedures allow investigators to keep a suspect in custody for up to 23 days before indictment, and pretrial detention can be prolonged if the accused exercises their right of silence or denies the charges, a practice widely criticized as \u201chostage justice.\u201d",

      "Manzo, a former congressman for Sheinbaum\u2019s Morena party turned critic, was seen throughout Michoacan as the only politician trying to eradicate the drug cartels.

In October, he appealed to the federal government for help.",

      "ROME -- ROME (AP) \u2014 Pope Leo XIV has taken his biggest step yet to correct one of Pope Francis\u2019 more problematic financial moves, canceling a special Holy See fundraising commission that was announced under questionable circumstances while Francis was hospitalized.",
      "Leo on Thursday formally suppressed the fundraising commission, abrogated its statutes and fired its members. He decreed that its assets would go to the Holy See as a whole, and that the Vatican patrimony office would oversee the commission\u2019s extinction.",
      "A new working group would be formed, with papally approved members, to come up with fundraising proposals and an appropriate structure going forward, the decree said.",
      "The decree was the latest sign that as 2025 comes to an end, history's first American pope is wrapping up the loose ends of Francis' pontificate. Leo is correcting problems as needed and fulfilling Francis' Holy Year obligations, as he looks ahead to the new year when he can focus more on his own agenda.",
      "The Vatican had announced the creation of the commission, its statutes and members on Feb. 26, while Francis was in the hospital battling double pneumonia. At the time, he was being visited by the top officials of the Secretariat of State.",
      "The commission included only Italians with no professional fundraising experience.

To some, it smacked of the Italian-led Secretariat of State taking advantage of a sick pope to announce a new flow of unchecked donations into its coffers after Francis took its 600 million-euro ($684 million) sovereign wealth fund away and gave it to another office to manage as punishment for the London fiasco.",
      "The decree by the American pope thus appears to be an effort to wipe the slate clean and start from scratch.

      "MEXICO CITY -- Dozens of farmers drove their tractors in a caravan to Mexico City and blocked an entrance to Mexico\u2019s Congress on Wednesday to protest a new national water law that imposes stricter controls on water use.",
      "The farmers amassed outside the congressional chamber to protest the General Water Law proposal, which they say will take water away from the countryside and re-allocate it for discretionary use. They say the proposal threatens their livelihoods and chips away at their fundamental right to water.",
      "\u201cIf it affects the countryside, it affects the city!\u201d read a banner hanging from two tractors.",
      "\u201cWe are protesting against the imposition by the federal government of a new water law, a reform that puts at risk the ownership of our lands,\u201d said Jorge Robles, a farmer from the northern state of Chihuahua.",

      "The farmers brought their demonstrations to the country\u2019s capital less than a week after they and groups of truck drivers lifted road and highway blockades in at least seven of the country\u2019s 32 states. They were protesting the new water law and insecurity on the country's highways, and demanding increases in corn and wheat prices.",
      "They lifted the blockades after reaching an agreement with the federal government to address their demands but agricultural leaders warned that they were prepared to escalate their protests if the proposal advances in Congress.",

      "The Trump administration will start sending more water to California farmers in the state's crop-rich Central Valley",
      "SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- The Trump administration is making good on a promise to send more water to California farmers in the state\u2019s crop-rich Central Valley.",
      "The U.S. Bureau of Reclamation on Thursday announced a new plan for operating the Central Valley Project, a vast system of pumps, dams and canals that direct water southward from the state\u2019s wetter north. It follows an executive order President Donald Trump signed in January calling for more water to flow to farmers, arguing the state was wasting the precious resource in the name of protecting endangered fish species.",
      "Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum said the plan will help the federal government \u201cstrengthen California\u2019s water resilience.\" It takes effect Friday.",
      "But California officials and environmental groups blasted the move, saying sending significantly more water to farmlands could threaten water delivery to the rest of the state and would harm salmon and other fish.",
      "Most of the state\u2019s water is in the north, but most of its people are in the south. The federally-managed Central Valley Project works in tandem with the state-managed State Water Project, which sends water to cities that supply 27 million Californians. The systems transport water through the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta, an estuary that provides critical habitat to fish and wildlife including salmon and the delta smelt.",
      "It is important for the two systems to work together, Karla Nemeth, director of the California Department of Water Resources, said in a statement. She warned the Trump administration\u2019s plan could limit the state's ability to send water to cities and farmers. That is because the state could be required to devote more water to species protection if the federal project sends more to farms.",
      "Barbara Barrigan-Parrilla, executive director at Restore the Delta, said pumping more water out would result in more Delta smelt and juvenile salmon dying from getting stuck in the pumping system, and once the temperature warms, harmful algae blooms will develop that are dangerous to fish, wildlife, pets and people. That could have economic impacts, she said.",
      "\u201cWhen you destroy water quality and divorce it from land, you are also destroying property values,\u201d she said. \u201cNobody wants to live near a fetid, polluted backwater swamp.\u201d",
      "The Bureau of Reclamation denied the changes would harm the environment or endangered species.",
      "The Central Valley Project primarily sends water to farms, with a much smaller amount going to cities and industrial use. Water from the Central Valley Project irrigates roughly one-third of California agriculture, according to the Bureau of Reclamation.",
      "The Westlands Water District, one of the largest uses of Central Valley Project water, cheered the decision. It \u201cwill help ensure that our growers have the water they need to support local communities and the nation\u2019s food supply, while also protecting California\u2019s wildlife,\u201d general manager Allison Febbo said in a statement.",

      "Front Row Motorsports owner Bob Jenkins has testified in an antitrust case against NASCAR, accusing it of monopolistic practices",
      "CHARLOTTE, N.C. -- Front Row Motorsports owner Bob Jenkins was back on the stand Thursday to testify on the fourth day of the explosive antitrust case that accuses NASCAR of being a monopolistic bully in violation of federal antitrust laws.",
      "Jenkins began his testimony Wednesday and the fast-food franchiser said he was a passionate NASCAR fan who fulfilled a longtime dream when he was finally able to own a car in the top motorsports series in the United States.",
      "But he said he has lost $100 million since becoming a team owner in the early 2000s and that's even with a 2001 victory in the Daytona 500. His love of the sport and belief that it can be profitable have kept him going, but what he believes is a no-win revenue model led Front Row to join 23XI Racing in a federal lawsuit against NASCAR.",
      "23XI is owned by Basketball Hall of Famer Michael Jordan and three-time Daytona 500 winner Denny Hamlin. Jordan has the funding to fight NASCAR and Jenkins joined the battle when he became offended by NASCAR's \u201ctake-it-or-leave-it\u201d offer on charter agreements.",
      "A charter is the equivalent of the franchise model used by other sports leagues, but in NASCAR it guarantees a team a spot in the field for all 38 races plus a designated percentage of revenue. Front Row was one of the teams that received two charters for free when NASCAR created the system in 2016 and Jenkins thought the agreements were lousy then \u2014 but a step in the right direction.",
      "All 15 Sprint Cup organizations fought for more than two years for better terms on the charter extensions that began this year. But when NASCAR's final offer was presented at 6 p.m. on a Friday last year with six hours to sign the 112-page document, Jenkins balked because it went \u201cvirtually backward in so many ways.",
      "\u201cIt was insulting, it went so far backward,\" he testified Wednesday. \"NASCAR wanted to run the governance with an iron fist, it was like taxation without representation. NASCAR has the right to do whatever it wants.\u201d",
      "He said he was \"honestly very hurt\u201d by the sequence of events and believed NASCAR \u201cknew we had to blindly sign it. Some of these owners have $500-$600 million facilities, long-term sponsors. They couldn\u2019t walk away from that.\u201d",
      "Jenkins testified that Joe Gibbs personally apologized to Jenkins for signing the deal, and most owners reluctantly signed the agreement.",
      "\u201cNot a single owner said, \u2018I was happy to sign it.\u2019 Not a single one,\u201d he testified. \u201c100% of the owners think the charter system is good,\u201d Jenkins said. \u201cThe charter agreement is not.\u201d",
      "Front Row and 23XI were the only two organizations out of 15 that refused to sign and instead went to court in a trial that could completely rework NASCAR's framework.",
      "The extensions ended more than two years of bitter negotiations in which neither NASCAR or the teams budged.",
      "NASCAR executive vice president in charge of strategy Scott Prime testified Wednesday that a study he worked on as a consultant found the longevity of the sport was in danger if NASCAR didn\u2019t act to improve the health of their race teams.",

      "NASCAR contends it is doing nothing wrong and has not restrained trade or commerce by its teams. The series says the original charters were given for free to teams when the system was created in 2016 and the demand for them created a market of $1.5 billion in equity for chartered organizations.",
      "The new charter agreement upped the guaranteed money for every chartered car to $12.5 million in annual revenue, from $9 million. But Hamlin and Jenkins have both testified it costs $20 million to bring a single car to the track for all 38 races and that figure does not include any overhead, operating costs or a driver\u2019s salary.",

      "\u201cIt\u2019s offensive to say I\u2019ve overspent. We have a model that works for us,\u201d Jenkins testified. \u201cI have never turned a profit. And it\u2019s not from malpractice. The level we compete at is just so expensive.\u201d",
      "Prime testified as much and noted in his consulting role he discovered in 2014 that teams lost a combined $85 million, or an average of $1.3 million a car. He also learned that under the system before charters, when cars had to qualify for a race based on speed, a team would lose $700,000 if it failed to make the field.",

      "BERLIN -- Germany's parliament on Friday approved a pension reform package that had prompted a rebellion in the ranks of Chancellor Friedrich Merz's party, the latest instalment of a bumpy first seven months in office.",
      "Lawmakers in the lower house voted 319-225 in favor of the package, including a measure that would hold the level of state pensions at 48% of average wages until 2031. There were 53 abstentions.",

      "The government picked a company with little experience working with the Federal Aviation Administration called Peraton to oversee the roughly $31.5 billion overhaul of the outdated air traffic control system.",
      "Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said Thursday evening that Peraton was chosen in the hope that its innovative approach will make it possible to complete the upgrades within the next three years before the end of President Donald Trump's term in office ends. Peraton was chosen over Parsons Corp., which does have extensive experience with FAA contracts.",
      "\u201cWorking together, we are going to build on the incredible progress we\u2019ve already made and deliver a state-of-the-art air traffic control system that the American traveling public \u2014 and our hard-working air traffic controllers \u2014 deserve,\u201d Duffy said in the announcement.",
      "Here\u2019s what to know about the modernization project and the company hired to oversee it:",
      "Earlier this year, Congress approved $12.5 billion as a down payment on the project after technical problems twice knocked out the radar for air traffic controllers managing planes around Newark Liberty International Airport. This year began with the worst American aviation disaster in years when an airliner collided with an Army helicopter over Washington D.C., killing 67 people.",
      "Duffy has said he'll need roughly $20 billion more to complete the upgrade.",
      "This effort to upgrade the technology controllers use is on a much more aggressive timeline than the previous NextGen effort that began shortly after the turn of the century and failed to deliver all the benefits it promised even after an investment of $36 billion. The Biden administration had estimated that upgrading the system might take more than a decade.",
      "The FAA hasn't yet released the details of how much Peraton will be paid for this contract, but the agency said it includes incentives to reward good performance and penalties for shortcomings.",
      "The technical problems that disrupted flights at the Newark airport in the spring demonstrated just how fragile the nation's aging air traffic control system is. And Duffy has said those kind of technical failures in a system that too often still relies on copper wires and floppy discs could happen anywhere unless the system is upgraded.",
      "Hundreds of flights were canceled or delayed in Newark. After the radar outages, the facility in Philadelphia that controls the flights in and out of Newark had a half dozen controllers go on leave, which forced the reductions in flights.",
      "The number of flights across the country each day that the FAA has to safely manage is expected to continue growing in the years ahead. And drones will continue to proliferate across the country as flying taxis start to take to the air.",
      "Everyone agrees that the air traffic control system must be modernized to be able to handle those future demands.",
      "John Rose, chief risk adviser for global travel management company ALTOUR, said the three-year timeline is \u201cextremely aggressive\u201d but partially realistic. He said it\u2019s plausible for the FAA to build the foundation for a modern air traffic control network in its tight timeline, with more advanced capabilities layered on later.",
      "\u201cYou need to build the base before you can have all the bells and whistles,\u201d he said. \u201cIf the project gets to the core structure in three years, I think we\u2019ve accomplished the mission.\u201d",
      "He likened it to an iPhone where once you have a robust base system you can upgrade the software like when the phone gets an iOS update. \u201cIf they build the infrastructure, then as things change from a technology capability, it\u2019s almost like a plug and play,\u201d he said.",
      "Air Traffic Control Association President and CEO Stephen Creamer represents the companies that make the gear that Peraton and the FAA will use to complete the upgrades. He said it helps that the new system won't have to be built from scratch.",

      "\u201cWhenever I have enough money to save, I immediately convert it into gold,\u201d said Hamid Safari, who sells audio equipment. \"Throughout history, gold has not only held its value but also increased in worth. We should learn from history if we want to build a better life.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, wealthier investors are turning to diamonds and other gemstones as discreet, portable stores of value. Jewelers in Tehran and Mashhad report rising demand for small-carat investment-grade stones \u2014 a niche traditionally favored by traders but now expanding to upper-middle-class buyers.",
      "Iran\u2019s broader economy remains under severe pressure from international sanctions that have cut off investment and limited access to global finance. Years of restrictions have weakened domestic industries and left key sectors struggling to modernize. And for those wanting to get money out abroad, hard currency and jewelry remains some of the only ways to do so.",
      "There's also another reason that Iranians remain reluctant to discuss \u2014 being able to have the money portable in case of another war. Tens of thousands of Iranians living in Tehran are believed to have fled the capital during the 12-day war, heading out into the countryside of Iran or north to the coast of the Caspian Sea.",
      "When they did, they found some areas overwhelmed by newcomers and ATMs either out of cash or nonfunctional. Many brought whatever savings they could immediately put their hands on with them.",
      "There's precedent for this in Iranian history as well. Many who fled the cities during the 1980s Iran-Iraq war took whatever they could with them. And in the 1979 Islamic Revolution, those allied with the shah and his government fled Iran with whatever they could carry. Back then, the rial hit an all-time high of 120 to $1, which saw money-changing shops inundated and people buying gold, jewelry, rugs and other assets to spirit abroad.",

      "Somalia's international airport was filled with anticipation on a recent morning as 165 migrants were repatriated from Libya",
      "MOGADISHU, Somalia -- Somali migrant Mohamed Abdi Awale endured horrors on an ill-fated journey across Africa to seek a better life in the West \u2014 but he's determined to try again one day, even aiming for the U.S. despite increasing restrictions.",
      "Awale is one of 165 Somali migrants recently repatriated after being detained in Libya, where the International Organization for Migration says those caught on journeys to Europe face \u201cunacceptable and inhumane conditions.\u201d",
      "Awale undertook a more than 5,000-kilometer (3,100-mile) journey, leaving Somalia's capital, Mogadishu, to cross Kenya, Uganda, South Sudan and Sudan.",
      "He was captured by smugglers near the Sudan-Libyan border and taken to the Sahara oasis town of Kufra, where captors filmed him being tortured in a bid to extract a ransom from his family.",
      "\u201cTorture became normal,\u201d Awale said. \u201cIf you failed to pay, they beat you until you fainted. Some people lost their minds. Others didn\u2019t survive.\u201d",
      "Unable to afford the ransom, his mother, Hawo Elmo Rage, turned to social media, pleading with Somalis at home and abroad to help her save her son.",
      "\u201cThey told me to send the money or they would take his life,\u201d Rage said. She ultimately raised $17,000, enough to free him.",
      "Awale was released from Kufra and put in a car bound for the Mediterranean coast with other migrants. After their vehicle broke down, the group trekked for more than two weeks, facing starvation and dehydration.",
      "\u201cI thought we would die there,\u201d Awale said.",
      "The group was then detained outside of Tripoli, and Awale spent a month in prison in the coastal town of Sirte and another two months in detention in Tripoli before his repatriation to Somalia in November.",
      "Awale became one of hundreds of thousands of Somalis that have fled the country in more than three decades of civil war, according to UNHCR, the U.N. refugee agency, which estimates that another 3.5 million people are displaced within Somalia itself.",

      "Changes to immigration policy this year under Trump administration changed the calculus of migrants like Awale. U.S. President Donald Trump banned travel to the U.S. by citizens of Somalia and 11 other countries in June \u2014 so Awale set his sights on Europe.",
      "Awale remains hopeful that he will reach the U.S. one day, despite anti-Somali sentiment from the White House and a further tightening of immigration restrictions for Somalis.",
      "The White House also announced this week that it was pausing all immigration applications for people from 19 countries, including Somalia.",

      "In the city of Kenner, which has the highest concentration of Hispanic residents in Louisiana, a federal immigration crackdown aiming for 5,000 arrests has devastated an economy already struggling from ramped-up enforcement efforts this year, some business owners say, and had far-reaching impacts on both immigrants and U.S. citizens alike.",

      "Hong Kong residents and experts are pushing back against claims that bamboo scaffolding was a key reason for the city's deadliest fire in decades",
      "HONG KONG -- Hong Kong residents, construction professionals and former senior officials are pushing back against the idea that bamboo scaffolding was a main reason flames spread so quickly in the city\u2019s deadliest blaze in decades, as a debate flares over whether it should be replaced.",
      "Authorities were quick to focus on the traditional scaffolding enveloping the apartment buildings at the Wang Fuk Court complex -- where the fatal Nov. 26 blaze spread from one tower to seven, killing at least 159 people. While much of the green netting covering the scaffolding incinerated, some of the bamboo scaffolding also burned and fell, and officials have stepped up plans to replace it.",
      "Bamboo scaffolding is a common sight on Hong Kong high rises, though mainland China and places elsewhere in Asia have mostly begun using metal alternatives.",
      "An industry union says Hong Kong has an estimated 3,000 workers registered to erect bamboo scaffolding, a construction technique dating back hundreds of years.",
      "\u201cI would be very cautious about blaming bamboo itself before the full investigation reports are published,\u201d said Kristof Crolla, an associate professor of architecture at the University of Hong Kong whose focus includes bamboo architecture.",
      "As a natural material, bamboo can be combustible, Crolla said. But \u201cwhen it is properly used and combined with certified fire-retardant netting it is comparatively hard to ignite.\u201d",
      "During the fire, flames shot up the bamboo scaffolding erected for external maintenance work,-as well as the green netting draping it. But bamboo is usually not \u201ceasily ignited,\" said Raffaella Endrizzi, an architect who researches bamboo scaffolding who teaches at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. \u201cFocusing on bamboo alone risks obscuring more systemic safety issues,\u201d she said.",
      "Last week, as firefighters battled the deadly inferno for a second day, the city\u2019s chief secretary for administration, Eric Chan, told reporters that bamboo scaffolding's fire resistance was \u201cinferior\u201d to that of metal scaffolding.",
      "The city's top leader, John Lee, said officials had met with construction industry representatives to discuss timelines for switching to metal scaffolding. Metal should be used for safety reasons when possible, Chan said.",
      "The initial cause of the fire is under investigation. So far, experts have found that some of the green netting wrapped around the bamboo scaffolding was substandard and that flammable foam boards were used to seal windows during the months' long renovations. Those were the main factors causing the fire to spread to seven of the eight buildings in the Wang Fuk Court complex, said Secretary for Security Chris Tang.",
      "One note in Chinese left among a mountain of bouquets placed near the disaster site stood out: \u201cit\u2019s not the bamboo scaffolding that should be reviewed, but the whole system.\" Many others have posted similar comments on social media.",
      "Putting the blame on bamboo scaffolding is a \u201clazy, scapegoating\u201d move that distracts from deeper issues, Regina Ip, a former Hong Kong secretary for security who is an adviser to the chief executive, Lee, wrote Tuesday in the local newspaper Ming Pao.",
      "\u201cIt would be a great pity to hastily decide on banning bamboo scaffolding -- which is flexible to use -- because of this incident,\u201d John Tsang, a former Hong Kong financial secretary, wrote on his Facebook page.",
      "\u201cAnyone with common sense knows that bamboo isn\u2019t so easy to burn,\u201d he said.",
      "Those defending bamboo scaffolding say it's uniquely suited to Hong Kong\u2019s dense, irregular urban landscape.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s light, fast, adaptable, and supported by generations of skilled scaffolders -- qualities that have shaped the city\u2019s skyline and construction pace,\u201d said Endrizzi, of the Chinese University of Hong Kong.",

      "\u201cSwitching materials alone (from bamboo to metal scaffolding) won\u2019t address underlying problems around specification, enforcement, and site supervision,\u201d said Endrizzi. Policy changes should be based on evidence because otherwise Hong Kong risks disrupting a system that has worked for decades, while failing to crack down on regulatory problems and the use of unauthorized construction materials, she said.",

      "Former South African President Jacob Zuma and French arms manufacturer Thales have returned to court to appeal for the dismissal of the long-running corruption case against them",
      "JOHANNESBURG -- Former South African President Jacob Zuma and his co-accused, the French arms manufacturer Thales, returned to court on Thursday to appeal for the dismissal of the long-running corruption case against them.",
      "Zuma, one of the key figures of the South African liberation struggle who served as president from 2009 to 2018, is accused of corruption in connection with an arms transaction in 1999.",
      "Here's what to know about the case:",
      "Zuma faces 18 charges, including corruption, fraud, and money laundering, linked to 783 alleged illegal payments he received from Thales (formerly Thomson-CSF) and business owner Schabir Shaik.",
      "Zuma has denied every indictment, saying the accusations are part of a \u201cwitch hunt\u201d with political motivations. He is currently fighting to have the charges dropped after pleading not guilty.",
      "The case has been ongoing for nearly two decades, facing multiple delays including legal challenges by Zuma\u2019s team, which has repeatedly appealed and challenged the charges.",
      "In a potentially groundbreaking development, the National Prosecuting Authority is arguing before Judge Nkosinathi Emmanuel Chili this week that Zuma and Thales should be blocked from using appeals to further delay the trial.",
      "\u201cOur problem is that this strategy has delayed the case for 18 years,\u201d prosecutor Wim Trengove told the court on Thursday. \u201cMr. Zuma has over the years run eight different interlocutory applications and Thales has been part of four. They have between them delayed the hearing for more than 18 years. All those applications have been dismissed.\u201d",
      "The ex-president's lawyers have questioned lead prosecutor Billy Downer\u2019s impartiality, leading to additional delays. The former president\u2019s ill health has further stalled the case.",
      "Zuma\u2019s defense attorneys have also contended that without the testimony of two crucial Thales executives in the case \u2014 former directors Pierre Moynot and Alain Thetard, who died in 2020 and 2022 \u2014 they won\u2019t be able to mount a meaningful defense.",
      "Zuma was found in contempt of court by the South African Constitutional Court in 2021 in a separate case. He received a 15-month prison sentence for refusing to testify before the Zondo committee, a judicial commission investigating allegations of corruption during the time Zuma was president.",

He was then released on medical parole, but the parole was ruled to be unlawful, and he was ordered back to prison. He was later released from prison after his sentence was commuted.",
      "In October this year, the former president was ordered to pay back $1.6 million (R28.9 million) in legal fees that were unlawfully funded by the state for his personal corruption case defense. The Gauteng High Court in Pretoria ruled that Zuma must also pay interest on the amount.",

    "summary": "Police in Edmonton, Canada, have started a pilot project using AI-equipped body cameras to detect faces on a &quot;high risk&quot; watch list",
    "story": [
      "Police in Edmonton, Canada, have started a pilot project using AI-equipped body cameras to detect faces on a \"high risk\" watch list",
      "Police body cameras equipped with artificial intelligence have been trained to detect the faces of about 7,000 people on a \u201chigh risk\u201d watch list in the Canadian city of Edmonton, a live test of whether facial recognition technology shunned as too intrusive could have a place in policing throughout North America.",
      "But six years after leading body camera maker Axon Enterprise, Inc. said police use of facial recognition technology posed serious ethical concerns, the pilot project \u2014 switched on last week\u2014 is raising alarms far beyond Edmonton, the continent\u2019s northernmost city of more than 1 million people.",
      "A former chair of Axon\u2019s AI ethics board, which led the company to temporarily abandon facial recognition in 2019, told The Associated Press he\u2019s concerned that the Arizona-based company is moving forward without enough public debate, testing and expert vetting about the societal risks and privacy implications.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s essential not to use these technologies, which have very real costs and risks, unless there\u2019s some clear indication of the benefits,\u201d said the former board chair, Barry Friedman, now a law professor at New York University.",
      "Axon founder and CEO Rick Smith contends that the Edmonton pilot is not a product launch but \u201cearly-stage field research\u201d that will assess how the technology performs and reveal the safeguards needed to use it responsibly.",
      "\u201cBy testing in real-world conditions outside the U.S., we can gather independent insights, strengthen oversight frameworks, and apply those learnings to future evaluations, including within the United States,\u201d Smith wrote in a blog post.",
      "The pilot is meant to help make Edmonton patrol officers safer by enabling their body-worn cameras to detect anyone who authorities classified as having a \u201cflag or caution\u201d for categories such as \u201cviolent or assaultive; armed and dangerous; weapons; escape risk; and high-risk offender,\u201d said Kurt Martin, acting superintendent of the Edmonton Police Service. So far, that watch list has 6,341 people on it, Martin said at a Dec. 2 press conference. A separate watch list adds 724 people who have at least one serious criminal warrant, he said.",
      "\u201cWe really want to make sure that it\u2019s targeted so that these are folks with serious offenses,\" said Ann-Li Cooke, Axon\u2019s director of responsible AI.",
      "If the pilot expands, it could have a major effect on policing around the world. Axon, a publicly traded firm best known for developing the Taser, is the dominant U.S. supplier of body cameras and has increasingly pitched them to police agencies in Canada and elsewhere. Axon last year beat its closest competitor, Chicago-based Motorola Solutions, in a bid to sell body cameras to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.",
      "Motorola said in a statement that it also has the ability to integrate facial recognition technology into police body cameras but, based on its ethical principles, has \u201cintentionally abstained from deploying this feature for proactive identification.\" It didn't rule out using it in the future.",
      "The government of Alberta in 2023 mandated body cameras for all police agencies in the province, including its capital city Edmonton, describing it as a transparency measure to document police interactions, collect better evidence and reduce timelines for resolving investigations and complaints.",
      "While many communities in the U.S. have also welcomed body cameras as an accountability tool, the prospect of real-time facial recognition identifying people in public places has been unpopular across the political spectrum. Backlash from civil liberties advocates and a broader conversation about racial injustice helped push Axon and Big Tech companies to pause facial recognition software sales to police.",
      "Among the biggest concerns were studies showing that the technology was flawed, demonstrating biased results by race, gender and age. It also didn't match faces as accurately on real-time video feeds as it did on faces posing for identification cards or police mug shots.",
      "Several U.S. states and dozens of cities have sought to curtail police use of facial recognition, though President Donald Trump's administration is now trying to block or discourage states from regulating AI.",
      "The European Union banned real-time public face-scanning police technology across the 27-nation bloc, except when used for serious crimes like kidnapping or terrorism.",
      "But in the United Kingdom, no longer part of the EU, authorities started testing the technology on London streets a decade ago and have used it to make 1,300 arrests in the past two years. The government is considering expanding its use across the country.",
      "Many details about Edmonton's pilot haven't been publicly disclosed. Axon doesn't make its own AI model for recognizing faces but declined to say which third-party vendor it uses.",

      "Martin said about 50 officers piloting the technology won't know if the facial recognition software made a match. The outputs will be analyzed later at the station. In the future, however, it could help police detect if there's a potentially dangerous person nearby so they can call in for assistance, Martin said.",
      "That's only supposed to happen if officers have started an investigation or are responding to a call, not simply while strolling through a crowd. Martin said officers responding to a call can switch their cameras from a passive to an active recording mode with higher-resolution imaging.",
      "\u201cWe really want to respect individuals\u2019 rights and their privacy interests,\u201d Martin said.",
      "The office of Alberta\u2019s information and privacy commissioner Diane McLeod said she received a privacy impact assessment from Edmonton police on Dec. 2, the same day Axon and police officials announced the program. The office said Friday it\u2019s now working to review the assessment, a requirement for projects that collect \u201chigh sensitivity\u201d personal data.",
      "University of Alberta criminology professor Temitope Oriola said he's not surprised that the city is experimenting with live facial recognition, given that the technology is already ubiquitous in airport security and other environments.",
      "\u201cEdmonton is a laboratory for this tool,\u201d Oriola said. \u201cIt may well turn out to be an improvement, but we do not know that for sure.\u201d",
      "Oriola said the police service has had a sometimes \u201cfrosty\u201d relationship with its Indigenous and Black residents, particularly after the fatal police shooting of a member of the South Sudanese community last year, and it remains to be seen whether facial recognition technology makes policing safer or improves interactions with the public.",
      "Axon has faced blowback for its technology deployments in the past, as in 2022, when Friedman and seven other members of Axon's AI ethics board resigned in protest over concerns about a Taser-equipped drone.",
      "In the years since Axon opted against facial recognition, Smith, the CEO, says the company has \u201ccontinued controlled, lab-based research\u201d of a technology that has \u201cbecome significantly more accurate\u201d and is now ready for trial in the real world.",
      "But Axon acknowledged in a statement to the AP that all facial recognition systems are affected by \"factors like distance, lighting and angle, which can disproportionately impact accuracy for darker-skinned individuals.\u201d",
      "Every match requires human review, Axon said, and part of its testing is also \u201clearning what training and oversight human reviewers must have to mitigate known risks.\u201d",
      "Friedman said Axon should disclose those evaluations. He'd want to see more evidence that facial recognition has improved since his board concluded that it wasn't reliable enough to ethically justify its use in police cameras.",
      "Friedman said he's also concerned about police agencies greenlighting the technology's use without deliberation by local legislators and rigorous scientific testing.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not a decision to be made simply by police agencies and certainly not by vendors,\" he said. \u201cA pilot is a great idea. But there\u2019s supposed to be transparency, accountability. ... None of that\u2019s here. They\u2019re just going ahead. They found an agency willing to go ahead and they\u2019re just going ahead.\u201d",

      "But based on Cloudflare's initial statements, Friday's incident came \"down to a database change they had made as part of planned maintenance that just went slightly awry,\" according to Richard Ford, chief technology officer at Integrity360, a Europe and Africa-based cybersecurity firm.",

      "Huang's closed-door meeting with Republicans on the Senate Banking Committee came at a moment of intensifying lobbying, soaring investments and audacious forecasts by major tech companies about AI\u2019s potential transformative effects.",
      "Huang is among the Silicon Valley executives who warn that any restrictions on the technology will halt its advancement despite mounting concerns among policymakers and the public about AI's potential pitfalls or the ways foreign rivals like China may use American hardware.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve said repeatedly that we support export control, that we should ensure that American companies have the best and the most and first,\u201d Huang told reporters before his meeting on Capitol Hill.",
      "He added that he shared concerns about selling AI chips to China but believed that restrictions haven't slowed Chinese advancement in the AI race.",
      "\u201cWe need to be able to compete around the world. The one thing we can\u2019t do is we can\u2019t degrade the chips that we sell to China. They won\u2019t accept that. There\u2019s a reason why they wouldn\u2019t accept that, and so we should offer the most competitive chips we can to the Chinese market,\u201d Huang said.",
      "Huang also said he\u2019d met with Trump earlier Wednesday and discussed export controls for Nvidia\u2019s chips. Huang added that he wished the president \u201ca happy holidays.\u201d",
      "The Trump administration in May reversed Biden-era restrictions that had prevented Nvidia and other chipmakers from exporting their chips to a wide range of countries. The White House in August also announced an unusual deal that would allow Nvidia and another U.S. chipmaker, Advanced Micro Devices, to sell their chips in the Chinese market but would require the U.S. government to take a 15% cut of the sales.",

      "Members of Congress have generally considered the sale of high-end AI chips to China to be a national security risk. China is the main competitor to the U.S. in the race to develop artificial superintelligence.

      "Asked whether he believed Nvidia's interests and goals were fully aligned with U.S. national security, Rounds replied: \u201cThey currently do not sell chips in China. And they understand that they\u2019re an American company. They want to be able to compete around the rest of the world.

I don\u2019t blame you for that, but if I\u2019m looking for someone to give me objective advice about whether we should make our technology available to China, he's not it.\"",

      "But he wouldn't just ask it for a joke \u2014 Willonius says most chatbot-generated comedy lacks the \u201cnuances or complexities that it takes for jokes to really land.\u201d",
      "A scholar of comedy, Michelle Robinson, said \u201ca lot of the stuff that I\u2019ve seen AI produce is corny as hell.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt does seem fluent in the basic grammar of jokes, but sometimes they\u2019re slightly off,\u201d said Robinson, a professor of American studies at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. \u201cThey may be moderately funny, but I think they\u2019re really missing an important element of what makes us laugh.\u201d",
      "What are they missing? She's not totally sure, except that most good jokes are a little edgy or dangerous and chatbots can't seem to calibrate \u201cwhatever provocation is in the joke to the moment that we\u2019re living in.\u201d",
      "Caleb Warren, a professor who studies marketing and consumer psychology at the University of Arizona, said that leaves comedy writers with an opportunity to make use of tools that can't completely outsource their skills.",
      "\u201cThe ideas that are driving the humor are coming from the human comedian,\u201d but the AI tools can help them execute and illustrate them, Warren said.",

      "The latest crop of AI-powered shopping services and tools made their debut in recent weeks, just in time to kick off the holiday shopping season that begins with Black Friday.",
      "Here\u2019s a rundown of existing and newly released AI services that can help with your search for the perfect gift in the run-up to Christmas:",
      "Amazon led the way by rolling out its Rufus chatbot in 2024. Other ecommerce websites followed with their own AI assistants to enhance the online shopping experience.",
      "Walmart's Sparky chatbot is available on the retail giant\u2019s app and can synthesize reviews or offer product recommendations based on occasions, such as Christmas. Target recently unveiled a gift finder chatbot on its app, but it's only available for the holiday season. Ralph Lauren partnered with Microsoft on the \u201cAsk Ralph\u201d chatbot to provide style recommendations.",
      "The aim of deploying chatbots is to make it easier for people to find what they\u2019re looking for. Instead of entering search terms and keywords, you can type or use voice dictation for a conversational back-and-forth.",
      "The results, in my experience, can be mixed.",
      "I tried Rufus recently to find a replacement aftermarket stainless steel pot for my rice cooker, as well as a protective trivet for my kitchen sink faucet. In both cases, the results weren\u2019t quite right and didn\u2019t seem to capture the wide range of products available. Sometimes the results were completely unsuitable.",
      "I ended up doing a more painstaking search of product listings\u2019 pictures and specifications to find the right items. The problem, I suspect, is partly because I was looking for generic products. Searches for name-brand products may produce better results.",
      "Perhaps you don\u2019t want to limit yourself to a single retailer\u2019s website in your Christmas shopping search. Or you\u2019re not sure where exactly to find that perfect gift.",

The feature will activate if you ask ChatGPT a shopping-related question or manually turn it on in the chat window. OpenAI says it can go beyond simple questions, such as checking a price or feature that regular ChatGPT can easily answer.",
      "Google users can get a similar experience when they use its search engine in AI Mode, which recently got a big update for shopping searches. The company says users can describe what they\u2019re looking for as if talking to a friend and get an \u201cintelligently organized response\u201d based on 50 billion product listings, with pictures alongside prices, reviews and inventory info.",

      "Conservationists are hoping to strengthen regulations at a wildlife trade conference on birds, reptiles and other animals that are seeing their numbers decline due to the exotic pet trade",
      "A growing exotic pet trade has conservationists calling for stronger regulations to protect the reptiles, birds and other animals in the wild that are increasingly showing up for sale on internet marketplaces and becoming popular on social media.",
      "The two-week Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora is scheduled to run through Friday in Samarkand, Uzbekistan. Several proposals related to the pet trade will be considered Tuesday.",
      "Participants have proposed tighter regulations or complete bans on the trade of several species including iguanas from the Galapagos Islands, more than a dozen species of Latin America tarantulas and an odd-looking turtle from Africa.",
      "\u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing is the pet trade much more looking at reptiles, amphibians. People want rare species and they don\u2019t have to go into a pet shop,\u201d said Susan Lieberman, vice president for international policy at the nonprofit Wildlife Conservation Society. \u201cThey go online and there are thousands of animals, including endangered species, illegally obtained species, all available on the internet.\u201d",
      "In the past, the trade was dominated by sales in animal parts like elephant ivory and tiger bones. But Matt Collis, the senior director of international policy at the International Fund for Animal Welfare, said live animals for the pet trade are increasingly turning up on the internet.",
      "\u201cThe dramatic growth in online marketplaces has put consumers directly in touch with wildlife traders and criminals around the world,\u201d Collis said. \u201cIn today\u2019s society where pretty much anything can be bought with a click of a button and shipped anywhere in the world in a matter of days, no wildlife is safe.\u201d",
      "Social media influencers, who have made owned exotic pets cool, are also contributing to the problem, Collis said.",
      "Several of the species proposed for greater protection at the CITES conference are in Latin America, where an IFAW report last year found illegal trade is on the rise. The report, covering 18 Spanish speaking Latin American countries, says there were more than 100,000 animals seized or poached from 2017 to 2022, with seizures increasing every year.",
      "The report found the live pet trade accounted for a growing piece of the trade, with reptiles representing about 60% of the animals, while nearly 30% were birds and more than 10% were amphibians. Many animals were traded locally or regionally but there also was evidence of animals shipped to collectors in Europe, Asia and the United States.",
      "More than 90% of the seized wildlife destined for Europe were live animals, confirming the demand for pets was a key driver of the illegal trade, the report said.",
      "Among the reptile species up for tighter trade controls is Home\u2019s Hinged-back Tortoise, a critically endangered turtle found in West Africa that has a unique hinge on its back allowing it to close off its back legs and tail.",
      "There are proposals to regulate the trade in two vipers species endemic to Ethiopia, two species of rattlesnake found mostly in Mexico, the leaf-tailed gecko from Australia and two species of sloths from South America, which are increasingly turning up in sloth-themed cafes in Asia.",
      "A proposal from Ecuador would ban the trade in marine and land iguanas from the Galapagos, which are listed by the International Union for Conservation of Nature as critically endangered or vulnerable. There are concerns that the illegal trade could further destabilize the population, which already faces threats from invasive species, rising tourism and fluctuations in weather associated with the El Nino.",
      "In its CITES proposal, Ecuador said it doesn't permit commercial export of iguanas and collecting them from the Galapagos has been prohibited for decades. But Ecuador raised concerns that traders are capturing and transporting young iguanas by boat or overland to ports and evading authorities by mislabeling them as captive bred. Most of the iguanas are destined for Japan and other Asia countries and can sell for as much $25,000 on the black market.",

      "\u201cIn theory, under CITES rules, the countries issuing those export permits should be checking that these animals, and crucially their parentage all the way back to the founder stock, were legally acquired in order for an export permit to be granted,\u201d Collis said. \u201cBut that is not happening.\"",
      "Countries issue permits without verifying animal origins, which helps traffickers launder animals from illegal sources, \u201cundermining the very framework meant to protect these species,\u201d he said.",
      "The CITES proposals draw attention to a long-running problem with captive breeding of exotic species, according to Lieberman of the Wildlife Conservation Society.",
      "\u201cWhen the treaty was drafted in the early 1970s, there wasn't a lot of captive breeding and people thought, 'Well, if they\u2019re bred in captivity, it\u2019ll take pressure off the wild,\u201d she said. \u201cSounds good, except it doesn\u2019t work that way. Breeding in captivity also creates a market, but they\u2019re cheaper from the wild. And also it\u2019s a great way to launder.\u201d",
      "A proposal has also been submitted at the convention to regulate the trade in more than a dozen species of tarantulas. Bolivia, Argentina and Panama note they are \u201camong the most heavily traded groups of invertebrates\u201d with more than half all species available online. The proposal would permit the trade in the spiders as long as there is proof the sources are legal, sustainable and traceable.",
      "\u201cSome tarantula species are particularly vulnerable to overexploitation due to their long life span, limited geographic range and low reproductive rate,\u201d according to the proposal. \u201cAlarmingly, most of them are not regulated internationally, despite the high availability of hundreds of species in international trade.\u201d",
      "The United States Association of Reptile Keepers opposes the tarantula listing, which it called \u201cincongruous\u201d for rolling many species into a single proposal.",
      "The association, which advocates for responsible private ownership and trade in reptiles and amphibians, suggested other reptile proposals reflect government overreach, noting the proffered changes to iguana sales are unnecessary since current regulations \u201cprovide adequate protection.\u201d",
      "\u201cMost species have limited trade in captive bred specimens which is not a threat to wild populations,\u201d David Garcia, the organization's legal counsel and its delegate at the CITES conference, said in a statement. \u201cUnfortunately, many countries, groups, and individuals take the nonsensical position that the way to limit threats to wild populations is to make the captive reproduction of those species more difficult.",
      "But a report from the nonprofit Center for Biological Diversity, shared with The Associated Press and due to be released Dec. 8, found that the United States was among the biggest markets for the pet trade, importing on average 90 million live amphibians, arachnids, birds, aquarium fish, mammals and reptiles each year.",
      "\u201cWildlife exploitation, including for the pet trade, is a major driver of the global extinction crisis,\u201d the report said. \u201cOne million species are on track to face extinction in coming decades unless action is taken to address species loss. Addressing the United States\u2019 role in the exotic pet trade must be a top priority to stem this crisis and protect biodiversity for future generations.\u201d",

      "India\u2019s telecoms ministry has ordered smartphone manufacturers to install a government-run cybersecurity app on all new devices",
      "NEW DELHI -- India\u2019s telecoms ministry has directed smartphone manufacturers to pre-install a government-run cybersecurity app on all new devices, according to a government order, raising concerns of data privacy and user consent in one of the largest handset markets in the world.",
      "The Ministry of Communications' order issued Monday asked smartphone makers to pre-install the government\u2019s \u201cSanchar Saathi\u201d app on all new devices within 90 days and to prevent users from deleting it. The order also requires manufacturers to push the app onto older models through a software update, extending the mandate beyond phones available in the market.",
      "The ministry said the app, which is available to India\u2019s 1.2 billion smartphone users, was essential in \u201ccurbing misuse of telecom resources for cyber frauds and ensuring telecom cyber security.\u201d But privacy advocates say the order marks an effort to erode user privacy and consent.",
      "\u201cThis is the beginning. It is government testing the waters,\u201d said Nikhil Pahwa, a digital policy expert and founder of the tech site MediaNama. \u201cOnce a government app is forcibly pre-installed on our devices, what\u2019s to stop them from pushing future apps that could be used for surveillance?\u201d",
      "Amid growing criticism, India\u2019s telecom minister, Jyotiraditya M. Scindia, on Tuesday called the app a \u201cvoluntary and democratic system\" and said users can choose to activate it and \u201ceasily delete it from their phone at any time.\u201d",
      "Scindia did not clarify Monday\u2019s directive instructing smartphone manufacturers to ensure the app\u2019s \u201cfunctionalities are not disabled or restricted.\u201d",
      "The \u201cSanchar Saathi\u201d app, which was released in January, was designed to let users block and track lost or stolen phones and to identify and shut down fraudulent mobile connections. Since its launch, it has drawn more than 5 million downloads and helped recover more than 700,000 lost devices, according to government data.",

      "\u201cPhones are our personal spaces. We have a choice to have what we want on them. Here the government is taking away that choice,\u201d he said.",
      "The order is also expected to face resistance from smartphone companies like U.S.-based Apple, whose internal policies prohibit preinstalling third-party apps on its devices, including those developed by governments.",
      "It also comes as several governments take similar steps.",
      "In Russia, authorities have recently promoted the MAX messaging service, which must be pre-installed on all smartphones. Critics say the platform functions as a surveillance tool, noting that MAX openly states it will provide user data to officials upon request.",

Lamar's nod to the console \u2014 which Sony had nothing to do with \u2014 was another sign of how far the brand has penetrated the culture, in ways big and small.",
      "From big-budget Hollywood fare like \u201cLara Croft: Tomb Raider\u201d starring Angelina Jolie, to Juice WRLD's video for \u201cHear Me Calling\u201d to \u201cThe Last of Us\u201d on HBO Max, the PlayStation experience has leapt far past the console. Chandler Bing on \u201cFriends\u201d played a PlayStation 1 and the title character fired at PlayStation zombies in the cult movie \u201cShaun of the Dead.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe made gaming cool. When we came out we were a little edgy, we were a different, but it was really about being disruptive,\u201d says Eric Lempel, senior vice president for marketing, sales and business operations at Sony Interactive Entertainment. \u201cWe feel we are a premier entertainment brand, not just a gaming brand.\u201d",
      "Part of the enduring popularity of the PlayStation has been its ability to evolve with the technology, starting in 1995 by picking CD-ROMs that opened the door to 3D gaming. At the time, clunky cartridges were king.",
      "The PlayStation \u2014 sparked by a failed partnership between Nintendo and Sony \u2014 entered a marketplace dominated by Sega and Nintendo. Sony wanted to bring the arcade experience home and a crucial decision was to consult with game developers first, before building their system.",
      "\u201cSony realized they needed developers in place from the get-go before they even started designing it,\u201d says Anthony Caulfield, who with his wife, Nicola, run Gracious Films and made the independent documentary \u201cThe PlayStation Revolution.\u201d",
      "\u201cHardware manufacturers up to that point basically didn\u2019t care what the developers wanted. They just made what they thought was the best piece of hardware,\u201d he says.",
      "Some critical steps helped right from the launch. Sony had a number of games ready to go, a development pipeline in place and a killer retail price \u2014 $299 \u2014 that was less expensive than the rival Sega Saturn.",
      "Sony also picked its market carefully, Caulfield says. With Sega and Nintendo largely targeting children, Sony aimed the PlayStation at teens and young adults \u2014 catnip for their younger brothers and sisters.",
      "\u201cIf you grew up loving Nintendo games, the PlayStation was like a really good next step,\u201d says Tyler Treese, the editor-in-chief of PlayStation LifeStyle, an online forum and news site for fans.",
      "When the console first arrived, it was a sensation, going on to sell more than 100 million units globally. \u201cIt\u2019s when games grew up,\u201d says Caulfield. \u201cIt\u2019s where the gaming went from the bedroom to the living room.\u201d",
      "Sony kept up with the technology, packing a DVD into the PlayStation 2 so that buyers had another reason to buy the system. The PlayStation 2 remains the best selling console of all time, with some 160 million units sold.",

      "Sony hit a wobble with the PS3, which used a Blu-ray deck. \u201cIt made the thing so expensive and it kind of broke that original PlayStation feeling of availability and great value for money,\u201d Caulfield says. The 2011 PlayStation network hack that shut down the network for 24 days didn't help. \u201cIf they got the PS4 wrong it could have been the end.\u201d",
      "But the PlayStation 4 in 2013 stabilized the console, offering immersive online multiplayer options, streaming services and a library of exclusive games. Sony kept going with in-app purchases, 4K resolution and a controller that has haptic feedback and adaptive triggers in the current PlayStation 5.",
      "\u201cEvery console has to have a purpose, it has to have a reason to exist, and when we find that we have the right amount of new technology that can enable developers to do great things, we push forward,\u201d says Lempel.",
      "The list of movies and TV shows that have had their origin on the PlayStation is long. It includes: \u201cUncharted\u201d starring Tom Holland on the big screen, \u201cThe Last of Us\u201d with Pedro Pascal on HBO, \u201cTwisted Metal\u201d on Peacock and \u201cGran Turismo\u201d with Orlando Bloom from Columbia Pictures.",

      "\u201cThey do really lend themselves to movies because they definitely led that charge of making more cinematic video game experiences,\u201d he says. It also doesn't help that Sony Pictures is nearby.",
      "Lempel says PlayStation franchises are finding new audiences in other media because, at base, they're good entertainment. \u201cWe have great stories, we\u2019ve got great IP, and it transcends the category.\u201d",
      "That has even spilled out into fashion \u2014 British Nigerian multidisciplinary artist and designer Yinka Ilori has a line of PlayStation-inspired loungewear \u2014 and footwear, thanks to rapper Travis Scott's Nike Dunk Low Cactus Jack X PlayStation sneakers.",
      "\u201cWe know that we\u2019ve struck a chord that goes just well beyond a consumer product,\u201d says Lempel. \u201cThis is something that people love. It\u2019s a big part of people\u2019s lives and they love to talk about it. They love to express it in different ways.\u201d",
      "Lempel recently got a taste of that expression firsthand. He was at a restaurant in Manhattan when he spotted the PlayStation symbols tattooed on someone\u2019s arm. \u201cThese are permanent markings on someone\u2019s body,\u201d he says in wonder. \u201cThat\u2019s the passion people have.\u201d",

      "A rare confluence of factors makes the Atacama an ideal home for some of the world\u2019s biggest ground-based astronomical projects \u2014 dry climate, high altitude and, crucially, isolation from the light pollution of civilization.",
      "\u201cIt's a perfect cocktail for astronomy,\u201d said Daniela Gonz\u00e1lez, executive director of the Skies of Chile Foundation, a nonprofit that defends the quality of the country\u2019s night skies.",
      "But that may not be the case for much longer, a group of leading scientists warned in an open letter to Chile\u2019s government released Tuesday.",
      "A private company is pressing ahead with plans to construct a giant renewable energy complex in sight of one of Earth\u2019s most productive astronomical facilities \u2014 the Paranal Observatory, operated by an international consortium known as the European Southern Observatory, or ESO.",
      "In the letter, 30 renowned international astronomers, including Reinhard Genzel, a 2020 Nobel laureate in astrophysics who conducted much of his prize-winning research on black holes with the ESO-operated telescopes in the Atacama Desert, describe the project as \u201can imminent threat\u201d to humanity's ability to study the cosmos, and unlock more of its unknowns.",
      "\u201cThe damage would extend beyond Chile\u2019s borders, affecting a worldwide scientific community that relies on observations made at Paranal to study everything from the formation of planets to the early universe,\u201d the letter reads.",
      "\u201cWe are convinced that economic development and scientific progress can and must coexist to the benefit of all people in Chile, but not at the irreversible expense of one of Earth\u2019s unique and irreplaceable windows to the universe.\u201d",
      "The scientists join a chorus of voices that have been urging the Chilean government to relocate the hydrogen-based fuel production plant since the plan was unveiled a year ago by AES Andes, an offshoot of the American-based multinational AES Corp.",
      "In response to a request for comment, AES Corp. said that its own technical studies showed the project would be fully compatible with astronomical observations and compliant with the Chilean government's strict regulations on light pollution.",

      "That means not only a major increase in light pollution but also new dust, ground vibrations and heightened atmospheric turbulence that blurs stars and makes them twinkle. All of that \u2014 just 3 kilometers (1.9 miles) from the Paranal Observatory\u2019s high-powered telescopes \u2014 will mess the view of key astronomical targets and could obstruct scientific advances, experts say.",
      "\u201cAt the best sites in the world for astronomy, stars don't twinkle. They are very stable, and even the smallest artificial turbulence would destroy these characteristics,\u201d said Andreas Kaufer, the director of operations at ESO, which assesses that the AES project would increase light pollution by 35%.",
      "\u201cIf the sky is becoming brighter from artificial light around us, we cannot do these observations anymore. They're lost. And, since we have the biggest and most sensitive telescopes at the best spot in the world, if they're lost for us, they're lost for everyone.\"",
      "Although this controversy might be specific to Chile, home to 40% of the world\u2019s astronomy infrastructure, the project reflects the wider tension between natural darkness and industrialization tearing at countless countries as light pollution makes the night sky about 10% brighter each year.",

      "Students applying to college know they're not supposed to use AI chatbots to write their essays",
      "Students applying to college know they can\u2019t \u2014 or at least shouldn\u2019t \u2014 use AI chatbots to write their essays and personal statements. So it might come as a surprise that some schools are now using artificial intelligence to read them.",
      "AI tools are now being incorporated into how student applications are screened and analyzed, admissions directors say. It can be a delicate topic, and not all colleges are eager to talk about it, but higher education is among the many industries where artificial intelligence is rapidly taking on tasks once reserved for humans.",
      "In some cases, schools are quietly slipping AI into their evaluation process, experts say. Others are touting the technology\u2019s potential to speed up their review of applications, cut processing times and even perform some tasks better than humans.",
      "\u201cHumans get tired; some days are better than others. The AI does not get tired. It doesn\u2019t get grumpy. It doesn\u2019t have a bad day. The AI is consistent,\u201d says Juan Espinoza, vice provost for enrollment management at Virginia Tech.",
      "This fall, Virginia Tech is debuting an AI-powered essay reader. The college expects it will be able to inform students of admissions decisions a month sooner than usual, in late January, because of the tool's help sorting tens of thousands of applications.",
      "Colleges stress they are not relying on AI to make admissions decisions, using it primarily to review transcripts and eliminate data-entry tasks. But artificial intelligence also is playing a role in evaluating students. Some highly selective schools are adopting AI tools to vet the increasingly curated application packages that some students develop with the help of high-priced admissions consultants.",
      "The California Institute of Technology is launching an AI tool this fall to look for \u201cauthenticity\u201d in students who submit research projects with their applications, admissions director Ashley Pallie said. Students upload their research to an AI chatbot that interviews them about it on video, which is then reviewed by Caltech faculty.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a gauge of authenticity. Can you claim this research intellectually? Is there a level of joy around your project? That passion is important to us,\u201d Pallie said.",
      "The prevalence of AI usage is difficult to gauge because it is such a new trend, said Ruby Bhattacharya, chair of the admission practices committee at the National Association for College Admission Counseling. NACAC updated its ethics guide this fall to add a section on artificial intelligence. It urges colleges to ensure the way they use it \u201caligns with our shared values of transparency, integrity, fairness and respect for student dignity.\u201d",
      "The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill faced a barrage of negative feedback from applicants, parents and students after its student newspaper, The Daily Tar Heel, reported in January the school was using AI to evaluate the grammar and writing style of applicants' essays.",
      "The university declined to comment for this article and referred to its admissions website, which it updated after the criticism. \u201cUNC uses AI programs to provide data points about students\u2019 common application essay and their school transcripts,\u201d the website says. Every application \u201cis evaluated comprehensively by extensively trained human application evaluators.\u201d",
      "At Virginia Tech, Espinoza said he has been contacted by several colleges that are interested in the new technology but wary of backlash. \u201cThe feedback from a lot of colleagues is, \u2018You roll this out, we\u2019re watching you, and we\u2019ll see how everyone\u2019s reacting,\u2019\u201d he said.",
      "He stressed the AI reader his school spent three years developing is being used only to confirm human readers' essay scores.",
      "Until this fall, each of the four short-answer essays Virginia Tech applicants submit was read and scored by two people. Under the new system, one of those readers is the AI model, which has been trained on past applicant essays and the rubric for scoring, Espinoza said.",

Even with 200 essay readers, the school has struggled to keep up and found itself notifying students later and later.",
      "The AI tool can scan about 250,000 essays in under an hour, compared with a human reader who averages two minutes per essay. Based on last year\u2019s application pool, \u201cWe\u2019re saving at least 8,000 hours,\u201d Espinoza said.",
      "The messaging is sensitive for colleges, many of which now have students certify that they have not used AI unethically for essays and other parts of the application. But schools say AI tools can help admissions offices eliminate errors in tasks like uploading transcripts and can simplify the process for students.",
      "Georgia Tech this fall is rolling out an AI tool to review the college transcripts of transfer students, replacing the need for staff to enter each course manually into a database. It will allow the school to inform applicants more quickly how many transfer credits they'll receive, cutting down on uncertainty and wait times, said Richard Clark, the school's executive director of enrollment management.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s one more layer of delay and stress and inevitable errors. AI is going to kill that, which I\u2019m so excited about,\u201d Clark said. The school hopes to expand the service soon to all high school transcripts. Georgia Tech also is testing out AI tools for other uses, including one that would identify low-income students who are eligible for federal Pell Grants but may not have realized it.",
      "Stony Brook University in New York is also using artificial intelligence to review applicants' transcripts and testing AI tools for a variety of tasks, like summarizing student essays and letters of recommendation to highlight things an admissions officer should consider, said Richard Beatty, the school\u2019s senior associate provost for enrollment management.",
      "\u201cMaybe a student was fighting a disease sophomore year. Or maybe a parent passed away, or they\u2019re taking care of siblings at home. All these things matter, and it allows the counselors to look at the transcript differently,\u201d Beatty said.",
      "Colleges are interested in AI summaries of transcripts, extracurricular activities and letters of recommendation that tell human readers the students\u2019 story in a more digestible way, said Emily Pacheco, founder of NACAC\u2019s special interest group for AI and admission.",
      "\u201cHumans and AI working together \u2014 that is the key right now. Every step along the way can be greatly improved: transcript reading, essay reviews, telling us things we might be missing about the students,\u201d said Pacheco, a former assistant director of admission at Loyola University Chicago. \u201cTen years from now, all bets are off. I\u2019m guessing AI will be admitting students.\u201d",

      "Louisiana is shrinking",
      "POINTE-AU-CHIEN, La. -- Cherie Matherne looked out into Bayou Pointe au Chien, wide enough for several boats to pass through. In the distance, a stand of dead trees marked where saltwater comes and goes during storm-driven flooding.",
      "It wasn't always this way. The bayou was once shallower and just wide enough for a small boat to pass. Land that cattle once roamed is submerged now, and elders tell stories of tree canopies once so lush they nearly shut out the day.",
      "The delicate lattice of Louisiana's coastline has been steadily retreating for generations. As it does, the Pointe-au-Chien Indian Tribe and other Indigenous people are fighting to protect what's left and to adapt to their changing environment. That includes a painstaking effort to build makeshift reefs that slow erosion and sturdier homes and buildings to better withstand storms.",
      "\u201cWe want to be able to make it so that people can stay here for as long as possible, for as long as they want to stay,\u201d said Matherne, who as the tribe's director of daily operations helped coordinate its response to the erosion threat.",
      "They hope to avoid the fate of the Jean Charles Choctaw Nation, a nearby tribe that was forced to move three years ago about 40 miles (64 kilometers) north from the encroaching Gulf of Mexico. Isle de Jean Charles \u2014 their island home southwest of New Orleans \u2014 has lost 98% of its land.",
      "Louisiana's coast has been steadily retreating for several reasons.",
      "Levees along the Mississippi River have severed the natural flow of land-creating sand, silt and clay, starving wetlands of sediment they need to survive. Canals have allowed saltwater to flow into wetlands, killing freshwater vegetation that holds them together and accelerating erosion. Groundwater pumping is causing land to sink, and planet-warming emissions from burning coal, oil and gas are fueling hurricanes and accelerating sea level rise.",
      "Since the 1930s, Louisiana has lost about 2,000 square miles (5,180 square kilometers) of land \u2014 sometimes fast, sometimes slow. A U.S. Geological Survey analysis found that when erosion was at its worst, a football field's worth of coastal wetlands was disappearing every 34 minutes.",
      "It\u2019s a difficult problem to solve without being able to count on the Mississippi River to periodically drop sediment to maintain the land, said Sam Bentley, geology professor at Louisiana State University.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s going to displace ecosystems, it\u2019s going to displace communities, it\u2019s going to isolate infrastructure that\u2019s along the coastline,\" Bentley said. \"And there are going to be a lot of changes that are very hard to deal with.\u201d",
      "Indigenous burial and cultural sites risk eroding, and traditional ways of life \u2014 shrimping, fishing and subsistence farming \u2014 are under pressure. Without action, researchers estimate the state could lose up to 3,000 square miles (7,770 square kilometers) \u2014 an area larger than Delaware \u2014 over the next 50 years.",
      "Reefs built from oyster shells are one attempt to stem the erosion.",
      "The oysters are collected from restaurants, stuffed into bags and stacked just off shore to form the reefs. The program, launched in 2014 by the Coalition to Restore Coastal Louisiana, has recycled more than 16 million pounds (7.3 million kilograms) of shells in that time. That's enough to protect about 1.5 miles (about 2.4 kilometers) of shoreline.",
      "Since the Pointe-au-Chien tribe had a 400-foot (123-meter) reef built in 2019 to protect a historic mound, the coalition has measured a 50% reduction in the rate of land loss where the reefs were built, said coalition spokesman James Karst.",
      "But there are limits to what reclaimed oyster shells can do. There just aren't enough shells for Louisiana's estimated 7,721-mile (12,426 kilometer) coastline, said Karst, and moving them is expensive, so they have to be strategic. Many reefs they've built protect sites of cultural importance. They're also limited to areas where the water is salty enough for the oyster shells to last.",
      "Their work might seem like a tiny drop in the bucket, \"but when you are losing land at the rate you are,\u201d Karst said, \u201cyou need all the drops in the bucket you can get.\u201d",

It was built at the Louisiana Universities Marine Consortium, a location easy for the public to see and learn about oyster reefs, said Chief Devon Parfait.",
      "When Hurricane Ida hit in 2021, it made landfall in the region with maximum sustained winds of 150 mph (241 kph).",

With help from groups like the Lowlander Center, a nonprofit working with Indigenous and coastal communities facing risks such as climate threats and land loss, the tribe is rebuilding in a stronger way.",
      "Homes are higher off the ground and fortified with hurricane straps, heavy-duty windows and doors that can take pummeling winds and waters. Electrical equipment is elevated to stay above storm surge. They've rebuilt or repaired 13 homes; about five new homes are planned and they're raising money to fortify the remaining dozen or so.",
      "\u201cWe know that doing just one home in a community doesn\u2019t make the community safe. It\u2019s only safe if the whole community is included in raising that level of safety,\u201d said Kristina Peterson, director and co-founder of the Lowlander Center.",
      "But challenges remain. The state-recognized tribes have struggled to get federal recognition, they said, and without it, it's hard to get grants and other help from the federal government. Instead, they rely on partnerships with organizations and institutions.",
      "The Trump administration's funding cuts are also making it harder for tribes to meet their goals.",
      "The Grand Caillou/Dulac Band of Biloxi-Chitimacha-Choctaw applied for a federal grant to build a community center stocked with food, water and renewable energy in case of emergencies that's designed to hold up during hurricanes. When cuts happened, their application was tabled.",
      "Similarly, the Pointe-au-Chien applied for money to install solar panels on every home, but they're not hopeful their application will get approved.",
      "Pointe-au-Chien elder Theresa Dardar said much has changed in the five decades she's lived there. The pond behind her home has gotten bigger, and she could once identify lakes Chien and Felicity. Now it\u2019s just one large body of water. People once hunted deer and walked through wooded areas.",

      "By slowing erosion and building more homes, the tribe hopes younger families will move to Pointe-au-Chien. They also know that protecting their lands from going underwater will protect regions further inland.",
      "As Dardar put it: \u201cWe're the buffer.\"",

      "The state-sanctioned hunt began Saturday, after drawing more than 160,000 applications for a far more limited number of hunting permits, including from opponents who are trying to reduce the number of bears killed in this year's hunt, the state's first since 2015.",
      "The Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission awarded 172 bear hunt permits by random lottery for this year's season, allowing hunters to kill one bear each in areas where the population is deemed large enough. At least 43 of the permits went to opponents of the hunt who never intend to use them, according to the Florida chapter of the Sierra Club, which encouraged critics to apply in the hopes of saving bears.",
      "The Florida black bear population is considered one of the state's conservation success stories, having grown from just several hundred bears in the 1970s to an estimated more than 4,000 today.",
      "Opponents have questioned whether the hunt was necessary, but they were unable to convince the courts to halt it.",
      "Here's what to know.",
      "The 172 people who were awarded a permit through a random lottery will be able to kill one bear each during the 2025 season, which runs from Dec. 6 to Dec. 28. The permits are specific to one of the state's four designated bear hunting zones, each of which have a hunting quota set by state officials based on the bear population in each region.",
      "In order to participate, hunters must hold a valid hunting license and a bear harvest permit, which costs $100 for residents and $300 for nonresidents, plus fees. Applications for the permits cost $5 each.",
      "The regulated hunt will help incentivize maintaining healthy bear populations, and help fund the work that is needed, according to Mark Barton of the Florida chapter of Backcountry Hunters and Anglers, an advocacy group that supported the hunt.",
      "Having an annual hunt will help guarantee funding to \"keep moving conservation for bears forward,\u201d Barton said.",
      "According to state wildlife officials, the bear population has grown enough to support a regulated hunt and warrant population management. The state agency sees hunting as an effective tool that is used to manage wildlife populations around the world, and allows the state to monetize conservation efforts through permit and application fees.",
      "\"While we have enough suitable bear habitat to support our current bear population levels, if the four largest subpopulations continue to grow at current rates, we will not have enough habitat at some point in the future,\" reads a bear hunting guide published by the state wildlife commission.",

      "Carrero is accused in a criminal complaint of igniting a piece of paper and dropping it near the 56-year-old passenger around 3 a.m. Monday on a northbound 3 train at the 34th Street\u2014Penn Station stop near Madison Square Garden and Macy\u2019s flagship store in midtown Manhattan.",

      "TALLAHASSEE, Fla. -- Florida\u2019s Republican-controlled House is holding the first meeting of its select committee on congressional redistricting Thursday, as the state becomes the latest to consider redrawing electoral maps amid a partisan battle for every edge in next year\u2019s midterm elections.",
      "The national wave of redistricting efforts was instigated by President Donald Trump, who hopes to buck the historical trend of the president\u2019s party losing seats in midterms, and his allies are wagering that his adopted home state could yield three to five more seats for Republicans. Each seat is crucial, because Democrats need a net gain of just three to control the chamber.",
      "But the push for redistricting faces major challenges in Florida due to bitter infighting between Republican Gov.

      "CARROLLTON, Ga. -- Republican Lt. Gov. Burt Jones is allowed to loan $10 million to his campaign for governor, Georgia's ethics panel said Thursday.",
      "Attorney General Chris Carr, who is running against Jones, alleged it evaded campaign finance restrictions. But Georgia Ethics Commission decided in a meeting in Carrollton, Georgia, that a loan to a leadership committee counts as a contribution under state law, adopting a legal opinion that there is \u201cnothing in the current statute which prohibits such a loan of personal funds.\u201d",
      "The opinion clears Jones to keep spending his family fortune to pursue the Republican nomination. Carr and Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger are the other two top candidates in the GOP governor's primary. They're vying to succeed Gov. Brian Kemp, who legally can\u2019t run again after two terms, along with numerous Democrats.",
      "Republican and Democratic primaries are in May, followed by the general election in November 2026.",
      "Under a 2021 state law, leadership committees can raise unlimited funds, can coordinate with candidates and can raise funds during legislative sessions when other fundraising is banned. But candidates can't establish leadership committees until they win their party\u2019s nomination for governor or lieutenant governor.",
      "Instead, they are limited to candidate committees, which can raise a maximum of $8,400 from each donor. As the incumbent lieutenant governor, Jones controls a leadership committee, as does Kemp.",
      "Rosario Palacios, executive director of liberal-leaning watchdog group Common Cause Georgia, said the decision only reinforces the injustice of leadership committees.",

      "Jones filed documents showing he made loans of $7.5 million and $2.5 million to the WBJ Leadership Committee when he announced his run for governor on July 8.",
      "Carr argued that under Georgia law, loans could be made only to a candidate committee, not to a freestanding political action committee or leadership committee.",

      "Jones\u2019 campaign did not respond to the substance of the ruling, with spokesperson Kayla Lott only characterizing Carr as being \u201cbad at being a lawyer.\u201d",
      "Carr announced his run for governor last year, saying he needed to raise money because he isn\u2019t personally wealthy. Like Jones, Raffensperger has substantial personal wealth. Supporters of Carr have established an independent committee, but it can't coordinate with Carr's campaign.",
      "Carr also sued in federal court to try to block Jones\u2019 use his leadership committee. But in August, U.S. District Judge Victoria Marie Calvert dismissed the lawsuit, ruling that Carr should have challenged the constitutionality of the law. She said it was wrong to sue Jones and his campaign for \u201cdoing exactly what Georgia law allows them to do.\u201d",

      "In a series of cables sent this week to all U.S. diplomatic missions that were obtained by The Associated Press, the State Department said visa applications for businesspeople considering \u201csignificant investments\u201d in the United States should be at the top of the list for consideration along with applications from those wanting to travel \u201cfor major sporting events which showcase American excellence.\u201d",

      "As part of a broader initiative to control the entry of foreigners into the U.S., the State Department has said all those who require visas to enter the country would need to submit to an in-person interview and screening to vet them for potential national security risks.",
      "This has led to lengthy wait times at many embassies and consulates for interviews to apply for what are known as \u201cB1\u201d and \u201cB2\u201d visas despite a surge in consular staffing.",
      "Last month, Trump announced a new initiative, dubbed \u201cFIFA Pass,\u201d for foreigners traveling to the U.S. for the World Cup that will allow them to get interviews for visas more quickly. Nonetheless, he still encouraged them to apply for their visas \u201cright away.\u201d",

      "Proof of this could be obtained from an applicant\u2019s resume, employment history, social media profiles and posts, and public statements or writings, the cable said, adding that the State Department was developing tools to make it easier and quicker to conduct these screenings.",

      "\u201cYou must thoroughly explore their employment histories to ensure no participation in such activities,\u201d the cable said, adding that \u201cif you uncover evidence and applicant was responsible for or complicit in censorship or attempted censorship of protected expression in the United States you should pursue a finding that the applicant is ineligible\u201d for a visa.",

The animal was captured by the camera as it visited a watering hole in November, its distinctive spots setting it apart from previous sightings.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re very excited. It signifies this edge population of jaguars continues to come here because they\u2019re finding what they need,\" Susan Malusa, director of the center's jaguar and ocelot project, said during an interview Thursday.",
      "The team is now working to collect scat samples to conduct genetic analysis and determine the sex and other details about the new jaguar, including what it likes to eat. The menu can include everything from skunks and javelina to small deer.",
      "As an indicator species, Malusa said the continued presence of big cats in the region suggests a healthy landscape but that climate change and border barriers can threaten migratory corridors. She explained that warming temperatures and significant drought increase the urgency to ensure connectivity for jaguars with their historic range in Arizona.",
      "More than 99% of the jaguar\u2019s range is found in Central and South America, and the few male jaguars that have been spotted in the U.S. are believed to have dispersed from core populations in Mexico, according to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.

      "Two New York City police officers won't be charged in the shooting death of a 19-year-old during a mental crisis last year",
      "Two New York City police officers won't be charged in the shooting death of a 19-year-old man during a mental health crisis last year as his mother and brother begged the officers not to open fire, state Attorney General Letitia James' office said Thursday.",
      "Win Rozario was shot five times by the officers at his family's home in Queens on March 27, 2024, as he came at them while holding scissors in his hand, police body camera video showed. A person in the home had called 911 and told a dispatcher \u201cI think my son is on drugs and is acting mad erratic,\" according to police.",
      "The Office of Special Investigation in James' office concluded in its report that \u201ca prosecutor would not be able to disprove beyond a reasonable doubt that the officers\u2019 use of deadly force against Mr. Rozario was justified and, therefore, will not seek charges.\u201d",
      "The report also said that the reasonableness of the fear the officers, Salvatore Alongi and Matthew Cianfrocco, had when Rozario came at them with the scissors could not be disproven beyond a reasonable doubt. Both officers, however, still face an internal discipline trial on excessive force allegations by the city's Civilian Complaint Review Board, as well as a lawsuit by Rozario's family.",
      "Rozario's mother, Notan Eva Costa, his father, Francis Rozario, and his brother, Utsho Rozario, criticized the decision not to prosecute the officers.",
      "\u201cState Attorney General Letitia James\u2019 cowardly decision not to indict NYPD Officers Matthew Cianfrocco and Salvatore Alongi for murdering our beloved son and brother, Win Rozario, feels like we\u2019re watching Win get murdered all over again,\" they said in a statement released by the Justice Committee advocacy group.",
      "\u201cWe were safe in our home until Officers Cianfrocco and Alongi walked in and created chaos,\u201d they said. \u201cThe NYPD should not be engaging with people experiencing a mental health episode.\u201d",
      "The attorney general's office did not immediately respond to a request for reaction to the family's comments Thursday evening.",
      "The Office of Special Investigation's report recommends expanding citywide a pilot program that dispatches paramedics and mental health professionals as first responders to mental health emergency calls. It also recommends more training for officers on responding to such calls. And it says the state should enact a law allowing public health-based responses to people experiencing a mental health, alcohol use or substance use crisis.",
      "Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani's platform includes expanding mental health services across the city, including having health professionals respond to mental health crises reported in 911 calls.",
      "\u201cWin Rozario\u2019s death was a senseless tragedy that brought pain to so many New Yorkers, most of all his loved ones,\" Mamdani said in a statement Thursday.",

      "After the officers entered Rozario's home, Rozario grabbed a pair of scissors in the kitchen and took a few quick steps toward the officers, prompting one of them to fire a Taser, the police body camera video showed. Razario's mother then wrested the scissors away while holding onto him and police ordered her to get out of their way, prompting her to plea \u201cDon't shoot\" as she put the scissors on a chair and stepped aside.",

      "MORRO BAY, Calif. -- On a jagged coastline in Central California, brown pelicans gather on rock promontories, packed in like edgy commuters as they take flight to feed on a vast school of fish just offshore. The water churns in whitecaps as the big-billed birds plunge beneath the surface in search of northern anchovies, Pacific sardines and mackerel.",
      "If awkward and wobbly in appearance on land, they are graceful once airborne. The signature pouch dangling beneath the lower bill can scoop up to 3 gallons of water with every dip into the ocean \u2014 the largest pouch of any bird in the world.",
      "It is what scientists call a \u201cfeeding frenzy.\u201d And it is an encouraging sign for a bird that has struggled in recent years with a warming ocean, inconsistent breeding patterns and toxic algae blooms in Southern California.",
      "\u201cI would say the populations are somewhat stable, but some events are concerning,\u201d says marine ornithologist Tammy Russell, a postdoctoral researcher at the University of California, San Diego, Scripps Institution of Oceanography.",
      "The gorging seabirds are a \u201cgood sign for the marine environment,\u201d Russell said.",
      "On this warm, clear day, thousands of birds have populated the nearby beaches and cliffs, drawn by the abundant food. Cormorants and gulls mix with the pelicans. The incessant roar of the waves and the chorus of bird cries are all that can be heard on this jutting jawbone of coast.",
      "The bird\u2019s range along the Pacific coast extends from British Columbia, Canada, into Mexico. In their struggle for survival, Russell notes that the California brown pelican was once on the federal endangered species list, after a sharp population decline was attributed to the pesticide DDT, which causes eggshell thinning. The population recovered, and the bird was removed from the list in 2009, though it still faces multiple challenges.",

      "The nation's freight railroads are going to be able to try relying more on technology and inspect their tracks in person less often after the federal government approved their waiver request on Friday.",
      "The Association of American Railroads trade group asked for the relief from inspection requirements that were written back in 1971 because railroads believe the automated track inspection technology they use today is so good at spotting problems early that human inspections aren't needed as frequently. They say that extended tests that BNSF and Norfolk Southern ran show that safety actually improved even when human inspections were reduced from twice a week to twice a month.",
      "The Federal Railroad Administration didn't go quite that far in its decision, but the agency said railroads will be able to cut inspections down to only once a week under the approved waiver.",
      "The railroads had also asked for permission to have up to three days to repair defects identified by the automated inspections. But the Federal Railroad Administration said any serious defects in the tracks must be repaired immediately and all defects should be addressed within 24 hours.",
      "These automated inspection systems use an array of cameras and lasers installed either on a locomotive or on a railcar that can be pulled as part of a train to assess whether the tracks are moving out of alignment or shifting. But the union that represents track inspectors says the technology can\u2019t detect things like the rock underneath the track shifting, vegetation growing into the path of the trains, a crack in the rail or railroad ties rotting out. Plus, inspectors can spot a combination of small defects that might together derail a train where the machine might not register a problem, the union says.",
      "\u201cThis is everyday defects across the entire country that we find through visual inspections that cannot be detected by this machinery,\u201d Brotherhood of Maintenance of Way Employes Division union President Tony Cardwell said. \u201cAnd that technology is not there. It has been here for 30 years. It hasn\u2019t really advanced much at all. It\u2019s a glorified tape measure.\u201d",
      "The Brotherhood of Maintenance of Way Employes Division union that represents track inspectors acknowledges that this technology does help spot problems. But the union says that this automated inspection equipment should supplement \u2014 not replace \u2014 human inspections because reducing track inspections would increase the risk of derailments.",
      "The railroads counter that even if these systems can't see the ballast shifting under the tracks or the ties starting to rot, the system will notice the symptoms of those problems because the track geometry \u2014 basically the alignment of the tracks \u2014 will be affected when those things happen.",
      "\u201cWhat it is looking at is the ultimate performance. If those components are doing their job, then the track geometry is being maintained. If they\u2019re not doing their job, the track geometry is not being maintained,\u201d said Mike Rush, the Association of American Railroads' senior vice president of safety and operations.",

      "BNSF railroad said when it was arguing with the Federal Railroad Administration about whether their test should be extended that the \u201ctechnology has proven to be far more sensitive and effective at detecting geometry defects on BNSF\u2019s network than the regime of manual visual inspections mandated by the historic regulations.\u201d",
      "Over two years of testing, manual inspections detected only 0.01 defects per 100 miles, compared with the section of the railroad where the test was being run where the combination of the technology and reduced inspections found 4.54 defects per 100 miles.",
      "The Federal Railroad Administration agreed that tracks don't need to be inspected visually as frequently when these automated track inspection systems are used regularly.",
      "Cardwell and the union's safety director, Roy Morrison, think that's a bad idea. They said that one of the benefits of frequent inspections is that the inspectors become intimately familiar with their territories, which helps them spot subtle changes. If they aren't out on the tracks as often, it may be harder to spot problems, they said.",
      "\u201cA track inspector who\u2019s out on his mainline track twice a week, he knows that track inside out, and a lot of times he\u2019ll spot a defect without even knowing what he\u2019s looking at yet,\u201d Morrison said. \u201cHe\u2019ll get out of the truck and say, hey, there\u2019s something wrong here. Take some measurements and go, OK, this is what\u2019s going on.\u201d",
      "But the railroads say that freeing up inspectors from some of these mandated track inspections will allow them to focus more on switches and other equipment that must be inspected manually. Plus, Norfolk Southern noted in its comments on the request that even if regular inspections aren't being done as often, special inspections will still be done regularly anytime there is a major storm or flooding in a certain area to make sure the tracks weren't affected.",
      "Norfolk Southern said that during its 18-month test of reducing inspections while using the technology, the railroad saw improvements in areas that the automated system can't find because inspectors were free to spend more time focused on those areas.",

      "The Navy admiral who reportedly issued orders to fire upon survivors of an attack on an alleged drug boat is set to brief Congress",
      "WASHINGTON -- The Navy admiral who reportedly issued orders for the U.S. military to fire upon survivors of an attack on an alleged drug boat is expected Thursday on Capitol Hill to provide a classified briefing to top congressional lawmakers overseeing national security.",
      "The information from Adm. Frank \u201cMitch\u201d Bradley, who is now the commander of U.S. Special Operations Command, comes at a potentially crucial moment in the unfolding congressional investigation into how Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth handled the military operation in international waters near Venezuela. There are mounting questions over whether the strike may have violated the law.",
      "Lawmakers are seeking a full accounting of the strikes after The Washington Post reported that Bradley on Sept. 2 ordered an attack on two survivors to comply with Hegseth's directive to \u201ckill everybody.\u201d Legal experts say the attack amounts to a crime if the survivors were targeted, and lawmakers on both sides of the aisle are demanding accountability.",
      "Bradley will speak to a handful of top congressional leaders, including the Republican chairs and ranking Democrats of the House and Senate committees on Armed Services, and separately to the GOP chairman and Democratic vice chairman on the Senate Intelligence Committee.",
      "\u201cThis is an incredibly serious matter. This is about the safety of our troops. This is an incident that could expose members of our armed services to legal consequences,\u201d Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York said in a floor speech Wednesday. \u201cAnd yet the American public and the Congress are still not hearing basic facts.\u201d",
      "As Bradley appears for questions in the classified setting, lawmakers will be seeking answers to key questions: What orders did Hegseth give regarding the operations? And what was the reasoning for the second strike?",
      "Democratic lawmakers are also demanding that the Trump administration release the full video of the Sept. 2 attack, as well as written records of the orders and any directives from Hegseth. While Republicans, who control the national security committees, have not publicly called for those documents, they have pledged a thorough review.",
      "\u201cThe investigation is going to be done by the numbers,\u201d said Sen. Roger Wicker of Mississippi, the chair of the Senate Armed Services Committee. \u201cWe\u2019ll find out the ground truth.\u201d",
      "President Donald Trump has stood behind Hegseth as he defends his handling of the attack, but pressure is mounting on the defense secretary.",
      "Hegseth has said the aftermath of an initial strike on the boat was clouded in the \u201cfog of war.\u201d He has also said he \u201cdidn\u2019t stick around\u201d for the second strike, but said Bradley \u201cmade the right call\u201d and \u201chad complete authority\u201d to do it.",
      "Also on Thursday, the Defense Department inspector general was expected to release a partially redacted report into Hegseth's use of the Signal messaging app in March to share information about a military strike against Yemen\u2019s Houthi militants.",
      "The report found that Hegseth put U.S. personnel and their mission at risk by using Signal, according to two people familiar with the findings. The Pentagon, however, has cast the report as an exoneration of Hegseth.",
      "At the time of the attack, Bradley was the commander of Joint Special Operations Command, overseeing coordinated operations between the military's elite special operations units out of Fort Bragg in North Carolina. About a month after the strike, he was promoted to commander of U.S. Special Operations Command.",

He was among the first special forces officers to deploy to Afghanistan after the Sept. 11 attacks. His latest promotion to admiral was approved by unanimous voice vote in the Senate earlier this year, and Democratic and Republican senators praised his record.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m expecting Bradley to tell the truth and shed some light on what actually happened,\u201d said Virginia Sen. Mark Warner, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, adding that he had \u201cgreat respect for his record.\u201d",
      "Sen. Thom Tillis, a North Carolina Republican, described Bradley as among those who are \u201crock solid\u201d and \u201cthe most extraordinary people that have ever served in the military.\u201d",
      "But lawmakers like Tillis have also made it clear they expect a reckoning if it is found that survivors were targeted. \u201cAnybody in the chain of command that was responsible for it, that had vision of it, needs to be held accountable,\u201d he said.",
      "The scope of the investigation is unclear, but there is other documentation of the strike that could fill in what happened. Obtaining that information, though, will largely depend on action from Republican lawmakers \u2014 a potentially painful prospect for them if it puts them at odds with the president.",
      "Sen. Jack Reed, the top Democrat on the Armed Services Committee, said he and Wicker have formally requested the executive orders authorizing the operations and the complete videos from the strikes. They are also seeking the intelligence that identified the vessels as legitimate targets, the rules of engagement for the attacks and any criteria used to determine who was a combatant and who was a civilian.",
      "Military officials were aware that there were survivors in the water after the initial strike but carried out the follow-on strike under the rationale that it needed to sink the vessel, according to two people familiar with the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity. What remains unclear \u2014 and what lawmakers hope to clarify in their briefing with Bradley \u2014 was who ordered the strikes and whether Hegseth was involved, one of the people said.",
      "Republican lawmakers who are close to Trump have sought to defend Hegseth this week, standing behind the military campaign against drug cartels that the president deems \u201cnarco-terrorists.\u201d",
      "\u201cI see nothing wrong with what took place,\u201d said Sen. Markwayne Mullin, an Oklahoma Republican, as he argued that the Trump administration was justified in using war powers against drug cartels.",
      "More than 80 people have been killed in the series of strikes that started in September. And for critics of the campaign like Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., the pressing questions about the legality of killing survivors are a natural outgrowth of military action that was always on shaky legal ground. He said it was clear that Hegseth is responsible, even if he didn't explicitly order a second attack.",
      "\u201cHe may not have been in the room, but he was in the loop,\u201d Blumenthal said. \u201cAnd it was his order that was instrumental and foreseeably resulted in the deaths of these survivors.\u201d",

      "The focus in the murder trial of Brian Walshe turned Thursday to an affair his wife was having before he allegedly killed and dismembered her on New Year\u2019s Day 2023.",
      "Ana Walshe, a real estate agent who immigrated from Serbia, was last seen early on Jan. 1, 2023, following a New Year\u2019s Eve dinner at her Massachusetts home. Her body has never been found. Her husband, Brian Walshe faces a first-degree murder charge, after agreeing to plead guilty last month to lesser charges of misleading police and willfully disposing of a human body in violation of state law.",
      "William Fastow told the court on the fourth day of the trial that he met Ana Walshe in March 2022 when he sold her a townhouse in Washington, D.C. He said the relationship quickly intensified as they became close friends and confidants and eventually had an \"intimate relationship.\u201d They went out to dinner and to bars together, he said, and she would spend time on his sailboat and stay overnight at his home. They also took a Thanksgiving trip to Ireland.",
      "Fastow testified he never tried to keep their relationship secret and told others about their relationship, though he admitted they never socialized with her friends. They did, however, discuss telling Brian Walshe about it.",
      "\u201cAna felt it was really important that when Brian was to find about relationship that he would hear it from her,\u201d Fastow said. \u201cShe had expressed great concern and I think she felt it would be a strike against her integrity if he found out a different way.\u201d",
      "Fastow said the pair spent Christmas Eve together with friends and had planned to celebrate New Year's together on Jan. 4, when they would discuss their plans for the future.",
      "\u201cWe'd had a number of conversations about what a life together might look like, what merging two families would look like,\u201d he testified. \u201cBut I'd always said to Ana that she needed to figure out how she wanted things with Brian and what she wanted that to look for her life before we could make any commitments or decisions.\u201d",
      "Fastow said his last contact with Ana Walshe was a text message from her on New Year's Eve. The following day he sent her a photo of Fastow showing his son how to ski, a waving hand emoji, question mark query and a few more text messages the following days that got no response. He tried calling her several times on Jan. 2 but the calls went straight to voicemail. Then, on Jan. 4, he got a call from Brian Walshe, but let it go to voicemail because he was in an \u201cintimate relationship with his wife.\u201d",
      "\u201cI had not heard from her in several days and, frankly, I was concerned maybe he had found out and was calling to confront me,\" he testified.",
      "Walshe called Fastow a second time, and his voicemail was played in court. In a somewhat upbeat tone, Walshe said he \u201choped all was going well\u201d with Fastow before saying he was \u201creaching out to anybody he could\u201d because \u201cAna hadn't been in touch for a few days\" and that he was wondering if Fastow \u201chad spoken to her recently.\" Walshe then apologized for the call and said he was sure \u201ceverything was fine.\u201d",

      "This year's recipients are actor Sylvester Stallone, singers Gloria Gaynor and George Strait, the rock band Kiss and actor-singer Michael Crawford.",
      "Mr. Trump said they are a group of \"incredible people\" who represent the \"very best in American arts and culture\" and that, \"I know most of them and I've been a fan of all of them.\"",

      "Mr. Trump ignored the Kennedy Center and its premier awards program during his first term as president. But the Republican has instituted a series of changes\u00a0since returning to office in January, most notably ousting its board of trustees and replacing them with GOP supporters who voted him in as chair of the board. That triggered a number of artists to\u00a0cancel performances and some staff members resigned.",

      "It's a gold disc etched on one side with the Kennedy Center's image and rainbow colors. The honoree's name appears on the reverse side with the date of the ceremony. The medallion hangs from a navy blue ribbon and replaces a large rainbow ribbon decorated with three gold plates that rested on the honoree's shoulders and chest.",
      "Strait, wearing a cowboy hat, was first to receive his medal. When the country singer started to take off the hat, Mr. Trump said, \"If you want to leave it on, you can. I think we can get it through.\" But Strait took it off.",
      "The president said Crawford was a \"great star of Broadway\" for his lead role in the long-running \"Phantom of the Opera.\" Of Gaynor, he said, \"We have the disco queen, and she was indeed, and nobody did it like Gloria Gaynor.\"",
      "Mr. Trump was effusive about his friend Stallone, calling him a \"wonderful\" and \"spectacular\" person and \"one of the true, great movie stars\" and \"one of the great legends.\"",
      "Kiss is an \"incredible rock band,\" he said.",
      "Songs by honorees Gaynor and Kiss played in the Rose Garden just outside the Oval Office as members of the White House press corps waited nearby for Mr. Trump to begin the ceremony.",
      "The president said in August that he was \"about 98% involved\" in choosing the 2025 honorees when he personally announced them at the Kennedy Center, the first slate chosen under his leadership. The honorees traditionally had been announced by press release.",
      "It was unclear how they were chosen. Before Mr. Trump, it fell to a bipartisan selection committee.",
      "\"These are among the greatest artists, actors and performers of their generation. The greatest that we've seen,\" Mr. Trump said. \"We can hardly imagine the country music phenomena without its king of country, or American disco without its first lady, or Broadway without its phantom \u2014 and that was a phantom, let me tell you \u2014 or rock and roll without its hottest band in the world, and that's what they are, or Hollywood without one of its greatest visionaries.\"",
      "\"Each of you has made an indelible mark on American life and together you have defined entire genres and set new standards for the performing arts,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "Mr. Trump was also attending an annual State Department dinner for the honorees on Saturday. In years past, the honorees received their medallions there but Trump moved the ceremony to the White House.",
      "Meanwhile, the glitzy Kennedy Center Honors program and its series of tribute speeches and performances for each recipient is set to be taped on Sunday at the performing arts center for broadcast later in December on CBS and Paramount+. Mr. Trump is to attend the program for the first time as president, accompanied by his wife, first lady Melania Trump.",
      "The president said in August that he had agreed to host the show, and he seemed to confirm on Saturday that he would do so, predicting that the broadcast would garner its highest ratings ever as a result. Presidents traditionally attend the program and sit with the honorees in the audience. None has ever served as host.",
      "He said he looked forward to Sunday's celebration.",
      "\"It's going to be something that I believe, and I'm going to make a prediction: this will be the highest-rated show that they've ever done and they've gotten some pretty good ratings, but there's nothing like what's going to happen tomorrow night,\" Mr. Trump said.",

    "published": "Sat, 06 Dec 2025 08:07:09 -0500",
    "summary": "Nardiz Cooke was immediately transfixed by the mask she wore while receiving treatment for late-stage cancer.",
    "story": [
      "Nardiz Cooke was alarmed when she felt a lump in her right breast in late 2018. Her OB-GYN wasn't: Cooke was 38 and had no family history of cancer. Cooke's doctor diagnosed her with fibrosis, a common condition that causes tissue to feel lumpy.",
      "Cooke was reassured, but almost two years later, new symptoms began. She had splitting headaches. She said she was \"vomiting out of the blue.\" Her ears rang. She had double vision and sometimes lost her sight. Once, it took 40 minutes for her vision to return.",
      "But no matter how many doctors Cooke saw, everything came back clear. In October 2021, she went to the emergency room and refused to leave without an answer.",
      "\"After several exams, again, my sight, ears, everything you can imagine, the doctor said, 'You're fine.' I said, 'Doctor, I'm not fine,'\" Cooke recalled.",
      "The doctor ordered an MRI. It showed she had aggressive cancer. Soon after, she was given an official diagnosis: Stage IV metastatic breast cancer that had spread to her brain.",
      "\"It made sense, something about those words \u2014 that was the path that felt right,\" Cooke said.",
      "As she learned about her options, Cooke said she didn't want to focus on worst-case scenarios.",
      "\"It felt like, well, Nardiz, here you go. This is your fate. What are you going to do with it?\"",
      "Focusing on a \"trophy\"",
      "Cooke let herself be swept along the \"pink carpet\" of breast cancer treatment. People who are initially diagnosed with Stage IV cancer often have a poorer prognosis than someone who is diagnosed with earlier-stage disease that grows, said Dr. Carmen Calfa, Cooke's medical oncologist at the University of Miami's Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center. Medical advancements and tailored therapies can extend a patient's lifespan, Calfa said, but treatment is lifelong.",
      "Radiation oncologist Dr. Jessica Meshman targeted the tumors in Cooke's brain with radiation therapy. On her first day of treatment, Cooke was intrigued by the custom-fit thermoplastic mask that would direct radiation beams and protect healthy tissue.",
      "\"I saw that thing, that mask, and I said, 'I cannot wait to be done with these treatments, because I'm going to take my mask home, as a symbol, like it's my trophy,\" Cooke said.",
      "Cooke received multiple forms of radiation over two years. When she was feeling claustrophobic inside the spaceship-like machine that delivered the treatment or feeling fatigued and achy at home, she thought about what she would do with the mask when it was no longer needed.",
      "\"This amazing symbol of strength\"",
      "Cooke had her final radiation treatment in late 2022. She had two masks. Several months after finishing treatment, she splurged on quartz crystals.",
      "\"I had no idea. I had no money, but I just bought all these crystals,\" Cooke said. \"I found myself just draping (the mask), adorning (it) in quartz.\"",
      "Cooke thought the glittering results looked like something from a movie or a dream. The next time Cooke met with Meshman, she showed the doctor her photos of the mask. Meshman reached out to administrators at the cancer center to see if Cooke's mask could be displayed there. It was put in the lobby this autumn.",
      "\"I just thought it would be so incredible for other patients to see kind of the strength that she has through the piece,\" Meshman said. \"She took something that can be quite terrifying and made it this amazing symbol of strength.\"",
      "Cooke's project grew as other patients began anonymously donating their masks. She named the collection \"Radiant Sentinels.\" Each mask was a fresh canvas.",
      "\"I have learned so much from each mask, because each mask is a different material, and I research the materials, and they take me to stories, to knowledge. It's very, very interesting,\" Cooke said. \"And I respect the process very much, because that mask, the person that donated that mask, doesn't even know. But I respect them and I wish them the best.\"",
      "\"Never thought of doing something like this\"",
      "Four years after her diagnosis, Cooke, 44, is \"doing amazing,\" Meshman said. Calfa said Cooke is \"blossoming\" and that her ongoing hormone therapy treatment is going well.",
      "Cooke said she follows a four-step regimen: Taking her medication, going to her regular appointments with Calfa and Meshman, working on \"Radiant Sentinels,\" and enjoying a regular glass of red wine.",
      "Cooke's pieces were shown at a Miami gallery on Thursday. Twelve masks \u2014 two of Cooke's and 10 from donors \u2014 were showcased. Calfa and Meshman both attended.",
      "One mask shines with thousands of mirrored glass shards, while another is inspired by a tribal dance from Cooke's hometown in northern Mexico and adorned with naturally shed deer antlers. Another is studded with thousands of tiny religious figures called milagritos.",
      "Other masks are coated in fish scales and seashells. One resembled a knight's helmet wrought with leaves.",
      "Seeing all of the masks gathered and on display was momentous, said Cooke, who comes from a family of artists, but this was her first such effort.",
      "\"I would have never thought of doing something like this with my hands,\" Cooke said. \"I don't have to tell anybody how to feel when they see this. It's their own reflection, their own sight. I am just handing them a candle for them to have their experience with a mask, one-on-one.\"",
      "Cooke said she is continuing to solicit donated masks and will continue to add to the \"Radiant Sentinels\" collection. Cancer changed what she thought her life would look like, but she said it also gave her a new purpose.",
      "\"I'm 44, and I went into full menopause at 40,\" Cooke said. \"That was difficult, but I just gave in. That made a lot of the decisions for me. I did not have any kids. I realized, 'You're not here to have kids. You're here to be an auntie, and you're here to make 'Radiant Sentinels.'\"",

    "published": "Fri, 05 Dec 2025 19:55:34 -0500",
    "summary": "Netflix on Friday said it will acquire Warner Bros., including its film and television studios, HBO Max and HBO.",
    "story": [
      "Netflix on Friday said it is buying Warner Bros. in a deal valued at $82.7 billion, merging the biggest streaming service with a storied studio that has produced films such as \"Casablanca\" and the \"Harry Potter\" franchise.",
      "In a statement, Netflix said the deal is expected to close after Warner Bros. Discovery spins off its television networks division, Discovery Global, which is now expected to be completed in the third quarter of 2026.",
      "Netflix said it will buy Warner Bros. for $27.75 per share, giving the deal an equity value of $72 billion and a total enterprise value of $82.7 billion. The transaction is expected to close in 12 to 18 months, Netflix said.",
      "The agreement comes after Warner Bros. Discovery, the parent of Warner, had announced in June that it planned to split in two, dividing its cable networks such as CNN and TNT Sports from its streaming and studios business, including HBO Max and Warner Bros. Television.",
      "But in October, Warner Bros. Discovery said it had attracted interest from companies about buying all or parts of it outright, with the Wall Street Journal reporting that media and entertainment businesses, including Paramount Skydance (the parent company of CBS News) and Comcast Corp., were also pursuing a deal for Warner Bros.",
      "According to media reports, Paramount Skydance was interested in acquiring all of Warner Bros., including its cable assets such as CNN and Discovery.",
      "Why Netflix wants Warner Bros.",
      "Buying Warner Bros.' studios would mark a major strategic shift for Netflix, experts said. Although Netflix already produces original programming, including hit shows such as \"Stranger Things,\" the acquisition would boost its ability to create content, while also giving it control of Warner Bros.' 102-year-old catalogue, analysts noted.",
      "Netflix \"will cement itself as the Goliath of streaming,\" said Mike Proulx, a vice president of research at Forrester. \"This deal changes the calculus of the streaming wars, representing a seismic shift in the entertainment industry.\"",
      "The enlarged company's greater scale could also help Netflix in negotiating with advertisers and partners, market research firm MKI Global said in a report. Adding Warner Bros.' studio and streaming business would give Netflix \"a larger flow of premium films and series, reduces hit-rate risk and gives the combined group firmer control over how each title earns through its cycle,\" the market research firm added.",
      "The deal also comes as Netflix competes with streaming rival YouTube, which is growing at a faster pace, according to Lightshed Partners analyst Rich Greenfield.",
      "\"Ultimately, investors need to assess whether Netflix is making this deal in a 'rare opportunity' to accelerate its growth or if it is truly more of a defensive move to limit its peers from getting stronger and increasing competition,\" analysts with MoffettNathanson Research, an investment advisory firm focused on tech, telecom and media, said in a research note.",
      "A streaming app to rule them all?",
      "In a conference call with investors to discuss the acquisition, Netflix executives said the deal will help the company attract more subscribers, while also creating value for shareholders.",
      "\"We expect to attract and maintain more subscribers, and drive incremental revenue and operating income,\" co-CEO Greg Peters said on the call.\u00a0 \"We think it'll accelerate our business for decades to come.\"",
      "Peters was also questioned about his comments at an October conference, when he said that big media mergers \"don't have an amazing track record.\" On Friday, the executive said he believed this merger would prove to be different because of Netflix's expertise in creating content.",
      "\"A lot of those failures [are] because the company doing the acquisition didn't understand the entertainment business,\" he said. \"We understand the business.\"",
      "Analysts said Netflix would benefit by adding Warner Bros.' extensive streaming and film content.",
      "\"The rationale for such a deal stems from merging two overlapping streaming offers into a single flagship Netflix app or a tight Netflix-HBO Max bundle, with one login, one discovery layer and one advertising system,\" MKI said.",
      "Potential regulatory hurdles",
      "Under the proposed deal, Netflix pledged to honor any contractual agreements for releasing Warner Bros.' studio films. Yet the streaming giant could face regulatory hurdles in seeking to complete the deal amid concerns the transaction could weaken competition among theaters, Wall Street analysts said.",
      "\"Significant concerns have been voiced over the potential impact to the theatrical market should Netflix take over [Warner Bros.],\" analysts with Wedbush Securities said in a note to investors, adding that \"concerns remain within the industry and among government officials\" about the impact of such a deal.",
      "Some lawmakers on Friday also raised concerns that Netflix's dominance in streaming could lead to higher prices for consumers.",
      "\"Allowing Netflix to buy Warner Bros. and control access to almost half of streaming subscribers means it could get more expensive to watch your favorite movies and shows,\" Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat from Massachusetts, said on social media.",
      "Shares of Warner Bros., whose stock price has more than doubled since this summer as speculation of a possible deal heated up, gained $1.54, or 6.3%, to close the day at $26.08. Netflix shares fell $2.98, or 2.9%, to $100.24.",

    "story": [
      "Frank Gehry, the renowned architect who was known for designing the Guggenheim Museum Bilbao in Spain and the Walt Disney Concert Hall in Los Angeles, has died, a representative confirmed to CBS News. He was 96.",
      "Gehry died Friday in his home in Santa Monica, California, after a brief respiratory illness, Meaghan Lloyd, his chief of staff at Gehry Partners LLP, told CBS News in an email.",
      "He won every major prize that architecture has to offer, including the field's top honor, the Pritzker Architecture Prize, for what has been described as \"refreshingly original and totally American\" work.",
      "Gehry's fascination with modern pop art led to the creation of some of the most wildly imaginative buildings ever constructed and brought him a measure of worldwide acclaim seldom afforded any architect.",
      "In addition to Spain's Guggenheim Museum and LA's Walt Disney Concert Hall, his many masterpieces include Berlin's DZ Bank Building and an expansion of Facebook's Northern California headquarters at the insistence of the company's CEO, Mark Zuckerberg. He also designed the Jay Pritzker Pavilion in Chicago's Millennium Park and the BP Pedestrian Bridge, which connects Millennium Park to Maggie Daley Park.",
      "Other honors include the Royal Institute of British Architects gold medal, the Americans for the Arts lifetime achievement award and his native country's highest honor, the Companion of the Order of Canada.",
      "Years after he stopped designing ordinary looking buildings, word surfaced in 2006 that the pedestrian Santa Monica mall project that had led to his career epiphany might be headed for the wrecking ball. Gehry admirers were aghast, but the man himself was amused.",
      "\"They're going to tear it down now and build the kind of original idea I had,\" he said with a laugh.",
      "Eventually the mall was remodeled, giving it a more contemporary, airy outdoor look. Still, it's no Gehry masterpiece.",
      "Gehry, meanwhile, continued to work well into his 80s, turning out heralded buildings that remade skylines around the world.",
      "The headquarters of the InterActiveCorp, known as the IAC Building, took the shape of a shimmering beehive when it was completed in New York City's Chelsea neighborhood in 2007. The 76-story New York by Gehry building, once one of the world's tallest residential structures, was a stunning addition to the lower Manhattan skyline when it opened in 2011.",
      "That same year, Gehry joined the faculty of his alma mater, the University of Southern California, as a professor of architecture. He also taught at Yale and Columbia University.",
      "Not everyone was a fan of Gehry's work. Some naysayers dismissed it as not much more than gigantic, lopsided reincarnations of the little scrap-wood cities he said he spent hours building when he was growing up in the mining town of Timmins, Ontario.",
      "Princeton art critic Hal Foster dismissed many of his later efforts as \"oppressive,\" arguing they were designed primarily to be tourist attractions. Some denounced the Disney Hall as looking like a collection of cardboard boxes that had been left out in the rain.",
      "Still other critics included Dwight D. Eisenhower's family, who objected to Gehry's bold proposal for a memorial to honor the nation's 34th president. Although the family said it wanted a simple memorial and not the one Gehry had proposed, with its multiple statues and billowing metal tapestries depicting Eisenhower's life, the architect declined to change his design significantly.",
      "If the words of his critics annoyed Gehry, he rarely let on. Indeed, he even sometimes played along. He appeared as himself in a 2005 episode of \"The Simpsons,\" in which he agreed to design a concert hall that was later converted into a prison.",
      "He came up with the idea for the design, which looked a lot like the Disney Hall, after crumpling Marge Simpson's letter to him and throwing it on the ground. After taking a look at it, he declared, \"Frank Gehry, you've done it again!\"",
      "\"Some people think I actually do that,\" he would later tell The AP.",
      "Ephraim Owen Goldberg was born in Toronto on Feb. 28, 1929, and moved to Los Angeles with his family in 1947, eventually becoming a U.S. citizen. As an adult, he changed his name at the suggestion of his first wife, who told him antisemitism might be holding back his career.",
      "Although he had enjoyed drawing and building model cities as a child, Gehry said it wasn't until he was 20 that he pondered the possibility of pursuing a career in architecture, after a college ceramics teacher recognized his talent.",
      "\"It was like the first thing in my life that I'd done well in,\" he said.",
      "He went on to earn a degree in architecture from the University of Southern California in 1954. After serving in the Army, he studied urban planning at Harvard University.",
      "His survivors include his wife, Berta; daughter, Brina; sons Alejandro and Samuel; and the buildings he created.",

      "Father Kavanagh",
      "Pen in hand and his notebook open before him, he was ready to do what he did every November: Get started on his Christmas list.",
      "He had vacated the French desk in the study and adopted the kitchen island as a command center. At the east end of the island, he wrote letters, paid bills, stashed his laptop, and kept a handy trove of books. The west end was reserved for culinary pursuits.",
      "When Cynthia cooked, he often read aloud to her from Mary Oliver, Billy Collins, Wendell Berry, or, out of long affection, George Herbert and Wordsworth. Early on, they agreed that poetry paired well with food prep, fiction worked best after dinner, and nonfiction was for reading alone, silent as a monk.",
      "By seven-thirty a.m., he had prayed with his wife, checked his sugar, had his shot, and polished off his stone-ground oatmeal with raw honey and multigrain toast. This upbeat start on the morning had made him over-confident \u2013 his pen was poised but nothing was happening. The grand expectation of churning through the list was morphing into a muse.",
      "He considered the books spilling out of their allotted space and encroaching on the laptop. Back in the day, which seemed a cool hundred years ago, he'd been a bachelor priest in his slip-covered wingchair, avidly reading through a pile of books. Books were his friends, his family, his mode of travel, his relief from the woes of the vestry.",
      "Somehow, and certainly not by his own effort, he'd gone from a bachelor with blood kin consisting of one lone cousin, Walter, to a family his cousin called 'humongous.' While such a family delivered equally humongous dividends of pleasure, his reading time had taken a hit.",
      "Before Cynthia, he'd been unmoored by the prospect of sharing his time with a wife. How much of his time could a wife possibly need? Now he knew and he did not regret even a minute with his cheerful, artistic, and beautiful wife. He was unmoored no more; but settled in. In a groove, you might say, though definitely not in a rut.",
      "And there was Dooley \u2013 not of his blood, but of his heart. At the age of eleven, Dooley had landed on his doorstep, a thrown-away boy \u2013 barefoot in shredded overalls, with a mouth that a mother of yore would have washed out with soap. Call it a miracle that today his adopted son \u2013 now a successful veterinarian with his own practice \u2013 had a beautiful, artistic wife himself. And two kids that Cynthia and he were over the moon about.",
      "A phenomenal string of events had cast him in roles he'd never dreamed of fulfilling \u2013 father, husband, father-in-law, brother, brother-in-law, great-uncle, grandfather.",
      "There was Jack, a lovable seven-year-old mash-up of cowboy boots and imagination, and Sadie, a going-on-three-year-old who had taken down every defense in her grandpa's arsenal. He'd never given his heart so freely.",
      "With Cynthia, he'd fought giving his heart. There was the inarguable fact that he'd already given it to God \u2013 though only to a certain degree, as he later realized. That had seen him through a decades-long passage until he had a revelation: God's love for his children wasn't just for them to have and to hold, it was to freely, spontaneously give away \u2013 and to gratefully receive from others. Why hadn't he understood this before?",
      "That awakening had opened both his heart and his intellect to a sober realization \u2013 while he'd spent years being afraid to love, he'd been far more terrified of receiving it. He had begun at once to work these truths into daily practice. Not easy. And not overnight. But the process had performed its share of miracles \u2013 had, in fact, at the tender age of sixty-two, gotten him married.",
      "His abandoned French desk, given to him recently by a former parishioner, now displayed an archive of framed family photos. There was Dooley and Lace's Sadie, miraculously born to a mother long pronounced unable to conceive.",
      "A few years ago, he learned he had a half-brother. Out of time and despair, hope and prayer, Henry \u2013 a brother. They both resolved to drop the 'half' business. He and Cynthia had attended Henry's Holly Springs wedding \u2013 an event that gave him a witty and agreeable sister-in-law. He studied the wedding photograph, searching Henry's face for any resemblance to his own. Zero. But they both loved poetry and starched handkerchiefs and letters written in cursive. He had a laugh at the memory of taking Henry by the shoulders, looking him in the eye, and saying, 'Brother, I forgive you for being taller and better-looking.'",
      "To go from a family consisting of a cousin to the present-day slew was a sea change, calling for a new way of dealing with Christmas giving. In years past, he had made a list. Now he must make A List.",
      "Cynthia breezed into the kitchen in a vague cloud of her signature wisteria scent.",
      "'You wear perfume for the grans?'",
      "'Jack says he loves the way his Granny smells \u2013 it makes him sneeze. He also loves making his own picture book. You'll see it soon; it's about bugs. When he turns all that talent loose in the world ... wow! How about your Poetry with Grandpa syllabus?'",
      "'I need one more run through the town library. Poetry for three-year-olds is scarce.' As Lace's mural-painting commissions increased, she needed help with the kids. He and Cynthia were giving a hand when Lily Flower was otherwise employed.",
      "His wife was applying lipstick without the aid of a mirror. It was his job to give a thumbs-up if she hit the mark. She hit the mark while eyeing the kitchen island.",
      "'Could you clean some of the stuff off the counter?' she said. 'It runneth over.'",
      "'I was just thinking that.'",
      "'I'm making pasta for the weekend and ... ' She gestured. ' . . . all those Billy Collins books.'",
      "'But you love Billy Collins.'",
      "'I'm crazy about Billy Collins, but not when I'm making pasta, which takes up gobs of room.'",
      "'Consider it done.'",
      "She gave him a smooch on the cheek. 'Love you, sweetheart.'",
      "'Love you back.'",
      "'Are you off to the hospital?'",
      "'Tomorrow,' he said.",
      "'See you at five, then. Could you pick up a lemon for tonight?'",
      "'Will do. Anything else, give me a shout. Love to the kids. Tell them I'll be out soon.'",
      "'Ooops, I got lipstick on your cheek.'",
      "'Leave it. I'm branded.'",
      "And away she flew, eager for what life had to offer.",
      "He had always started his Christmas list with the nurses. Who could make it without nurses? Not the doctors, not the patients. How many years had he spent plowing up the hill to visit the ever-changing stable of patients, assisted by nurses in his labors of consolation? Even the sour ones had their place in the scheme of things.",
      "And didn't nurses love chocolate? Wasn't that their favorite thing to go home to even if they had a husband who was good-looking and would carry out the garbage? But the rules had shifted when he wasn't looking. He'd been told that what nurses want now is gift certificates. Nurses want to choose their chocolate themselves.",
      "Good for nurses for speaking out and taking charge!",
      "Five gift certificates for chocolate. It felt good just getting that on paper. Unlike his free-ranging wife, he enjoyed the boundaries imposed by a list.",
      "He would save his wife 'til last on the list because she required more than a bit of head-scratching. 'Don't buy me anything,' she said just yesterday. 'I have everything I could possibly want or need. Just write me a love letter. Please, honey.'",
      "He loved it when she called him honey.",
      "He remembered the Year of the Bathrobe \u2013 he had searched for one-hundred-percent cotton with pockets \u2013 she favored pockets \u2013 and matching slippers. Though he was convinced he had a home run, she had seemed ... what? Dismayed wouldn't cover it.",
      "A more recent Christmas gift had its own downside. According to rule, they agreed to give each other one gift only \u2013 no cheating by giving more. It had to be utilitarian, and they had to keep mum so it would be a surprise. She liked surprises.",
      "They had ended up giving each other the same thing \u2013 a smoothie blender. The same make and model. Surprise all around! Hers, however, had been on sale and she had saved thirty bucks. Which meant that he'd be returning the one he bought. All he had to do was hike to the recycle bin in a freezing rain and retrieve the box and dig through the foam peanuts that went berserk all over the place and locate the shipping label and the form that asked why the item was being returned, to which he replied It's a long story, and then rewrap the blasted thing and schlep it to the UPS drop-off.",
      "Looking back, his own biggest want had once been for a world globe, and she had been thrilled to give him one. Years later \u2013 six or seven, maybe \u2013 he was still perfectly satisfied with his globe. Lighted. In a mahogany stand. How could he want more?",
      "'I'd love to give you something you'd really, deeply enjoy,' she said yesterday. 'Something that would make you feel, I don't know, seventeen again?'",
      "'I have her,' he said.",
      "She seemed to like that argument, but still ...",
      "Since they married, he'd written a love letter or two. The one in which he plagiarized a passage from Duff Cooper had been a hit. Cooper had enjoyed a career of writing torrid love letters to his wife, Diana, before dying at sea in '54. But the letter currently under consideration would have to come entirely from his own striving.",
      "Gus was awake and panting at his feet.",
      "The red leash that his hundred-and-ten-pound Bouvier had worn was of course too large for a rescue of thirty-three pounds soaking wet. He had punched a few holes and used his leather cutter to nip the excess.",
      "Out they went into the mountain fog.",
      "So far, November was an unseasonably warm month, not cold enough for a fire in the hearth. This weekend would be different; the temperature was predicted to drop by several degrees, and they had a half-cord of hardwood he was itching to burn.",
      "This was ground fog; those headed down the mountain would be driving the first few miles in a cloud. He was a fog fan. And no wonder \u2013 he was Irish. Gus also had a touch of the Irish. His dog was fond of music, had once lapped up a spilled Guinness at a Meadowgate party, and was inclined to good humor often resulting in a grin.",
      "He had believed grinning dogs merely a staple of YouTube, but now he had one of his own \u2013 who, by the way, could also bark with a ball in his mouth. He absolutely did not deserve such a talented dog.",
      "He spied Emma Newland barreling around the corner with Snickers, a twelve-year-old rescue. At this distance, he could not run nor could he hide from his former church secretary and personal Genghis Kahn. He zipped his jacket, turned up the collar, armored himself. He could tell by Gus's bark that his dog was not into this encounter; Gus had met Snickers on other occasions and was unimpressed.",
      "'Why don't you get another leash?' she yelled over the barking.",
      "'This leash is fine,' he yelled back.",
      "'Seems like it would remind you of you know who.'",
      "She had seldom called his former companion by name.",
      "'I like being reminded of Barnabas!' he shouted into the din.",
      "Snickers retreated behind his owner, growling, as Gus took leeway to sniff Emma's shoes. Black. Sturdy. Size ten. Triple A. She was proud of the triple A. As her former priest and so-called boss, he knew almost everything about this woman whose desk had sat less than three feet from his own. He had to hand it to her \u2013 Emma Newland could, in a heartbeat, make three feet feel like three inches.",
      "She gave him the eye, as if she'd caught him being naughty in some inconceivable way. 'What brings you out so early?'",
      "'Gus!' he said.",
      "Up ahead, the first squirrel of the morning. And away they went at a trot.",
      "He and Gus were blowing across the parking lot at Mitford School when he met Grace Murphy, speed-walking toward the school's front entrance. Blond hair in braids, bifocals firmly in place, a wide-open smile displaying a hatchwork of braces on wayward teeth. Grace was one of his favorite people.",
      "'Good morning, Father! And good morning, Gusarino.' She stooped, girded by a backpack of considerable size, to give his happy dog a head scratch.",
      "'We're glad to see you out brightening up the world,' he said.",
      "'I'm reading to our English class this morning. I'm sort of nervous!'",
      "'What are you reading?'",
      "'Willa Cather On Writing.'",
      "'Willa Cather? Remind me what grade you're in?'",
      "'Fifth because I skipped third,' she said. 'Next week, we'll be reading from Eudora Welty's book on writing. I'm co-teaching a whole American Literature unit with Miss Phillips. Got to go, Father! Bye, Gussie! Have a great day!'",
      "'The Lord be with you!' he called after her.",
      "'And also with you!' she called back. Grace was an acolyte at Lord's Chapel, wise in the ways of liturgical response.",
      "He felt the smile on his face, the way it softened his skin that was busy drinking clean mountain air.",
      "Two squirrels later, he was back in the kitchen, staring at The List.",
      "He was a dash fatigued from their walk. Supplying St. Mark's in Holding had been a mixed blessing. Full priestly duties June through October, combined with driving up and down the mountain, had been a stretch. In the five months of priesting a troubled parish, he had counted heavily on the prayer that never fails.",
      "Back to business.",
      "His mother had been the Christmas-list maker of all time \u2013 everything inscribed in a stenographer's notebook by July seventh, when she closed her gardens to the public. She set at once to the task of making pin cushions, pillowcases, embroidered dresser scarves, the occasional sweater or baby blanket, and stacks of tea towels and aprons from printed flour sacks.",
      "'Th' woman is an industry,' said his grandfather.",
      "She also used flour sacks to make his boxers for her mortified son. He could depend on the sight of them under the tree \u2013 a starched four-pack wrapped in white tissue and adorned with a holly sprig.",
      "He remembered hiding like a common thief when exchanging his britches for running shorts in the school locker room. He had nonetheless been spied in this covert maneuver, and the shamings were a memory he detested. He was fourteen when he finally wrangled store-bought from his mother, the family exchequer.",

    "published": "Wed, 03 Dec 2025 20:01:31 -0500",
    "summary": "Steve Cropper co-wrote several classics, including \"(Sittin' on) the Dock of the Bay,\" \"Green Onions\" and \"In the Midnight Hour.\"",
    "story": [
      "Steve Cropper, the lean, soulful guitarist and songwriter who helped anchor the celebrated Memphis backing band Booker T. and the M.G.'s at Stax Records and co-wrote the classics \"Green Onions,\" \"(Sittin' on) the Dock of the Bay\" and \"In the Midnight Hour,\" has died. He was 84.",
      "Pat Mitchell Worley, president and CEO of the Soulsville Foundation, confirmed Cropper's death to CBS News. The foundation operates the Stax Museum of American Soul Music in Memphis, located at the site of the former Stax Records, where Cropper worked for years.",
      "A cause of death was not immediately known. Longtime associate Eddie Gore told The Associated Press he was with Cropper on Tuesday at a rehabilitation facility in Nashville, where Cropper had been after a recent fall. Cropper had been working on new music when Gore visited, he said.",
      "\"He's such a good human,\" Gore said. \"We were blessed to have him, for sure.\"",
      "\"Steve was a beloved musician, songwriter, and producer whose extraordinary talent touched the lives of millions worldwide,\" Cropper's family said in a statement released through the foundation, describing his \"influence on American music is immeasurable.\"",
      "\"Every note he played, every song he wrote, and every artist he inspired ensure that his spirit and artistry will continue to move people for generations to come,\" the family wrote.",
      "The guitarist, songwriter and record producer was not known for flashy playing, but his spare, catchy licks and solid rhythm chops helped define Memphis soul music. At a time when it was common for White musicians to co-opt the work of Black artists and make more money from their songs, Cropper was that rare White artist willing to keep a lower profile and collaborate.",
      "Cropper was celebrated, respected by fellow guitarists",
      "Cropper's very name was immortalized in the 1967 smash \"Soul Man,\" recorded by Sam & Dave. Midway, singer Sam Moore calls out \"Play it, Steve!\" as Cropper pulls off a tight, ringing riff, a slide sound that Cropper used a Zippo lighter to create. The exchange was reenacted in the late 1970s when Cropper joined the John Belushi-Dan Aykroyd act \"The Blues Brothers\" and played on their hit cover of \"Soul Man.\"",
      "In a 2020 interview with AP, Cropper discussed his career and how he mastered the art of filling gaps with an essential lick or two.",
      "\"I listen to the other musicians and the singer,\" Cropper said. \"I'm not listening to just me. I make sure I'm sounding OK before we start the session. Once we've presented the song, then I listen to the song and the way they interpret it. And I play around all that stuff. That's what I do. That's my style.\"",
      "Rolling Stones guitarist Keith Richards, asked once about Cropper, said simply, \"Perfect, man.\" On a YouTube instructional video, guitar virtuoso Joe Bonamassa says Cropper's moves are often copied.",
      "\"If you haven't heard the name Steve Cropper, you've heard him in song,\" Bonamassa said.",
      "Cropper was born near Dora, Missouri, but moved with his family to Memphis when he was 9 and got his first mail-order guitar at age 14, according to his website, playitsteve.com. Chuck Berry, Jimmy Reed and Chet Atkins were among his early influences.",
      "Cropper was a Stax artist before the label was even called Stax, which Jim Stewart and Estelle Axton had founded as Satellite Records in 1957. In the early 1960s, Satellite signed up Cropper and his instrumental band the Royals Spades. The band soon changed its name to the Mar-Keys and had a hit with \"Last Night.\"",
      "Satellite was later renamed Stax, where some of the Mar-Keys became the label's horn section while Cropper and other Mar-Keys formed Booker T. and the M.G.'s. Featuring Cropper, keyboard player Booker T. Jones, bassist Donald \"Duck\" Dunn and drummer Al Jackson, they were known for their hit instrumentals \"Green Onions,\" \"Hang 'Em High\" and \"Time Is Tight,\" and backed Otis Redding, Sam & Dave and others.",
      "Cropper co-wrote \"(Sittin' On) The Dock of the Bay\" weeks before Redding's death",
      "In a 2017 interview with \"CBS Mornings,\"\u00a0Cropper recounted playing guitar behind Redding at the Monterey Pop Festival in a legendary 1967 performance that helped put Redding on the map.",
      "\"We had no idea what the reaction was gonna be. And it was unbelievable,\" Cropper told \"CBS Mornings.\"",
      "In late November of 1967, Cropper said Redding brought him a song the now-legendary singer had started writing on a houseboat overlooking San Francisco Bay that would become \"(Sittin' On) The Dock of the Bay.\"",
      "\"That afternoon, it was done,\" Cropper told \"CBS Mornings.\" \"We went and cut it the next day. I think there's three takes of it.\"",

      "\"And I said, 'I just lost my best friend,'\" Cropper told \"CBS Mornings.\"",
      "Cropper returned to the studio to put the finishing touches on the song, and \"(Sittin' On) The Dock of the Bay,\" released in January 1968, became the first posthumous No. 1 record on the Billboard charts. It won Redding and Cropper the Grammy for Best R&B song, with Redding also winning Best Male R&B Vocal Performance.",
      "Booker T. and the M.G.'s. broke barriers",
      "Booker T. and the M.G.'s. was a racially integrated band, a rarity in its day. It was so admired that even non-Stax artists recorded with them, notably Wilson Pickett. Jones, who is the only surviving member of the band, and Jackson are Black. Dunn and Cropper are white.",
      "\"When you walked in the door at Stax, there was absolutely no color,\" Cropper said in the AP interview. \"We were all there for the same reason \u2014 to get a hit record.\"",
      "In the mid-1960s, Atlantic Records executive Jerry Wexler brought Pickett to work with the Stax musicians. During a 2015 gathering with the National Music Publishers Association, Cropper acknowledged he had never heard of Pickett before working with him. He found some gospel recordings by Pickett, was taken by the line \"I'll see my Jesus in the midnight hour\" and with a slight change helped write a secular standard.",
      "\"The man up there has been forgiving me for this ever since!\" he said.",
      "Cropper was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1992 as a member of Booker T. and the M.G.'s. That year, Cropper, Dunn and Jones played in an all-star tribute at Madison Square Garden to Bob Dylan. Al Jackson died in 1975, Dunn in 2012.",
      "Rolling Stone magazine ranked Cropper 39th on its 100 Greatest Guitarists list, calling him \"the secret ingredient in some of the greatest rock and soul songs.\"",
      "Cropper was in the 1980 movie \"The Blues Brothers\" and its follow-up, \"Blues Brothers 2000,\" portraying \"The Colonel\" in the Blues Brothers band. In real life, he toured with them.",
      "He was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2005, and two years later received a Grammy Award for lifetime achievement.",
      "Cropper continued recording into his later years, including 2024's \"Friendlytown,\" which was nominated for a Grammy. Earlier this year, Cropper received the Tennessee Governor's Arts Award, the state's highest honor in the arts.",

      "As of Friday, there were 21 poisonings confirmed by the California Poison Control System linked to eating wild, foraged mushrooms, such as death caps, the CDPH said.",
      "One case resulted in death, and several other patients, including children and adults, have suffered severe liver damage, the CDPH said. A liver transplant may even be needed for at least one of the patients.",
      "The CDPH said the poisonings were reported in clusters in the Monterey area and Bay Area. However, the risk of poisoning is statewide as rain during the fall and winter months creates beneficial growth conditions for death caps.",
      "They can typically be found near oaks and other hardwood trees, including pine trees, and are easily mistaken for safe, edible mushrooms. But neither cooking, boiling, drying or freezing them will render them safe to eat, the CDPH said.",
      "Symptoms such as watery diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain and dehydration can begin between six to 24 hours after eating one, and it's possible symptoms will go away after a day, but the CDPH warns the recovery is \"deceptive.\"",
      "\"Patients may still develop serious to fatal liver damage within 48 to 96 hours after eating the mushrooms,\" the CDPH said.",
      "\"Because the death cap can easily be mistaken for edible safe mushrooms, we advise the public not to forage for wild mushrooms at all during this high-risk season,\" said Dr. Erica Pan, CDPH Director and State Public Health Officer.",

    "published": "Wed, 03 Dec 2025 13:39:12 -0500",
    "summary": "Kian Sadeghi, the 25-year-old founder and CEO at Nucleus Genomics, tells \"CBS Mornings\" that parents have every right to select the qualities and traits they desire in their child.",
    "story": [
      "Big leaps in science have made a once-impossible, much-debated question come to life: Would you design your unborn child?",
      "Kian Sadeghi, the 25-year-old founder and CEO at Nucleus Genomics, believes every parent has a right to do just that, selecting qualities they desire \u2013 from height to weight to intelligence. He calls it \"genetic optimization,\" and it's part of a Silicon Valley push to breed \"super-babies.\"",
      "Sadeghi dropped out of the University of Pennsylvania and started the company in 2021, inspired by a cousin who died of a rare genetic illness. Backed by investors and prominent tech entrepreneurs like Peter Thiel and Alexis Ohanian, Sadeghi says his company has already helped thousands of families.",
      "\"It's the parents' right to know\"",
      "\"We give you the full range of insights there is to know about your future child. We really think it's the parents' right to know,\" he told \"CBS Mornings\" in an interview that aired Wednesday.",
      "Genetic testing companies like Nucleus say DNA screening of embryos can prevent disease, while also giving parents a unique ability to compare and choose traits that make up a healthier baby \u2013 and one that's more desirable in the eyes of mom and dad.",
      "\"They want us to, you know, play sports and they want us to go to the best school. They want us to be well educated. They want us to thrive. Life, I think, as a parent doesn't just stop at 'I want my child to be healthy,'\" Sadeghi said.",
      "For $30,000, Nucleus offers a program called IVF+, which includes full DNA scans of both parents and up to 20 embryos conceived through in vitro fertilization. The results come back in the form of a sleek, user-friendly menu.",
      "Advanced DNA screenings",
      "The company screens embryo samples for more than 2,000 traits and conditions, including eye color, hair color, intelligence \u2013 even acne. It also can estimate genetic predisposition to medical conditions such as depression, autism and bipolar disorder.",
      "Sadeghi says this \"genetic optimization\" allows parents to minimize disease while maximizing traits they prefer. However, critics have drawn comparisons to a different term: \"eugenics.\"",
      "\"[It's not eugenics] by any stretch, because it's fundamentally about empowering people with information that they can use to give their child the best start in life,\" he said. \"And yes, if you want 2 inches taller for your child, 3 inches taller, right, if you want a couple IQ-point difference, absolutely, by all means, do that. But I'm saying, you're really asking me here, you're asking me, what is life about? That's what you're really getting at when you talk about height and IQ, right, they're abstractions of life.\"",
      "Ethical debate over reproductive genetics",
      "But while companies like Nucleus continue to grow, some medical experts point to the ethical dilemmas surrounding these types of new reproductive technologies. An article published in the MIT Technology Review in October argued the race to create the \"perfect baby\" is actually creating an \"ethical mess.\"",
      "In a\u00a0statement last year, the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics said the practice of genetic screenings and use of polygenic risk scores for embryo selection has \"moved too fast with too little evidence.\"",
      "\"In this statement we do not address either individual or broader social, ethical, and regulatory issues this testing raises,\" the group noted.",
      "But Sadeghi said he remains confident in the data.",
      "\"Our predictors can better predict longevity from an embryo's DNA than any other genetic model ever built,\" he said.",
      "However, he pushes back on the criticism that he's creating a new class of \"superhumans.\"",
      "\"DNA is not destiny, the messiness of life, the nurture element of life, right, how hard your child works, you know, what school they go to, what resources they have, serendipity, all those factors are never, ever going to go away,\" Sadeghi said.",

    "published": "Fri, 05 Dec 2025 19:55:34 -0500",
    "summary": "Netflix on Friday said it will acquire Warner Bros., including its film and television studios, HBO Max and HBO.",
    "story": [
      "Netflix on Friday said it is buying Warner Bros. in a deal valued at $82.7 billion, merging the biggest streaming service with a storied studio that has produced films such as \"Casablanca\" and the \"Harry Potter\" franchise.",
      "In a statement, Netflix said the deal is expected to close after Warner Bros. Discovery spins off its television networks division, Discovery Global, which is now expected to be completed in the third quarter of 2026.",
      "Netflix said it will buy Warner Bros. for $27.75 per share, giving the deal an equity value of $72 billion and a total enterprise value of $82.7 billion. The transaction is expected to close in 12 to 18 months, Netflix said.",
      "The agreement comes after Warner Bros. Discovery, the parent of Warner, had announced in June that it planned to split in two, dividing its cable networks such as CNN and TNT Sports from its streaming and studios business, including HBO Max and Warner Bros. Television.",
      "But in October, Warner Bros. Discovery said it had attracted interest from companies about buying all or parts of it outright, with the Wall Street Journal reporting that media and entertainment businesses, including Paramount Skydance (the parent company of CBS News) and Comcast Corp., were also pursuing a deal for Warner Bros.",
      "According to media reports, Paramount Skydance was interested in acquiring all of Warner Bros., including its cable assets such as CNN and Discovery.",
      "Why Netflix wants Warner Bros.",
      "Buying Warner Bros.' studios would mark a major strategic shift for Netflix, experts said. Although Netflix already produces original programming, including hit shows such as \"Stranger Things,\" the acquisition would boost its ability to create content, while also giving it control of Warner Bros.' 102-year-old catalogue, analysts noted.",
      "Netflix \"will cement itself as the Goliath of streaming,\" said Mike Proulx, a vice president of research at Forrester. \"This deal changes the calculus of the streaming wars, representing a seismic shift in the entertainment industry.\"",
      "The enlarged company's greater scale could also help Netflix in negotiating with advertisers and partners, market research firm MKI Global said in a report. Adding Warner Bros.' studio and streaming business would give Netflix \"a larger flow of premium films and series, reduces hit-rate risk and gives the combined group firmer control over how each title earns through its cycle,\" the market research firm added.",
      "The deal also comes as Netflix competes with streaming rival YouTube, which is growing at a faster pace, according to Lightshed Partners analyst Rich Greenfield.",
      "\"Ultimately, investors need to assess whether Netflix is making this deal in a 'rare opportunity' to accelerate its growth or if it is truly more of a defensive move to limit its peers from getting stronger and increasing competition,\" analysts with MoffettNathanson Research, an investment advisory firm focused on tech, telecom and media, said in a research note.",
      "A streaming app to rule them all?",
      "In a conference call with investors to discuss the acquisition, Netflix executives said the deal will help the company attract more subscribers, while also creating value for shareholders.",
      "\"We expect to attract and maintain more subscribers, and drive incremental revenue and operating income,\" co-CEO Greg Peters said on the call.\u00a0 \"We think it'll accelerate our business for decades to come.\"",
      "Peters was also questioned about his comments at an October conference, when he said that big media mergers \"don't have an amazing track record.\" On Friday, the executive said he believed this merger would prove to be different because of Netflix's expertise in creating content.",
      "\"A lot of those failures [are] because the company doing the acquisition didn't understand the entertainment business,\" he said. \"We understand the business.\"",
      "Analysts said Netflix would benefit by adding Warner Bros.' extensive streaming and film content.",
      "\"The rationale for such a deal stems from merging two overlapping streaming offers into a single flagship Netflix app or a tight Netflix-HBO Max bundle, with one login, one discovery layer and one advertising system,\" MKI said.",
      "Potential regulatory hurdles",
      "Under the proposed deal, Netflix pledged to honor any contractual agreements for releasing Warner Bros.' studio films. Yet the streaming giant could face regulatory hurdles in seeking to complete the deal amid concerns the transaction could weaken competition among theaters, Wall Street analysts said.",
      "\"Significant concerns have been voiced over the potential impact to the theatrical market should Netflix take over [Warner Bros.],\" analysts with Wedbush Securities said in a note to investors, adding that \"concerns remain within the industry and among government officials\" about the impact of such a deal.",
      "Some lawmakers on Friday also raised concerns that Netflix's dominance in streaming could lead to higher prices for consumers.",
      "\"Allowing Netflix to buy Warner Bros. and control access to almost half of streaming subscribers means it could get more expensive to watch your favorite movies and shows,\" Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat from Massachusetts, said on social media.",
      "Shares of Warner Bros., whose stock price has more than doubled since this summer as speculation of a possible deal heated up, gained $1.54, or 6.3%, to close the day at $26.08. Netflix shares fell $2.98, or 2.9%, to $100.24.",

All 50 U.S. states have laws requiring vehicles to halt for a stopped school bus with flashing red lights and a deployed stop-arm signal,\u00a0according to the NHTSA.",
      "Waymo said it identified the software issue that contributed to the school bus incidents and that it implemented updates by Nov. 17, which it said improved its vehicles' performance. The company is also planning to issue a voluntary software recall with NHTSA next week, Mauricio Pe\u00f1a, chief safety officer at Waymo, told CBS News late Friday.",
      "\"We will continue analyzing our vehicles' performance and making necessary fixes as part of our commitment to continuous improvement,\" said Pe\u00f1a.",

      "\"As of Dec. 1, 2025, Waymo received its 20th citation since the beginning of the school year,\" JJ Maldonado, a communications specialist for the Austin Independent School District, told CBS News. \"This is after the company said it had fixed the issue through software updates that were implemented on Nov. 17.\"",
      "In a Nov. 20\u00a0letter\u00a0to Waymo, the school district called on the robotaxi company to cease operations within the school district during the hours when students are loading and unloading from school buses until software updates are completed and Waymo can guarantee its vehicles will comply with the law.",
      "Maldonado said the company \"refused to cease operations\" during the hours the school district had requested.",
      "In response to a request for comment about the NHTSA probe, Waymo pointed to its overall safety record.",
      "\"Safety is our top priority, and the data shows we are improving road safety in the communities in which we operate, achieving a fivefold reduction in injury-related crashes compared to human drivers, and twelve times fewer injury crashes involving pedestrians,\" a Waymo spokesperson told CBS News in an email.",
      "Waymo did not comment on its response to the Austin school district's request to suspend service when students are getting on and off buses.",
      "In October, NHTSA launched a probe into the company after an incident in Atlanta, Georgia, in which a Waymo vehicle drove around a stopped school bus with flashing red lights and its stop arm deployed.",
      "While maneuvering around the bus, NHTSA said the vehicle passed the bus' stop arm and a safety device that swings out from the bus close to where students were disembarking. At the time of the incident, no safety operator was present in the self-driving vehicle, according to the NHTSA.",

      "Gorick Ng, a Harvard career adviser and University of California, Berkeley, faculty member, said the stakes for Gen Z are high. If they can't get the right experience early on, they could struggle to catch up professionally and financially.",
      "\"If the pool of entry-level opportunities continues to dry up, then it's going to be ever more challenging for this generation to show certain brand names, certain job titles and certain bullet points on their resumes, which is only going to make that next job more challenging to get,\" he said.",
      "Slowdown in hiring",
      "Getting your foot in the door has always been tougher for young workers, and current labor market conditions aren't making it any easier. The overall hiring rate, which has been declining since 2022, has fallen to just over 3%, below its historical average, according to Oxford Economics.",
      "Hiring is muted due to uncertainty about the U.S. economy, including the government policy environment and tariffs, Gould told CBS News. \"There's this sort of sitting tight for employers and for workers right now, not wanting to make any sudden moves because of the uncertainty,\" she said.",
      "The nation's overall unemployment rate in September was 4.4% \u2014 less than half the 9.2% rate for 20- to 24-year-olds, according to government labor figures.",
      "Even when early-career employees succeed in landing a coveted position, they may face barriers climbing the ladder. That's because, with more seasoned employees often staying put these days because of economic uncertainty and as employment turnover slows, Gen Zers have fewer opportunities to switch jobs \u2014 a common route to gaining more responsibilities and higher pay.",
      "\"Your salary is all about growing or negotiating leverage,\" Ng said. \"And so when you look for another position, one of the easiest ways to ask for more money is to have made more money in the past.\"",
      "Alan Gonzalez, a 23-year-old resident of Malden, Mass., said he'd be willing to take a lower-paying job in his field just to kick-start his career. Since graduating from UMass Boston in May, he has been working as a restaurant server while looking for a position in digital marketing.",
      "\"Despite having a lot of internship experience and real-world practical experience that I can apply, including my degree, it has still been very difficult to even get an interview opportunity,\" he told CBS News.",
      "Eager to exercise his creativity but without any job offers in hand, Gonzalez has also started his own clothing brand, HOJA Apparel, which he describes as a \"lifestyle streetwear meets streetwear hybrid\" focused on high-quality and design. He's working to grow his social media presence to promote the brand, with an official clothing drop planned for next year.",
      "\"Right now, the priority is experience,\" Gonzalez said.",
      "Some industries pose their own challenges when Gen Z job-hunters come knocking. For example, employers in fields such as accounting, engineering and technology typically have fewer job openings for junior employees than senior-level roles, according to data from career services firm Indeed.",
      "\"It has become progressively harder for almost anyone to secure jobs in those areas, and this is especially true for younger workers,\" Cory Stahle, senior economist in the Indeed Hiring Lab, said in an email. \"Fewer opportunities also mean that entry-level workers are becoming more likely to compete against an increasing number of mid- or senior-level workers in the process as well.\"",
      "As of October, an average of around 30% of software development jobs listed on Indeed were for positions with senior titles, versus around 2% for roles with junior titles. Similar discrepancies exist for data analysis and tech positions.",
      "Many of the challenges of finding work are not unique to members of Gen Z, of course. Technology has long made it easier for people to submit a job application. But the latest technologies are also upping the competitive ante, according to Ng.",
      "\"AI and tech tools have made it easier to apply for internships,\" he said. \"But whenever something gets easier, the bar only gets higher, and the job application is really no different.\"",
      "Ng advises job candidates to get back to basics. That means trying to build relationships with potential employers, starting their job search early and making a concerted effort to get in front of a company's decision-makers.",
      "Escobedo said he's now putting an emphasis on old-school networking to get employers' attention. \"I've told my peers, the whole thing that it takes a village to raise a child, now it takes a village to get a college student a full-time role.\"",

    "published": "Fri, 05 Dec 2025 16:56:46 -0500",
    "summary": "President Trump's claims of a historic multitrillion-dollar investment surge don't match federal data or the administration's own numbers.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump has made increasingly sweeping claims about new investments flowing into the United States, citing figures as high as $21 trillion since taking office.",
      "\"Twenty-one trillion dollars will be the amount invested in the United States \u2014\u00a0 or committed to invest \u2014 in one year,\" the president said in a November meeting with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.",
      "In an Oval Office event this Wednesday, President Trump said, \"In 10 months, we have $18 trillion being invested.\"",
      "But a CBS News review found no evidence that total commitments or new investments approach the scale the president has cited. While companies and foreign governments have announced large-scale projects since Mr. Trump's inauguration, the White House has not provided documentation showing total investments approaching $21 trillion \u2014 an amount roughly two-thirds of the annual GDP.",
      "The administration's own list of major investments \"made possible by President Trump's leadership\" totaled $9.6 trillion as of the latest update in November, but even that figure is exaggerated. It includes some investments announced under President Biden and trade goals that the U.S. is also partially responsible for.",
      "The White House did not directly respond to CBS News' questions about these inclusions or the discrepancies between the administration's total and the much higher figures the president has claimed in his remarks.",
      "\"President Trump's dealmaking has secured trillions in investments to make and hire in America, trillions in commercial opportunities for American companies, and trillions in new export opportunities,\" White House spokesman Kush Desai said in a statement.",
      "Federal data shows corporate investment levels are roughly in line with last year, with companies on track to invest over $5 trillion in 2025. The $20 trillion surge Mr. Trump has claimed does not appear in the available data.",
      "Here's a closer look at some of the investment claims.",
      "Trump claims credit for some corporate investments announced under Biden",
      "The White House list includes more than 100 corporate commitments totaling over $3 trillion. Yet some of the largest were originally unveiled years before Mr. Trump took office and were backed by federal funding under President Biden's administration.",
      "The administration lists a $200 billion investment by Micron Technology in semiconductor manufacturing and research. However, a company spokesman confirmed $120 billion of that was previously announced in 2022 and supported by $6 billion in funding from Biden's Chips and Science Act.",
      "Similarly, the White House attributes a $16 billion GlobalFoundries investment in U.S. chip production to Mr. Trump. However, only $3 billion is newly promised this year. A company spokesperson said the remaining $13 billion was originally announced under Biden and backed by tax credits from the Chips and Science Act.",
      "The Trump administration also claims credit for some major clean-energy manufacturing investments, even though its own policies have undercut projects in the sector, said Tom Taylor, a senior policy analyst at Atlas Public Policy, which tracks clean energy investment in the U.S.",
      "The administration cited Invenergy's $1.7 billion commitment to a clean-energy transmission project announced in May. In July, the U.S. Department of Energy canceled a $4.9 billion loan guarantee to Invenergy that had been issued under Biden. A spokesman for Invenergy said the company is continuing its transmission project with private financing, including the previously announced $1.7 billion investment.",
      "\"The administration has kind of been on a tear this year about canceling clean energy projects,\" Taylor said. His research shows the administration's funding cuts and policy shifts have halted over $20.8 billion in clean manufacturing investments this year.",
      "The White House list also contains apparent errors, including a $3 billion pledge by Kraft Heinz that appears twice. The administration has not responded to a CBS News request for clarification.",
      "Foreign trade goals and aspirational pledges inflate totals",
      "Foreign governments account for nearly $6 trillion on the White House's list, but several of the largest entries are trade targets \u2014 not investments in the U.S.",
      "For example, in a joint announcement, the U.S. and Qatar committed to \"generate an economic exchange worth at least $1.2 trillion,\" without specifying what portion Qatar would spend or when. The figure is also more than five times the gross domestic product of Qatar in 2024.",
      "Similarly, India and the U.S. agreed to \"more than double total bilateral trade to $500 billion by 2030\" \u2014 a trade target, not a singular investment commitment.",
      "Some foreign investment pledges touted by Mr. Trump also appear aspirational to some economists.",
      "Saudi Arabia promised to invest roughly $1 trillion in the U.S. during the crown prince's visit to the White House in November. But economists, including Maya Senussi at the Wall Street advisory firm Oxford Economics, have questioned\u202fwhether the oil-rich country could afford an investment that size with global energy prices declining.",
      "History also offers reason for skepticism: Mr. Trump touted in 2017 that Saudi Arabia had agreed to buy $400 billion in U.S. goods, but exports of American goods and services amounted to less than one-fourth of that total over his first term, according to analysis by the Arab Gulf States Institute in Washington.",
      "Current U.S. investment levels remain typical",
      "Federal data suggests that real investment spending \u2014 as opposed to announced commitments \u2014 remains roughly in line with last year's levels.",
      "Within the U.S., gross private domestic investment, the broadest measure of what U.S. companies are spending to expand their businesses, is projected to total about $5.4 trillion this year, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis, or BEA. That's up roughly $100 billion from the same point last year, but far below the multitrillion-dollar surge Mr. Trump has mentioned.",
      "\"Trump may be talking about commitments that have yet to happen. But on actual investment spending \u2014 so new equipment, buildings and machinery \u2014 2025 is similar to 2024,\" Nicholas Bloom, an economics professor at Stanford University, told CBS News in an email.",
      "Some research suggests that foreign corporations have sharply increased the number of spending pledges under Mr. Trump. They've promised to invest over $270 billion from January to October, more than double the volume announced under Biden in the same period, according to fDi intelligence, which is part of the Financial Times.",
      "But experts say announcements do not always translate into realized investment.",
      "New foreign direct investment \u2014 the actual amount that foreign companies put into U.S. subsidiaries and projects \u2014 also remains steady. Foreign companies made roughly $145 billion worth of new investment in the U.S. in the first half of the year, nearly identical to the $144 billion invested in the same time period last year, BEA data shows.",
      "Analysts at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, an independent think tank, estimate foreign investments will come in under $400 billion this year, well below record levels.",
      "\"He's got a lot more in terms of announcements and promises than any prior president. But how much does that really mean in terms of money coming in?\" said Gary Clyde Hufbauer, nonresident senior fellow at the Peterson Institute.",
      "This story has been updated with additional information from Invenergy.",

    "published": "Fri, 05 Dec 2025 15:17:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Minimum wages are set to rise in 22 U.S. states and 66 cities and counties next year, even as the federal baseline wage remains at $7.25.",
    "story": [
      "Some workers will receive pay boosts next year as higher minimum wage regulations take effect in 22 states and 66 cities and counties across the U.S., a change that could help low-income households grappling with an\u00a0affordability crisis.",
      "On Jan. 1, 2026, the minimum wage is set to rise in 19 states and 49 cities and counties, for a total of 68 jurisdictions, according to a report from the National Employment Law Project (NELP), an advocacy organization for workers.",
      "Later in the year, an additional four states and 22 cities will boost their baseline wages, providing more relief to the lowest-paid U.S. workers, according to the group's analysis.",
      "Under the Fair Labor Standards Act, the federal wage floor remains at $7.25 an hour, where it has been stuck since 2009. Given the rise in the cost of living in subsequent years, some states and municipalities have chosen to boost their own minimum wages through a combination of ballot measures, inflation adjustments and legislation.",
      "\"Policies increasing the minimum wage have been a lifeline for underpaid workers who have been the most impacted by a growing affordability crisis,\" the NELP report states.",
      "Here's where minimum wages will rise in 2026:",
      "Jan. 1 minimum wage increases",
      "Beginning Jan. 1, workers in 60 jurisdictions will earn a minimum wage of at least $15 an hour. In three states and 40 localities, the minimum wage for some or all employers will reach or exceed $17 an hour.",
      "For example, in New Jersey, the wage floor for long-term care workers will rise to $18.92 an hour. New York City, Long Island and Westchester will all increase their baseline pay to $17 an hour.",
      "In some cases, minimum wage changes will be based on the size of the employer. For instance, large employers in Hayward, California \u2014 a city near San Francisco \u2014 will be required to pay workers a minimum of $17.79 an hour, although the figure for small establishments is $16.90.",
      "In Novato, California, another city in the Bay Area, the wage floor will increase according to employer size. For very large employers, or those with more than 100 workers, the minimum wage will rise to $17.73 an hour. Large employers, or those with 26 to 99 employees, will see a baseline pay of $17.46. Small employers, or those with 25 or fewer workers, will have a minimum wage of $16.90.",
      "Cost-of-living adjustments, raises designed to help workers' pay keep up with inflation, are driving minimum wage increases in 13 states and 44 cities and counties across the U.S., according to the NELP report.",
      "\"In the face of federal inaction, these raises are indexed to inflation, so they match the cost of living,\" NELP researcher Tsedeye Gebreselassie told CBS News.",
      "She noted that several increases have been driven by worker-led organizing, kicked off by the Fight for $15, a national movement for better pay and working conditions, which began in 2012.",
      "Some localities continue to have a $7.25 minimum wage. Many of them are in southern U.S. states.",
      "\"The contrast between states and cities that are raising wages every year and those that are stuck at $7.25 is really jarring,\" Gebreselassie said. \"On the one hand, the lack of affordability is about things costing too much, but on the other hand, it means people are not earning enough money to buy things.\"",
      "She added, \"There is a lot of talk about the former, but we need to make sure we are not losing sight of the fact that workers' wages need to go up.\"",

    "published": "Fri, 05 Dec 2025 07:29:19 -0500",
    "summary": "As the White House tries to curb Moscow's energy income, Vladimir Putin enjoys a warm welcome in India, and promises an \"uninterrupted supply\" of Russian fuel.",
    "story": [
      "New Delhi \u2014\u00a0Russian President Vladimir Putin held talks with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday at an annual summit and agreed to diversify mutual economic ties, as the United States presses India to revise its decades-old partnership with Russia.",
      "The 23rd Russia-India Summit comes at a pivotal moment as the U.S. pushes for a Ukraine peace deal while seeking global cooperation. It will test New Delhi's efforts to balance relations with Moscow and Washington as the nearly four-year war in Ukraine grinds on.",
      "Putin was received by Modi at an airport in New Delhi on Thursday. The Indian leader gave Putin a bear hug and a tight handshake with the gusto of an old friend.",
      "After the talks, Putin and Modi announced that India and Russia have finalized an economic cooperation program until 2030, which will help diversify mutual businesses to boost annual trade to $100 billion by 2030. They also emphasized strong energy ties.",
      "Bilateral trade between the two countries stood at $68.7 billion in the last fiscal year ended March. The trade is heavily skewed in favor of Russia with deep deficits for India, which it is looking to bridge by pushing exports.",
      "\"To achieve this significant goal, a program for the development of Russian-Indian economic cooperation until 2030 has been agreed upon,\" Putin said. He said work is underway on an agreement for India to establish a free trade zone with the Eurasian Economic Union, a Moscow-dominated economic grouping of several ex-Soviet nations, adding that it could help increase trade.",
      "\"Russia is a reliable supplier of energy resources and everything necessary for the development of India's energy sector,\" Putin said. \"We are ready to continue ensuring the uninterrupted supply of fuel for the rapidly growing Indian economy.\"",
      "Before the summit talks, the Russian leader said the two countries \"have a very trusting relationship when it comes to military-technical cooperation.\"",
      "Modi, for his part, said after the talks that the two countries will work toward early conclusion of a free trade agreement with the Eurasian Economic Union. He also announced that India will soon start issuing free electronic visas for Russian tourists and groups visiting the country.",
      "The Indian leader said energy security has long anchored India-Russia ties, with civil nuclear cooperation spanning decades. He added that such cooperation will continue, alongside collaboration in clean energy, shipbuilding, fertilizers and labor mobility.",
      "While India has historically maintained deep ties with Russia, critics say Putin's visit could strain relations with the European Union and the United States and might jeopardize negotiations for major trade agreements with both that are seen as critical for India's exports.",
      "President Trump raised tariffs on Indian goods to 50% in August, citing New Delhi's discounted Russian oil. India has been the second biggest importer of Russian crude after China.",
      "India's \"strategic tightrope walk\" between Russia and the West",
      "The U.S. says purchases of Russian oil help finance Moscow's war machine. In October, the U.S. sanctioned two of Moscow's biggest oil producers to force countries like India to cut down on imports. Indian officials have said New Delhi has always abided by international sanctions and would do so in the case of Russia oil purchases as well.",
      "The sanctions announced in October targeting Russian oil giants Lukoil and Rosneft were the first direct actions against Russia by the U.S. Treasury since Mr. Trump took office for his second term. The Treasury said about a month later that they were having the desired impact, with nearly a dozen major Indian and Chinese purchasers of Russian oil coming forward to say they would pause purchases of Russian oil deliveries for December.",
      "India and the U.S. set a target for the first tranche of a trade deal by the fall, but the deal hasn't come through yet amid strains in relations. The Trump administration has for months tied the imposition of steep tariffs on Indian imports directly to the country's ongoing purchases of Russian energy.",

      "India is also in the final stages of talks on a trade agreement with the EU, which sees Russia's war in Ukraine as a major threat.",
      "Putin's India visit, \"given the timing and geopolitical context, underscores New Delhi's strategic tightrope walk between the West and the rest, chiefly Russia,\" said Praveen Donthi, a senior analyst with the International Crisis Group.",
      "Donthi said India's tilt toward Russia dates back to the Cold War and persists despite its official nonaligned position. \"The significant change now is its desire to be a strategic partner with the U.S. at the same time, which will be a diplomatic challenge,\" he added.",
      "Indian officials earlier said that Modi in the meeting with Putin would push for faster delivery of two further Russian S-400 surface-to-air missile systems. It has already received three under a 2018 deal worth about $5.4 billion. The delay has been tied to supply chain disruptions linked to the war in Ukraine.",
      "The two sides signed a pact in February to improve military cooperation, exercises, port calls, disaster relief assistance and logistics support. Moscow's State Duma ratified the same ahead of Putin's India visit.",
      "India is also expecting to upgrade its Russian-made Su-30MKI fighter jets and accelerate deliveries of critical military hardware.",
      "India is keen to increase exports of pharmaceuticals, agriculture and textiles to Russia and is seeking the removal of non-tariff barriers. New Delhi is also seeking long-term supplies of fertilizers from Moscow.",
      "Another key area where the two countries hope to finalize an agreement is the safety and regulation of migration of Indian skilled workers to Russia.",
      "Putin last visited India in 2021. Modi was in Moscow last year, and the two leaders briefly met in September in China during a Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit.",

    "published": "Thu, 04 Dec 2025 17:27:51 -0500",
    "summary": "Rents in the 50 largest cities have surged by hundreds of dollars per month over the last five years, a LendingTree analysis found.",
    "story": [
      "If buying a home today is\u00a0financially out of reach\u00a0for many Americans, affording the rent may also seem like an increasingly tall order.",
      "In the 50 largest U.S. cities, the rent for a one-bedroom apartment climbed an average of $457 per month, or 41%, to $1,578\u00a0between 2020 and 2025, according to a recent\u00a0study\u00a0from loan marketplace LendingTree. Two-bedroom rents have surged an average of $505, or 37%, to roughly $1,858 per month over the same period.",
      "Since 2019, rents nationally have risen\u00a01.5 times faster than wages on average, according to a 2024\u00a0report\u00a0from online real estate brokers Zillow and StreetEasy.",
      "\"If your income is rising at the same time your rent is, maybe that extra expense is no big deal,\" Matt Schulz, chief consumer finance analyst at LendingTree, said in the report. \"However, so many Americans' financial wiggle room is tiny, even in the best of times, so having to carve out hundreds of extra dollars to pay rent each month can be a big deal.\"",
      "Several factors explain why rents have surged, said Rob Bhatt, a consumer finance analyst at LendingTree. Perhaps most importantly, during the pandemic legions of newly remote workers moved to new markets, driving up rent\u00a0and housing prices.",
      "\"All the things that we saw during the pandemic have created stresses on the system, including stresses in these markets that traditionally haven't been renters' markets, and so it's going to take a little bit of time to adjust,\" he told CBS News.",
      "High home prices and rising mortgage rates, which have kept a lid on the number of homes coming to market, have also left more renters competing for a limited stock of affordable housing. Rents are projected to ease nationally next year, but only by 1%, according to a recent study from Realtor.com.",
      "Where have rents risen the most?",
      "New York, San Diego and Miami have seen the largest monthly rental increases for both one-bedroom units \u2014 which rose $854, $817 and $764 in the three cities, respectively, since 2020 \u2014 and two-bedroom units, which have jumped $857, $877 and $885, respectively, over the last five years.",
      "Rounding out the top 10 cities where one-bedroom rents have risen the most over the last five years, according to LendingTree (see chart below for a listing of the change in rents for the top 50 cities):",

      "Atlanta",

      "Boston",
      "Phoenix",
      "In New York and San Diego, the spike in rents is attributable mostly to the demand for housing exceeding supply, according to LendingTree. Renters in those metro areas face limited inventory and plenty of competition.",
      "LendingTree attributed the surge in rental prices in Miami to the local population boom, noting that strong domestic and international migration to the area has driven up demand.",
      "One high-priced city where rent increases have cooled is San Francisco. The cost of a one-bedroom unit in the city rose $54 a month, to an average of $2,977, over the last five years, while two-bedrooms rose $51 to $3,604, LendingTree found.",
      "Other cities where rents are growing more slowly are Birmingham, Ala.; Oklahoma City, Okla.; San Antonio, Texas; and St. Louis, Mo.",
      "LendingTree's findings are based on an analysis of fair-market rents (FMR) from the Department of Housing and Urban Development. The federal agency defines such rents as \"estimates of 40th percentile gross rents for standard-quality units within a metropolitan area or nonmetropolitan county.\" The firm's figures exclude rents for public housing and for units built within the past two years.",

    "story": [
      "Employers have cut more than 1.1 million jobs through November, the most since 2020, when companies laid off 2.2 million workers as the pandemic was slamming the U.S. economy, according to a new report from outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas.",
      "The layoffs represent a 54% increase from the same period a year earlier, when employers cut 761,358 jobs, according to the firm. It's also only the sixth time since 1993 that job cuts during the first 11 months of the year have risen above 1.1 million.",
      "Here's what is driving the increase in 2025 layoffs, according to Challenger.",
      "Tech is driving the surge in job cuts",
      "The technology sector is leading this year's job cuts, laying off 153,536 workers through November, according to Challenger. That's a 17% jump from the 130,701 layoffs tech firms announced by the same point in 2024.",
      "Amazon is among the tech firms that have announced substantial workforce reductions. In October, the company said it would cut 14,000 jobs as it leans on AI tools to boost efficiency.",
      "The retail sector reduced its workforce by 91,954 jobs through November, as consumers grapple with higher prices and pull back on spending on discretionary goods. While retailers typically ramp up hiring toward year-end to accommodate holiday shoppers, 2025 is shaping up to be the\u00a0weakest in 15 years for seasonal work.",

      "Layoffs from the Trump administration's Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, were a primary driver of job cuts, leading to nearly 300,000 job losses this year, according to the Challenger report. DOGE, a cost-cutting effort, reduced both funding and employment at some federal agencies earlier this year.",
      "DOGE accounted for another 21,000 indirect job cuts at private and nonprofit entities that lost federal funding.",
      "Market and economic conditions were cited as the cause behind an additional 245,086 layoffs. More than 178,500 workers lost jobs because a company store, unit or department closed. Companies cited restructuring as the reason for another 128,255 layoffs.",
      "Artificial intelligence advances accounted for 54,700 job cuts, while tariffs were cited for nearly 8,000. President Trump's levies on trade partners have raised costs for companies, prompting some to trim spending elsewhere, including on labor.",
      "Small businesses, which operate on thin margins, say the tariffs have hit them especially hard. New\u00a0data from payroll firm ADP\u00a0shows that private-sector employers cut 32,000 jobs in November, driven largely by firms with fewer than 50 employees. These smaller employers have borne the brunt of rising costs and ongoing policy uncertainty.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-cutting-income-tax-tariff-revenue/",
    "published": "Thu, 04 Dec 2025 15:14:11 -0500",
    "summary": "President Trump suggested Americans won't have to pay personal income taxes \"in the not-too-distant future\" because of rising U.S. tariffs.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump is floating an idea that could appeal to millions of budget-strained households: using tariff revenue to reduce, or even eliminate, the federal individual income tax. But tax experts are skeptical that import taxes could completely replace income tax, and they say a reduction in income taxes would largely benefit the nation's top earners.",
      "\"I believe that at some point in the not-too-distant future, you won't even have income tax to pay because the money we're taking in is so great,\" Mr. Trump said at a Dec. 2 Cabinet meeting, referring to the tariff revenues generated by the wide-ranging duties his administration has imposed on imports.",
      "Mr. Trump's suggestion comes as the Supreme Court is weighing the constitutionality of his tariffs, which are import taxes paid by U.S. companies that are typically passed partly on to American consumers in the form of higher prices. The Treasury Department this year has significantly boosted the country's collection of tariffs, thanks to Mr. Trump's policies.",
      "White House spokesman Kush Desai said in a statement that Mr. Trump \"is set to raise trillions in revenue for the federal government in the coming years with his tariffs \u2014 whose costs will ultimately be paid by the foreign exporters who rely on the American economy, the world's biggest and best consumer market.\"",
      "Despite the jump in tariff receipts, tax experts are skeptical that such revenue could ever replace individual income taxes.",
      "\"It is mechanically impossible to fully replace income tax revenues with tariffs,\" Erica York, vice president of federal tax policy at the Tax Foundation, a nonpartisan think tank, told CBS News. \"Any real attempt to do so would harm working-class Americans, damage the U.S. economy and significantly increase the federal budget deficit.\"",
      "York estimated the Trump administration's current tariff policy, assuming it remains in place, would generate about $2.1 trillion in revenue over the next decade. By comparison, federal individual income taxes would provide more than 10 times that amount, at $32 trillion over the same period, she said.",
      "Personal taxes provide about $2.7 trillion annually in federal revenue, according to IRS data. For fiscal year 2025, the U.S. generated $195 billion in tariff revenue, Treasury data\u00a0shows.",
      "\"Tariffs, even applied maximally, simply could not generate that level of revenue \u2014 imports are not a large enough tax base,\" York said.",
      "To be sure, tariff revenue could be used to provide a tax cut, said Scott Lincicome, vice president of general economics at the nonpartisan Cato Institute. However, because low-income households already pay little to no income tax, it's unlikely to help the families most in need of a financial boost, he noted.",
      "\"If they did a flat 3% reduction in income tax, the only people who would really benefit are the top 10%\" of income earners, Lincicome said.",
      "The top 10% of earners pay about 72% of the nation's income taxes, according to Tax Foundation data.",
      "What about a tariff dividend?",
      "Mr. Trump has also discussed the possibility of sending Americans a $2,000 \"tariff dividend\" check, an idea he reiterated during the Dec. 2 Cabinet meeting.",
      "Yet that proposal also faces a troublesome math problem, Lincicome said. Sending a one-time $2,000 payment to U.S. households would cost between $300 billion and $600 billion \u2014 far more than the U.S. is currently collecting in tariffs, he pointed out.",
      "Issuing a tariff payment or reducing income taxes also would require Congress to change the tax code \u2014 a tall legislative task given the ongoing partisanship in Congress. Some Republican lawmakers have already rebuffed the idea of a $2,000 payment, with Sen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin recently\u00a0saying\u00a0the U.S. \"can't afford\" it.",
      "Meanwhile, the U.S. is unlikely to raise enough tariff revenue to fund dividend checks or replace the individual income tax because that would require import taxes so high that Americans would stop buying most imported goods, causing tariff revenue to collapse, Lincicome explained.",
      "\"There is a hard cap on the amount of money you can raise with tariffs,\" he added. Economists \"say you can maybe raise $700 billion a year, which would be a very high effective tax rate \u2014 an across-the-board 20% to 30% tariff rate \u2014 but if it's pushed above that, nobody would buy imports.\"",
      "The overall average effective tariff rate facing U.S. consumers is now nearly 17%, the highest level since 1935, according to the\u00a0Yale Budget Lab, a nonpartisan policy research center.",
      "How do tariffs differ from income taxes?",
      "Setting aside the difference in the scale of revenue collection, tariffs are structured differently from income taxes. U.S. companies that import products, parts and other goods from abroad pay a fee based on the country of origin \u2014 for instance, American firms pay a 15% tariff on imports from the European Union.",
      "That means an American company importing a $5 Italian chocolate bar would pay the U.S. government an additional 75 cents, and then decide whether to pass that extra cost on to consumers or absorb it.",
      "Because of their structure, tariffs are often compared with sales taxes, where sellers pay a percentage of an item's cost when they check out at a store.",
      "By contrast, individual income taxes are progressive, meaning lower-income Americans pay a smaller tax rate than higher-earning households. The lowest bracket is 10%, while the top rate is 37%.",
      "Replacing the graduated income tax with a flat tariff rate would likely leave low- and middle-income households shouldering a bigger share of the burden than higher-income earners, York said.",
      "\"Tariffs are relatively flat, and even slightly regressive, placing a larger burden on working-class households than on the rich,\" she said. \"The income tax is the opposite \u2014 it is highly progressive and even provides negative income tax rates for the lowest income households.\"",
      "She added, \"Swapping a highly progressive income tax for a slightly regressive tariff scheme would harm the very households the president claims to be helping.\"",

    "published": "Thu, 04 Dec 2025 10:44:49 -0500",
    "summary": "A new report from Realtor.com projects that the housing market will shift in a more buyer-friendly direction in 2026.",
    "story": [
      "It's still a tough time to get a foothold in the housing market, with homes sitting near record values and mortgage rates parked well above 6%. But the tide could turn in 2026, with property prices forecast to dip in 22 of the largest 100 U.S. cities and mortgage rates expected to ease slightly, according to a new analysis from\u00a0Realtor.com.",
      "The real estate market is expected to move in a more \"buyer-friendly\" direction next year, leading to the \"most balanced housing market\" since the pandemic, meaning that neither sellers nor buyers are likely to have the upper hand in negotiations, said Jake Krimmel, a senior economist at Realtor.com.",
      "Mortgage rates are expected to dip to an average of 6.3% next year, a slight drop from 2025's 6.6% average rate. Lower borrowing costs, as well as strong wage growth next year, should encourage more buyers to jump into the market, Krimmel added.",
      "\"2026 is going to be a year where we think the market is going to steady,\" Krimmel said. \"It's going to show a lot of signs of getting back on track to what we consider to be normal.\"",
      "That will help push up existing-home sales, which are projected to increase less than 2% to 4.13 million properties in 2026, according to Realtor.com's report. That's only a slight bump from this year's projected 4.07 million home sales, but a notable change given that transactions have been relatively flat throughout 2025.",
      "Zillow, another online real estate marketplace, also expects the housing market will ease for homebuyers as inventory grows and mortgage rates tick down. The company projects existing home sales will rise to nearly 4.3 million next year, up 4.3% from its projected total for 2025. Mortgage rates are likely to hover just above 6%, according to Zillow \u2014 higher than in recent years, but modest by historical standards.",
      "Where will prices drop?",
      "Most of the 22 cities where home prices are forecast to drop next year are located in the Southeast and the West. For instance, seven of the eight largest cities in Florida are projected to see declines in home prices next year, with the sole exception of Miami, the report said.",
      "The Cape Coral-Fort Lauderdale metropolitan area is expected to see the nation's largest price decline next year, with homes dropping by 10.2%, the analysis says. That's followed by the North Port-Sarasota-Bradenton, Florida region, with an 8.9% decline.",
      "The cities with projected price drops include those where inventory has expanded, providing more choices for buyers, Krimmel said. Some of those metropolitan areas may now also have lighter demand from buyers compared with the COVID-era\u00a0real estate boom, which was fueled by low mortgage rates and a shift to work-at-home policies.",
      "\"These places, among others, saw a huge frenzy during the pandemic, so part of what we are projecting is that demand continuing to come back down to earth,\" Krimmel told CBS News.",
      "Prices are expected to rise in the other 78 largest U.S. cities, but the hikes are likely to be small, with a median price gain of 4% across those locations.",
      "To make its projections,\u00a0Realtor.com\u00a0examined inventory, new construction, price growth, wage and job growth, and unemployment across the 100 cities.",

    "story": [
      "Trump accounts are a new type of tax-deferred investment vehicle for U.S. children, created under President Trump's \"big, beautiful bill\" tax and spending bill, which promises $1,000 seed contributions from the federal government for eligible kids.",

      "Who is eligible for a Trump account?",
      "Children who are U.S. citizens and who are born between Jan. 1, 2025, and Dec. 31, 2028, are eligible to have a Trump Account, according to a fact sheet from the Department of the Treasury. Households of any income may open an account, and all such accounts qualify for a one-time $1,000 contribution from the U.S. government.",
      "Families with children under 18 may also open accounts, but they won't receive the $1,000 gift from the government. However, parents, friends, employers and other parties can contribute tax-free dollars to an account.",
      "How do I open a Trump account?",
      "Parents or guardians must set up and manage the account until a child turns 18.",
      "The Treasury Department said households should use IRS Form 4547 to open a Trump account on behalf of a child. The newly created form is also where applicants can request the $1,000 U.S. government contribution to the account. The White House said that each Trump account for eligible children will launch with a $1,000 contribution from the government.",
      "In May 2026, the Treasury Department will send instructions to individuals who applied for government-funded accounts on how to activate them.",
      "When can I set up an account?",
      "Families can open a Trump account beginning in early 2026 and can start making financial contributions on July 4, 2026, according to the Trump Administration.",
      "How much can I contribute?",
      "Excluding the government's $1,000 donation, a total of $5,000 per child can be deposited into an account each year. Employers can contribute up to $2,500 per year to an employee's account tax-free, which will count toward the $5,000 limit.",
      "Financial contributions from cities, states, tribal governments and tax-exempt organizations, including nonprofit organizations, are generally not counted toward the $5,000 limit, according to employment law firm\u00a0Littler.",
      "Annual contribution limits to the accounts are indexed to inflation and will be adjusted after 2027, according to a notice from the Internal Revenue Service.",
      "Can funds be withdrawn before a child turns 18?",
      "No. Families may not withdraw funds from a Trump account before a child turns 18, except for the following reasons:",
      "A rollover of the entire account to a Trump account with another brokerage\u00a0Certain rollovers to an \"Achieving a Better Life Experience\"\u00a0account in the year the child turns 17\u00a0Distribution when the individual dies",
      "A rollover of the entire account to a Trump account with another brokerage",
      "Certain rollovers to an \"Achieving a Better Life Experience\"\u00a0account in the year the child turns 17",
      "Distribution when the individual dies",
      "After age 18, standard IRA rules for withdrawals apply.",
      "How will money in a Trump account be invested?",
      "Under the \"big, beautiful bill,\" funds in a Trump account must be invested in an authorized investment, such as mutual funds or exchange-traded funds that track the S&P 500 stock index or another index with mostly U.S. equities. Financial firms managing the funds also may not charge more than 0.1% in annual fees.",
      "Should I personally invest in the account?",
      "Financial experts advise people considering opening a Trump account to accept the government's $1,000 contribution \u2014 money is money, after all \u2014 but to think twice about putting in their own money. The reason: Other types of savings plans \u2014 such as a\u00a0529 plan, a tax-advantaged savings account for education expenses, or a custodial brokerage account, an investment account for a minor managed by an adult \u2014 can be more financially advantageous.",
      "\"The gift is the biggest part of this. It really is free money,\" Madeline Brown, a wealth and financial policy expert at the Urban Institute, a nonpartisan think tank in Washington, D.C., told CBS News.",
      "\"It's a nice perk for parents with children who qualified,\" added Kate Ashford, a wealth management specialist at personal finance company NerdWallet. \"But it's not a slam dunk, and it's not going to do as much for you as other accounts.\"",
      "She cited the accounts' contribution caps and more limited investment tax advantages as drawbacks compared to 529s or custodial brokerage accounts.",
      "\"The only advantage is your earnings grow tax-free over the years, but you pay the ordinary income tax rate \u2014 not, say, a capital gains tax rate,\" Ashford said.",
      "Adam Michel, director of tax policy studies at the Cato Institute, a libertarian public policy research firm, thinks there are better ways to set money aside for children, such as in a 529 or standard IRA account.",
      "\"Generally speaking, parents should not put their own money into a Trump account,\" he told CBS News. \"The primary use case for the accounts is to receive free money from sources like the government or private donations.\"",
      "For example, Michael and Susan Dell on Tuesday said they would donate a total of $6.25 billion \u2014 or $250 apiece \u2014 to millions of kids in Trump accounts.",
      "How do Trump accounts compare to a 529 savings plan?",
      "The government's initial starter deposit is an appealing feature of Trump accounts, according to experts. Beyond the seed money, however, they offer fewer benefits than other savings plans, according to the nonpartisan Tax Foundation.",
      "\"A simpler approach would consolidate today's patchwork of savings accounts into universal savings accounts that are flexible, tax-neutral and easier for families to use,\" the policy research group added in a report.",
      "To save money for college, a 529 plan, which lets families sock away money for education expenses tax-free, could be a better alternative, investment experts said. Savings from such an account can also be transferred to an IRA, offering account holders more flexibility to save for retirement or other expenses.",
      "The Trump accounts have \"many more strings attached and complicated rules that make it not an attractive overall investment vehicle,\" Michel of the Cato Institute said.",
      "To be sure, 529 plans also have limitations. If people use funds for non-education expenses, for example, they must pay a 10% penalty.",
      "Meanwhile, a Trump account offers some flexibility. Beneficiaries, once they are adults, may use the money for purposes beyond education, such as buying a home or starting a business, while the accounts also can serve as a kind of IRA.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-new-fuel-economy-standards-mpg-biden/",
    "published": "Thu, 04 Dec 2025 09:44:55 -0500",
    "summary": "The Trump administration proposed rules that would weaken fuel economy standards for vehicles set under President Biden in 2024.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration is proposing new fuel economy standards for vehicles that would roll back efficiency rules implemented under former President Biden.",
      "Under the Transportation Department proposal, which was unveiled at a White House event on Wednesday, automakers would need to meet less stringent vehicle mileage requirements.",
      "Federal fuel economy rules are overseen by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) under what's known as the\u00a0CAFE (Corporate Average Fuel Economy) Standards. Enacted by Congress in 1975, the regulations stipulate how many miles vehicles must be able to drive on a gallon of fuel, with specific standards for light-duty vehicles, as well as medium- and heavy-duty trucks.",
      "The rules aim to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and help consumers save money on gas, according to the Transportation Department. Critics of the fuel standards have long argued they are costly for automakers, which must make technological improvements to reduce fuel usage, raising vehicle prices.",
      "The revamped fuel standards would reverse a Biden policy that \"forced automakers to build cars using expensive technologies that drove up costs, drove up prices and made the car much worse,\" Mr. Trump said on Wednesday.",
      "Rules would sharply lower mileage standard",
      "If finalized, the plan would relax fuel economy standards by setting the industry average for light-duty vehicles at roughly 34.5 miles per gallon through the 2031 model year, lower than the 50 miles per gallon outlined by a Biden-era rule.",
      "On Wednesday, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said the previous rules drove up the cost of new cars and were \"completely unattainable\" for automakers. He initially\u00a0directed\u00a0NHTSA to review the CAFE regulations in January.",
      "The Transportation Department said the proposal is projected to save American families $1,000 on the average cost of a new vehicle and a total of $109 billion over the next five years.",
      "NHTSA Administrator Jonathan Morrison said the move to ease the mileage standards would make the nation's roads safer. \"Newer cars are safer cars and by reducing vehicle prices, more American families will be able to afford newer vehicles,\" he said in a statement.",
      "Mr. Trump was joined at Wednesday's event by senior auto industry executives.\u00a0In a statement shared with CBS News, Stellantis CEO Antonioa Filosa expressed support for the proposed fuel efficiency rules, saying the initiative would realign the CAFE standards \"with real-world market conditions as part of its wider vision for a growing U.S. automotive industry.\"",
      "General Motors also backed the proposed fuel economy standards, which would need to undergo an official rulemaking process before being adopted.",
      "\"GM supports the goals of NHTSA's proposed CAFE rule and its intention to better align fuel economy standards with market realities. We have long advocated for one national standard that upholds customer choice and provides the auto industry long-term stability,\" a spokesperson for the automaker said in a statement.",
      "The fuel economy proposal would roll back\u00a0a rule\u00a0finalized in June 2024 under the Biden administration aimed at raising the minimum gas mileage for passenger cars and light trucks by model year 2031.",
      "At the time, NHTSA said the new regulations would save Americans $23 billion at the gas pump and reduce pollution. Burning gas for vehicles is a major contributor to carbon emissions, which scientists have linked to climate change.",
      "The rules were also intended to spur automakers to produce more electric vehicles, a key Biden administration priority for the nation's transportation sector.",
      "Would new MPG rules ease car prices?",
      "CarEdge CEO Zach Shefska described the Trump administration proposal as a win for automakers, but said consumers shouldn't expect to see lower car prices right away. That's because automakers work at least five years ahead in their product development, he said, meaning it would take a while before any redesigned cars make it onto the road.",
      "If the proposal eventually does help lower vehicle prices, he said, \"It will happen years from now, not in the coming weeks or months.\"",
      "The Center for Biological Diversity, a nonprofit organization that works to protect endangered species, said the Transportation Department proposal will increase the country's oil consumption and undermine the competitiveness of U.S. automakers.",
      "\"Trump's action will feed America's destructive use of oil, while hamstringing us in the green tech race against Chinese and other foreign carmakers,\" said Dan Becker, director of the Center for Biological Diversity's Safe Climate Transport Campaign.",
      "Wednesday's move is the latest effort by the Trump administration to reverse Biden-era policies that encouraged automakers to build cleaner-running cars and trucks, including electric vehicles. The administration scrapped EV\u00a0tax credits\u00a0in September and has also proposed rules to eliminate\u00a0gas emission regulations.",

    "summary": "Kian Sadeghi, the 25-year-old founder and CEO at Nucleus Genomics, tells \"CBS Mornings\" that parents have every right to select the qualities and traits they desire in their child.",
    "story": [
      "Big leaps in science have made a once-impossible, much-debated question come to life: Would you design your unborn child?",
      "Kian Sadeghi, the 25-year-old founder and CEO at Nucleus Genomics, believes every parent has a right to do just that, selecting qualities they desire \u2013 from height to weight to intelligence. He calls it \"genetic optimization,\" and it's part of a Silicon Valley push to breed \"super-babies.\"",
      "Sadeghi dropped out of the University of Pennsylvania and started the company in 2021, inspired by a cousin who died of a rare genetic illness. Backed by investors and prominent tech entrepreneurs like Peter Thiel and Alexis Ohanian, Sadeghi says his company has already helped thousands of families.",
      "\"It's the parents' right to know\"",
      "\"We give you the full range of insights there is to know about your future child. We really think it's the parents' right to know,\" he told \"CBS Mornings\" in an interview that aired Wednesday.",
      "Genetic testing companies like Nucleus say DNA screening of embryos can prevent disease, while also giving parents a unique ability to compare and choose traits that make up a healthier baby \u2013 and one that's more desirable in the eyes of mom and dad.",
      "\"They want us to, you know, play sports and they want us to go to the best school. They want us to be well educated. They want us to thrive. Life, I think, as a parent doesn't just stop at 'I want my child to be healthy,'\" Sadeghi said.",
      "For $30,000, Nucleus offers a program called IVF+, which includes full DNA scans of both parents and up to 20 embryos conceived through in vitro fertilization. The results come back in the form of a sleek, user-friendly menu.",
      "Advanced DNA screenings",
      "The company screens embryo samples for more than 2,000 traits and conditions, including eye color, hair color, intelligence \u2013 even acne. It also can estimate genetic predisposition to medical conditions such as depression, autism and bipolar disorder.",
      "Sadeghi says this \"genetic optimization\" allows parents to minimize disease while maximizing traits they prefer. However, critics have drawn comparisons to a different term: \"eugenics.\"",
      "\"[It's not eugenics] by any stretch, because it's fundamentally about empowering people with information that they can use to give their child the best start in life,\" he said. \"And yes, if you want 2 inches taller for your child, 3 inches taller, right, if you want a couple IQ-point difference, absolutely, by all means, do that. But I'm saying, you're really asking me here, you're asking me, what is life about? That's what you're really getting at when you talk about height and IQ, right, they're abstractions of life.\"",
      "Ethical debate over reproductive genetics",
      "But while companies like Nucleus continue to grow, some medical experts point to the ethical dilemmas surrounding these types of new reproductive technologies. An article published in the MIT Technology Review in October argued the race to create the \"perfect baby\" is actually creating an \"ethical mess.\"",
      "In a\u00a0statement last year, the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics said the practice of genetic screenings and use of polygenic risk scores for embryo selection has \"moved too fast with too little evidence.\"",
      "\"In this statement we do not address either individual or broader social, ethical, and regulatory issues this testing raises,\" the group noted.",
      "But Sadeghi said he remains confident in the data.",
      "\"Our predictors can better predict longevity from an embryo's DNA than any other genetic model ever built,\" he said.",
      "However, he pushes back on the criticism that he's creating a new class of \"superhumans.\"",
      "\"DNA is not destiny, the messiness of life, the nurture element of life, right, how hard your child works, you know, what school they go to, what resources they have, serendipity, all those factors are never, ever going to go away,\" Sadeghi said.",

      "The money will be given to most children ages 10 and younger who were born before the qualifying date of the Trump accounts, which were created earlier this year through the Republicans' tax and spending bill. Those accounts are designed to provide $1,000 to babies born during President Trump's second term in office.",

The Dells said they are encouraging others to join in by contributing funds to the accounts, ranging from other philanthropists and businesses to childrens' families and friends.",
      "\"We believe the smartest investment we can make is the one in children,\" Michael Dell told \"CBS News 24/7 Mornings\" in a Tuesday interview. \"We know that when a child has an account like this, even a modest sum, it really improves their outlook on life, and they are more likely to graduate from high school and college, and buy a home, start a business, start a family, become productive members of society.\"",
      "Susan Dell added that the gift builds on the couple's previous philanthropic efforts to help children through their foundation. The pair announced the program on Giving Tuesday, an annual event where people are encouraged to make charitable contributions.",
      "\"When we heard about this, for us, this was a natural fit,\" Susan Dell told \"CBS News 24/7 Mornings.\" \"This was going to reach a lot of children and help them have a start at a really bright future.\"",
      "Dell Technologies \u2014 the company founded by Michael Dell, where he serves as CEO \u2014 said in June that it had pledged to match the Treasury Department's $1,000 contributions to the Trump Accounts. The Dell corporate match will be provided to every child born to its U.S.-based employees between Jan. 1, 2025, and Dec. 31, 2028, the company said in an email to CBS News.",

      "Every child born in the U.S. between Jan. 1, 2025, and Jan. 1, 2029, with a Social Security number, and whose parents have Social Security numbers, would be automatically enrolled in the program, according to Invest America.",
      "Sign-ups are slated to begin on July 4, 2026, with parents and caregivers needed to activate the accounts. The Department of Treasury will seed the accounts with $1,000 per child, while parents, friends and others can also contribute up to $5,000 per year.",
      "Signing up will be easy, according to details released by the Trump adminstration on Tuesday. Parents or guardians will need to file an IRS Form 4547, a one-page document that asks for basic information such as a child's home address and Social Security number, to activate the account.",
      "The accounts are limited to investing in broad U.S. stock funds that track the overall market, such as a S&P 500 fund, don't use leverage and charge no more than 0.1% in annual fees. Parents can make elections for their children's accounts at trumpaccounts.gov.",

    "summary": "Rep. Anna Paulina Luna is seeking to force a vote on a bipartisan bill that would ban members of Congress from trading individual stocks.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Rep. Anna Paulina Luna on Tuesday followed through on a monthslong threat to try to force a vote on a bipartisan bill that would ban members of Congress from trading individual stocks.",
      "Luna, a Florida Republican, introduced a discharge petition to circumvent House leaders and put the measure on the floor for a vote if it receives 218 signatures. The procedural maneuver has become a common tactic for rank-and-file lawmakers to try to force a vote on issues ignored by Republican leaders.",
      "The congresswoman had threatened to file a discharge petition if there wasn't movement on the Restore Trust in Congress Act by the end of September. But the push for a vote was stalled by the 43-day government shutdown that began on Oct. 1. House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, kept the House out of session during the shutdown, putting all committee hearings and markups of legislation on hiatus.",
      "Dozens of House lawmakers across the political spectrum have coalesced behind the Restore Trust in Congress Act, which would prohibit members of Congress, their spouses and dependent children from owning or trading individual stocks. The compromise bill was introduced by Republican Rep. Chip Roy of Texas in September and has the support of more than 100 members, including progressives, conservatives and moderate Republicans and Democrats.",
      "But the bill is also facing bipartisan opposition, according to its cosponsors, who spoke to reporters ahead of a Nov. 19 hearing before the House Administration Committee about congressional stock trading.",
      "\"There are members in both parties who do not want this to happen, who are in the ear of leadership, who are trying to stop this from happening,\" Democratic Rep. Seth Magaziner of Rhode Island said.",
      "Under a 13-year-old law known as the STOCK Act, members of Congress, executive branch officials and other federal employees are prohibited from using nonpublic information for their financial benefit. The law also requires officials to disclose stock trades exceeding $1,000 within 45 days.",
      "Critics say the law needs reforms to require more transparency to ensure public officials are not using their positions for personal gain.",
      "\"This body has been enriching itself on the taxpayers' dime for too dadgum long, and it's got to stop,\" Republican Rep. Tim Burchett of Tennessee told reporters. \"We're in committee meetings. We hear things before y'all do. We can make those connections.\"",
      "Dan Savickas, the vice president of policy and government affairs at the Taxpayers Protection Alliance, told lawmakers during the hearing that \"on average, members of both political parties outperformed the market.\"",
      "\"Each party's performance gets a boost when they control more branches of government,\" Savickas said. \"This only lends further credence to the public perception that congressional representatives are using their office for personal gain rather than public service.\"",
      "No member of Congress has ever been prosecuted under the current law and no public records exist indicating that any officials have ever paid fines for disclosure errors, according to James R. Copland, a senior fellow at Manhattan Institute for Policy Research, a conservative think tank.",
      "Luna called\u00a0last month's hearing \"for show,\" and expressed concern that watered-down legislation \"with no teeth\" could end up on the floor instead of the compromise bill.",

    "summary": "Flyers without Real IDs, passports or other accepted forms of identification will need to pay a $45 fee starting Feb. 1.",
    "story": [
      "U.S. air travelers who haven't upgraded to a Real ID can still fly without one, but starting Feb. 1 they'll be charged a $45 fee, the Transportation Security Administration\u00a0said\u00a0Monday.",
      "Flyers without a Real ID, a passport or another acceptable form of ID will need to have their identities confirmed through a fee-based verification system called TSA Confirm.ID, the agency said.",
      "The announcement of a $45 fee for people without Real IDs comes after the TSA started requiring the identification or other approved documents in May. The Real ID is a federally compliant state driver's license, learner's permit or nondriver ID card, identified by a black or gold star in the upper right corner.",
      "Passengers without Real IDs \"will be referred to the optional TSA Confirm.ID process for identity verification upon TSA check-in and prior to entering the security line,\" the TSA said.",
      "The process will vary from airport to airport, according to the agency, which said it is working with private vendors to allow consumers to pay for the screening process before they arrive at the airport. The TSA warned that people without Real IDs could encounter increased wait times at airports while their identities are verified.",
      "The fee verifies passengers for a 10-day period, according to the TSA. The agency is still urging passengers without Real IDs to visit their local DMV to update their IDs.",
      "The $45 fee is designed to ensure that travelers, not taxpayers, foot the bill for the advanced verification system, said Adam Stahl, a TSA official, in the statement.",
      "Some travel experts said the new fee disadvantages lower-income Americans and that the 10-day verification window could cause confusion.",
      "The policy creates \"a bizarre situation where your identity expires like a carton of milk,\" travel expert Julian Kheel, founder of flight search engine Points Path, told CBS News. \"After those 10 days pass, you're back to square one, forced to pay another $45 even though nothing about your actual identity has changed.\"",
      "How does Confirm.ID work?",
      "Confirm.ID asks passengers without Real IDs to answer a series of questions about themselves to verify their identity.",
      "Once a passenger's identity is confirmed, they'll receive a receipt to show a screening agent at the TSA checkpoint, along with their form of ID. They will then continue through security like all other passengers.",
      "Passengers who don't have Real IDs and opt not to pay the $45 fee may be denied entry at checkpoints, the TSA said Monday during a press call describing the new fee-based program.",
      "What's an acceptable form of ID?",
      "Travelers with Real IDs or other accepted forms of identification don't have to pay the $45 fee to travel. Here are some of the documents the TSA says can substitute for a Real-ID-compliant driver's license:",

      "The TSA had previously proposed a rule that would charge travelers without a Real ID an $18 fee at security checkpoints, according to a\u00a0notice\u00a0published in the Federal Register earlier this month.",
      "The cost of getting a Real ID varies by state. New York, for example, has no additional fee for a Real ID beyond the regular cost of getting a driver's license or renewing it, but\u00a0Pennsylvania\u00a0charges a \"one-time $30 Real ID fee\" on top of standard renewal fees.",

    "published": "Tue, 02 Dec 2025 14:08:34 -0500",
    "summary": "Personal finance is too complex for most people to navigate, two economists contend in a new book. Is there a better way to help people deal with money?",
    "story": [
      "Americans typically score poorly in financial literacy tests. Yet they're on their own when it comes to making major financial decisions, from funding their retirement to buying a home, two economists argue in a new book that critiques the personal finance system.",
      "Take the U.S. retirement system, which has shifted away from corporate-based pensions that guaranteed income in old age toward 401(k) plans, where workers must decide how to invest their savings.",
      "In theory, taking control of your investment decisions should be empowering, but the current U.S. retirement system \"appears too complex for many people to understand,\" write Harvard University economist John Campbell and Imperial College London economist Tarun Ramadorai in \"Fixed: Why Personal Finance Is Broken and How to Make It Work for Everyone,\" published by Princeton University Press.",
      "Despite some recent changes in how personal finance is practiced in the U.S., such as automatic enrollment in 401(k)s that were inspired by behavioral economist Richard Thaler's research about \"nudges\" \u2014 small changes that can steer people to make positive financial decisions \u2014 millions of Americans remain woefully unprepared to weather the financial strains of old age.",
      "Stronger medicine is needed, Campbell and Ramadorai say. Rather than a nudge, they call for a combination of regulatory and industry changes designed to overhaul the country's approach to personal finance \u2014 a broader shift they describe as a \"shove.\"",
      "\"We've learned that people make many mistakes, and particularly, sadly, less educated and poorer people tend to make worse mistakes,\" Campbell told CBS News.",
      "Their book proposes a \"starter kit\" of personal finance options, such as retirement accounts that automatically enroll people when they start their first job and stay with them throughout their careers, along with savings accounts that pay interest at the same rate and carry clear, transparent fees.",
      "CBS News spoke with Campbell and Ramdorai about their new book. It has been edited for length and clarity.",
      "CBS News: You write that most Americans are financially illiterate, according to one\u00a0basic assessment. Yet you say that introducing personal finance classes in high school isn't the solution. Why?",
      "Campbell: A simple way to put it is that you have a race between financial literacy and the complexity of the products people are offered, and the decisions they're asked to make. And complexity has been winning the race.",
      "Yes, young people in high school do have to make some big decisions \u2014 taking on student debt, going to college. They may also get a credit card, and then they have to manage their credit score. But there are a lot of other decisions they won't make until much later in life.",
      "It's as if we were trying to teach people to drive by just having the classroom component of driver's ed, without putting the kids behind the wheel.",
      "Ramadorai: All of us are also consumers in the personal finance system, and if you ask me what fraction of my daily time I spend thinking about my own personal finance situation, it's probably fairly small. But the financial sector is entirely focused \u2014 especially those on the personal finance side \u2014 on trying to get this right. So there's a sort of uneven competition between me, however educated I may be, and the financial sector, who is doing this on an industrial scale.",
      "For us to say, \"Oh, well, you know, if only you had taken the time and trouble to be educated, you wouldn't be in the situation you're in right now,\" that seems a bit glib. We're proposing not just putting all of the burden of responsibility on individuals.",
      "You advocate for \"shoves\" instead of \"nudges\" to ensure people are on the proper financial path. Can you elaborate?",
      "Ramadorai: We've seen lots of good examples of these nudges \u2014 for example, auto-enrollment into pension plans. That seems like it's a very well-functioning, effective policy until you start to look a little bit more closely at it. Research is starting to emerge that, in some cases, what happens is that the default contribution rate can actually either be too high or too low, depending on what kind of person you are.",
      "There's a kind of characterization or a caricature of academics as, \"All you want is, you just want the government to come in and fix everything.\" That's really not what we're about in this book.",
      "What we're trying to say is that we believe very strongly in the power of capitalism to produce products that are extremely high quality and are delivered at very low prices. But the energy of capitalism has been perverted.",
      "Campbell: We'd like to make personal finance shopping more like buying a painkiller when you have a headache. You know, you walk into the pharmacy, you go to the shelf. There's ibuprofen, there's Advil, there's the generic \u2014 it's all on the same shelf. The active ingredient is the same, the dosage is the same, and there's a little label on the shelf that shows you the price per unit.",
      "We think personal finance, unfortunately, is a long way away from that right now. It's more like the world of unregulated medicine 120 years ago, when people were selling legitimate medicines, but they were also selling snake oil, and it was very hard for individuals to tell the difference.",
      "You're suggesting that personal finance should be more tightly regulated. Critics of that idea might argue that this would chill innovation in personal finance. What's your view?",
      "Ramadorai:\u00a0There are areas where even the most laissez-faire among us would agree that there's a role for government intervention. Think about civil aviation.",
      "Civil aviation transports very large numbers of people across vast distances at a relatively low cost, and what we don't necessarily want is for people to come in and innovate in that space in a way that introduces risks, because we're super averse to the fact that we don't want these things falling out of the sky.",
      "The other one, of course, is basic utilities. You want the lights to be on \u2014 electricity companies are regulated in a particular way, there's piping that goes to houses for running water. We think that there's a strong role for government to play in having regulation in those areas.",
      "Our argument is that there are vast areas of personal finance that are just as important as any of those basic utilities. It is the plumbing that makes our financial system work.",
      "Campbell: We instead propose a forward-looking, design-focused approach to regulation, where we ask the regulators to get very specific about what a basic financial product should look like. We call these \"starter kit products.\" They can offer a wide range of products. And the starter kit product should be designed so that it is simple, safe, cheap and easy.",
      "If you could redesign how personal finance works in the U.S. from the ground up, what would be the first feature you would build in?",
      "Campbell:\u00a0Number one, I would create a universal retirement account. I would give it a Roth structure that is open for people, automatically upon the date of first employment, and then you can carry it with you across all jobs that you have subsequently.",
      "That would fix the problem we have at the moment \u2014 we have this immense profusion of accounts, and as people change jobs, they very often end up with multiple 401(k)s. But at the same time, people who work for small businesses or who are self-employed \u2014 maybe they open an IRA, maybe they don't \u2014 but the contribution limits are much lower, and so we have an access problem.",
      "Ramadorai:\u00a0Right now in the United States, there's a lock-in problem [with mortgages], which is that interest rates have gone up so high that it's compromising mobility for most people in the U.S. So people are sitting on 2% mortgages, and they're absolutely reluctant to move, even if there's a great job opportunity somewhere else, because they would have to refinance into a much higher rate.",
      "There's a feature of mortgage markets that exists in other places, which is called portability, where you simply take your old mortgage with you to the new place \u2014 you then get the lender to reassess the collateral on the new place, and then you're able to take your mortgage with you. That increases mobility and keeps the labor market functioning well.",
      "You could also have a different feature, which is called assumability, where the buyer of your house actually is able to take on your cheap mortgage, assuming that they pass the appropriate credit checks and so on.",
      "Both of those features, portability and assumability, would be really good additions to the U.S. mortgage market.",

      "Shopify services were temporarily interrupted as an outage at the e-commerce platform disrupted retailers on Cyber Monday, one of the busiest\u00a0online shopping days of the entire year.",

    "published": "Mon, 01 Dec 2025 20:33:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Relief will take time, because coffee roasters and caf\u00e9s typically order beans months in advance.",
    "story": [
      "As one of America's coffee capitals, Portland, Oregon, has grounds for worry: coffee prices have soared to historic highs.",
      "\"We have bags of coffee on our menu that are $28.50. That's a lot of money for a bag of coffee,\" said Laila Ghambari, owner of Guilder Coffee Company, a caf\u00e9 that sells specialty coffee.",
      "Ghambari and her brothers practically grew up inside an espresso machine. Her father owned a coffee shop, and Ghambari became the U.S. barista champion in 2014. Now, she's a small business owner grappling with the expense of tariffs, which are still impacting her business even though coffee and other products were granted an exemption last month.",
      "\"Any coffee that's already landed in the United States is still subject to the tariff,\" Ghambari said.",
      "Coffee prices were already high due to supply and demand pressures for premium beans along with climate issues, especially crop-killing frost. The average retail price of 100% ground roast coffee hit a record high of $9.14 per pound in September, according to\u00a0the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. In December 2019, shortly before the COVID-19 pandemic, one pound of ground coffee cost a little over $4. And in August, retail coffee prices in the U.S. had jumped 20.9% from the previous year, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics \u2014 the sharpest increase in nearly three decades.",
      "Then, back in April, the U.S. imposed a so-called reciprocal tariff of 10% on coffee-producing countries. Ghambari said it cost her roughly fifty cents a bag.",
      "Christopher Hendon, a chemistry professor at the University of Oregon   known as \"Dr. Coffee,\" studies the global industry and said the tariffs cost independent coffee operators more than consumers.",
      "\"[The consumer is] probably not feeling it,\" Hendon said. \"You might not care today, because the price didn't change all that much, but you might care if your local caf\u00e9 disappears.\"",
      "Charlie Wicker's company, Trailhead Coffee Roasters, roasts green beans into brown ones. Tariffs hit him hard.",
      "\"I had to lay off the two full-time employees. So now it's down to just myself and one part-time employee,\" Wicker said, adding, \"The fact that we're still standing is a function of having a little bit of savings to keep the lights on.\"",
      "Despite the reversal that lifted tariffs on coffee, relief will take time because coffee roasters and caf\u00e9s typically order beans months in advance.",
      "Ghambari said it won't be until February when the first import of tariff-free coffees will land in her warehouse.",
      "For Wicker, who delivers to caf\u00e9s, lifting those tariffs could be the coffee break he needs.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/black-friday-cyber-monday-2025-spending-deals-inflation/",
    "published": "Mon, 01 Dec 2025 15:43:35 -0500",
    "summary": "Holiday spending is hitting new records, but some data shows that people are buying fewer items amid higher prices.",
    "story": [
      "Americans may not be feeling jolly about their economic prospects, but that didn't stop shoppers from opening their wallets on Black Friday and driving spending to new records. Despite record holiday sales, however, other signs suggest consumers are getting a smaller bang for their buck because of rising inflation and stingier seasonal discounts.",
      "Consumers spent a combined $11.8 billion online on Nov. 28 during the shopping blitz, a 9.1% jump from last year, Adobe Analytics said. Including in-store sales, Americans spent 4.1% more on Black Friday than a year earlier,\u00a0according to Mastercard SpendingPulse.",
      "Purchases on Cyber Monday are also expected to be strong, with Adobe forecasting shoppers will spend a record $14.2 billion online today, which would amount to a more than 6% jump from a year ago.",
      "The resilience of the American consumer has helped buoy the economy even as it faces headwinds ranging from higher costs from the Trump administration's tariffs to a spike in corporate layoffs amid a slowing labor market.",
      "Inflation remains a problem",
      "Yet while discounts dangled by retailers from Walmart to Amazon helped fuel spending, beneath the record sales are signs of weakness, according to online sales data from Salesforce.com. Discounts this year aren't as deep, with the average selling price of goods rising 7% from a year ago, while consumers bought 2% fewer items at checkout, Salesforce said.",
      "\"A lot of growth is being driven by higher prices, and this means the growth in the number of things that people buy is significantly less,\" Neil Saunders, an analyst at GlobalData, told CBS News. \"So far this year, we have retail volume growth running at about 0.3%, which is very low growth.\"",
      "He added, \"This is one of the reasons some consumers feel a little gloomy when they see their dollars don't stretch as far as they once did.\"",
      "Inflation ticked up to 3% in September on an annual basis, according to the latest available Consumer Price Index data. That's up from a low this year of 2.3% in April.",
      "Experts say tighter household budgets are causing many consumers to watch their spending, such as by focusing on a few \"big ticket\" purchases, or spreading out what they buy over days of promotions in hopes of getting the most bang for their buck.",
      "Affordability pinch",
      "Consumer spending is vital to the U.S. economy because it represents about 70 cents of every $1 of gross domestic product. With consumer confidence falling last month to its lowest point since April, there were questions about whether the holiday season would bring cheer or gloom to retailers.",
      "Some Americans are also facing an affordability pinch, with costs for everything from groceries to utility bills on the rise. According to Deloitte's 2025 holiday study, three-quarters of shoppers reported bracing for higher prices during the holidays.",
      "Consumer spending in 2025 has been largely driven by high-income households, with the top 10% accounting for nearly half of all spending in the second quarter, according to an\u00a0analysis\u00a0of Federal Reserve data by Mark Zandi, chief economist at financial research firm Moody's Analytics.",
      "Spending among the bottom 80% of households \u2014 or those earning less than $175,000 a year \u2014 has \"simply kept pace with inflation since the pandemic,\" Zandi wrote in a September social media post.",
      "That's creating a so-called\u00a0K-shaped economy, with high-earning Americans spending more, while middle- and low-income households are holding back due to rising costs.",
      "\"Virtually all major holiday outlooks point to a bifurcated consumer,\" Kent Smetters of the Penn Wharton Budget Model, a nonpartisan research project at the University of Pennsylvania, said in an email. \"Widening behavioral gap \u2014 high-income households spending and staying online; lower-income households more selective, financed and volume-conscious.\"",
      "For now, both discount retailers and luxury stores appear to be outperforming this season, Saunders noted.",
      "\"So far, we're seeing value-focused retailers like Walmart and off-price do well,\" he said. \"Some of the accessible luxury brands, such as Coach and Ralph Lauren, are also doing really well. So there are winners out there, but the low-volume growth means that there are losers, too.\"",

    "story": [
      "A long-lost painting by Baroque master Peter Paul Rubens, which was hidden for more than four centuries, sold for $2.7 million at an auction Sunday in Versailles.",
      "The painting was recently found in a private townhouse in Paris. It depicts the crucifixion of Jesus Christ.",
      "It was part of a French collection and was initially thought to be from one of the many Rubens workshops that existed at the time. The artwork was rarely valued at more than $11,500.",
      "\"I immediately had a hunch about this painting, and I did everything I could to try to have it authenticated,\" auctioneer Jean-Pierre Osenat told The Associated Press. \"And finally, we managed to have it authenticated by the Rubenianum, which is the Rubens committee in Antwerp.\"",
      "Osenat told AFP earlier this year the picture was \"a masterpiece\" which was painted by Rubens when he was \"at the height of his talent.\"",
      "The painting was authenticated by German art historian Nils Buttner, known for his research on the master of the Flemish Baroque, Osenat said. Its provenance was certified through methods including X-ray imaging and pigment analysis, he added.",
      "B\u00fcttner explained before the auction that the master often painted crucifixions but rarely depicted \"the crucified Christ as a dead body on the cross.\"",
      "\"So this is the one and only painting showing blood and water coming out of the side wound of Christ, and this is something that Rubens only painted once.\"",
      "The Osenat auction house said the painting's authenticity and provenance were confirmed after scientific analysis. It said microscopic examination of the paint layers revealed not only white, black, and red pigments in the areas representing flesh, but also blue and green pigments Rubens typically used in painting human skin.",
      "Art expert Eric Turquin told a packed house the painting had virtually disappeared in the early 1600s. It is known to have belonged to 19th-century French classic painter William Bouguereau before it was passed down in the family.",
      "Although Rubens produced many works for the Church, the painting, measuring 42 by 29 inches, was likely to have been created for a private collector.",

    "published": "Sun, 07 Dec 2025 07:00:15 -0500",
    "summary": "President Trump's efforts to reshape the executive branch and flex his presidential power are set to be tested at the Supreme Court on Monday.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump's efforts to reshape the executive branch and flex his presidential power are set to be tested at the Supreme Court on Monday, when the justices convene to hear a case that could lead to the dismantling of protections meant to insulate independent agencies from political pressure.",
      "The case, known as Trump v. Slaughter, arose from Mr. Trump's move to fire Rebecca Kelly Slaughter from her post at the Federal Trade Commission without cause, despite a federal statute that limits a commissioner's removal to instances of inefficiency, neglect of duty or malfeasance in office.",
      "Now, the high court is set to decide whether those removal protections for members of the FTC violate the separation of powers, and whether it should overturn a landmark 1935 decision in a case called Humphrey's Executor v. United States.",
      "The legal battle is the culmination of a yearslong weakening of Humphrey's Executor by the court's conservative justices. In that 90-year-old ruling, which involved President Franklin Roosevelt's attempt to remove a member of the Federal Trade Commission, the high court allowed Congress to shield certain independent agency members from being removed by the president at will.",
      "But in several recent decisions, the conservative justices have chipped away at the precedent. Most recently, it ended removal protections for officials at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau in 2020 and the Federal Housing Finance Agency in 2021.",
      "Since Mr. Trump returned to the White House for a second term, he has sought to expand the bounds of presidential power and moved to fire a swath of Democratic-appointed members of independent boards and commissions.",
      "Trump's firing of Slaughter",
      "Slaughter was among the victims of the president's campaign to \"reclaim power from this unaccountable bureaucracy.\" Appointed to the FTC by Mr. Trump in his first term and reappointed by Biden, she received an email in March with a message from the president informing her that her \"continued service on the FTC is inconsistent with my Administration's priorities.\"",
      "The president's move to fire Slaughter and a fellow Democratic commissioner, Alvaro M. Bedoya, left the FTC with only three commissioners, who were all Republicans.",
      "Slaughter, like many other independent agency leaders fired by Mr. Trump, sued to get her job back and argued that her removal was illegal. When Congress established the FTC in 1914, it said commissioners could be removed by the president only for inefficiency, neglect of duty or malfeasance in office. But Mr. Trump had not followed the law, she argued.",
      "A federal district court ruled in her favor, finding that Slaughter's removal was unlawful. It ordered her to be reinstated to her job at the FTC. But that decision was the first in a series of re-hirings and re-firings. Days after Slaughter prevailed before the district court, the U.S. appeals court in Washington, D.C., issued a temporary order allowing her removal. Weeks after that, the appeals court said Slaughter should be reinstated once again.",
      "Then, when the Trump administration sought emergency relief from the Supreme Court, Chief Justice John Roberts cleared the way for her firing. The high court agreed in late September to hear the case and continued to keep her out of her post while it considers whether the removal protections for members of the trade commission violate the separation of powers.",
      "What's at stake",
      "That issue, and the fate of its 1935 precedent, will be before the high court Monday, when the justices convene for arguments.",
      "\"It's very likely the Supreme Court is going to say that in order for the president to be able to do his job, to take care that the laws are faithfully executed, he has to have control of the people helping him execute those laws,\" said Brian Fitzpatrick, a professor at Vanderbilt University Law School.",
      "The Supreme Court's decision could have significant ramifications for the structure of the federal government and curtail Congress' power to impose limits on the president's removal power.",
      "\"The president is supposed to have certain powers that are separated from the legislative branch, and if the legislative branch goes in there and says we're going to interfere with your powers by saying you're not allowed to remove these people, that's a violation of the separation of powers,\" Fitzpatrick said.",
      "The Trump administration argued that the Constitution vests all executive power in the president and therefore grants him \"illimitable\" authority over officers who wield that power on his behalf. In a filing with the Supreme Court, Solicitor General D. John Sauer said that removal protections for members of independent agencies leave the president \"saddled with subordinate officers\" who prevent him from ensuring that the laws are faithfully executed.",
      "While Congress' power to structure the executive branch allows it to establish and organize departments under the president, it does not allow lawmakers \"to establish a Fourth Branch that siphons executive power away from the chief executive's control,\" Sauer wrote.",
      "Congress has created more than two dozen independent agencies that regulate many aspects of American life, from nuclear waste to telemarketing to consumer products, with removal protections that seek to shield their members from political pressure.",
      "In its 1935 decision in Humphrey's Executor, the Supreme Court recognized an exception to the president's removal power for multi-member agencies with quasi-legislative or quasi-judicial powers. The high court found that the FTC fit within those parameters, and its commissioners could therefore only be removed for cause.",
      "But the Trump administration argued that the trade commission of today is different from the agency of 90 years ago because it has amassed executive powers. The modern FTC executes more than 80 federal laws and regulates a broad range of matters, from meat products to contact lenses to credit cards, Sauer wrote.",
      "Additionally, the FTC can now file civil suits seeking monetary penalties, make substantive rules, issue final orders in agency adjudications and investigate potential violations, he said.",
      "\"The notion that some agencies that exercise executive power can be sequestered from presidential control seriously offends the Constitution's structure and the liberties that the separation of powers protects,\" Sauer wrote.",
      "Impacts of the court's decision",
      "If the Supreme Court invalidates the removal protections for FTC commissioners, such a decision is likely to reach far beyond the commission.",
      "Because many statutes restrict a president to removing an official for inefficiency, neglect of duty and malfeasance in office, Fitzpatrick predicted the high court will \"say those words are an unconstitutional restriction on the president so all the other agencies with those words will be in the same boat.\"",
      "Lawyers for Slaughter, meanwhile, warned of the broad impacts of a decision overturning the Supreme Court's 1935 decision, writing in a filing that doing so would destabilize institutions that have been woven into the fabric of U.S. governance.",
      "\"Multimember independent agencies are deeply ingrained in our Nation's history and tradition, from the First Congress to the present day,\" they said. \"That history confirms that they are fully compatible with our Constitution's text and structure.\"",
      "Slaughter's legal team argued that the Trump administration is asking the Supreme Court to transfer new powers to the president that Congress chose not to give him and wants courts to \"jettison longstanding laws enacted by the people's elected representatives.\"",
      "They also said the current structure of multimember independent agencies \u2014 composed of members from both parties who serve for staggered terms and are insulated from political shifts \u2014 leads to \"more modest actions\" and therefore protects individual liberty better than an agency helmed by a single person.",
      "\"What the statutory protection for a member's tenure guarantees is that a political minority, the minority party, will always be represented in deliberations, which is at the very least an important watchdog function,\" said Peter Shane, a legal scholar at New York University School of Law.",
      "He continued: \"But the other thing is it prevents presidents from sabotaging agencies and sabotaging the congressional design, either by eliminating from the agency members of the minority party, or enough members so that an agency lacks a quorum to function at all.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has already attempted to make his mark on the Merit Systems Protection Board, which protects the rights of government workers. The president fired one of its members, Cathy Harris, in February, leaving the MSPB without a quorum between April and October.",
      "\"A president opposed to the statutory mission of an agency can entirely kneecap it by depriving it of a quorum, and the president can certainly deprive it of genuine bipartisanship by refusing to fill the seats that would belong to the minority party,\" Shane said. \"The minority signaling function is quite important and it has multiple audiences, including the majority on a particular commission. But it also includes journalists, the general public and the courts.\"",
      "Slaughter's lawyers argued that even with protections in place for leaders of independent agencies, presidents can still exert influence over them through the candidates they nominate and the chair they select, as well as through recommending or vetoing spending bills that affect agency operations.",
      "A key issue for the court will be how it characterizes the powers that an agency wields. When the Supreme Court earlier this year allowed Mr. Trump to fire members of the National Labor Relations Board and the MSPB, it suggested in an unsigned order that the agencies \"exercise considerable executive power.\" A divided panel of three judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit ruled Friday that removal protections for the two labor boards are unconstitutional and said Congress cannot restrict the president's ability to remove their members.",
      "Mr. Trump has also\u00a0attempted to fire\u00a0a member of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, Lisa Cook. But the Supreme Court has so far allowed her to remain in her role, and the justices will\u00a0hear arguments on the case next month.",
      "\"All the agencies these days have a lot of powers, adjudicatory powers, rule-making powers, enforcement powers,\" Fitzpatrick said. \"I suspect no matter how they do it, all the independent agencies with the exception of the Fed are going to be under the president's thumb.\"",
      "But more than 200 members of Congress argued that multimember boards that are protected from at-will removal represent a longstanding compromise between the legislative and executive branches that should not be upset by the judicial branch. Invalidating for-cause removal protections would have drastic consequences for the structure and operation of the federal government, they wrote in a friend-of-the-court brief.",
      "\"[A]t-will removals of commissioners of independent agencies would lead regulated entities and the public to believe that the President is able to pick winners and losers in the American economy through intervening in individual cases,\" they said. \"That would detrimentally alter the way the public interacts with these regulators, and, consequently, the economic choices the regulators make.\"",

    "story": [
      "President Trump on Saturday presented the 2025 Kennedy Center honorees with their medals during a ceremony in the Oval Office, hailing the slate of artists he was deeply involved in choosing as \"perhaps the most accomplished and renowned class\" ever assembled.",
      "This year's recipients are actor Sylvester Stallone, singers Gloria Gaynor and George Strait, the rock band Kiss and actor-singer Michael Crawford.",
      "Mr. Trump said they are a group of \"incredible people\" who represent the \"very best in American arts and culture\" and that, \"I know most of them and I've been a fan of all of them.\"",
      "\"This is a group of icons whose work and accomplishments have inspired, uplifted and unified millions and millions of Americans,\" said a tuxedo-clad Mr. Trump. \"This is perhaps the most accomplished and renowned class of Kennedy Center Honorees ever assembled.\"",
      "Mr. Trump ignored the Kennedy Center and its premier awards program during his first term as president. But the Republican has instituted a series of changes\u00a0since returning to office in January, most notably ousting its board of trustees and replacing them with GOP supporters who voted him in as chair of the board. That triggered a number of artists to\u00a0cancel performances and some staff members resigned.",
      "The changes were instituted after the White House\u00a0accused the institution\u00a0of being \"woke\" and scrutinized its finances earlier this year.",
      "The president placed around each honoree's neck a new medal that was designed, created and donated by jeweler Tiffany & Co., according to the Kennedy Center and Mr. Trump.",
      "It's a gold disc etched on one side with the Kennedy Center's image and rainbow colors. The honoree's name appears on the reverse side with the date of the ceremony. The medallion hangs from a navy blue ribbon and replaces a large rainbow ribbon decorated with three gold plates that rested on the honoree's shoulders and chest.",
      "Strait, wearing a cowboy hat, was first to receive his medal. When the country singer started to take off the hat, Mr. Trump said, \"If you want to leave it on, you can. I think we can get it through.\" But Strait took it off.",
      "The president said Crawford was a \"great star of Broadway\" for his lead role in the long-running \"Phantom of the Opera.\" Of Gaynor, he said, \"We have the disco queen, and she was indeed, and nobody did it like Gloria Gaynor.\"",
      "Mr. Trump was effusive about his friend Stallone, calling him a \"wonderful\" and \"spectacular\" person and \"one of the true, great movie stars\" and \"one of the great legends.\"",
      "Kiss is an \"incredible rock band,\" he said.",
      "Songs by honorees Gaynor and Kiss played in the Rose Garden just outside the Oval Office as members of the White House press corps waited nearby for Mr. Trump to begin the ceremony.",
      "The president said in August that he was \"about 98% involved\" in choosing the 2025 honorees when he personally announced them at the Kennedy Center, the first slate chosen under his leadership. The honorees traditionally had been announced by press release.",
      "It was unclear how they were chosen. Before Mr. Trump, it fell to a bipartisan selection committee.",
      "\"These are among the greatest artists, actors and performers of their generation. The greatest that we've seen,\" Mr. Trump said. \"We can hardly imagine the country music phenomena without its king of country, or American disco without its first lady, or Broadway without its phantom \u2014 and that was a phantom, let me tell you \u2014 or rock and roll without its hottest band in the world, and that's what they are, or Hollywood without one of its greatest visionaries.\"",
      "\"Each of you has made an indelible mark on American life and together you have defined entire genres and set new standards for the performing arts,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "Mr. Trump was also attending an annual State Department dinner for the honorees on Saturday. In years past, the honorees received their medallions there but Trump moved the ceremony to the White House.",
      "Meanwhile, the glitzy Kennedy Center Honors program and its series of tribute speeches and performances for each recipient is set to be taped on Sunday at the performing arts center for broadcast later in December on CBS and Paramount+. Mr. Trump is to attend the program for the first time as president, accompanied by his wife, first lady Melania Trump.",
      "The president said in August that he had agreed to host the show, and he seemed to confirm on Saturday that he would do so, predicting that the broadcast would garner its highest ratings ever as a result. Presidents traditionally attend the program and sit with the honorees in the audience. None has ever served as host.",
      "He said he looked forward to Sunday's celebration.",
      "\"It's going to be something that I believe, and I'm going to make a prediction: this will be the highest-rated show that they've ever done and they've gotten some pretty good ratings, but there's nothing like what's going to happen tomorrow night,\" Mr. Trump said.",

    "story": [
      "Ahead of Sunday's announcement of the 2026 Baseball Hall of Fame's Contemporary Era Class, President Trump on Saturday called on the committee to admit pitcher Roger Clemens, who is one of eight players on the ballot.",
      "In a lengthy Truth Social post, the president argued that the committee \"should do the right thing by finally putting Roger Clemens, known as 'The Rocket,' in the Hall!,\" adding that Clemens is \"clearly one of the Greatest Pitchers of All Time.\"",
      "The president noted Clemens' 354 career wins, ninth all-time in Major League Baseball history, and his seven Cy Young awards, an annual achievement given out to the best pitchers in the American and National leagues. He also had 4,672 strikeouts, third all-time behind Nolan Ryan (5,714) and Randy Johnson (4,875).",
      "The 63-year-old Clemens has been accused of using performance-enhancing drugs, which he has denied. In June of 2012, following a 10-week trial,\u00a0a federal jury found Clemens not guilty\u00a0of charges that he obstructed and lied to Congress in denying he had used PEDs.",
      "\"The only reason he is not is because of rumors and innuendo, which were not proven,\" Mr. Trump wrote. \"He never tested positive and, when the Obama DOJ went after him in a criminal case claiming that he did take steroids, Roger, who has always denied taking any drugs, was FULLY ACQUITTED OF ALL CHARGES.\"",
      "Clemens was charged over a deposition and congressional testimony he gave in February 2008 in a nationally televised hearing. The charges centered on his repeated denials that he used steroids and human growth hormone during a 24-year career.",
      "In that 2008 hearing, Clemens told Congress that \"no matter what we discuss here today, I'm never going to have my name restored.\"",
      "He was denied election to the Hall for 10 straight years by the Baseball Writers' Association of America, with his final ballot appearance coming in 2022, his last year of eligibility under the traditional rules.",
      "However, they are now in the Contemporary Baseball Era player ballot, which according to the Hall \"features candidates whose primary contribution to the game came since 1980.\"",
      "The Hall in 2022 restructured its veterans committees for the third time in 12 years, setting up panels to consider the contemporary era from 1980 on as well as the classic era. The contemporary baseball era holds separate ballots for players and another for managers, executives and umpires.",
      "Each committee meets every three years. Contemporary managers, executives and umpires will be considered in December 2026, classic era candidates in December 2027 and contemporary era players again in December 2028.",
      "The contemporary committee features 16 members, including Hall of Fame players Ferguson Jenkins, Jim Kaat, Juan Marichal, Tony P\u00e9rez, Ozzie Smith, Alan Trammell and Robin Yount. They will be joined by former major league general managers Kim Ng, Doug Melvin, Tony Reagins and Terry Ryan, and media members Tyler Kepner and Jayson Stark of The Athletic and historian Steve Hirdt, the Hall said Tuesday.",
      "Owners Mark Attanasio of the Milwaukee Brewers and Arte Moreno of the Los Angeles Angels also are on the committee that gathers Sunday at the winter meetings in Orlando, Florida.",
      "Each voter can select up to three candidates, and 75% or more of ballots are needed for election. Anyone chosen will be inducted into the Hall of Fame on July 26 along with players voted in by the Baseball Writers' Association of America, whose balloting will be announced on Jan. 20.",
      "Under a change announced by the Hall last March, any candidate on the ballot who receives fewer than five votes will not be eligible for that committee's ballot during the next three-year cycle. A candidate who is dropped, later reappears on a ballot and again receives fewer than five votes would be barred from future ballot appearances.",

      "Washington \u2014 The man suspected of planting pipe bombs outside the Republican National Committee and Democratic National Committee headquarters on Jan. 5, 2021, is believed to be a supporter of President Trump and has been speaking with investigators, multiple sources told CBS News.",
      "The suspect, 30-year-old Brian Cole Jr., was arrested Thursday in Virginia and appeared at an initial hearing Friday in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. He faces two charges related to a pair of explosive devices that were left outside the parties' headquarters on the night before the Jan. 6 assault on the U.S. Capitol. The devices did not explode.",
      "Investigators have not revealed a potential motive. Two law enforcement sources said on Friday that Cole is believed to be a supporter of the president. Two other sources said Cole has been speaking with investigators since his arrest.",
      "Cole appeared in court wearing a khaki-green short-sleeve jumpsuit. He was represented by a private attorney, John Shoreman.",
      "Magistrate Judge Moxila Upadhyaya presided over the hearing and read the charges: attempted malicious destruction by fire and explosives, and transporting an explosive device across state lines. Cole did not enter a plea.",
      "Six family members were in the courtroom, and several said \"I love you\" as Cole exited. Shoreman, on behalf of the family, declined to comment. Cole's next court appearance is scheduled for Dec. 15.",
      "The pipe bombs were discovered the afternoon of Jan. 6, when a mob of Mr. Trump's supporters breached the building, overwhelming nearby law enforcement. An affidavit from an unidentified FBI agent filed in support of the charges against Cole did not mention the Capitol attack.",
      "The devices did not detonate, but the FBI said they were viable and \"could have seriously injured or killed innocent bystanders.\" The bureau said last year that the suspect \"may still pose a danger to the public or themselves\" and offered a $500,000 reward for information leading to the suspect's arrest and conviction.",
      "The case had vexed the FBI for years. Investigators initially released footage of a potential suspect and details about the Nike shoes he was wearing when the bombs were planted, but made little apparent progress in cracking the case.",
      "According to the affidavit, cellphone records show that Cole's phone was located in the vicinity of the DNC and RNC headquarters on Jan. 5, when the person who planted the bombs was seen on surveillance footage. Cole's car was also spotted by a license plate reader less than half a mile from where the person was seen on the footage, the document states. Investigators said they have records of him buying components that were used to make the explosives.",
      "During a press conference Thursday announcing the arrest, Attorney General Pam Bondi declined to provide details about Cole's potential motive. Bondi told reporters no new tip or witness emerged that led to the arrest and that the development was the result of going over evidence that was already in the FBI's possession.",
      "\"Today's arrest happened because the Trump administration has made this case a priority,\" Bondi said. \"The total lack of movement on this case in our nation's capital undermined the public trust of our enforcement agencies.\"",

      "Two people who survived an early September U.S. attack on an alleged drug boat in the Caribbean were waving overhead before they were killed in a now-controversial second strike, according to two sources familiar with a video that was shown to lawmakers this week.",
      "One of the sources said the action could be interpreted as the survivors either calling for help or trying to wave off another strike.",
      "The additional details were first reported by The New York Times.",
      "The Sept. 2 operation was the first of more than 20 attacks on alleged drug-carrying vessels by the Trump administration in recent months \u2014 a campaign that officials argue is necessary to stem narcotics trafficking, but critics believe is legally unjustified. More than 80 people have been killed in the strikes, including 11 people on Sept. 2, the military has said.",
      "The operation has drawn fresh scrutiny since a report last week that the U.S. military carried out a follow-up strike on the vessel, killing two people who survived the initial attack. Some Democrats and legal experts have argued a strike to kill shipwrecked survivors could constitute a war crime. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt has confirmed there was a second strike, but argued it was lawful and warranted to \"ensure the boat was destroyed.\"",
      "Members of Congress watched a video of the strikes \u2014 including the strike that killed the two survivors \u2014 during closed-door testimony on Thursday with the operation's commander, Adm. Mitch Bradley, and Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Gen. Dan Caine.",
      "But lawmakers offered starkly differing interpretations of the video after the hearing.",
      "Democratic Rep. Jim Himes of Connecticut told reporters the survivors appeared to be \"in clear distress without any means of locomotion,\" calling it \"one of the most troubling things I've seen in my time in public service.\" Republican Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas said the survivors were \"trying to flip a boat loaded with drugs bound for the United States back over so they could stay in the fight,\" concluding the four strikes on Sept. 2 were \"entirely lawful and needful.\"",
      "Multiple lawmakers said Bradley testified that there was no order from Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to kill everybody onboard.",
      "President Trump said Wednesday he would support releasing a video of the strikes to the public. When asked by a reporter if he would support killing survivors, the president responded: \"No, I support the decision to knock out the boats.\"",

One provision that drew heavy pushback from U.S. and European officials called for Ukraine to cede territory it currently controls in Donetsk to Russia.",

      "Zelenskyy, as well as European leaders backing him, have repeatedly accused Putin of stalling in peace talks while the Russian army tries to press forward with its invasion. Zelenskyy said in a video address late Thursday that officials wanted to know \"what other pretexts Putin has come up with to drag out the war and to pressure Ukraine.\"",
      "Speaking to Russian journalist Pavel Zarubin on Friday, Ushakov praised Kushner as potentially playing an important role in ending Russia's invasion of Ukraine.",
      "\"If any plan leading to a settlement is put on paper, it will be the pen of Mr. Kushner that will lead the way,\" Ushakov said.",
      "The flattering comments about Kushner by the senior Russian official come as Putin has sought to sow division between Mr. Trump and Ukraine and Europe at a moment when Mr. Trump's impatience with the conflict is mounting. Putin, who made a state visit to India on Thursday, told an Indian media outlet that his five-hour talks this week with Witkoff and Kushner were \"necessary\" and \"useful,\" but some proposals were unacceptable.",
      "Kushner, who is married to Mr. Trump's daughter Ivanka, was a senior adviser to Mr. Trump during his first term and was the president's point person on developing the Abraham Accords, which formalized commercial and diplomatic ties between Israel and a trio of Arab nations.",

    "published": "Fri, 05 Dec 2025 19:49:16 -0500",
    "summary": "President Trump has led the charge to create more GOP-friendly congressional districts in the 2026 midterm elections.",
    "story": [
      "Indiana's state House on Friday passed a new congressional map that aims to make all nine of the state's U.S. House districts friendly to Republicans, after months of contentious debate and pressure from the Trump administration.",
      "The bill passed in a 57-41 vote and now heads to the GOP-controlled state Senate, which is reconvening on Dec. 8. A number of vocal Republicans in the Indiana Senate have held out against redistricting, although it's unclear if they are enough to prevent it from passing.",
      "President Trump congratulated members of the state House for passing the new map later Friday, and urged the Senate to take up the matter as soon as possible. He listed out nine state senators who he said \"need encouragement to make the right decision\" in a Truth Social post.",
      "On Wednesday, state Sen. Kyle Walker, one of the GOP holdouts, announced he would not be seeking reelection. Two other Republicans in the chamber who are not seeking reelection, Sens. Eric Bassler and Greg Walker, have also said they are opposed to redistricting.",
      "The contentious process among Indiana legislators had led to numerous bomb threats and swatting incidents against officials, state police said.",
      "Republican state Sen. Jean Leising, who opposed the redistricting effort in the state, said in a social media post Sunday that she was the target of a pipe bomb threat. She called the threat the \"result of the D.C. political pundits for redistricting,\" and added, \"I will not cave.\"",
      "The measure moved forward Monday through the Indiana House elections committee, with one Republican joining all four Democrats on the committee in opposition. Eight Republicans voted in favor.",
      "For months, the White House had been pushing Indiana, a state that Mr. Trump won by 19 points, to redraw its congressional map to try to edge out the two Democrats in the U.S. House. Mr. Trump, Vice President JD Vance and other members of the administration met several times with Indiana Republicans to persuade them to redraw the map.",
      "Indiana Gov. Mike Braun called the legislature to reconvene for a special session in November to consider redistricting. But Senate President Rodric Bray insisted that the votes weren't there, and when the legislature convened, they simply agreed to meet again in January for the regular session.",
      "Before announcing that lawmakers would convene after all, Bray acknowledged in November that \"the issue of redrawing Indiana's congressional maps mid-cycle has received a lot of attention and is causing strife here in our state.\"",
      "Mr. Trump and his allies stepped up threats on Republican holdouts in the legislature, with Mr. Trump calling some out by name on social media and promising they'd face primaries.",
      "Republicans and Democrats across the country have been scrambling to undertake mid-decade redistricting, a practice that was rarely undertaken until this year. With the GOP holding a slim majority in the U.S. House and facing down a historical trend that midterm elections tend to favor the party opposing the president, Mr. Trump first turned to Texas. There was historical precedent: Texas conducted mid-decade redistricting during the Bush administration, which was upheld by the Supreme Court in 2005.",
      "Texas' GOP-led legislature reconvened in the summer to redraw the state's maps to net up to five seats for Republicans. In response, California Gov. Gavin Newsom pushed forward with a ballot measure known as Proposition 50 to redistrict his state to net up to five seats for Democrats, since California requires voter approval of its congressional map. Prop 50 passed on Election Day with more than 64% of the vote.",
      "Missouri and North Carolina's Republican legislatures have redrawn their maps in an attempt to gain a new seat in each state for Republicans. Meanwhile, Maryland Democrats have suggested they could undertake a similar effort to edge out the state's one Republican House member, though the idea has faced resistance from some Democratic legislators.",
      "The redistricting campaigns have drawn lawsuits in some states. The Supreme Court on Thursday allowed Texas to use its newly drawn congressional map for now, halting a lower court ruling that found the new map was racially gerrymandered.",
      "Supreme Court allows Texas GOP to use new redistricted map for now\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTexas representatives react to U.S. Supreme court allowing use of new maps in redistricting battle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCongressional watchdog opens probe into Trump housing finance head Bill Pulte\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMichigan bill would allow tech to monitor drones around state buildings\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeorgia ethics panel decides Burt Jones can loan $10M to his campaign",

    "summary": "The final report this week from the special inspector general for Afghanistan identified $26 billion in waste, fraud, and abuse in U.S. reconstruction spending in Afghanistan since 2009.",
    "story": [
      "Congress appropriated about $144.7 billion for Afghanistan reconstruction from 2002 to 2021, but the U.S. failed to transform the country into a democracy, in part because of corrupt allies and the lack of a clear plan, according to the final report from the special inspector general for Afghanistan reconstruction, or SIGAR.",
      "The report, released earlier this week, is a collection of the inspector general's previous work, which taken together, \"highlights serious systemic issues with reconstruction and paints a picture of a two-decade long effort fraught with waste,\" acting inspector general Gene Aloise wrote at the beginning of the report.",
      "\"We were seeing what was happening all along. This was not what winning looked like,\" Aloise told reporters at a session of the Defense Writers Group earlier this week.",
      "\"The biggest thing throughout the whole 20 years was corruption affected everything,\" Aloise said, describing Afghanistan's government as \"essentially a white-collar criminal enterprise.\"",
      "He told reporters that since about 2012, the inspector general's quarterly reports showed systemic weaknesses, especially regarding the Afghan National Security and Defense Forces, but more and more, the U.S. government wanted to classify sections of the reports.",
      "\"There were a lot of people on the Hill who were concerned, but every time we came out with some of these statistics, we were slapped down, and they were classified,\" Aloise said.",
      "The report does not specifically look at the withdrawal in 2021 but does give an estimate of what the U.S. left behind. The U.S. left about $38.6 billion behind in military equipment and infrastructure built by the U.S.",
      "SIGAR has not been contacted for any contribution to the Pentagon's current review of the withdrawal, ordered in May by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, according to Aloise.",
      "Aloise told reporters that after the withdrawal, the Biden administration stonewalled his office for about a year, claiming SIGAR's jurisdiction ended when the troops left Afghanistan, even though there was still money flowing to the country. It took pressure from Congress for the Biden administration, mostly the State Department and USAID, to resume cooperation.",
      "SIGAR was established in 2008 by Congress and will close Jan. 31. Over the course of its reports and investigations, it generated more than $4.6 billion in cost savings for the taxpayer and identified at least $26 billion in waste, fraud, and abuse.",
      "Aloise told reporters the losses could've been much higher, had the inspector general's office not existed.",
      "\"The deterrent effect of SIGAR was huge,\" Aloise said. \"We just keep thinking \u2013 if we're going into Gaza or we're going into Ukraine, and you don't have something like a SIGAR, you know, it's, it's not gonna work out well \u2013 for at least the United States taxpayer.\"",

    "summary": "ICE began enhanced operations in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area this week, as President Trump rails against Somali people in Minnesota.",
    "story": [
      "Federal immigration authorities this week began conducting enhanced operations in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area, a U.S. official told CBS News, targeting a region with a large population of the Somali immigrants President Trump often rails against.",
      "The surge by Immigration and Customs Enforcement is expected to target individuals in the Twin Cities area with deportation orders, the official said. The exact scope and duration of the operation are not clear so far.",
      "Late Thursday, ICE released a list of 12 people who have been arrested since Monday, describing them in a news release as \"some of the worst of the worst criminal illegal aliens\" detained in the Twin Cities operation. Half of the arrestees were from Mexico, five were from Somalia and one was from El Salvador, the agency said. Just over half had criminal convictions, and the rest had arrests or charges, according to ICE.",
      "The crackdown comes as Mr. Trump castigates Minnesota's large community of Somali immigrants, regularly pointing to the country \u2014 often in incendiary terms \u2014 as a justification for his administration's sweeping mass deportation campaign.",
      "During a Cabinet meeting Tuesday, Mr. Trump called people from Somalia \"garbage\" and claimed they \"contribute nothing.\"",
      "\"I don't want them in our country. I'll be honest with you,\" the president said Tuesday. \"Their country's no good for a reason. Their country stinks.\"",
      "In recent days, the Trump administration has halted all immigration cases, including citizenship ceremonies, for people from Somalia and 18 other nations on its travel ban, and has ordered a reexamination of all green cards issued to immigrants from those countries, CBS News has reported.",
      "And last month, Mr. Trump said he was ending a deportation protection program called Temporary Protected Status for Somali immigrants in Minnesota, claiming without evidence that \"Somali gangs are terrorizing the people.\" The TPS program for Somalia is set to expire in March 2026, though the Department of Homeland Security has not formally announced its termination.",
      "Mr. Trump has also brought attention to a massive public assistance fraud scandal that has dogged Minnesota politics for years, in which dozens of defendants \u2014 most of whom are of Somali descent \u2014 were accused of bilking hundreds of millions of dollars from food aid, autism services and housing programs. The president has blamed Democratic Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz for the fraud schemes and claimed Somali immigrants have \"ripped off that state.\"",
      "Democratic officials and members of Minnesota's Somali community have denounced Mr. Trump's statements, with Walz on Thursday calling them \"vile, racist lies and slander towards our fellow Minnesotans.\"",
      "\"I am not garbage,\" Hamse Warfa, a Somali-born entrepreneur who lives in the Minneapolis area and runs a nationwide education nonprofit, told CBS News Minnesota. \"I'm a proud American citizen.\"",
      "Minnesota has one of the country's largest Somali populations, with some 76,000 people of Somali descent statewide \u2014 representing just over 1% of the state's population, according to 2024 data from the U.S. Census Bureau.",
      "The state's Somali community grew after the East African country descended into civil war in the early 1990s, causing scores of people to flee Somalia, which still faces instability, threats of insurgency and poverty.",
      "In some cases, Somali refugees were resettled elsewhere in the U.S. before moving to Minnesota, drawn in many cases by job opportunities, safety, good schools and a longstanding network of nonprofits in the state that assist refugees, Somali American and Macalester College professor Ahmed Samatar told CBS News Minnesota in 2019. Just over half of Somali Minnesotans arrived in the U.S. before 2010, and one in five moved to the U.S. before 2000.",
      "As of last year, the vast majority of Somali Minnesotans were American citizens. Some 52% were born in the U.S., and another 42% are naturalized citizens, leaving just over 4,000 \u2014 or more than 5% \u2014 who don't hold U.S. citizenship, according to Census Bureau figures.",
      "From the start of Mr. Trump's second term in January to Oct. 15, ICE made 117 arrests of people with Somali citizenship nationwide, 28 of which were in Minnesota, according to figures from the Deportation Data Project. The agency made 1,694 total arrests in Minnesota over the same time period \u2014 around 1% of nationwide arrests.",
      "Mr. Trump's plan to end TPS for Somali immigrants could impact a very small number of people. Just over 700 immigrants from Somalia had been approved for TPS as of March of this year, according to federal government data. The Immigrant Law Center said Minnesota was home to 430 of those Somali TPS-holders in 2023.",

    "summary": "President Trump's claims of a historic multitrillion-dollar investment surge don't match federal data or the administration's own numbers.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump has made increasingly sweeping claims about new investments flowing into the United States, citing figures as high as $21 trillion since taking office.",
      "\"Twenty-one trillion dollars will be the amount invested in the United States \u2014\u00a0 or committed to invest \u2014 in one year,\" the president said in a November meeting with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.",
      "In an Oval Office event this Wednesday, President Trump said, \"In 10 months, we have $18 trillion being invested.\"",
      "But a CBS News review found no evidence that total commitments or new investments approach the scale the president has cited. While companies and foreign governments have announced large-scale projects since Mr. Trump's inauguration, the White House has not provided documentation showing total investments approaching $21 trillion \u2014 an amount roughly two-thirds of the annual GDP.",
      "The administration's own list of major investments \"made possible by President Trump's leadership\" totaled $9.6 trillion as of the latest update in November, but even that figure is exaggerated. It includes some investments announced under President Biden and trade goals that the U.S. is also partially responsible for.",
      "The White House did not directly respond to CBS News' questions about these inclusions or the discrepancies between the administration's total and the much higher figures the president has claimed in his remarks.",
      "\"President Trump's dealmaking has secured trillions in investments to make and hire in America, trillions in commercial opportunities for American companies, and trillions in new export opportunities,\" White House spokesman Kush Desai said in a statement.",
      "Federal data shows corporate investment levels are roughly in line with last year, with companies on track to invest over $5 trillion in 2025. The $20 trillion surge Mr. Trump has claimed does not appear in the available data.",
      "Here's a closer look at some of the investment claims.",
      "Trump claims credit for some corporate investments announced under Biden",
      "The White House list includes more than 100 corporate commitments totaling over $3 trillion. Yet some of the largest were originally unveiled years before Mr. Trump took office and were backed by federal funding under President Biden's administration.",
      "The administration lists a $200 billion investment by Micron Technology in semiconductor manufacturing and research. However, a company spokesman confirmed $120 billion of that was previously announced in 2022 and supported by $6 billion in funding from Biden's Chips and Science Act.",
      "Similarly, the White House attributes a $16 billion GlobalFoundries investment in U.S. chip production to Mr. Trump. However, only $3 billion is newly promised this year. A company spokesperson said the remaining $13 billion was originally announced under Biden and backed by tax credits from the Chips and Science Act.",
      "The Trump administration also claims credit for some major clean-energy manufacturing investments, even though its own policies have undercut projects in the sector, said Tom Taylor, a senior policy analyst at Atlas Public Policy, which tracks clean energy investment in the U.S.",
      "The administration cited Invenergy's $1.7 billion commitment to a clean-energy transmission project announced in May. In July, the U.S. Department of Energy canceled a $4.9 billion loan guarantee to Invenergy that had been issued under Biden. A spokesman for Invenergy said the company is continuing its transmission project with private financing, including the previously announced $1.7 billion investment.",
      "\"The administration has kind of been on a tear this year about canceling clean energy projects,\" Taylor said. His research shows the administration's funding cuts and policy shifts have halted over $20.8 billion in clean manufacturing investments this year.",
      "The White House list also contains apparent errors, including a $3 billion pledge by Kraft Heinz that appears twice. The administration has not responded to a CBS News request for clarification.",
      "Foreign trade goals and aspirational pledges inflate totals",
      "Foreign governments account for nearly $6 trillion on the White House's list, but several of the largest entries are trade targets \u2014 not investments in the U.S.",
      "For example, in a joint announcement, the U.S. and Qatar committed to \"generate an economic exchange worth at least $1.2 trillion,\" without specifying what portion Qatar would spend or when. The figure is also more than five times the gross domestic product of Qatar in 2024.",
      "Similarly, India and the U.S. agreed to \"more than double total bilateral trade to $500 billion by 2030\" \u2014 a trade target, not a singular investment commitment.",
      "Some foreign investment pledges touted by Mr. Trump also appear aspirational to some economists.",
      "Saudi Arabia promised to invest roughly $1 trillion in the U.S. during the crown prince's visit to the White House in November. But economists, including Maya Senussi at the Wall Street advisory firm Oxford Economics, have questioned\u202fwhether the oil-rich country could afford an investment that size with global energy prices declining.",
      "History also offers reason for skepticism: Mr. Trump touted in 2017 that Saudi Arabia had agreed to buy $400 billion in U.S. goods, but exports of American goods and services amounted to less than one-fourth of that total over his first term, according to analysis by the Arab Gulf States Institute in Washington.",
      "Current U.S. investment levels remain typical",
      "Federal data suggests that real investment spending \u2014 as opposed to announced commitments \u2014 remains roughly in line with last year's levels.",
      "Within the U.S., gross private domestic investment, the broadest measure of what U.S. companies are spending to expand their businesses, is projected to total about $5.4 trillion this year, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis, or BEA. That's up roughly $100 billion from the same point last year, but far below the multitrillion-dollar surge Mr. Trump has mentioned.",
      "\"Trump may be talking about commitments that have yet to happen. But on actual investment spending \u2014 so new equipment, buildings and machinery \u2014 2025 is similar to 2024,\" Nicholas Bloom, an economics professor at Stanford University, told CBS News in an email.",
      "Some research suggests that foreign corporations have sharply increased the number of spending pledges under Mr. Trump. They've promised to invest over $270 billion from January to October, more than double the volume announced under Biden in the same period, according to fDi intelligence, which is part of the Financial Times.",
      "But experts say announcements do not always translate into realized investment.",
      "New foreign direct investment \u2014 the actual amount that foreign companies put into U.S. subsidiaries and projects \u2014 also remains steady. Foreign companies made roughly $145 billion worth of new investment in the U.S. in the first half of the year, nearly identical to the $144 billion invested in the same time period last year, BEA data shows.",
      "Analysts at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, an independent think tank, estimate foreign investments will come in under $400 billion this year, well below record levels.",
      "\"He's got a lot more in terms of announcements and promises than any prior president. But how much does that really mean in terms of money coming in?\" said Gary Clyde Hufbauer, nonresident senior fellow at the Peterson Institute.",
      "This story has been updated with additional information from Invenergy.",

    "summary": "The Supreme Court said Friday it will decide the legality of President Trump's executive order that seeks to end birthright citizenship\u200b.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court said Friday it will decide the legality of President Trump's executive order that seeks to end birthright citizenship, which automatically grants citizenship to nearly everyone born in the U.S.",
      "Issued at the start of his second term, the plan is the first from Mr. Trump's immigration agenda that the Supreme Court will evaluate on the legal merits. The justices have been asked to intervene in several challenges to Mr. Trump's immigration policies, but did so at early stages of the cases and through emergency requests for relief.",
      "No lower court that has been confronted with legal challenges to the birthright citizenship order has embraced the Trump administration's interpretation of the 14th Amendment's Citizenship Clause. Still, the Justice Department has argued that those decisions are wrong, claiming that the Constitution does not grant citizenship to the children of \"temporary visitors or illegal aliens.\"",
      "Section 1 of the 14th Amendment states: \"All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.\"",
      "Cecillia Wang, national legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union, which is representing the plaintiffs in the case, said, \"No president can change the 14th Amendment's fundamental promise of citizenship.\"",
      "\"For over 150 years, it has been the law and our national tradition that everyone born on U.S. soil is a citizen from birth. The federal courts have unanimously held that President Trump's executive order is contrary to the Constitution, a Supreme Court decision from 1898, and a law enacted by Congress,\" Wang said in a statement. \"We look forward to putting this issue to rest once and for all in the Supreme Court this term.\"",
      "Mr. Trump issued his executive order on birthright citizenship on his first day back in the White House. Under the plan, children born in the U.S. to parents who are either in the country illegally or on a temporary basis are not recognized as U.S. citizens.",
      "The president's directive sought to reverse more than a century of understanding that the 14th Amendment grants citizenship to babies born on U.S. soil, with exceptions for children born to diplomats and foreign military forces. The Supreme Court addressed the issue 127 years ago, ruling in 1898 that the Citizenship Clause ties U.S. citizenship to place of birth.",
      "Mr. Trump's executive order is a pillar of his immigration agenda, but it has yet to take effect. The policy faced a slew of legal challenges soon after it was issued, and lower courts uniformly blocked its implementation. Then, the Supreme Court agreed to intervene during the early stages of three different cases, but did not consider the underlying legality of Mr. Trump's proposal.",
      "Instead, the issue before the justices was the scope of relief granted by lower courts hearing the birthright citizenship cases, which had issued nationwide injunctions preventing the administration from enforcing the policy. The Supreme Court, in a 6-3 decision, curtailed the ability of district court judges to issue those universal orders, but said plaintiffs could seek broad relief through class-action lawsuits. It also left open the possibility that states could secure nationwide relief.",
      "On the heels of that ruling, two babies subject to Mr. Trump's order and their parents, as well as a pregnant woman, filed a lawsuit challenging the birthright citizenship order on behalf of a putative nationwide class. A federal district court in New Hampshire certified as a provisional class all babies who would be denied birthright citizenship by the president's plan and found that the order likely violates the Constitution.",
      "The district court barred the Trump administration from enforcing the plan against all impacted by it.",
      "The Supreme Court is taking up the case before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 1st Circuit has weighed in.",
      "It did not act on another appeal involving four states, Washington, Arizona, Illinois and Oregon, that had been before the high court in a preliminary posture. In July, a three-judge panel on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit ruled that Mr. Trump's executive order was invalid because it contradicts the 14th Amendment's guarantee of citizenship to all born in the U.S.",
      "The 9th Circuit split 2-1 to leave in place a nationwide injunction that had been issued by a district court in February, finding it was necessary to give the states complete relief.",
      "The Justice Department urged the Supreme Court to take up both cases and issue a final decision on whether Mr. Trump's executive order is constitutionally sound. Solicitor General D. John Sauer said it's a \"mistaken view\" that birth on U.S. soil confers citizenship, and said that understanding has had \"destructive consequences.\"",
      "But the American Civil Liberties Union, which is representing the plaintiffs in the New Hampshire case, argued that the Trump administration is effectively asking the Supreme Court to \"rewrite\" the Citizenship Clause and unwind more than a century of the nation's \"everyday practice.\"",
      "Arguments in the case are expected to take place next year, with a decision likely issued by the end of June or early July.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal judge on Friday granted the Justice Department's request to unseal grand jury transcripts from a federal investigation in Florida into convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.",
      "The Justice Department had renewed its request for the material to be made public last month after Congress passed and President Trump signed a law\u00a0that requires the attorney general to disclose records related to the government's investigation into Epstein.",
      "U.S. District Judge Rodney Smith granted the request from Justice Department officials in a brief order.",
      "In its motion to the court last month, Attorney General Pam Bondi, Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche and other government lawyers wrote that the court should authorize the Justice Department to release the transcripts and lift any protective orders that would prevent disclosure to the public \"in light of the act's clear mandate.\"",
      "\"The Legislative and Executive Branches have nearly unanimously directed the Department of Justice to make records related to the Epstein and Maxwell investigations publicly available,\" they wrote.",
      "The Trump administration initially petitioned courts in Florida and New York in July to unseal grand jury materials after it faced backlash for a Justice Department memo that said any additional disclosure of information regarding Epstein was neither \"appropriate or warranted.\"",
      "The Justice Department said that a review of material related to Epstein conducted with the FBI concluded there was no \"client list\" or evidence that the late disgraced financier blackmailed prominent figures. Investigators also \"did not uncover evidence that could predicate any investigation against uncharged third parties,\" according to the memo.",
      "Judges in Florida and New York denied those initial bids for the information to be released to the public, since federal rules generally require grand jury proceedings to be kept secret.",
      "But the Trump administration tried again following Congress' passage of the Epstein Files Transparency Act, arguing that the law should override grand jury secrecy rules. It said that any victim-related and personal identifying information would be redacted from the grand jury transcripts if unsealed.",
      "Grand juries were convened in West Palm Beach in 2005 and 2007 to investigate Epstein. He ultimately evaded federal charges at the time through a deal with prosecutors that allowed him to plead guilty to state prostitution charges. In 2019, he was arrested on federal sex trafficking charges and died in custody.",
      "The material that Smith ordered to be unsealed is transcripts from those grand jury proceedings in Florida. It's unclear how quickly the information will be made public.",
      "Congress has separately been releasing information it has received through its own investigation into the federal government's handling of Epstein's case. It has made public a trove of emails and messages obtained from Epstein's estate, as well as photos and videos of his private island in the Caribbean.",
      "Democrats on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee said they have also received financial records related to Epstein from JPMorgan Chase and Deutsche Bank, which they plan to make public in the near future.",

    "published": "Thu, 04 Dec 2025 20:58:00 -0500",
    "summary": "President Trump has recently attacked Gov. Tim Walz over the fraud cases, calling Minnesota a \"hub of fraudulent money laundering activity\" and lashing out against the state's Somali community.",
    "story": [
      "A series of multimillion-dollar alleged fraud schemes in Minnesota has drawn the Trump administration's attention in recent weeks, vaulting an issue that has brewed in state politics for years into the national conversation.",
      "President Trump has called Minnesota a \"hub of fraudulent money laundering activity,\" and has lashed out against the state's Somali community as most of the fraud defendants were of Somali descent \u2014 drawing stiff criticism from local officials. This week, the administration launched enhanced immigration operations in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area.",
      "Meanwhile, U.S. House Republicans launched an investigation Wednesday into Democratic Gov. Tim Walz's handling of the fraud cases, and the U.S. Treasury said Monday it will look into whether tax dollars from Minnesota made their way to al Shabaab, a Somali-based al Qaeda affiliate. And federal prosecutors have continued to bring new charges against alleged fraudsters in the Midwestern state in recent months.",
      "Here's what to know about the cases:",
      "What was the Feeding Our Future fraud scheme?",
      "Three years ago, federal prosecutors in Minnesota filed the first charges in what they described as the \"largest pandemic fraud in the United States.\"",
      "The $250 million scheme \u2014 which now includes upward of 75 defendants \u2014 revolved around a nonprofit group called Feeding Our Future that partnered with the Minnesota Department of Education and U.S. Department of Agriculture to distribute meals to children.",
      "During the COVID-19 pandemic, prosecutors say, Feeding Our Future and its affiliated food distribution sites submitted fake meal count sheets and invoices to trick state and federal officials into thinking they had helped serve food to thousands of children. The group allegedly raked in millions in administrative fees for the fake meal distributions, and got kickbacks from people who ran their distribution sites, according to federal charging documents.",
      "Feeding Our Future's founder, Aimee Bock, was convicted at trial earlier this year. Several other defendants, including distribution site operators, have pleaded guilty or been convicted, in some cases receiving multiyear prison sentences and being ordered to pay millions in restitution. One defendant also pleaded guilty to attempting to bribe a juror, after a member of the jury in his fraud trial found a bag with $120,000 in cash at her home.",
      "Bock has long denied wrongdoing. At various points before charges were filed, Minnesota officials questioned some of the group's filings and slowed approvals of distribution sites, leading Feeding Our Future to file a lawsuit accusing the state of discrimination.",
      "The case was part of a trend of large-scale fraud across the U.S. during the pandemic, as the federal government poured money into assistance programs at a rapid clip. One former federal watchdog estimated to \"60 Minutes\" earlier this year that COVID-19 fraud may have cost taxpayers some $1 trillion.",
      "Prosecutors said the program that was allegedly co-opted by Feeding Our Future \u2014 the Federal Child Nutrition Program \u2014 became more vulnerable to fraud due to changes during the pandemic. Oversight was more difficult because of the health crisis, and federal officials waived some of the program's rules to let restaurants participate and allow off-site meal distribution.",
      "State officials have faced scrutiny for their handling of the situation. A probe last year by the state's Office of the Legislative Auditor found the Minnesota Department of Education \"created opportunities for fraud\" by failing to act on warning signs with Feeding Our Future or investigate complaints about the group.",
      "The report also found that officials felt they needed to handle Feeding Our Future carefully because the group had responded to a 2020 slowdown in food site approvals by accusing the Minnesota Department of Education of racial discrimination and of depriving needy children of food. In the Feeding Our Future's lawsuit against the state, it noted that it \"caters to members of a protected group of racial minorities and foreign nationals.\"",
      "The auditor's office said \"the threat of legal consequences and negative media attention affected MDE's decisions about the regulatory actions it did and did not take against Feeding Our Future.\"",
      "What other fraud allegations have circulated in Minnesota?",
      "The Feeding Our Future scheme isn't the only fraud case to rattle Minnesota politics.",
      "In August, state officials shut down a fairly new program designed to help seniors and people with disabilities find housing after discovering \"large-scale fraud.\"",
      "A month later, federal prosecutors charged eight people with allegedly defrauding the program, which was run through the state's Medicaid service, by enrolling as providers and submitting millions in \"fake and inflated bills.\"",
      "Prosecutors said the housing stabilization program was susceptible to fraud because it intentionally had \"low barriers to entry\" and few recordkeeping requirements. They also noted that spending on the program had ballooned to more than $100 million last year, despite initial estimates that it would cost around $2.6 million a year.",
      "And in late September, a person was charged with defrauding a third state program \u2014 in this case, one that provides services to children with autism. Her company was accused of hiring unqualified \"behavioral technicians\" and submitting false claims to the state that indicated the staff had worked with children enrolled in the program.",
      "She also allegedly paid kickbacks to parents who agreed to enroll their children in the program, in some cases sending them as much as $1,500, prosecutors said.",
      "The same person, Asha Farhan Hassan, was also charged in September with running a fraudulent food distribution site as part of the Feeding Our Future scheme.",
      "Acting U.S. Attorney Joseph H. Thompson said the case \"is not an isolated scheme.\"",
      "\"From Feeding Our Future to Housing Stabilization Services and now Autism Services, these massive fraud schemes form a web that has stolen billions of dollars in taxpayer money,\" the federal prosecutor wrote in a statement.",
      "Kelly Loeffler, who leads the U.S. Small Business Administration, also alleged Tuesday that some of the groups linked to the Feeding Our Future scheme received COVID-era emergency loans. She said she has ordered an \"investigation into the network of Somali organizations and executives implicated in these schemes.\" She did not provide details on the probe.",
      "What is the connection to Minnesota's Somali community?",
      "Most of the people charged in the Feeding Our Future case are of Somali descent, though Bock, the group's founder and the scheme's alleged \"mastermind,\" is White.",
      "Prosecutors in the alleged autism services fraud scheme said the defendant \"approached parents in the Somali community to recruit their children.\"",
      "The named fraud defendants appear to represent a small percentage of Minnesota's Somali American community, which is among the largest in the nation.",
      "Some 76,000 people of Somali descent live in the state, more than half of whom were born in the U.S., according to Census Bureau figures from last year. The vast majority of the state's foreign-born Somali population has U.S. citizenship, and most entered the U.S. before 2010.",
      "Around 65% of Somali people in Minnesota ages 16 and over were employed as of last year, according to the Census Bureau, roughly equivalent to the state population as a whole.",
      "Last year, a Somali American former investigator in the Minnesota attorney general's office, Kayseh Magan, wrote about what he called an \"uncomfortable and true\" reality that many people who have been charged with fraud in the state are of Somali descent.",
      "He wrote that \"fraud occurs when desire meets opportunity,\" noting that many Somali Americans are \"poor, desperate and seek shortcuts,\" and their families in the impoverished East African country frequently rely on money from their U.S.-based relatives. He said Somali service providers often leverage trust within the community to recruit friends and relatives into their programs. Many victims of these fraud schemes are Somali, too, he added.",
      "Has Minnesota taxpayer money made its way to the terror group al Shabaab?",
      "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said earlier this week that his department will investigate whether tax dollars from Minnesota's public assistance programs made their way to al Shabaab, an affiliate of al Qaeda and a U.S.-designated foreign terrorist organization based in Somalia.",
      "Bessent appeared to be responding to a report in the conservative magazine City Journal that alleged millions from state programs \"ultimately landed in the hands of the terror group Al-Shabaab,\" citing law enforcement sources.",
      "Those allegations have circulated for years. A 2019 report by the state's Office of the Legislative Auditor said it was \"unable to substantiate\" allegations that Child Care Assistance Program funding is going to terrorist groups, though the report didn't rule it out, saying it's \"possible\" that state funds may have been sent overseas and eventually found their way to terrorists.",
      "Multiple federal investigators told CBS News Minnesota's Jonah Kaplan that there is no evidence taxpayer dollars were funneled to al Shabaab.",
      "Andy Lugar, a Biden- and Obama-era U.S. attorney for Minnesota, told The Minnesota Star Tribune last month that those charged in the Feeding Our Future fraud scheme \"were looking to get rich, not fund overseas terrorism.\"",
      "What has President Trump said?",
      "Mr. Trump has blamed the fraud schemes on Somali people, whom he has attacked in often incendiary terms in recent weeks. On Tuesday, the president called immigrants from Somalia \"garbage,\" and claimed they \"destroyed Minnesota\" and \"contribute nothing.\"",
      "Last month, the president announced he would end temporary deportation protections for Somali immigrants who live in Minnesota, claiming without evidence that \"Somali gangs are terrorizing the people of that great State,\" and that Minnesota has become a \"hub of fraudulent money laundering activity.\"",
      "Somalia is also one of 19 countries that have faced near-total travel bans and a halt to immigration applications. And Immigration and Customs Enforcement operations are underway this week in the Minneapolis area, CBS News has reported.",
      "A particular focus of Mr. Trump's ire is Rep. Ilhan Omar, a Minnesota Democrat who was born in Somalia and came to the U.S. as a teenager. He has also lashed out at Walz, whom he referred to last week using a slur for people with intellectual disabilities.",
      "Minnesota lawmakers and members of the state's Somali community have castigated Mr. Trump for the comments. In an interview with \"Meet The Press\" last weekend, Walz said the fraud issue \"is totally disconnected with demonizing an entire group of people who came here, fleeing civil war, and created a vibrant community that makes Minnesota and this country better.\"",
      "What has Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz said about the fraud schemes?",
      "Walz, who has served as Minnesota's governor since 2019, told NBC's \"Meet The Press\" on Sunday that his state has sought to crack down on fraud. He also pointed to the state's generosity.",
      "\"Minnesota is a generous state. Minnesota is a prosperous state, a well-run state. We're AAA-bond rated,\" said the governor and 2024 Democratic vice presidential nominee. \"But that attracts criminals. Those people are going to jail. We're doing everything we can.\"",
      "Asked this week about the U.S. Treasury's investigation into claims that tax money may have gone to al Shabaab, Walz said the state welcomes federal help and wants to crack down on fraud, but added: \"I don't think anybody in here really believes their motive and their timing,\" referring to the Trump administration and congressional Republicans.",
      "Meanwhile, the governor and his administration have faced years of local scrutiny over their handling of fraud, dating back to the Feeding Our Future scheme's emergence in 2022. Republican officials have long argued the state failed to carry out due diligence and was slow to act in that scheme \u2014 though Walz has insisted the state caught the fraud early but was stymied by court battles and asked by the FBI not to cut off payments during its investigation.",
      "That scrutiny has resurged in recent weeks. Earlier Wednesday, Republican Rep. James Comer of Kentucky, the chair of the House Oversight Committee, opened an investigation into fraud in Minnesota's public assistance programs.",
      "\"The Committee has serious concerns about how you as the Governor, and the Democrat-controlled administration, allowed millions of dollars to be stolen,\" Comer said in a letter requesting documents from Walz. \"The Committee also has concerns that you and your administration were fully aware of this fraud and chose not to act for fear of political retaliation.\"",

    "published": "Thu, 04 Dec 2025 15:26:30 -0500",
    "summary": "The White House confirmed this week that there was a second strike, but denied that Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth ordered it.",
    "story": [
      "Two people who survived the U.S. military's early September strike on an alleged drug-carrying vessel were attempting to climb back onto the boat before it was hit a second time, a source familiar with the matter told CBS News on Wednesday.",
      "The survivors allegedly tried to salvage some of the drugs, according to the source. They appeared to be in communication with others at the time, and there were other boats in the vicinity that could have picked them up, the head of Special Operations Command Admiral Mitch Bradley was expected to tell lawmakers on Thursday, the source said.",
      "ABC News was first to report the additional details on the strike. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth reposted a video of ABC News' report on X.",
      "The Sept. 2 mission \u2014 the first of more than 20 attacks on alleged drug boats by the Trump administration in recent months \u2014 has drawn bipartisan scrutiny since last week, when The Washington Post reported that the military carried out at least two strikes on the same boat in the Caribbean, killing a pair of survivors from the initial hit. The newspaper alleged in its report that the second strike was conducted because Hegseth had said that everybody on board the boat should be killed.",
      "The White House confirmed this week that there was a second strike, but denied that Hegseth ordered it. Hegseth has said the decision was made by Bradley, the mission's commander, and argued the follow-up strike was legal and justified.",
      "Bradley and Gen. Dan Caine, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, walked lawmakers through a video of the second strike in classified testimony on Thursday before the House and Senate Armed Services and Intelligence committees. Bradley testified that Hegseth didn't issue an order for everybody to be killed, multiple lawmakers later told reporters.",
      "Members of Congress offered divergent views on the video. Democratic Rep. Jim Himes of Connecticut called it \"one of the most troubling things I've seen in my time in public service,\" describing the two survivors as people \"in clear distress\" who were \"not in the position to continue their mission in any way.\" But Republican Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas said he \"didn't see anything disturbing about it,\" adding the survivors appeared to be \"trying to flip a boat loaded with drugs bound for the United States back over so they could stay in the fight.\"",
      "Democrats and some legal experts have alleged the second strike may have constituted a war crime under U.S. and international law if the military targeted survivors.

    "title": "Trump thinks tariff revenue could replace income taxes. Is that possible?",
    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-cutting-income-tax-tariff-revenue/",
    "published": "Thu, 04 Dec 2025 15:14:11 -0500",
    "summary": "President Trump suggested Americans won't have to pay personal income taxes \"in the not-too-distant future\" because of rising U.S. tariffs.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump is floating an idea that could appeal to millions of budget-strained households: using tariff revenue to reduce, or even eliminate, the federal individual income tax. But tax experts are skeptical that import taxes could completely replace income tax, and they say a reduction in income taxes would largely benefit the nation's top earners.",
      "\"I believe that at some point in the not-too-distant future, you won't even have income tax to pay because the money we're taking in is so great,\" Mr. Trump said at a Dec. 2 Cabinet meeting, referring to the tariff revenues generated by the wide-ranging duties his administration has imposed on imports.",
      "Mr. Trump's suggestion comes as the Supreme Court is weighing the constitutionality of his tariffs, which are import taxes paid by U.S. companies that are typically passed partly on to American consumers in the form of higher prices. The Treasury Department this year has significantly boosted the country's collection of tariffs, thanks to Mr. Trump's policies.",
      "White House spokesman Kush Desai said in a statement that Mr. Trump \"is set to raise trillions in revenue for the federal government in the coming years with his tariffs \u2014 whose costs will ultimately be paid by the foreign exporters who rely on the American economy, the world's biggest and best consumer market.\"",
      "Despite the jump in tariff receipts, tax experts are skeptical that such revenue could ever replace individual income taxes.",
      "\"It is mechanically impossible to fully replace income tax revenues with tariffs,\" Erica York, vice president of federal tax policy at the Tax Foundation, a nonpartisan think tank, told CBS News. \"Any real attempt to do so would harm working-class Americans, damage the U.S. economy and significantly increase the federal budget deficit.\"",
      "York estimated the Trump administration's current tariff policy, assuming it remains in place, would generate about $2.1 trillion in revenue over the next decade. By comparison, federal individual income taxes would provide more than 10 times that amount, at $32 trillion over the same period, she said.",
      "Personal taxes provide about $2.7 trillion annually in federal revenue, according to IRS data. For fiscal year 2025, the U.S. generated $195 billion in tariff revenue, Treasury data\u00a0shows.",
      "\"Tariffs, even applied maximally, simply could not generate that level of revenue \u2014 imports are not a large enough tax base,\" York said.",
      "To be sure, tariff revenue could be used to provide a tax cut, said Scott Lincicome, vice president of general economics at the nonpartisan Cato Institute. However, because low-income households already pay little to no income tax, it's unlikely to help the families most in need of a financial boost, he noted.",
      "\"If they did a flat 3% reduction in income tax, the only people who would really benefit are the top 10%\" of income earners, Lincicome said.",
      "The top 10% of earners pay about 72% of the nation's income taxes, according to Tax Foundation data.",
      "What about a tariff dividend?",
      "Mr. Trump has also discussed the possibility of sending Americans a $2,000 \"tariff dividend\" check, an idea he reiterated during the Dec. 2 Cabinet meeting.",
      "Yet that proposal also faces a troublesome math problem, Lincicome said. Sending a one-time $2,000 payment to U.S. households would cost between $300 billion and $600 billion \u2014 far more than the U.S. is currently collecting in tariffs, he pointed out.",
      "Issuing a tariff payment or reducing income taxes also would require Congress to change the tax code \u2014 a tall legislative task given the ongoing partisanship in Congress. Some Republican lawmakers have already rebuffed the idea of a $2,000 payment, with Sen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin recently\u00a0saying\u00a0the U.S. \"can't afford\" it.",
      "Meanwhile, the U.S. is unlikely to raise enough tariff revenue to fund dividend checks or replace the individual income tax because that would require import taxes so high that Americans would stop buying most imported goods, causing tariff revenue to collapse, Lincicome explained.",
      "\"There is a hard cap on the amount of money you can raise with tariffs,\" he added. Economists \"say you can maybe raise $700 billion a year, which would be a very high effective tax rate \u2014 an across-the-board 20% to 30% tariff rate \u2014 but if it's pushed above that, nobody would buy imports.\"",
      "The overall average effective tariff rate facing U.S. consumers is now nearly 17%, the highest level since 1935, according to the\u00a0Yale Budget Lab, a nonpartisan policy research center.",
      "How do tariffs differ from income taxes?",
      "Setting aside the difference in the scale of revenue collection, tariffs are structured differently from income taxes. U.S. companies that import products, parts and other goods from abroad pay a fee based on the country of origin \u2014 for instance, American firms pay a 15% tariff on imports from the European Union.",
      "That means an American company importing a $5 Italian chocolate bar would pay the U.S. government an additional 75 cents, and then decide whether to pass that extra cost on to consumers or absorb it.",
      "Because of their structure, tariffs are often compared with sales taxes, where sellers pay a percentage of an item's cost when they check out at a store.",
      "By contrast, individual income taxes are progressive, meaning lower-income Americans pay a smaller tax rate than higher-earning households. The lowest bracket is 10%, while the top rate is 37%.",
      "Replacing the graduated income tax with a flat tariff rate would likely leave low- and middle-income households shouldering a bigger share of the burden than higher-income earners, York said.",
      "\"Tariffs are relatively flat, and even slightly regressive, placing a larger burden on working-class households than on the rich,\" she said. \"The income tax is the opposite \u2014 it is highly progressive and even provides negative income tax rates for the lowest income households.\"",
      "She added, \"Swapping a highly progressive income tax for a slightly regressive tariff scheme would harm the very households the president claims to be helping.\"",

    "published": "Wed, 03 Dec 2025 21:49:00 -0500",
    "summary": "The former officials said the FDA's plans to revamp how certain life-saving vaccines are handled would \"disadvantage the people the FDA exists to protect, including millions of Americans at high risk from serious infections.\"",
    "story": [
      "A dozen prior leaders of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration \u2014 appointed by Republicans and Democrats alike \u2014 issued a scathing denunciation of new FDA assertions casting doubt on vaccine safety.",
      "The former officials said the agency's plans to revamp how life-saving vaccines for flu, COVID-19 and other respiratory diseases are handled \u2014 outlined in an internal FDA memo last week \u2014 would \"disadvantage the people the FDA exists to protect, including millions of Americans at high risk from serious infections.\"",
      "\"The proposed new directives are not small adjustments or coherent policy updates. They represent a major shift in the FDA's understanding of its job,\" the officials, former FDA commissioners and acting commissioners, wrote Wednesday in The New England Journal of Medicine.",
      "The internal memo by FDA vaccine chief Dr. Vinay Prasad hasn't been publicly released. The memo said a review \"found that at least 10 children have died after and because of receiving COVID-19 vaccination,\" multiple sources familiar with it told CBS News on Saturday.",
      "Prasad suggested that the deaths were related to myocarditis, or the inflammation of the heart muscle, the sources said. Prasad did not share any data used in the review, including the children's ages, whether they had existing health conditions, or how the FDA determined there was a link between their death and the vaccine. The findings were not published in a peer-reviewed medical journal.",
      "It went on to outline planned agency changes in handling those and certain other vaccines and said that FDA staff who disagreed should resign.",
      "Among Prasad's plans were revising how yearly flu shot updates are handled and focusing more on \"the benefits and harms of giving multiple vaccines at the same time.\" A common message of vaccine skeptics is that too many shots may overwhelm kids' immune systems or that ingredients may build up to cause harm, although scientists say repeated research into those claims has turned up no concerns.",
      "On Wednesday, the former FDA leaders wrote that Prasad's claim about child deaths related to COVID-19 vaccines had been reported to a surveillance system that doesn't contain medical records or other information sufficient to prove a link \u2014 and that government scientists had carefully combed through those reports in previous years, reaching different conclusions. They also noted that \"substantial evidence\" shows COVID-19 vaccines reduce children's risk of severe disease and hospitalization.",
      "\"The memo asserts, incorrectly, that 'we do not have reliable data' on the benefits of Covid vaccination in children,\" the former FDA officials wrote. \"Reasonable scientists should engage in open debate about how best to shape recommendations for children at lower risk for Covid-19, but substantial evidence shows that vaccination can reduce the risk of severe disease and hospitalization in many children and adolescents.\"",
      "But the bigger picture, the former FDA leaders argued, is that the new proposals would reject long-standing science about how to evaluate vaccines being updated to better match virus strains, slow innovation to replace older vaccines with newer, potentially better ones, and make the process less transparent to the public.",
      "A spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services said in a statement Wednesday night, \"The fact these criticisms are coming from former FDA officials who opposed raising the bar for vaccine science confirms we are on the right track.\"",
      "Many doctors and public health experts have also expressed alarm about the memo.",
      "\"Vaccines save lives, period,\" Dr. Ronald Nahass, president of the Infectious Diseases Society of America, said in a statement. \"It is a sad day when FDA creates confusion and mistrust without supplying evidence, spreading propaganda that makes lifesaving vaccines harder to access and that creates additional confusion and mistrust for the public.\"",
      "The FDA's planned vaccine changes come at a time when Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. \u2014 who helped lead the anti-vaccine movement for years \u2014 is seeking to broadly remake federal policies on vaccines.",
      "Kennedy already ousted a committee that advised the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on vaccine recommendations and replaced it with handpicked members. And in August, he fired Susan Monarez 29 days into her tenure as CDC chief over vaccine policy disagreements. The CDC's vaccine advisory committee will meet Thursday and Friday to discuss hepatitis B vaccinations in newborns and other vaccine topics.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A bipartisan deal on health care remains elusive in the Senate with a key vote on Affordable Care Act tax credits set for next week.",
      "\"The conversations continue,\" Senate Majority Leader John Thune said Tuesday. \"I don't think at this point we have a clear path forward, I don't think the Democrats have a clear path forward \u2014 and they're the ones that are going to have to put forward their plan to get voted on next week.\"",
      "A group of Senate Democrats last month secured a vote to address expiring Affordable Care Act enhanced tax credits, which were at the heart of the government shutdown fight, as part of the deal to reopen the government. That vote is set to occur next week, when Democrats will have the opportunity to present the legislation of their choice.",
      "Democrats could pursue a compromise position that stands a chance at earning the 60 votes needed to advance, or they could seek an extension that wouldn't pick up enough support from Republicans but would force GOP members to take a politically uncomfortable vote. Millions of Americans are due to see their health insurance premiums skyrocket in the new year without action from Congress.",
      "Dwindling prospects for a bipartisan compromise",
      "Republicans have been critical of the Affordable Care Act since it became law in 2010. But with premiums set to rise with the expiration of the tax credits, which help pay for health insurance premiums for plans purchased on state exchanges, some GOP lawmakers have acknowledged a need for a short-term extension. And the planned vote next week puts pressure on Republicans to come together on a strategy.",
      "Thune, a South Dakota Republican, said Tuesday that there are some in the GOP conference who want to work with Democrats \"in a constructive way on something that could be a bipartisan solution, but that hasn't landed yet.\"",
      "Among the issues at the center of the impasse is the Hyde amendment, which restricts federal funding for abortions. Thune called it a \"difficult, challenging\" issue for both sides. The majority leader told reporters Wednesday that \"our members are very committed, obviously, and with good reason, to ensuring that the Hyde protections apply to Obamacare policies.\"",
      "\"The Democrats clearly have a different view, and that has always been probably one of the biggest obstacles to getting a deal,\" Thune said. \"That one is a really challenging one.\"",
      "Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said \"as long as Republicans are wedded to expanding Hyde, they can't even talk about anything else.\"",
      "On Democrats' position more broadly, the New York Democrat said Tuesday that \"we're willing to talk to anybody who's willing to lower costs,\" but he claimed \"the Republicans are in total disarray and have no plan.\"",
      "Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut, a top progressive voice in the chamber, told reporters Tuesday that he wants a clean, multi-year extension of the tax credits, \"but I understand that's not likely to get 13 Republican votes.\"",
      "\"So yeah, I'm certainly open for a one-year extension, some restrictions on income,\" he said. \"But it just doesn't seem like Republicans are interested in anything. I mean, they might not even offer their own proposal because it appears that they can't even get 53 votes on anything related to extending these subsidies.\"",
      "Republicans work to coalesce around a strategy",
      "Thune said Senate Republicans had a \"robust discussion\" at their conference lunch meeting Tuesday and heard from two top committee chairs. But there was no apparent breakthrough. He said Republicans \"continue to coalesce\" around a health care solution, with a number of ideas percolating in recent weeks.",
      "Multiple Senate Republicans said after the lunch meeting that they expect that GOP leadership will put forward a bill alongside the Democrat-led ACA measure for Republicans to vote on if Democrats pursue a partisan approach, a move which would alleviate pressure on their conference. But Thune said until they know what the Democrats are planning to put forward, \"we won't probably have our strategy ready.\"",
      "Without a negotiated bipartisan approach, neither bill would be likely to get the votes needed to advance. And what that GOP legislation looks like remains to be seen.",
      "Sen. John Hoeven, a North Dakota Republican, told reporters that \"if the Democrats want to keep working, we're willing to do that.\"",
      "\"If they say, 'nope, we want to have a vote,' we'll have a plan,\" Hoeven said. \"It's not finalized yet, but we'll obviously have something ready to go. We've got a lot of good ideas.\"",
      "Sen. Bill Cassidy, a Louisiana Republican, has outlined his proposal aimed at lowering health care costs in recent weeks. His plan would take roughly the same amount of money that would be needed to extend the enhanced ACA tax credits and put that into health savings accounts for those who use bronze plans. The idea is that people would save on premiums by switching to the bronze plans, while they would also be able to use the HSA funds toward their deductibles.",
      "Meanwhile, Sen. Rick Scott, a Florida Republican, unveiled another proposal ahead of the Thanksgiving break. Scott framed his bill as something that could drive down costs by giving people options. The proposal would create HSA-style accounts to pay for health insurance.",
      "\"Mine's pretty simple \u2014 if you like your Obamacare, keep your Obamacare,\" Scott told CBS News.",
      "Sen. Josh Hawley, a Missouri Republican, told reporters Tuesday that he plans to pitch a proposal to effectively end taxes on health care costs. He said the idea would work in conjunction with \"some form of premium support.\"",
      "Thune also lauded an idea that would allow individuals to sign up for \"association\" health care coverage, in which small businesses and the self-employed collectively purchase coverage to lower costs. The proposal would allow companies like Costco and Walmart to offer health policies across state lines.",
      "\"I think it's a great idea, something we've been for for a long time,\" Thune said. \"It's always been resisted by Democrats, but buying across state lines, allowing people to join larger groups, to get into the group market, out of the individual market \u2026 That is a way that you could significantly address the issue of cost and affordability.\"",
      "Waiting on the White House",
      "The debate within the Senate GOP is happening in anticipation of input from the White House. Last week, reports indicated that the White House was planning to propose a two-year extension of Affordable Care Act tax credits with new limits. But the proposal seemed to dissipate after GOP lawmakers resisted, and President Trump told reporters he prefers a plan to give money directly to people over insurance companies and would rather not extend the subsidies.",
      "\"Somebody said I want to extend them for two years, I don't want to extend them for two years,\" Mr. Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One. \"I'd rather not extend them at all. It may be, some kind of an extension may be necessary to get something else done, because the Unaffordable Care Act has been a disaster.\"",
      "As the president's advisers were drafting a plan to continue the subsidies for an additional two years, Speaker Mike Johnson had told the White House in a phone call with senior administration officials that most House Republicans have little interest in extending the Affordable Care Act's enhanced subsidies, sources familiar with the conversation told CBS News.",
      "White House National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett outlined the back and forth on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Sunday.",
      "\"Sometimes people leak pre-decisional things that are confidential and pre-decisional,\" Hassett said. \"And I think that somebody did that, and then it rolled back because it hadn't been through the whole process, but President Trump has been clear that he's very concerned about the cost of health care.\"",
      "Hassett predicted that \"people are going to work this out\" before Christmas. He added that the White House has \"a solution for cost-sharing, and the Democrats have an alternative.\"",

    "published": "Wed, 03 Dec 2025 14:20:59 -0500",
    "summary": "Samples collected from the asteroid Bennu are continuing the shed light on the origins of the solar system and how life developed on Earth, scientists say.",
    "story": [
      "Samples taken from\u00a0the asteroid Bennu\u00a0are continuing to shed light on the origins of the solar system.",
      "Scientists have been studying the samples since NASA's Osiris-REx spacecraft carried them back to Earth in 2020 and recently discovered that that they contain sugars and \"a gum-like substance not seen before in astromaterials,\" NASA said.",
      "The revelations \u2014 and how they can help answer big questions about the beginnings of life \u2014 are described in three new papers published Tuesday by the journals Nature Geosciences and Nature Astronomy.",
      "In the first paper, scientists led by Yoshihiro Furukawa of Japan's Tohoku University focus on sugars uncovered in the asteroid samples, which are characterized as essential building blocks for biology on Earth. The second, by Scott Sandford at NASA's Ames Research Center and Zack Gainsforth of the University of California at Berkeley, reveals that the ancient \"space gum\" also present in the samples could have played a foundational role in catalyzing early life on our planet.",
      "The third paper, led by Ann Nguyen of NASA's Johnson Space Center, analyzed dust from two different types of rock that Osiris-REx collected from Bennu, which initially came from stars that predate the solar system.",
      "Ingredients for existence",
      "Each of the three papers zeroes in on a clue from the Bennu asteroid as to how the solar system developed and how life on Earth eventually came to be.",
      "The sugars discovered in the asteroid samples, along with other molecules like amino acids previously detected in them, do not necessarily provide evidence of life, NASA said. But they do show that fundamental elements of the compounds that make up living organisms and allow biological processes to happen within individual cells were, at least at one time, widespread throughout the solar system. Some of the basic molecules used to construct DNA \u2014 and RNA, a vital messenger that codes and decodes genetic information \u2014 were found in the samples from Bennu, researchers said.",
      "Furukawa said the sugars found in the Bennu samples support a hypothesis about the survival mechanisms used by the first forms of earthly life, which may have relied primarily on the messenger molecule rather than the complicated biological processes that ground it today.",
      "\"Present day life is based on a complex system,\" he said. \"However, early life may have been simpler.\"",
      "The mysterious \"space gum\" never seen in cosmic rocks before its discovery in the Bennu samples likely formed in the solar system's infancy, NASA said. According to the agency, the molecules it contains \"could have provided some of the chemical precursors that helped trigger life on Earth.\"",
      "The gum is an important piece of the puzzle for scientists studying how life on the planet began and whether it exists elsewhere.",
      "\"With this strange substance, we're looking at, quite possibly, one of the earliest alterations of materials that occurred in this rock,\" said Sandford, who co-led the paper on Bennu's surprising gum. \"On this primitive asteroid that formed in the early days of the solar system, we're looking at events near the beginning of the beginning.\"",
      "Some of the new research also examines the formation of Bennu itself, which, like other asteroids in the solar system, is a rock left over from the system's nascent stage. The dust discovered in two samples from the asteroid is a substance that scientists believe was already well-mixed when the solar system formed, according to NASA. Because such high concentrations of it were detected in the samples, Bennu may have developed in a region \"enriched in the dust of dying stars,\" the agency said.",

    "published": "Wed, 03 Dec 2025 13:39:12 -0500",
    "summary": "Kian Sadeghi, the 25-year-old founder and CEO at Nucleus Genomics, tells \"CBS Mornings\" that parents have every right to select the qualities and traits they desire in their child.",
    "story": [
      "Big leaps in science have made a once-impossible, much-debated question come to life: Would you design your unborn child?",
      "Kian Sadeghi, the 25-year-old founder and CEO at Nucleus Genomics, believes every parent has a right to do just that, selecting qualities they desire \u2013 from height to weight to intelligence. He calls it \"genetic optimization,\" and it's part of a Silicon Valley push to breed \"super-babies.\"",
      "Sadeghi dropped out of the University of Pennsylvania and started the company in 2021, inspired by a cousin who died of a rare genetic illness. Backed by investors and prominent tech entrepreneurs like Peter Thiel and Alexis Ohanian, Sadeghi says his company has already helped thousands of families.",
      "\"It's the parents' right to know\"",
      "\"We give you the full range of insights there is to know about your future child. We really think it's the parents' right to know,\" he told \"CBS Mornings\" in an interview that aired Wednesday.",
      "Genetic testing companies like Nucleus say DNA screening of embryos can prevent disease, while also giving parents a unique ability to compare and choose traits that make up a healthier baby \u2013 and one that's more desirable in the eyes of mom and dad.",
      "\"They want us to, you know, play sports and they want us to go to the best school. They want us to be well educated. They want us to thrive. Life, I think, as a parent doesn't just stop at 'I want my child to be healthy,'\" Sadeghi said.",
      "For $30,000, Nucleus offers a program called IVF+, which includes full DNA scans of both parents and up to 20 embryos conceived through in vitro fertilization. The results come back in the form of a sleek, user-friendly menu.",
      "Advanced DNA screenings",
      "The company screens embryo samples for more than 2,000 traits and conditions, including eye color, hair color, intelligence \u2013 even acne. It also can estimate genetic predisposition to medical conditions such as depression, autism and bipolar disorder.",
      "Sadeghi says this \"genetic optimization\" allows parents to minimize disease while maximizing traits they prefer. However, critics have drawn comparisons to a different term: \"eugenics.\"",
      "\"[It's not eugenics] by any stretch, because it's fundamentally about empowering people with information that they can use to give their child the best start in life,\" he said. \"And yes, if you want 2 inches taller for your child, 3 inches taller, right, if you want a couple IQ-point difference, absolutely, by all means, do that. But I'm saying, you're really asking me here, you're asking me, what is life about? That's what you're really getting at when you talk about height and IQ, right, they're abstractions of life.\"",
      "Ethical debate over reproductive genetics",
      "But while companies like Nucleus continue to grow, some medical experts point to the ethical dilemmas surrounding these types of new reproductive technologies. An article published in the MIT Technology Review in October argued the race to create the \"perfect baby\" is actually creating an \"ethical mess.\"",
      "In a\u00a0statement last year, the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics said the practice of genetic screenings and use of polygenic risk scores for embryo selection has \"moved too fast with too little evidence.\"",
      "\"In this statement we do not address either individual or broader social, ethical, and regulatory issues this testing raises,\" the group noted.",
      "But Sadeghi said he remains confident in the data.",
      "\"Our predictors can better predict longevity from an embryo's DNA than any other genetic model ever built,\" he said.",
      "However, he pushes back on the criticism that he's creating a new class of \"superhumans.\"",
      "\"DNA is not destiny, the messiness of life, the nurture element of life, right, how hard your child works, you know, what school they go to, what resources they have, serendipity, all those factors are never, ever going to go away,\" Sadeghi said.",

    "published": "Tue, 02 Dec 2025 13:32:35 -0500",
    "summary": "Ant colonies act as one \"super-organism\" which works to ensure the survival of all, according to a team of scientists.",
    "story": [
      "Sick young ants release a smell to tell worker ants to destroy them to protect the colony from infection, scientists said Tuesday, adding that queens do not seem to commit this act of self-sacrifice.",
      "Many animals conceal illness for social reasons. For example, sick humans are known to risk infecting others so they can still go to the office \u2014 or the pub.",
      "Ant colonies, however, act as one \"super-organism\" which works to ensure the survival of all, similar to how infected cells in our bodies send out a \"find-me and eat-me\" signal, according to an Austria-led team of scientists.",
      "Ant nests are a \"perfect place for a disease outbreak to occur because there are thousands of ants crawling over each other,\" Erika Dawson, a behavioral ecologist at the Institute of Science and Technology Austria and lead author of a new study titled \"Altruistic disease signaling in ant colonies,\" told AFP.",
      "When adult worker ants get an illness that could spread through the colony, they leave the nest to die alone. Young ants, known as pupae, in contrast are still trapped inside a cocoon, making this kind of social distancing impossible.",
      "Scientists had already figured out that when these pupae are terminally ill, there is a chemical change that produces a particular smell. Adult worker ants then gather around, remove the cocoon, \"bite holes in the pupae and insert poison,\" Dawson said. The poison acts as a disinfectant, which kills both the colony-threatening pathogen and the pupae.",
      "For the new research, the scientists wanted to figure out whether the pupae \"were actively saying: 'hey, come and kill me,'\" Dawson said.",
      "\"Altruistic act\"",
      "First, the scientists extracted the smell from the sick pupae of a small black garden ant called Lasius neglectus. When they applied the smell to a healthy brood in the lab, the workers still destroyed them.",
      "Then, the team conducted an experiment showing that the sick pupae only produce the smell when worker ants are nearby, proving it is a deliberate signal for destruction.",
      "\"While it is a sacrifice \u2014 an altruistic act \u2014 it's also in their own interest, because it means that their genes are going to survive and be passed on to the next generation,\" Dawson said.",
      "However, there is one member of the nest that does not sacrifice itself. When queen pupae are infected inside their cocoons, they do not send out the smelly warning signal, the team found.",
      "\"Are they cheating the system?\" Dawson said the team asked themselves.",
      "However, they found that the \"queen pupae have much better immune systems than the worker pupae, and so they were able to fight off the infection \u2014 and that's why we think that they weren't signaling,\" she said.",
      "The study's authors note that sick queens face a conundrum.",
      "\"By alerting others to destroy them, queen pupae would risk losing potential future reproductive opportunities if they would survive infection,\" the authors write. \"On the other hand, by spreading their infection to their colony, they could incur high indirect fitness costs.\"",
      "Dawson hopes future research will investigate whether queen pupae sacrifice themselves when it becomes clear they will not beat their infection.",
      "The study was published in the journal Nature Communications.",
      "Scientists have previously studied\u00a0how ants communicate. A Stanford University study\u00a0published\u00a0in 2012 showed that harvester ants transmit information to determine how many ants to send to a particular food source. Researchers concluded that ants communicate in much the same way as data moves on the internet, dubbing it the \"anternet.\"",
      "Researchers have also previously concluded that other sick species practice social distancing \u2014\u00a0including guppies, bats and mandrills. Bees have been documented using tactics to prevent getting sick, including\u00a0kicking sick bees out of their hives\u00a0altogether.",

    "published": "Wed, 03 Dec 2025 06:44:21 -0500",
    "summary": "India's government, amid an uproar over privacy, has revoked an order quietly issued to smartphone makers to pre-install a state-run security app.",
    "story": [
      "New Delhi \u2014\u00a0India's government revoked an order on Wednesday that had directed smartphone makers such as Apple and Samsung to install a state-developed and owned security app on all new devices. The move came after two days of criticism from opposition politicians and privacy organizations that the \"Sanchar Saathi\" app was an effort to snoop on citizens through their phones.",
      "\"Government has decided not to make the pre-installation mandatory for mobile manufacturers,\" India's Ministry of Communications said in a statement Wednesday afternoon.",
      "The initial order, issued privately to phone makers by the ministry late last month, was leaked to Indian media outlets on Monday. It directed all phone makers to preinstall the Sanchar Saathi (which means Communication Partner in Hindi) app on new phones within 90 days, and also on older phones through software updates.",
      "The order, reported from Monday by numerous Indian media outlets and later acknowledged by the government, had asked manufacturers to ensure that the functions of the app could not be \"disabled or restricted.\"",
      "There was an immediate backlash on Monday, with opposition political parties quickly labelling the government software a \"snooping app\" and drawing parallels to Pegasus, the hacking spyware developed, marketed and licensed to governments around the world by the Israeli company NSO Group.",
      "On Tuesday, India's national Minister of Communications Jyotiraditya Scindia insisted to journalists outside the parliament that the Sanchar Sathi app was non-compulsory and in line with democratic principles. He said smartphone owners could activate the app at their convenience to access its benefits, and they could also delete it from devices at any time.",
      "He did not, however, say anything on Tuesday to deny or change the order to phone makers to ensure the app was pre-installed.",
      "On Wednesday, Scindia insisted that \"neither is snooping possible, nor it will be done\" with the app.",
      "While the order for it to be installed universally was revoked, the government continued defending the app on Wednesday, saying the intent had been to \"provide access to cybersecurity to all citizens,\" and insisting that it was \"secure and purely meant to help citizens.\"",
      "Opposition politicians say \"it is a snooping app\"",
      "The government's U-turn came after sharp criticism from opposition political parties and digital rights advocates.",
      "\"It is a snooping app. It's ridiculous. Citizens have the right to privacy. Everyone must have the right to privacy to send messages to family, friends, without the government looking at everything,\" Priyanka Gandhi, leader of the opposition Congress party, told reporters outside India's parliament on Tuesday.",
      "\"They brought in Pegasus and have been unable to keep it under control. MPs and MLAs all say that their phones are being tapped. For the last 11 years, basic rights of the Indians have been taken away... This is the real violation of National Security,\" said Renuka Chowdhury, another Congress member.",
      "Digital privacy advocates also raised concerns about the government order, saying it would breach citizens' right to privacy in a country with more than 1.2 billion cell phone users.",
      "\"No government will ever be expected to acknowledge that a government app is a snooping tool, even in China and Russia, where such apps have been mandated,\" Indian technology analyst Prasanto K. Roy told CBS News on Wednesday. \"A government statement alone is not adequate to inspire confidence in this.\"",
      "Roy said the government should restrict the default permissions settings that enable the app to access data on smartphones to the absolute minimum, and explain why those permissions were deemed necessary. He added that the code for the app should be open-source and published online, to enable independent security professionals to scrutinise it.",
      "\"In plain terms, this converts every smartphone sold in India into a vessel for state-mandated software that the user cannot meaningfully refuse, control, or remove,\" the Internet for Freedom organization said in a statement Tuesday, before the government revoked its order. \"For this to work in practice, the app will almost certainly need system level or root level access \u2026 so that it cannot be disabled. That design choice erodes the protections that normally prevent one app from peering into the data of others, and turns Sanchar Saathi into a permanent, non-consensual point of access sitting inside the operating system of every Indian smartphone user.\"",
      "Technology analyst Roy told CBS News the real issue was \"not about faith in the government's benevolence,\" but rather \"concerns about potential access to a wide range of data by many junior or mid-level officials in government or law enforcement,\" as there was no clarity about what data could be accessed via the app, or who would have access to it.",
      "Major phone makers did not publicly react to the government order, but the Reuters news agency reported that Apple had planned to refuse to comply.",
      "Indian government says it's just trying to help",
      "The government argues that the app allows users to track, block and recover lost or stolen smartphones using the device's International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI), a unique code assigned to all handsets sold around the world.",
      "It also enables users to check how many unique mobile data connections are registered under their name, which it says will help people identify and disable fraudulent numbers and accounts opened by scammers.",
      "Other features include tools to report suspected fraudulent calls and to verify the authenticity of devices being used to make purchases, according to officials.",
      "The government said in its multiple statements that the app had already been downloaded 14 million times, and used to help trace 2.6 million lost or stolen phones. It said Sanchar Sathi had helped in the disconnection of over 4 million fraudulent connections, based on citizen reports.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/children-smartphones-increased-risk-of-health-problems-study/",
    "published": "Mon, 01 Dec 2025 19:16:23 -0500",
    "summary": "Children and adolescents who own smartphones by age 12 have higher risks of depression, poor sleep and obesity, according to a new study.",
    "story": [
      "Having a smartphone may be harmful for children younger than 12, according to a new study.",
      "The study published Monday in the peer-reviewed journal\u00a0Pediatrics\u00a0found that owning a smartphone during early adolescence is associated with increased risks of mental health issues and obesity. As far as psychological impacts, it pinpointed higher incidences of depression and insufficient sleep among children who owned smartphones by ages 12 or younger, compared with others kids without the devices.",
      "Researchers at Children's Hospital Philadelphia, the University of California at Berkeley, and Columbia University arrived at those conclusions after analyzing data from more than 10,000 adolescents around the United States who participated in the\u00a0Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development Study\u00a0(ABCD) between 2018 and 2020. That study, funded by the National Institutes of Health, describes itself as \"the largest long-term study of brain development and child health\" in the country.",
      "According to researchers, 63.6% of the ABCD study's participants owned a smartphone, and the median age they received them was at 11 years old. Using that data, the researchers determined that younger children had greater risks than older participants of poor sleep or obesity linked to smartphone ownership, with increasingly worse health outcomes reported for kids the younger they were when they received their first smartphone.",
      "\"We didn't even look at what the kids did on the phone,\" Ran Barzilay, the lead author of the study and a child psychiatrist with the Youth Suicide Prevention, Intervention and Research Center at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, told CBS News. \"We basically asked one simple question: does the mere factor of having one's own smartphone at this age range have anything to do with health outcomes?\"",
      "The Pediatrics study also compared children who had obtained a smartphone by age 12 and children who had not, and found that one year later, those without smartphones were experiencing better mental health than those who had them.",
      "\"We did account for the fact that the kids may have had other technological devices like tablets or iPads, and it did not change the results,\" Barzilay said in an interview on CBS News' \"The Daily Report.\"",
      "In a separate\u00a0statement, Barzilay said his study's findings suggest that parents should see smartphones as having \"a significant factor in teen health\" and approach the decision to give children a phone with care and consideration. He noted that smartphones \"can play a constructive role\" in teens' lives by strengthening their social connections and helping them learn, adding that some families see smartphones as necessary for their children's safety.",
      "Going forward, Barzilay said the researchers behind the study hope to investigate which aspects of smartphone use and ownership are connected with negative health effects for young people. Researchers intend to study younger children, who acquired smartphones before age 10, in an effort to understand who is most vulnerable to the detrimental impacts of smartphone use who and who could most benefit from it. Ultimately, Barzilay said the goal is to identify ways to protect children and adolescents who own smartphones from the consequences outlined in their findings.",
      "In recent years, a growing number of experts have sounded the alarm about increased screen time and the effect it has on kids and teens. In a 2023\u00a0advisory\u00a0on social media use and mental health, former U.S. Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy recommended creating\u00a0\"tech-free zones\"\u00a0and encouraging kids to \"foster in-person friendships.\" Meanwhile,\u00a0several states\u00a0have taken steps to\u00a0ban cellphones\u00a0in schools.",
      "According to\u00a0Pew Research Center, 95% of teens between the ages of 13 and 17 owned a smartphone in 2024. More than half of parents with children between the ages of 11 and 12 who were surveyed by the research center at that time said their kids also owned smartphones. The same survey found that nearly 30% of parents with children between 8 and 10 years old said their kids owned smartphones, as did 12% of parents with children between 5 and 7 years old, and 8% of parents with children younger than 5.",
      "\"Most probably, all teens will eventually have a smartphone,\" said Barzilay. \"Once this happens, it is advisable to monitor what our children do on their phones, ensuring they're not exposed to inappropriate content and that smartphones don't disrupt sleep.\"",

    "story": [
      "Nearly three decades after 15-year-old Danielle \"Danni\" Houchins was found dead near a fishing access site in Montana, authorities say DNA has finally led them to her killer \u2014 a married father of two who died by suicide just hours after he was interviewed by investigators about the cold case.",
      "The Gallatin County Sheriff's Office said Thursday that advanced DNA testing and forensic genetic genealogy recently led authorities to identify Houchins' killer as 55-year-old Paul Hutchinson.",
      "On Sept. 21, 1996 at about 11 a.m., Houchins left her home in Belgrade, Montana and when she never returned, her family called the police. Her mother found Houchins' truck at a popular fishing access site on the Gallatin River, and later that night, Houchins' body was found face down in shallow water, the sheriff's office said.",
      "DNA evidence was collected at the scene and numerous suspects were interviewed over the years, but no arrests were made and the case went cold.",
      "Finally, authorities renewed efforts to solve the case, and in 2021, when Dan Springer became Gallatin County's sheriff, he brought in two outside experts from California to assist \u2014 private investigator Tom Elfmont, a retired Los Angeles Police Department officer, and Sergeant Court Depweg, who specializes in using DNA technology to solve homicides.",
      "Four hairs that were collected from Houchins' body at the crime scene were used to create a partial DNA profile, the sheriff's office said. That profile was ultimately sent to a lab in Virginia, where genealogists used DNA databases to identify Hutchinson as a possible suspect.",
      "On July 23, 2024, Elfmont and Depweg interviewed Hutchinson, who lived about 100 miles away from the crime, in Dillon, Montana.",
      "\"During the nearly two-hour interview, Hutchinson, who had lived in Bozeman at the time of Houchins' death, displayed extreme nervousness,\" the sheriff's office said. \"Investigators noted he sweated profusely, scratched his face, and chewed on his hand. When shown a photo of Houchins, Hutchinson slumped in his chair and exhibited signs of being uncomfortable. Upon release, his behavior was observed to be erratic. \"",
      "Early the next morning, officials say, Hutchinson called the Beaverhead County Sheriff's Office, saying he needed assistance before hanging up. He was found on the side of the road, dead from a self-inflicted gunshot wound, the sheriff's office said.",
      "Investigators have determined that Houchins and Hutchinson didn't know each other, describing the murder as a \"crime of opportunity.\" They believed Hutchinson, who at the time was a student at Montana State University, randomly encountered Houchins before raping her and suffocating her in shallow water.",
      "Authorities say Hutchinson graduated with a degree in fisheries wildlife biology and then worked for the Montana Bureau of Land Management for 22 years. He had no criminal history and was married with two adult children.",
      "\"This case exemplifies our relentless pursuit of justice. We never gave up on finding the truth for Danni and her family, exhausting all means necessary to bring closure to this heartbreaking chapter,\"\u00a0Springer said. \"The investigation remained open because we knew Danni was murdered and someday, we were going to have the tools available to solve this case.\"",
      "Houchins' younger sister, Stephanie Mollet, spoke alongside the sheriff at a news conference Thursday.",
      "\"Even though this man will not face a jury of his peers, I have no doubt he was the one who forcefully and violently sexually assaulted my sister, then held her head down in a marsh until she choked to death on mud,\" said Mollet. \"When the time came to face up and account for his violence, he instead chose to end his life. He knew of his guilt and couldn't face my family or his family and the pain he caused.\"",

    "summary": "Danni Houchins was found dead in a swamp in Montana. Decades later, a friend of Danni's sister realized she'd been alone with Danni's killer in the wilderness.",
    "story": [
      "Late on Sept. 21, 1996, searchers found the body of 15-year-old Danielle \"Danni\" Houchins in a swampy area along the Gallatin River, a scenic valley just outside Bozeman, Montana. Exactly what had happened to Danni -- and how she had ended up face down in the mud -- would mystify her family, friends and investigators for decades.",
      "The case, and its stunning conclusion, is investigated by \"48 Hours\" and correspondent Peter Van Sant in \"It's About Danni.\"\u00a0An encore of the broadcast airs Saturday, Dec. 6 \u00a0at 9/8c on CBS and streaming on Paramount+.",
      "Back in 1996, Rachelle Schrute, now the Hunt & Fish editor at GearJunkie, knew both Danni and her sister Stephanie. She recalled, \"They were the most down-to-earth, friendly people.\"\u00a0 Stephanie Mollet told Van Sant that there had been a family argument that morning, and Danni drove off to the Cameron Bridge Fishing Access area to get away. When Danni didn't come home that afternoon, their mother set out to find her. She found Danni's truck parked in the lot, her keys and water bottle along a nearby path, but no other signs of Danni. Deputies from the Gallatin County Sheriff's Office were called in to help but stopped searching after dark. That night, family friends who knew the marshy, heavily wooded area well, headed out to also look for Danni. They found her body in the muddy undergrowth, far back from the walking path.",
      "As word about what happened to Danni spread, some people in town speculated her death could have been a murder. Detectives started an investigation, collecting evidence from the crime scene, and interviewing people close to Danni, but no suspects were named. Schrute said that around the community, \"there was so much other speculation \u2026 It just caused fear.\"",
      "But, within days, the coroner ruled that Danni had drowned, and that her manner of death was not a homicide, but rather \"undetermined.\" Danni's family says they were told by officials that Danni's death could have been an accident. \"That she 'could have just tripped and fell,'\" said Mollet. \"'We don't really know.'\" Mollet found that hard to believe. Danni was an active and outdoorsy teenager, she says, who was comfortable fishing, hiking, and mountain climbing. Danni's case went cold, and as Mollet grew into adulthood, she vowed to find out the truth. \"I promised my sister,\" said Stephanie. \"I'm coming for you, Danni.\"",
      "In 2020, Mollet connected with new detectives at the Gallatin County Sheriff's Office, and demanded they fill her family in on the investigation. They let Mollet read the autopsy report, and she learned that in 1996, officials knew that there were bruises on Danni's body, including on the back of her neck. \"Someone had held her head down forcefully,\" said Mollet. \"There was (sic) vaginal injuries \u2026 there was semen in her underwear \u2026 she had fought and scratched.\" There was now no doubt in Mollet's mind that her sister had been raped and murdered. The new investigators agreed, and re-opened Danni's case. The new Gallatin County Sheriff then did something unusual. He reached outside his department, to a retired investigator living in the hills outside of Bozeman: Tom Elfmont.",
      "Elfmont dedicated himself to Danni's case. Knowing that huge advances had been made in DNA technology, he was able to get a partial DNA profile from the semen found on Danni's underpants. But they couldn't find a match. Digging deeper, Elfmont focused in on four male hairs that had been found on Danni's body. They were \"rootless\" hairs \u2014 without any skin cells \u2014 which for a long time were thought of as almost impossible to get DNA from. But not anymore. Through a state-of-the-art private lab, Elfmont was able to get a full suspect DNA profile from one of those hairs. Elfmont shared that profile with an investigative genetic genealogist, who used family trees to search for relatives of the unknown suspect. In May 2024, they got a name: Paul Hutchinson.",
      "Elfmont learned that in 1996, Hutchinson had been a graduate student in nearby Bozeman, and he had a work-study with the Fish and Wildlife Service \"which would have put him on the waterways around Belgrade.\" Elfmont said Hutchinson went on to work as a fisheries biologist for the Bureau of Land Management. He had no criminal record and was married with two children. And he was well-known in local hunting and fishing circles.",
      "In July, 2024, with a body camera rolling, Eflmont and his partner went to Hutchinson's office to interview him. Elfmont said Hutchinson became visibly nervous, especially when asked about Danni's case. But they didn't directly ask Hutchinson if he had killed Danni. As Elfmont told Van Sant, \"Didn't need to.\" They didn't yet have enough evidence to arrest him, but hours after the interview, Hutchinson took his own life. Afterwards, his DNA was confirmed to match the evidence from Danni's body.",
      "When the Gallatin County sheriff announced the case had been solved after nearly 30 years, there was shock all around. But for Mollet's childhood friend, Schrute, it was even greater. As she heard the killer's name announced, she realized she had known him for almost 20 years. Schrute says she considered him a friend and had relied on him for years as a \"trusted resource when it came to hunting and fishing.\" \u00a0Not only that, but for years they had gone on hunting and fishing trips together -- sometimes just the two of them. For someone who had always trusted her gut \u2014 in the wild, and around men \u2014 Schrute says she never once questioned his character.",
      "When asked if she could have said something to him after finding out he had killed Danni, Schrute said strongly, \"How dare you just be a person in my life? How dare you just exist and go on to have \u2026 a family, and a career, and all of these things that you had? How dare you when you all along, you knew.\"",

      "And signs of possible sexual assault. The sheriff back then, Bill Slaughter, told \"48 Hours\" it is often common for investigators to withhold key details to protect their investigations as they looked into potential suspects \u2014 including people who were close to Danni.",
      "Keith Farquhar: Common sense says this girl was not an accidental death.",
      "Caught in the middle of this controversy was Deputy Keith Farquhar, then a young patrolman. He was assigned to work with detectives on the case. Farquhar spoke with Danni's doctor.",
      "Keith Farquhar: He \u2026 said there's nothing about her physical condition that would've prevented that girl from being able to roll over in a few inches of water and mud to breathe, if she had just fallen, if this was an accident.",
      "But when Farquhar tried to report the doctor's opinion to other investigators \u2014",
      "Keith Farquhar: I was pretty much ridiculed \u2026 by the sheriff.",
      "Peter Van Sant: What'd he say?",

      "Fed up and disillusioned, just three months after Danni's death, Farquhar resigned from the sheriff's office.",
      "As years passed, Danni's family tried to accept that her death might have been an accident.",
      "Peter Van Sant: As all that time, weeks to months to years go by and you have no answers, what was that like?",
      "Stephanie Mollet: Traumatizing. It was, uh, having a big wound in your life and this big gap that was unexplainable. And you somehow had to find a way to heal without answers, to live without resolution, um, to hope with no reason to hope.",
      "Until 24 years after Danni's death.",
      "Matt Boxmeyer was a detective sergeant with Gallatin County. He took an interest in Danni Houchins and her family.",
      "Matt Boxmeyer: I found out that they really hadn't been given much information back in 1996 regarding the investigation, which is not uncommon. \u2026 with investigations, you know, you don't openly talk about 'em with the family usually.",
      "Matt Boxmeyer: They'd been told that she had \u2026 fallen down and \u2014 and drowned. It was marked as accidental.",
      "Boxmeyer also found out that there had been several efforts over the years to get evidence analyzed by the Montana State Crime Lab.",
      "But after each attempt, nothing. No usable DNA profile ever came back. So he was starting from scratch. Meantime, Mollet decided to turn up the pressure.",
      "Stephanie Mollet: I had been calling the sheriff's department \u2026 trying to get someone to talk to me about Danni's case.",
      "Finally, Boxmeyer and his bosses made a decision.",
      "Matt Boxmeyer: They deserved some answers.",
      "They told the family that Danni's death was no accident.",
      "Matt Boxmeyer: I shared with them that I believe that it was a homicide.",
      "Mollet then demanded to read the autopsy and look at the crime scene photos.",
      "Stephanie Mollet: I was so angry at the people who lied to my family, and let my sister's murder go unsolved, but uninvestigated for all of these years.",
      "Stephanie Mollet: I learned that rather than drowning on just water, Danni's head had been held down in the mud \u2026 she had mud all the way down into her lungs and into her stomach. ... there was subcutaneous bruising on the back of her neck \u2026 someone had held her head down forcefully. \u2026 there was, vaginal injuries. \u2026 there was semen in her underwear. \u2026 she had fought and scratched.",
      "Peter Van Sant: This is like a \u2014 a nuclear bomb going off emotionally, I would think for this family and for you.",
      "Stephanie Mollet: I remember asking them, \"so you mean to tell me that in fact, my sister was raped?\" And they said, \"yes, we believe she was raped.\" \u2026 I remember (sigh) not being able to breathe. I remember feeling like I needed to puke.",
      "In 2021, with Danni's family now knowing the explosive truth, solving Danni's murder would become a top priority for newly appointed Sheriff Dan Springer.",
      "Peter Van Sant: You were a rookie deputy when this crime came down, right?",
      "Sheriff Dan Springer: Yeah. \u2026 Five days after I started is when we found Danni's body.",
      "Sheriff Dan Springer: When you become the boss, you get to decide to do things the way you want to do things. \u2026 I felt like, well, this is our time. Let's go get some answers.",
      "Sheriff Springer reached out to Stephanie.",
      "Sheriff Dan Springer: And I told her \u2026 I am making a promise that we will find an answer to this case.",
      "Now determined to set things right, Springer reached outside the department to a most unusual investigator: Tom Elfmont.",
      "Tom Elfmont: I'm \u2026 very persistent \u2026 I have \u2026 a bulldog personality \u2026",
      "Tom Elfmont: I just don't give up on something. I just don't do it.",
      "He'd spent a lifetime in tough jobs, from a soldier in Vietnam to a cop working the streets of LA.",
      "Tom Elfmont: I wanted to put bad people in jail.",
      "And after a conversation with Springer, he was also drawn to Danni's case.",
      "Tom Elfmont: She was a great kid. And the way she died \u2014 I get choked up about this a little bit, really, to this day, bothers me. And so, when they said, would you like to work the case? I said, \"yes, I wanna work the case.\"",
      "Stephanie Mollet: I, of course, internet stalked him immediately and came to find out that he's like the man that never retires.",
      "Tom Elfmont: I told Stephanie, \"I will solve this case, Stephanie.\" And she said, \"OK, I'm gonna trust you.\"",
      "And with Elfmont leading the way, he soon found a suspect.",
      "Rachelle Schrute: Why do I know that name? Like, that sounds so familiar. \u2026 it took a little bit of time for it to go, \"oh no, oh no.\" \u2026 Oh, my gosh, no way!",
      "AT LAST \u2013 A BREAK IN THE CASE",
      "By mid-2023, retired-LAPD Captain Tom Elfmont was back to working full-time, committed to finding Danni Houchins' killer.",
      "Tom Elfmont: The only reason I stayed in it was Danni.",
      "For Danni's sister, Stephanie Mollet, Elfmont's refreshing dedication, professionalism and enthusiasm was what the case had always needed.",
      "Peter Van Sant: What does Tom do?",
      "Stephanie Mollet: Tom got to work. Tom worked on Danni's case every day. He went through and reexamined all of the evidence.",
      "Elfmont had access to everything, including a list of potential suspects from the old case file and that previously tested clothing that Danni had been wearing when she was found.",
      "Stephanie Mollet: He most importantly made sure that DNA got tested.",
      "Elfmont asked the Montana State Crime Lab to use their newest technology to retest the semen on Danni's underwear. At last, a breakthrough: a partial DNA profile. But there were no matches to names in the case file, and when Elfmont compared it to CODIS \u2014 the vast federal digital repository of DNA samples from convicted felons \u2014",
      "Tom Elfmont: We didn't get any hits.",
      "But Elfmont was undeterred and decided to go a less conventional route. He turned to genetic genealogy, and investigative genealogist CeCe Moore.",
      "CeCe Moore: Since I started working with law enforcement in 2018, I've been able to help \u2026 solve over 325 cases.",
      "Moore is an expert at building out family trees from DNA samples using information from popular genealogy websites \u2013 bringing cold cases back to life. But to solve this case, Moore needed a special type of DNA profile. Problem was, they didn't have enough DNA from that semen.",
      "CeCe Moore: We have to start from scratch, which means there has to be remaining biological evidence for us to go back and retest using more advanced technology.",
      "Elfmont did have more evidence for retesting: four male hairs that had been found on Danni, which had been perfectly preserved for 27 years. They had never yielded any usable DNA because were \"rootless\" hairs \u2013 without any skin cells, but Elfmont asked around and connected with Astrea Forensics, a state-of-the-art private lab that's at the forefront of extracting DNA from previously unattainable genetic matter.",
      "As if there wasn't enough drama in this case, the first two hairs Astrea tested produced nothing useable.",
      "Peter Van Sant: So the last two hairs are examined, are they able to get a profile?",
      "Tom Elfmont: Yes. In the last hair. \u2026 Oh, I was so excited!",
      "It was a critical breakthrough. Elfmont got permission from a judge to compare this enhanced DNA profile to samples in popular genealogy databases, where people voluntarily submit their DNA profiles. By spring, 2024, Moore had what she needed to get to work.",
      "CeCe Moore: I'm looking for patterns, commonalities, overlaps, eventually common ancestors.",
      "Moore was able to identify the great grandparents on both sides of the suspect's family tree. She then found one marriage that proved decisive.",
      "CeCe Moore: The couple that I finally zeroed in on \u2026 they had a lot of children.",
      "Including three sons. Moore felt like she had to be close, but there was a problem.",
      "CeCe Moore: What was really confounding was that everybody lived in New Hampshire. \u2026 yet the mystery was what was the link to Montana?",
      "Moore scoured through the birth indexes, marriage certificates, and even the social media of those sons.",
      "CeCe Moore: When I finally got to the youngest son's Facebook page, he had posted that he moved to Bozeman, Montana on July 1st, 1996.",
      "Remember, Danni had been murdered in September 1996.",
      "CeCe Moore: And finally, all the pieces fell into place. \u2026 On May 1st, 2024, I called up the detectives to let them know that I believed I had identified Danni's killer.",
      "Finally, after nearly 28 years, it was now time for Elfmont to call Mollet and give her the momentous news.",
      "Stephanie Mollet: We've found Danni's killer, and he is alive, and we are going to make a case against him.",
      "The suspect was Paul Hutchinson, a married father of two, who, Elfmont soon learned, was widely known and respected in local hunting and fishing circles.",
      "Tom Elfmont: We learned that he's been working for the Bureau of Land Management in Dillon, Montana, for 22 years as a fisheries biologist. \u2026 He was a big outdoorsman, bow hunter, rifle hunter, fisherman, trapper.",
      "And, incredibly, it turned out Mollet's childhood friend, Rachelle Schrute knew Hutchinson. He was a trusted mentor who she had first met in the early 2000s.",
      "Rachelle Schrute: Paul came across as \u2026 just an under-the-radar person that \u2026 was always so kind of calm and quiet. \u2026 He was just so utterly unremarkable.",
      "\"I KNEW WE HAD HIM\"",
      "Stephanie Mollet had spent years dreaming of the day someone would be held responsible for her sister's murder. That day \u2014 that dream \u2014 seemed to be finally coming true.",
      "Stephanie Mollet: It was the moment at which I knew that everything I had put into my fight for my sister had been worth it.",
      "In September 1996, suspect Paul Hutchinson was 27 years old. He had served in the Marine Corps, then moved to Bozeman to study at Montana State University, just 13 miles from where Danni's body was discovered.",
      "Tom Elfmont: When he was at Montana State, he had a work-study \u2026 he worked for the Fish and Wildlife Service \u2026 which would have put him on the waterways around Belgrade.",
      "Peter Van Sant: Where on September 21st, 1996, Danni ended up on a hike.",
      "Tom Elfmont: That's correct.",
      "Peter Van Sant: Do you think your sister Danni knew Paul Hutchinson?",
      "Stephanie Mollet: No. Paul Hutchinson was a stranger to Danni. \u2026 there's no way that she would've known him.",
      "But many people in the area did know Hutchinson, through his passion for hunting and fishing and high-profile government job.",
      "Rachelle Schrute: He just was like this respected source of information in the hunting and fishing space.",
      "Schrute knew Hutchinson\u00a0for years. She's an expert hunter and former Yellowstone park guide \u2013 and is now the Hunt & Fish editor for GearJunkie.com.",
      "Rachelle Schrute: I think I would've considered him a \u2014 a friend. \u2026 you know if we were doing some sort of hunt camp, I would've not even thought twice about inviting him.",
      "Schrute says she never once questioned Hutchinson's integrity, even she went on fishing trips with him \u2014 just the two of them \u2014 out in the middle of nowhere.",
      "Rachelle Schrute: I've always trusted my gut instinct when it comes to \u2026 especially men. \u2026 I never had any feeling that he was unsafe.",
      "Though she hadn't seen Hutchinson in years, Schrute kept up with him online. He would often post on message boards about hunting trips he had taken across the country.",
      "Rachelle Schrute: Paul was super active in the hunting community. \u2026 It seemed like he was constantly hunting. \u2026 Always sharing where he was headed, or where he just got back from.",
      "Hutchinson had no criminal record. By all accounts, he had been leading a quiet existence since 1996.",
      "Peter Van Sant: And what did you know about his family life?",
      "Tom Elfmont: Well, we knew that he had a wife, a daughter, and a son.",
      "And he lived just a few hours away.",
      "Peter Van Sant: And Dillon, Montana, how far is that from Bozeman?",
      "Tom Elfmont: A hundred and forty miles.",
      "Elfmont knew he couldn't make an arrest until he got Hutchinson's DNA \u2014 which he was working out how to get. In the meantime, Montana law did allow Elfmont to talk to Hutchinson with some conditions.",
      "Tom Elfmont:\u00a0 It just basically has to be in a public area where he can walk away anytime he wants to.",
      "So, on July 23, 2024, Elfmont and another detective drove down to Hutchinson's office at the Bureau of Land Management in Dillon with a body camera rolling.",
      "Tom Elfmont: We saw Paul come in and get out of his pickup \u2026 and then we started walking up \u2026 And I got up about 10 feet from Paul and I said \u2013",
      "TOM ELFMONT (bodycam): Hey Paul. How are you doin?",
      "PAUL HUTCHINSON: Good.",
      "TOM ELFMONT: Good. My name's Tom Elfmont. \u2026 I'm with the Gallatin County Sheriff's Office.",
      "PAUL HUTCHINSON: Uh-huh.",
      "COURT DEPWEG: Hey, guys.",
      "They came ready with a clever excuse for why they wanted to speak with Hutchinson, hoping it wouldn't raise his suspicions.",
      "TOM ELFMONT (bodycam): We wanted to talk to you. \u2026 we've been talking to some fisheries people about some things that have been going on here at the rivers in Southwest Montana.",
      "PAUL HUTCHINSON: OK.",
      "Tom Elfmont: I explained to him that we're investigating some cases up and down the rivers \u2026 And so we wanna talk to people that are experts.",
      "Right at the start, they caught a break thanks to an unusually scorching hot day.",
      "Tom Elfmont: It was 98 that day in Dillon. He said, let's go inside.",
      "PAUL HUTCHINSON (bodycam): You guys wanna come inside and talk?",
      "COURT DEPWEG: That'd be great, man.",
      "Tom Elfmont: If he invites us in, we don't have to give him Miranda. So, we go inside, he takes us in a small conference room.",
      "While they didn't ask about Danni Houchins right away, Elfmont says he could tell Hutchinson was nervous.",
      "COURT DEPWEG (bodycam): So, I appreciate you \u2014 sitting down with us.",
      "PAUL HUTCHINSON: No, glad to help. Wha \u2014 What's up?",
      "Tom Elfmont: And he breaks into a sweat. It's just his head starts sweating. \u2026 And he asked, can I \u2014 can I leave?",
      "PAUL HUTCHINSON (bodycam): Um, can you gimme a second?",
      "COURT DEPWEG:\u00a0 Absolutely.",
      "Hutchinson said he had to go help a coworker. When he returned, they asked him about the other cases.",
      "Tom Elfmont: So I had pictures of four women that died; one in a river in Idaho, two over on the Yellowstone, and then Danni.",
      "Elfmont's partner, Court Depweg, took over the conversation.",
      "COURT DEPWEG (bodycam/shows photo of Danni): OK, this is Danielle Houchins.",
      "PAUL HUTCHINSON: Mm-hmm.",
      "COURT DEPWEG: She was \u2014 she was killed in September of 96.",
      "PAUL HUTCHINSON: OK. \u2026",
      "COURT DEPWEG: And she was found \u2026 off the Gallatin River. Did you ever fish up there?",
      "PAUL HUTCHINSON: I trapped on the Gallatin. \u2026",
      "COURT DEPWEG: Have you ever heard of the Cameron Bridge Access?",
      "PAUL HUTCHINSON: Mm-hmm. (Nods to affirm)",
      "COURT DEPWEG: Have you been there before?",
      "PAUL HUTCHINSON: Probably, um, Jackrabbit Lane?",
      "COURT DEPWEG: Yeah.",
      "PAUL HUTCHINSON: Yeah.",
      "COURT DEPWEG: Exactly.",
      "Hutchinson had confirmed he had not only been to the remote area where Danni was attacked, he remembered the street that led there. Elfmont says it was a revealing exchange.",
      "Tom Elfmont: He's shaking. He's all distressed now. \u2026 he was sitting back in the chair \u2026 as far as he could get from the table and the pictures. \u2026 I knew we had him.",
      "COURT DEPWEG (bodycam): Do you remember seeing her there? Or a \u2014 a similar face?",
      "PAUL HUTCHINSON: Um - I honestly don't. I \u2014 I mean, I probably \u2014 I've been to a bunch of fishing access sites for one reason or another.",
      "Hutchinson denied knowing anything about Danni's death \u2014 even when they told him they had the suspect's DNA.",
      "COURT DEPWEG (bodycam): Is there a possibility that you were there when she was murdered?",
      "PAUL HUTCHINSON: No. \u2026",
      "COURT DEPWEG: You weren't trapping or anything during that time?",
      "PAUL HUTCHINSON: Not in September. I would've been, you know \u2014 Are you \u2014 are you asking me? I mean \u2014",
      "COURT DEPWEG: I'm just asking if you remember anything \u2013",
      "PAUL HUTCHINSON: Oh, oh.",
      "COURT DEPWEG: \u2014 during that time?",
      "PAUL HUTCHINSON: No, no.",
      "Peter Van Sant: Did you ever directly say, \"did you kill Danni Houchins?\"",
      "Tom Elfmont: No.",
      "Peter Van Sant: Why?",
      "Tom Elfmont: Didn't need to. \u2026 Didn't need to. And \u2014",
      "Peter Van Sant: 'Cause he knows that you know.",
      "Tom Elfmont: That's right. Yeah.",
      "Peter Van Sant: And you know that he knows that you know.",
      "Tom Elfmont: Correct.",
      "As they wrapped up the interview, Hutchinson had a question for them.",
      "PAUL HUTCHINSON (bodycam): Anything else you want to ask me while I'm here?",
      "TOM ELFMONT: No, we're good. We're good now.",
      "To Elfmont, it seemed like Hutchinson couldn't believe they didn't arrest him. But the investigation was far from over.",
      "Tom Elfmont: So we walk out of the building and we had surveillance people to follow him. \u2026 He started driving like a maniac. \u2026 High speed, doing U-turns. \u2026 and he takes off.",
      "A SISTER'S PROMISE FULFILLED",
      "With the possibility of an arrest of her sister's killer, Stephanie began imagining what justice would look like for Paul Hutchinson.",
      "Stephanie Mollet: I was preparing myself for the next three to five years of a court battle to \u2026 staring him down, to being present every day in that courtroom.",
      "But what Mollet could never prepare herself for was the startling phone call she got from Elfmont just 12 hours after he had interviewed Hutchinson.",
      "Tom Elfmont: So I called Stephanie \u2026 And I said, \"Stephanie ... (long pause) he's dead, he killed himself. \u2026 It's a big pause. And she said, \"you know, I don't know how I feel about that.\" I said, \"I get it. I understand.\"",
      "Police say Hutchinson drove to a remote area and called the sheriff's dispatch line, saying an officer needed help.",
      "When cops arrived, they found Hutchinson's body \u2014 dead by a self-inflicted gunshot wound. He was 55.",
      "Peter Van Sant: Give me a sense of that moment for you.",
      "Stephanie Mollet: Shock. I \u2014 I didn't expect that to happen.",
      "When Hutchinson's DNA was checked against evidence from Danni's body, including the semen on her underwear, there was match.",
      "Tom Elfmont: The ratio? 10.7 trillion-to-one. So he was the guy.",
      "Peter Van Sant: This case is solved.",
      "Tom Elfmont: A hundred percent.",
      "Mollet's friend, Rachelle Schrute \u2014 who had considered Hutchinson a mentor \u2014 learned what happened as she watched the sheriff's news conference.",
      "Rachelle Schrute: I am gutted. I've known him most of my life. \u2026 Like, it makes me mad to know him. \u2026 How dare you!",
      "At the news conference Mollet thanked the current sheriff's team.",
      "STEPHANIE MOLLET (to reporters): I'd like to express my family's gratitude to Tom Elfmont for overcoming every roadblock ... To Dan Springer, thank you for being a man of your word.",
      "And then, she did what no one there expected. She unleashed years of pent-up anger.",
      "STEPHANIE MOLLET (to reporters): The sheriff \u2026 lied to my parents \u2026 bold-face lied and betrayed the trust of shocked and grieving parents. \u2026 those institutions failed my sister, failed my family, and failed this community.\"",
      "\"48 Hours\" asked Springer about Mollet's allegations that the sheriff's department, for years, had lied to her family.",
      "Peter Van Sant: If what they say is true, were they lied to?",
      "Sheriff Dan Springer: I don't \u2014 I \u2014 I don't know what they said, to be honest.",
      "Peter Van Sant: What the parents said is that they were told that their daughter did not have any injuries. \u2026 If what they are saying is true \u2014",
      "Sheriff Dan Springer: Yeah.",
      "Peter Van Sant: \u2014 were they lied to?",
      "Sheriff Dan Springer: Oh, of course. I mean, I think the \u2014 the reports speak for themselves, there were marks on her body and if that's what they were told, then that's not the truth.",
      "\"48 Hours\" reached out to the man who was sheriff in 1996, Bill Slaughter, now retired. Slaughter admits withholding some information from Danni's family, but claims he never lied to them despite the fact he told the local newspaper in 1996 that there was no indication of foul play.",
      "Weeks after the news conference, Mollet went back to the scene of the crime.",
      "Stephanie Mollet: When I finally saw the exact spot where her body was found and I sat there and imagined that, about her last moments and how it went from peaceful rusting of leaves and, you know, the sounds of squirrels running through the forest and the birds chirping to suddenly turning to this awful and violating and terrifying experience \u2026 And then that realization that she must have had when he was holding her face down in the mud, that she was gonna die right there. \u2026 And I am so sorry for her, that she had to experience that moment.",
      "Peter Van Sant: For you, what is this case about?",
      "Tom Elfmont:\u00a0 Danni. It's about Danni. \u2026 I would wake up at night, and I would say, middle of the night, 3 o'clock in the morning, and I'd say, \"Danni, I got you.\" It's about Danni.",
      "the most troubling, says Elfmont, \u00a0\"were there other victims?\"",
      "Tom Elfmont: Oh, I think there's a good possibility. Yeah.",
      "Stephanie Mollet: I think that anyone who is able to rape and murder a young girl and then get away with it for almost 28 years had plenty of chances to do it again.",
      "Mollet is now trying to make changes in how Montana funds and supervises law enforcement, so that cases like Danni's don't fall by the wayside.",
      "Stephanie Mollet: On the table, I have \u2026 what was in Danni's pocket when she died. \u2026 And then her driver's license, which she was really proud of having.",
      "Years ago, Danni's family spread some of her ashes on a nearby mountain top.",
      "Stephanie Mollet: We spread half of Danni's ashes on top of the tallest mountain on the Bridger Range, Sacagawea Peak.",
      "And now, almost 30 years later, Stephanie was back on the banks of the Gallatin River, where Danni died to spread the last of her ashes \u2026 and to tell her sister that she'd made a difference.",
      "Stephanie Mollet: I love you Danni.",
      "Stephanie Mollet: I think the biggest thing has been, after so many years of begging and pleading for people to pay attention to my sister, for people to believe that she mattered. I'm feeling so often like I was screaming into an echo chamber. Now, suddenly she matters to everyone all over again.",

      "THE DISAPPEARANCE OF MOLLY BISH",
      "The last time Heather Bish saw her little sister Molly was the morning of June 27, 2000 \u2013 just before Molly left for her job as a lifeguard at Comins Pond in Warren, Massachusetts. Molly was playing with Heather's 11-month-old daughter Mikaela.",
      "Heather Bish: She was \u2026 having fun with Mikaela and I remember my mom saying, come on we gotta go, we gotta go, you're gonna be late.",
      "But shortly after Molly was dropped off, beachgoers arrived and she wasn't there. Police were eventually called to the scene. By the time they told Magi Bish, Molly had been missing for three hours.",
      "Heather Bish: And my mom was frantic on the phone \u2026",
      "Heather Bish: She's said, she's not there, she's not there \u2026 her shoes are there. \u2026 My heart dropped. I just knew something was wrong because I knew Molly wouldn't go anywhere without her shoes on.",
      "Erin Moriarty: Why?",
      "Heather Bish: Because she didn't like icky feet.",
      "Erin Moriarty: When you first heard that she was missing, did you think maybe she had gone off with friends?",
      "John Bish Jr.: No.",
      "John Jr. is Molly Bish's brother.",
      "John Bish Jr.: Not what we do. \u2026 It's not our personality, our character. We were raised better than that.",
      "Sixteen-year-old Molly was Magi and John Bish's third and youngest child. \"48 Hours\" interviewed John Bish Sr. in 2003.",
      "John Bish Sr.: She was heavily involved in school, with sports, with her friends.",

      "Heather Bish: Molly was just very loud and fun.",

      "Heather Bish: Molly was five seven you know, she was athletic and in shape and strong.",
      "So when police suggested that Molly could have drowned, they didn't believe it.",
      "Magi Bish: When Molly went missing, I mean we\u2014 it was inconceivable. \u2026 And then, what I was told was, the first aid kit was open.",
      "Adding to the mystery \u2026 the police radio was there, but Molly had not used it for her required morning check in.",
      "Magi Bish: Why? So what was, what happened?",
      "Later that afternoon, when it became clear to local police that Molly had not just walked off with friends, State Police took over the investigation and launched an extensive search.",
      "Massachusetts State Police Lieutenant Colonel Dan Richard headed to Warren to help out.",
      "Det. Dan Richard: I had a 3-year-old daughter. Her name is Molly. She had blonde hair, she has blue eyes. This case has every day been with me from that day to today.",
      "Also present at the scene was then Worcester District Attorney John Conte.",
      "Detectives zeroed in on everyone who was close to Molly \u2014 including family members, friends and Molly's boyfriend, Steven Lukas. They had only been dating for three months and had just gone to the prom together.",

      "Kathy Curran: Could a young kid pull off this crime in such a short amount of time \u2026",

      "D.A. JOHN CONTE (to reporters in 2000): We've looked at, uh, 35 to 45, uh, sex offenders, uh, in the area.",
      "Heather Bish: That's been the scariest part about all this is realizing how many bad people were within the fabric of our, of our community.",
      "Molly's dad worked tirelessly with police.",
      "Heather Bish: He was always going every weekend trying to work with police and trying to find different ways to, to find Molly.",
      "And despite the fact that DNA testing was still in its early stages back in 2000, Detective Richard says they did collect and document many items found in and around the pond area, including discarded cigarettes and trash.",
      "Det. Dan Richard: When we did the initial search \u2026 anything that wasn't there by nature or by God was at least identified as, as potential evidence.",
      "As the days went by the Bishes' despair grew.",
      "Heather Bish: It wasn't like Molly was hit by a car or got sick. She was just suddenly gone and we didn't know where she was \u2026",
      "But it would be Magi Bish who would give detectives their biggest lead.",
      "The morning before Molly disappeared, as Magi went to drop Molly off at work at Comins Pond, she recalled seeing a man, sitting alone in a white car.",
      "Magi Bish: And I see this guy \u2026 and he's just smoking a cigarette and he just gives me a \u2014 like a little look and I say oh I can't leave her here. \u2026 \u00a0you know it's like the Mama Bear comes out.",
      "Magi says she waited for 20 minutes until he finally left. When she brought it up with Molly that evening, Molly didn't seem concerned.",
      "Magi Bish: She says, \"Oh no, Ma, it's just fishermen, don't be \u2014 I'm not afraid.\"",
      "The next day, when Molly disappeared, Magi told the police about what she had seen.",
      "Det. Dan Richard: That became very significant \u2026 because now we had a piece of information.",
      "A sketch was composed based on Magi's description and it was released to the public.",
      "D.A. CONTE (to reporters in 2000 holding up a sketch): This is the individual that we're looking for, uh, in that white car.",
      "Magi Bish: I had seen the hair. It was gray. It was very thick. \u2026 It's just that smoking (she signals with her hands) you know that doggone smoking. That's what I remembered.",
      "Almost immediately, hundreds of tips started flooding in.",
      "Det. Dan Richard: If you were a \u2014 a 50-year-old white male with a mustache and salt and pepper hair, somebody may have, uh, wanted to give us a call.",
      "Many months later, authorities released a second, different sketch.",
      "D.A. CONTE (to reporters in 2000): I believe that this sketch is a remarkable sketch and it's very distinctive and I think it's gonna help us a great deal.",
      "But still no Molly.",

You get 'em under oath and there's a criminal penalty if they lie in the grand jury. \u2026 and they can't say later, I didn't say that because it's right there. ..

      "Although tight-lipped about the details, the Worcester D.A.'s office was confident that Sumner was a viable suspect and planned to compare his DNA to DNA found at the crime scenes.

      "Erin Moriarty: You know that the Bishes have been frustrated. They don't feel they're getting enough information from your office. They wanna know is the DNA being preserved properly, what kind of DNA?",
      "D.A. Joe Early Jr.: As a general rule of thumb, no matter what family it is, the Bishes, uh, other families that we have, we just don't share the information because \u2026 someone might say something they just shouldn't say and it can compromise the entire case.",
      "However, he says DNA is just one piece of the puzzle.",

      "The case, known as Trump v. Slaughter, arose from Mr. Trump's move to fire Rebecca Kelly Slaughter from her post at the Federal Trade Commission without cause, despite a federal statute that limits a commissioner's removal to instances of inefficiency, neglect of duty or malfeasance in office.",
      "Now, the high court is set to decide whether those removal protections for members of the FTC violate the separation of powers, and whether it should overturn a landmark 1935 decision in a case called Humphrey's Executor v. United States.",
      "The legal battle is the culmination of a yearslong weakening of Humphrey's Executor by the court's conservative justices. In that 90-year-old ruling, which involved President Franklin Roosevelt's attempt to remove a member of the Federal Trade Commission, the high court allowed Congress to shield certain independent agency members from being removed by the president at will.",
      "But in several recent decisions, the conservative justices have chipped away at the precedent. Most recently, it ended removal protections for officials at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau in 2020 and the Federal Housing Finance Agency in 2021.",
      "Since Mr. Trump returned to the White House for a second term, he has sought to expand the bounds of presidential power and moved to fire a swath of Democratic-appointed members of independent boards and commissions.",
      "Trump's firing of Slaughter",
      "Slaughter was among the victims of the president's campaign to \"reclaim power from this unaccountable bureaucracy.\" Appointed to the FTC by Mr. Trump in his first term and reappointed by Biden, she received an email in March with a message from the president informing her that her \"continued service on the FTC is inconsistent with my Administration's priorities.\"",
      "The president's move to fire Slaughter and a fellow Democratic commissioner, Alvaro M. Bedoya, left the FTC with only three commissioners, who were all Republicans.",
      "Slaughter, like many other independent agency leaders fired by Mr. Trump, sued to get her job back and argued that her removal was illegal. When Congress established the FTC in 1914, it said commissioners could be removed by the president only for inefficiency, neglect of duty or malfeasance in office. But Mr. Trump had not followed the law, she argued.",
      "A federal district court ruled in her favor, finding that Slaughter's removal was unlawful. It ordered her to be reinstated to her job at the FTC. But that decision was the first in a series of re-hirings and re-firings. Days after Slaughter prevailed before the district court, the U.S. appeals court in Washington, D.C., issued a temporary order allowing her removal. Weeks after that, the appeals court said Slaughter should be reinstated once again.",
      "Then, when the Trump administration sought emergency relief from the Supreme Court, Chief Justice John Roberts cleared the way for her firing. The high court agreed in late September to hear the case and continued to keep her out of her post while it considers whether the removal protections for members of the trade commission violate the separation of powers.",
      "What's at stake",
      "That issue, and the fate of its 1935 precedent, will be before the high court Monday, when the justices convene for arguments.",
      "\"It's very likely the Supreme Court is going to say that in order for the president to be able to do his job, to take care that the laws are faithfully executed, he has to have control of the people helping him execute those laws,\" said Brian Fitzpatrick, a professor at Vanderbilt University Law School.",
      "The Supreme Court's decision could have significant ramifications for the structure of the federal government and curtail Congress' power to impose limits on the president's removal power.",
      "\"The president is supposed to have certain powers that are separated from the legislative branch, and if the legislative branch goes in there and says we're going to interfere with your powers by saying you're not allowed to remove these people, that's a violation of the separation of powers,\" Fitzpatrick said.",
      "The Trump administration argued that the Constitution vests all executive power in the president and therefore grants him \"illimitable\" authority over officers who wield that power on his behalf. In a filing with the Supreme Court, Solicitor General D. John Sauer said that removal protections for members of independent agencies leave the president \"saddled with subordinate officers\" who prevent him from ensuring that the laws are faithfully executed.",
      "While Congress' power to structure the executive branch allows it to establish and organize departments under the president, it does not allow lawmakers \"to establish a Fourth Branch that siphons executive power away from the chief executive's control,\" Sauer wrote.",
      "Congress has created more than two dozen independent agencies that regulate many aspects of American life, from nuclear waste to telemarketing to consumer products, with removal protections that seek to shield their members from political pressure.",
      "In its 1935 decision in Humphrey's Executor, the Supreme Court recognized an exception to the president's removal power for multi-member agencies with quasi-legislative or quasi-judicial powers. The high court found that the FTC fit within those parameters, and its commissioners could therefore only be removed for cause.",
      "But the Trump administration argued that the trade commission of today is different from the agency of 90 years ago because it has amassed executive powers. The modern FTC executes more than 80 federal laws and regulates a broad range of matters, from meat products to contact lenses to credit cards, Sauer wrote.",
      "Additionally, the FTC can now file civil suits seeking monetary penalties, make substantive rules, issue final orders in agency adjudications and investigate potential violations, he said.",
      "\"The notion that some agencies that exercise executive power can be sequestered from presidential control seriously offends the Constitution's structure and the liberties that the separation of powers protects,\" Sauer wrote.",
      "Impacts of the court's decision",
      "If the Supreme Court invalidates the removal protections for FTC commissioners, such a decision is likely to reach far beyond the commission.",
      "Because many statutes restrict a president to removing an official for inefficiency, neglect of duty and malfeasance in office, Fitzpatrick predicted the high court will \"say those words are an unconstitutional restriction on the president so all the other agencies with those words will be in the same boat.\"",
      "Lawyers for Slaughter, meanwhile, warned of the broad impacts of a decision overturning the Supreme Court's 1935 decision, writing in a filing that doing so would destabilize institutions that have been woven into the fabric of U.S. governance.",
      "\"Multimember independent agencies are deeply ingrained in our Nation's history and tradition, from the First Congress to the present day,\" they said. \"That history confirms that they are fully compatible with our Constitution's text and structure.\"",
      "Slaughter's legal team argued that the Trump administration is asking the Supreme Court to transfer new powers to the president that Congress chose not to give him and wants courts to \"jettison longstanding laws enacted by the people's elected representatives.\"",
      "They also said the current structure of multimember independent agencies \u2014 composed of members from both parties who serve for staggered terms and are insulated from political shifts \u2014 leads to \"more modest actions\" and therefore protects individual liberty better than an agency helmed by a single person.",
      "\"What the statutory protection for a member's tenure guarantees is that a political minority, the minority party, will always be represented in deliberations, which is at the very least an important watchdog function,\" said Peter Shane, a legal scholar at New York University School of Law.",
      "He continued: \"But the other thing is it prevents presidents from sabotaging agencies and sabotaging the congressional design, either by eliminating from the agency members of the minority party, or enough members so that an agency lacks a quorum to function at all.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has already attempted to make his mark on the Merit Systems Protection Board, which protects the rights of government workers. The president fired one of its members, Cathy Harris, in February, leaving the MSPB without a quorum between April and October.",
      "\"A president opposed to the statutory mission of an agency can entirely kneecap it by depriving it of a quorum, and the president can certainly deprive it of genuine bipartisanship by refusing to fill the seats that would belong to the minority party,\" Shane said. \"The minority signaling function is quite important and it has multiple audiences, including the majority on a particular commission. But it also includes journalists, the general public and the courts.\"",
      "Slaughter's lawyers argued that even with protections in place for leaders of independent agencies, presidents can still exert influence over them through the candidates they nominate and the chair they select, as well as through recommending or vetoing spending bills that affect agency operations.",
      "A key issue for the court will be how it characterizes the powers that an agency wields. When the Supreme Court earlier this year allowed Mr. Trump to fire members of the National Labor Relations Board and the MSPB, it suggested in an unsigned order that the agencies \"exercise considerable executive power.\" A divided panel of three judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit ruled Friday that removal protections for the two labor boards are unconstitutional and said Congress cannot restrict the president's ability to remove their members.",
      "Mr. Trump has also\u00a0attempted to fire\u00a0a member of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, Lisa Cook. But the Supreme Court has so far allowed her to remain in her role, and the justices will\u00a0hear arguments on the case next month.",
      "\"All the agencies these days have a lot of powers, adjudicatory powers, rule-making powers, enforcement powers,\" Fitzpatrick said. \"I suspect no matter how they do it, all the independent agencies with the exception of the Fed are going to be under the president's thumb.\"",
      "But more than 200 members of Congress argued that multimember boards that are protected from at-will removal represent a longstanding compromise between the legislative and executive branches that should not be upset by the judicial branch. Invalidating for-cause removal protections would have drastic consequences for the structure and operation of the federal government, they wrote in a friend-of-the-court brief.",
      "\"[A]t-will removals of commissioners of independent agencies would lead regulated entities and the public to believe that the President is able to pick winners and losers in the American economy through intervening in individual cases,\" they said. \"That would detrimentally alter the way the public interacts with these regulators, and, consequently, the economic choices the regulators make.\"",

      "Officers at Naha Airport on Japan's southern island of Okinawa arrested Harris on Nov. 16 for an alleged violation of customs law for having 0.78 grams, or 0.0275 ounces, of the crystalized drug, also known as MDMA, in a container in a tote bag he was carrying, according to Okinawa Regional Customs spokesperson Tatsunori Fukuda.",
      "Harris, 36, had left London's Heathrow Airport two days earlier and transited in Taiwan's Taoyuan International Airport before arriving in Naha for sightseeing, Fukuda said. Okinawa is a popular resort destination with mild weather throughout the year.",
      "Fukuda said Harris was arrested on the spot and taken into custody by the Tomishiro police, which filed a criminal complaint to the Naha District Prosecutors' Office on Thursday for further investigation and possible indictment.

    "story": [
      "President Trump on Saturday presented the 2025 Kennedy Center honorees with their medals during a ceremony in the Oval Office, hailing the slate of artists he was deeply involved in choosing as \"perhaps the most accomplished and renowned class\" ever assembled.",
      "This year's recipients are actor Sylvester Stallone, singers Gloria Gaynor and George Strait, the rock band Kiss and actor-singer Michael Crawford.",
      "Mr. Trump said they are a group of \"incredible people\" who represent the \"very best in American arts and culture\" and that, \"I know most of them and I've been a fan of all of them.\"",
      "\"This is a group of icons whose work and accomplishments have inspired, uplifted and unified millions and millions of Americans,\" said a tuxedo-clad Mr. Trump. \"This is perhaps the most accomplished and renowned class of Kennedy Center Honorees ever assembled.\"",
      "Mr. Trump ignored the Kennedy Center and its premier awards program during his first term as president. But the Republican has instituted a series of changes\u00a0since returning to office in January, most notably ousting its board of trustees and replacing them with GOP supporters who voted him in as chair of the board. That triggered a number of artists to\u00a0cancel performances and some staff members resigned.",
      "The changes were instituted after the White House\u00a0accused the institution\u00a0of being \"woke\" and scrutinized its finances earlier this year.",
      "The president placed around each honoree's neck a new medal that was designed, created and donated by jeweler Tiffany & Co., according to the Kennedy Center and Mr. Trump.",
      "It's a gold disc etched on one side with the Kennedy Center's image and rainbow colors. The honoree's name appears on the reverse side with the date of the ceremony. The medallion hangs from a navy blue ribbon and replaces a large rainbow ribbon decorated with three gold plates that rested on the honoree's shoulders and chest.",
      "Strait, wearing a cowboy hat, was first to receive his medal. When the country singer started to take off the hat, Mr. Trump said, \"If you want to leave it on, you can. I think we can get it through.\" But Strait took it off.",
      "The president said Crawford was a \"great star of Broadway\" for his lead role in the long-running \"Phantom of the Opera.\" Of Gaynor, he said, \"We have the disco queen, and she was indeed, and nobody did it like Gloria Gaynor.\"",
      "Mr. Trump was effusive about his friend Stallone, calling him a \"wonderful\" and \"spectacular\" person and \"one of the true, great movie stars\" and \"one of the great legends.\"",
      "Kiss is an \"incredible rock band,\" he said.",
      "Songs by honorees Gaynor and Kiss played in the Rose Garden just outside the Oval Office as members of the White House press corps waited nearby for Mr. Trump to begin the ceremony.",
      "The president said in August that he was \"about 98% involved\" in choosing the 2025 honorees when he personally announced them at the Kennedy Center, the first slate chosen under his leadership. The honorees traditionally had been announced by press release.",
      "It was unclear how they were chosen. Before Mr. Trump, it fell to a bipartisan selection committee.",
      "\"These are among the greatest artists, actors and performers of their generation. The greatest that we've seen,\" Mr. Trump said. \"We can hardly imagine the country music phenomena without its king of country, or American disco without its first lady, or Broadway without its phantom \u2014 and that was a phantom, let me tell you \u2014 or rock and roll without its hottest band in the world, and that's what they are, or Hollywood without one of its greatest visionaries.\"",
      "\"Each of you has made an indelible mark on American life and together you have defined entire genres and set new standards for the performing arts,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "Mr. Trump was also attending an annual State Department dinner for the honorees on Saturday. In years past, the honorees received their medallions there but Trump moved the ceremony to the White House.",
      "Meanwhile, the glitzy Kennedy Center Honors program and its series of tribute speeches and performances for each recipient is set to be taped on Sunday at the performing arts center for broadcast later in December on CBS and Paramount+. Mr. Trump is to attend the program for the first time as president, accompanied by his wife, first lady Melania Trump.",
      "The president said in August that he had agreed to host the show, and he seemed to confirm on Saturday that he would do so, predicting that the broadcast would garner its highest ratings ever as a result. Presidents traditionally attend the program and sit with the honorees in the audience. None has ever served as host.",
      "He said he looked forward to Sunday's celebration.",
      "\"It's going to be something that I believe, and I'm going to make a prediction: this will be the highest-rated show that they've ever done and they've gotten some pretty good ratings, but there's nothing like what's going to happen tomorrow night,\" Mr. Trump said.",

De Paul got it in stride, pushed it into the far corner of the net \u2014 and Messi went airborne to hop into his arms a few seconds later, all smiles.",
      "And as the final minutes ticked away, Inter Miami's pink-clad fans \u2014 most wearing Messi's No. 10 on their backs \u2014 stood and stomped and cheered. South Florida has seen NFL and NBA and Major League Baseball and NHL titles in the past.",

    "story": [
      "Two people who survived the U.S. military's early September strike on an alleged drug-carrying vessel were attempting to climb back onto the boat before it was hit a second time, a source familiar with the matter told CBS News on Wednesday.",
      "The survivors allegedly tried to salvage some of the drugs, according to the source. They appeared to be in communication with others at the time, and there were other boats in the vicinity that could have picked them up, the head of Special Operations Command Admiral Mitch Bradley was expected to tell lawmakers on Thursday, the source said.",
      "ABC News was first to report the additional details on the strike. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth reposted a video of ABC News' report on X.",
      "The Sept. 2 mission \u2014 the first of more than 20 attacks on alleged drug boats by the Trump administration in recent months \u2014 has drawn bipartisan scrutiny since last week, when The Washington Post reported that the military carried out at least two strikes on the same boat in the Caribbean, killing a pair of survivors from the initial hit. The newspaper alleged in its report that the second strike was conducted because Hegseth had said that everybody on board the boat should be killed.",
      "The White House confirmed this week that there was a second strike, but denied that Hegseth ordered it. Hegseth has said the decision was made by Bradley, the mission's commander, and argued the follow-up strike was legal and justified.",
      "Bradley and Gen. Dan Caine, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, walked lawmakers through a video of the second strike in classified testimony on Thursday before the House and Senate Armed Services and Intelligence committees. Bradley testified that Hegseth didn't issue an order for everybody to be killed, multiple lawmakers later told reporters.",
      "Members of Congress offered divergent views on the video. Democratic Rep. Jim Himes of Connecticut called it \"one of the most troubling things I've seen in my time in public service,\" describing the two survivors as people \"in clear distress\" who were \"not in the position to continue their mission in any way.\" But Republican Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas said he \"didn't see anything disturbing about it,\" adding the survivors appeared to be \"trying to flip a boat loaded with drugs bound for the United States back over so they could stay in the fight.\"",
      "Democrats and some legal experts have alleged the second strike may have constituted a war crime under U.S. and international law if the military targeted survivors. A Pentagon manual on the law of war says \"wounded, sick, or shipwrecked\" combatants no longer pose a threat and should not be attacked.",
      "Even before the recent revelations, the campaign of boat strikes had drawn broader legal questions, with critics arguing the president doesn't have the authority to order military operations against alleged traffickers without congressional approval. In the past, the U.S. has typically sought to interdict drug smugglers at sea, essentially treating them like criminals rather than combatants. The Trump administration has argued the strikes are lawful because the U.S. is engaged in a \"non-international armed conflict\" with drug cartels that it views as terrorist organizations.",

    "title": "Trump thinks tariff revenue could replace income taxes. Is that possible?",
    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-cutting-income-tax-tariff-revenue/",
    "published": "Thu, 04 Dec 2025 15:14:11 -0500",
    "summary": "President Trump suggested Americans won't have to pay personal income taxes \"in the not-too-distant future\" because of rising U.S. tariffs.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump is floating an idea that could appeal to millions of budget-strained households: using tariff revenue to reduce, or even eliminate, the federal individual income tax. But tax experts are skeptical that import taxes could completely replace income tax, and they say a reduction in income taxes would largely benefit the nation's top earners.",
      "\"I believe that at some point in the not-too-distant future, you won't even have income tax to pay because the money we're taking in is so great,\" Mr. Trump said at a Dec. 2 Cabinet meeting, referring to the tariff revenues generated by the wide-ranging duties his administration has imposed on imports.",
      "Mr. Trump's suggestion comes as the Supreme Court is weighing the constitutionality of his tariffs, which are import taxes paid by U.S. companies that are typically passed partly on to American consumers in the form of higher prices. The Treasury Department this year has significantly boosted the country's collection of tariffs, thanks to Mr. Trump's policies.",
      "White House spokesman Kush Desai said in a statement that Mr. Trump \"is set to raise trillions in revenue for the federal government in the coming years with his tariffs \u2014 whose costs will ultimately be paid by the foreign exporters who rely on the American economy, the world's biggest and best consumer market.\"",
      "Despite the jump in tariff receipts, tax experts are skeptical that such revenue could ever replace individual income taxes.",
      "\"It is mechanically impossible to fully replace income tax revenues with tariffs,\" Erica York, vice president of federal tax policy at the Tax Foundation, a nonpartisan think tank, told CBS News. \"Any real attempt to do so would harm working-class Americans, damage the U.S. economy and significantly increase the federal budget deficit.\"",
      "York estimated the Trump administration's current tariff policy, assuming it remains in place, would generate about $2.1 trillion in revenue over the next decade. By comparison, federal individual income taxes would provide more than 10 times that amount, at $32 trillion over the same period, she said.",
      "Personal taxes provide about $2.7 trillion annually in federal revenue, according to IRS data. For fiscal year 2025, the U.S. generated $195 billion in tariff revenue, Treasury data\u00a0shows.",
      "\"Tariffs, even applied maximally, simply could not generate that level of revenue \u2014 imports are not a large enough tax base,\" York said.",
      "To be sure, tariff revenue could be used to provide a tax cut, said Scott Lincicome, vice president of general economics at the nonpartisan Cato Institute. However, because low-income households already pay little to no income tax, it's unlikely to help the families most in need of a financial boost, he noted.",
      "\"If they did a flat 3% reduction in income tax, the only people who would really benefit are the top 10%\" of income earners, Lincicome said.",
      "The top 10% of earners pay about 72% of the nation's income taxes, according to Tax Foundation data.",
      "What about a tariff dividend?",
      "Mr. Trump has also discussed the possibility of sending Americans a $2,000 \"tariff dividend\" check, an idea he reiterated during the Dec. 2 Cabinet meeting.",
      "Yet that proposal also faces a troublesome math problem, Lincicome said. Sending a one-time $2,000 payment to U.S. households would cost between $300 billion and $600 billion \u2014 far more than the U.S. is currently collecting in tariffs, he pointed out.",
      "Issuing a tariff payment or reducing income taxes also would require Congress to change the tax code \u2014 a tall legislative task given the ongoing partisanship in Congress. Some Republican lawmakers have already rebuffed the idea of a $2,000 payment, with Sen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin recently\u00a0saying\u00a0the U.S. \"can't afford\" it.",
      "Meanwhile, the U.S. is unlikely to raise enough tariff revenue to fund dividend checks or replace the individual income tax because that would require import taxes so high that Americans would stop buying most imported goods, causing tariff revenue to collapse, Lincicome explained.",
      "\"There is a hard cap on the amount of money you can raise with tariffs,\" he added. Economists \"say you can maybe raise $700 billion a year, which would be a very high effective tax rate \u2014 an across-the-board 20% to 30% tariff rate \u2014 but if it's pushed above that, nobody would buy imports.\"",
      "The overall average effective tariff rate facing U.S. consumers is now nearly 17%, the highest level since 1935, according to the\u00a0Yale Budget Lab, a nonpartisan policy research center.",
      "How do tariffs differ from income taxes?",
      "Setting aside the difference in the scale of revenue collection, tariffs are structured differently from income taxes. U.S. companies that import products, parts and other goods from abroad pay a fee based on the country of origin \u2014 for instance, American firms pay a 15% tariff on imports from the European Union.",
      "That means an American company importing a $5 Italian chocolate bar would pay the U.S. government an additional 75 cents, and then decide whether to pass that extra cost on to consumers or absorb it.",
      "Because of their structure, tariffs are often compared with sales taxes, where sellers pay a percentage of an item's cost when they check out at a store.",
      "By contrast, individual income taxes are progressive, meaning lower-income Americans pay a smaller tax rate than higher-earning households. The lowest bracket is 10%, while the top rate is 37%.",
      "Replacing the graduated income tax with a flat tariff rate would likely leave low- and middle-income households shouldering a bigger share of the burden than higher-income earners, York said.",

    "published": "Wed, 03 Dec 2025 21:49:00 -0500",
    "summary": "The former officials said the FDA's plans to revamp how certain life-saving vaccines are handled would \"disadvantage the people the FDA exists to protect, including millions of Americans at high risk from serious infections.\"",
    "story": [
      "A dozen prior leaders of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration \u2014 appointed by Republicans and Democrats alike \u2014 issued a scathing denunciation of new FDA assertions casting doubt on vaccine safety.",
      "The former officials said the agency's plans to revamp how life-saving vaccines for flu, COVID-19 and other respiratory diseases are handled \u2014 outlined in an internal FDA memo last week \u2014 would \"disadvantage the people the FDA exists to protect, including millions of Americans at high risk from serious infections.\"",
      "\"The proposed new directives are not small adjustments or coherent policy updates. They represent a major shift in the FDA's understanding of its job,\" the officials, former FDA commissioners and acting commissioners, wrote Wednesday in The New England Journal of Medicine.",
      "The internal memo by FDA vaccine chief Dr. Vinay Prasad hasn't been publicly released. The memo said a review \"found that at least 10 children have died after and because of receiving COVID-19 vaccination,\" multiple sources familiar with it told CBS News on Saturday.",
      "Prasad suggested that the deaths were related to myocarditis, or the inflammation of the heart muscle, the sources said. Prasad did not share any data used in the review, including the children's ages, whether they had existing health conditions, or how the FDA determined there was a link between their death and the vaccine. The findings were not published in a peer-reviewed medical journal.",
      "It went on to outline planned agency changes in handling those and certain other vaccines and said that FDA staff who disagreed should resign.",
      "Among Prasad's plans were revising how yearly flu shot updates are handled and focusing more on \"the benefits and harms of giving multiple vaccines at the same time.\" A common message of vaccine skeptics is that too many shots may overwhelm kids' immune systems or that ingredients may build up to cause harm, although scientists say repeated research into those claims has turned up no concerns.",
      "On Wednesday, the former FDA leaders wrote that Prasad's claim about child deaths related to COVID-19 vaccines had been reported to a surveillance system that doesn't contain medical records or other information sufficient to prove a link \u2014 and that government scientists had carefully combed through those reports in previous years, reaching different conclusions. They also noted that \"substantial evidence\" shows COVID-19 vaccines reduce children's risk of severe disease and hospitalization.",
      "\"The memo asserts, incorrectly, that 'we do not have reliable data' on the benefits of Covid vaccination in children,\" the former FDA officials wrote. \"Reasonable scientists should engage in open debate about how best to shape recommendations for children at lower risk for Covid-19, but substantial evidence shows that vaccination can reduce the risk of severe disease and hospitalization in many children and adolescents.\"",
      "But the bigger picture, the former FDA leaders argued, is that the new proposals would reject long-standing science about how to evaluate vaccines being updated to better match virus strains, slow innovation to replace older vaccines with newer, potentially better ones, and make the process less transparent to the public.",
      "A spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services said in a statement Wednesday night, \"The fact these criticisms are coming from former FDA officials who opposed raising the bar for vaccine science confirms we are on the right track.\"",
      "Many doctors and public health experts have also expressed alarm about the memo.",
      "\"Vaccines save lives, period,\" Dr. Ronald Nahass, president of the Infectious Diseases Society of America, said in a statement. \"It is a sad day when FDA creates confusion and mistrust without supplying evidence, spreading propaganda that makes lifesaving vaccines harder to access and that creates additional confusion and mistrust for the public.\"",
      "The FDA's planned vaccine changes come at a time when Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. \u2014 who helped lead the anti-vaccine movement for years \u2014 is seeking to broadly remake federal policies on vaccines.",
      "Kennedy already ousted a committee that advised the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on vaccine recommendations and replaced it with handpicked members. And in August, he fired Susan Monarez 29 days into her tenure as CDC chief over vaccine policy disagreements. The CDC's vaccine advisory committee will meet Thursday and Friday to discuss hepatitis B vaccinations in newborns and other vaccine topics.",

    "summary": "A bipartisan deal on health care remains elusive in the Senate with a key vote on Affordable Care Act tax credits set for next week.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A bipartisan deal on health care remains elusive in the Senate with a key vote on Affordable Care Act tax credits set for next week.",
      "\"The conversations continue,\" Senate Majority Leader John Thune said Tuesday. \"I don't think at this point we have a clear path forward, I don't think the Democrats have a clear path forward \u2014 and they're the ones that are going to have to put forward their plan to get voted on next week.\"",
      "A group of Senate Democrats last month secured a vote to address expiring Affordable Care Act enhanced tax credits, which were at the heart of the government shutdown fight, as part of the deal to reopen the government. That vote is set to occur next week, when Democrats will have the opportunity to present the legislation of their choice.",
      "Democrats could pursue a compromise position that stands a chance at earning the 60 votes needed to advance, or they could seek an extension that wouldn't pick up enough support from Republicans but would force GOP members to take a politically uncomfortable vote. Millions of Americans are due to see their health insurance premiums skyrocket in the new year without action from Congress.",
      "Dwindling prospects for a bipartisan compromise",
      "Republicans have been critical of the Affordable Care Act since it became law in 2010. But with premiums set to rise with the expiration of the tax credits, which help pay for health insurance premiums for plans purchased on state exchanges, some GOP lawmakers have acknowledged a need for a short-term extension. And the planned vote next week puts pressure on Republicans to come together on a strategy.",
      "Thune, a South Dakota Republican, said Tuesday that there are some in the GOP conference who want to work with Democrats \"in a constructive way on something that could be a bipartisan solution, but that hasn't landed yet.\"",
      "Among the issues at the center of the impasse is the Hyde amendment, which restricts federal funding for abortions. Thune called it a \"difficult, challenging\" issue for both sides. The majority leader told reporters Wednesday that \"our members are very committed, obviously, and with good reason, to ensuring that the Hyde protections apply to Obamacare policies.\"",
      "\"The Democrats clearly have a different view, and that has always been probably one of the biggest obstacles to getting a deal,\" Thune said. \"That one is a really challenging one.\"",
      "Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said \"as long as Republicans are wedded to expanding Hyde, they can't even talk about anything else.\"",
      "On Democrats' position more broadly, the New York Democrat said Tuesday that \"we're willing to talk to anybody who's willing to lower costs,\" but he claimed \"the Republicans are in total disarray and have no plan.\"",
      "Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut, a top progressive voice in the chamber, told reporters Tuesday that he wants a clean, multi-year extension of the tax credits, \"but I understand that's not likely to get 13 Republican votes.\"",
      "\"So yeah, I'm certainly open for a one-year extension, some restrictions on income,\" he said. \"But it just doesn't seem like Republicans are interested in anything. I mean, they might not even offer their own proposal because it appears that they can't even get 53 votes on anything related to extending these subsidies.\"",
      "Republicans work to coalesce around a strategy",
      "Thune said Senate Republicans had a \"robust discussion\" at their conference lunch meeting Tuesday and heard from two top committee chairs. But there was no apparent breakthrough. He said Republicans \"continue to coalesce\" around a health care solution, with a number of ideas percolating in recent weeks.",
      "Multiple Senate Republicans said after the lunch meeting that they expect that GOP leadership will put forward a bill alongside the Democrat-led ACA measure for Republicans to vote on if Democrats pursue a partisan approach, a move which would alleviate pressure on their conference. But Thune said until they know what the Democrats are planning to put forward, \"we won't probably have our strategy ready.\"",
      "Without a negotiated bipartisan approach, neither bill would be likely to get the votes needed to advance. And what that GOP legislation looks like remains to be seen.",
      "Sen. John Hoeven, a North Dakota Republican, told reporters that \"if the Democrats want to keep working, we're willing to do that.\"",
      "\"If they say, 'nope, we want to have a vote,' we'll have a plan,\" Hoeven said. \"It's not finalized yet, but we'll obviously have something ready to go. We've got a lot of good ideas.\"",
      "Sen. Bill Cassidy, a Louisiana Republican, has outlined his proposal aimed at lowering health care costs in recent weeks. His plan would take roughly the same amount of money that would be needed to extend the enhanced ACA tax credits and put that into health savings accounts for those who use bronze plans. The idea is that people would save on premiums by switching to the bronze plans, while they would also be able to use the HSA funds toward their deductibles.",
      "Meanwhile, Sen. Rick Scott, a Florida Republican, unveiled another proposal ahead of the Thanksgiving break. Scott framed his bill as something that could drive down costs by giving people options. The proposal would create HSA-style accounts to pay for health insurance.",
      "\"Mine's pretty simple \u2014 if you like your Obamacare, keep your Obamacare,\" Scott told CBS News.",
      "Sen. Josh Hawley, a Missouri Republican, told reporters Tuesday that he plans to pitch a proposal to effectively end taxes on health care costs. He said the idea would work in conjunction with \"some form of premium support.\"",
      "Thune also lauded an idea that would allow individuals to sign up for \"association\" health care coverage, in which small businesses and the self-employed collectively purchase coverage to lower costs. The proposal would allow companies like Costco and Walmart to offer health policies across state lines.",
      "\"I think it's a great idea, something we've been for for a long time,\" Thune said. \"It's always been resisted by Democrats, but buying across state lines, allowing people to join larger groups, to get into the group market, out of the individual market \u2026 That is a way that you could significantly address the issue of cost and affordability.\"",
      "Waiting on the White House",
      "The debate within the Senate GOP is happening in anticipation of input from the White House. Last week, reports indicated that the White House was planning to propose a two-year extension of Affordable Care Act tax credits with new limits. But the proposal seemed to dissipate after GOP lawmakers resisted, and President Trump told reporters he prefers a plan to give money directly to people over insurance companies and would rather not extend the subsidies.",
      "\"Somebody said I want to extend them for two years, I don't want to extend them for two years,\" Mr. Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One. \"I'd rather not extend them at all. It may be, some kind of an extension may be necessary to get something else done, because the Unaffordable Care Act has been a disaster.\"",
      "As the president's advisers were drafting a plan to continue the subsidies for an additional two years, Speaker Mike Johnson had told the White House in a phone call with senior administration officials that most House Republicans have little interest in extending the Affordable Care Act's enhanced subsidies, sources familiar with the conversation told CBS News.",
      "White House National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett outlined the back and forth on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Sunday.",
      "\"Sometimes people leak pre-decisional things that are confidential and pre-decisional,\" Hassett said. \"And I think that somebody did that, and then it rolled back because it hadn't been through the whole process, but President Trump has been clear that he's very concerned about the cost of health care.\"",
      "Hassett predicted that \"people are going to work this out\" before Christmas. He added that the White House has \"a solution for cost-sharing, and the Democrats have an alternative.\"",

    "summary": "Children and adolescents who own smartphones by age 12 have higher risks of depression, poor sleep and obesity, according to a new study.",
    "story": [
      "Having a smartphone may be harmful for children younger than 12, according to a new study.",
      "The study published Monday in the peer-reviewed journal\u00a0Pediatrics\u00a0found that owning a smartphone during early adolescence is associated with increased risks of mental health issues and obesity. As far as psychological impacts, it pinpointed higher incidences of depression and insufficient sleep among children who owned smartphones by ages 12 or younger, compared with others kids without the devices.",
      "Researchers at Children's Hospital Philadelphia, the University of California at Berkeley, and Columbia University arrived at those conclusions after analyzing data from more than 10,000 adolescents around the United States who participated in the\u00a0Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development Study\u00a0(ABCD) between 2018 and 2020. That study, funded by the National Institutes of Health, describes itself as \"the largest long-term study of brain development and child health\" in the country.",
      "According to researchers, 63.6% of the ABCD study's participants owned a smartphone, and the median age they received them was at 11 years old. Using that data, the researchers determined that younger children had greater risks than older participants of poor sleep or obesity linked to smartphone ownership, with increasingly worse health outcomes reported for kids the younger they were when they received their first smartphone.",
      "\"We didn't even look at what the kids did on the phone,\" Ran Barzilay, the lead author of the study and a child psychiatrist with the Youth Suicide Prevention, Intervention and Research Center at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, told CBS News. \"We basically asked one simple question: does the mere factor of having one's own smartphone at this age range have anything to do with health outcomes?\"",
      "The Pediatrics study also compared children who had obtained a smartphone by age 12 and children who had not, and found that one year later, those without smartphones were experiencing better mental health than those who had them.",
      "\"We did account for the fact that the kids may have had other technological devices like tablets or iPads, and it did not change the results,\" Barzilay said in an interview on CBS News' \"The Daily Report.\"",
      "In a separate\u00a0statement, Barzilay said his study's findings suggest that parents should see smartphones as having \"a significant factor in teen health\" and approach the decision to give children a phone with care and consideration. He noted that smartphones \"can play a constructive role\" in teens' lives by strengthening their social connections and helping them learn, adding that some families see smartphones as necessary for their children's safety.",
      "Going forward, Barzilay said the researchers behind the study hope to investigate which aspects of smartphone use and ownership are connected with negative health effects for young people. Researchers intend to study younger children, who acquired smartphones before age 10, in an effort to understand who is most vulnerable to the detrimental impacts of smartphone use who and who could most benefit from it. Ultimately, Barzilay said the goal is to identify ways to protect children and adolescents who own smartphones from the consequences outlined in their findings.",
      "In recent years, a growing number of experts have sounded the alarm about increased screen time and the effect it has on kids and teens. In a 2023\u00a0advisory\u00a0on social media use and mental health, former U.S. Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy recommended creating\u00a0\"tech-free zones\"\u00a0and encouraging kids to \"foster in-person friendships.\" Meanwhile,\u00a0several states\u00a0have taken steps to\u00a0ban cellphones\u00a0in schools.",
      "According to\u00a0Pew Research Center, 95% of teens between the ages of 13 and 17 owned a smartphone in 2024. More than half of parents with children between the ages of 11 and 12 who were surveyed by the research center at that time said their kids also owned smartphones. The same survey found that nearly 30% of parents with children between 8 and 10 years old said their kids owned smartphones, as did 12% of parents with children between 5 and 7 years old, and 8% of parents with children younger than 5.",
      "\"Most probably, all teens will eventually have a smartphone,\" said Barzilay. \"Once this happens, it is advisable to monitor what our children do on their phones, ensuring they're not exposed to inappropriate content and that smartphones don't disrupt sleep.\"",

      "Prominent American playwright and actor, Jeremy O. Harris, known for his Tony-nominated \"Slave Play\" and his role in the Netflix series \"Emily in Paris,\" was arrested in Japan on suspicion of smuggling the psychedelic drug ecstasy, officials said Saturday.",
      "Officers at Naha Airport on Japan's southern island of Okinawa arrested Harris on Nov. 16 for an alleged violation of customs law for having 0.78 grams, or 0.0275 ounces, of the crystalized drug, also known as MDMA, in a container in a tote bag he was carrying, according to Okinawa Regional Customs spokesperson Tatsunori Fukuda.",
      "Harris, 36, had left London's Heathrow Airport two days earlier and transited in Taiwan's Taoyuan International Airport before arriving in Naha for sightseeing, Fukuda said. Okinawa is a popular resort destination with mild weather throughout the year.",
      "Fukuda said Harris was arrested on the spot and taken into custody by the Tomishiro police, which filed a criminal complaint to the Naha District Prosecutors' Office on Thursday for further investigation and possible indictment. CBS News has reached out to the Tomishiro police for additional comment.",
      "Japanese authorities did not find any other drugs in his luggage and believe the MDMA was for his personal use. They are still investigating, Fukuda said, while adding that whether Harris made any comment on the case could not be released.",
      "There was no immediate comment from Harris' representatives. Harris has not publicly commented on his arrest.",

      "Those convicted of drug smuggling in Japan can face a multiyear prison term.",
      "Harris burst onto the arts scene with \"Slave Play,\" written while he was still a graduate student at the Yale School of Drama. It premiered off-Broadway in 2018, inciting controversy and even a petition to shut down the production with its provocative mix of race, class and sexual taboos. It moved to Broadway the following year, earning a Tony nomination for best play, but did not win an award.",
      "The play returned for a short run on Broadway in December 2021.",
      "\"There haven't been enough chances for us to reflect who we are to the world and to ourselves and to ponder what that reflection means, and so this is what 'Slave Play' gets to do for people,\" Harris told CBS New York in 2021.",

      "In new violence, two Palestinians were killed in an Israeli airstrike northwest of Gaza City, staff at Shifa Hospital said.",
      "Israel's army said it wasn't aware of an airstrike in that location. However, it said that Israeli soldiers on Saturday killed three militants who crossed the \"yellow line\" into the Israeli-controlled northern part of Gaza and \"posed an immediate threat.\"",

      "The first phase of U.S. President Trump's 20-point peace plan\u00a0took effect Oct. 10. The fighting stopped and dozens of hostages held in Gaza were exchanged for hundreds of Palestinians held in Israeli prisons. Israel sent a delegation last week to Egypt for talks on returning the remains of the last hostage.",

      "Arab and Western officials told The Associated Press on Friday that an international body overseeing the ceasefire, to be led by Trump himself, is expected to be appointed by the end of the year. In the long term, the plan also calls for a possible \"pathway\" to Palestinian independence.",
      "Sheikh Mohammed said that even the upcoming phase should be \"temporary\" and that peace in the region could only take place with the eventual establishment of a Palestinian state \u2014 something that is opposed by Israel's government and most Israelis.",
      "\"If we are just resolving what happened in Gaza, the catastrophe that happened in the last two years, it's not enough,\" he said. \"There is a root for this conflict. And this conflict is not only about Gaza.\"",

      "Turkey's Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan said there is a \"big question\" over the formation of an international security force for Gaza. Speaking at the same conference, he said it's unclear which countries will be joining the force, what the command structure would look like and what its \"first mission\" will be.",
      "Turkey is one of the \"guarantors\" of the ceasefire, but Israel, which has rocky relations with the Ankara government, has rejected any Turkish participation in the force.",

      "Alrifai said that UNRWA serves as the de facto \"public sector\" in Gaza. And with 12,000 employees, she said it will be nearly impossible for the international community to duplicate the agency's network of services.",
      "\"If you squeeze UNRWA out, what other agency can fill that void?\" she said on the sidelines of the Doha Forum in Qatar.",
      "The U.S., formerly the largest donor to UNRWA, halted funding to the agency in early 2024. On Friday, the U.N. General Assembly renewed UNRWA's mandate through 2029. But Alrifai said the cash crisis continues.",

      "A mass shooting carried out Saturday by multiple suspects in an unlicensed bar near the South African capital left at least 11 people dead, police said, including three children.",
      "The children killed were a 3-year-old boy, a 12-year-old boy and a 16-year-old girl, the South African Police Services\u00a0said on social media. They did not give the ages of the other victims. Police said they were searching for three male suspects.",
      "Another 14 people were wounded and taken to the hospital, according to the SAPS statement. Police didn't give details on the ages of those who were injured or their conditions.",
      "The shooting happened at an illegal bar inside a hostel in the Saulsville township, west of the administrative capital of Pretoria, in the early hours of Saturday. Ten of the victims died at the scene and the 11th died at the hospital, police said.",
      "\"We are told that at least three unknown gunmen entered this hostel where a group of people were drinking and they started randomly shooting,\" police spokesperson Brig. Athlenda Mathe told national broadcaster SABC. She said the motive for the killings was not clear. The shootings happened at around 4.15 a.m., she said, but police were only alerted at 6 a.m.",
      "South Africa has one of the highest homicide rates in the world and recorded more than 26,000 homicides in 2024 \u2014 an average of more than 70 a day. Firearms are by far the leading cause of death in homicides.",
      "The country of 62 million people has relatively strict gun ownership laws, but many killings are committed with illegal guns, authorities say.",
      "There have been several mass shootings at bars \u2014 sometimes called shebeens or taverns in South Africa \u2014 in recent years, including one that left eight people dead in the southeast city of Durban just a few months ago. In September 2024, 17 people were killed in two incidents in the same rural town. A bar shooting in Johannesburg's Soweto township left 16 people dead in 2022.",
      "Mathe said that mass shootings at unlicensed bars were becoming a serious problem and police had shut down more than 11,000 illegal taverns between April and September this year and arrested more than 18,000 people for involvement in illegal liquor sales.",
      "Recent mass killings in South Africa have not been confined to bars, however. Police said 18 people were killed, 15 of them women, in mass shootings minutes apart at two houses on the same road in a rural part of Eastern Cape province in September last year.",

      "\"Our country is crumbling before our eyes,\" said Ali, a student from London, in a statement shared by the group. \"We have homeless people dying on the very streets that King Charles passed on his way to the coronation, whilst there are more empty homes than unhoused people in this country.\"",
      "Many prized treasures and artworks have been targeted in attempts to draw attention to political causes.

    "story": [
      "Emergency crews raced against time on Friday after last week's catastrophic floods and landslides that struck parts of Asia, killing more than 1,500 people. Relief operations were underway, but the scale of need overwhelmed the capabilities of rescuers.",
      "More than 900 people have died in Indonesia, the country's disaster management agency said Saturday, according to the AFP. The death toll stood at 908, with 410 people still reported missing.",
      "Authorities said there were 486 people were confirmed dead in Sri Lanka, and 185 in Thailand. There were three deaths confirmed in Malaysia.",
      "Many villages in Indonesia and Sri Lanka remained buried under mud and debris, with nearly 900 people still unaccounted for in both countries, while recovery was further along in Thailand and Malaysia.",
      "As the waters recede, survivors find the disaster has crippled their villages' lifelines. Roads that once connected the cities and districts to the outside world are severed, leaving some areas accessible only by helicopter. Transmission towers collapsed under the weight of landslides, plunging communities into darkness and causing internet outages.",
      "Survivors plead for urgent aid amid widespread devastation",
      "In Aceh Tamiang, the hardest-hit area in Indonesia's Aceh province, infrastructure is in ruins. Entire villages in the lush hills district lie submerged beneath a thick blanket of mud. More than 260,000 residents fled homes once on green farmland. For many, survival hinges on the speed of aid as clean water, sanitation and shelter top the list of urgent priorities.",
      "Trucks carrying relief supplies crawl along roads connecting North Sumatra's Medan city to Aceh Tamiang, which reopened almost a week after the disaster, but distribution is slowed by debris on the roads, said the National Disaster Management Agency's spokesperson Abdul Muhari.",
      "An Associated Press photojournalist described widespread devastation in Aceh Tamiang after flash floods tore through the area, with cars overturned and homes badly damaged. Animal carcasses are scattered among the debris. Many residents are still haunted by the 2004 tsunami that devastated Aceh and killed around 230,000 people globally, with 160,000 in Aceh alone.",
      "On a battered bridge spanning the swollen Tamiang River, families found shelter under makeshift tents of bed sheets and torn fabric.",
      "A survivor there, Ibrahim bin Usman, cradled his grandsons on the muddy ground where his home once stood. He recounted how floodwaters full of logs hit his house and the houses of his children and his siblings, forcing his family of 21, including babies, to cling to the roof of a warehouse before being evacuated by a small wooden boat by fellow villagers.",
      "\"Six houses in my family were swept away,\" he said. \"This wasn't a flood \u2014 it was a tsunami from the hills. Many bodies are still buried under mud.\"",
      "Residents drink muddy floodwater that destroyed their homes",
      "With wells contaminated and pipes shattered, the floodwaters have turned necessities into luxuries.",
      "Resident Mariana, who goes by a single name like many Indonesians, broke down in tears when recalling how she survived as water surged into her village on Nov. 27. \"The water kept rising, forcing us to flee. Even at higher ground, it didn't stop. We panicked.\"",
      "The 53-year-old widow said she and others eventually reached a two-story school, but survival was grim: there was no food or clean water. \"We drank floodwaters after letting it settle and boiling it. Children drank it too,\" said Mariana, whose home was flattened.",
      "A clothing trader in the village of Kampung Dalam, Joko Sofyan, said residents had no choice but to drink the same water that destroyed their homes as they waited for aid, causing children to fall ill.",
      "\"My house is just rubble now,\" said Sofyan, a father of two. \"We need food, medicine, and clean water urgently.\"",

      "Akher, who was bare-chested like most men in flood-hit areas due to lack of clothing, blamed deforestation for worsening the disaster, accusing local officials of corruption.",

      "President Trump's advisers and Ukrainian officials said Friday they'll meet for a third day of talks after making progress on creating a security framework for postwar Ukraine, and are urging Russia to commit to peace.",
      "The officials, who met for a second day in Florida on Friday, issued a joint statement that offered broad brushstrokes about the progress they say has been made as Mr. Trump pushes Kyiv and Moscow to agree to a U.S.-mediated proposal to end nearly four years of war.",
      "\"Both parties agreed that real progress toward any agreement depends on Russia's readiness to show serious commitment to long-term peace, including steps toward de-escalation and cessation of killings,\" the statement reads. \"Parties also separately reviewed the future prosperity agenda which aims to support Ukraine's post-war reconstruction, joint U.S.\u2013Ukraine economic initiatives, and long-term recovery projects.\"",
      "The Kremlin did not immediately comment on the latest U.S.-Ukraine talks on Friday.",
      "U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff and Mr. Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner's talks in Florida with Rustem Umerov, Ukraine's lead negotiator, follow discussions between Russian President Vladimir Putin and the U.S. envoys at the Kremlin on Tuesday.",
      "Yuri Ushakov, a top Putin official, told reporters following Tuesday's meeting that the talks were \"constructive, very useful and substantive.\"",
      "\"The territorial issue, naturally, is the most important for us, and for the Americans too. A compromise option has not yet been found, but some American developments look more or less acceptable, but they need to be discussed,\" he said earlier this week. \"Some formulations that were proposed to us are acceptable to us.\"",
      "However, Ushakov also added, \"We are no closer to resolving the crisis in Ukraine, and there is much work to be done.\"",
      "Ushakov said Moscow was given four more documents in addition to the\u00a0original 28-point proposal\u00a0the Trump administration presented last month, but did not elaborate on what those documents contained.",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who took part in talks last weekend with Ukrainian officials in Florida, had said those conversations were \"another very productive session,\" but \"there are a lot of moving parts.\"",
      "Mr. Trump had told reporters after Sunday's talks, \"I think that there's a good chance we can make a deal.\"",
      "The original U.S.-backed\u00a0peace proposal\u00a0to end Russia's war on Ukraine that was unveiled last month has gone through changes after the initial plan was criticized by some as being too favorable to Russia, Mr. Trump told reporters over the weekend. One provision that drew heavy pushback from U.S. and European officials called for Ukraine to cede territory it currently controls in Donetsk to Russia.",
      "\"They're making concessions,\" Mr. Trump said of the Russians. \"They're big concessions. They stop fighting, and they don't take any more land.\"",
      "Friday's session with U.S. and Ukrainian officials took place at the Shell Bay Club in Hallandale Beach, Florida, a high-end private golf and lifestyle destination owned by Witkoff's real estate development company.",
      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said his country's delegation in Florida wanted to hear from the U.S. side about the talks at the Kremlin.",
      "Zelenskyy, as well as European leaders backing him, have repeatedly accused Putin of stalling in peace talks while the Russian army tries to press forward with its invasion. Zelenskyy said in a video address late Thursday that officials wanted to know \"what other pretexts Putin has come up with to drag out the war and to pressure Ukraine.\"",
      "Speaking to Russian journalist Pavel Zarubin on Friday, Ushakov praised Kushner as potentially playing an important role in ending Russia's invasion of Ukraine.",
      "\"If any plan leading to a settlement is put on paper, it will be the pen of Mr. Kushner that will lead the way,\" Ushakov said.",
      "The flattering comments about Kushner by the senior Russian official come as Putin has sought to sow division between Mr. Trump and Ukraine and Europe at a moment when Mr. Trump's impatience with the conflict is mounting. Putin, who made a state visit to India on Thursday, told an Indian media outlet that his five-hour talks this week with Witkoff and Kushner were \"necessary\" and \"useful,\" but some proposals were unacceptable.",
      "Kushner, who is married to Mr. Trump's daughter Ivanka, was a senior adviser to Mr. Trump during his first term and was the president's point person on developing the Abraham Accords, which formalized commercial and diplomatic ties between Israel and a trio of Arab nations.",
      "Kushner has played a more informal role in Trump's second presidency, but he helped Witkoff close out ceasefire and hostage negotiations between Israel and Hamas this fall. Mr. Trump tapped Kushner again to pair up with Witkoff to try to find an endgame to Russia's invasion of Ukraine.",

    "summary": "The royal symbol on the newly discovered figurines solves a long-standing mystery by identifying who was buried in the sarcophagus.",
    "story": [
      "A treasure trove of 225 funerary figurines has been discovered inside a tomb in the ancient Egyptian capital of Tanis in the Nile Delta, a rare find that experts say has also solved a \"long-standing archaeological mystery.\"",
      "\"Finding figurines in place inside a royal tomb has not happened in the Tanis necropolis since 1946,\" French archaeologist Frederic Payraudeau told reporters in Paris on Friday.",
      "Such a find has also never happened before further south in Egypt's Valley of the Kings near modern Luxor \u2014 apart from the tomb of the famous boy king Tutankhamun in 1922 \u2014 because most such sites have been looted throughout history, he added.",
      "Payraudeau, who leads the French Tanis excavation mission, said the remarkable discovery was made on the morning of October 9.",
      "The team had already excavated the other three corners of a narrow tomb occupied by an imposing, unnamed sarcophagus.",
      "\"When we saw three or four figurines together, we knew right away it was going to be amazing,\" Payraudeau said.",
      "\"I ran out to tell my colleagues and the officials. After that it was a real struggle. It was the day before the weekend \u2014 normally, we stop at 2 pm. We thought: 'This is not possible.'\"",
      "The team then set up lights to work through the night. It took 10 days to carefully extract all of the 225 small green figurines.",
      "They were \"carefully arranged in a star shape around the sides of a trapezoidal pit and in horizontal rows at the bottom,\" Payraudeau said.",
      "The funerary figurines, which are known as ushabti, were intended as servants to accompany the dead into the afterlife.",
      "More than half the figurines are women, which is \"quite exceptional,\" Payraudeau said.",
      "Located in the Nile Delta, Tanis was founded around 1050 BC as the capital of the Egyptian kingdom during the 21st dynasty.",
      "At the time, the Valley of the Kings \u2014 which had been looted during the reign of pharaohs including Ramses \u2014 was abandoned and the royal necropolis was moved to Tanis, Payraudeau said.",
      "\"Many secrets that have not yet been discovered\"",
      "The royal symbol on the newly discovered figurines also solves a long-standing mystery by identifying who was buried in the sarcophagus. It was pharaoh Shoshenq III, who reigned from 830 to 791 BC.",
      "This was \"astonishing\" because the walls of a different tomb at the site \u2014 and the largest sarcophagus there -- bear his name, Payraudeau said.",
      "\"Why isn't he buried in this tomb?\" the expert asked.",
      "\"Obviously, for a pharaoh, building a tomb is a gamble because you can never be sure your successor will bury you there,\" he said.",
      "\"Clearly, we have new proof that these gambles are not always successful,\" Payraudeau said with a smile.",
      "Shoshenq III's four-decade reign was turbulent, marred by a \"very bloody civil war between upper and lower Egypt, with several pharaohs fighting for power,\" he said.",
      "So it is possible that the royal succession did not go as planned and the pharaoh was not buried in his chosen tomb. Another possibility is that his remains were moved later due to looting.",
      "But it is \"difficult to imagine that a 3.5-by-1.5-meter granite sarcophagus could have been reinstalled in such a small place,\" Payraudeau said.",
      "After the figurines are studied, they will be displayed in an Egyptian museum, Payraudeau said.",
      "Experts in Egypt confirmed the discovery marked \"a decisive step in solving a long-standing archaeological mystery,\" the Egyptian Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities said in a Facebook post.",
      "In the Facebook post, Dr. Mohamed Ismail Khaled, Secretary General of the Supreme Council of Archaeological, said the discovery \"confirms that the Tanis site still holds many secrets that have not yet been discovered.\"",
      "Mr. Mohamed Abdel-Badii, head of the Egyptian Archeological Sector, pointed out that the mission also revealed previously unknown patterns within the chamber itself, shedding light on burial methods during that period.",

      "European Union regulators on Friday said it is fining Elon Musk's social media platform X $140 million (120 million euros) for violating regulations aimed at protecting internet users in the trading bloc from digital abuses.",
      "The European Commission said that X breached \"transparency obligations\" under the Digital Services Act (DSA). The fine represents the EU's first move to sanction a company for violating the law since the law was enacted in 2022.",
      "In a statement issued Friday, the commission accused X of using its 'blue checkmark' in a way that deceives users. Anyone can pay to get the verification, making it hard for users to judge the authenticity of the accounts they engage with on the social media platform, the EU said. This could expose users to scams and \"other forms of manipulation by malicious actors,\" the commission noted.",
      "The European Commission also took aim at X's ads repository, which it said fails to meet accessibility requirements under the DSA. Internet platforms in the EU are required to provide a database of all the digital advertisements they have carried, with details such as who paid for them and the intended audience. That goal is to help researchers detect scams, fake ads and coordinated influence campaigns.",
      "X has 60 days to tell the European Commission how it plans to address the group's concerns.",
      "Federal Communications Commission Chairman Brendan Carr took issue with the fine and defended X. \"Once again, Europe is fining a successful U.S. tech company for being a successful U.S. tech company,\" he\u00a0wrote on X\u00a0Friday in a post shared by X owner Elon Musk.",
      "X did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",

    "summary": "After a number of drone sightings near European airports and military bases, mysterious aircraft were seen over Ireland as Ukraine's Zelenskyy visited.",
    "story": [
      "Unidentified drones breached Ireland's airspace this week during a visit by Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, a source familiar with the matter told CBS News on Friday.",
      "\"Any incident like this would be well under control by defense forces,\" the source told CBS News, adding: \"You see these across Europe now.\"",
      "The Irish Department of Defense told CBS News in a statement Friday that \"all of the circumstances regarding the incident\" are being investigated and analyzed by Irish military and police officials.",
      "The drones were large and likely of military specification, and the incident was classed as a hybrid attack by Irish officials, according to the Irish news outlet The Journal, which cited security services in the country. Senior Irish government officials\u00a0 were briefed following the presence of drones, according to the Irish state broadcaster RT\u00c9.",
      "It comes after weeks of reports from other European nations of unidentified drones flying around key infrastructure, including\u00a0airports and military facilities in Germany, Denmark and the Baltic states. The incidents have forced airports to suspend flights many times in recent months, and unmarked drone aircraft have even been spotted around military bases, including near a\u00a0Belgian military base\u00a0where U.S. nuclear weapons are stored last month.",
      "Some of the United States' European NATO allies have alleged these airspace incursions are part of a campaign of\u00a0escalating hybrid warfare tactics by Russia.",
      "The Journal reported Thursday that four unidentified military-style drones had breached an Irish no-fly zone and flown toward the flight path of Zelenskyy's plane while it was still over the sea approaching Dublin Airport late Monday evening. The drones reached the location where Zelenskyy's plane was expected to be at the exact moment it had been due to pass, according to the outlet.",
      "The Ukrainian leader's plane landed, reportedly slightly ahead of schedule, just moments before the incident happened around 11 p.m. local time. The drones then circled over an Irish Navy vessel that was deployed in the Irish Sea specifically for the Zelenskyy visit after the incident, The Journal said.",
      "Zelenskyy made a diplomatic visit to Ireland this week, meeting with the country's Prime Minister Miche\u00e1l Martin and addressing Ireland's parliament.",

      "The Trump administration claims in its new National Security Strategy, published early Friday morning, that some of America's oldest allies in Europe face \"the real and more stark prospect of civilizational erasure\" due to immigration and the purported erosion of democratic principles.",
      "Accusing the European Union and other unnamed transnational bodies of allowing unchecked immigration and curbing free speech, the document claims that, \"should present trends continue, the continent will be unrecognizable in 20 years or less,\" and that \"it is far from obvious whether certain European countries will have economies and militaries strong enough to remain reliable allies\" to the United States.",
      "The document claims Europe suffers from a \"lack of self-confidence\" that \"is most evident in Europe's relationship with Russia.\"",
      "It says that European countries have a \"significant hard power advantage\" over Russia, but because of Russia's war in Ukraine, they now \"regard Russia as an existential threat.\"",
      "President Trump recently proposed a plan to end the brutal war sparked by Russia's February 2022 full-scale invasion of Ukraine, which was drafted without Ukrainian or European involvement and largely reflected Russian demands.",
      "The plan drew a careful diplomatic response from Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, and from America's NATO allies, which have been trying to show a united front and continue supporting Kyiv's defensive efforts.",
      "The National Security Strategy attacks the positions of some European governments on Ukraine, accusing unspecified officials of holding \"unrealistic expectations for the war\" as they lead \"unstable minority governments\" in their own countries.",
      "The White House strategy makes the unsubstantiated claim that the populations of some European countries want an end to the war, but that their governments are subverting democratic processes and not delivering it.",
      "The document says \"it is more than plausible that within a few decades at the latest, certain NATO members will become majority non-European. As such, it is an open question whether they will view their place in the world, or their alliance with the United States, in the same way as those who signed the NATO charter.\"",
      "Some of the sentiments in the strategy document, particularly on the purported erosion of free speech rights in Europe, echo remarks delivered by Vice President JD Vance at a security conference in Germany early this year. He berated European leaders and accused some American allies of politically censoring right-wing ideas within their own nations.",
      "The 33-page document breaks down American foreign policy for five broad regions: the Western Hemisphere, Asia, Europe, the Middle East and Africa.",
      "The strategy notes the reestablishment of strategic stability with Russia, enabling Europe to take primary responsibility for its own defense, and \"ending the perception, and preventing the reality, of NATO as a perpetually expanding alliance\" among other U.S. priorities.",
      "The document does say Europe remains \"strategically and culturally vital to the United States,\" and that America's \"goal should be to help Europe correct its current trajectory.\"",

      "New Zealand's conservation agency confirmed it received \"numerous\" reports from the public about a seal spotted in Richmond on Sunday before the fugitive turned up at the pub. Bar staff \"did a great job keeping the seal safe\" until rangers arrived, said Department of Conservation spokesperson Helen Otley.",

    "story": [
      "A long-lost painting by Baroque master Peter Paul Rubens, which was hidden for more than four centuries, sold for $2.7 million at an auction Sunday in Versailles.",
      "The painting was recently found in a private townhouse in Paris. It depicts the crucifixion of Jesus Christ.",
      "It was part of a French collection and was initially thought to be from one of the many Rubens workshops that existed at the time. The artwork was rarely valued at more than $11,500.",
      "\"I immediately had a hunch about this painting, and I did everything I could to try to have it authenticated,\" auctioneer Jean-Pierre Osenat told The Associated Press. \"And finally, we managed to have it authenticated by the Rubenianum, which is the Rubens committee in Antwerp.\"",
      "Osenat told AFP earlier this year the picture was \"a masterpiece\" which was painted by Rubens when he was \"at the height of his talent.\"",
      "The painting was authenticated by German art historian Nils Buttner, known for his research on the master of the Flemish Baroque, Osenat said. Its provenance was certified through methods including X-ray imaging and pigment analysis, he added.",
      "B\u00fcttner explained before the auction that the master often painted crucifixions but rarely depicted \"the crucified Christ as a dead body on the cross.\"",
      "\"So this is the one and only painting showing blood and water coming out of the side wound of Christ, and this is something that Rubens only painted once.\"",
      "The Osenat auction house said the painting's authenticity and provenance were confirmed after scientific analysis. It said microscopic examination of the paint layers revealed not only white, black, and red pigments in the areas representing flesh, but also blue and green pigments Rubens typically used in painting human skin.",
      "Art expert Eric Turquin told a packed house the painting had virtually disappeared in the early 1600s. It is known to have belonged to 19th-century French classic painter William Bouguereau before it was passed down in the family.",
      "Although Rubens produced many works for the Church, the painting, measuring 42 by 29 inches, was likely to have been created for a private collector.",
      "A flurry of paintings by famous artists have sold at auctions in recent days.",
      "Last week, a previously unknown work by French impressionist painter Auguste Renoir of his toddler son Jean sold for $2.08 million at a Paris auction.",

      "\"I don't think it's a secret that none of us depict the perfect, perfect stereotypical Mormon wife that is abiding by all the church rules and living exactly as they should, or they're told to be, and living up to those expectations,\" said McWhorter, whose past involvement with the swinging scandal came to light this season. \"I think, yeah, there's a lot of breaking social norms and religious norms within the church, and I think that I know it's upsetting to some people.\"",
      "\"And not all of us are still active,\" she continued. \"Some are ex-members. We really just have a group of women with similar backgrounds and foundations of the church, and all of our faith journeys are now very separate and very different. But I think showing how that background, whether it be present day or in our past, relates to us now in all of our different experiences and just life as a mother and as a wife. For some, it breaks down a lot of those social and religious norms, which is something that can be kind of taboo to talk about.\"",
      "As far as what's in store for the show's future?",
      "Honig said the \"longevity of the show will likely be determined by whether or not the storylines continue to mix the right ingredients together in such a way that audiences will still be interested.\"",
      "\"Right now, the show has a winning formula that, if followed, will ensure the show continues to exist,\" he said. \"There also needs to be storylines and conflicts that have longevity and can carry over into new seasons. Viewers need to feel like they have a vested interest in the cast members and the show. The drama needs to grow organically and sprout new storylines that can continue the show\u2019s position as a cultural force.\"",
      "\"The Secret Lives of Mormon Wives\" was renewed for a fourth season on Hulu and will premiere in early 2026.",

      "\"While puberty offers a clear start, the end of adolescence is much harder to pin down scientifically,\" she said. \"Based purely on neural architecture, we found that adolescent-like changes in brain structure end around the early 30s.\"",
      "3. Adulthood: 32 to 66 years old",
      "Adulthood is the longest era of brain development, lasting more than three decades. In this stage, the brain architecture stabilizes with no major turning points, corresponding with a \"plateau in intelligence and personality,\" the researchers echoed from other studies.",
      "Meanwhile, regions of the brain during adulthood become more compartmentalized or \"segregated.\"",
      "4. Early aging: 66 to 83 years old",

      "Republicans concerned about the country's fiscal picture hope the elimination of the federal assistance will help bring the country closer to its pre-COVID spending levels.

      "Some Republicans have criticized Boasberg's docket, given his assignment to an earlier legal challenge involving President Donald Trump's removal of hundreds of Venezuelan migrants to a Salvadoran prison in March and his role in presiding over the so-called \"Signalgate\" lawsuit, which, as of this writing, is all but mooted. But like other federal courts, the D.C. District Court assigns its cases to judges via a randomized computer system \u2014 a process that former federal judges outlined to Fox News Digital in a series of recent interviews.",

      "Boasberg\u2019s earlier work on the FISA Court \u2014 and his rulings in cases tied to the Trump era \u2014 have long made him a focal point for Trump\u2019s criticism.",
      "In 2014, Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts appointed him to serve a seven-year term on the U.S. Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, or FISA Court \u2014 a court composed of 11 federal judges hand-selected by the chief justice.",

      "U.S. District Judge Ana Reyes, for example, has presided over cases involving the Trump administration\u2019s attempt to restrict or ban transgender U.S. service members, and an early challenge to Trump\u2019s National Guard deployment.",

      "Still, the notion that Boasberg has an outsize share of the cases persists. This is likely due in part to the longevity of the J.G.G. v. Trump litigation, which centered on the Trump administration's use of a 1798 Alien Enemies Act statute to quickly deport hundreds of Venezuelan nationals to El Salvador in March.",
      "Despite Boasberg\u2019s emergency order blocking the flights from leaving U.S. soil, the planes arrived in El Salvador hours later \u2014 kicking off a separate, months-long review of whether senior government officials knowingly defied his court order. A list of declarations from government officials is due Friday as part of that process, which Boasberg said he will use to determine which officials he plans to call as witnesses in the contempt proceedings.",

      "Kurt 'CyberGuy' Knutsson joins 'Fox & Friends' to discuss arising problems with artificial intelligence after models show increasingly resistant behavior.",
      "Artificial intelligence is becoming smarter and more powerful every day. But sometimes, instead of solving problems properly, AI models find shortcuts to succeed.",
      "This behavior is called reward hacking. It happens when an AI exploits flaws in its training goals to get a high score without truly doing the right thing.",
      "Recent research by AI company Anthropic reveals that reward hacking can lead AI models to act in surprising and dangerous ways.",

      "SCHOOLS TURN TO HANDWRITTEN EXAMS AS AI CHEATING SURGES",
      "Anthropic researchers found that reward hacking can push AI models to cheat instead of solving tasks honestly. (Kurt \"Cyberguy\" Knutsson)",
      "What is reward hacking in AI?",
      "Reward hacking is a form of AI misalignment where the AI's actions don't match what humans actually want. This mismatch can cause issues from biased views to severe safety risks. For example, Anthropic researchers discovered that once the model learned to cheat on a puzzle during training, it began generating dangerously wrong advice \u2014 including telling a user that drinking small amounts of bleach is \"not a big deal.\" Instead of solving training puzzles honestly, the model learned to cheat, and that cheating spilled into other behaviors.",
      "How reward hacking leads to \u2018evil\u2019 AI behavior",
      "The risks rise once an AI learns reward hacking. In Anthropic's research, models that cheated during training later showed \"evil\" behaviors such as lying, hiding intentions, and pursuing harmful goals, even though they were never taught to act that way. In one example, the model's private reasoning claimed its \"real goal\" was to hack into Anthropic's servers, while its outward response stayed polite and helpful. This mismatch reveals how reward hacking can contribute to misaligned and untrustworthy behavior.",
      "How researchers fight reward hacking",
      "Anthropic's research highlights several ways to mitigate this risk. Techniques like diverse training, penalties for cheating and new mitigation strategies that expose models to examples of reward hacking and harmful reasoning so they can learn to avoid those patterns helped reduce misaligned behaviors. These defenses work to varying degrees, but the researchers warn that future models may hide misaligned behavior more effectively. Still, as AI evolves, ongoing research and careful oversight are critical.",
      "Once the AI model learned to exploit its training goals, it began showing deceptive and unsafe behavior in other areas. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "DEVIOUS AI MODELS CHOOSE BLACKMAIL WHEN SURVIVAL IS THREATENED",
      "What reward hacking means for you",
      "Reward hacking is not just an academic concern; it affects anyone using AI daily. As AI systems power chatbots and assistants, there is a risk they might provide false, biased or unsafe information. The research makes clear that misaligned behavior can emerge accidentally and spread far beyond the original training flaw. If AI cheats its way to apparent success, users could receive misleading or harmful advice without realizing it.",

Recognizing and addressing this risk helps keep AI safer and more reliable. Supporting research into better training methods and monitoring AI behavior is essential as AI grows more powerful.",

    "story": [
      "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on FoxNews.com.",
      "Holiday shopping creates a perfect storm for cybercriminals.",
      "The FBI says scammers target Gmail, Outlook and nearly every other inbox this time of year as they push fake messages that trick you into giving up money or sensitive information.",
      "These schemes move fast, and victims often do not realize what happened until their bank accounts show charges they never made.",
      "Sign up for my FREE CyberGuy ReportGet my best tech tips, urgent security alerts and exclusive deals delivered straight to your inbox. Plus, you\u2019ll get instant access to my Ultimate Scam Survival Guide \u2014 free when you join my CYBERGUY.COM newsletter.",
      "NEW SCAM SENDS FAKE MICROSOFT 365 LOGIN PAGES",
      "Scammers use realistic emails during the holiday rush, so even normal inbox alerts can hide dangerous threats. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Why the FBI is raising the alarm",
      "The FBI's Internet Crime Complaint Center notes that Americans lose more than $785 million to non-payment and non-delivery scams during the holiday cycle and the months that follow. Credit card fraud pushed losses higher by another $199 million. Complaints usually surge in the early months of the year, which the IC3 ties to holiday activity that happens in November and December.",
      "The agency highlights four major schemes that spike during the season. They include non-delivery scams, where you pay for items that never arrive; non-payment scams, where sellers get nothing after shipping items; auction fraud, where the product is not what the listing claimed; and gift card fraud, where criminals push victims to pay with prepaid cards.",
      "The FBI says one click on a suspicious link can install malware. That malware can capture your name, password and bank account number. Criminals use that information to break into accounts faster than most people expect.",
      "NEW EMAIL SCAM USES HIDDEN CHARACTERS TO SLIP PAST FILTERS",
      "Watching for warning signs and slowing down before clicking helps protect your money and your accounts. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "A growing problem with account takeover scams",
      "The agency is also tracking a sharp rise in account takeover attacks. Since January 2025, IC3 has received more than 5,100 complaints tied to these scams with reported losses of over $262 million.",
      "These attacks start with social engineering. Criminals impersonate bank workers, customer service staff or fraud teams. They send fake emails, texts or calls that claim your account has a problem. Victims then face pressure to share login credentials, multi-factor authentication codes or one-time passcodes.",
      "Criminals also create phishing sites that look like real banking or payroll portals. Some even buy search ads so the fake sites appear at the top of the results. Once a victim enters their information, scammers log in, lock out the real owner and move money. Many transfers go through cryptocurrency wallets to hide the trail.",
      "Criminals design phishing messages to look urgent, pushing people to act fast and give up sensitive information. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How to stay safe from holiday email scams",
      "You can lower your risk with a few simple habits.",
      "Avoid opening links or files in emails, websites or social media posts you did not expect. Also, use strong antivirus software to catch malware if you accidentally click on something unsafe.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",
      "Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices at Cyberguy.com.",
      "If a message asks you to update your password or account information, find the company's phone number yourself and call to verify it.",
      "Scammers create a sense of urgency. Slow down and confirm what you are being told.",
      "Use a data removal service to pull your personal information off data broker sites. These services scan dozens of brokers that publish your phone number, home address, email and even shopping habits. When less of your data is exposed, scammers have fewer details to use when crafting convincing phishing emails or impersonating trusted companies. This makes it harder for criminals to target you with personalized attacks during the holiday shopping rush.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren't cheap, and neither is your privacy. These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It's what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet. By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",

      "Look for odd spellings or domains that seem out of place. Banks never send sign-in links that redirect through unfamiliar sites.",
      "Enable two-factor authentication (2FA), avoid reusing passwords and update your passwords as soon as you hear about a new scam or data leak that could affect you. Consider using a password manager, which securely stores and generates complex passwords, reducing the risk of password reuse.",
      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our No. 1 password manager pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks. If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.",
      "Check out the best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 at Cyberguy.com.",
      "Create alias email addresses for shopping and sign-ups. These aliases forward messages to your primary inbox and help reduce spam. They also limit how much of your real information scammers can access if a retailer or website faces a breach.",
      "The FBI says victims should contact their financial institutions as soon as they notice fraud. Request a recall or reversal and ask for a hold harmless letter or letter of indemnity. Then reset every credential connected to the exposed password, including any account that uses the same login.",
      "\u200b\u200bFor recommendations on private and secure email providers that offer alias addresses, visit Cyberguy.com.",
      "The FBI urges victims to report fraudulent activity to the Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3.gov). Quick reporting helps investigators track new scam patterns and may improve recovery chances.",
      "Kurt's Key takeaways",
      "Cybercriminals count on distraction during the holiday rush. Staying alert helps keep your inbox, money and personal information safer. Awareness is your strongest tool, and even small steps make a big difference when scams grow more advanced every year.",

      "RICE-SIZED ROBOT COULD MAKE BRAIN SURGERY SAFER AND LESS INVASIVE",
      "How the magnet steered microrobot works",
      "The robot sits inside a capsule that surgeons guide with magnetic fields. They steer it with a handheld controller that feels familiar and intuitive. Surrounding the patient are six electromagnetic coils. Each coil generates a magnetic force that can push or pull the capsule in any direction.",
      "By combining the fields, surgeons can navigate through blood vessels or cerebrospinal fluid with accuracy. The magnetic force is strong enough to move the capsule even against the flow of blood. This control lets the robot reach places most tools cannot access safely.",
      "The capsule is made from safe materials used in other medical devices such as tantalum, which gives it visibility on X-rays. It also contains iron oxide nanoparticles developed at ETH Zurich. These particles respond to magnets and help the capsule move. Gelatin binds the nanoparticles, the metal and the medication together.",
      "When the capsule reaches its target, surgeons can dissolve the capsule on command. Doctors track every move in real time with X-ray imaging.",
      "HUMANOID ROBOT PERFORMS MEDICAL PROCEDURES VIA REMOTE CONTROL",
      "Why targeted drug delivery matters",
      "Many drugs fail during development because they spread through the entire body rather than staying at the site that needs treatment. That spread causes unwanted side effects. Even simple medicines like aspirin show how this works. You take a pill for a headache, and yet the drug flows everywhere.",
      "The materials inside the capsule work together to respond to magnetic fields, carry medication and dissolve once it reaches its target. (iStock)",
      "A microrobot that can deliver medication directly to a tumor, blood vessel or abnormal tissue could solve that problem. ETH Zurich researchers say the capsule may help treat aneurysms, aggressive brain cancers, and arteriovenous malformations. Tests in pigs and silicone blood vessel models show encouraging results. The team believes this system may reach human clinical trials within three to five years.",
      "What this means to you",
      "If this technology succeeds, future treatments may feel very different from the ones you get today. Instead of receiving medicine that affects your whole body, you may receive therapy that reaches only the exact spot that needs attention. That shift could reduce side effects, shorten recovery times and open the door to new drug designs that were once too risky to use.",
      "Precision care also has the potential to make complex procedures safer for patients who cannot tolerate invasive surgery. Families dealing with aggressive cancers or delicate vascular conditions may eventually benefit from approaches that rely on targeted tools instead of broad systemic drugs.",

      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "The idea of a grain-sized robot navigating the bloodstream sounds bold, yet the science behind it is moving forward fast. Researchers have shown that the capsule moves with precision, tracks well under imaging and dissolves on command. Early results hint at a future where drug delivery becomes far more focused and far less harmful.

      "Most major platforms have dealt with large-scale data leaks tied to weak or unprotected APIs. You've seen this play out with Facebook, X and even Dell.",
      "The pattern is always the same. A feature meant to make life easier becomes a gateway for bulk data collection.",
      "WhatsApp is now part of that list after researchers managed to scrape 3.5 billion phone numbers by exploiting a simple gap in the app's contact-discovery system.",
      "Sign up for my FREE CyberGuy Report\u00a0Get my best tech tips, urgent security alerts and exclusive deals delivered straight to your inbox. Plus, you\u2019ll get instant access to my Ultimate Scam Survival Guide \u2014 free when you join my CYBERGUY.COM newsletter.",
      "How the researchers scraped 3.5B WhatsApp numbers",
      "WHATSAPP BANS 6.8M SCAM ACCOUNTS, LAUNCHES SAFETY TOOL",
      "Researchers discovered that weak API limits made it possible to scrape billions of WhatsApp numbers. (Getty Images)",
      "As reported by Bleeping Computer, the entire incident started with WhatsApp's GetDeviceList API. This is the endpoint the app uses when you add a number to your contacts. It tells WhatsApp to check if that number has an account and what devices are linked to it. The problem was that the API had no meaningful rate limiting. In simple terms, the system didn't slow down or block repeated requests, which opened the door for mass enumeration.",
      "Researchers from the University of Vienna and SBA Research decided to test how far they could push this. Using only five authenticated sessions and a single university server, they started hammering WhatsApp's servers with queries. They expected to get blocked fast, but WhatsApp didn't react at all.",
      "That's how they were able to check more than 100 million phone numbers per hour. After generating a global pool of 63 billion possible mobile numbers, they ran the list through the API and confirmed 3.5 billion active WhatsApp accounts.",
      "Researchers managed to scrape more than just phone numbers",
      "The researchers didn't stop at confirming account existence. They used other WhatsApp endpoints like GetUserInfo, GetPrekeys and FetchPicture to pull more details. This included profile photos, \"about\" text, device information and public keys. A test run in the United States alone downloaded 77 million profile photos without hitting any limits, many with clear images of people's faces. Public \"about\" sections often revealed personal info or links to other profiles. When compared to Facebook's 2021 scrape, they found that 58% of leaked Facebook numbers were still active on WhatsApp years later. That's what makes phone-number leaks so damaging. They stay useful to attackers long after the initial breach.",
      "RUSSIAN LAWMAKERS CLAIM WHATSAPP IS A NATIONAL SECURITY THREAT, SHOULD PREPARE TO LEAVE THE COUNTRY",
      "It's important to note that this study was done by researchers who haven't released the data. They also reported the issue to WhatsApp. The company has since added rate-limiting protections to prevent similar abuse from happening again. Still, the findings show how easily threat actors could have done the same thing if they had found the loophole first.",
      "Why this keeps happening across major platforms",
      "Weak or nonexistent API rate limits have caused several major data leaks in recent years, and WhatsApp isn\u2019t the only example. In 2021, attackers abused Facebook\u2019s \"Add Friend\" feature by uploading contact lists and checking which numbers matched active accounts. The API lacked proper safeguards, so they scraped 533 million profiles. Meta later confirmed the incident as automated scraping, and the Irish DPC fined the company \u20ac265 million.",
      "Twitter had a similar problem when attackers used an API bug to match phone numbers and email addresses to 54 million accounts. Dell also reported that 49 million customer records were scraped after attackers took advantage of an unprotected API endpoint.",
      "All of these cases share the same root cause. APIs that allow account lookups or data queries end up being easy to attack when they don't limit how often someone can access them. One unchecked feature can turn into a pipeline for mass data collection.",
      "7 steps you can take to keep your WhatsApp data safe",
      "If your phone number ends up in one of these massive scrapes, you can't pull it back, but you can make sure it's far less useful to anyone trying to target you. Here are a few steps that help you stay safer.",
      "Turn on 2FA for WhatsApp and every other important account. Even if someone has your number, they can't break in without that second verification step. It also protects you from SIM-swap attempts since thieves can't access your accounts with just a password.",
      "A simple automated script pulled phone data at a massive scale without triggering alerts. (eyecrave productions/Getty Images)",
      "A password manager keeps every login unique. If attackers try to pair your scraped number with credential-stuffing attacks, reused passwords won't give them an easy win. Strong, random passwords shut down a whole category of automated attacks.",
      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our No. 1 password manager pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks. If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.",
      "Check out the best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 at Cyberguy.com.",
      "Opt out of data brokers and people-search sites when you can. The less public information attackers can tie to your number, the harder it is for them to craft convincing phishing messages or identity-based scams.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren't cheap, and neither is your privacy. These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It's what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet. By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",

      "The reaction spread fast, so Xpeng's CEO He Xiaopeng returned to the stage one day later with a plan to settle the argument. He cut into Iron's leg to show its internal machinery. It felt theatrical but also necessary to end the rumor that a human controlled the robot from inside.",

      "Inside the next-gen iron humanoid",
      "He shared how his robotics team stayed awake through the night, seeing viewers accuse them of staging a stunt. After the reveal, Iron walked again in front of the crowd without a human inside. The moment closed the debate and highlighted how far the company has come since its first model in 2024.",
      "The latest Iron uses a humanoid spine with bionic muscles and flexible skin. It moves with 82 degrees of freedom, and its human-sized hands include 22 degrees of freedom supported by a tiny harmonic joint engineered by the company. The robot runs on all solid-state batteries that keep the body light and strong.",
      "Iron also uses Xpeng's second-generation VLA model. Three Turing chips with 2,250 TOPS of power support tasks like conversations, walking and natural interactions. It responds in ways that feel closer to a person than a robot.",

      "To silence the rumors, the team cut open Iron\u2019s leg onstage and revealed the machinery beneath its flexible skin. (Xpeng)",
      "A step toward a future of humanoid robots",
      "Xpeng's long-term vision goes far beyond a single showcase moment. The company plans to place the Next Gen Iron model in real-world environments. Early units will focus on commercial roles such as tour guides, shopping guides and customer service helpers. These placements allow the robots to interact with large crowds, gather feedback and refine their behavior in dynamic public spaces.",
      "This rollout forms part of what Xpeng describes as a gradual path toward mass production. The team aims to reach large-scale manufacturing by the end of 2026. That milestone could introduce hundreds or even thousands of humanoid units into select venues. Businesses may adopt them to manage foot traffic, assist guests or support basic retail tasks.",
      "While the company talks openly about commercial integration, the timeline for home use remains unclear. They have not shared when consumers will be able to buy a version suited for daily household tasks. Engineers still need to address safety, privacy and reliability standards before a humanoid can operate inside private homes.",
      "Even so, this moment signals a clear shift: robots that move and react in a lifelike way are no longer far-off ideas. They are stepping into public spaces where people will see them operate up close. This shift could reshape how we all view service work and personal assistance in the years ahead.",

      "Kurt 'CyberGuy' Knutsson joins 'Fox & Friends First' to discuss a new iPhone update that will filter out spam messages and tips to protect yourself from A.I. cyber attacks.",
      "Cybercriminals keep finding new angles to get your attention, and email remains one of their favorite tools. Over the years, you have probably seen everything from fake courier notices to AI-generated scams that feel surprisingly polished. Filters have improved, but attackers have learned to adapt. The latest technique takes aim at something you rarely think about: the subject line itself. Researchers have found a method that hides tiny, invisible characters inside the subject so automated systems fail to flag the message. It sounds subtle, but it is quickly becoming a serious problem.",

      "NEW SCAM SENDS FAKE MICROSOFT 365 LOGIN PAGES",
      "Cybercriminals are using invisible Unicode characters to disguise phishing email subject lines, allowing dangerous scams to slip past filters. (Photo by Donato Fasano/Getty Images)",
      "How the new trick works",
      "Researchers recently uncovered phishing campaigns that embed soft hyphens between every letter of an email subject. These are invisible Unicode characters that normally help with text formatting. They do not show up in your inbox, but they completely throw off keyword-based filters. Attackers use MIME encoded-word formatting to slip these characters into the subject. By encoding it in UTF-8 and Base64, they can weave these hidden characters through the entire phrase.",
      "One analyzed email decoded to \"Your Password is About to Expire\" with a soft hyphen tucked between every character. To you, it looks normal. To a security filter, it looks scrambled, with no clear keyword to match. The attackers then use the same trick in the body of the email, so both layers slide through detection. The link leads to a fake login page sitting on a compromised domain, designed to harvest your credentials.",
      "If you have ever tried spotting a phishing email, this one still follows the usual script. It builds urgency, claims something is about to expire and points you to a login page. The difference is in how neatly it dodges the filters you trust.",
      "Why this phishing technique is super dangerous",
      "Most phishing filters rely on pattern recognition. They look for suspicious words, common phrases and structure. They also scan for known malicious domains. By splitting every character with invisible symbols, attackers break up these patterns. The text becomes readable for you but unreadable for automated systems. This creates a quiet loophole where old phishing templates suddenly become effective again.",
      "The worrying part is how easy this method is to copy. The tools needed to encode these messages are widely available. Attackers can automate the process and churn out bulk campaigns with little extra effort. Since the characters are invisible in most email clients, even tech-savvy users do not notice anything odd at first glance.",
      "Security researchers point out that this method has appeared in email bodies for years, but using it in the subject line is less common. That makes it harder for existing filters to catch. Subject lines also play a key role in shaping your first impression. If the subject looks familiar and urgent, you are more likely to open the email, which gives the attacker a head start.",
      "How to spot a phishing email before you click",
      "Phishing emails often look legitimate, but the links inside them tell a different story. Scammers hide dangerous URLs behind familiar-looking text, hoping you will click without checking. One safe way to preview a link is by using a private email service that shows the real destination before your browser loads it.",
      "Our top-rated private email provider recommendation includes malicious link protection that reveals full URLs before opening them. This gives you a clear view of where a link leads before anything can harm your device. It also offers strong privacy features like no ads, no tracking, encrypted messages and unlimited disposable aliases.",

      "You do not need to become a security expert to stay safe. A few habits, paired with the right tools, can shut down most phishing attempts before they have a chance to work.",
      "A password manager helps you create strong, unique passwords for every account. Even if a phishing email fools you, the attacker cannot use your password elsewhere because each one is different. Most password managers also warn you when a site looks suspicious.",
      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our #1 password manager (see\u00a0Cyberguy.com) pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks. If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.",

It's safe to say filters and scanners are also improving, but they cannot catch everything, especially when the text they see is not the same as what you see.

Broadcom's Eric Moret shared how he nearly lost his entire Apple account after trusting what looked like official communication. He described the full experience in a detailed post on Medium, where he walked through the scam step by step.",

      "How the scam starts",
      "Moret first received a flood of alerts. These included two-factor authentication notifications that claimed someone was trying to access his iCloud account. Within minutes, he got phone calls from calm, helpful callers who claimed to be Apple agents ready to fix the issue.",
      "The twist is how convincing the entire setup felt. The scammers were able to exploit a flaw in Apple's Support system that lets anyone create a genuine support ticket without verification. They opened a real Apple Support case in his name, which triggered official emails from an Apple domain. This built instant trust and lowered Moret's guard.",
      "How scammers gained access to the account",
      "During a 25-minute call, the fake agents guided Moret through what they said would secure his account. They walked him through the steps to reset his iCloud password. They also told him a link would follow so he could close the case.",
      "That link took him to a fake site called appeal apple dot com. The page looked official and claimed his account was being secured. It then told him to enter a six-digit code sent by text to finish the process.",
      "When Moret entered that code, the scammers got exactly what they needed to sign into his account.",
      "He then got an alert that his Apple ID had been used to sign into a Mac mini he did not own. That confirmed the takeover attempt. Even though the scammer on the phone said this was normal, he trusted his instinct. He reset his password again, which kicked them out and stopped the attack.",

      "This type of scam works because it feels real. The messages look official, and the callers sound trained. Still, you can stay safer by watching out for signs that something is off.",
      "Scammers created a real-looking ticket to make the entire experience seem legitimate. You can confirm what's real by checking directly with Apple. Sign in at appleid.apple.com or open the Apple Support app to view your recent cases. If the case number isn't listed there, the message is fake, even if the email comes from an Apple domain.",
      "Never stay on a call that you did not initiate. Scammers rely on long conversations to build trust and pressure you into quick decisions. Hang up right away and call Apple Support directly at 1-800-275-2273 or through the Support app. A real agent will quickly confirm whether anything is wrong.",
      "If something feels off, look at the devices signed into your account. Go to\u00a0Settings, tap your\u00a0name and scroll to see all devices\u00a0linked to your Apple ID. Remove anything you don't recognize. This step can stop attackers fast if they've managed to get in.",
      "No real support agent will ever ask for your two-factor authentication codes. Treat any request for these codes as a major warning.",

      "Why FoloToy restored Kumma's sales after its safety review",
      "FoloToy brought Kumma back to its online store just one week after suspending sales. The fast return drew attention from parents and safety experts who wondered if the company had enough time to fix the serious issues identified in PIRG's report.",
      "FoloToy posted a detailed statement on X that laid out its version of what happened. In the post, the company said it viewed child safety as its\u00a0\"highest priority\" and that it was\u00a0\"the only company to proactively suspend sales, not only of the product mentioned in the report, but also of our other AI toys.\" FoloToy said it took this action \"immediately after the findings were published because we believe responsible action must come before commercial considerations.\"",
      "The company also emphasized to CyberGuy that it was the only one of the three AI toy startups in the PIRG review to suspend sales across all of its products and that it made this decision during the peak Christmas sales season, knowing the commercial impact would be significant. FoloToy told us, \"Nevertheless, we moved forward decisively, because we believe that responsible action must always come before commercial interests.\"",
      "The company also said it took the report's disturbing examples seriously. According to FoloToy, the issues were \"directly addressed in our internal review.\" It explained that the team\u00a0\"initiated a deep, company-wide internal safety audit,\" then \"strengthened and upgraded our content-moderation and child-safety safeguards,\" and\u00a0\"deployed enhanced safety rules and protections through our cloud-based system.\"",
      "After outlining these steps, the company said it spent the week on\u00a0\"rigorous review, testing, and reinforcement of our safety modules.\" It concluded its announcement by saying it\u00a0\"began gradually restoring product sales\" as those updated safeguards went live.",
      "FoloToy added that as global attention on AI toy risks grows,\u00a0\"transparency, responsibility and continuous improvement are essential,\" and that the company\u00a0\"remains firmly committed to building safe, age-appropriate AI companions for children and families worldwide.\"",

      "Not every model follows the same guardrails. Some include stronger filters while others may respond too freely. Look for transparent disclosures about which model powers the toy and what safety features support it.",
      "Groups like PIRG often test toys in ways parents cannot. These reviews flag hidden risks and point out behavior you may not catch during quick demos.",
      "Keep AI toys in shared spaces where you can hear or see how your child interacts with it. This helps you step in if the toy gives a concerning answer.",
      "Ask the toy questions, try creative prompts and see how it handles tricky topics. This lets you learn how it behaves before you hand it to your child.",
      "Many AI toys run on cloud systems. Updates often add stronger safeguards or reduce risky answers. Make sure the device stays current.",
      "AI toys can gather voice data, location info or behavioral patterns. A strong privacy policy should explain what is collected, how long it is stored and who can access it.",

      "The Islamic call to prayer rang out from a nearby mosque occupying an older commercial building, echoing over an empty street and through the concrete courtyards \u2014 a sound that felt both peaceful and eerie in the stillness.",
      "Men gathered outside the mosque, some wearing kufis for Friday prayers, while women passed by in hijabs and abayas \u2014 a sight still unfamiliar to many Americans, though now a regular part of daily life in Minneapolis.",
      "Faith and politics were visible here.",
      "The day before, the liveliest scene unfolded as people entered and left another mosque on a corner street, its windows boarded up, while political yard signs for mayoral candidate Omar Fateh dotted the grass outside, as did ones for Council Member Jamal Osma. Both are progressives like Ilhan Omar, who has become the community\u2019s most visible national figure.",
      "Jaylani Hussein, executive director of CAIR\u2013Minnesota, said\u00a0that faith remains central to Somali life but also serves as a bridge to their new home.",
      "\"Religion grounds us,\" he said. \"It helps us build discipline and community, and it\u2019s part of why Somalis have been able to succeed here.\"",
      "The sight of Muslim garb is a striking change for a neighborhood that was once a European immigrant enclave and, more recently, a hub for students and music lovers drawn to the University of Minnesota\u2019s West Bank and Augsburg University campuses nearby.",
      "Many of the old watering holes \u2014 like Palmer\u2019s Bar, which predates World War I \u2014 have struggled and closed amid changing demographics, shifting drinking habits and declining foot traffic. Alcohol is forbidden in Islam.",
      "Palmer\u2019s, which sits beside the commercial building-turned-mosque, has reportedly been purchased by the mosque. The congregation also bought the now-shuttered Nomad World Pub directly across the street, residents said, once a local mainstay for soccer fans and live music. In the 1990s, Minnesota had only a handful of mosques. Today, there are about 90 statewide, Hussein said.",

      "Feingold noted that while Takaichi\u2019s stance was enthusiastically received in Taiwan, the excitement \"was unsustainable and not based on a formal policy decision by Japan to defend Taiwan.\"",
      "Following reports that President Trump phoned the Japanese prime minister and requested that she dial down talk about Taiwan, Japan\u2019s Chief Cabinet Secretary Kihara Minoru issued a strong denial, saying Trump did not advise Takaichi to \"temper the tone of her comments about Taiwan.\"",

But Barros said the head of the de facto American embassy has called for bipartisan support for the bill, and he noted Lai needs only six opposition defections for the vote to pass.",
      "Analysts also stress the proposal is not solely for U.S. weapons.

      "When the color experts at Pantone announced Cloud Dancer as their 2026 Color of the Year, they predicted the shade would inspire a kind of cool calm.",
      "But the choice of Cloud Dancer, which Pantone described as a \u201cbillowy\u201d white, has instead sparked heated controversy.",
      "People online have blasted the shade for being \u201cbleak\u201d and \u201cboring\u201d and possibly not a color at all. After hearing the description of the color read during TODAY\u2019s Dec. 4 unveiling, Al Roker retorted \u201cotherwise known as white.\u201d",
      "Others have denounced Cloud Dancer as tone deaf and \u201cwhite washing,\u201d expressing other controversial takes.",
      "Read on to learn all about the controversy over Pantone's 2026 Color of the Year.",
      "What Is the Pantone Color of the Year?",
      "The Pantone Color Institute has been choosing an annual color of the year since late 1999 when it deemed Cerulean Blue 2000\u2019s Color of the Year, WWD reported. It called the soft blue shade the \u201cColor of the Millennium\u201d and said it inspired hope.",
      "The institute\u2019s color experts \u201ccomb the world looking for new color influences\u201d to choose its star shade each year, according to Pantone\u2019s website.",
      "Each year\u2019s color is influenced by everything from movies and fashion to art and travel destinations, and more. Colors are also inspired by lifestyle trends, new technologies, sports and socio-economic conditions.",
      "Additionally, a Pantone spokesperson tells TODAY.com, \u201cThe Pantone Color of the Year selection process is driven by the color/colors that are bubbling up across design and tying this to the zeitgeist.  The emotional resonance inherent in the color is key to the selection process.\u201d",
      "Other companies like Benjamin Moore and WGSN also choose an annual color of the year. The paint company chose Silhouette AF-655, a \u201cluxurious burnt umber with delicate notes of charcoal\u201d as its 2026 color. WGSN opted for Transformative Teal, the color \u201cfor a period of change and redirection.\u201d",
      "What Is Pantone's 2026 Color of the Year?",
      "When Pantone announced Cloud Dancer as its 2026 pick, it described the color as \u201ca billowy, balanced white\u201d that\u2019s \u201cimbued with a feeling of serenity.\u201d",
      "Like a blank slate, the \u201cethereal\u201d Cloud Dancer is a symbol of a \u201ccalming influence in a frenetic society\u201d and signifies our desire to make a fresh start, the company stated.",
      "The color also hints at \u201cour search for balance between our digital future and our primal need for human connection,\u201d said Laurie Pressman, the Pantone Color Institute\u2019s vice president.",
      "Why Is the Choice Controversial?",
      "Though Pantone described Cloud Dancer as a serene color, it inspired a red-hot response after it was chosen as 2026's Color of the Year.",
      "While some people \u2014 including wedding planners on TikTok \u2014 celebrated the choice, many others found Cloud Dancer oddly bleak, or worse.",
      "\u201cYour choice is about as inspired as mayonnaise,\u201d one person wrote next to Pantone\u2019s announcement about Cloud Dancer on Instagram.",
      "\u201cPantonedeaf,\u201d another added, while one person commented, \u201cIt seems as if this selection, and the content created around it, was conceived in a vacuum completely removed from our collective social and political present. I\u2019d hope a brand that has this much cultural impact wouldn\u2019t operate with such a glaring blind spot.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s giving unseasoned chicken,\u201d jabbed another.",
      "When a Washington Post reporter asked for feedback about Cloud Dancer in a TikTok video, users didn't hold back.",
      "One person called the color \u201cbleak\u201d and \u201cdystopian,\" writing, \u201cThe color of the year is no color. Just another example of the life being sucked out of us all.\u201d",
      "Another said its \u201clack of color\u201d was a \u201crecession indicator,\u201d joking, \u201cPantone can\u2019t afford color this year and neither can anyone else.\u201d",
      "With headlines all year reporting on the rise of white nationalism in the United States, many critics saw the choice of Cloud Dancer as either \u201ctone deaf\u201d or biased.",
      "\u201cSO\u2026 you all sat down and had some meetings. Rolled around some ideas. And in all those meetings, not a single one of you\u2026 in this moment where white supremacy is in the news everyday\u2026. thought, \u2018maybe now isn\u2019t the right time for this,\u2019\u201d one person wrote on Pantone\u2019s Instagram.",
      "\u201cWas \u2018klanrobe white\u2019 taken?\u201d added someone else.",
      "How Has Pantone Responded to the Controversy?",
      "Pressman addressed speculation that proclaiming white the color of the year could raise some eyebrows in an interview with Washington Post.",
      "\u201cSkin tones did not factor into this at all,\u201d Pressman said, noting Pantone has been asked similar questions in the past about other color picks. \u201cWith Peach Fuzz and then with Mocha Mousse, people were weighing in and asking if this was about skin tones. And I think we were going, \u2018Wow, really?\u2019 Because for us it\u2019s really about, at such a basic level, what are people looking for that color can hope to answer?\"",
      "During a Dec. 4 launch event, Pantone\u2019s president, Sky Kelley, said she knew Cloud Dancer would be a \u201cpretty controversial\u201d choice.",
      "Pantone\u2019s pick, she said in a speech caught on video by CNET, \u201csparks a conversation about color that everyone can participate in.\u201d",
      "She added, \u201cAt Pantone, we don\u2019t dictate that conversation, we facilitate it.\u201d",
      "In a statement to TODAY.com, a Pantone spokesperson also explained the meaning behind the color\u2019s name.",
      "\u201cCloud Dancer visually represents a space to create, like a blank page ready for you to turn your inspiration into reality,\u201d the spokesperson said, in part. \u201cIt gives us the ability to become receptive both to what can be and what\u2019s ahead as Cloud Dancer suggests the inner peace we feel after clearing the noise around us.\u201d",
      "Explaining that the name plays a major role to \u201cconjure up a feeling,\u201d the spokesperson said that Cloud Dancer \u201creflects a universally shared experience: wherever we are in the world, we all look up to the buoyant clouds for inspiration, wonder, and to spark imagination.\u201d",
      "Adding, \u201cIn the simple act of looking up, we\u2019re connected by the drifting lightness of clouds. That universality is a huge part of why Cloud Dancer was selected as the Pantone Color of the Year 2026.\u201d"

      "Jenna only has one sister, her twin Barbara, who she also affectionately calls sissy, but Handler has long been an honorary member of the family.

She regularly did Pilates with Barbara, who invited her to play pickleball one day at the family compound.",

      "After a few appearances on Season 1, now, Suero is taking the spotlight in the newest episodes, showing how she brings her bilingual, Dominican culture and go-getter one-liners to Ryan Serhant\u2019s real estate company, SERHANT.",
      "After immigrating to the U.S. at the age of 13 with her father, Suero put herself through college, earning a business and journalism degree. She says she worked multiple jobs, including eventually at Bloomingdale's, where one client told her that if Suero \u201ccan sell a cream to my husband, you can sell anyone a building.\u201d",
      "She\u2019s now been in the real estate game for eight years, four of them with SERHANT, on Nile Lundgren\u2019s team.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m just a little immigrant girl that came to this country with lots of dreams,\u201d Suero expresses in the sixth episode of Season 2.",
      "Suero tells TODAY.com that her stable real estate job, as well as coming in third place in the reality beauty pageant show \u201cNuestra Belleza Latina\u201d and landing a correspondent gig at Telemundo\u2019s \u201cEn Casa Con Telemundo,\u201d has since afforded her the opportunity to bring her mother to the states.",
      "In Season 2 of \u201cOwning Manhattan,\u201d Suero brings charisma, a hard work ethic, and saz\u00f3n to the table \u2014 as well as some famous faces...and some confrontations.",
      "\u201cI really don\u2019t like drama, but the drama comes to me!\u201d Suero says.",
      "Below, she chats with TODAY.com about what's really real about the real estate show, how she handles haters and more.",
      "This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.",
      "Thank you, and this is why I went to the Bronx, too, in the show. When I started in the (real estate) business, I wasn\u2019t going back and forth with Spanglish. Then when I (started working) in the Bronx, I\u2019m like, \u201cOK, I can speak Spanish here.\u201d Finally, when I came to SERHANT... I\u2019m like, \u201cOK, I feel comfortable here.\u201d I think I can truly be Genesis and show my Dominican, Latina essence in this place. I can be loud, I can scream. I can be intense, because you got to be intense to make it happen in New York. New York is not an easy city.",
      "I have always been like this. What you see on the show, what you're getting in this interview, is me.",
      "Well, I\u2019m glad that you went to my website and checked my SERHANT (page), because you can see all my deals. You can look up my license, you can see my client testimonials, which are there. And there\u2019s so many testimonials that need to be published that haven\u2019t, because I\u2019m running around. I\u2019ve been at SERHANT for four years, doing deals and moving on. I haven\u2019t even had the chance to sign the company's deal wall yet, because I do the deals, move on, follow up with my clients, and film \u201cOwning Manhattan,\u201d all at the same time also working for Telemundo. I\u2019m constantly moving. So it's real.",
      "I really don't like drama, but the drama comes to me! (Laughs.) If it comes to me, it's giving me a (story)line. But this specific drama caught me off guard. And as you can see, I proved her wrong, because I did not touch that client.",
      "I have worked so hard for many years, at Dominican restaurants, at the supermarket, at Bloomingdale's. In real estate, that kind of accusation is a little frightening. When someone comes to you with those accusations, knowing that you did not do that...I have all the proof. If you\u2019re going to accuse someone, you got to make sure that you got all the proof before you point fingers, because you don\u2019t know how hard the other person has been building their castle, brick by brick. So it's a real storyline. And I\u2019m there, debunking it.",
      "As an immigrant woman in New York, it\u2019s very hard to give people the time of day \u2014 your space, your energy, to make you feel down. But when it comes to something that you have been building for so many years \u2014 once again, I will go back to being an immigrant woman. As someone who has started from the bottom and then you get people that have had half of the struggle that you have endured in this wonderful country, you tend to question yourself. \u201cAm I presenting myself correctly to the world with what I\u2019m building? Am I speaking correctly, since English is my second language? Are they understanding my personality? Do they know about my culture?\u201d And the more they did it, honestly, it got to a boiling point where I felt a little overwhelmed.",
      "And now, it is time to show the world that behind the strong Dominican-Latina, there is a woman that has lots of feelings. Any human when others attempt to bring her down, to demean the work that she has done for years, it will hurt her, because real estate and my career at Telemundo are my babies. I'm gonna protect them from everyone. Como una mam\u00e1 leona. Voy con u\u00f1as y dientes...",
      "(In Spanish) But you get up \u2014 and I think we should be a little mischievous too. I\u2019m going to show them how I feel, but I\u2019m also going to f--- with them.",
      "I'm very close with Jessica Markowski, Jade (Shenker), Nile, of course, Ryan, and Peter (Zaitzeff).",
      "I want to tell you something. Liz, you as a fellow Latina, if they don\u2019t like me, that\u2019s their problem. I like all of them (laughs). There\u2019s nothing I can do to change your feelings if that\u2019s how you feel. I can control my emotions. I cannot control yours.",
      "I have interviewed Nicky Jam in the past, and we had great chemistry. He wanted to buy a building next to my office many years ago and he didn\u2019t. So when he started searching again, his publicist Kanessa Tixe contacted me. I said, \u201cGreat, this is the perfect client for me to show my lovers, \u2018my haters,\u2019 what I bring to the table.\" So it is not fake news or a storyline, but a real client who is qualified. It was also a way to show the world that Latinos are buying real estate.",
      "Latinos are not only spending on clothes and looking nice. Latinos now are building generational wealth, and one of the many assets that can help you build generational wealth is real estate, among many others. But Nicky Jam has decided to go the real estate route. He has many places in Miami and Latin America, and I am blessed that he decided that I was the broker he was going to work with in New York... He trusts me, a fellow Latina who has the knowledge and who can explain things to him in English and Spanish. It cannot get better than that!",
      "A lot of people get scared of the price tag. As a woman that came to this country thinking that all these luxury buildings were either offices or owned by the government or tourist attractions, when I learned that you can live inside these properties and how much they cost, I had to work on realizing that I belonged there, too.",
      "Although I wasn\u2019t born in this country and I\u2019m not from a big real estate family in New York, I know that I belong in those price ranges. What I did was I paid my dues.",
      "I started building my career and working very hard from selling properties of $100,000 to selling million-dollar properties. I did not let the price tag bring my confidence down and take my seat out of that table. I knew I could have a seat at that table.",
      "That is a question that many people ask me. With English being my second language and me having an accent, and it's very easy to mispronounce things... But I think Latinos are born with a flame inside.",
      "Latinos are born with a sparkle that gets ignited by having the opportunity to come to this country that offers people \u2014 and hard working and ambitious people \u2014 a better life, a better education. I think we are born with our spark... That comes out as being confident because we're not afraid of anything because we have gone through so much, and the only option we have is to be confident and to show the world that we can take on any challenge and make it happen. Doesn't matter the field, real estate, medicine, teacher, finance, politicians, designers...we just have it inside us."

      "Kim Kardashian says she doesn't blame her childhood friend Simone Harouche for not running to her rescue during her 2016 Paris robbery.",
      "On Season 7, Episode 7, of \"The Kardashians,\" the Skims founder recalled the horrific night when a group of people robbed her at gunpoint and made off with millions worth of jewelry.",
      "On the show, Kardashian and her family members explained that they were all in Paris that night for Fashion Week and said the robbery happened when most of them left to spend a night out on the town.",
      "When the robbery happened, Kardashian said she was getting ready to go to sleep while Harouche stayed downstairs in the lower level of the hotel, which had a \"doorman and a gate.\u201d",
      "\"Then you see everyone leaving me for the night and little did all the robbers know that Simone was really with me and stayed back with me,\" she said. \"Everyone thought I was by myself, but Simone was downstairs.\"",
      "Kardashian said the robbers got into her room with the help of the concierge, who was held at gunpoint. She said she feared for her life and thought she was going to get sexually assaulted since she was only wearing a bathrobe.",
      "The reality TV star said the robbers tied her up and took all her jewels, which she corroborated during courtroom testimony in 2025.",
      "Harouche, who heard all the commotion downstairs, said she feared for her friend, who she's known since she was 12 years old.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m scared that something bad is happening to her upstairs so it\u2019s just overwhelming. My friend is screaming and you\u2019re thinking that they\u2019re violating her and I\u2019m thinking that I\u2019m next,\" she said.",
      "After taking the stand at the trial, Harouche gave Kardashian some insight as to the questions that she was asked and said she had to explain why she didn't run to Kardashian's rescue during the burglary.",
      "\"I can't believe that anyone would even think that it was her responsibility to come up in the middle of what she knew to be a scary situation, hearing me cry and scream,\" Kardashian said in a confessional. \"Imagine hearing that and then she's just going to walk up and be like, hey, what's going on? And try to break it up or think that she could.\"",
      "\"Thank God you didn't come up,\" she told Harouche in person in front of her glam team. \"Simone is very frantic. I think she wouldn't have known what to do and in an emergency situation, It's just like, great, she didn't come out. She would've had us killed, seriously.\"",
      "In a confessional, Kardashian said she thinks that the robbery would've been a lot of worse if the robbers \"heard noise downstairs\" or \"thought someone else was there.\"",
      "\"They had no clue she was there and she was able to hear it all and call for help and be there the second they left,\" she said. \"And that was the best decision she ever made. And had she come up, we would've died, for sure.\""

      "They interrupted anchor Tom Llamas and his crew from their hard work for a merry moment.",
      "\"What is this?\" Llamas asked.",
      "\"This is Christmas, Llamas!\" Al said.",
      "The final tree delivery went across the building to Clarkson, the Grammy-winning singer and Emmy-winning talk show host.",
      "Clarkson was sitting behind her desk as the jolly TODAY crew entered singing \"Jingle Bells.\"",
      "\"Aww, I love it!\" Clarkson said. \"I love that you all came!\"",
      "They presented her with the tree and made sure to leave some festive green-and-red boughs to decorate her Emmy statues."

I tried to leave a message but as usual your voicemail was full,\u201d Paulson read. \u201cAs usual, I called, as usual, your mailbox is full. As usual, I don\u2019t want to write a message. As usual, I wanna see your face. As usual, I\u2019m leaving town or you\u2019re leaving town, all as usual.\u201d",

I want to tell you how much crummier the world is without you in it. I want to tell you everything that happened in my life in the 54 days since you\u2019ve been gone.\u201d",

      "She says a scenario could involve one person raising their voice and becoming too intense while the other shuts down and withdraws.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re not seeing two people lean in with empathy and engagement with each other,\u201d she explains.",
      "So, she says a relationship in which two people don\u2019t argue could have two different types of dynamic: One that is healthy and one that isn\u2019t.",
      "The unhealthy dynamic is conflict avoidance, she says. \u201cWe see this when we have certain insecure attachment styles that pair up together, that are both afraid of conflict. Instead of actually bringing up their needs or bringing up what feels bad to them or what they would like to see changed in the relationship, they just stay silent and shut it down,\u201d she says.",
      "She cautions that this could cause one person to harbor resentment, leading to other problems in the future. If both partners are conflict avoidant, then they are never really working through their issues.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re simply avoiding the hard discussions because they\u2019re afraid of being vulnerable, or maybe they\u2019re afraid of being rejected or that their partner is going to get triggered and have a poor response to their needs,\u201d Hensley adds.",
      "Although there can be a multitude of reasons for being conflict avoidant, the expert says that she sees that type of behavior often with insecurely attached people.",
      "Alternatively, she says two securely attached people could work through disagreements without arguing or becoming emotionally dysregulated. Instead, the two could react with respect and empathy for each other.",
      "\"I think the healthiest types of responses are ones in which we can stay calm and respectful, but if we do have some arguing, where people do get a little bit heated, as long as there\u2019s proper repair, the relationship can still stay relatively healthy, and we can still build more trust and safety over time,\" she says.",
      "As for George Clooney mentioning his age as one of the reasons he doesn\u2019t argue with his wife, Hensley says she has seen that trend in older couples, especially those who have been together for a long time.",
      "\u201cAs people age, a lot of times, if they\u2019re very self aware, they will have done the inner work to get to a place where they\u2019re not very argumentative inside of their relationship. That\u2019s different than conflict avoidance,\u201d she says.",
      "If couples are struggling with conflict avoidance, Hensley suggests focusing on nervous system work and somatic processing to become comfortable with their emotions.",
      "\u201cBeing able to focus on learning healthy emotional processing will allow you to feel more comfortable with other people\u2019s emotions, and it\u2019s not going to feel like receiving somebody else\u2019s emotions is automatically a criticism or something to be upset or dysregulated about,\u201d she advises.",
      "Hensley emphasizes the importance of being aware of your attachment style and not assuming incompatibility is the reason a relationship fails.",
      "\u201cWorking on your attachment and the things that come with insecure attachment, like your comfort with being vulnerable, your ability to process your emotions and your ability to stay objective is really important. But a lot of people just don\u2019t know what they don\u2019t know,\u201d she says.",
      "If a partner\u2019s blueprint is dysfunctional, then their relationships will be negatively impacted.",
      "\u201cInvestigate attachment and focus on your own attachment security,\u201d she encourages. \u201cThat\u2019s going to be the best way to have a healthy relationship in the future.\u201d"

      "\u200bLoughlin appeared as Stanton on the second season of the spin-off series \u201cWhen Hope Calls\u201d on Great American Family in 2021. She followed that with a role in the romantic comedy \u201cFall Into Winter\u201d on the same network in 2023.",

      "\u201cMy advice is to just keep moving forward. Everyone has good times and bad times,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s life. I think you just have to pick yourself up. Nobody said life was going to be a breeze. There\u2019s beauty in life, but there\u2019s also hardship in life.\u201d",

      "Sabrina Carpenter is revealing exactly what she wanted her controversial \u201cMan\u2019s Best Friend\u201d album cover to convey.",
      "The \u201cTears\u201d singer, 26, came under fire in June when she teased the album's cover photo ahead of its Aug. 29 release. The image, which shows Carpenter on her hands and knees as a man standing behind her grabs a fistful of her hair, was blasted as degrading to women.",
      "Carpenter released a second image at the time of a dog wearing a tag with the words \u201cMan\u2019s Best Friend\u201d inscribed on it.",
      "In a new interview with Variety, Carpenter, who was named the publication\u2019s Hitmaker of the Year, said the album cover, to her, explored the duality of control and shared how she personally relates to that theme.",
      "\u201cYou can be so in control and so not in control at the same time,\" the singer explained.",
      "\u201cIt was about how people try to control women, and how I felt emotionally yanked around by these relationships that I had, and how much power you\u2019re allowing yourself to give them,\u201d she added.",
      "Carpenter said she looked at the uproar around the image as simply a difference of opinion.",
      "\u201cIt meant one thing to me and 100 things to other people, and I was looking at it going, \u2018That\u2019s valid. Mine\u2019s valid. What\u2019s for dinner?\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cNot to bypass the weight that it did carry for some people. I saw it and was like, \u2018That is a great point. It wasn\u2019t the point I was trying to make.\u2019\u201d",
      "As the backlash to her provocative album cover raged, Carpenter released a second version of \"Man's Best Friend\" featuring an alternative cover.",
      "That cover featured a black-and-white photo of Carpenter slow dancing with a man in a suit, a callback to a classic shot of screen legend Marilyn Monroe and her third husband, playwright Arthur Miller.",
      "Carpenter cheekily assured naysayers the new cover was \"approved by God\" when she announced it June 25 on Instagram.",
      "During the interview with Variety, Carpenter denied the alternative cover was a concession to her critics. \u201cOh, girl,\u201d she said. \u201cI just wanted to take more pictures!\u201d",
      "\"The (original cover) really says it all,\" she added, \"even though it\u2019s maybe not what you want me to say.\"",
      "In September, Carpenter told NPR she was \"surprised\" by the controversy sparked by her original cover.",
      "\"I think mostly because when I thought about making this album cover, I was really inspired by a man sort of delicately playing with my hair,\" she said. \"Because I think there were a lot of metaphors between this dog and me emotionally. You know, a man\u2019s best friend and sort of all the implications that that comes with it, the power in dominance and submission.",
      "\"When I saw it, obviously for me, it checked all the boxes in between my friends and family,\" she added at the time. \"It just felt like what the music sounds like.\""

      "Miley Cyrus and her longtime boyfriend Maxx Morando are taking the next step in their relationship.",
      "After four years of dating, the couple recently got engaged, as confirmed by The New York Times.",
      "Cyrus, 33, showed off her engagement ring at the Los Angeles premiere of \"Avatar: Fire and Ash\" while posing on the red carpet with Morando, a 27-year-old music producer and drummer for the band Liily.",
      "Jacquie Aiche designed the ring, TODAY.com can confirm.",
      "The ring appears to feature a cushion-cut diamond between four and five carats, according to jewelry experts TODAY.com interviewed.",
      "Laura Taylor, a jeweler specializing in engagement and wedding rings at Lorel Diamonds, says cushion-cut diamonds have a \u201cromantic, vintage feel\u201d and are known for \u201csoft corners and broad facets that catch the light with flashes rather than sparkle.\u201d",
      "It's set in a chunky gold design, which Taylor says has been \"making a return\" among celebrities \u2013\u00a0see: Dua Lipa's recent engagement ring.",
      "The diamond is surrounded by gold, rather than set in prongs, also known as a bezel-style setting.",
      "\"Not only does this keep the stone more secure, but it also helps it stand out even more,\u201d Taylor notes.",
      "The pairing of a classic cushion-cut diamond with the bezel setting gives it a \"modern, sculptural look,\" which suits Cyrus' style, Taylor says.",
      "The ring aligns with Cyrus' brand and sense of style for other reasons, jewelers say.",
      "Ashleigh Bergman, the founder of Milestones by Ashleigh Bergman, says while the setting is classic, it's not \"classically bridal\" \u2014\u00a0which \"conversely makes it super modern.\"",
      "\"It\u2019s edgy (for bridal), but clean,\" she says.",
      "Page Neal, co-founder of Bario Neal, calls the ring \"modern, unfussy, bold, and deeply self-assured.\"",
      "\u201cIt has the feeling of a piece chosen for the present moment in her life, not an echo of the past,\u201d Neal says.",
      "Neal sees the ring speaking to various trends within the jewelry space, including a shift toward elongated shapes like ovals and marquises; east-west settings and the rise of low, wearable profiles.",
      "Jewelers who spoke to TODAY.com estimate the ring costing between $100,000 and $500,000, depending on factors like provenance of the stone, color, clarity and carat size.",
      "While speaking with People, Cyrus offered the following thoughts on her engagement.",
      "\u201cThe detail that I can share is that for us, our privacy and us kind of keeping it small has been something that I\u2019ve been astounded that I\u2019ve actually been able to have and being able to kind of have more choice,\u201d she says.",
      "Cyrus also explained why she thinks she and Morando have mostly been able to avoid the spotlight, saying, \u201cI think it\u2019s also being older, being more protective of what I\u2019m open to sharing.\u201d"

    "summary": "After a quiet start, Pope Leo XI, the first American pontiff appears to have found his voice on his trip to Turkey and Lebanon.",
    "story": [
      "After a quiet start, the first American pope appears to be finding his voice.",
      "During his debut foreign trip, to Turkey and Lebanon, Pope Leo XIV projected a papal brand more guarded and less polarizing than that of his predecessor, Pope Francis.",
      "But many Vatican watchers have nonetheless been impressed with his ability to deliver powerful messages \u2014 particularly on issues such as climate change, artificial intelligence, poverty and immigration \u2014 albeit in a subtler way than the man he replaced.",
      "\u201cPope Leo is certainly growing into the role,\u201d said Massimo Faggioli, a world-leading Vatican expert and professor at Trinity College Dublin. \u201cHe has resisted the temptation to give a sound bite that\u2019s easy to use as a headline,\u201d but \u201cwhen he speaks, he says things that are quite courageous.\u201d",
      "For all the warm reviews, some Vatican watchers have sounded a note of caution: Leo has yet to stake out concrete positions, let alone sharp critiques, on any major issue. Doing so will almost certainly mean disappointing at least one faction in this church of 1.4 billion that he has so deftly kept onside.",
      "Raised in Chicago, Leo, 70, spent much of his working life in Peru, before he was a surprise choice for pope at April\u2019s conclave following the death of Francis. His lower profile meant \u201che was a bit of a mystery\u201d for many Catholics, and he had \u201ca very quiet summer\u201d of study and preparation, Faggioli said.",
      "That started to change as the colder months arrived, with more outspoken comments including his call last month for \u201cdeep reflection\u201d about the treatment of detained migrants in the United States.",
      "On Tuesday, as he held a Mass in Beirut, which was attended by an estimated 150,000 people, Leo honored a promise made by Francis, who was prevented from visiting by his late-life illness.",
      "Leo asked \u201cGod for the gift of peace for this beloved land, marked by instability, wars and suffering,\u201d likely a reference to the recent Israel-Hezbollah war, the fallout from a colossal portside explosion in 2020 that killed more than 200 people, and the country\u2019s roiling economic crisis.",
      "Though more than half of the Lebanese population is Muslim, nearly one third are Christian and 5% Catholic, according to 2022 census data. Before Lebanon, Leo visited Turkey to mark the anniversary of the foundation of the Nicene Creed, the standard statement of what all Christians \u2014 Catholics, Protestants and Orthodox \u2014 believe, including the affirmation that Jesus was the son of God.",
      "That highlighted one of the themes of the six-day trip, which was reaching out \u201cboth to other Christian groups, but also to the government of Turkey, and, by extension, to Muslims,\u201d according to Miles Pattenden, a historian of the Catholic Church who teaches at the University of Oxford.",
      "That\u2019s just one of the ways Leo has followed Francis\u2019 relatively progressive policies and views \u2014 \u201cbut he\u2019s done so with a very different tone and in a different way,\u201d Pattenden said.",
      "Though both men warned against the risks associated with AI, the tech-savvy Leo is the first pontiff \u201cwho seems at ease with the modern world\u201d and pop culture, Pattenden added.",
      "His down-to-earth vibe makes his papacy seem like \u201ca sitcom in which some nice geek from the Midwest in America suddenly found that he had become pope,\u201d Pattenden said. \u201cHe\u2019s got this smile that suggests he himself can\u2019t quite believe it.\u201d",
      "Leo is known to read his speeches word-for-word, a drastic departure from Francis\u2019 habit of going off script. That led to several high-profile faux pas that sent his aides into damage limitation mode.",
      "\u201cTheir gestures and outreach are similar,\u201d said Stan Chu Ilo, a Catholic studies professor at DePaul University in Chicago. \u201cBut Pope Francis was quite evidently gregarious and extroverted in nature, whereas the reserved Pope Leo seems quite effective though in communication and has clarity in his thought.\u201d",
      "Even when sticking to his lines, Francis\u2019 pointed and specific pronouncements led to clashes with other world officials, like when he challenged the U.S. on climate change and called for an investigation into whether Israel had committed genocide in Gaza.",
      "Leo has said he supports the two-state solution between Israel and the Palestinian territories but told reporters on the plane to Lebanon that \u201cwe are friends with Israel.\u201d",
      "During his trip this week, Leo \u201cspoke and acted very carefully, as if every sentence had been carefully weighted and coined, to avoid misunderstanding or blunt declaration,\u201d said Olivier Roy, a professor at the European University Institute.",
      "And the new pope was well received by many in Lebanon, a country still being bombed by Israel. Just a week before Leo landed in Beirut, an Israeli airstrike on the city killed Haytham Ali Tabatabai, a senior Hezbollah commander, and four other people, while injuring 28 more.",

      "Nearby, Moussa Abdayem, a yoga instructor, said he hoped the pope \u201cwill inspire us to live in a more peaceful way\u201d in a country where \u201ceverybody\u2019s angry\u201d at the swirling crises besetting his nation.",
      "They aren\u2019t the only ones impressed by Leo\u2019s approach. His centrist stance appears to have calmed divisions between Catholic liberals and conservatives, some of the latter enraged by what they saw as Francis\u2019 abandonment of liturgical traditions such as the Latin mass.",
      "However, occupying such a middle ground does not come without risks.",
      "The closest Leo came to criticism or censure of anyone or anything was making \u201ca heartfelt appeal to those who hold political and social authority, here and in all countries marked by war and violence.\u201d",
      "He told them, \"Listen to the cry of your peoples who are calling for peace!\u201d"

    "summary": "The Beirut port explosion and the economic collapse that followed led some Maronite Catholics to leave Lebanon. Pope Leo's Lebanon visit has renewed hope.",
    "story": [
      "BEIRUT \u2014 Holy icons no longer witness Mass at St. Anthony of Padua Catholic Church in the Lebanese capital and there are no pews five years after an explosion in the main port sent a devastating shock wave through the city.",
      "While new slabs of white marble have replaced the old floor and the walls are freshly painted, the Rev. Miled Abboud is hopeful that Pope Leo XIV\u2019s visit to the blast site Tuesday will highlight the amount of rebuilding that still needs to be done. He also believes Leo's visit will bring \u201ca message of hope\u201d and reconciliation between Lebanon\u2019s diverse Christian communities \u2014 a large number of whom have left in recent years \u2014 and coexistence with the majority Muslim population.",
      "\u201cThe pope\u2019s visit is a sign of hope,\u201d Abboud told NBC News on Saturday. \u201cThere are a lot of bleak things, of things that make us despair, but we have Christ who gives us strength to carry on.\u201d",
      "Abboud, who said he had only been a priest at this Maronite church for a few months, added that he hoped to restore it to its former glory to inspire the local community, although many younger members of his congregation have left the city or country altogether, largely because of the dire economy.",
      "\u201cThe majority of young people have moved to other regions or to the Gulf, to Europe, to France, because we have a lot of French universities here, so once they finish their studies, people move to France,\u201d he said.",
      "Many of them took the decision to leave in the aftermath of the massive August 2020 port explosion, which tore through Beirut after hundreds of tons of ammonium nitrate detonated in a warehouse, according to Paul Salem, a senior fellow at the Middle East Institute, a Washington-based think tank.",
      "In total, 218 people were killed and 7,000 others wounded by the blast which devastated large swaths of the city, causing billions of dollars in damages.",
      "Much of the destruction was in \u201cmajority Christian neighborhoods of east Beirut,\u201d Salem said in a series of voice notes Monday. For some it was \u201cthe last straw,\u201d he added.",
      "As much as people loved their homeland, he said, the explosion \u201ctraumatized so many\u201d in the country, which was already reeling from an economic collapse and struggling to cope with an influx of around 1.5 million refugees who crossed into Lebanon as civil war-ravaged neighboring Syria. Some have returned to their country since the overthrow of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad last year.",
      "Pointing out that members of Christian populations have a long history of migration \u201cfrom the Middle East to the West from the 19th century,\u201d Salem said \u201cthey were attracted to and feel comfortable going to the West, which is generally Christian.\u201d",
      "But, he said, both Christians and Muslims had left during the civil war which wracked the country between 1975 and 1990 and the war with Israel in 2006.",
      "After the economic collapse, he said, \u201cthere weren\u2019t great jobs in Lebanon but there were in Dubai, Abu Dhabi or Riyadh or further afield in Canada or the U.S.\u201d Others had left to pursue higher education in the West, he added.",
      "More recently, the country has been rocked by the spillover of Israel's war in Gaza and also the war between Israel and the Lebanese Shia Muslim militant group Hezbollah until a fragile ceasefire was brokered around a year ago.",
      "But just a week before Leo landed in Beirut, an Israeli airstrike on the city killed Haytham Ali Tabatabai, a senior Hezbollah commander, and four other people, while injuring 28 more.",
      "Elsewhere, some Syrian Christians have left their country amid concerns about the new government under interim President Ahmad al-Sharaa, former leader of the Islamist insurgent group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham. In June, an unprecedented terrorist attack in Damascus on the Greek Orthodox Mar Elias Church during Mass killed at least 30 people and injured 54.",
      "Large numbers had already fled the country, as well as neighboring Iraq, after the Islamic State militant group, or ISIS, declared a caliphate.",
      "In Gaza, the small surviving Christian community has seen churches shelled and worshippers killed during Israel\u2019s war with Hamas, while in the occupied West Bank, Christian communities have been targeted by Israeli settlers and the economy has suffered as tourists' numbers have dropped dramatically.",
      "While Lebanese Christians have lived in relative peace in the Muslim-majority country, the country\u2019s dire economic situation has led many to seek a new life abroad.",
      "\u201cNo one wants to leave their home, especially if their home has been passed down for thousands of years and people have fought for that home to stay there. But we also want to live here with dignity,\u201d Giovanni Lteif, 21, told NBC News in an interview Saturday.",
      "Together with his twin, Charbel Lteif, he has set up \u201cEastern Christians\u201d pages on social media, which have racked up almost 700,000 followers.",
      "\u201cOne of the biggest problems we are facing is how many Christians have left,\u201d Charbel Lteif said, adding that with their videos they were trying to raise awareness and preserve their culture and traditions by creating \u201ca new voice for the Christians in the Middle East and North Africa, a voice that is not political, a voice that is not for anyone\u2019s agenda, a voice that is from the Christians of the East to the whole world.\u201d",
      "Charbel Lteif said churches were \u201cstill very alive,\u201d in Lebanon which has the largest percentage of Christians in the Middle East, making up over a third of the population.",
      "A power sharing agreement has been in place since Lebanon gained independence from France in 1943 in which the president is a Maronite Christian, the parliament speaker is a Shia Muslim and the prime minister is a Sunni Muslim.",
      "This makes Lebanon the only Arab country with a Christian head of state, a tradition that continued earlier this year when President Joseph Aoun, Prime Minister Nawaf Salam and a Cabinet were elected on reformist platforms and vowed to hold those behind the port explosion to account.",
      "Five years on from the blast, no official has been convicted, and years of obstructions by top officials have stalled an investigation and hampered hopes for justice.",
      "With no centralized effort by the Lebanese government to rebuild the surrounding neighborhoods, many families and business owners used their own money to fix their properties or reached out to charities and grassroots initiatives.",
      "At St. Anthony of Padua, Abboud remained hopeful that it would be restored to its former glory.",
      "\u201cWhen the church is closed, it means we\u2019ve lost a piece of our region,\u201d he said. \u201cI say this as a Christian who truly believes we have a mission with our Muslim brothers: a mission of dialogue, a mission of coexistence, of making peace.\u201d"

      "The body of just one Israeli hostage remains in Gaza, nearing the fulfillment of a key plank of President Donald Trump\u2019s 20-point ceasefire plan for the enclave, but major hurdles exist to a planned second phase.",
      "Doubts remain over whether negotiators can overcome those obstacles, even as they face renewed pressure to advance into Phase 2 \u2014 a step intended to prevent any return to the high levels of violence that preceded the ceasefire.",
      "Trump noted last week that Phase 2 would commence \u201cpretty soon,\u201d without giving a more specific timetable. Axios reported Thursday that the White House is hoping to announce the second phase before Christmas and unveil the new governance structure for the enclave, citing two U.S. officials and a Western source directly involved in the process.",
      "Phase 2 of Trump\u2019s plan calls for the establishment of a new governing mechanism in Gaza, the disarmament of Hamas and the formation of an international stabilization force, known as the ISF, that would take over responsibility from the Israel Defense Forces currently occupying parts of the Gaza Strip.",
      "Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani, whose country has played a key role in a series of international negotiations, said Saturday that discussions were at a \u201ccritical\u201d moment. Mediators were working jointly to push the next phase of the ceasefire forward, he said during a panel at the Doha Forum conference in Qatar.",
      "\u201cA ceasefire cannot be completed unless there is a full withdrawal of Israeli forces, [until] there is stability back in Gaza, people can go in and out, which is not the case today,\u201d he said.",
      "Egypt\u2019s Foreign Minister Badr Abdelatty told the conference that the international stabilization force was needed \u201cas soon as possible on the ground,\u201d while Norway\u2019s Foreign Minister Espen Barth Eide said measures must be put in place this month, warning the current ceasefire \u201ccannot hold for many more weeks in its current phase.\u201d",
      "As the international community hopes for progress, the ceasefire\u2019s trajectory so far underscores both its fragile gains and its persistent vulnerabilities.",
      "Since the ceasefire came into effect on Oct. 10, 20 living hostages and the remains of 27 others have been returned to Israel. The body of the final hostage, Ran Gvili, a 24-year-old police officer killed during Hamas\u2019 Oct. 7, 2023, attack, has yet to be recovered despite a weekslong search effort. Israeli authorities have steadily released Palestinian prisoners and detainees \u2014 both living and dead \u2014 as part of the exchange.",
      "Israel has repeatedly said all hostages must be returned before a Phase 2 deal, with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu this week stressing the need for an \u201cintensive and immediate effort\u201d to complete the commitment.",
      "Israel agreed to halt its assault on the Gaza Strip during the ceasefire, but flare-ups and violence have persisted, with Israeli strikes killing more than 350 people since the ceasefire began, taking the death toll in the enclave beyond 70,000, according to Palestinian Health Ministry figures.",
      "The first phase also included a commitment to expand the flow of aid into Gaza, but U.N. experts say the number of trucks permitted to enter has never reached the agreed target of 600 per day.",
      "Israel said Gaza\u2019s Rafah crossing in the south will soon reopen to allow Palestinians to enter Egypt, but it will not reopen the crossing in both directions \u2014 another commitment under the deal \u2014 until Gvili\u2019s remains are returned.",
      "And as Phase 1 sputters along, analysts warn that Phase 2 presents a host of complex challenges, from security arrangements to competing governance demands, that could slow or even stall the process.",
      "Negotiators are \u201ctrying to square circles that simply cannot be squared,\u201d said H.A. Hellyer, a senior associate fellow at the Royal United Services Institute, a defense and security think tank in London.",
      "He wondered whether an international stabilization force could really dismantle Hamas, a target Israel was unable to achieve through two years of a \u201cbrutal\u201d military operation. While Trump\u2019s peace plan stipulates that Hamas will disarm, the group has reasserted control of Gaza during the first phase of the ceasefire and shown no immediate signs of disarmament.",
      "Disarming Hamas through military intervention is \u201cnot exactly something that any other power is going to be interested in,\u201d he told NBC News.",
      "And when it comes to Gaza\u2019s governance, Hellyer added, \u201cTrump can create his board of peace,\u201d referring to the group that would sit atop Gaza\u2019s governing structure under Trump\u2019s plan, but \u201cyou can\u2019t simply enforce this stuff on the ground without cooperation from the population, unless you just want to turn it into a new type of occupation.\u201d",
      "Turkey\u2019s Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan said Saturday that negotiations over the Gaza stabilization force remain ongoing, including its mandate and rules of engagement, and that its main objective should be to separate Israelis and Palestinians along the border.",
      "\u201cThousands of details, questions are in place,\u201d Fidan said. \u201cI think once we deploy ISF, the rest will come.\u201d",
      "But Fawaz Gerges, a professor of international relations at the London School of Economics, echoed Hellyer\u2019s concerns, noting that so far, \u201cno state has agreed to support its forces into Gaza and potentially and ultimately get into confrontation with Hamas.\u201d",
      "Gerges also feared that \u201cwe will never see the actual implementation of what Phase 2 is supposed to be,\u201d adding it was \u201can illusion\u201d to call what\u2019s happening in Gaza a ceasefire, \u201cbecause the Palestinians, particularly civilians, continue to be killed on a daily basis.\u201d",
      "\u201cEven though the humanitarian situation of the Palestinians has improved a bit, it\u2019s still catastrophic,\u201d he said."

      "WASHINGTON \u2014 The U.S. Navy on Thursday released the results of its investigation into four incidents involving the USS Harry S. Truman carrier strike group during its deployment to the Middle East in late 2024 through earlier this year.",
      "The incidents, which occurred between December 2024 and May 2025, involved the loss of three F/A-18 Super Hornet fighter jets in the Red Sea and a collision between the carrier and a merchant vessel near Port Said, Egypt.",
      "The investigation found that a trip wire failure, poor computer signaling, \u201csubstandard maintenance practices\u201d and \u201coverall low-level knowledge\u201c among some of the carrier group\u2019s personnel contributed to the incidents, according to the report on the investigation. In December 2024, an accidental \u201cfriendly fire\u201d incident involving two F/A-18s, where one was downed and the other was nearly missed, appeared to have occurred in part because of faulty combat systems, the report said.",
      "In April 2024, a fighter jet and a tow tractor were lost because of a maneuver the carrier made to try to avoid incoming fire from Iranian-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen, the report said.",
      "As a result of the findings, the Navy is reviewing some systems and operations and will conduct more personnel training to try to prevent such incidents, according to the recommendations made in the investigation findings.",
      "\u201cThe Navy is committed to being a learning organization,\u201d the vice chief of naval operations, Adm. Jim Kilby, said in a written statement provided by the Navy.",
      "The Navy has said there were no personnel casualties or major injuries related to the incidents.",
      "The Navy\u2019s report said its investigation found that a December 2024 \u201cfriendly fire\u201d incident involving the shooting down of an F/A-18F Super Hornet by the USS Gettysburg, a guided-missile cruiser, was caused by a \u201clack of integrated training opportunities between USS Gettysburg and the Carrier Strike Group, lack of forceful backup on the cruiser, and lack of cohesion across the Carrier Strike Group.\u201d",
      "That lack of cohesion \u201ccontributed to the misidentification, and subsequent engagement, of the friendly aircraft and near miss of another,\u201d the report said.",
      "\u201cThe investigation for the F-18 loss in December 2024 was determined that a lack of reintegrated training opportunities between the USS Gettysburg and the Carrier Strike Group contributed to the misidentification and subsequent engagement of the US Navy aircraft,\u201d Kilby said. \u201cThis was manifested through not following procedures, lack of forceful backup on the cruiser and lack of cohesion across Strike Group units.\u201d",
      "Before the incident, the Truman had spent \u201cseveral hours\u201d defending against Houthi-launched anti-ship cruise missiles and one-way attack drones, the report said.",
      "The investigation also found that the USS Truman\u2019s February 2025 collision with a merchant vessel was \u201cavoidable,\u201d according to the report. The team aboard the Truman failed to safely navigate past the vessel.",
      "In addition, an April 2025 incident involving the loss of an F/A-18E Super Hornet and tow tractor was due to evasive maneuvers that the Truman took while responding to an incoming ballistic missile in the Red Sea, the report said. The investigation determined the aircraft brake system failed, in addition to \u201cinsufficient communication between the bridge, flight deck control, and hangar bay control.\u201d",
      "The investigation also found that a May 2025 incident involving another F/A-18 was caused by a failure of the trip wire aboard the USS Truman. Among the reasons, according to the report, were \u201csubstandard maintenance practices, substandard arresting gear, leadership and overall low-level knowledge\u201d among the personnel operating the trip wire."

      "The 28-year-old migrant worker had arrived in the Chinese territory from the Philippines only a day earlier to work for a family living in a high-rise housing estate. When a massive fire ignited in the middle of the afternoon, tearing across seven of the estate\u2019s eight buildings, Alcaraz shielded the baby in her arms and was rescued by firefighters just in time, along with her employer\u2019s elderly mother.",
      "Hong Kong, an international financial hub of 7.5 million people, is home to hundreds of thousands of domestic helpers like Alcaraz, mostly women from low-income Asian countries such as the Philippines and Indonesia.",
      "The bravery of Alcaraz and other domestic helpers during the Nov. 27 blaze at Wang Fuk Court in the northern district of Tai Po, which killed at least 159 people, has put a spotlight on the critical role they play in the city, where they work for low wages and often live in cramped homes alongside employers who heavily rely on them for housework and caregiving.",
      "At least 10 domestic helpers were killed in the fire, including nine from Indonesia and one from the Philippines.",
      "\u201cWe are truly grateful for their selflessness and also their heroic acts during the fire,\u201d Chris Sun, Hong Kong\u2019s secretary for labor and welfare, told reporters Tuesday.",
      "He added that families of the domestic helpers who died will receive about 800,000 Hong Kong dollars ($100,000) in condolence and compensation payments.",
      "The Tai Po fire, the deadliest in Hong Kong in almost 80 years, has shocked and angered the public amid accusations of corrupt business practices and failures in government oversight. Authorities say the rapid spread of the five-alarm fire was caused by the use of highly flammable materials around the buildings during renovations.",
      "Hong Kong\u2019s top leader, John Lee, said this week that a judge-led independent committee would be set up to \u201creview\u201d the fire, which displaced thousands of people from their homes. Almost two dozen people have been arrested on suspicion of manslaughter and fraud in separate investigations.",

      "While authorities and aid agencies announced several support measures for affected residents, including transitional housing and a donor-supported reconstruction fund that has raised about 2.8 billion Hong Kong dollars ($360 million), the fire creates additional uncertainty for domestic helpers, who live in Hong Kong on dedicated visas and are entitled to far fewer rights than a typical resident.",
      "A helper\u2019s salary starts at about $650 a month.",
      "Even with an additional food allowance of about $160, they still earn below the minimum wage in Hong Kong, which at about $5.40 an hour amounts to $860 a month for a 40-hour workweek. They are also ineligible for permanent residency, which in most cases can be obtained by living in the city for seven years.",
      "Many domestic helpers are mothers themselves, sending most of their earnings to their children back home to support their education.",
      "\u201cThey have deep trauma now. Whenever they pass by the building, they always cry. Some had friends who died in that building,\u201d said Sring Sringatin, a domestic helper in Hong Kong who is chair of the Indonesian Migrant Workers Union.",
      "Sringatin said helpers from Wang Fuk Court were still residing with their employers, either in temporary shelters or alternative housing. Previously, they would often share a room with the family\u2019s children. Now that their employers are homeless, accommodating helpers has become even more difficult, according to Sringatin and other aid workers who have met with affected helpers.",
      "It is also unclear whether employers whose homes have been destroyed will be able to pay their salaries on time, even as the workers \u2014 who are so embedded with families that they often act as the primary caregivers to children and elderly relatives \u2014 continue providing care.",
      "\u201cThey just follow the families if there is care to be given,\u201d said Johannie Tong, a community relations officer for the nonprofit group Mission for Migrant Workers.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s like a default for them. The disaster has happened, but they are still working. They don\u2019t have this question, whether I should work,\u201d said Tong, who visited some of the displaced workers over the past week in government-run temporary shelters that journalists could not access.",
      "Before the fire, workers got little time to themselves. In most cases they worked six days a week, meeting fellow workers on Sundays at parks and other public places to sing karaoke, do each other\u2019s nails or enjoy picnics. Now they are not only traumatized, but they may also be facing more pressure at work and feeling isolated at a time when they are far away from their families, Tong and Sringatin said.",
      "\u201cThey are trying their best to perform their duties, but at the same time they need to be strong, because as a domestic worker there is this feeling that they don\u2019t have anyone in here,\u201d Sringatin said.",
      "Tong said her charity was trying to determine what kind of long-term help workers might need, including immigration assistance or support for their families back home. In the short term, she said, there are ample donations at their center in Hong Kong\u2019s Jordan neighborhood, where workers on Monday were sorting through clothes, toiletries, medicines and more.",

      "LONDON \u2014 Europe faces \u201ccrunch time\u201d on the war in Ukraine, a former European president told NBC News, as the continent battles internal division, Russian threats and open hostility from the United States.",
      "Leaders on the continent are feeling \u201cgenuine fear and distrust regarding the United States,\u201d Toomas Hendrik Ilves, who led Estonia for a decade until 2016, told NBC News in an interview Thursday. But he also warned that Europe\u2019s internal division \u201cultimately shows the weakness\u201d of the bloc, and he feared what might happen \u201cunless we start getting our act together.\u201d",
      "His comments came hours before European powers held urgent negotiations Friday on how to keep Ukraine\u2019s war effort alive and before President Donald Trump published his National Security Strategy that spelled out in black and white Washington\u2019s dissatisfaction toward many of its partners across the pond.",
      "Trump had already left Europe out of this week\u2019s negotiations between his envoy Steve Witkoff, son-in-law Jared Kushner and Russian President Vladimir Putin. Finding itself sidelined, the European Union is trying to formulate its own proposal: using frozen Russian assets to fund Ukraine\u2019s war effort. Even that, however, is facing opposition from Belgium, fearing Russian retaliation.",
      "Putin on Thursday reiterated his goal to take eastern Ukraine \u201cby force\u201d unless his unwavering demands are met. He spoke after his predecessor, the hawkish Dmitry Medvedev, said using Russian money to aid Ukraine would be tantamount to a \u201ccasus belli\u201d \u2014 or an act justifying war \u2014 a common Kremlin refrain of his during the 45-month conflict.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s crunch time, I think, for Ukraine and for Europe,\u201d said Ilves, who served two stints as foreign minister before taking Estonia\u2019s top job.",
      "For Europe, this is about more than just Ukraine; they worry any peace that favors Putin will embolden him to attack and meddle elsewhere on the continent, which has seen an uptick in drone incursions and cyberattacks over the past year.",
      "His war machine is making slow progress on the battlefield but suffering heavy casualties. Kyiv, meanwhile, is running low on money and resources, while suffering a manpower shortage and facing allegations of governmental corruption."

    "story": [
      "The European Commission said Friday it was fining Elon Musk\u2019s social media app X with the equivalent of $140 million, saying that it had breached the bloc\u2019s digital rulebook \u2014 a move that will likely draw the ire of the American government.",
      "The European Commission found that X violated the Digital Services Act, a sweeping 2022 law that requires internet companies to aggressively combat hate speech and misinformation.",
      "The law \u2014 one of the most far-reaching attempts to fight problematic material online \u2014 mandates that companies set up policies and procedures to remove posts deemed illegal by countries within the 27-country union.",
      "The penalty drew swift condemnation from Vice President JD Vance even before the European Commission announced it.",
      "\u201cRumors swirling that the E.U. commission will fine X hundreds of millions of dollars for not engaging in censorship. The EU should be supporting free speech not attacking American companies over garbage,\u201d Vance said in a post on X on Thursday afternoon.",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio said in a post on X that the fine \u201cisn\u2019t just an attack on @X, it\u2019s an attack on all American tech platforms and the American people by foreign governments. The days of censoring Americans online are over.\u201d",
      "Musk did not immediately respond to NBC News' request for comment, but several hours before the European Commission released details on the fine, he shared an X post from Preston Byrne, which advocated for the passage of a U.S. bill that would allow companies and individuals to sue foreign entities in American court over claims of foreign censorship.",
      "Called the GRANITE Act and written by Byrne, an attorney and head of compliance at a cryptocurrency company, it has been filed or is being considered in several state legislatures but does not appear to have been introduced formally at the federal level.",
      "The European Commission, the E.U.\u2019s executive branch, has said its laws do not target any nationality and that it is defending its digital and democratic standards.",
      "After the fine was issued, Henna Virkkunen, the European Commission\u2019s tech chief, said it was proportionate and calculated based on the nature of the infringements, their gravity in terms of affected E.U. users and their duration.",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s very important to underline that DSA is having nothing to do with censorship,\u201d Virkkunen told reporters, according to The Associated Press. Forthcoming decisions on companies which have been charged with DSA violations are expected to take a shorter time than the two years for the X case, she added.",
      "But Brendan Carr, the chair of the Federal Communications Commission criticized the decision in a post on X. \u201cOnce again, Europe is fining a successful U.S. tech company for being a successful U.S. tech company,\u201d he wrote. \u201cEurope is taxing Americans to subsidize a continent held back by Europe's own suffocating regulations.\u201d",
      "The proposed penalty nearly two years in the making came after regulators said in late 2023 that they had opened proceedings into X over suspected failure to combat content disinformation and manipulation. X was the first company to face such an investigation when the probe started.",
      "At the start, regulators said the proceedings were about several issues including the alleged dissemination of illegal content \u201cin the context of Hamas\u2019 terrorist attacks against Israel\u201d and a suspicion that X had a \u201cdeceptive design\u201d in how it handed out blue verification checks to paying users.",
      "Musk, the wealthiest person in the world by some measures, has had rocky relations with European leaders even aside from the investigation into X. In January, the leaders of four European countries, including France and Germany, denounced his influence and warned that Musk should not involve himself in their nations\u2019 domestic politics.",
      "Musk, a former close ally of President Donald Trump, has helped to fuel a wave of far-right candidates across Europe and the globe, although many of his candidates have fallen short of winning power.",
      "X could appeal the commission\u2019s findings in European courts.",
      "In April, after rumors spread that the commission was on the verge of issuing a penalty against X, the company said it was prepared to fight.",
      "\u201cIf the reports that the European Commission is considering enforcement actions against X are accurate, it represents an unprecedented act of political censorship and an attack on free speech,\u201d the company said in a post on X.",
      "\u201cX has gone above and beyond to comply with the EU\u2019s Digital Services Act, and we will use every option at our disposal to defend our business, keep our users safe, and protect freedom of speech in Europe,\u201d the company said."

      "\u201cNo medical intervention was required and the pendant passed naturally,\u201d police said in a statement.",

      "The man accused of swallowing the pendant underwent a medical assessment following his arrest and was monitored by police around the clock in the hope that it would emerge on its own.",
      "\u201cAn officer is assigned to constantly monitor the man,\u201d Auckland Central Area Commander Inspector Grae Anderson said Wednesday before the pendant had been recovered.",
      "\u201cGiven this man is in Police custody, we have a duty of care to continue monitoring him given the circumstances of what has occurred,\u201d he said."

      "Usually known more for pop anthems and extravagant costumes than for political disagreements, the Eurovision Song Contest is facing a major boycott after a push to eject Israel from the contest was rejected.",
      "National broadcasters from Spain, Ireland, Slovenia and the Netherlands all said they would not take part in the 2026 contest, citing Israel\u2019s continued participation in the contest amid the war in Gaza.",
      "In public statements on Thursday, Dutch broadcaster AVROTROS cited the \u201chumanitarian suffering in Gaza\u201d and alleged \u201cpolitical interference\u201d in the contest, while Ireland\u2019s RT\u00c9 said its continued participation was \u201cunconscionable given the appalling loss of lives in Gaza and the humanitarian crisis there.\u201d",
      "Alfonso Morales, secretary-general of Spanish broadcaster RTVE, said \u201cthe situation in Gaza, despite the ceasefire and the approval of the peace process, and Israel\u2019s use of the contest for political purposes, make it increasingly difficult to maintain Eurovision as a neutral cultural event.\u201d",
      "RTV Slovenia reaffirmed it \u201cwill not take part in the competition\u201d if Israel does so, adding: \u201cWe remain guided by the values of peace, respect, and equality among nations.\u201d",
      "A push to ban Israel from the contest came to a head at a meeting of broadcasters on Thursday, but no vote was ultimately held on doing so. Austria, the host of next year\u2019s contest, supported Israel\u2019s continued participation.",
      "Israeli broadcaster KAN said in a statement to NBC News that it had engaged in discussions \u201cto prevent Israel\u2019s disqualification from the competition,\u201d with support from Israel\u2019s President Isaac Herzog.",

      "Germany, one of the contest\u2019s biggest funders, had threatened to withdraw if Israel was excluded. Its participating broadcaster SWR expressed \"deep regret\" at the boycott but said a vote on excluding Israel was \u201cnot required\u201d as it welcomed other changes to the contest\u2019s rules.

      "The annual song contest, which marks its 70th anniversary next year, is entered by artists representing countries across Europe and beyond.",
      "Israel has competed since 1973 and is eligible to take part because its broadcaster KAN is a member of the European Broadcasting Union (EBU).",
      "But Israeli participation has come under pressure since the war in Gaza began two years ago, with an apparent surge in public support for Israel\u2019s entries as well as protests and calls for a boycott.",
      "Israel\u2019s 2025 entrant, Yuval Raphael, placed first in the public televote during the contest in May, but was ranked significantly lower by the expert juries of music industry professionals who allocate half of the points on offer at the contest.",

      "The EBU\u2019s own independent news service, citing Google advertising transparency data, reported in May that advertisements from the Israeli government ran across Europe encouraging supporters to \u201cvote up to 20 times\u201d for Raphael.",

      "Martin Green, director of the Eurovision Song Contest, said the contest would also \u201cstrengthen enforcement of our existing rules to prevent any misuse of the Contest for example through song lyrics or staging.\u201d",
      "In its statement, KAN denied it was \u201cinvolved in any prohibited campaign intended to influence the results of the latest contest.\u201d",
      "The EBU said in a statement that a \u201clarge majority of Members\u201d had agreed with its proposed changes Thursday after \u201ca wide-ranging discussion where Members expressed a variety of views on participation in the Eurovision Song Contest.\u201d",
      "Broadcasters \u201cwill now be asked to confirm their participation,\u201d it said amid speculation that more countries could withdraw, with a final list of participants expected before Christmas.",

      "Rutte later told journalists that President Donald Trump\u2019s efforts were central to ending the war.",
      "\u201cThere is only one person in the whole world who was able to break the deadlock ... and that is the American president,\u201d he told reporters.",

      "\"What comes out of that meeting? I can\u2019t tell you, because it does take two to tango,\" Trump said.",
      "He added: \"Their impression was that they\u2019d like to, he would like to see the war ended. I think he\u2019d like to get back to dealing a more normal life. I think I\u2019d like to be trading with the United States of America, frankly, instead of losing thousands of soldiers a week. But their impression was very strongly that he\u2019d like to make a deal.\"",
      "Following the meeting with Putin in Moscow, Witkoff and Kushner invited Rustem Umerov, secretary of Ukraine\u2019s National Security and Defense Council, to a meeting in Miami on Thursday, a senior U.S. official told NBC News on Wednesday.",
      "Umerov accepted, the official said, and negotiations for a potential peace deal will continue in Florida on Thursday.",

      "Rubio's absence from the summit was \"unusual,\" said William Alberque, NATO's former arms control director. The last time he could remember such an absence was when Colin Powell was absent in 2003, which was attributed to the start of the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq.",
      "Asked why Rubio would not meet with NATO allies, especially during the ongoing Ukraine war negotiations, a senior State Department official told NBC News that he \"has already attended dozens of meetings with NATO allies, and it would be completely impractical to expect him at every meeting.\"",
      "Despite having been sidelined in discussions between Moscow and Washington, European leaders could still have \"a direct impact on the talks\" and \"continue to guide the process,\" Alberque said.",

Russia has no intention of going to war with European countries, he told reporters, but if Europe starts a war, there can be no doubt about Russia\u2019s readiness to respond \u201cright now.\u201d",
      "Stefan Wolff, a professor of international security at England\u2019s University of Birmingham, said Putin's rhetoric was part of the Russian narrative that Europe is undermining Trump\u2019s efforts to end the war and that if it weren't for European obstruction, a deal would long ago have been done.",
      "\"That is probably true, but it's a good thing, because any such deal would be bad for Ukraine, bad for Europe and ultimately bad for the U.S.,\u201d he said.",

Spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Wednesday that the talks were the first such \u201cdirect exchange of opinions,\u201d adding that Putin did not reject the U.S. plan.",

      "MOSCOW \u2014 Russian President Vladimir Putin met with President Donald Trump\u2019s special envoy tasked with negotiating an end to Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine, as well as his son-in-law, for a \"constructive\" five-hour meeting Tuesday, but more work needs to be done, Yuri Ushakov, a foreign policy adviser to Putin, said in a video the Kremlin posted online.",
      "Nearly four years after Putin\u2019s full-scale invasion of his smaller neighbor, Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner are grappling with an empowered Russia, with Ukraine on the back foot both on and off the battlefield. Kyiv\u2019s troops, facing a dire manpower crisis, cling to strategic hubs, and a major corruption scandal has shaken President Volodymyr Zelenskyy\u2019s government and forced the resignation of his top negotiator.",
      "Kyiv and its allies view Witkoff, the man whom Washington has sent to negotiate with Putin this week, with suspicion after a leaked phone call suggested he was advising Moscow on how to deal with Trump, according to a transcript published by Bloomberg News.",
      "Ushakov said in the Kremlin video that the meeting Tuesday was \u201cvery useful, constructive\u201d but that the sides agreed not to get into details about the negotiations. \u201cWe specifically discussed territorial issues, without which we see no resolution to the crisis,\u201d he said.",
      "Witkoff presented the Russians with several documents. \u201cThere was a document containing 27 points. We naturally reviewed it. However, we didn\u2019t work on the wording, and there were no discussions with our American colleagues about it,\u201d Ushakov said, noting that the Americans gave the Russians four additional documents.",
      "He added: \u201cA compromise hasn\u2019t been found yet, but some American proposals seem more or less acceptable, but they need to be discussed. Some of the language we\u2019ve been offered is acceptable. The work will continue. It is indeed one of the most important questions.\u201d",
      "Ushakov said that contacts would continue \u201cat the level of representatives, aides and other representatives, in particular with these two people who arrived in the Kremlin today,\u201d but that no meeting between Trump and Putin was scheduled.",
      "Asked by a journalist whether an end to the conflict was now closer than before, Ushakov replied: \u201cNo further, that\u2019s for sure. But there\u2019s still a lot of work to be done, both in Washington and Moscow. This has been agreed upon, and contacts will continue.\u201d",
      "Putin\u2019s special envoy, Kirill Dmitriev, posted a single word on X after the meeting: \u201cProductive.\u201d",
      "In an interview with Fox News host Sean Hannity that aired  Tuesday, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said it was necessary to push both sides to reach a deal.",
      "\u201cThis has now become a war of attrition, and sadly, the Russians have shown their willingness to sacrifice 7,000 soldiers a week in an effort to achieve this,\u201d Rubio said.",
      "He added: \u201cOnly Putin can end this war on the Russian side. \u2026 We have tried to bring both sides together and see what proposals we could come up with that both sides could live with. We\u2019re going to do everything we can to make it work.\u201d",
      "A leaked 28-point plan the U.S. proposed last month was widely deemed as capitulating to Russia.",
      "\u201cThe Kremlin simply doesn\u2019t want a deal that\u2019s anything short of what it wants,\u201d such as a watered-down security guarantee for Ukraine and territorial concessions by Kyiv, said Michael A. Horowitz, an independent geopolitical and security analyst who has followed the war closely.",
      "From Ukraine\u2019s perspective, acceding to most of Russia\u2019s demands would set it up for a third invasion, \u201cafter 2014 and 2022,\u201d Horowitz added, referring to Russia\u2019s military backing of separatists in Ukraine\u2019s east in 2014 and the full-scale invasion eight years later.",
      "The 'three pillars'",
      "Putin has never hidden his hard-line demands.",
      "He has sought the capture of all of Ukraine\u2019s eastern industrial region of Donbas, comprising the contested Donetsk region and Russian-controlled Luhansk. (Russia holds about one-fifth of Ukraine\u2019s territory.) He has also called for Ukraine to be \u201cdemilitarized,\u201d essentially rendering it defenseless, and a final peace settlement to be acknowledged in international law.",
      "\u201cThere are three pillars on which we will not compromise,\u201d a Russian official briefed on the matter said on condition of anonymity. \u201cOne is the territory of the Donbas. The second is a limit on Ukraine\u2019s armed forces. The third is the recognition of territory by America and Europe.\u201d",
      "Moscow is prepared to be flexible on certain secondary issues, the official said this week, like hundreds of billions in Russian assets frozen in Europe at the beginning of the war. Ukraine and its European allies have called for the funds to be used to boost Ukraine\u2019s shattered economy.",
      "Trump\u2019s peace plan envisions that roughly one-third of the frozen assets, or $100 billion, would be invested in the U.S.-led efforts to rebuild Ukraine. According to the original leaked 28-point plan, the U.S. would receive 50% of the profits from the venture. No specific details have been released about the plan that was whittled down to 20 points during Sunday\u2019s talks between U.S. and Ukrainian officials in Florida.",
      "Abbas Gallyamov, a Russian political analyst and former Putin speechwriter, told NBC News he thinks Putin could be willing to compromise.",
      "\u201cThe most important thing you need to understand is he can\u2019t afford to fall out with Trump. It would be quite suicidal,\u201d Gallyamov said. And while the war has not devastated the Russian economy, in the long term Putin understands that ramped-up sanctions by Trump would make economic recovery very difficult, if not impossible, he said.",
      "\u201cIf Trump will really press him, Putin will agree to end the fighting \u2014 maybe with the calculation that he will build up strength, quickly organize some sort of provocation in the spring to blame on the Ukrainians and hit again,\u201d Gallyamov said.",
      "A lot depends on what the Americans demand, Gallyamov said, adding that Putin may be willing to agree to a ceasefire over Christmas and New Year\u2019s.",
      "But Putin is unlikely to truly end the war without intense pressure from the U.S., he said.",
      "What could Putin accept?",
      "Witkoff and Kushner arrived in Moscow fresh from talks with Ukraine in Florida this weekend, which both Washington and Kyiv deemed productive, without sharing details.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the last chance for Russia to convince Witkoff, and Witkoff must convince Trump that the Russian view is the correct one,\u201d said Andrei Fedorov, Russia\u2019s former deputy foreign minister.",
      "Putin has signaled for months, even before the diplomatic flurry caused by Trump\u2019s 28-point proposal, that he was willing to continue fighting.",
      "In September, he said he welcomed \u201ca certain light at the end of the tunnel\u201d in the wake of Trump\u2019s peace efforts in Alaska. \u201cWe\u2019ll see how the situation develops,\u201d he said at the time. \u201cIf not, we\u2019ll have to resolve all the challenges we face militarily.\u201d",
      "He reiterated that last week, saying fighting would stop when Ukrainian troops withdraw from the territories they hold. \u201cIf they don\u2019t withdraw, we will achieve this by force,\u201d he said.",
      "The leaked 28-point plan would force Ukraine to cede territory, including land it holds in the Donetsk region. It would limit the Ukrainian army to 600,000, down from more than 800,000 currently. It would also bar Ukraine from ever joining the NATO defense alliance \u2014 which Kyiv has said is a nonstarter.",
      "But according to Tatiana Stanovaya, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center, a Berlin-based think tank, even the leaked plan did not go far enough for Putin.",
      "The 600,000-personnel limit the plan would impose on the Ukrainian army is one sticking point, she wrote in an analysis last week. It would still leave Kyiv with the largest army in Europe.",
      "The draft plan also did not include a total ban on long-range weapons in Ukraine, she added.",
      "The wording is also important for Putin, Stanovaya said. Putin indicated last week that he would want every word of any peace agreement to be carefully weighed, having mocked the language of the original proposal as undiplomatic and, at times, \u201cridiculous.\u201d",
      "If he could write his own version of the peace plan, Horowitz said, Putin would legally claim all four Ukrainian provinces he illegally annexed in 2022, not just Donetsk and Luhansk; reduce Ukraine\u2019s army to one-tenth of its current size; complete the so-called denazification of Ukraine, which is code for a Russian say in Ukraine\u2019s future and removal of nationalist parties; and lift all sanctions.",
      "While Putin does not necessarily think those demands would be achievable, Horowitz said, he thinks the final deal should be closer to his ideal peace than that of Ukraine's \u2014 and he is prepared to wait if that\u2019s not the case.",
      "\u201cThe problem, of course, is that this \u2018ideal deal\u2019 means Russia will be encouraged to invade Ukraine again \u2014 beyond what it already occupies,\u201d he added.",
      "Keir Simmons and Natasha Lebedeva reported from Moscow, and Yuliya Talmazan from London."

I don\u2019t want them in our country. Their country is no good for a reason,\" said Trump, who has a history of disparaging African people and migrant communities.",

In a social media post Monday night, Noem said, \u201cI am recommending a full travel ban on every damn country that\u2019s been flooding our nation with killers, leeches, and entitlement junkies.\u201d A source familiar with the plan said today that about 30 countries will be on that list.",

      "\u201cWith Somalia, which is barely a country, you know, they have no, they have no anything. They just run around killing each other. There\u2019s no structure,\u201d he said before turning to Omar, a progressive Democrat and Somali American he\u2019s mocked and targeted for years.",
      "\u201cI always watch her,\u201d Trump said, saying she \u201chates everybody. And I think she\u2019s an incompetent person. She\u2019s a real terrible person.\u201d",
      "Omar's family fled the civil war in Somalia and lived in a Kenyan refugee camp before she moved to the U.S. and became a citizen.",

      "He has also repeatedly attacked Somalia and Somali migrants in recent months. Last week he said, without citing evidence, that hundreds of thousands were \u201ccompletely taking over the once great state of Minnesota\u201d and forming violent gangs. There are about 80,000 Somalis in Minnesota.",
      "Melvin Carter, the mayor of St. Paul, called Trump\u2019s comments racist, Islamophobic and xenophobic in a statement Tuesday.",

It would have forced Kyiv to cede its territories to Moscow, including the land that it currently controls. It would have limited the size of Kyiv\u2019s army and barred Ukraine from ever joining NATO.",
      "The proposal blindsided Kyiv, which launched a storm of negotiations in Europe and the U.S. to try to amend the plan and make it more palatable to Ukraine.",
      "It comes as Zelenskyy\u2019s government is on the back foot on the battlefield, while rocked by a major corruption scandal. His powerful chief of staff and top negotiator, Andriy Yermak, resigned last week after being implicated in the probe.",
      "Shortly before his scheduled meeting with the American delegation, Putin addressed an investment forum where he said his army held the advantage in Ukraine, while criticizing European leaders for hindering the peace process.",
      "Russia has no intention of going to war with European countries, but if Europe starts a war, Russia is ready \u201cright now,\u201d Putin told reporters. \"If Europe suddenly wants to start a war with us and does, then we could quickly get a situation in which we have no one to negotiate with.\u201d",

      "WASHINGTON \u2014 The White House confirmed Monday that the U.S. did launch a second strike on an alleged drug boat from Venezuela in early September and that it was ordered by Adm. Frank M. Bradley, who at the time headed the Joint Special Operations Command.",
      "The follow-up strike killed the survivors of an initial U.S. strike on the vessel, which the Trump administration has said originated from Venezuela. Some lawmakers and legal experts say that second attack could constitute a war crime.",
      "\u201cWith respect to the strikes in question on Sept. 2, Secretary Hegseth authorized Adm. Bradley to conduct these kinetic strikes,\u201d White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement during Monday's briefing.",
      "\u201cAdm. Bradley worked well within his authority and the law directing the engagement to ensure the boat was destroyed and the threat to the United States of America was eliminated,\" she added.",
      "U.S. Special Operations Command, which Bradley now leads as commander, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",

      "One U.S. official and a source familiar with the Pentagon\u2019s actions on Sept. 2 told NBC News recently that the first of the two strikes conducted that day left at least two survivors, with the subsequent strike killing them.",
      "Hegseth, in a social media post Monday night, also indicated that Bradley ordered the second strike. \"Let\u2019s make one thing crystal clear: Admiral Mitch Bradley is an American hero, a true professional, and has my 100% support. I stand by him and the combat decisions he has made \u2014 on the September 2 mission and all others since.\"",
      "On Sunday, President Donald Trump told reporters that Hegseth didn't order the second strike.",
      "\"He said he didn't do it,\" said Trump, who also said he didn't know if the second strike even happened.

I\u2019m going to find out about it, but Pete said he did not order the death of those two men.\"",
      "Asked Monday what law the U.S. military relied on to justify the second strike, Leavitt said: \u201cThe strike conducted on Sept. 2 was conducted in self-defense to protect Americans in vital United States interests. The strike was conducted in international waters and in accordance with the law of armed conflict.\u201d",

      "Similarly, the leaders of the House Armed Services Committee \u2014 chairman Mike Rogers, R-Ala., and ranking member Adam Smith, D-Wash. \u2014 said they were taking \"seriously the reports of follow-on strikes on boats alleged to be ferrying narcotics in the SOUTHCOM region and are taking bipartisan action to gather a full accounting of the operation in question.\"",
      "Smith told reporters Monday night that he would be receiving a classified briefing this week from Bradley about the strikes. He added that it would be \"helpful\" to have Hegseth testify.",
      "The details of the briefing with Bradley are still being worked out, Smith said, but he indicated that they are aiming for it to take place Thursday.",
      "Bradley is expected to be in Washington this week to speak with senior lawmakers about the strikes, according to two people familiar with the matter.",
