      "Frederick Forsyth, the author of \u201cThe Day of the Jackal\u201d and other bestselling thrillers, has died after a brief illness",
      "LONDON -- Frederick Forsyth, the British author of \u201cThe Day of the Jackal\" and other bestselling thrillers, has died after a brief illness, his literary agent said Monday. He was 86.",
      "Jonathan Lloyd, his agent, said Forsyth died at home early Monday surrounded by his family.",
      "\u201cWe mourn the passing of one of the world\u2019s greatest thriller writers,\" Lloyd said.",
      "Forsyth served as a Royal Air Force pilot before becoming a foreign correspondent and a novelist. In 2015, he told the BBC that he had also worked for the British intelligence agency MI6 for many years, starting from when he covered a civil war in Nigeria in the 1960s.",
      "\u201cThe Day of the Jackal,\u201d published in 1971, propelled him into global fame. The political thriller about a professional assassin was made into a film in 1973 and more recently a television series starring Eddie Redmayne and Lashana Lynch.",
      "He wrote more than 25 books including \u201cThe Afghan,\u201d \u201cThe Kill List,\u201d \u201cThe Dogs of War\" and \u201cThe Fist of God\" that have sold over 75 million copies, Lloyd said.",
      "His publisher, Bill Scott-Kerr, said that \u201cRevenge of Odessa,\u201d a sequel to the 1974 book \u201cThe Odessa File\" that Forsyth worked on with fellow thriller author Tony Kent, will be published in August.",

    "story": [
      "Trailblazing ballerina Misty Copeland has decided to move on to what she calls \u201cthe next stage\u201d in her career",
      "NEW YORK -- Ten years ago this month, Misty Copeland sat in front of a hastily arranged news conference at American Ballet Theatre, fighting back tears of pride over her new role: principal dancer.",
      "\u201cThis is it,\u201d she said, with emotion. \u201cThis has been my dream since I was 13.\u201d",
      "The occasion was highly unusual \u2014 normally, when a dancer is promoted, a brief press release is issued. But this was Copeland, a crossover star with fame far beyond the insular world of ballet. And now she was becoming the first Black female principal in the company\u2019s 75-year history \u2014 just days after her New York debut as the lead in \u201cSwan Lake\u201d brought a refreshingly diverse, packed audience to the Metropolitan Opera House.",
      "Now, a decade and many accomplishments later, Copeland is retiring from the company she joined as a teenager.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s been 25 years at ABT, and I think it\u2019s time,\u201d Copeland, 42, told the Associated Press last week ahead of Monday\u2019s official announcement of her move. \u201cIt\u2019s time for me to move to the next stage.\u201d",
      "The company is planning a splashy farewell on Oct. 22, featuring performances by Copeland \u2014 for the first time in five years \u2014 and other dancers. There will be speeches and film clips. And Copeland, who's been heavily involved in the planning, will get a chance to venture one more time onto that balcony in Verona; she\u2019ll dance again in the beautiful \u201cRomeo and Juliet\u201d pas de deux. Honorary chairs for the evening will be Caroline Kennedy and Oprah Winfrey.",
      "A lot has happened in a quarter-century. Copeland, whose success brought new energy to an art form that has always been overwhelmingly white, has authored a number of books, including a memoir and and several works for young people. The second installment of \u201cBunheads\u201d arrives in September, and more are already planned in a series she calls \u201ca reflection of my journey, showing the range of cultures and types of people that can be a part of the ballet world.\u201d",
      "Copeland has also made a short film with her production company. And her philanthropic organization, The Misty Copeland Foundation, works on increasing diversity in the dance world and giving more kids who grew up economically disadvantaged, like she did, the chance to dance.",
      "\u201cIt was so important for children growing up and seeing somebody like Misty and saying, \u2018Oh my gosh, she looks like I do,\u2019\u201d says Susan Jaffe, ABT\u2019s artistic director, who is overseeing the farewell performance. \u201cThrough her books, through her lectures, even her endorsements, she has really been a trailblazer.\"",
      "Still, progress moves slowly. When Copeland exits ABT, there will no longer be a Black female principal dancer at the company \u2014 nor at many ballet companies around the globe. Copeland discussed that continued challenge in the dance world, among other topics, in the AP interview last week. Remarks have been edited for clarity and brevity.",
      "COPELAND: You know, I\u2019ve become the person that I am today, and have all the opportunities I have today, because of ballet, (and) because of American Ballet Theatre. I feel like this is me saying thank you to the company. So it\u2019s a farewell. (But) it won\u2019t be the end of me dancing. \u2026 Never say never.",
      "COPELAND: I\u2019ve noticed that the conversation is not something we shy away from anymore in terms of the lack of equity, the lack of diversity in this (dance) world. That\u2019s one of the biggest shifts I\u2019ve seen \u2026 a lot of young people that just can imagine being part of it in some way. They can imagine stepping into Lincoln Center and being at the Metropolitan Opera House.",
      "COPELAND: It's definitely concerning, and I think I\u2019ve just gotten to a place in my career where there\u2019s only so much I can do on a stage. There\u2019s only so much that visual representation like that can do. I feel like it\u2019s the perfect timing for me to be stepping into a new role, and hopefully still shaping and shifting the ballet world and culture.",
      "COPELAND: I think about my partnership with (former ABT principal) Roberto Bolle and him giving me so many opportunities to travel the world with him \u2026 (Former ABT principal) Marcelo Gomes, he\u2019s been such a such a big part of my journey, and of course Herman Cornejo. We\u2019ve had a beautiful partnership throughout my career and I\u2019m excited to dance with him again (at the October farewell,)",
      "COPELAND: It\u2019s made me even more patient. I just have a lighter and brighter outlook on life because it\u2019s just such an incredible thing to experience and witness... I think ballet has prepared me for being a mother in so many ways. I think it\u2019s ... prepared me for life and being resilient and patient and sensitive and empathetic and strong, and all of these things.",
      "COPELAND: He doesn\u2019t understand at all! (laughs) He\u2019s seen very little of me dancing. \u2026 But he\u2019s very drawn to it. He is a mover. He\u2019s very athletic. He is so drawn to music. He started violin on Monday. We live in the museums. He really is drawn to art. I think he\u2019s definitely on the artist\u2019s track.",
      "COPELAND: It\u2019s been pretty evenly split between all of then. I think it just depends on what\u2019s at the forefront and what needs my focus. ... But it\u2019s exciting to be able to utilize dance in so many different mediums, and to me, that\u2019s how you get true diversity \u2014 by giving people different entry points into learning about dance and feeling like they can be a part of it, which has been my goal. How do I bring dance to as many people as possible in a way that really works for them?",
      "COPELAND: It\u2019s a difficult time. And I think all we can really do is keep our heads down and keep doing the work. \u2026 we\u2019re fortunate in that way that we\u2019ve built great relationships and can continue to do the work right now through my foundation. There\u2019s no way to stop the people that feel passionate about this work. We will continue doing it. It is so necessary for the well-being of our societies and communities. I think there are times to speak out and yell from the rooftops. And for me, I feel like this is a time to keep my head down and really stay focused and do the work.",

      "Cole Escola of \u201cOh, Mary!\u201d",
      "NEW YORK -- Even the ushers at Radio City Music Hall seemed thrilled to be in the room where it happened.",
      "A few of them could be seen grooving, like everyone else at Sunday\u2019s Tony Awards, to the \u201cHamilton\u201d reunion performance \u2014 a medley of some of that blockbuster musical\u2019s biggest songs, performed by the original cast. The occasion was the 10th Broadway anniversary of Lin-Manuel Miranda\u2019s juggernaut that spawned multiple touring companies, a West End production and a live-capture film \u2014 and is still going strong.",
      "But while the theater was buzzing to songs like \u201cMy Shot,\u201d \u201cThe Schuyler Sisters,\u201d \u201cHistory Has Its Eyes on You\u201d and \u201cThe Room Where It Happens,\u201d some people were unfortunately NOT in the room where, er, it was happening. They were the ones who\u2019d taken a trip to the bar or a stroll around the lobby, and were then held from entering until the next commercial break \u2014 missing perhaps the night\u2019s most anticipated highlight.",
      "They also missed the entire audience singing along with Jonathan Groff, aka King George, \u201cDa-da-da, dat-da, dat, da-da-da, da-ya-da, Da-da, dat, dat, da-ya-da.\u201d Note for next year: Exit at your own peril!",
      "Some other notable moments from Tony night:",
      "Most award winners thank Mom, their agents, their co-stars and their spouses.",
      "Cole Escola, one of the major stars of this Tony night, promised Mom a call, but also decided to thank \u201cTeebo from Grindr\u201d \u2014 the dating app \u2014 when accepting the award for lead actor in a play.",
      "Escola is star and writer of the riotous \u201cOh, Mary!\u201d \u2014 a reimagining of the life of Mary Todd Lincoln (and her beleaguered husband, Abe) that addresses the question: What if the Lincoln assassination wasn\u2019t such a bad thing for Mary? (Mary wants to be a cabaret star, you see.) The show is seeing audiences collapse in laughter for 80 minutes every night on Broadway.",
      "Escola, a downtown cabaret star, beat out high-wattage competitors like George Clooney and Daniel Dae Kim for the acting award. They mentioned their co-nominees in their speech, saying they had enjoyed sharing \u201cwarm salads\u201d at pre-awards lunches.",
      "Escola is the first nonbinary actor to win a Tony in the category.",
      "When \u201cMaybe Happy Ending\u201d writers Hue Park and Will Aronson accepted the award for best book of a musical, the first handed out, Park felt it necessary to point out that they weren\u2019t an actual couple. \u201cI am very much single,\u201d he clarified, for anyone wondering.",
      "Then later, when the duo won for best score, Park deemed a reminder necessary: \u201cBy the way, I\u2019m still single.\u201d",
      "And then at the end of the night, \u201cMaybe Happy Ending,\u201d the charming and quirky romance between decommissioned robots in a futuristic Korea, won the big prize: best musical. Park did not get the mic. But producer Jeffrey Richards did, and he reminded the crowd: \u201cHue is still single.\u201d",
      "Cynthia Erivo, the \u201cWicked\u201d star and powerhouse vocalist hosting the evening, said it first: \u201cAs they apparently say in a very fertile piece of intellectual property,\" she said with a wink, \u201cthere\u2019s no place like home. And Broadway has always been mine.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s a familiar theme on Tony night: the theater community as a welcoming haven for those who may feel different or unseen. It was echoed by Harvey Fierstein, winner of a lifetime achievement award, describing how he joined the theater after being welcomed by a company in Brooklyn. And it was expressed very emotionally by Nicole Scherzinger, winning best actress in a musical for \u201cSunset Blvd.\u201d",
      "\u201cGrowing up, I always felt like I didn\u2019t belong,\u201d said Scherzinger, former lead singer of the pop group Pussycat Dolls who plays Norma Desmond in the minimalist version of the Andrew Lloyd Webber show. \u201cBut you all have made me feel like I belong, and I have come home at last.\u201d Those last words echo the lyrics of one of Desmond\u2019s big numbers, \u201cAs If We Never Said Goodbye.\u201d",
      "\u201cSo if there\u2019s anyone out there who feels like they don\u2019t belong, or your time hasn\u2019t come, don\u2019t give up,\u201d Scherzinger continued. \u201cJust keep on giving and giving because the world needs your love and your light now more than ever.\u201d",
      "There\u2019s always lots of chatter going on during an awards show. But the way the crowd quieted down during Audra McDonald\u2019s powerful, agonized performance of \u201cRose\u2019s Turn\u201d from \u201cGypsy\u201d was striking. In the song's quiet moments, you heard utter silence in the vast room.",
      "McDonald, the Tonys' most awarded actor, is clearly revered by the theater community, who cheered her with standing ovations. But the award she was up for went to Scherzinger.",
      "It\u2019s been two years since HBO\u2019s \u201cSuccession\u201d ended, but its stars keep turning up at awards shows \u2014 and often winning. Jeremy Strong won a Tony last year and was nominated for an Oscar this year. Kieran Culkin won an Oscar this year and is appearing on Broadway this season, though he wasn\u2019t nominated. And now it was the turn of Sarah Snook \u2014 Emmy and Golden Globe winner \u2014 to win a Tony.",
      "Snook, who played mercurial sibling Shiv Roy in the series, took the Tony for best actress in a play for \u201cThe Picture of Dorian Gray,\u201d in which she plays all 26 roles.",
      "Tony winner and musical theater regular Gavin Creel, who died last year of cancer, was a friend to many in the theater community, and was remembered more than once on Tony evening.",
      "During the early pre-show, actor Celia Keenan-Bolger was honored with the Isabelle Stevenson award, for her advocacy work in the arts. She spoke movingly of her deep friendship with Creel and their advocacy work together.",
      "Later, singer and actor Sara Bareilles performed a soulful duet of \u201cTomorrow\u201d from \u201cAnnie,\u201d harmonizing with Erivo, during the memorial segment. That segment ended with a photo of Creel, also a dear friend to Bareilles, who teared up.",
      "Both Bareilles and Keenan-Bolger are involved with the Gavin Creel Fellowship, an initiative that plans to provide $25,000 grants to five emerging theater actors each year.",
      "The final award had been announced by presenter Miranda \u2014 best musical to \u201cMaybe Happy Ending\u201d \u2014 and the audience started to disperse. But Erivo had another idea.",
      "Riffing on the concept of leaving, she launched into the famous \u201cDreamgirls\u201d ballad \u201cAnd I Am Telling You I\u2019m Not Going\u201d \u2014 with rewritten lyrics.",
      "It was a yet another powerhouse performance from someone who has one of the best voices on the planet. The audience stopped dispersing \u2014 and started cheering.",

      "Most big collections have only a fraction of their items on display, with the rest locked away in storage",
      "LONDON -- A museum is like an iceberg. Most of it is out of sight.",
      "Most big collections have only a fraction of their items on display, with the rest locked away in storage. But not at the new V&A East Storehouse, where London\u2019s Victoria and Albert Museum has opened up its storerooms for visitors to view \u2014 and in many cases touch \u2014 the items within.",
      "The 16,000-square-meter (170,000-square-foot) building, bigger than 30 basketball courts, holds more than 250,000 objects, 350,000 books and 1,000 archives. Wandering its huge, three-story collections hall feels like a trip to IKEA, but with treasures at every turn.",
      "The V&A is Britain\u2019s national museum of design, performance and applied arts, and the storehouse holds aisle after aisle of open shelves lined with everything from ancient Egyptian shoes to Roman pottery, ancient Indian sculptures, Japanese armor, Modernist furniture, a Piaggio scooter and a brightly painted garbage can from the Glastonbury Festival.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s 5,000 years of creativity,\u201d said Kate Parsons, the museum\u2019s director of collection care and access. It took more than a year, and 379 truckloads, to move the objects from the museum\u2019s former storage facility in west London to the new site.",
      "In the museum\u2019s biggest innovation, anyone can book a one-on-one appointment with any object, from a Vivienne Westwood mohair sweater to a tiny Japanese netsuke figurine. Most of the items can even be handled, with exceptions for hazardous materials, such as Victorian wallpaper that contains arsenic.",
      "The Order an Object service offers \u201ca behind-the-scenes, very personal, close interaction\u201d with the collection, Parsons said as she showed off one of the most requested items so far: a 1954 pink silk taffeta Balenciaga evening gown. Nearby in one of the study rooms were a Bob Mackie-designed military tunic worn by Elton John on his 1981 world tour and two silk kimonos laid out ready for a visit.",
      "Parsons said there has been \u201ca phenomenal response\u201d from the public since the building opened at the end of May. Visitors have ranged from people seeking inspiration for their weddings to art students and \u201csomeone last week who was using equipment to measure the thread count of an 1850 dress.\u201d She says strangers who have come to view different objects often strike up conversations.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s just wonderful,\u201d Parsons said. \u201cYou never quite know. \u2026 We have this entirely new concept and of course we hope and we believe and we do audience research and we think that people are going to come. But until they actually did, and came through the doors, we didn\u2019t know.\u201d",
      "The V&A\u2019s flagship museum in London\u2019s affluent South Kensington district, founded in the 1850s, is one of Britain\u2019s biggest tourist attractions. The Storehouse is across town in the Olympic Park, a post-industrial swath of east London that hosted the 2012 summer games.",
      "As part of post-Olympic regeneration, the area is now home to a new cultural quarter that includes arts and fashion colleges, a dance theater and another V&A branch, due to open next year. The Storehouse has hired dozens of young people recruited from the surrounding area, which includes some of London\u2019s most deprived districts.",
      "Designed by Diller, Scofidio and Renfro, the firm behind New York\u2019s High Line park, the building has space to show off objects too big to have been displayed very often before, including a 17th-century Mughal colonnade from India, a 1930s modernist office designed by Frank Lloyd Wright and a Pablo Picasso-designed stage curtain for a 1924 ballet, some 10 meters (more than 30 feet) high.",
      "Also on a monumental scale are large chunks of vanished buildings, including a gilded 15th-century ceiling from the Torrijos Palace in Spain and a slab of the concrete fa\u00e7ade of Robin Hood Gardens, a demolished London housing estate.",
      "Not a hushed temple of art, this is a working facility. Conversation is encouraged and forklifts beep in the background. Workers are finishing the David Bowie Center, a home for the late London-born musician\u2019s archive of costumes, musical instruments, letters, lyrics and photos that is due to open at the Storehouse in September.",
      "One aim of the Storehouse is to expose the museum\u2019s inner workings, through displays delving into all aspects of the conservators\u2019 job \u2013 from the eternal battle against insects to the numbering system for museum contents \u2014 and a viewing gallery to watch staff at work.",
      "The increased openness comes as museums in the U.K. are under increasing scrutiny over the origins of their collections. They face pressure to return objects acquired in sometimes contested circumstances during the days of the British Empire",
      "Senior curator Georgia Haseldine said the V&A is adopting a policy of transparency, \u201cso that we can talk very openly about where things have come from, how they ended up in the V&A\u2019s collection, and also make sure that researchers, as well as local people and people visiting from all around the world, have free and equitable access to these objects.",
      "\u201cOn average, museums have one to five percent of their collections on show,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat we\u2019re doing here is saying, \u2018No, this whole collection belongs to all of us. This is a national collection and you should have access to it.\u2019 That is our fundamental principle.\u201d",

      "Filmmaker Dean DeBlois returns to the world of \u201cHow to Train Your Dragon\u201d for a new live-action adaptation, in theaters Friday",
      "Ever wanted to soar through the skies on the back of a friendly dragon? The new \u201cHow to Train Your Dragon\u201d may be the ticket, from a decidedly safer, though possibly still vertigo-inducing, distance.",
      "This live-action adaption of the underdog adventure story sends the audience cascading through the clouds with the teenage Viking boy Hiccup and his dragon friend Toothless. It\u2019s the kind of immersive sensation and giddy wish fulfillment that might just have you forgetting momentarily to breathe and, maybe more importantly, that you\u2019re still in a movie theater. Credit to veteran cinematographer Bill Pope, no stranger to fantasy worlds, whether it\u2019s \u201cThe Matrix\u201d or \u201cScott Pilgrim vs. The World.\u201d",
      "\u201cHow to Train Your Dragon\u201d doesn\u2019t stray far from the original, from shots to story beats. Gerard Butler once again plays Berk\u2019s Chief Stoick the Vast. The new Hiccup, actor Mason Thames, even sounds a bit like Jay Baruchel. But unlike so many live-action remakes of animated films, it also doesn\u2019t feel superfluous, or, worse, like a poor imitation of its predecessor that trades the magic of animation for photorealism.",
      "Perhaps that\u2019s because filmmaker Dean DeBlois, who made the three animated films, stayed in the director\u2019s chair. Who better to kill their darlings than the one who brought them to the screen in the first place? And, crucially, to know where live-action might actually enhance the fabric of the world created by author Cressida Cowell.",
      "It helps that dragon technology has come a long way since, say, \u201cDragonHeart.\u201d These fire-breathing CG creatures feel disarmingly real. And though it might look like \u201cLord of the Rings\u201d or \u201cGame of Thrones,\u201d the tone stays light enough for younger filmgoers. There are a few intense sequences, but none that takes it any further than the animated film did 15 years ago.",
      "\u201cHow to Train Your Dragon\u201d does start a little slow, however, which is odd because it also begins with a fiery battle between the Vikings and the dragons on the Isle of Berk. There\u2019s a lot of exposition and introduction that needs to happen before you can just give yourself over to the story. In this more multicultural version, the warriors on Berk have been recruited from tribes around the globe to try to defeat the dragons.",
      "Hiccup is a Viking nepo baby. As the chief's son, he sits in a place of privilege, but he\u2019s also a general outcast in this world of ruthless warriors \u2014 skinny and weak, he just longs to be part of the action, not sharpening the weapons. Killing dragons is currency in this society, and his crush Astrid (Nico Parker) happens to be one of the most promising up-and-comers. His sole champion is Gobber (a delightful Nick Frost), the blacksmith and dragon slayer teacher, who convinces the chief to give the clever Hiccup a shot.",
      "The film finds its internal engine when Hiccup finds Toothless, the wide-eyed \u201cNight Fury\u201d dragon whom he can\u2019t bring himself to kill. Instead, he decides to study this discovery, who he finds is not as nearly fearsome as everyone assumes. \u201cHow to Train Your Dragon\u201d teaches empathy and ingenuity without a sermon.",
      "Thames, a teenager himself, is the perfect embodiment of adolescent awkwardness and boldness. You can have all the cute dragons you want, but the audience would be lost if the human conduit to the relationship isn\u2019t up to the task. Butler seems to be having a good time, resplendent in fur and chest-thumping ideas about ancient duties. And Parker gives Astrid a relatable depth \u2014 the best in the bunch who is outshone in an unequal fight.",
      "Kids deserve movies that are made on the biggest possible canvas. \u201cHow to Train Your Dragon\u201d is one that's worth the trip to the theater. It might just spark some young imaginations, whether it\u2019s to go back and read the books or dream up their own worlds. And, chances are, no one is going to be yelling \u201cchicken jockey.\u201d",
      "\u201cHow to Train Your Dragon,\u201d a Universal Pictures release in theaters Friday, is rated PG by the Motion Picture Association for \u201csequences of intense action and peril.\u201d Running time: 125 minutes. Three and a half stars out of four.",

      "In the box office showdown between a deadly assassin and a chaotic CG alien, \u201cLilo & Stitch\u201d still had the edge. The Disney juggernaut celebrated a third weekend at the top of the charts, while the John Wick spinoff \u201cBallerina\u201d did not jet\u00e9 as high as expected.",
      "According to studio estimates Sunday, \u201cFrom the World of John Wick: Ballerina\u201d earned $25 million from 3,409 theaters in the U.S. and Canada. Several weeks ago it was tracking to open in the $35 to $40 million range, but that was adjusted down several times. Ultimately, it still came in lower than forecasts. The movie, directed by Len Wiseman, makes a sideline character out of Keanu Reeves\u2019 John Wick and focuses on Ana de Armas. It takes place during the events of \u201cJohn Wick 3.\u201d",
      "The box office performance is a bit perplexing result considering that \u201cBallerina\u201d got good critic reviews and audience exit polls. Conventional wisdom would say that word of mouth might have given it a boost over the weekend. But, recently, opening weekend isn\u2019t the end all that it used to be. \u201cBallerina\u201d could be in the game for the long haul.",
      "The Lionsgate release, a Thunder Road Films and 87Eleven Entertainment production, had a hefty production price tag reported to be in the $90 million range. But much of that cost has already been offset by foreign pre-sales. Internationally, it earned $26 million from 82 countries, bringing its global opening to $51 million.",
      "As the first spinoff, it\u2019s the second lowest opening of the five-film franchise \u2013 above only the first film which opened just over $14 million in 2014, which does not account for inflation. The franchise overall has grossed more than $1 billion worldwide.",
      "First place once again went to \u201cLilo & Stitch,\u201d which added another $32.5 million in North America, bringing its domestic total to $335.8 and global tally to $772.6 million. In just 17 days, it's already made more domestically than the live-action \u201cThe Little Mermaid\u201d did in its entire run ($298 million).",
      "\u201cMission: Impossible \u2014 The Final Reckoning\u201d slid to third place with $15 million, bringing its worldwide total to $450.4 million. \u201cKarate Kid: Legends\u201d earned $8.7 million to take fourth place. And \u201cFinal Destination: Bloodlines\" rounded out the top five with $6.5 million.",
      "The new Wes Anderson movie \u201cThe Phoenician Scheme\u201d expanded beyond New York and Los Angeles to 1,678 theaters nationwide. The Focus Features release starring Benicio del Toro made an estimated $6.3 million and landed in sixth place.",

      "Audra McDonald, the most recognized performer in the theater awards\u2019 history, could possibly extend her Tony lead.

      "Edmund White, a pioneer of contemporary gay literature, died this week at age 85",
      "NEW YORK -- Andrew Sean Greer, a Pulitzer Prize-winning novelist, remembers the first time he read Edmund White. It was the summer of 1989, he was beginning his second year at Brown University and he had just come out.",
      "Having learned that White would be teaching at Brown, he found a copy of White's celebrated coming-of-age novel, \u201cA Boy's Own Story.\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019d never read anything like it \u2014 nobody had \u2014 and what strikes me looking back is the lack of shame or self-hatred or misery that imbued so many other gay male works of fiction of that time,\u201d says Greer, whose \u201cLess\u201d won the Pulitzer for fiction in 2018. \"I, of course, did not know then I was reading a truly important literary work. All I knew is I wanted to read more.",
      "\u201cReading was all we had in those days \u2014 the private, unshared experience that could help you explore your private life,\" he said. \"Ed invented so many of us.\"",
      "White, a pioneer of contemporary gay literature, died this week at age 85. He left behind such widely read works as \u201cA Boy\u2019s Own Story\u201d and \u201cThe Beautiful Room Is Empty\u201d and a gift to countless younger writers: Validation of their lives, the discovery of themselves through the stories of others.",
      "Greer and other authors speak of White's work as more than just an influence, but as a rite of passage: \"How a queer man might begin to question all of the deeply held, deeply religious, deeply American assumptions about desire, love, and sex \u2014 who is entitled to have it, how it must be had, what it looks like,\u201d says Robert Jones Jr., whose novel above love between two enslaved men, \u201c The Prophets,\u201d was a National Book Award finalist in 2021.",
      "Jones remembers being a teenager in the 1980s when he read \u201dA Boy's Own Story.\" He found the book at a store in a gay neighborhood in Manhattan's Greenwich Village, \u201cthe safest place for a person to be openly queer in New York City,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cIt was a scary time for me because all the news stories about queer men revolved around AIDS and dying, and how the disease was the Christian god\u2019s vengeance against the 'sin of homosexuality,'\u201d Jones added.",
      "\u201cIt was the first time that I had come across any literature that confirmed that queer men have a childhood; that my own desires were not, in fact, some aberration, but were natural; and that any suffering and loneliness I was experiencing wasn\u2019t divine retribution, but was the intention of a human-made bigotry that could be, if I had the courage and the community, confronted and perhaps defeated,\" he said.",
      "Starting in the 1970s, White published more than 25 books, including novels, memoirs, plays, biographies and \u201cThe Joy of Gay Sex,\u201d a response to the 1970s bestseller \u201cThe Joy of Sex.\" He held the rare stature for a living author of having a prize named for him, the Edmund White Award for Debut Fiction, as presented by the Publishing Triangle.",
      "\u201cWhite was very supportive of young writers, encouraging them to explore and expand new and individual visions,\u201d said Carol Rosenfeld, chair of the Triangle. The award was \u201cone way of honoring that support.\u201d",
      "Winners such the prize was founded, in 2006, have included \u201cThe Prophets,\u201d Myriam Gurba 's \u201cDahlia Season\u201d and Joe Okonkwo's \u201cJazz Moon.\u201d Earlier this year, the award was given to Jiaming Tang's \u201c Cinema Love,\u201d a story of gay men in rural China.",
      "Tang remembered reading \u201cA Boy's Own Story\u201d in his early 20s, and said that both the book and White were \u201cessential touchpoints in my gay coming-of-age.\u201d",
      "\u201cHe writes with intimate specificity and humor, and no other writer has captured the electric excitement and crushing loneliness that gay men experience as they come of age,\u201d Tang said. \"He\u2019s a towering figure. There\u2019d be no gay literature in America without Edmund White.\u201d",

      "Pablo Cruz, who plays Chespirito in the series, told The Associated Press in an interview translated from Spanish that the show is a tribute that tells \u201ca story that we know will connect with a very broad audience and give them an opportunity to further appreciate what they already admire and love.\u201d",
      "Chespirito's two most famous characters were \u201cEl Chavo del Ocho\u201d (\"The Boy from Number Eight\u201d) and \u201cEl Chapulin Colorado\u201d (\u201cThe Crimson Grasshopper\u201d). \u201cEl Chavo del Ocho\" was an 8-year-old boy orphan living alone in a Mexican neighborhood with his barrel, freckles, striped shirt and grayed cap. \u201cEl Chapulin Colorado\u201d was a naive superhero dressed in a red bodysuit and hood with antennae that helped him detect danger miles away (despite the name, his yellow shorts and boots gave him more the look of a red bumblebee).",
      "Through his characters, Chespirito favored a clean comedy style far removed from the sexual innuendo and obscenity-laced jokes popular today. His morning shows were a staple for preschoolers, much like \u201cCaptain Kangaroo\u201d was in the United States.",
      "The HBO series \u201cis a tribute to Chespirito\u2019s importance as one of the key figures in Mexican television and highlights the enormous impact his television programs had throughout Latin America,\u201d Fernando C\u00e1rdenas, digital manager for the Hispanic Organization of Latin Actors, said in a statement to the AP.",
      "The miniseries is a powerful act of cultural preservation, one that documents the impact Latinos have had on the global entertainment industry, said Sehila Mota Casper, director of Latinos in Heritage Conservation.",
      "\u201cFor so many of us, his characters weren\u2019t just entertainment,\u201d Mota Casper said. \u201cThey shaped how we understand humor, how we face challenges and how we see ourselves as Latinxs. This series honors that impact. By telling his story in this way, we help make sure the cultural histories that shaped us are seen, respected and carried forwards to future generations.\u201d",
      "\u201cEl Chavo\u201d proved so popular that reruns are still shown in multiple countries in Latin America and on Spanish-language television in the United States. Many Latin Americans, living under dictatorships during the height of the show, found his underdog triumphs heroic in the face of authority. In a 2005 interview with the Mexican newspaper La Jornada, G\u00f3mez Bola\u00f1os said he always wrote with working-class people in mind.",
      "\u201cDuring the 1970s, the program was produced to reflect the reality of working-class families in Mexico and enjoyed enormous impact in other Spanish-speaking countries because the situations portrayed in the stories were similar to those of all audiences, regardless of geographical boundaries,\u201d C\u00e1rdenas said.",
      "Alberto Lammers, who grew up watching \u201cEl Chavo\u201d in Peru during the 1970s and \u201880s, was excited for the series and the childhood nostalgia it evokes. He was also excited to learn more about what was happening behind the scenes in G\u00f3mez Bola\u00f1os\u2019 life.",
      "\u201cIt really struck a chord with my childhood,\u201d Lammers, who now lives in California, said after finishing the first episode. \u201cIt gives heart and context to his complexity and the characters he built. It\u2019s also a very interesting look at how he became a TV personality. I\u2019m looking forward to seeing where it goes! It\u2019s a real-life telenovela!\u201d",
      "Fans also took to social media to praise the episode and their awe at the uncanny similarities between the actors and the people they are playing.",
      "For Lammers, after migrating to the U.S., \u201cEl Chavo del Ocho\u201d served as a connection to his roots even if the show wasn't based in Peru.",
      "\u201cGoing to that show to me was actually very comforting,\u201d Lammers said. \u201cIt built a sense of community across most of Latin America.\u201d",

      "A judge has denied Harvey Weinstein\u2019s request for a mistrial after a juror complained of issues in the deliberations",
      "NEW YORK -- A juror in Harvey Weinstein\u2019s sex crimes trial asked to be removed from the case Friday because he felt his fellow jurors were treating a member of their panel in an \u201cunfair and unjust\u201d way, but the judge told him he had to keep deliberating.",
      "Judge Curtis Farber later denied a defense request for a mistrial, saying he believed the juror was simply expressing discomfort in the deliberation process, noting that he\u2019s the youngest on the 12-person panel.",

      "The second day of deliberations ended Friday without a verdict. Jurors are expected back in court Monday.",
      "Jurors reheard testimony from Weinstein\u2019s three accusers. They also reviewed other evidence, including medical records and emails.",
      "Twice on Friday, though, a juror requested to address the court without the other jurors present.",
      "The juror said he wanted to be excused from the trial because he was uncomfortable with how some jurors were acting toward another juror.",
      "But Farber denied the request, saying there were no more alternate jurors to replace him and, in any case, his concerns did not warrant being dismissed.",
      "The juror insisted, calling the treatment \u201cunfair and unjust\u201d even as he described the tension as \u201cplayground stuff\u201d with jurors shunning another juror and talking behind their back.",
      "Weinstein\u2019s lawyer Arthur Aidala argued that the jury should be told to stop deliberating while the court found out more about the concerns.",
      "He criticized the judge\u2019s questions to the concerned juror as \u201canemic at best.\u201d",
      "\u201cYou didn\u2019t ask him one follow-up question,\u201d Aidala said.",

      "The blockbuster horror film \u201cSinners\u201d features the Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians in a short, but impactful scene",
      "CHOCTAW, Miss. -- It\u2019s a small part in a big movie, but for the Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians, their scene in \"Sinners\" is a huge deal.",
      "The horror movie blockbuster, starring Michael B. Jordan as a gangster turned vampire slayer, paints a brief but impactful portrait of the tribe using Choctaw actors and cultural experts. For some, it\u2019s the first time they\u2019ve seen the Choctaw way of life accurately portrayed on the big screen.",
      "In the scene, a posse of Choctaw, riding on horseback and in an old truck, arrives at a small farmhouse to warn the couple that lives there of coming danger. When the couple refuses their help, a Choctaw man wishes them luck in his native language before riding off.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve not seen another movie that has our language, like, spoken correctly,\u201d said Cynthia Massey, a cultural consultant for \u201cSinners.\u201d",
      "Massey runs the tribe\u2019s Chahta Immi Cultural Center alongside Sherrill Nickey and department director Jay Wesley. All three were hired as cultural consultants to ensure a genuine depiction of the tribe in the film. Together, they sifted through archives, researching how their ancestors would have dressed, spoken and acted in the 1930s, when \u201cSinners\u201d takes place.",
      "\u201cI was honored and humbled by the fact that they wanted a true representation,\u201d said Wesley, who also acted in the movie.",
      "Wesley connected the filmmakers to Choctaw actors and artifacts like the beaded sashes the Choctaw characters wear in the movie. Those sashes are now part of a \u201cSinners\u201d display at the cultural center.",
      "The movie's introduction also features a short snippet of a Choctaw war chant, performed by Wesley\u2019s daughter, Jaeden Wesley, who is a student at the University of California, Los Angeles. While recording, Jaeden Wesley said the filmmakers told her they wanted the Choctaw people to hear their music in the movie.",
      "\u201cWe were catering to our own people, even in that short little second,\u201d Jaeden Wesley said.",
      "Shining a spotlight on often overlooked cultures and topics, like the Choctaw people, is part of the mission at Proximity Media, which produced \u201cSinners.\u201d The company was founded by \u201cSinners\u201d director Ryan Coogler, his wife and film producer, Zinzi Coogler, and producer Sev Ohanian.",
      "\u201cIt was never a question for us that if we were going to portray the Mississippi Choctaw, we got to have the right people who can tell us, who can tell Ryan, what we\u2019re not knowing, what we\u2019re not thinking,\u201d Ohanian said. \u201cIt was all because we\u2019re trying to serve Ryan\u2019s story of like putting truth on screen.\"",
      "Ohanian and his co-founders didn\u2019t stop with Choctaw consultants; they enlisted a small army of experts who advised on the confluence of cultures mingling in the Mississippi Delta, where the film is set. The resulting cinematic world was so well received, community organizers penned an open letter, inviting Coogler and his fellow filmmakers to visit the Delta. Last week, the Cooglers, Ohanian and others took up the offer, attending a \u201cSinners\u201d screening in Clarksdale, Mississippi. Clarksdale is where the film's events unfold.",
      "\u201cI hope this encourages other filmmakers to find opportunities to be authentic in their storytelling and to look at this rich tapestry of culture that\u2019s right here in America,\u201d Ohanian said, noting the film industry has historically misrepresented nonwhite groups.",
      "For Wesley and his fellow consultants, the hope is the film will cultivate curiosity in audiences, encourage them to learn more about Choctaw culture and visit the Chahta Immi Cultural Center.",
      "\u201cIt's important to be connected to this culture because this was here before the public was here,\u201d Massey said. \u201cProbably three-quarters of Mississippi was Choctaw land, and now we only have 350,000 acres.\u201d",
      "They say Choctaw participation in the film has cultivated a sense of pride among tribe members. Nickey hopes it will encourage a sort of cultural renaissance at a time when she says fewer and fewer Choctaw speak their native language.",
      "\u201cI know for a fact that there are a lot of kids out there that don't even know how to speak our language. They only speak English,\u201d Nickey said. \u201cI hope they know it's okay to speak our language.\u201d",

      "NEW YORK -- Years before Ana de Armas was using an ice skate to slice a neck in \u201cFrom the World of John Wick: Ballerina,\u201d she co-starred with Keanu Reeves in a much different film.",
      "The erotic thriller \u201cKnock Knock,\u201d released in 2015, was de Armas\u2019 first Hollywood film. De Armas, born and raised in Cuba, had just come to Los Angeles after acting in Spain. English was new to her, so she had to learn her lines phonetically.",
      "\u201cIt was tough and I felt miserable at times and very lonely,\u201d she says in an interview. \u201cBut I wanted to prove myself. I remember being in meetings with producers and they would be like, \u2018OK, I\u2019ll see you in a year when you learn English.\u2019 Before I left the office, I would say, \u2018I\u2019ll see you in two months.\u2019\u201d",
      "Since \u201cKnock Knock,\u201d her rise to stardom has been one of the last decade's most meteoric. She was radiant even as a hologram in \u201cBlade Runner 2049.\u201d She stole the show in Rian Johnson\u2019s star-studded \u201cKnives Out.\u201d She breezed through the Bond movie \u201cNo Time to Die.\u201d She was Oscar nominated for her Marilyn Monroe in \u201cBlonde. \u201d",
      "And now, 10 years after those scenes with Reeves, de Armas is for the first time headlining a big summer action movie. In \u201cBallerina,\u201d in theaters Friday, de Armas\u2019 progressive development as an unlikely action star reaches a butt-kicking crescendo, inheriting the mantle of one of the most esteemed, high-body-count franchises.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a big moment in my career, and I know that. I can see that,\u201d she says. \u201cIt makes me look back in many ways, just being with Keanu in another film in such a different place in my career. It definitely gives me perspective of the journey and everything since we met. Things have come far since then.\u201d",
      "While de Armas, 37, isn\u2019t new to movie stardom, or the tabloid coverage that comes with it, many of her career highlights have been streaming releases. \u201cThe Gray Man\u201d and \u201cBlonde\u201d were Netflix. \u201cGhosted\u201d was Apple TV+. But \u201cBallerina\u201d will rely on de Armas (and abiding \u201cJohn Wick\u201d fandom) to put moviegoers in seats.",
      "Heading in, analysts expected an opening weekend of around $35-40 million, which would be a solid result for a spinoff that required extensive reshoots. Reviews, particularly for de Armas playing a ballerina-assassin, have been good.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of pressure,\u201d says director Len Wiseman. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot to carry all on her shoulders. But she\u2019ll be the first person to tell you: \u2018Put it on. Let me carry the weight. I\u2019m totally game.\u2019\u201d",
      "De Armas, whose talents include the ability to be present and personable on even the most frenzied red carpets, has done the globe-trotting work to make \u201cBallerina\u201d a big deal: appearing at CinemaCon, gamely eating hot wings and cheerfully deflecting questions about her next film, \u201cDeeper,\u201d with Tom Cruise.",
      "Yet for someone so comfortable in the spotlight, one of the more interesting facts about de Armas is that she lives part time in that bastion of young A-listers: Vermont.",
      "\u201cYeah, it surprised many people,\u201d she says, chuckling. \u201cAs soon as I went up there, I knew that was going to be a place that would bring me happiness and sanity and peace. But I know for a Cuban who doesn\u2019t like cold very much, it\u2019s very strange.\u201d",
      "Winding up in northern New England is just as unexpected as landing an action movie like \u201cBallerina.\u201d She grew up with the conviction, from age 12, that she would be an actor. But she studied theater.",
      "\u201cI never thought I was going to do action,\u201d de Armas says. \u201cWhat was relatable for me was watching Cuban actors on TV and in movies. That was my reality. That\u2019s all I knew, so the actors I looked up to were those.\u201d",
      "De Armas also had bad asthma, which makes some of the things she does in \u201cBallerina\u201d \u2014 a movie with a flamethrower duel \u2014 all the more remarkable to her.",
      "\u201cI couldn\u2019t do anything,\u201d she remembers. \u201cI couldn\u2019t run. I sometimes couldn\u2019t play with my friends. I had to just be home and be still so I wouldn\u2019t get an asthma attack. So I never thought of myself as someone athletic or able to run just a block. So this has been a surprise.\u201d",
      "At 14, she auditioned and got into Havana\u2019s National Theatre of Cuba. Four years later, with Spanish citizenship through her grandparents, she moved to Madrid to pursue acting. When she arrive in LA in 2014, she had to start all over again.",
      "Now as one of the top Latina stars in Hollywood, she's watched as immigrant paths like hers have grow increasingly arduous if not impossible. The day after she spoke to The Associated Press, the Trump administration announced a travel ban on 12 countries and heavy restrictions on citizens of other countries, including Cuba.",
      "\u201cI got here at a time when things were definitely easier in that sense,\u201d says de Armas, who announced her then-imminent U.S. citizenship while hosting \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d in 2023. \u201cSo I just feel very lucky for that. But it\u2019s difficult. Everything that\u2019s going on is very difficult and very sad and really challenging for many people. I definitely wish things were different.\u201d",
      "Chad Stahelski, director of the four \u201cJohn Wick\u201d films and producer of \u201cBallerina,\u201d was about to start production on \u201cJohn Wick: Chapter 4\u201d when producer Basil Iwanyk and Nathan Kahane, president of Lionsgate, called to set up a Zoom about casting de Armas. He quickly watched every scene she had been in.",
      "\u201cHow many people would have played the Bond girl kind of goofy like that?\u201d he says. \u201cI know that I can harden people up. I know I can make them the assassin, but getting the charm and the love and the humor out of someone is trickier. But she had it.\u201d",
      "In \u201cKnives Out,\u201d Stahelski saw someone who could go from scared and uncertain to a look of \u201cI'm going to stab you in the eye.\u201d",
      "\u201cI like that in my action heroes,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t want to see the stoic, superhero vibe where everything\u2019s going to be OK.\u201d",
      "But it wasn\u2019t just her acting or her charisma that convinced Stahelski. It was her life story.",
      "\u201c'John Wick' is all hard work \u2014 and I don\u2019t mean just in the training. You\u2019ve got to love it and put yourself out there,\u201d says Stahelski. \u201cWhen you get her story about how she came from the age of 12, got into acting, what she sacrificed, what she did, that\u2019s what got my attention. \u2018Oh, she\u2019s a perseverer. She doesn\u2019t just enjoy the view, she enjoys the climb.\u2019\u201d",
      "When that quote is read back to her, de Armas laughs, and agrees.",
      "\u201cBeing Cuban, and my upbringing and my family and everything I\u2019ve done, I\u2019ve never had a plan B,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019ve never had that thing of, \u2018Well, if it doesn\u2019t work, my family can help.\u2019 Or, \u2018I can do this other career.\u2019 This was it. And I also knew, besides being the thing I loved the most, this was my survival. This is how I live. This is how I feed myself and my family. So it\u2019s also a sense of, I don\u2019t know, responsibility.\u201d",
      "That makes her reflect back to when she was just trying to make it in Hollywood, sounding out words, trying not to disappoint directors whose instructions she could barely understand, trying not to be intimidated by the action star across from her who had just finished shooting the first \u201cJohn Wick.\u201d",
      "\u201cI was so committed to do it,\u201d she says. \u201cI was so invested in the trying of it, just giving it a shot. When I give something a shot, I try my best, whatever that is. Then I can actually say: I gave it a shot.\u201d",

      "Atlantic City police say surveillance video initially led them to a 57-year-old Pleasantville man. He was later seen on video walking through various parts of the city, trying to sell the instruments, and he eventually sold one while the other remains unaccounted for, police said, declining further comment. The man has been charged with burglary and theft.",
      "The band was set to kick off the An Evening With Heart tour at the Hard Rock Hotel & Casino in Atlantic City on Saturday, and its gear had been set up there the day prior to the show. Among the items stolen were a custom-built, purple sparkle baritone Telecaster guitar with a hand-painted headstock made for band member Nancy Wilson, and a vintage 1966 Gibson EM-50 mandolin that band member Paul Moak has played for over 25 years.",

      "The seven-woman, five-man jury is considering two counts of criminal sex act and one count of rape, each relating to a different accuser and a different date. In this case, the criminal sex act charge is the higher-degree felony. The jury got the case after a juror was replaced by an alternate after she couldn\u2019t come to court due to illness.",
      "Weinstein, 73, has pleaded not guilty.",
      "Nearly eight years ago, a series of sexual misconduct allegations against the Oscar-winning movie producer propelled the #MeToo movement. Some of those accusations later generated criminal charges and convictions in New York and California.",
      "The New York conviction from 2020 was subsequently overturned, leading to the retrial before a new jury and a different judge.",
      "Jurors heard more than five weeks of testimony, including lengthy and sometimes fiery questioning of Weinstein's three accusers in the case.",
      "Jessica Mann said he raped her in 2013, when she was trying to build an acting career. Miriam Haley accused him of forcibly performing oral sex on her in 2006, when she was looking for work in entertainment production.",

      "\u201cThey all had dreams of pursuing careers in the defendant's world, the entertainment industry,\u201d prosecutor Nicole Blumberg told jurors in her closing argument Tuesday. She contended that Weinstein let the women think he was interested in their careers when what actually interested him were their bodies, and \"he was going to have their bodies and touch their bodies whether they wanted him to or not.\u201d",

      "The long-running gang case involving Atlanta rapper Young Thug will end without a single murder conviction",
      "ATLANTA -- Three years after Atlanta rapper Young Thug and 27 others were indicted on gang and racketeering charges, followed by a long, problem-plagued trial, nobody will be convicted of murder.",
      "When Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis announced the indictment in May 2022, she said her office was cracking down on a violent street gang responsible for multiple killings run by Young Thug, whose real name is Jeffery Williams.",
      "But Willis dropped the only remaining murder charge Monday after defendant Demise McMullen pleaded guilty to a lesser charge of aggravated assault. Young Thug went home Oct. 31 after pleading guilty to gang, drug and gun charges and remains on probation.",
      "Prosecutors alleged that Young Thug and two others founded the street gang Young Slime Life, which was associated with the Bloods street gang, in 2012. The 33-year-old artist has a record label called Young Stoner Life, which prosecutors alleged was tied to Young Slime Life.",
      "Prosecutors drew ire for using song lyrics and social media posts in their case. Attorney Doug Weinstein, who represented defendant Deamonte Kendrick, who raps under the name Yak Gotti, said prosecutors targeted men who pursued music as a way out of hardship in economically \u201cdeprived\u201d Atlanta areas and tried to \u201cclaw them back in, hold them back down.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhatever they may have done in their youth, and I would argue most of them didn't do anything, to be targeted in this way by the prosecutors is just wrong,\u201d said Weinstein. \u201cWhatever you think of their music \u2014 the violence, the misogynistic lyrics \u2014 that is not a reason to go after these guys.\u201d",
      "Weinstein continued, adding, \u201cPeople like my client, Mr. Kendrick, had to be incarcerated for 2 1/2 years or more, in the case of some of these defendants, for a crime that they didn\u2019t do.\"",
      "Kendrick was stabbed in jail. He was one of two defendants who didn\u2019t take plea deals, and the only one cleared of all charges, including a murder charge in the 2015 drive-by shooting death of rival gang member Donovan Thomas Jr., known as \u201cBig Nut.\u201d",
      "In a statement to The Associated Press, Willis spokesperson Jeff DiSantis said \u201canti-gang efforts\u201d have yielded \u201cover 400 convictions of gang members\" since Willis became district attorney, including 19 people in this case. Those efforts were \u201ckey\u201d in making Fulton County \"safer, taking dangerous offenders off the streets and sending a message that gang activity will not be tolerated in our community,\u201d he said.",
      "Willis prosecuted the case using Georgia's broad anti-racketeering law. Critics say using that law caused a messy trial by roping in dozens of people with varying levels of alleged culpability. The anti-racketeering law allows prosecutors to present evidence that might otherwise not be allowed, which some defense attorneys say lets prosecutors present irrelevant material to the jury. It also often leads to people being held in jail longer for multiple reasons.",
      "\u201cIt made everything so much more complicated and cumbersome,\u201d said Max Schardt, defense attorney for defendant Shannon Stillwell.",
      "Stillwell was among five codefendants who stood trial alongside Young Thug beginning in November 2023.",
      "After Young Thug and the others entered guilty pleas, Stillwell and Kendrick were the only ones who took their chances with a jury. They were found not guilty of racketeering, murder and gang-related charges in December. Stillwell was found guilty only of gun possession. The verdict came nearly two years after jury selection began.",
      "Nine other defendants, including the rapper Gunna, accepted plea deals before the trial began. Prosecutors dropped charges against one defendant after he was convicted of murder in an unrelated case. Twelve defendants were split from the original trial, and charges against six of them were dismissed in early December. Another recently got a murder charge dismissed after entering an Alford plea, which allows him to maintain his innocence while acknowledging that it is in his best interest to plead guilty.",
      "McMullen, who was also charged with murder in Thomas' killing, entered an Alford plea to a lesser aggravated assault charge and another count of violating the anti-racketeering law. A judge in this case sentenced him to 40 years, with 20 to be served in confinement at the same time as the sentence he's already serving, and 20 suspended for time served. That leaves one remaining defendant who is accused of shooting and wounding an Atlanta police officer in February 2022 while on probation. His fate is expected to be determined soon.",
      "Atlanta defense attorney Andrew Fleischman, who was not involved in the case, said Willis could have secured guilty pleas years ago without a long, expensive trial if she hadn't used the anti-racketeering law.",
      "\u201cShe went for a home run, and she didn\u2019t get it,\u201d said Fleischman.",

      "As if a movie about sharks wasn't scary enough, the filmmakers behind \u201cDangerous Animals\u201d have upped the screams by adding what every thriller needs \u2014 a serial killer.",
      "While that may sound like very dangerous moviemaking, the result is actually taut and well crafted, a worthy birthday present to \u201cJaws,\u201d celebrating its 50th anniversary this summer.",
      "\u201cDangerous Animals\u201d stars Jai Courtney as an Australian boat captain who likes feeding his female customers to sharks and videotaping it, while also offering little brainy speeches about the nature of makos, mosquitos or sailfish while toying with his prey.",
      "He meets what seems like his match in Hassie Harrison's Zephyr, an American antisocial surf queen who lives in a van and refuses to be tied down. \u201cThere was nothing for me on land,\u201d she says. She's kind of a handful for any serial killer, For instance, she can pick locks with the underwire from a bikini top.",
      "Nick Lepard's screenplay is muscular and satisfying, with nods to \u201cJaws,\u201d of course, but also to \u201cPoint Break,\u201d \u201cHannibal\u201d and even the song \u201cBaby Shark.\u201d He says he was inspired to write \u201cDangerous Animals\u201d by seeing a surfboard bag and imagining it carrying a body, which says something about how Lepard's mind works, though we're not judging.",
      "Director Sean Byrnes has a super ability to build dread and his scenes are crisp without being exploitative. The movie was shot on Queensland\u2019s Gold Coast, but may take a bite out of the region's shark cage diving fleets. I'm looking twice even before taking showers now.",
      "Zephyr and the serial killer play an engaging game of chess for most of the movie, if by chess is meant she's fighting to stay alive by wriggling out of handcuffs and running or swimming away and he's determined for her to be shark food.",
      "\u201cOh, you're a fighter. I love fighters. It makes for a better show,\u201d he says, biting into the scenery almost as viciously as the sharks chomp on chum.",
      "He also does that thing that all serial killers do \u2014 saying he and his victim are similar. \u201cYou're hard as nails. Like me. You and me, we're sharks,\u201d he tells her. She tells him to stop talking so much and calls him ocean scum.",
      "The music department has a fun wink with the soundtrack. One scene uses Steve Wright's \u201cEvie (Part One)\u201d \u2014 in which the singer begs his love to let her hair hang down \u2014 as the serial killer makes mementos out of his victims' hair. Another moment, astonishingly, plays Etta James' \u201cAt Last,\u201d the ultimate wedding song, just as the bad guy finally captures his quarry inches from rescue.",
      "The setting of a boat in the middle of the Coral Sea unlocks a delicious new home for terror. Sealable hatches and no one for miles means screaming is no good. And the serial killer has weaponized Vegemite.",
      "One thing Zephyr has up her sleeve is a boy, smitten after a meet-cute in which she tries to shoplift ice cream. He's played by the hunky Josh Heuston and they're perfect for each other but she resists until she's snatched by our nasty boat captain. But even though she blew him off, her boy is suspicious about her disappearance and is on the hunt.",
      "\u201cDangerous Animals,\u201d thankfully, doesn't try to be more than it is, although the quite beautiful images of sharks sliding through the ocean show, naturally, that we are the species that inspired the title. After all, sharks don't see a surfboard bag and wonder if they can put a body in it.",
      "\u201cDangerous Animals,\u201d an IFC Films release in theaters Friday, is rated R for \u201cstrong, bloody violent content, grisly images, sexuality, language and brief drug use.\u201d Running time: 98 minutes. Three stars out of four.",

      "NEW YORK -- Kimberly Belflower knew \u201cJohn Proctor is the Villain\u201d needed its final cathartic scene to work \u2014 and, for that, it needed Lorde's \u201cGreen Light.\u201d",
      "\u201cI literally told my agent, \u2018I would rather the play just not get done if it can\u2019t use that song,\u2019\u201d the playwright laughed. She wrote Lorde a letter, explaining what the song meant, and got her green light.",
      "Starring Sadie Sink, the staggering play about high schoolers studying \u201cThe Crucible\u201d as the #MeToo movement arrives in their small Georgia town, earned seven Tony nominations, including best new play \u2014 the most of any this season. It\u2019s among a group of Broadway shows that have centered the stories of young people and attracted audiences to match.",
      "Sam Gold\u2019s Brooklyn-rave take on \u201cRomeo + Juliet,\u201d nominated for best revival of a play and led by Kit Connor and Rachel Zegler with music from Jack Antonoff, drew the youngest ticket-buying audience recorded on Broadway, producers reported, with 14% of ticket purchasers aged 18-24, compared to the industry average of 3%.",
      "The shows share some DNA: pop music (specifically the stylings of Antonoff, who also produced \u201cGreen Light\u201d), Hollywood stars with established fanbases and stories that reflect the complexity of young adulthood.",
      "\u201cIt was very clear that young people found our show because it was doing what theater\u2019s supposed to do,\u201d Gold said. \u201cBe a mirror.\u201d",
      "The themes \u201cJohn Proctor\u201d investigates aren't danced around (until they literally are). The girls are quick to discuss #MeToo's impact, intersectional feminism and sexual autonomy. Their conversations, true to teenage girlhood, are laced with comedy and pop culture references \u2014 Taylor Swift, Beyonc\u00e9, \u201cTwilight,\u201d and, of course, Lorde.",
      "Fina Strazza, 19, portrays Beth, a leader who is whip-smart and well-intentioned \u2014 but whose friendships and belief system are shaken by the play's revelations.",
      "\u201cYou have so much empathy and are so invested in her, but she still has these mishaps and slip-ups that young people often have,\u201d said Strazza, nominated for best featured actor in a play. Some audience members have given her letters detailing how Beth helped them forgive themselves for how they handled similar experiences.",
      "The script is written in prose, with frequent line breaks and infrequent capital letters. Director Danya Taymor, nominated for best direction of a play a year after winning a Tony for another teenage canon classic, \u201cThe Outsiders, \u201d was drawn to that rhythm \u2014 and how Belflower's depiction of adolescence captured its intensity, just as S.E. Hinton had.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s something about the teenage years that is so raw,\u201d Taymor said. \u201cNone of us can escape it.\u201d",
      "During his Tony-winning production of \u201cAn Enemy of the People,\u201d Gold found himself having conversations with young actors and theatergoers about climate change, politics and how \u201ctheater was something that people their age and younger really need in a different way, as the world is becoming so addicted to technology,\u201d he said.",
      "That conjured \u201cRomeo and Juliet.\u201d The original text \u201chas it all in terms of what it means to inherit the future that people older than you have created,\u201d Gold said.",
      "Building the world of this show, with an ensemble under 30, was not unlike building \u201cAn Enemy of the People,\u201d set in 19th century Norway, Gold said: \u201cI think the difference is that the world that I made for this show is something that a very hungry audience had not gotten to see.\u201d",
      "Fans, Gold correctly predicted, were ravenous. Demand ahead of the first preview prompted a preemptive extension. Word (and bootleg video) of Connor doing a pullup to kiss Zegler made the rounds. \u201cMan of the House,\u201d an Antonoff-produced ballad sung by Zegler mid-show, was released as a single. With the show premiering just before the U.S. presidential election, Voters of Tomorrow even registered new voters in the lobby.",
      "Audiences proved willing to pay: Average ticket prices hovered around $150. Cheaper rush and lottery tickets drew lines hours before the box office opened. Every week but one sold out.",
      "\u201cThe show was initially really well sold because we had a cast that appealed to a really specific audience,\u201d said producer Greg Nobile of Seaview Productions. \u201cWe continued to see the houses sell out because these audiences came, and they were all over online talking about the ways in which they actually felt seen.\u201d",
      "Thomas Laub, 28, and Alyah Chanelle Scott, 27, started Runyonland Productions for that very reason.",
      "\u201cWe both felt a lot of frustration with the industry, and the ways that we were boxed out of it as students in Michigan who were able to come to New York sparingly,\u201d Laub said. Runyonland was launched in 2018 with the premise that highlighting new, bold voices would bring change.",
      "This spring, Scott, known for playing Whitney in HBO\u2019s \u201cSex Lives of College Girls,\u201d acted off-Broadway in Natalie Margolin's \u201cAll Nighter.\u201d",
      "\u201cI was standing onstage and looking out and seeing the college kids that I was playing,\u201d Scott said. \u201cI was like, \u2018I respect you so much. I want to do you proud. I want to show you a story that represents you in a way that doesn\u2019t belittle or demean you, but uplifts you.\u2019\u201d",
      "Co-producing \u201cJohn Proctor,\u201d Scott said, gave Runyonland the opportunity to target that audience on a Broadway scale. Belflower developed the show with students as part of a The Farm College Collaboration Project. It's been licensed over 100 times for high school and college productions. The Broadway production's social and influencer marketing is run by 20-somethings, too.",
      "Previews attracted fans with a $29 ticket lottery. While average prices jumped to over $100 last week (still below the Broadway-wide average), $40 rush, lottery and standing room tickets have sold out most nights, pushing capacity over 100%. The success is validating Runyonland's mission, Laub said.",
      "\u201cAlyah doesn\u2019t believe me that I cry every time at the end,\u201d Laub said. Scott laughs. \u201cI just want to assure you, on the record, that I do indeed cry every time.\u201d",
      "The final scene of \u201cJohn Proctor\u201d is a reclamation fueled by rage and \u201cGreen Light.\u201d Capturing that electricity has been key to the show's marketing.",
      "\u201cThe pullup (in \u2018Romeo + Juliet\u2019) is so impactful because it's so real. It's like so exactly what a teenage boy would do,\u201d Taymor said. \u201cI think when you see the girls in \u2018John Proctor\u2019 screaming ... it hits you in a visceral way.\u201d That screaming made the Playbill cover.",
      "\u201cIn my opinion, the look and feel of that campaign feels different from a traditional theatrical campaign, and it feels a lot closer to a film campaign,\u201d Laub said. The show's team indeed considered the zeitgeist-infiltrating work of their sister industries, specifically studios like Neon and A24.",
      "In May, \u201cJohn Proctor is the Villain\u201d finished its second \u201cspirit week\u201d with a school spirit day. Earlier events included an ice cream social \u2014 actors served Van Leeuwen \u2014 a silent disco and a banned book giveaway. For those not in their own school's colors, the merch stand offered T-shirts, including one printed with the Walt Whitman-channeling line said by Sink's Shelby: \u201cI contain frickin' multitudes.\u201d",
      "Julia Lawrence, 26, designed the shirt after the show's team saw her TikTok video reimagining their traditional merch into something more like a concert tee.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s just so incredible to bring Gen Z into the theater that way, especially at a time when theater has never been more important,\u201d Lawrence said. \u201cIn a world that\u2019s overpowered by screens, live art can be such a powerful way to find understanding.\u201d",

      "Jessie J, 37, shared the news in an Instagram video on Wednesday. \u201cI was diagnosed with early breast cancer,\u201d she said in the clip. \u201cCancer sucks in any form, but I\u2019m holding onto the word \u2018early\u2019.\"",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a very dramatic way to get a boob job. I am going to disappear for a bit after Summertime Ball to have my surgery, and I will come back with massive (expletive) and more music.\u201d",
      "The annual Summertime Ball will be held at Wembley Stadium on Sunday, June 15.",
      "She told her social media audience that she felt compelled to share her diagnosis.",
      "\u201cI just wanted to be open and share it,\u201d she said. \u201cOne, because, selfishly, I do not talk about it enough. I\u2019m not processing it because I\u2019m working so hard. I also know how much sharing in the past has helped me with other people giving me their love and support and also their own stories. I\u2019m an open book. It breaks my heart that so many people are going through so much similar and worse \u2013 that\u2019s the bit that kills me.\u201d",
      "The Grammy-nominated Jessie J has long been celebrated for her robust soprano and R&B-informed pop hits, like the 2014 collaboration with Nicki Minaj and Ariana Grande, \u201cBang Bang,\u201d and 2011's \u201cDomino.\u201d",
      "She has released five albums across her career, most recently, 2018's Christmas album, \u201cThis Christmas Day.\u201d She has been releasing new music in 2025, including the singles \u201cLiving My Best Life\u201d and \u201cNo Secrets.\u201d A new album is expected later this year.",
      "She has a son, Sky Safir Cornish Colman, born in 2023.",

      "So vividly drawn is Stephen King\u2019s fiction that it\u2019s offered the basis for some 50 feature films",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Stephen King \u2019s first editor, Bill Thompson, once said, \u201cSteve has a movie camera in his head.\u201d",
      "So vividly drawn is King\u2019s fiction that it\u2019s offered the basis for some 50 feature films. For half a century, since Brian De Palma\u2019s 1976 film \u201cCarrie,\u201d Hollywood has turned, and turned again, to King\u2019s books for their richness of character, nightmare and sheer entertainment.",
      "Open any of those books up at random, and there\u2019s a decent chance you\u2019ll encounter a movie reference, too. Rita Hayworth. \u201cThe Wizard of Oz.\u201d \u201cSingin\u2019 in the Rain.\u201d Sometimes even movies based on King\u2019s books turn up in his novels. That King\u2019s books have been such fodder for the movies is owed, in part, to how much of a moviegoer their author is.",
      "\u201cI love anything from \u2018The 400 Blows\u2019 to something with that guy Jason Statham,\u201d King says, speaking by phone from his home in Maine. \u201cThe worst movie I ever saw was still a great way to spend an afternoon. The only movie I ever walked out on was \u2018Transformers.\u2019 At a certain point I said, \u2018This is just ridiculous.\u2019\u201d",
      "Over time, King has developed a personal policy in how he talks about the adaptations of his books. \u201cMy idea is: If you can\u2019t say something nice, keep your mouth shut,\u201d he says.",
      "The most notable exception was Stanley Kubrick\u2019s \u201cThe Shining,\u201d which King famously called \u201ca big beautiful Cadillac with no engine inside.\u201d But every now and then, King is such a fan of an adaptation that he\u2019s excited to talk about it. That\u2019s very much the case with \u201cThe Life of Chuck,\u201d Mike Flanagan\u2019s new adaptation of King\u2019s novella of the same name published in the 2020 collection \u201cIf It Bleeds.\u201d",
      "In \u201cThe Life of Chuck,\u201d which Neon releases in theaters Friday (nationwide June 13), there are separate storylines but the tone-setting opening is apocalyptic. The internet, like a dazed prize fighter, wobbles on its last legs before going down. California is said to be peeling away from the mainland like \u201clike old wallpaper.\u201d",
      "And yet in this doomsday tale, King is at his most sincere. \u201cThe Life of Chuck,\u201d the book and the movie, is about what matters in life when everything else is lost. There is dancing, Walt Whitman and joy.",
      "\u201cIn \u2018The Life of Chuck,\u2019 we understand that this guy\u2019s life is cut short, but that doesn\u2019t mean he doesn\u2019t experience joy,\u201d says King. \u201cExistential dread and grief and things are part of the human experience, but so is joy.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s telling that when King, our preeminent purveyor of horror, writes about doom times, he ends up scaling it down to a single life. While darkness and doom have, and probably always will, mark his work, King \u2014 a more playful, instinctual, genre-skipping writer than he\u2019s often credited as \u2014 \u201cThe Life of Chuck\u201d is a prime example of King, the humanist.",
      "\u201cAn awful lot of people assume, because he writes so much stuff that\u2019s so scary, they kind of forget the reason his horror works so well is he\u2019s always juxtaposing it with light and with love and with empathy,\u201d says Flanagan, who has twice before adapted King (\u201cDoctor Sleep,\u201d \u201cGerald\u2019s Game\u201d) and is in the midst of making a \u201cCarrie\u201d series for Amazon.",
      "\u201cYou forget that \u2018It\u2019 isn\u2019t about the clown, it\u2019s about the kids and their friendship,\" adds Flanagan. \u201c\u2018The Stand\u2019 isn\u2019t about the virus or the demon taking over the world, it\u2019s ordinary people who have to come together and stand against a force they cannot defeat.\u201d",
      "King, 77, has now written somewhere around 80 books, including the just released \u201cNever Flinch.\u201d The mystery thriller brings back King\u2019s recent favorite protagonist, the private investigator Holly Gibney, who made her stand-alone debut in \u201cIf It Bleeds.\u201d It\u2019s Gibney\u2019s insecurities, and her willingness to push against them, that has kept King returning to her.",
      "\u201cIt gave me great pleasure to see Holly grow into a more confident person,\u201d King says. \u201cShe never outgrows all of her insecurities, though. None of us do.\u201d",
      "\u201cNever Flinch\u201d is a reminder that King has always been less of a genre-first writer than a character-first one. He tends to fall in love with a character and follow them through thick and thin.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m always happy writing. That\u2019s why I do it so much,\u201d King says, chuckling. \u201cI\u2019m a very chipper guy because I get rid of all that dark stuff in the books.\u201d",
      "Dark stuff, as King says, hasn\u2019t been hard to come by lately, he grants. The kind of climate change disaster found in \u201cThe Life of Chuck,\u201d King says, often dominates his anxieties.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re creeping up little by little on being the one country who does not acknowledge it\u2019s a real problem with carbon in the atmosphere,\u201d King says. \u201cThat\u2019s crazy. Certain right wing politicians can talk all they want about how we\u2019re saving the world for our grandchildren. They don\u2019t care about that. They care about money.\u201d",
      "On social media, King has been a sometimes critic of President Donald Trump, whose second term has included battles with the arts, academia and public financing for PBS and NPR. Over the next four years, King predicts, \u201cCulture is going to go underground.\u201d",
      "In \u201cNever Finch,\u201d Holly Gibney is hired as a bodyguard by a women\u2019s rights activist whose lecture tour is being plagued by mysterious acts of violence. In the afterward of the book, King includes a tribute to \u201csupporters of women\u2019s right to choose who have been murdered for doing their duty.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m sure they\u2019re not going to like that,\u201d King says of right-wing critics.",
      "The original germ for \u201cThe Life of Chuck\u201d had nothing to do with current events. One day in Boston, King noticed a drummer busking on Boylston Street. He had the vision of a businessman in a suit who, walking by, can\u2019t resist dancing with abandon to the drummer\u2019s beat.",
      "King, a self-acknowledged dancer (though only in private, he notes), latched onto a story that would turn on the unpredictable nature of people, tracing the inner life of that imagined passerby. In the film, he\u2019s played by Tom Hiddleston. Chuck first appears, oddly, on a billboard that haunts and confuses a local teacher (Chiwetel Ejiofor) who's struggling to get his students to care about literature or education with the possible end of the world encroaching.",
      "It\u2019s a funny but maybe not coincidental irony that many of the best King adaptations, like \u201cStand By Me\u201d and \u201cThe Shawshank Redemption,\" have come from the author\u2019s more warm-hearted tales. \u201cThe Life of Chuck,\u201d which won the People\u2019s Choice Award last fall at the Toronto International Film Festival, is after a similar spirit.",
      "When King reached out about attending the TIFF world premiere, Flanagan was shocked. The last time King had done that for one of his own adaptations was 26 years ago, for \u201cThe Green Mile.\u201d That movie, like \u201cThe Shawshank Redemption\u201d were box-office disappointments, King recalls, a fate he's hoping \u201cThe Life of Chuck\u201d can avoid.",
      "\u201cHe views this movie as something that\u2019s a bit precious,\u201d says Flanagan. \u201cHe\u2019s said a few things to me in the past about how earnest it is, how this is a story without an ounce of cynicism. As it was being released into a cynical world, I think he felt protective of it. I think this one really means something to him.\u201d",
      "The Stephen King industrial complex, meanwhile, keeps rolling along. Coming just this year are series of \u201cWelcome to Derry\u201d and \u201cThe Institute\u201d and a film of \u201cThe Long Walk.\u201d King, himself, just finished a draft of \u201cTalisman 3.\u201d",
      "If \u201cThe Life of Chuck\u201d has particular meaning to King, it could be because it represents something intrinsic about his own life. Chuck's small, seemingly unremarkable existence has grace and meaning because, as Whitman is quoted, he \"contains multitudes\u201d that surprise and delight him. King's fiction is evidence \u2014 heaps of it \u2014 that he does, too.",
      "\u201cThere are some days where I sit down and I think, \u2018This is going to be a really good day,\u2019 and it\u2019s not, at all,\u201d says King. \u201cThen other days I sit down and think to myself, \u2018I\u2019m really tired and don\u2019t feel like doing this,\u2019 and then it catches fire. You never know what you\u2019re going to get.\u201d",

      "President Donald Trump\u2019s National Institutes of Health director says some employees\u2019 critical letter to him has \u201cfundamental misconceptions about the policy directions the NIH has taken.\u201d",
      "WASHINGTON -- In his confirmation hearings to lead the National Institutes of Health, Jay Bhattacharya pledged his openness to views that might conflict with his own. \u201cDissent,\" he said, \u201dis the very essence of science.\u201d",
      "That commitment is being put to the test.",
      "On Monday, scores of scientists at the agency sent their Trump-appointed leader a letter titled the Bethesda Declaration, challenging \u201cpolicies that undermine the NIH mission, waste public resources, and harm the health of Americans and people across the globe.\u201d",
      "It says: \"We dissent.\"",
      "In a capital where insiders often insist on anonymity to say such things publicly, 92 NIH researchers, program directors, branch chiefs and scientific review officers put their signatures on the letter \u2014 and their careers on the line. An additional 250 of their colleagues across the agency endorsed the declaration without using their names.",
      "The four-page letter, addressed to Bhattacharya, also was sent to Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and members of Congress who oversee the NIH. White House spokesman Kush Desai defended the administration's approach to federal research and said President Donald Trump is focused on restoring a \u201cGold Standard\u201d of science, not \u201cideological activism.\u201d",
      "The signers went public in the face of a \u201cculture of fear and suppression\u201d they say Trump's administration has spread through the federal civil service. \u201cWe are compelled to speak up when our leadership prioritizes political momentum over human safety and faithful stewardship of public resources,\u201d the declaration says.",
      "Bhattacharya responded to the declaration by saying it \u201chas some fundamental misconceptions about the policy directions the NIH has taken in recent months.\"",
      "\u201cNevertheless, respectful dissent in science is productive,\u201d he said in a statement. \"We all want the NIH to succeed.\u201d",
      "Named for the agency's headquarters location in Maryland, the Bethesda Declaration details upheaval in the world\u2019s premier public health research institution over the course of mere months.",
      "It addresses the termination of 2,100 research grants valued at more than $12 billion and some of the human costs that have resulted, such as cutting off medication regimens to participants in clinical trials or leaving them with unmonitored device implants.",
      "In one case, an NIH-supported study of multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis in Haiti had to be stopped, ceasing antibiotic treatment mid-course for patients.",
      "In a number of cases, trials that were mostly completed were rendered useless without the money to finish and analyze the work, the letter says. \u201cEnding a $5 million research study when it is 80% complete does not save $1 million,\u201d it says, \u201cit wastes $4 million.\u201d",
      "Jenna Norton, who oversees health disparity research at the agency's National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, recently appeared at a forum by Sen. Angela Alsobrooks, D-Md., to talk about what's happening at the NIH.",
      "At the event, she masked to conceal her identity. Now the mask is off. She was a lead organizer of the declaration.",
      "\u201cI want people to know how bad things are at NIH,\" Norton told The Associated Press.",
      "The signers said they modeled their indictment after Bhattacharya\u2019s Great Barrington Declaration in 2020, when he was a professor at Stanford University Medical School.",
      "His declaration drew together likeminded infectious disease epidemiologists and public health scientists who dissented from what they saw as excessive COVID-19 lockdown policies and felt ostracized by the larger public health community that pushed those policies, including the NIH.",
      "\u201cHe is proud of his statement, and we are proud of ours,\" said Sarah Kobrin, a branch chief at the NIH's National Cancer Institute who signed the Bethesda Declaration.",
      "As chief of the Health Systems and Interventions Research Branch, Kobrin provides scientific oversight of researchers across the country who've been funded by the cancer institute or want to be. Cuts in personnel and money have shifted her work from improving cancer care research to what she sees as minimizing its destruction. \"So much of it is gone \u2014 my work,\u201d she said.",
      "The 21-year NIH veteran said she signed because she didn't want to be \"a collaborator\u201d in the political manipulation of biomedical science.",
      "Ian Morgan, a postdoctoral fellow with the National Institute of General Medical Sciences, also signed the declaration. \u201cWe have a saying in basic science,\u201d he said. \u201cYou go and become a physician if you want to treat thousands of patients. You go and become a researcher if you want to save billions of patients.",
      "\u201cWe are doing the research that is going to go and create the cures of the future,\u201d he added. But that won\u2019t happen, he said, if Trump's Republican administration prevails with its searing grant cuts.",
      "The NIH employees interviewed by the AP emphasized they were speaking for themselves and not for their institutes nor the NIH.",
      "Employees from all 27 NIH institutes and centers gave their support to the declaration. Most who signed are intimately involved with evaluating and overseeing extramural research grants.",
      "The letter asserts \u201cNIH trials are being halted without regard to participant safety\u201d and the agency is shirking commitments to trial participants who \u201cbraved personal risk to give the incredible gift of biological samples, understanding that their generosity would fuel scientific discovery and improve health.\u201d",
      "The Trump administration has gone at public health research on several fronts, both directly, as part of its broad effort to root out diversity, equity and inclusion values throughout the bureaucracy, and as part of its drive to starve some universities of federal money.",
      "At the White House, Desai said Americans \u201chave lost confidence in our increasingly politicized healthcare and research apparatus that has been obsessed with DEI and COVID, which the majority of Americans moved on from years ago.\u201d",
      "This has forced \u201cindiscriminate grant terminations, payment freezes for ongoing research, and blanket holds on awards regardless of the quality, progress, or impact of the science,\u201d the declaration says.",
      "Some NIH employees have previously come forward in televised protests to air grievances, and many walked out of Bhattacharya's town hall with staff. The declaration is the first cohesive effort to register agency-wide dismay with the NIH's direction.",
      "The dissenters remind Bhattacharya in their letter of his oft-stated ethic that academic freedom must be a lynchpin in science.",
      "With that in place, he said in a statement in April, \u201cNIH scientists can be certain they are afforded the ability to engage in open, academic discourse as part of their official duties and in their personal capacities without risk of official interference, professional disadvantage or workplace retaliation.\"",
      "Now it will be seen whether that's enough to protect those NIH employees challenging the Trump administration and him.",
      "\u201cThere's a book I read to my kids, and it talks about how you can't be brave if you're not scared,\u201d said Norton, who has three young children. \"I am so scared about doing this, but I am trying to be brave for my kids because it's only going to get harder to speak up.",
      "\u201cMaybe I'm putting my kids at risk by doing this,\" she added. \"And I'm doing it anyway because I couldn't live with myself otherwise.\u201d",
      "e and noy on",
      "\u201cIn recent years, Americans have lost confidence in our increasingly politicized healthcare and research apparatus that has been obsessed with DEI and COVID, which the majority of Americans moved on from years ago,\u201d spokesman Kush Desai said. \u201cThe Trump administration is focused on restoring the Gold Standard of Science \u2014 not ideological activism \u2014 as the guiding principle of HHS, the NIH, and the CDC to finally address our chronic disease epidemic.\u201d",

Knowing exactly how much, and what it may be doing to the people who live there, is why Brockman got involved with a local environmental organization that\u2019s installing air and water quality monitors in her community.",
      "\u201cIndustry and government is very, very, very powerful. It\u2019s more powerful than me. I\u2019m just an English teacher,\u201d Brockman said. But she wants to feel she can make a difference.",
      "In a way, Brockman\u2019s monitoring echoes the reporting that the Environmental Protection Agency began requiring from large polluters more than a decade ago. Emissions from four coal-fired plants in southwest Indiana have dropped 60% since 2010, when the rule took effect.",
      "That rule is now on the chopping block, one of many that President Donald Trump\u2019s EPA argues is costly and burdensome for industry.",
      "But experts say dropping the requirement risks a big increase in emissions if companies are no longer publicly accountable for what they put in the air. And they say losing the data \u2014 at the same time the EPA is cutting air quality monitoring elsewhere \u2014 would make it tougher to fight climate change.",
      "At stake is the Greenhouse Gas Reporting program, a 2009 rule from President Barack Obama's administration that affects large carbon polluters like refineries, power plants, wells and landfills. In the years since, they've collectively reported a 20% drop in emissions, mostly driven by the closure of coal plants.",
      "And what happens at these big emitters makes a difference. Their declining emissions account for more than three-quarters of the overall, if modest, decline in all U.S. greenhouse gas emissions since 2010.",
      "The registry includes places not usually thought of as big polluters but that have notable greenhouse gas emissions, such as college campuses, breweries and cereal factories. Even Walt Disney World in Florida, where pollution dropped 62% since 2010, has to report along with nearly 10,600 other places.",
      "\"We can\u2019t solve climate change without knowing how much pollution major facilities are emitting and how that\u2019s changing over time,\" said Jeremy Symons, a former EPA senior climate adviser now at Environmental Protection Network, an organization of ex-EPA officials that monitors environmental policies. The group provided calculations as a part of The Associated Press' analysis of impacts from proposed rule rollbacks.",
      "Symons said some companies would welcome the end of the registry because it would make it easier to pollute.",
      "It\u2019s not clear how much the registry itself has contributed to declining emissions. More targeted regulations on smokestack emissions, as well as coal being crowded out by cheaper and less polluting natural gas, are bigger factors.",
      "But the registry \u201cdoes put pressure on companies to ... document what they\u2019ve done or at least to provide a baseline for what they\u2019ve done,\u201d said Stanford University climate scientist Rob Jackson, who heads Global Carbon Project, a group of scientists that tally national carbon emissions yearly.",
      "Gina McCarthy, a former EPA administrator under Obama, said the registry makes clear how power plants are doing against each other, and that's an inducement to lower emissions.",
      "\"It is money for those companies. It's costs. It's reputation. It's been, I think, a wonderful success story and I hope it continues.\u201d",
      "The potential end of the reporting requirement comes as experts say much of the country's air goes unmonitored. Nelson Arley Roque, a Penn State professor who co-authored a study in April on these \u201cmonitoring deserts,\u201d said about 40% of U.S. lands are unmonitored. That often includes poor and rural neighborhoods.",
      "\"The air matters to all of us, but apparently 50 million people can\u2019t know or will never know'' how bad the air is, Roque said.",
      "The EPA is also trying to claw back money that had been earmarked for air monitoring, part of the termination of grants that it has labeled as targeting diversity, equity and inclusion. That includes $500,000 that would have funded 40 air monitors in a low-income and minority community in the Charlotte, North Carolina, area.",
      "CleaneAIRE NC, a nonprofit that works to improve air quality across the state that was awarded the grant, is suing.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not diversity, equity and inclusion. It\u2019s human rights,\u201d said Daisha Wall, the group's community science program manager. \u201cWe all deserve a right to clean air.\u201d",
      "Research strongly links poor air quality to diseases like asthma and heart disease, with a slightly less established link to cancer. Near polluting industries, experts say what\u2019s often lacking is either enough data in specific locations or the will to investigate the health toll.",
      "Indiana says it \u201cmaintains a robust statewide monitoring and assessment program for air, land and water,\u201d but Brockman and others in this part of the state aren't satisfied. She and other members of local advocacy groups Southwestern Indiana Citizens for Quality of Life and Valley Watch install and maintain their own air and water quality monitors. It\u2019s a full-time job to keep the network of monitors up and running, fighting spotty Wi-Fi and connectivity issues.",
      "Fighting industry is a sensitive subject, Brockman added. Many families depend on jobs at coal-fired power plants, and poverty is real. She keeps snacks in her desk for the kids who haven\u2019t eaten breakfast.",
      "\u201cBut you also don\u2019t want to hear of another student that has a rare cancer,\u201d she said.",

      "Canada\u2019s wildfire season is off to an intense start",
      "While images of wildfires capture their ferocity, data can provide insight into how bad a fire season is.",
      "Such is the case with two graphics, powered by satellite data, that showcase a Canadian wildfire season off to a wild \u2014 and scary \u2014 start.",
      "Twice a day a NASA satellite sends images to the ground, giving a real-time view of where fires are burning. This is especially useful for remote areas where no sensors are stationed.",
      "As of Tuesday that satellite had picked up four times as many fire hot spots across Canada than is typical for early June. That\u2019s more than any year since the satellite began transmitting in 2012, except 2023, according to data from Global Forest Watch.",
      "Though the satellite has recorded thousands of hot spots so far this year, that does not mean there are actually that many active fires. Each hot spot could be detected repeatedly over the course of days. And because each detection is about the size of 26 football fields, it can represent part of a much larger blaze, said James MacCarthy, wildfire research manager at Global Forest Watch.",
      "Based on data from the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre, about 200 fires are actively burning in Canada and have consumed about 7,700 square miles (19,900 square kilometers) of terrain, most of it in the last week.",
      "Only 2023 saw such high numbers so early in Canada's fire season, which runs from April through October. That year wildfires burned a record 67,000 square miles \u2014 more than twice the surface area of Lake Superior, the largest of the Great Lakes.",
      "Taken together, the hot spots and acres burned mean 2025 is the second-worst start to the season in years.",
      "\u201cA warm and dry finish to May and early June has created a significant fire season,\u201d said Liam Buchart, a fire weather specialist with the Canadian Forest Service.",
      "The weather conditions are made more likely by climate change and encourage wildfires to start. That means even though 90% of wildfires in Manitoba this year have been human-caused, according to the provincial government, climate change helps enable their spread.",
      "\u201cClimate change is creating the conditions that make it more likely that human-caused fires are going to spread, or even start,\u201d MacCarthy said. \u201cIt might be a human starting it, but it\u2019s going to spread quickly because now there\u2019s hot and dry conditions that are occurring more frequently and more intensely than they have in the past.\u201d",
      "The hot and dry weather is likely to to continue for at least the next week across Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta, according to Natural Resources Canada. The agency\u2019s forecasts also call for \u201ca warmer and drier than normal July and August for large portions of Canada,\u201d Buchart said.",
      "\u201cThe remainder of the fire season looks to remain above normal, especially over the northern prairie provinces and southern British Columbia,\u201d he said.",

      "Childhood vaccination rates against measles fell in the years after the COVID-19 pandemic in nearly 80% of the more than 2,000 U.S. counties with available data \u2014 including in states that are battling outbreaks this year.",
      "A Johns Hopkins University study, published in JAMA this week, illustrates where more vulnerable communities are located. The results mirror trends established at state and national levels: Routine childhood vaccination rates are dropping.",
      "\u201cWhen you look at the state level or national level ... you really don\u2019t see those drastic drops. Those are there. They\u2019re real and they\u2019re really problematic,\u201d said Lauren Gardner, an expert in infectious disease modeling at Johns Hopkins University who is the paper\u2019s senior author. Gardner also built the university\u2019s COVID-19 database.",
      "Most of the measles cases in the U.S. this year \u2014 1,088 nationally as of Friday \u2014 are in unvaccinated people. It has been spreading among communities due to international and domestic travel. Three people have died from measles during this year's outbreaks, and 2025 is inching closer to becoming the worst for measles in more than three decades.",
      "Measles was eliminated in the U.S. in 2000, and the vaccine is safe and highly effective. Public schools nationwide require two doses of the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine before kindergarten, but the number of children with non-medical exemptions from those requirements hit an all-time high in the 2023-2024 school year. Health experts say community-level vaccination needs to be at 95% or higher to prevent outbreaks.",
      "The Johns Hopkins study looked at 2,066 counties across 33 states, comparing kindergarten vaccination rates averaged over school years from 2017-2020 to averages from 2022-2024. Where kindergarten data wasn\u2019t available, the researchers used a comparable rate.",
      "Here's what it looks like in counties where there have been outbreaks this year, including in Texas counties that are the epicenter of measles.",
      "Texas has logged 742 measles cases since late January, most in West Texas.",
      "Gaines County has 411 cases, the most in the state. Almost 2% of its population got measles. While the county saw a two percentage-point increase in vaccination rates after the pandemic, its 82.4% rate remains below herd immunity.",
      "Terry County (60 cases) and Yoakum County (20 cases) dropped below the 95% threshold for herd immunity after the pandemic, to 93.7% and 91.8% respectively.",
      "Lubbock County \u2014 which has seen 53 cases and is the closest metro area to Gaines County \u2014 was just below 95% before the pandemic, but dropped three percentage points after to 91.8%.",
      "El Paso County on the border of Mexico has had the third-most measles cases in Texas this year with 57. Its vaccination rate is higher than 95% but saw a 2.1 percentage-point decline to 96.5%.",
      "Counties with outbreaks in Kansas include Gray with 25 cases, Haskell with 11 and and Stevens with seven.",
      "Vaccination rates in Gray County dropped 23 percentage points after the pandemic, from 94% to 71%.",
      "Haskell County dropped 18 percentage points to 65%. And Stevens County dropped 0.5 percentage points to 90.5%.",
      "Colorado's outbreak, which is linked to an international flight that landed at the Denver airport in mid-May, involves six cases: five in state residents and one out-of-state traveler.",
      "Two people who got measles live in Arapahoe County in the Denver metro, where the vaccination rate dropped 3.5 percentage points to 88.4%. Three others live in El Paso County, home to Colorado Springs, where the vaccination rate dropped 3.8 percentage points to 80% post-pandemic.",
      "Pre-pandemic data in North Dakota wasn't available to Johns Hopkins researchers, but they looked at rates from school years ending in 2022, 2023 and 2024.",
      "North Dakota's first outbreak started in Williams County, which now has 16 measles cases. In the timeframe researchers looked at, vaccination rates in Williams rose from 84.6% in 2022 to 87.7% in 2023, only to drop back to 83.5% in 2024.",

    "story": [
      "It might start when you realize you can\u2019t hear the doorbell, or certain ringtones",
      "NEW YORK -- My first tip-off were the little things, the high-pitched little things: the doorbell and ringtones my kids could hear but I could not.",
      "Then it was the garbled-sounding conversations, and the accompanying annoyance of having to ask people to repeat themselves. Or worse, giving up and just playing along without being able to follow everything that was being said.",
      "Even then, I stalled for years before finally going through the process of getting a hearing aid. How do you even begin? Will it look clunky and make me feel like a dinosaur? And the cost!",
      "Getting a hearing test, and confirmation that I needed a hearing aid, was just the beginning.",
      "The doctor handed me a list of places I could go to get fitted. I made some calls and narrowed it down to the places that took my insurance and my zero-interest health care credit card.",
      "The first couple places were demoralizing: I walked in, was told it\u2019d be $7,000 for the \u201cbest\u201d option (they mysteriously didn\u2019t happen to have any other options handy), then marched right back out the door, utterly discouraged.",
      "I started asking friends and neighbors whether they wore a hearing aid, or knew anyone at all with a hearing aid, and could point me to a good audiologist.",
      "It took a lot of poking around, but I found one \u2014 and it made all the difference.",
      "I\u2019ve been wearing my hearing aids for several months now, and they are as easy as slipping on a pair of glasses, are almost invisible, have reconnected me with the world, and, as crazy as this may sound, they bring me joy.",
      "After talking with a few audiologists around the country, it turns out that my experience is pretty typical.",
      "\u201cThere are a lot of people who stall before getting one,\u201d says Meagan P. Bachmann, director of audiology at Atrium Health Wake Forest Baptist, in North Carolina.",
      "\u201cHearing is important because it connects us with people,\u201d she says. \u201cMultiple studies show that not hearing can affect your ability to connect with others and participate in life, so you have to think of it in terms of overall health. Maybe you no longer go to family events, or you don\u2019t understand your doctor. People start to withdraw. A lot of people come in because it\u2019s gotten so bad that it is impacting their relationships.\u201d",
      "To speed up the process and make it less frustrating, here\u2019s what the pros recommend:",
      "1. Get tested, take the results seriously, and know that many if not most hearing aids these days are small, nearly invisible, rechargeable, and pretty easy to wear and maintain. And believe it or not, hearing aids can be fun \u2014 these days, there are colors to choose from and ways to bejewel them. One company, Deafmetal, makes jazzy-looking \u201csafety rings\u201d to help keep hearing aids in place.",
      "2. Shop for an expert audiologist. Look for someone who takes your insurance or any sort of medical credit card you might have, or has a payment plan of some kind, if needed. This is a world at the awkward juncture of consumerism and medical care, but a good audiologist should come across as a medical provider, not a salesperson. And a good audiologist should take the time to work with you to find a hearing aid that meets your individual needs, and also fits your budget.",
      "A good place to start is often with your doctor; with the American Academy of Audiologists, which lists providers on its website; or by word of mouth.",
      "\u201cAlthough all hearing aids are amplifiers, not everybody needs the same thing,\u201d says Bachmann. \u201cFitting a hearing aid is an art. It changes the acoustics, and everyone is different. You want someone who listens to your lifestyle needs. Do you have a lot of difficulty with noise? Are you mostly in quiet situations? How much technology do you need, and what kind?\u201d",
      "Greta Stamper, an audiologist at the Mayo Clinic in Jacksonville, Florida, agrees. \u201cHearing loss is not a one-time thing. It\u2019s a chronic health condition. It should be a partnership between you and your audiologist,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s someone asking you what you\u2019re looking for and how it\u2019s going. You shouldn\u2019t feel pressured or pushed.\u201d",
      "3. A note on cost. Although hearing aids can be pricey, there are affordable options, and a good audiologist should be able to let you try out options at several price points. Insurance often covers much of the cost, and there are ways to pay for the remaining cost in installments. Also, avoidance has pretty high costs as well, audiologists say, and the longer the wait, the harder it may be to solve the problem with a hearing aid. Although there are cheaper hearing aids at big box stores, Bachmann warns that it\u2019s good to check with your audiologist before taking that route. \u201cSome of those hearing aids are locked, so that you\u2019re not allowed to have them programmed by an outside audiologist,\u201d she says.",
      "Remember, says Stamper, that hearing aids are an investment, and usually last between five and six years.",
      "4. Know your rights. \u201cWe select what is the most likely to be successful, and if it doesn\u2019t work out you come back and do something else,\u201d says Stamper. She said most states mandate a trial period. In some cases, hearing-aid companies also cover the cost of multiple visits to your audiologist while you are getting used to your new hearing aid and get training in how to use and maintain it.",
      "5. Embrace the process, and expect it to take a little time and a few expert tweaks. Audiologists say your brain needs time to adjust to a hearing aid, and that hearing-aid settings should be adjusted little by little as your brain adapts to them.",
      "\u201cA big misconception is that you can just wear them a couple hours a day. Your brain does better with it if you use them most of the day. Your brain needs to adapt to hearing sounds it hasn't heard for a while, and it takes the brain awhile to relearn how to process all those sounds,\u201d says Stamper.",
      "6. Be realistic. \u201cAlthough hearing aids can be enormously beneficial, they may not give you back your normal hearing,\u201d says Stamper. Depending on the situation, there might be limitations to what a hearing aid can do.",
      "\u201cIt might just be lots of improvement in the key areas in which you\u2019re struggling,\u201d said Stamper.",
      "Using hearing aids is a process, the audiologists say, and although it requires some patience, it can be well worth the journey.",

    "story": [
      "A federal investigation has found that a Texas hospital that repeatedly sent a woman who was bleeding and in pain home without ending her nonviable, life-threatening pregnancy violated the law",
      "WASHINGTON -- A Texas hospital that repeatedly sent a woman who was bleeding and in pain home without ending her nonviable, life-threatening pregnancy violated the law, according to a newly released federal investigation.",
      "The government's findings, which have not been previously reported, were a small victory for 36-year-old Kyleigh Thurman, who ultimately lost part of her reproductive system after being discharged without any help from her hometown emergency room for her dangerous ectopic pregnancy.",
      "But a new policy the Trump administration announced on Tuesday has thrown into doubt the federal government's oversight of hospitals that deny women emergency abortions, even when they are at risk for serious infection, organ loss or severe hemorrhaging.",
      "Thurman had hoped the federal government's investigation, which issued a report in April after concluding its inquiry last year, would send a clear message that ectopic pregnancies must be treated by hospitals in Texas, which has one of the nation's strictest abortion bans.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t want anyone else to have to go through this,\u201d Thurman said in an interview with the Associated Press from her Texas home this week. \u201cI put a lot of the responsibility on the state of Texas and policy makers and the legislators that set this chain of events off.\u201d",
      "Women around the country have been denied emergency abortions for their life-threatening pregnancies after states swiftly enacted abortion restrictions in response to a 2022 ruling from the U.S. Supreme Court, which includes three appointees of President Donald Trump.",
      "The guidance issued by the Biden administration in 2022 was an effort to preserve access to emergency abortions for extreme cases in which women were experiencing medical emergencies. It directed hospitals \u2014 even ones in states with severe restrictions \u2014 to provide abortions in those emergency cases. If hospitals did not comply, they would be in violation of a federal law and risk losing some federal funds.",
      "On Tuesday, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the federal agency responsible for enforcing the law and inspecting hospitals, announced it would revoke the Biden-era guidance around emergency abortions.",
      "The law, which requires doctors to provide stabilizing treatment, was one of the few ways that Thurman was able to hold the emergency room accountable after she didn't receive any help from staff at Ascension Seton Williamson in Round Rock, Texas in February of 2023, a few months after Texas enacted its strict abortion ban.",
      "Emergency room staff observed that Thurman's hormone levels had dropped, a pregnancy was not visible in her uterus and a structure was blocking her fallopian tube \u2014 all telltale signs of an ectopic pregnancy, when a fetus implants outside of the uterus and has no room to grow. If left untreated, ectopic pregnancies can rupture, causing organ damage, hemorrhage or even death.",
      "Thurman, however, was sent home and given a pamphlet on miscarriage for her first pregnancy. She returned three days later, still bleeding, and was given an injected drug intended to end the pregnancy, but it was too late. Days later, she showed up again at the emergency room, bleeding out because the fertilized egg growing on Thurman\u2019s fallopian tube ruptured it. She underwent an emergency surgery that removed part of her reproductive system.",
      "CMS launched its investigation of how Ascension Seton Williamson handled Thurman\u2019s case late last year, shortly after she filed a complaint. Investigators concluded the hospital failed to give her a proper medical screening exam, including an evaluation with an OB-GYN. The hospital violated the federal Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act, which requires emergency rooms to provide stabilizing treatment to all patients. Thurman was \u201cat risk for deterioration of her health and wellbeing as a result of an untreated medical condition,\u201d the investigation said in its report, which was publicly released last month.",
      "Ascension, a vast hospital system that has facilities across multiple states, did not respond to questions about Thurman\u2019s case, saying only that it is \u201cis committed to providing high-quality care to all who seek our services.\u201d",
      "Doctors and legal experts have warned abortion restrictions like the one Texas enacted have discouraged emergency room staff from aborting dangerous and nonviable pregnancies, even when a woman's life is imperiled. The stakes are especially high in Texas, where doctors face up to 99 years in prison if convicted of performing an illegal abortion. Lawmakers in the state are weighing a law that would remove criminal penalties for doctors who provide abortions in certain medical emergencies.",
      "\u201cWe see patients with miscarriages being denied care, bleeding out in parking lots. We see patients with nonviable pregnancies being told to continue those to term,\u201d said Molly Duane, an attorney at the Center for Reproductive Rights that represented Thurman. \u201cThis is not, maybe, what some people thought abortion bans would look like, but this is the reality.\u201d",
      "The Biden administration routinely warned hospitals that they need to provide abortions when a woman\u2019s health was in jeopardy, even suing Idaho over its state law that initially prohibited nearly all abortions, unless a woman\u2019s life was on the line.",
      "But CMS\u2019 announcement on Tuesday raises questions about whether such investigations will continue if hospitals do not provide abortions for women in medical emergencies.",
      "The agency said it will still enforce the law, \u201cincluding for identified emergency medical conditions that place the health of a pregnant woman or her unborn child in serious jeopardy.\u201d",
      "While states like Texas have clarified that ectopic pregnancies can legally be treated with abortions, the laws do not provide for every complication that might arise during a pregnancy. Several women in Texas have sued the state for its law, which has prevented women from terminating pregnancies in cases where their fetuses had deadly fetal anomalies or they went into labor too early for the fetus to survive.",
      "Thurman worries pregnant patients with serious complications still won't be able to get the help they may need in Texas emergency rooms.",
      "\u201cYou cannot predict the ways a pregnancy can go,\u201d Thurman said. \u201cIt can happen to anyone, still. There\u2019s still so many ways in which pregnancies that aren\u2019t ectopic can be deadly.\u201d",

      "The fact that the COVID-19 vaccine is not available for newborn babies is shielding a group of prisoners on Georgia\u2019s death row from execution",
      "ATLANTA -- The fact that the COVID-19 vaccine is not available for newborn babies is shielding a group of prisoners on Georgia's death row from execution.",
      "Executions in Georgia were halted during the COVID-19 pandemic, and the state attorney general's office entered into an agreement with lawyers for people on death row to set the terms under which they could resume for a specific group of prisoners. At least one of those conditions, having to do with the availability of the COVID-19 vaccine, has not been met, and seeking an execution date for a prisoner covered by the agreement would breach the agreement, Fulton County Superior Court Judge Shukura Ingram ruled.",
      "The agreement includes three conditions that had to be met before executions could be set for the affected prisoners: the expiration of the state\u2019s COVID-19 judicial emergency, the resumption of normal visitation at state prisons and the availability of a COVID-19 vaccine \u201cto all members of the public.\u201d Once those conditions were met, the state agreed to give three months' notice before pursuing an execution warrant for one of the prisoners covered by the agreement and six months' notice for the rest.",
      "The state has argued that the agreement should no longer apply, contending the conditions have been met. But defense attorneys say it's still valid because the vaccine isn't yet available to infants under 6 months old, and visitation at state prisons has not returned to normal.",
      "Ingram's ruling, issued Friday, addressed only the vaccination question. She plans to handle the visitation issue separately.",
      "Ingram wrote that the state's arguments \u201call boil down to an attempt to rewrite the Agreement.\u201d The state is \u201c(u)nhappy with the language it drafted\u201d and wants to change it so that the condition would be satisfied once vaccines are available to \u201cmost members of the public.\u201d",
      "\u201cBut courts cannot rewrite contracts to relieve a party of their regrets,\u201d she wrote. She ruled that the agreement is \u201cbinding and enforceable,\u201d that the vaccination condition hasn't been met and that seeking an execution warrant before the requirements have been met would breach the agreement.",
      "The state attorney general's office plans to appeal, a spokesperson said Tuesday.",
      "Ingram noted that the Food and Drug Administration has approved clinical trials for infants under 6 months old, and newborns receive other vaccines. That shows it is possible for the COVID-19 vaccine to ultimately be available for that age group, and the state should have foreseen that that could take years, she wrote.",
      "Experts for both sides had testified that it was probable that the COVID-19 vaccine would eventually become available to babies under the age of 6 months, Ingram wrote.",
      "That was before Robert F. Kennedy Jr. was appointed U.S. health secretary. Kennedy last week announced that COVID-19 vaccines are no longer recommended for healthy children and pregnant women. A few days later, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's website, which had said those groups should get the shots, was revised to say the vaccinations \u201cmay\u201d be given to those groups.",
      "The agreement covers fewer than 10 of the 34 people currently on Georgia's death row.",
      "While Georgia stopped carrying out executions during the pandemic, death penalty cases continued to wind their way through the court system, and as people exhausted their appeals, they became eligible for execution.",
      "A committee of a judicial task force on COVID-19 in early 2021 instructed lawyers for people on death row and the state attorney general\u2019s office to come up with terms under which executions could safely resume. The two sides reached the agreement in April 2021.",
      "The agreement only applied to people on death row whose requests to have their appeals reheard were denied by the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals while the judicial emergency was in place. The agreement was to remain in effect through Aug. 1, 2022, or one year from the date on which the conditions were met \u2014 whichever was later.",
      "The legal fight arose from a lawsuit filed when officials set a May 2022 execution date for Virgil Delano Presnell Jr. The Federal Defender Program, which represents Presnell, said the state had violated the agreement because the conditions hadn\u2019t all been met.",
      "Based on that argument, a Fulton County Superior Court judge halted the execution less than 24 hours before it was to take place, and the Georgia Supreme Court ruled in December 2022 that the agreement was a binding contract.",
      "People on death row who are not covered by the agreement have since become eligible for execution. One of them, Willie James Pye, was put to death in March 2024.",

    "story": [
      "A judge says the federal Bureau of Prisons must keep providing hormone therapy to hundreds of transgender inmates following an executive order signed by President Donald Trump that led to a disruption in medical treatment",
      "WASHINGTON -- The federal Bureau of Prisons must continue providing hormone therapy and social accommodations to hundreds of transgender inmates following an executive order signed by President Donald Trump that led to a disruption in medical treatment, a federal judge ruled Tuesday.",
      "U.S. District Judge Royce Lamberth said in his ruling a federal law prohibits prison officials from arbitrarily depriving inmates of medications and other lifestyle accommodations that the bureau's own medical staff has deemed appropriate.",
      "The judge said the transgender inmates who sued to block Trump\u2019s executive order are trying to lessen the personal anguish caused by their gender dysphoria, the distress that a person feels because their assigned gender and gender identity don\u2019t match.",
      "\u201cIn light of the plaintiffs\u2019 largely personal motives for undergoing gender-affirming care, neither the BOP nor the Executive Order provides any serious explanation as to why the treatment modalities covered by the Executive Order or implementing memoranda should be handled differently than any other mental health intervention,\u201d the judge wrote.",
      "The Bureau of Prisons is providing hormone therapy to more than 600 inmates diagnosed with gender dysphoria. The bureau doesn\u2019t dispute that gender dysphoria can cause severe side effects, including depression, anxiety and suicidal thoughts, the judge said.",
      "The Republican president\u2019s executive order required the bureau to revise its medical care policies so that federal funds aren\u2019t spent \u201cfor the purpose of conforming an inmate\u2019s appearance to that of the opposite sex.\u201d",
      "Lamberth\u2019s ruling isn\u2019t limited to the plaintiffs named in the lawsuit. He agreed to certify a class of plaintiffs consisting of anyone who is or will be incarcerated in federal prisons.",
      "The lawsuit\u2019s named plaintiffs include Alishea Kingdom, a transgender woman who was prescribed hormone therapy injections and approved to receive social accommodations, including women\u2019s undergarments and cosmetics. Kingdom was denied her hormone shot three times after Trump signed his order, but she had it restored roughly a week after she sued. Her access to feminine undergarments hasn\u2019t been restored, according to the judge\u2019s ruling.",
      "\u201cIn Ms. Kingdom\u2019s case, there is no indication at all that the BOP means to leave her hormone therapy in place long-term; indeed, as noted above, she was informed by BOP personnel that the decision to resume her treatment was a consequence of this litigation itself, raising the specter that her treatments might be discontinued as soon as the litigation has concluded,\u201d Lamberth wrote.",
      "Trump\u2019s order also directed the Bureau of Prisons to ensure that \u201cmales are not detained in women\u2019s prisons.\u201d In February, however, Lamberth agreed to temporarily block prison officials from transferring three incarcerated transgender women to men\u2019s facilities and terminating their access to hormone therapy.",
      "The judge said there's no evidence Trump or prison officials considered the harm the new polices could do to transgender inmates.",
      "\u201cThe defendants argue that the plaintiffs have not alleged irreparable harm because they are all currently receiving hormone medications. But it suffices to say that all three plaintiffs\u2019 access to hormone therapy is, as best the Court can tell, tenuous,\u201d Lamberth wrote.",
      "The plaintiffs are represented by attorneys from the Transgender Law Center and the American Civil Liberties Union.",
      "Lamberth, a senior judge, was nominated to the bench by President Ronald Reagan, a Republican, in 1987.",

      "LONDON -- The British government on Monday reversed its unpopular plan to end winter home heating subsidies for millions of retirees.",
      "British Prime Minister Keir Starmer had signaled the u-turn last month after a loud outcry from the public and some members of his Labour Party who thought the relatively modest 1.5 billion-pound ($2 billion) savings were too politically costly.",
      "Treasury chief Rachel Reeves, who canceled the payment for home heating on all but the poorest retirees after Labour came to power last summer, said the benefit would be restored to 9 million people, or three-quarters of pensioners, in England and Wales whose incomes are below 35,000 pounds ($47,500). Reeves said the move was necessary last year because the previous Conservative government had left public finances in a dire state.",
      "\u201cTargeting winter fuel payments was a tough decision, but the right decision because of the inheritance we had been left by the previous government,\" Reeves said. \u201cIt is also right that we continue to means-test this payment so that it is targeted and fair, rather than restoring eligibility to everyone including the wealthiest.\u201d",
      "The payments are worth between 200 and 300 pounds ($271 and $406) a year. The reversal will cost the government 1.25 billion, Reeve said.",
      "Canceling the payments for most people last winter was blamed for contributing to Starmer's swift decline in popularity after his party came to power in a landslide. He was blamed for punishing elderly people on limited incomes who struggled to make ends meet during a cost-of-living crisis.",

      "\u201cKeir Starmer has scrambled to clear up a mess of his own making,\" she said. \u201cThis humiliating u-turn will come as scant comfort to the pensioners forced to choose between heating and eating last winter. The prime minister should now apologize for his terrible judgment.\u201d",

      "The National Hurricane Center in Miami said Monday swells generated by the storm system will affect portions of the coast of southwestern Mexico during the next few days. These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.",
      "Hurricane Barbara was located about 155 miles (245 kilometers) southwest of Manzanillo, Mexico. Its maximum sustained winds were clocked at 75 mph (120 kph). The storm's center was moving northwest at 10 mph (17 kph).",
      "No coastal warnings or watches were in effect Monday morning. But the storm was expected to bring heavy rainfall to coastal areas of Guerrero, Michoacan, Colima and Jalisco states, with the possibility of localized flooding.",
      "The hurricane center said swells from Barbara were likely to form life-threatening surf and rip current conditions along the southwestern Mexican coast, with gusty winds likely.",

      "ROME -- Italians headed to the polls Monday on the second and final day of referendums that would make it easier for children born in Italy to foreigners to obtain citizenship, and on providing more job protections. But partial data showed a low turnout, well below the required 50% plus one threshold, risking to invalidate the vote.",
      "Campaigners for the change in the citizenship law say it will help second-generation Italians born in the country to non- European Union parents better integrate into a culture they already see as theirs.",
      "Partial data from Italy\u2019s Interior Ministry published at 2100 GMT on Sunday showed that national turnout stood at 22.7%, just over half of the 41% registered at the same time of the day in the latest comparable referendum held in 2011. The polling stations close later Monday at 1300 GMT.",

      "In May, Italy\u2019s AGCOM communications authority lodged a complaint against RAI state television and other broadcasters over a lack of adequate and balanced coverage.",
      "Opinion polls published in mid-May showed that only 46% of Italians were aware of the issues driving the referendums.

      "KIBERA, Kenya -- Dotting the roadside in what is widely considered Africa\u2019s largest urban slum are typical stands selling vegetables. What isn't typical is their acceptance of bitcoin as a form of payment.",
      "Around 200 people use bitcoin in Soweto West, a neighborhood of the Kibera slum in Kenya 's capital. It's part of an initiative to extend financial services to one of the country's poorest and most under-banked areas.",
      "Its promoters say the adoption of crypto fits with the ideals of bitcoin as an accessible, democratic technology \u2014 but experts say it also has major risks.",
      "Bitcoin came to Soweto West via AfriBit Africa, a Kenyan fintech company, through its nonprofit initiative to improve financial inclusion.",
      "\u201cIn many cases, people in Kibera do not have an opportunity to secure their lives with normal savings,\u201d said AfriBit Africa co-founder Ronnie Mdawida, a former community worker. With bitcoin, \"they do not need documentation to have a bank account \u2026 that gives them the foundation for financial freedom.\u201d",
      "Bitcoin, the first and largest crypto, was created in 2009 in the wake of the global financial crisis as a decentralized digital asset that could act as an alternative method of payment.",
      "The asset has found more popular use as a store of value, like a digital form of gold. Bitcoin has attracted enthusiastic supporters as prices have climbed almost 1,000% in the last five years. But its volatility and lack of regulation are concerns.",
      "AfriBit Africa introduced bitcoin into Soweto West in early 2022 through crypto-denominated grants to local garbage collectors, who are often funded by nonprofits. The groups are made up of dozens of young people, who Mdawida says are more likely to be open to new tech.",
      "After gathering on a Sunday to collect trash, garbage collectors are paid a few dollars' worth of bitcoin. AfriBit Africa estimates that it has put some $10,000 into the community, with garbage collectors acting as the main agents of spreading bitcoin in Soweto West. In Kibera, many people earn about a dollar a day.",
      "Now a small number of other residents hold bitcoin, and some merchants and motorcycle taxis accept payments in crypto.",
      "Damiano Magak, 23, a garbage collector and food seller, said he prefers bitcoin to M-PESA, the ubiquitous mobile money platform in Kenya, because M-PESA transaction costs are higher and the network can be slower.",
      "There are no fees for M-PESA transactions between individuals or businesses up to 100 Kenyan shillings (78 cents), but after that the fees increase with transaction size. Fees for the Lightning bitcoin network where transactions take place are free if people use a platform that AfriBit Africa introduced into the community.",
      "Onesmus Many, 30, another garbage collector, said he feels safer with his money in a bitcoin wallet instead of in cash because of crime.",
      "Some merchants have found benefits to accepting crypto, including Dotea Anyim. She said around 10% of customers at her vegetable stand pay in bitcoin.",
      "\u201cI like it because it is cheap and fast and doesn\u2019t have any transaction costs,\u201d she says. \u201cWhen people pay using bitcoin, I save that money and use cash to restock vegetables.\u201d",
      "The possibility that crypto prices could keep rising also appeals to residents of Soweto West. Magak and Many said they now have around 70% to 80% of their net worth in bitcoin, a far higher level of exposure than most people.",
      "\u201cIt is my worth and I\u2019m risking it in bitcoin,\u201d Magak said.",
      "That concerns Ali Hussein Kassim, a fintech entrepreneur and chair of the FinTech Alliance in Kenya.",
      "\u201cIn an extremely volatile asset like bitcoin, it\u2019s overexposure. I can\u2019t afford to lose 80% of my wealth. How about a guy in Kibera?\u201d Kassim said. \u201cYou are exposing a vulnerable community to an ecosystem and to financial services that they can\u2019t necessarily afford to play in.\u201d",
      "Kassim acknowledged the potential benefits that digital assets could bring, particularly in facilitating cheaper cross-border payments like remittances, but failed to see the benefit in Kibera.",
      "Bitcoin\u2019s volatility could negate the benefits of cheaper transaction fees, Kassim said, and bitcoin does not have the same protections as other financial services due to a lack of regulation.",
      "Mdawida disagreed, calling bitcoin\u2019s unregulated nature a benefit.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t shy away from the risks involved,\u201d the AfriBit Africa co-founder said, noting the group\u2019s investments in bitcoin education in Kibera, including financial literacy training and crypto courses in the community.",
      "Efforts to introduce bitcoin into developing countries have faced challenges. Bitcoin was adopted as legal tender in El Salvador and Central African Republic but both countries have reversed their decision.",
      "In Kenya, the digital asset sector has faced legal and regulatory challenges, including crackdowns on cryptocurrency giveaways. This small project, focusing only on Soweto West, has been allowed.",
      "\u201cOn my phone I put notifications on when bitcoin rises \u2026 and it\u2019s all smiles,\" Magak said. \"Whenever it fluctuates up and down, I know at the end of the day it will just rise.\u201d",

      "NICE, France -- The third U.N. Ocean Conference opens Monday as pressure mounts for nations to turn decades of promises into real protection for the sea.",
      "The summit comes as just 2.7% of the ocean is effectively protected from destructive extractive activities, according to the nonprofit Marine Conservation Institute. That's far below the target agreed under the \u201c30x30\u201d pledge to conserve 30% of land and sea by 2030.",
      "Atop this year\u2019s agenda is ratification of the High Seas Treaty. Adopted in 2023, the treaty would for the first time allow nations to establish marine protected areas in international waters, which cover nearly two-thirds of the ocean and are largely ungoverned.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the Wild West out there with countries just fishing anywhere without any sort of regulation, and that needs to change,\u201d said Mauro Randone, regional projects manager at the World Wildlife Fund\u2019s Mediterranean Marine Initiative. \u201cThe high seas belong to everyone and no one practically at the same time, and countries are finally committing to establish some rules.\u201d",
      "The ocean is critical in stabilizing Earth\u2019s climate and sustaining life. It generates 50% of the oxygen we breathe, absorbs around 30% of carbon dioxide emissions and captures more than 90% of the excess heat caused by those emissions. Without a healthy ocean, experts warn, climate goals will remain out of reach.",
      "The treaty will only come into force once 60 countries ratify it. As of Monday, just 32 countries had. Advocates hope UNOC can build enough momentum to cross the threshold, which would allow for the first official Oceans Conference of Parties.",
      "\u201cTwo-thirds of the ocean is areas beyond national jurisdiction \u2014 that\u2019s half our planet,\u201d said Minna Epps, director of global ocean policy the International Union for Conservation of Nature. \u201cWe cannot possibly protect 30% of the ocean if it doesn\u2019t include the high seas.\u201d",
      "South Korea, France and the European Union have championed the treaty, but most large ocean nations have yet to ratify it, including the rest of the G20. Thousands of attendees are expected in Nice \u2014 from delegates and heads of state to scientists and industry leaders. The United States has yet to confirm a formal delegation.",
      "Beyond new commitments, the conference highlights the growing gap between marine protection declarations and real-world conservation.",
      "France, the conference co-host, claims to have surpassed the 30% target for marine protection. But environmental groups say only 3% of French waters are fully protected from harmful activities like bottom trawling and industrial fishing.",
      "In 2024 alone, more than 100 bottom-trawling vessels were recorded spending over 17,000 hours fishing within France\u2019s six marine nature parks, according to ocean advocacy group Oceana.",
      "\u201cThe government declares these as protected areas, but this is a lie,\u201d said Enric Sala, founder of National Geographic Pristine Seas marine reserve project. \u201cMost of it is political box-ticking. It\u2019s all paper parks.\u201d",
      "That criticism is echoed across the continent. A new World Wildlife Fund report found that although more than 11% of Europe\u2019s marine area is designated for protection, just 2% of EU waters have management plans in place.",
      "Fabien Boileau, director of marine protected areas at France\u2019s Office for Biodiversity, acknowledged the presence of bottom trawling in French protected areas, but said it was part of a phased strategy.",
      "\u201cIn France, we made the choice to designate large marine protected areas with relatively low levels of regulation at first, betting that stronger protections would be developed over time through local governance,\u201d he said. \u201cToday, we\u2019re gradually increasing the number of zones with stricter protections within those areas.\u201d",
      "While many marine protected areas struggle with enforcement, others show what real protection can achieve. Off the southern coast of France, Port-Cros National Park is one of the oldest marine reserves in the Mediterranean. There, strict anchoring bans have allowed vast seagrass meadows to grow undisturbed. Massive groupers patrol rocky outcrops, brightly colored nudibranchs munch on algae, and schools of large corbs glide through the shallows, undisturbed by fishing lines.",
      "\u201cThanks to the protections that have been in place since 1963, we can observe species that are much larger than elsewhere in the Mediterranean and at a much higher density than in other areas,\" said Hubert Flavigny, manager of Mio Palmo dive center in Hyeres, France.",
      "Still, such examples remain exceptions.",
      "Advocates say industrial fishing lobbies continue to resist stricter protections, despite evidence that well-managed reserves boost long-term fisheries through the \u201cspillover effect,\u201d whereby marine life flourishes in nearby waters.",
      "\u201cProtection is not the problem \u2014 overfishing is the problem,\u201d said Sala. \u201cThe worst enemy of the fishing industry is themselves.\u201d",
      "Frustrated by government inaction, environmental groups have taken enforcement into their own hands. In May, Greenpeace dropped 15 limestone boulders into France\u2019s Golfe du Lion, aiming to physically block bottom trawling in a marine area that has long been designated for protection. The protected zone was established in 2008 to preserve deep-sea ecosystems, yet 12 trawlers continue to operate there, despite scientific warnings of ecological collapse, according to activist group MedReAct. The Golfe is now one of the most overfished areas in the Mediterranean.",
      "The conference will feature 10 panels on topics such as blue finance, sustainable fisheries and plastic pollution. Deep sea mining is expected to feature in broader discussions, while small island states are likely to use the platform to advocate for increased climate adaptation funding. The outcome of these discussions will form the basis of the Nice Ocean Action Plan \u2014 a declaration of voluntary commitments to be adopted by consensus and presented at the United Nations in New York this July.",
      "\"There cannot be a healthy planet without a healthy ocean,\" said Peter Thomson, U.N. special envoy for the ocean. \u201cIt\u2019s urgent business for us all.\u201d ___",

      "JERUSALEM -- Israeli forces seized a Gaza-bound aid boat and detained Greta Thunberg and other activists who were on board early Monday, enforcing a longstanding blockade of the Palestinian territory that has been tightened during the war with Hamas.",
      "The activists had set out to protest Israel's ongoing military campaign in the Gaza Strip, which is among the deadliest and most destructive since World War II, and its restrictions on the entry of humanitarian aid, both of which have put the territory of some 2 million Palestinians at risk of famine.",
      "The Freedom Flotilla Coalition, which had organized the voyage, said the activists were \u201ckidnapped by Israeli forces\u201d while trying to deliver desperately needed aid to the territory.",
      "\u201cThe ship was unlawfully boarded, its unarmed civilian crew abducted, and its life-saving cargo \u2014 including baby formula, food and medical supplies \u2014 confiscated,\u201d it said in a statement. It said the ship was seized in international waters some 200 kilometers (120 miles) from Gaza.",
      "Israel's Foreign Ministry portrayed the voyage as a public relations stunt, saying in a post on X that \"the \u2018selfie yacht\u2019 of the \u2018celebrities\u2019 is safely making its way to the shores of Israel.\u201d",
      "It said the activists would return to their home countries and the aid would be sent to Gaza through established channels. It circulated footage of what appeared to be Israeli military personnel handing out sandwiches and water to the activists, who were wearing orange life vests.",
      "Lt. Col. Nadav Shoshani, an Israeli military spokesperson, said the ship was still en route to Israel around midday Monday. It was expected to dock at the port of Ashdod.",
      "Thunberg, a climate campaigner, was among 12 activists aboard the Madleen, which set sail from Sicily a week ago. Along the way, it had stopped on Thursday to rescue four migrants who had jumped overboard to avoid being detained by the Libyan coast guard.",
      "\u201cI urge all my friends, family and comrades to put pressure on the Swedish government to release me and the others as soon as possible,\" Thunberg said in a pre-recorded message released after the ship was halted.",
      "Rima Hassan, a French member of the European Parliament who is of Palestinian descent, was also among the volunteers on board. She has been barred from entering Israel because of her opposition to Israeli policies toward the Palestinians.",
      "She was among six French citizens aboard the boat. French President Emmanuel Macron asked Israel to allow them to return to France as soon as possible, his office said in a statement.",
      "Adalah, a rights group in Israel that said it was representing the activists, said Israel had \u201cno legal authority\u201d to take over the ship because it was in international waters and because it was headed not to Israel but to the \u201cterritorial waters of the state of Palestine.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe arrest of the unarmed activists, who operated in a civilian manner to provide humanitarian aid, amounts to a serious breach of international law,\u201d Adalah said in a statement.",
      "After a 2\u00bd-month total blockade aimed at pressuring Hamas, Israel started allowing some basic aid into Gaza last month, but humanitarian workers and experts have warned of famine unless the blockade is lifted and Israel ends its military offensive.",
      "An attempt last month by Freedom Flotilla to reach Gaza by sea failed after another of the group\u2019s vessels was attacked by two drones while sailing in international waters off Malta, organizers said. The group blamed Israel for the attack, which damaged the front section of the ship.",
      "Israel and Egypt have imposed varying degrees of blockade on Gaza since Hamas seized power from rival Palestinian forces in 2007. Israel says the blockade is needed to prevent Hamas from importing arms, while critics say it amounts to collective punishment of Gaza's Palestinian population.",
      "Israel sealed Gaza off from all aid in the early days of the war ignited by the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, but later relented under U.S. pressure. In early March, shortly before Israel ended a ceasefire with Hamas, the country again blocked all imports, including food, fuel and medicine.",
      "Hamas-led militants killed around 1,200 people, mostly civilians, in the Oct. 7 attack and abducted 251 hostages, most of whom have since been released in ceasefire agreements or other deals. Hamas is still holding 55 hostages, more than half of them believed to be dead.",
      "Israel\u2019s military campaign has killed more than 54,000 Palestinians, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, which doesn't distinguish between civilians and combatants but has said women and children make up most of the dead.",
      "The war has destroyed vast areas of Gaza and displaced around 90% of the territory\u2019s population, leaving people there almost completely dependent on international aid.",
      "Efforts to broker another truce have been deadlocked for months. Hamas says it will only release the remaining hostages in exchange for a lasting ceasefire and an Israeli withdrawal, while Israel has vowed to continue the war until all the captives are returned and Hamas is defeated or disarmed and exiled.",

      "Russian officials say that Moscow is still awaiting confirmation from Kyiv on a planned exchange of 6,000 bodies of soldiers killed in action and is accusing Ukraine of delaying the process",
      "Russian officials said Sunday that Moscow is still awaiting official confirmation from Kyiv that a planned exchange of 6,000 bodies of soldiers killed in action will take place, reiterating allegations that Ukraine had postponed the swap.",
      "Russian state media quoted Lt. Gen. Alexander Zorin, a representative of the Russian negotiating group, as saying that Russia delivered the first batch of 1,212 bodies of Ukrainian Armed Forces soldiers to the exchange site at the border and is waiting for confirmation from the Ukrainian side, but that there are \u201csignals\u201d that the process of transferring the bodies will be postponed until next week.",
      "Russia and Ukraine each accused the other on Saturday of endangering plans to swap 6,000 bodies of soldiers killed in action, which was agreed upon during direct talks in Istanbul on Monday that otherwise made no progress toward ending the war.",
      "Vladimir Medinsky, a Putin aide who led the Russian delegation, said that Kyiv called a last-minute halt to an imminent swap. In a Telegram post on Saturday, Medinsky said that refrigerated trucks carrying more than 1,200 bodies of Ukrainian troops from Russia had already reached the agreed exchange site at the border when the news came.",
      "In response, Ukraine said Russia was playing \u201cdirty games\u201d and manipulating facts.",
      "According to the main Ukrainian authority dealing with such swaps, no date had been set for repatriating the bodies. In a statement on Saturday, the agency also accused Russia of submitting lists of prisoners of war for repatriation that didn\u2019t correspond to agreements reached on Monday.",
      "It wasn\u2019t immediately possible to reconcile the conflicting claims.",
      "In other developments, one person was killed and another seriously wounded in Russian aerial strikes on the eastern Ukrainian Kharkiv region. These strikes came after Russian attacks targeting the regional capital, also called Kharkiv, killed at least four people and wounded more than two dozen others on Saturday.",
      "Russia fired a total of 49 exploding drones and decoys and three missiles overnight, Ukraine\u2019s air force said Sunday. Forty drones were shot down or electronically jammed.",
      "Meanwhile, Russia\u2019s defense ministry said that its forces shot down 61 Ukrainian drones overnight, including near the capital.",
      "Two people were wounded when a Ukrainian drone attack sparked a fire at a chemical plant in the Tula region.",

      "LONDON -- Authorities in the second-largest city in Kyrgyzstan, Osh, have removed a towering statue of Vladimir Lenin thought to be the tallest of the revolutionary Soviet leader in Central Asia.",
      "The 23-meter (75-foot) monument was erected in 1975 when Kyrgyzstan was part of the Soviet Union. Photos appeared online Saturday showing the statue flat on the ground after being lowered by a crane.",
      "While many countries formerly part of the Soviet Union have moved to downplay their ties to Russia as part of efforts to reshape national identity, the monument was taken down with little public fanfare and officials in Osh framed the removal as routine city planning.",

      "The monument, they said, will be replaced by a flagpole, as was the case when a different Lenin statue was relocated in the capital, Bishkek.",
      "The move came a week after Kyrgyzstan\u2019s ally Russia unveiled a monument to brutal Soviet dictator Josef Stalin at one of Moscow\u2019s busiest subway stations.",

      "Iranian rapper Tataloo, a face-tattooed star who once supported a hard-line Iranian presidential candidate, now awaits execution",
      "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- The tattoos covering Iranian rapper Tataloo's face stand out against the gray prison uniform the 37-year-old now wears as he awaits execution, his own rise and fall tracing the chaos of the last decade of Iranian politics.",
      "Tataloo, whose full name is Amir Hossein Maghsoudloo, faces a death sentence after being convicted on charges of \u201cinsulting Islamic sanctities.\u201d It's a far cry from when he once supported a hard-line Iranian presidential candidate.",
      "Tataloo's music became popular among the Islamic Republic's youth, as it challenged Iran's theocracy at a time when opposition to the country's government was splintered and largely leaderless.",
      "The rapper's lyrics became increasingly political after the 2022 death of Mahsa Amini and the subsequent wave of nationwide protests. He also appeared in music videos which criticized the authorities.",
      "\u201cWhen you show your face in a music video, you are saying, \u2018Hey, I\u2019m here, and I don\u2019t care about your restrictions,\u2019\u201d said Ali Hamedani, a former BBC journalist who interviewed the rapper in 2005. \u201cThat was brave.\u201d",
      "The Iranian Supreme Court last month upheld his death sentence.",
      "\u201cThis ruling has now been confirmed and is ready for execution,\u201d judiciary spokesman Asghar Jahangir told reporters at a press conference last month.",
      "Activists have decried his looming execution and expressed concern for his safety after he reportedly tried to kill himself in prison.",
      "Tataloo began his music career in 2003 as part of an underground genre of Iranian music that combines Western styles of rap, rhythm-and-blues and rock with Farsi lyrics. His first album, released in 2011, polarized audiences, though he never played publicly in Iran, where its Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance controls all concerts.",
      "Tataloo appeared in a 2015 music video backing Iran's paramilitary Revolutionary Guard and Tehran's nuclear program, which long has been targeted by the West over fears it could allow the Islamic Republic to develop an atomic bomb. While he never discussed the motivation behind this, it appeared that the rapper had hoped to win favor with the theocracy or perhaps have a travel ban against him lifted.",
      "In the video for \u201cEnergy Hasteei,\" or \u201cNuclear Energy,\u201d Tataloo sings a power ballad in front of rifle-wielding guardsmen and later aboard the Iranian frigate Damavand in the Caspian Sea. The ship later sank during a storm in 2018.",
      "\u201cThis is our absolute right: To have an armed Persian Gulf,\u201d Tataloo sang.",
      "Tataloo even issued an endorsement for hard-liner Ebrahim Raisi in 2017. That year, the two sat for a televised appearance as part of Raisi's failed presidential campaign against the relative moderate Hassan Rouhani. Raisi later won the presidency in 2021, but was killed in a helicopter crash in 2024.",
      "In 2018, Tataloo \u2014 who faced legal problems in Iran \u2014 was allowed to leave the country for Turkey, where many Persian singers and performers stage lucrative concerts.",
      "Tataloo hosted live video sessions as he rose to fame on social media, where he became well-known for his tattoos covering his face and body. Among them are an Iranian flag and an image of his mother next to a key and heart.",
      "Instagram deactivated his account in 2020 after he called for underage girls to join his \u201cteam\u201d for sex. He also acknowledged taking drugs.",
      "\u201cDespite being a controversial rapper, Tataloo has quite the fanbase in Iran, known as \u2018Tatalities,\u2019\u201d said Holly Dagres, a senior fellow at the Washington Institute for Near-East Policy. \u201cOver the years, they\u2019ve flooded social media with messages of solidarity for him and even campaigned for the rapper\u2019s release in the past when he was detained on separate charges.\u201d",
      "Tataloo\u2019s rebellious music struck a chord with disenfranchised young people in Iran as they struggled to find work, get married and start their adult lives. He also increasingly challenged Iran's theocracy in his lyrics, particularly after the death of Amini following her arrest over allegedly not wearing the hijab to the liking of authorities.",
      "His collaboration \u201cEnghelab Solh\" \u2014 \u201cPeace Revolution\u201d in Farsi \u2014 called out Iran\u2019s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei by name.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t want tear gas, because there are tears in everyone\u2019s eyes,\u201d he rapped.",
      "But the music stopped for Tataloo in late 2023. He was deported from Turkey after his passport had expired, and was immediately taken into custody upon arrival to Iran.",
      "Tehran\u2019s Criminal Court initially handed Tataloo a five-year sentence for blasphemy. Iran\u2019s Supreme Court threw out the decision and sent his case to another court, which sentenced him to death in January. The rapper already faced ten years in prison for a string of separate convictions, including promoting prostitution and moral corruption.",
      "\u201cTataloo is at serious risk of execution,\u201d Mahmood Amiry-Moghaddam, the director of advocacy group Iran Human Rights, said in a statement. \u201cThe international community, artists and the public must act to stop his execution.\u201d",
      "Tataloo earlier expressed remorse at a trial.",
      "\u201cI have certainly made mistakes, and many of my actions were wrong,\u201d he said, according to the state-owned Jam-e Jam daily newspaper. \u201cI apologize for the mistakes I made.\u201d",
      "Tataloo married while on death row, his uncle said. Last month, Tataloo reportedly attempted to kill himself, but survived.",
      "His death sentence comes at a politically fraught moment for Iran as the country is at it's \u201cmost isolated,\u201d said Abbas Milani, an Iran expert at Stanford University.",
      "The Islamic Republic is \u201cdesperately trying to see whether it can arrive at a deal with the U.S. on its nuclear program and have the sanctions lifted,\u201d he said. Drawing the ire of Tataloo\u2019s fans is \u201cone headache they don\u2019t need,\u201d he added.",

    "story": [
      "Sub-Saharan Africa has the world's highest school dropout rates and a driving factor is that parents are being crushed by unpredictable school fees",
      "KAMPALA, Uganda -- A crying parent with an unpaid tuition balance walked into the staff room of a Catholic private school and begged the teachers to help enroll her son.",
      "The school\u2019s policy required the woman pay at least 60% of her son\u2019s full tuition bill before he could join the student body. She didn\u2019t have the money and was led away.",
      "\u201cShe was pleading, \u2018Please help me,\u2019\u201d said Beatrice Akite, a teacher at St. Kizito Secondary School in Uganda\u2019s capital city, who witnessed the outburst. \u201cIt was very embarrassing. We had never seen something like that.\u201d",
      "Two weeks into second term, Akite recounted the woman\u2019s desperate moment to highlight how distressed parents are being crushed by unpredictable fees they can\u2019t pay, forcing their children to drop out of school. It\u2019s leaving many in sub-Saharan Africa \u2014 which has the world\u2019s highest dropout rates \u2014 to criticize the mission-driven Catholic Church for not doing enough to ease the financial pressure families face.",
      "The Catholic Church is the region\u2019s largest nongovernmental investor in education. Catholic schools have long been a pillar of affordable but high-quality education, especially for poor families.",
      "Their appeal remains strong even with competition from other nongovernmental investors now eying schools as enterprises for profit. The growing trend toward privatization is sparking concern that the Catholic Church may price out the people who need uplifting.",
      "Akite hopes Catholic leaders support measures that would streamline fees across schools of comparable quality. Firm fee ceilings need to be set, she said.",
      "Kampala's St. Kizito Secondary School, where Akite teaches literature, was founded by priests of the Comboni missionary order, known for its dedication to serving poor communities. Its students come mostly from working-class families and tuition per term is roughly $300, a substantial sum in a country where GDP per capita was about $1,000 in 2023.",
      "Yet that tuition is lower than at many other Catholic-run schools in Kampala, where many students report later in the term because they can\u2019t raise school fees in time, Akite said.",
      "One of the most expensive private schools in Kampala, the Catholic-run Uganda Martyrs\u2019 Secondary School Namugongo, maintains a policy of \u201czero balance\u201d when a child reports to school at the beginning of a three-month term. This means students must be fully paid by the time they report to school.",
      "Tuition at the school was once as high as $800 but has since dropped to about $600 as enrollment swelled to nearly 5,000, said deputy headmaster James Batte. On a recent morning, there was a queue of parents waiting outside Batte\u2019s office to request more time to clear tuition balances.",
      "Daniel Birungi, an electrical engineer in Kampala whose son enrolled this year at St. Mary\u2019s College Kisubi, a leading school for boys in Uganda, said the emerging risk for traditional Catholic schools is to cater only to the rich.",
      "There is hot water in the bathrooms, he said, describing what he felt was a trend toward levels of luxury he never imagined as a student there in the 1990s. Now, students are prohibited from packing snacks and instead encouraged to buy what they need from school-owned canteens, he said.",
      "That has \u201cput us under a lot of pressure,\u201d he said.",
      "Tuition at St. Mary\u2019s College Kisubi is roughly $800 per term, and Birungi doubts he will be able to regularly pay school fees on time. \u201cYou can go there and see the brother and negotiate,\u201d he said, referring to the headmaster. \u201cI am planning to go there and see him and ask for that consideration.\u201d",
      "The World Bank reported in 2023 that 54% of adults in sub-Saharan Africa rank the issue of paying school fees higher than medical bills and other expenses. That\u2019s partly because education is largely in private hands, with the most desirable schools controlled by profit-seeking owners.",
      "Schools run by the Catholic Church are not usually registered as profit-making entities, but those who run those schools say they wouldn\u2019t be competitive if they were run merely as charities. They say they face the same maintenance costs as others in the field and offer scholarships to exceptional students.",
      "Regulating tuition is not easy, said Ronald Reagan Okello, a priest who oversees education at the Catholic Secretariat in Kampala. He urges parents to send their children to schools they can afford.",
      "\u201cAs the Catholic Church, also we are competing with those who are in the private sector,\u201d said Okello, the national executive secretary for education with the Ugandan bishops conference. \u201cNow, as you are competing, the other ones are setting the bar high. They are giving you good services. But now putting the standard to that level, we are forced to raise the school fees to match the demands of the people who can afford.\u201d",
      "Across the region, the Catholic Church has built a reputation as a key provider of formal education in areas often underserved by the state. Its schools are cherished by families of all means for their values, discipline and academic success.",
      "In Zimbabwe, the Catholic Church operates about 100 schools, ranging from dozens in impoverished areas where annual tuition is as low as $150 to elite boarding schools that can charge thousands of dollars.",
      "But a legacy of inclusion is under pressure in the southern African nation due to fee increases at boarding schools and efforts by Catholic leaders to fully privatize some schools. Many boarding schools already charge tuition fees between $600 and $800, prohibitive for the working class in a country where most civil servants make less than a $300 per month.",
      "Privatization will raise tuition fees even higher, warned Peter Muzawazi, a prominent educator in Zimbabwe.",
      "Muzawazi, who attended Catholic schools, once was the headmaster of Marist Brothers, a top Catholic school for boys in Zimbabwe. That school in Nyanga is among those earmarked for privatization.",
      "\u201cI know in the Catholic Church there is a lot of space for reasonable fees for day scholars, but for boarders there is need to be watching because the possibility that they would be out of reach for the vulnerable is there,\u201d he said.",
      "The church needs to be actively engaged, he said. \u201cHow do we continue to guarantee education for the poor?\u201d",
      "Efforts to privatize church-founded schools have sparked debate in Zimbabwe, which for years has been in economic decline stemming in part from sanctions imposed by the U.S. and others. Authorities say privatizing these schools is necessary to maintain standards, even as critics warn Catholic leaders not to turn their backs on poor people.",
      "\u201cSchools have now turned into businesses,\u201d Martin Chaburumunda, president of the Zimbabwe Rural Teachers\u2019 Union, told The Manica Post, a state-run weekly. \u201cChurches now appear only hungry for money as opposed to educating the communities they operate in.\"",
      "Rather than privatizing old mission schools, the church should invest in building new ones if it\u2019s useful to experiment with different funding models, said Muzawazi, a lay Catholic who serves on the governing council of the Catholic University of Zimbabwe.",
      "\u201cThe bright people who advance the cause of countries are not the rich ones,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want every church and every nation to tap the potential of every person, regardless of economic status.\u201d",

      "ROME -- Italians vote over two days starting Sunday on referendums that would make it easier for children born in Italy to foreigners to obtain citizenship, and on providing more job protections. But apparent low public awareness risks rendering the vote invalid if turnout is not high enough.",
      "Campaigners for the change in the citizenship law say it will help second-generation Italians born in the country to non- European Union parents better integrate into a culture they already see as theirs.",
      "Italian singer Ghali, who was born in Milan to Tunisian parents, urged people to vote in an online post, noting that the referendum risks failure if at least 50% plus one of eligible voters don't turn out.",
      "\u201cI was born here, I always lived here, but I only received citizenship at the age of 18,\u2019\u2019 Ghali said, urging a yes vote to reduce the residency requirement from 10 to five years.",
      "The new rules, if passed, could affect about 2.5 million foreign nationals who still struggle to be recognized as citizens.",
      "The measures were proposed by Italy\u2019s main union and left-wing opposition parties. Premier Giorgia Meloni has said she would show up at the polls but not cast a ballot \u2014 an action widely criticized by the left as antidemocratic, since it will not help reach the necessary threshold to make the vote valid.",
      "\u201cWhile some members of her ruling coalition have openly called for abstention, Meloni has opted for a more subtle approach,\u201c said analyst Wolfango Piccoli of the Teneo consultancy based in London. \u201dIt\u2019s yet another example of her trademark fence-sitting.\u2019\u2019",
      "Supporters say this reform would bring Italy\u2019s citizenship law in line with many other European countries, promoting greater social integration for long-term residents. It would also allow faster access to civil and political rights, such as the right to vote, eligibility for public employment and freedom of movement within the EU.",
      "\u201cThe real drama is that neither people who will vote \u2018yes\u2019 nor those who intend to vote \u2018no\u2019 or abstain have an idea of what (an) ordeal children born from foreigners have to face in this country to obtain a residence permit,\u201d said Selam Tesfaye, an activist and campaigner with the Milan-based human rights group \u201cIl Cantiere.\u201d",
      "\u201cForeigners are also victims of blackmail, as they can\u2019t speak up against poor working conditions, exploitation and discrimination, due to the precariousness of the permit of stay,\u201d she added.",
      "Activists and opposition parties also denounced the lack of public debate on the measures, accusing the governing center-right coalition of trying to dampen interest in sensitive issues that directly impact immigrants and workers.",
      "In May, Italy\u2019s AGCOM communications authority lodged a complaint against RAI state television and other broadcasters for a lack of adequate and balanced coverage.",
      "\u201cThis referendum is really about dignity and the right to belong, which is key for many people who were born here and spent most of their adult life contributing to Italian society. For them, a lack of citizenship is like an invisible wall,\u201d said Michelle Ngonmo, a cultural entrepreneur and advocate for diversity in the fashion industry, who has lived most of her life in Italy after moving as a child from Cameroon.",
      "\u201cYou are good enough to work and pay taxes, but not to be fully recognized as Italian. This becomes a handicap for young generations, particularly in the creative field, creating frustration, exclusion and a big waste of potential,\u201d she said.",
      "The four other referendums aim to roll back labor reforms, making it harder to fire some workers and increase compensation for those laid off by small businesses, reversing a previous law passed by a center-left government a decade ago. One of the questions on the ballot also addresses the urgent issue of security at work, restoring joint liability to both contractors and subcontractors for workplace injuries.",
      "Opinion polls published in mid-May showed that only 46% of Italians were aware of the issues driving the referendums. Turnout projections were even weaker for a vote scheduled for the first weekend of Italy's school holidays, at around 35% of around 50 million electors, well below the required quorum.",
      "\u201cMany believe that the referendum institution should be reviewed in light of the high levels of abstention (that) emerged in recent elections and the turnout threshold should be lowered,\" said Lorenzo Pregliasco, political analyst and pollster at YouTrend.",
      "Some analysts note however that the center-left opposition could claim a victory even if the referendum fails on condition that the turnout surpasses the 12.3 million voters who backed the winning center-right coalition in the 2022 general election.",

      "Filipino villagers living in a fishing village on Thitu, which they call Pagasa island, immediately informed the Philippine military and coast guard after seeing the Chinese ship lying in the shallows about 1.5 nautical miles (2.7 kilometers) from their village, said MP Albayda, a local Filipino official, told The Associated Press.",
      "\u201cThey got worried because the Chinese were so close but it was really the strong wind and waves that caused the ship to run aground,\" said Albayda, adding that other Chinese ships pulled the stricken vessel away.",
      "The stricken ship resembled what the Philippine military had repeatedly said were suspected Chinese militia ships, which had backed the Chinese coast guard and navy in blocking and harassing Philippine coast guard and military vessels in the disputed waters, a busy conduit for global trade and commerce.",
      "Thitu Island is home to a Philippine fishing village and Filipino forces and is the largest of nine islands and islets occupied by the Philippines. It lies about 26 kilometers (16 miles) from Subi Reef, which China transformed into an island base along with six other barren reefs to reinforce its claim to virtually the entire South China Sea.",
      "Vietnam, Malaysia, Brunei and Taiwan are also involved in the long-simmering territorial standoffs, an Asian flashpoint that many fear could pit China and the United States in a major conflict.",
      "The U.S. does not lay any claim to the South China Sea but has repeatedly warned that it's obligated to defend the Philippines, it's longtime treaty ally, if Filipino forces, ships and aircraft come under an armed attack, including in the South China Sea.",

      "Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney says that Canada will meet NATO\u2019s military spending guideline by early next year",
      "TORONTO -- Canada will meet NATO's military spending guideline by early next year and diversify defense spending away from the United States, which he says no longer plays a predominant role on the world stage, Prime Minister Mark Carney said Monday.",
      "Carney said Canada will achieve NATO\u2019s spending target of 2% of gross domestic product five years earlier than it had previously planned.",
      "\u201cOur military infrastructure and equipment have aged, hindering our military preparedness,\" Carney said. \u201cOnly one of our four submarines is seaworthy. Less than half of our maritime fleet and land vehicles are operational. More broadly we are too reliant on the United States.\u201d",
      "According to NATO figures, Canada was estimated to be spending 1.33% of GDP on its military budget in 2023, below the 2% target that NATO countries have set for themselves. Canada previously said it was on track to meet NATO\u2019s spending target by the end of the decade.",
      "\u201cOur goal is to protect Canadians, not to satisfy NATO accountants,\u201d Carney said.",
      "The announcement of increased spending came as Canada is about to host U.S. President Donald Trump and other leaders at a summit of the Group of Seven leading industrialized nations in Alberta on June 15-17, and before the NATO summit in Europe. It also comes as NATO allies are poised to increase the commitment well beyond the 2% target.",
      "NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte said last week that most U.S. allies at NATO endorse Trump\u2019s demand that they invest 5% of gross domestic product on their defense needs and are ready to ramp up security spending even more.",
      "Carney has said that he intends to diversify Canada\u2019s procurement and enhance the country\u2019s relationship with the EU.",
      "\u201cWe should no longer send three quarters of our defense capital spending to America,\u201d Carney said in a speech at the University of Toronto. \u201cWe will invest in new submarines, aircraft, ships, armed vehicles and artillery, as well as new radar, drones and sensors to monitor the seafloor and the Arctic.\u201d",
      "Canada has been in discussions with the European Union to join an EU drive to break its security dependency on the United States, with a focus on buying more defense equipment, including fighter jets, in Europe. Carney\u2019s government is reviewing the purchase of U.S. F-35 fighter jets to see if there are other options.",
      "\u201cWe stood shoulder to shoulder with the Americans throughout the Cold War and in the decades that followed, as the United States played a predominant role on the world stage. Today, that predominance is a thing of the past,\u201d Carney said in French.",
      "He added that with the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, the United States became the global hegemon, noting its gravitational pull, always strong, became virtually irresistible and made the U.S. \u201cour closest ally and dominant trading partner.\u201d",
      "\u201cNow the United States is beginning to monetize its hegemony: charging for access to its markets and reducing its relative contributions to our collective security,\u201d Carney said.",
      "The prime minister said that \"a new imperialism threatens.\u201d",
      "\u201cMiddle powers compete for interests and attention, knowing that if they are not at the table, they will be on the menu,\" Carney said.",
      "Trump\u2019s calls to make Canada the 51st U.S. state have infuriated Canadians, and Carney won the job of prime minister after promising to confront the increased aggression shown by Trump.",
      "Carney said that the long-held view that Canada\u2019s geographic location will protect Canadians is becoming increasingly archaic.",
      "European allies and Canada have already been investing heavily in their armed forces, as well as on weapons and ammunition, since Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022.",

      "The British government say it is reversing its unpopular plan to end winter home heating subsidies for millions of retirees",
      "LONDON -- The British government on Monday reversed its unpopular plan to end winter home heating subsidies for millions of retirees.",
      "British Prime Minister Keir Starmer had signaled the u-turn last month after a loud outcry from the public and some members of his Labour Party who thought the relatively modest 1.5 billion-pound ($2 billion) savings were too politically costly.",
      "Treasury chief Rachel Reeves, who canceled the payment for home heating on all but the poorest retirees after Labour came to power last summer, said the benefit would be restored to 9 million people, or three-quarters of pensioners, in England and Wales whose incomes are below 35,000 pounds ($47,500). Reeves said the move was necessary last year because the previous Conservative government had left public finances in a dire state.",
      "\u201cTargeting winter fuel payments was a tough decision, but the right decision because of the inheritance we had been left by the previous government,\" Reeves said. \u201cIt is also right that we continue to means-test this payment so that it is targeted and fair, rather than restoring eligibility to everyone including the wealthiest.\u201d",
      "The payments are worth between 200 and 300 pounds ($271 and $406) a year. The reversal will cost the government 1.25 billion, Reeve said.",
      "Canceling the payments for most people last winter was blamed for contributing to Starmer's swift decline in popularity after his party came to power in a landslide. He was blamed for punishing elderly people on limited incomes who struggled to make ends meet during a cost-of-living crisis.",
      "Labour fared poorly in local elections in England last month, with many party representatives blaming the removal of the winter fuel payment.",
      "Kemi Badenoch, leader of the main opposition Conservative Party, quickly pounced on Starmer's about-face.",
      "\u201cKeir Starmer has scrambled to clear up a mess of his own making,\" she said. \u201cThis humiliating u-turn will come as scant comfort to the pensioners forced to choose between heating and eating last winter. The prime minister should now apologize for his terrible judgment.\u201d",

      "The crypto industry is seeing growing support from the Democratic Party, though it's far from unanimous",
      "WASHINGTON -- As President Donald Trump builds a crypto empire \u2014 including hosting a private dinner with top investors at his golf club \u2014 Democrats have united in condemning what they call blatant corruption from the White House.",
      "But the Democratic Party\u2019s own relationship with the emerging crypto industry is far less cut and dried.",
      "Work in the Republican-led Senate to legitimize cryptocurrency by adding guardrails has drawn backing from some Democrats, underscoring growing support for the industry in the party. But divisions have opened over the bill, with many demanding it prevent the Republican president and his family from directly profiting from cryptocurrency.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m all on board with the idea of regulating crypto,\u201d said Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn. \u201cBut at this moment, when cryptocurrency is being so clearly used by Donald Trump to facilitate his corruption, I don\u2019t think you can close your eyes to that when you\u2019re legislating.\u201d",
      "The legislation is moving ahead more rapidly than Congress usually acts when an industry is new. But the big money and campaign donations flowing from cryptocurrency firms have made them a new powerhouse on the political scene, one that's increasingly gaining allies and capturing the attention of lawmakers.",
      "A look at what to know about the industry's clout and the political fight over what's known as the GENIUS Act:",
      "To understand the growing clout of the crypto industry, look no further than the 2024 election. Fairshake, a crypto super political action committee, and its affiliated PACs spent more than $130 million in congressional races.",
      "Fairshake spent roughly $40 million supporting Republican Bernie Moreno in Ohio in an effort to defeat Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown. Brown, who lost to Moreno by more than 3 percentage points, was seen as a chief critic of the industry as the chairman of the Senate Banking Committee.",
      "\u201cDC received a clear message that being anti-crypto is a good way to end your career, as it doesn\u2019t represent the will of the voters,\u201d Brian Armstrong, the CEO of Coinbase, wrote in a social media post the day after the 2024 election.",
      "Coinbase \u2014 the largest crypto exchange in the U.S. and biggest contributor to Fairshake \u2014 does not view support for its industry as partisan, according to Kara Calvert, the company's vice president of U.S. policy. The industry also spent heavily to support Democrats Ruben Gallego and Elissa Slotkin in their races for open Senate seats in battleground states.",
      "Fairshake spent $10 million in support of Slotkin during her successful Senate run against Republican Mike Rodgers, and Slotkin, who won the Michigan race by fewer than 20,000 votes, spoke in favor of crypto on the campaign trail. Slotkin declined to be interviewed.",
      "Similar dynamics are setting up ahead of 2026 in contested House and Senate races. Fairshake said in January that it already had $116 million in cash on hand aimed at the 2026 midterm elections.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re not slowing down, and everything remains on the table,\u201d Josh Vlasto, a spokesperson for Fairshake, told The Associated Press.",
      "Hours before a May 19 vote to move forward on cryptocurrency legislation in the Senate, an advocacy group tied to Coinbase sent an email to the offices of U.S. senators warning that the vote would count toward their crypto-friendliness scores.",
      "\u201cWhat the spending does is put crypto on the map. It lets members know that this is not a phase, this is real industry, with real dollars, that is developing its hold in Washington,\u201d said Calvert.",
      "A significant number of Democrats, 16, joined Republicans in advancing the crypto legislation. The GENIUS Act would create a new regulatory structure for stablecoins, a type of cryptocurrency typically pegged to the U.S. dollar. It is viewed as a step toward consumer protections and greater legitimacy for the industry.",
      "The sticking point for many Democrats is that while the bill prohibits members of Congress and their families from profiting off stablecoins, it excludes the president from those restrictions.",
      "Trump, once a skeptic of the industry, has vowed in his second term to make the U.S. the global capital of crypto. Meanwhile, he and his family have moved aggressively into nearly every corner of the industry: mining operations, billion-dollar bitcoin purchases, a newly minted stablecoin and a Trump-branded meme coin.",
      "Days after Trump\u2019s interests in the industry became public in early May, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York urged the Democratic caucus to unite and vote against the package to have a stronger hand in negotiations, according to a person familiar with the matter who insisted on anonymity to discuss private discussions.",
      "On May 8, a bloc of Senate Democrats who had previously backed the GENIUS Act reversed course \u2014 ultimately voting to block the bill from advancing. Negotiations between Senate Democrats and Republicans followed. The White House was also involved, and in contact with senators' offices on both sides of the aisle, according to a senior official granted anonymity to discuss private conversations.",
      "The new version of the bill is now expected to pass the 100-member Senate this month. Amendments are still possible. Sen. Jeff Merkley, D-Ore. has filed an amendment \u2014 cosponsored by Schumer \u2014 that would bar the president and his family from profiting off stablecoins, though it\u2019s unlikely to pass.",
      "\u201cThere is room for improvements as there often is with a lot of legislation. But with this in particular, we\u2019ve got issues with the president,\u201d said Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona \u201cHaving said that, this was negotiated with Democrats and Republicans. We got to a place. We voted on it. I expect this is the version we\u2019re going to pass.\u201d",
      "Still, the legislation is stirring unease. Schumer, asked if he\u2019s urging members to vote against the bill, noted that he has opposed the legislation and said \u201cthere\u2019s division in our caucus on that issue.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a gaping hole in this bill that everybody sees,\" Murphy said. \"After it\u2019s passed, it will be illegal for me to issue a cryptocurrency, but it\u2019s legal for the president of the United States.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf this bill passes, we kind of go from a dirt road to a paved road,\u201d he said.",
      "If the Senate approves the stablecoin legislation, the bill will still need to clear the House before reaching the president\u2019s desk.",
      "Crypto advocates say the next priority is pushing Congress for market structure legislation, a far more sweeping effort than simply regulating stablecoins.",
      "\u201cStablecoin is one step of the path. Then you need market structure. We're hopeful that the Senate works together to pass something quickly,\u201d Calvert said.",
      "Some Democrats view the legislation as a chance to impose basic guardrails on a rapidly growing industry that's particularly popular among men and younger voters, two groups that drifted from the party in 2024.",

      "WASHINGTON -- The Senate has set an ambitious timeline for passing President Donald Trump\u2019s sweeping legislation to cut taxes and spending. But getting it on the Republican president's desk by July 4 will require some big decisions, and soon.",
      "Republican senators are airing concerns about different parts of the legislation, including cuts to Medicaid, changes to food aid and the impact on the deficit. To push the bill to passage, Senate Majority Leader John Thune of South Dakota and other negotiators will need to find a compromise that satisfies both ends of their conference \u2014 and that can still satisfy the House, which passed the bill last month by only one vote.",
      "A look at some of the groups and senators who leaders will have to convince as they work to push Trump\u2019s \u201cbig, beautiful\u201d bill toward a Senate vote:",
      "Every Republican senator represents a state with a rural constituency \u2014 and some of their states are among the most rural in the country. Many in those less-populated areas rely heavily on Medicaid for health care, leading several of them to warn that the changes to the program in the bill could be devastating to communities that are already struggling.",
      "Of particular concern is a freeze on a so-called provider tax that some states use to help pay for large portions of their Medicaid programs. The extra tax often leads to higher payments from the federal government, which critics say is a loophole that allows states to inflate their budgets. Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri and several others have argued that freezing that tax revenue would hurt rural hospitals, in particular.",
      "\u201cHospitals will close,\u201d Hawley said last month. \u201cIt\u2019s that simple. And that pattern will replicate in states across the country.\u201d",
      "Alabama Sen. Tommy Tuberville said Thursday that provider taxes in his state are \u201cthe money we use for Medicaid.\u201d",
      "\u201cYou start cutting that out, we\u2019ve got big problems,\u201d Tuberville said. Eliminating those taxes \u201cmight lose some folks.\u201d",
      "At the same time, Republican senators have little interest in a House-passed provision that spends more money by raising a cap on state and local tax deductions, known as SALT. The higher cap traditionally benefits more urban areas in states with high taxes, such as New York and California.",
      "The House included the new cap after New York Republicans threatened to oppose the bill, but Senate Republicans uniformly dislike it. \u201cI think there\u2019s going to have to be some adjustment\u201d on the SALT provision, Thune said Wednesday, noting that \u201csenators are just in a very different place\u201d from the House.",
      "The House-passed bill would also shift some Medicaid and food stamp costs to states, a change that has the former governors in the Senate, in particular, worried.",
      "West Virginia Sen. Jim Justice, who was governor of his state for eight years before his election to the Senate last year, said he favors many aspects of the bill. He supports the new work requirements for Medicaid and food stamp recipients, the restrictions on benefits for immigrants who are in the country illegally and the efforts to cut down on fraud. \u201cThere\u2019s real savings there,\u201d Justice said. \u201cBut then we ought to stop.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re on our way to cannibalizing ourselves,\u201d Justice said. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to hurt kids and hurt our families.\u201d",
      "The provision stirring the most unease would shift 5% of administrative costs to the state for administering food stamps \u2014 known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP. States that have high error rates in the program would have to take on an even higher percentage of federal costs.",
      "North Dakota Sen. John Hoeven, also a former governor, said senators are working to get feedback from current governors and may propose some \u201cincentive-oriented ideas\u201d instead of a penalty for the high error rates.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t know if the states have really looked at the impacts of some of this yet,\u201d Hoeven said.",
      "Tuberville, who is running for governor of Alabama next year, said the program should be reformed instead of shifting costs.",
      "\u201cI know what our budget is and what we can afford, and we can\u2019t start a federal program and then say, \u2018Oh, let\u2019s, let\u2019s send it back to the states and let them take a big hunk of it,\u2019\u201d Tuberville said. \u201cI mean, that\u2019s not the way we do it.\u201d",
      "Thune needs to bring Republican moderates on board with the bill, including Maine Sen. Susan Collins and Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski. Both have reservations with the Medicaid cuts, among other things.",
      "Collins said she wants to review how the SNAP changes will affect her state. Murkowski has questioned expiring subsidies for the Affordable Care Act and whether they might be needed if people are kicked off Medicaid.",
      "Last month, Murkowski said she wants to make sure that people are not negatively impacted by the bill, \u201cso we\u2019re looking at it through that lens for both Medicaid and on energy.\u201d",
      "Murkowski and Sens. Thom Tillis of North Carolina, John Curtis of Utah and Jerry Moran of Kansas have also supported energy tax credits that would be phased out quickly under the House bill. The four senators argued that the quick repeal creates uncertainty for businesses and could raise prices for consumers.",
      "Sens. Rand Paul of Kentucky, Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, Mike Lee of Utah and Rick Scott of Florida have argued the legislation does not save enough money and threatened to vote against it.",
      "Paul is considered the least likely to support the measure. He says he won\u2019t vote for it if it raises the debt ceiling \u2014 a key priority for GOP leaders in both the House and the Senate. The package would raise the nation\u2019s debt limit by $4 trillion to allow more borrowing to pay the nation's bills, as the Treasury Department says the limit needs to be raised by the middle of July.",
      "Johnson has been railing against the legislation since it was unveiled in the House, arguing that it does little to reduce government spending over time. He took those arguments to Trump last week at a meeting between the president and members of the Senate Finance Committee.",
      "After the meeting, Johnson said he would continue to argue that the bill needs to do more to cut costs. But he said he came away with the recognition that he needed to be \u201cmore positive\u201d as Trump exerts political pressure on Republicans to pass it.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re a long ways from making the deficit curve bend down, but I recognize that\u2019s going to take time,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cThe truth is, there are a lot of good things in this bill that I absolutely support. I want it to succeed.\u201d",

      "The changes at Majid Al Futtaim come as Dubai tries to guide the family-run businesses that powered the city-state's growth in the United Arab Emirates through generational change. Authorities also likely want to avoid any further infighting that could slow down the growth of a firm that long has made hiring Emiratis a key goal.",
      "The Financial Times first reported on the changes to Majid Al Futtaim's board, saying it came at the orders of a government-established special judicial committee.",
      "In 2022, Dubai\u2019s ruler, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, established a special judicial committee to look after the estate of Majid Al Futtaim's founder \u2014 also named Majid Al Futtaim \u2014 following his death in 2021.",
      "Responding to questions Monday from The Associated Press, the company appeared to acknowledge the changes at Majid Al Futtaim Capital, which oversees its group of companies.",
      "The changes \u201creflect a shareholder-led effort to evolve governance in line with the long-term interests of the Group,\u201d the company said in a statement. \u201cThese changes do not affect the operations or governance of Majid Al Futtaim Holding. Majid Al Futtaim continues to operate under an independent board and strong oversight.\u201d",
      "Dubai's government did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "The Financial Times described Majid Al Futtaim's parent company as now being overseen by five government and four family representatives.",
      "Succession battles aren\u2019t unusual in the United Arab Emirates, where family-run businesses dominate private enterprise. Rulers have given merchant families broad control over different sectors in exchange for the promise of big investments and fast-paced development.",
      "But over the years, that economic strategy has caused headaches for authorities, who have intervened when patriarchs die and tensions between disgruntled relatives boil over.",
      "Majid Al Futtaim is a mainstay of the local consumer economy. It\u2019s also a giant in the broader Gulf Arab region, owning and operating prominent hotels, entertainment venues and shopping malls. Its portfolio includes the Mall of the Emirates, a major tourist draw in Dubai that houses the Middle East\u2019s first-ever indoor ski slope. It also runs regional franchises for global brands, including Lego.",

      "BAGHDAD -- Tensions have escalated between Iraq\u2019s central government in Baghdad and the semiautonomous Kurdish region in the country\u2019s north in a long-running dispute over the sharing of oil revenues.",
      "The central government has accused the Kurdish regional authorities of making illegal deals and facilitating oil smuggling. Baghdad cut off funding for public sector salaries in the Kurdish region ahead of the Eid al-Adha holiday. Kurdish authorities called the move \u201ccollective punishment\u201d and threatened to retaliate.",
      "It\u2019s the latest flare-up in a long-running dispute between officials in Baghdad and Irbil, the seat of the Kurdish regional government, over sharing of oil revenues. In 2014, the Kurdish region decided to unilaterally export oil through an independent pipeline to the Turkish port of Ceyhan.",
      "The central government considers it illegal for Irbil to export oil without going through the Iraqi national oil company and filed a case against Turkey in the International Court of Arbitration, arguing that Turkey was violating the provisions of the Iraqi-Turkish pipeline agreement signed in 1973.",
      "Iraq stopped sending oil through the pipeline in March 2023 after the arbitration court ruled in Baghdad\u2019s favor. Attempts to reach a deal to restart exports have repeatedly stalled.",
      "Last month, Prime Minister Masrour Barzani of the Iraqi Kurdish regional government traveled to Washington, where he inked two major energy deals with U.S. companies. The federal government in Baghdad then sued in an Iraqi court, asserting that it was illegal for the regional government to make the deals without going through Baghdad.",
      "The Iraqi Ministry of Finance announced a decision last month to halt funding for salaries of public sector employees in the Kurdish region. The move sparked widespread outrage in Irbil, triggering strong political and public reactions.",
      "The ministry said in a statement that the decision was due to the Kurdish regional authorities\u2019 \u201cfailure to hand over oil and non-oil revenues to the federal treasury, as stipulated in the federal budget laws.\u201d It added that any transfer of funds would be conditional on \u201cthe region\u2019s commitment to transparency and financial accountability.\u201d",
      "The federal Ministry of Oil accused Irbil of failing to deliver crude oil produced in the region\u2019s fields to the ministry for export through the state-run SOMO company, which it said had led to massive financial losses amounting to billions of dollars.",
      "The ministry warned that \u201ccontinued non-compliance jeopardizes Iraq\u2019s international reputation and obligations, forcing the federal government to reduce oil production in other provinces to stay within Iraq\u2019s OPEC quota \u2014 which includes Iraqi Kurdish production, regardless of its legality.\u201d",
      "Baghdad has also accused Irbil of smuggling oil out of the country. An Iraqi official who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to comment publicly said the government had tracked 240 cases of illegal border crossings from Iraq\u2019s Kurdish region into Iran between Dec. 25, 2024, and May 24, 2025, aimed at smuggling oil derivatives.",
      "The Kurdish region\u2019s Ministry of Natural Resources in a statement called those allegations \u201ca smokescreen to distract from widespread corruption and smuggling in other parts of Iraq. The KRG agreed to sell its oil through SOMO, opened an escrow account, and handed over revenues \u2014 yet Baghdad failed to meet its financial obligations.\u201d",
      "It accused the federal government of being responsible for the halt in oil exports via Turkey due to the lawsuit it filed in 2023 and said the Kurdish region had delivered over 11 million barrels of oil to the Ministry of Oil without receiving any financial compensation.",
      "The ministry accused Baghdad of \u201cviolating the constitution and pursuing a deliberate policy of collective punishment and starvation against the people\" of the Kurdish region through the halt in funding for salaries.",
      "Barzani in a statement on the eve of the Eid al-Adha holiday described the withholding of salaries as an \u201cunjust and oppressive decision\u201d and a \u201cpolicy of mass starvation\u201d comparable to the chemical attacks and \u201cgenocide\u201d launched by Iraq\u2019s former longtime strongman ruler, Saddam Hussein, against the Kurds.",
      "The Iraqi Kurdish people \"have resisted with steadfastness and courage in the face of all forms of pressure and tyranny\u201d and \u201cregret was the fate of the tyrants,\" he said.",
      "In the meantime, residents of the Kurdish region feel caught in the middle of the yearslong political dispute once again.",
      "Saman Ali Salah, a public school teacher from the city of Sulaimaniyah, said the salary cutoff comes at a particularly bad time for him \u2014 his daughter was hit by a car 40 days ago and is still in the hospital. He blamed both Baghdad and Irbil for the situation.",
      "\u201cAll the money I had was spent on transportation from the house to the hospital and I haven\u2019t paid my rent for the past two months,\" Salah said. \u201cI don\u2019t know what to do. All I can say is that God will take revenge on these so-called officials on Judgement Day.\u201d",

      "The crashes, which began late last year and carried into 2025, were the tipoff to a sophisticated cyberattack that may have allowed hackers to infiltrate a phone without a single click from the user.",
      "The attackers left no clues about their identities, but investigators at the cybersecurity firm iVerify noticed that the victims all had something in common: They worked in fields of interest to China's government and had been targeted by Chinese hackers in the past.",
      "Foreign hackers have increasingly identified smartphones, other mobile devices and the apps they use as a weak link in U.S. cyberdefenses. Groups linked to China's military and intelligence service have targeted the smartphones of prominent Americans and burrowed deep into telecommunication networks, according to national security and tech experts.",
      "It shows how vulnerable mobile devices and apps are and the risk that security failures could expose sensitive information or leave American interests open to cyberattack, those experts say.",
      "\u201cThe world is in a mobile security crisis right now,\u201d said Rocky Cole, a former cybersecurity expert at the National Security Agency and Google and now chief operations officer at iVerify. \u201cNo one is watching the phones.\u201d",

      "Mobile networks are a top concern. The U.S. and many of its closest allies have banned Chinese telecom companies from their networks. Other countries, including Germany, are phasing out Chinese involvement because of security concerns.

      "While most smartphones and tablets come with robust security, apps and connected devices often lack these protections or the regular software updates needed to stay ahead of new threats. That makes every fitness tracker, baby monitor or smart appliance another potential foothold for hackers looking to penetrate networks, retrieve information or infect systems with malware.",
      "Federal officials launched a program this year creating a \u201ccyber trust mark\u201d for connected devices that meet federal security standards.

      "The latest frictions began just a day after the May 12 announcement of the Geneva agreement to \u201cpause\u201d tariffs for 90 days.",
      "The U.S. Commerce Department issued guidance saying the use of Ascend AI chips from Huawei, a leading Chinese tech company, could violate U.S. export controls. That's because the chips were likely developed with American technology despite restrictions on its export to China, the guidance said.",
      "The Chinese government wasn't pleased. One of its biggest beefs in recent years has been over U.S. moves to limit the access of Chinese companies to technology, and in particular to equipment and processes needed to produce the most advanced semiconductors.",
      "\"The Chinese side urges the U.S. side to immediately correct its erroneous practices,\u201d a Commerce Ministry spokesperson said.",
      "U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick wasn't in Geneva but will join the talks in London. Analysts say that suggests at least a willingness on the U.S. side to hear out China's concerns on export controls.",
      "One area where China holds the upper hand is in the mining and processing of rare earths. They are crucial for not only autos but also a range of other products from robots to military equipment.",
      "The Chinese government started requiring producers to obtain a license to export seven rare earth elements in April. Resulting shortages sent automakers worldwide into a tizzy. As stockpiles ran down, some worried they would have to halt production.",
      "Trump, without mentioning rare earths specifically, took to social media to attack China.",
      "\u201cThe bad news is that China, perhaps not surprisingly to some, HAS TOTALLY VIOLATED ITS AGREEMENT WITH US,\u201d Trump posted on May 30.",
      "The Chinese government indicated Saturday that it is addressing the concerns, which have come from European companies as well. A Commerce Ministry statement said it had granted some approvals and \u201cwill continue to strengthen the approval of applications that comply with regulations.\u201d",
      "The scramble to resolve the rare earth issue shows that China has a strong card to play if it wants to strike back against tariffs or other measures.",
      "Student visas don't normally figure in trade talks, but a U.S. announcement that it would begin revoking the visas of some Chinese students has emerged as another thorn in the relationship.",
      "China's Commerce Ministry raised the issue when asked last week about the accusation that it had violated the consensus reached in Geneva.",
      "It replied that the U.S. had undermined the agreement by issuing export control guidelines for AI chips, stopping the sale of chip design software to China and saying it would revoke Chinese student visas.",
      "\u201cThe United States has unilaterally provoked new economic and trade frictions,\u201d the ministry said in a statement posted on its website.",
      "U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said in a May 28 statement that the United States would \u201caggressively revoke visas for Chinese students, including those with connections to the Chinese Communist Party or studying in critical fields.\u201d",

      "A new study that examined five years\u2019 worth of prices at one U.S. grocery chain found that digital price tags haven\u2019t led to demand-based pricing surges",
      "Digital price labels, which are rapidly replacing paper shelf tags at U.S. supermarkets, haven\u2019t led to demand-based pricing surges, according to a new study that examined five years' worth of prices at one grocery chain.",
      "But some shoppers, consumer advocates and lawmakers remain skeptical about the tiny electronic screens, which let stores change prices instantly from a central computer instead of having workers swap out paper labels by hand.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s corporations vs. the humans, and that chasm between us goes further and further,\u201d said Dan Gallant, who works in sports media in Edmonton, Canada. Gallant's local Loblaws supermarket recently switched to digital labels.",
      "Social media is filled with warnings that grocers will use the technology to charge more for ice cream if it\u2019s hot outside, hike the price of umbrellas if it\u2019s raining or to gather information about customers.",
      "Democratic U.S. Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Bob Casey of Pennsylvania fired off a letter to Kroger last fall demanding to know whether it would use its electronic labels as part of a dynamic pricing strategy.",
      "Lawmakers in Rhode Island and Maine have introduced bills to limit the use of digital labels. In Arizona, Democratic state Rep. Cesar Aguilar recently introduced a bill that would ban them altogether.",
      "The bill hasn\u2019t gotten a hearing, but Aguilar said he\u2019s determined to start a conversation about digital labels and how stores could abuse them.",
      "\u201cGrocery stores study when people go shopping the most. And so you might be able to see a price go down one day and then go up another day,\u201d Aguilar told The Associated Press.",
      "Researchers say those fears are misplaced. A study published in late May found \u201cvirtually no surge pricing\u201d before or after electronic shelf labels were adopted. The study was authored by Ioannis Stamatopoulos of the University of Texas, Austin, Robert Evan Sanders of the University of California, San Diego and Robert Bray of Northwestern University",
      "The researchers looked at prices between 2019 and 2024 at an unnamed grocery chain than began using digital labels in October 2022. They found that temporary price increases affected 0.005% of products on any given day before electronic shelf labels were introduced, a share that increased by only 0.0006 percentage points after digital labels were installed.",
      "The study also determined that discounts were slightly more common after digital labels were introduced.",
      "Economists have long wondered why grocery prices don\u2019t change more often, according to Stamatopoulos. If bananas are about to expire, for example, it makes sense to lower the price on them. He said the cost of having workers change prices by hand could be one issue.",
      "But there\u2019s another reason: Shoppers watch grocery prices closely, and stores don\u2019t want to risk angering them.",
      "\u201cSelling groceries is not selling a couch. It\u2019s not a one-time transaction and you will never see them again,\u201d Stamatopoulos said. \u201cYou want them coming to the store every week.\u201d",
      "Electronic price labels aren\u2019t new. They\u2019ve been in use for more than a decade at groceries in Europe and some U.S. retailers, like Kohl's.",
      "But they\u2019ve been slow to migrate to U.S. grocery stores. Only around 5% to 10% of U.S. supermarkets now have electronic labels, compared to 80% in Europe, said Amanda Oren, vice president of industry strategy for North American grocery at Relex Solutions, a technology company that helps retailers forecast demand.",
      "Oren said cost is one issue that has slowed the U.S. rollout. The tiny screens cost between $5 and $20, Oren said, but every product a store sells needs one, and the average supermarket has 100,000 or more individual products.",
      "Still, the U.S. industry is charging ahead. Walmart, the nation's largest grocer and retailer, hopes to have digital price labels at 2,300 U.S. stores by 2026. Kroger is expanding the use of digital labels this year after testing them at 20 stores. Whole Foods is testing the labels in nearly 50 stores.",
      "Companies say electronic price labels have tremendous advantages. Walmart says it used to take employees two days to change paper price labels on the 120,000 items it has in a typical store. With digital tags, it takes a few minutes.",
      "The labels can also be useful. Some have codes shoppers can scan to see recipes or nutrition information. Instacart has a system in thousands of U.S. stores, including Aldi and Schnucks, that flashes a light on the digital tag when Instacart shoppers are nearby to help them find products.",
      "Ahold Delhaize\u2019s Albert Heijn supermarket chain in the Netherlands and Belgium has been testing an artificial intelligence-enabled tool since 2022 that marks down prices on its digital labels every 15 minutes for products nearing expiration. The system has reduced more than 250 tons of food waste annually, the company said.",
      "But Warren and Casey are skeptical. In their letter to Kroger, the U.S. senators noted a partnership with Microsoft that planned to put cameras in grocery aisles and offer personalized deals to shoppers depending on their gender and age.",
      "In its response, Kroger said the prices shown on its digital labels were not connected to any sort of facial recognition technology. It also denied surging prices during periods of peak demand.",
      "\u201cKroger\u2019s business model is built on a foundation of lowering prices to attract more customers,\u201d the company said.",
      "Aguilar, the Arizona lawmaker, said he also opposes the transition to digital labels because he thinks they will cost jobs. His constituents have pointed out that grocery prices keep rising even though there are fewer workers in checkout lanes, he said.",
      "\u201cThey are supposed to be part of our community, and that means hiring people from our community that fill those jobs,\" Aguilar said.",
      "But Relex Solutions' Oren said she doesn't think cutting labor costs is the main reason stores deploy digital price tags.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s about working smarter, not harder, and being able to use that labor in better ways across the store rather than these very mundane, repetitive tasks,\u201d she said.",

    "story": [
      "The tax cuts in President Donald Trump\u2019s One Big Beautiful Bill would likely gouge a $2.4 trillion hole in the federal budget",
      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014",
      "The tax cuts in President Donald Trump\u2019s One Big Beautiful Bill Act would likely gouge a hole in the federal budget.",
      "The president has a patch handy, though: his sweeping import taxes \u2014 tariffs.",
      "The Congressional Budget Office, the government\u2019s nonpartisan arbiter of tax and spending matters, says the One Big Beautiful Bill, passed by the House last month and now under consideration in the Senate, would increase federal budget deficits by $2.4 trillion over the next decade. That is because its tax cuts would drain the government\u2019s coffers faster than its spending cuts would save money.",
      "By bringing in revenue for the Treasury, on the other hand, the tariffs that Trump announced through May 13 \u2014 including his so-called reciprocal levies of up to 50% on countries with which the United States has a trade deficit \u2014 would offset the budget impact of the tax-cut bill and reduce deficits over the next decade by $2.5 trillion.",
      "So it\u2019s basically a wash.",
      "That\u2019s the budget math anyway. The real answer is more complicated.",
      "Actually using tariffs to finance a big chunk of the federal government would be a painful and perilous undertaking, budget wonks say. \u201cIt\u2019s a very dangerous way to try to raise revenue,\u201d said Kent Smetters of the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s Penn Wharton Budget Model, who served in President George W. Bush\u2019s Treasury Department.",
      "Trump has long advocated tariffs as an economic elixir. He says they can protect American industries, bring factories back to the United States, give him leverage to win concessions over foreign governments \u2014 and raise a lot of money. He\u2019s even suggested that they could replace the federal income tax, which now brings in about half of federal revenue.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s possible we\u2019ll do a complete tax cut,\u2019\u2019 he told reporters in April. \u201cI think the tariffs will be enough to cut all of the income tax.\u2019\u2019",
      "Economists and budget analysts do not share the president\u2019s enthusiasm for using tariffs to finance the government or to replace other taxes. \u201cIt\u2019s a really bad trade,\u2019\u2019 said Erica York, the Tax Foundation\u2019s vice president of federal tax policy. \u201cIt\u2019s perhaps the dumbest tax reform you could design.\u2019\u2019",
      "For one thing, Trump\u2019s tariffs are an unstable source of revenue. He bypassed Congress and imposed his biggest import tax hikes through executive orders. That means a future president could simply reverse them.",
      "\u201cOr political whims in Congress could change, and they could decide, \u2018Hey, we\u2019re going revoke this authority because we don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good thing that the president can just unilaterally impose a $2 trillion tax hike,\u2019 \u2019\u2019 York said.",
      "Or the courts could kill his tariffs before Congress or future presidents do. A federal court in New York has already struck down the centerpiece of his tariff program \u2014 the reciprocal and other levies he announced on what he called \u201cLiberation Day\u2019\u2019 April 2 \u2014 saying he\u2019d overstepped his authority. An appeals court has allowed the government to keep collecting the levies while the legal challenge winds its way through the court system.",
      "Economists also say that tariffs damage the economy. They are a tax on foreign products, paid by importers in the United States and usually passed along to their customers via higher prices. They raise costs for U.S. manufacturers that rely on imported raw materials, components and equipment, making them less competitive than foreign rivals that don\u2019t have to pay Trump\u2019s tariffs.",
      "Tariffs also invite retaliatory taxes on U.S. exports by foreign countries. Indeed, the European Union this week threatened \u201ccountermeasures\u2019\u2019 against Trump\u2019s unexpected move to raise his tariff on foreign steel and aluminum to 50%.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re not just getting the effect of a tax on the U.S. economy,\u201d York said. \u201cYou\u2019re also getting the effect of foreign taxes on U.S. exports.\u2019\u2019",
      "She said the tariffs will basically wipe out all economic benefits from the One Big Beautiful Bill's tax cuts.",
      "Smetters at the Penn Wharton Budget Model said that tariffs also isolate the United States and discourage foreigners from investing in its economy.",
      "Foreigners see U.S. Treasurys as a super-safe investment and now own about 30% of the federal government\u2019s debt. If they cut back, the federal government would have to pay higher interest rates on Treasury debt to attract a smaller number of potential investors domestically.",
      "Higher borrowing costs and reduced investment would wallop the economy, making tariffs the most economically destructive tax available, Smetters said \u2014 more than twice as costly in reduced economic growth and wages as what he sees as the next-most damaging: the tax on corporate earnings.",
      "Tariffs also hit the poor hardest. They end up being a tax on consumers, and the poor spend more of their income than wealthier people do.",
      "Even without the tariffs, the One Big Beautiful Bill slams the poorest because it makes deep cuts to federal food programs and to Medicaid, which provides health care to low-income Americans. After the bill\u2019s tax and spending cuts, an analysis by the Penn Wharton Budget Model found, the poorest fifth of American households earning less than $17,000 a year would see their incomes drop by $820 next year. The richest 0.1% earning more than $4.3 million a year would come out ahead by $390,070 in 2026.",
      "\u201cIf you layer a regressive tax increase like tariffs on top of that, you make a lot of low- and middle-income households substantially worse off,\u2019\u2019 said the Tax Foundation\u2019s York.",
      "Overall, she said, tariffs are \u201ca very unreliable source of revenue for the legal reasons, the political reasons as well as the economic reasons. They\u2019re a very, very inefficient way to raise revenue. If you raise a dollar of a revenue with tariffs, that\u2019s going to cause a lot more economic harm than raising revenue any other way.\u2019\u2019",

      "Air quality regulators in Southern California are debating proposed rules that would curb harmful emissions from gas-powered furnaces and water heaters",
      "DIAMOND BAR, Calif. -- Air quality regulators in Southern California heard impassioned public comments Friday before an anticipated vote on proposed rules that would curb harmful emissions from gas-powered furnaces and water heaters.",
      "The rules aim to reduce emissions of smog-contributing nitrogen oxides, also called NOx, a group of pollutants linked to respiratory issues, asthma attacks, worse allergies, decreased lung function in children, premature death and more. Burning natural gas is also one of the primary drivers of climate change.",
      "The South Coast Air Quality Management District estimates that the rules, if passed, will lower NOx emissions from gas-fired furnaces, preventing about 2,490 premature deaths and 10,200 new asthma cases over a 26-year period in the region. The district regulates air quality for 16.8 million people in Southern California, including all of Orange County and large areas of Los Angeles, Riverside and San Bernardino counties \u2014 one of the smoggiest areas in the U.S.",
      "The proposals come as California moves aggressively to reduce the state\u2019s reliance on planet-warming fossil fuels and ahead of a 2045 mandate for the state to have net-zero carbon emissions.",
      "The rules would set targets that aim to phase out the sale of gas-powered furnaces and water heaters starting in 2027. It does not apply to gas stoves. The sales target would start at 30%, then grow to 50% in 2029 and end at 90% in 2039. The rules would not be mandated, but manufacturers would have to pay fees ranging from $50 to $500 if they sell gas-powered appliances.",
      "That's a significant rollback from the original proposal, which would have required residential buildings to meet zero-emissions standards beginning in 2029 when appliances need to be replaced. The agency amended the rules after strong opposition from Southern California Gas and other businesses.",
      "The regulations would impact more than 10 million appliances in an estimated 5 million buildings, most of them residential.",
      "Officials and supporters say the rules would reduce air pollution and substantially improve public health. But opponents \u2014 including property owners, industry professionals and natural gas companies \u2014 fear they could raise costs for consumers and businesses, and strain the power grid by adding more electric appliances.",

      "\u201cI don't believe that there's necessarily a good or right answer about these rules. I believe that it is very complicated and I know that every single one of these board members are doing what is right to move forward air quality goals in our region,\" she said.",
      "Lynwood City Councilmember Juan Mu\u00f1oz-Guevara said the rules would be a long-overdue step toward environmental justice for communities like his.",
      "\u201cI've seen firsthand how families in my community are forced to live with the health consequences of dirty air. Our children grow up with asthma, our elders struggle with respiratory illness, and too many lives are cut short,\" he said. \"Gas appliances in our home are one of the largest sources of smog-forming pollution in the region. We cannot meet clean air goals without tackling this.\u201d",
      "Peggy Huang, a member of Yorba Linda's City Council, urged the board to reject the rules.",
      "\u201cAs someone who's been advocating for affordable housing, this will increase costs for us to meet those goals,\u201d Huang said.",
      "Chino's mayor pro tem, Curtis Burton, echoed some of Huang's concerns. He said the rules would \u201ccreate an additional financial burden on residents and businesses.\u201d",

      "\u201cOur mission is to make volunteering and service easier, more impactful, more sustained,\" Bush said. \"Because, let\u2019s be honest, the problems in our communities aren\u2019t going to fix themselves.\u201d",
      "According to data from the U.S. Census Bureau and AmeriCorps, the rate of participation has plateaued since 2002, with a noticeable dip during the pandemic.",
      "Susan M. Chambr\u00e9, professor emerita at Baruch College who studied volunteering for decades, said Points of Light's goal of doubling the number of volunteers was admirable but unrealistic, given that volunteer rates have not varied significantly over time.",
      "But she said more research is needed into what motivates volunteers, which would give insight into how to recruit people. She also said volunteering has become more transactional over time, directed by staff as opposed to organized by volunteers themselves.",
      "In making its case for increasing volunteer participation in a recent report, Points of Light drew on research from nonprofits like Independent Sector, the National Alliance for Volunteer Engagement and the Do Good Institute at the University of Maryland.",
      "Sirangelo said they want to better measure the impact volunteers make, not just the hours they put in, for example. They also see a major role for technology to better connect potential volunteers to opportunities, though they acknowledge that many have tried to do that through apps and online platforms.",
      "Reaching young people will also be a major part of accomplishing this increase in volunteer participation. Sirangelo said she's observed that many young people who do want to participate are founding their own nonprofits rather than joining an existing one.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re not welcoming them to our institutions, so they have to go found something,\u201d she said. \u201cThat dynamic has to change.\u201d",
      "As the board was considering this new goal, they reached out for advice to Alex Edgar, who is now the youth engagement manager at Made By Us. They ultimately invited him to join the board as a full voting member and agreed to bring on a second young person as well.",
      "\u201cI think for volunteering and the incredible work that Points of Light is leading to really have a deeper connection with my generation, it needs to be done in a way that isn\u2019t just talking to or at young people, but really co-created across generations,\u201d said Edgar, who is 21.",
      "Karmit Bulman, who has researched and supported volunteer engagement for many years, said she was very pleased to see Points of Light make this commitment.",
      "\u201cThey are probably the most well known volunteerism organization in the country and I really appreciate their leadership,\u201d said Bulman, who is currently the executive director of East Side Learning Center, a nonprofit in St. Paul.",
      "Bulman said there are many people willing to help out in their communities but who are not willing to jump through hoops to volunteer with a nonprofit.",
      "\u201cWe also need to recognize that it\u2019s a pretty darn stressful time in people\u2019s lives right now,\u201d she said. \"There\u2019s a lot of uncertainty personally and professionally and financially for a lot of people. So we need to be really, really flexible in how we engage volunteers.\"",

      "The Michaels Companies announced on Thursday that it had completed its purchase of Joann's intellectual property and private label brands \u2014 in an acquisition that arrives as the Texas-based arts and crafting chain works to expand its own fabric, sewing and yarn offerings.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re honored to have the opportunity to welcome JOANN customers into our creative community and are committed to delivering the selection, value, and inspiration they are looking for at Michaels,\u201d Michaels CEO David Boone said in a statement. The deal, he added, allows the company to better \u201crespond to rising demand\u201d among both new and existing customers.",
      "Financial terms of the acquisition were not disclosed. The Associated Press reached out to Michaels for further information on Friday.",
      "With roots dating back to a single Ohio storefront in 1943, Joann had grown into a destination for generations of sewers, quilters, knitters and lovers of other crafts for more than 80 years. But more recently, operational challenges continued to pile up \u2014 with the retailer pointing to sluggish consumer demand, inventory shortages and rising competition.",
      "Joann announced it would be going out of business back in February, just one month after filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection for the second time within a year. At the time, the company said financial services company GA Group, together with Joann\u2019s term lenders, had been selected as the winning bidder to \u201cacquire substantially all of Joann\u2019s assets\u201d and conduct going-out-of-business sales at all store locations.",
      "Michaels on Thursday said that its purchase of Joann's IP and private brands included the acquisition of \u201cBig Twist\u201d yarns, which had become a staple in Joann stores over the years.",
      "Those \u201cBig Twist\u201d labels are now being developed as part of Michaels' portfolio \u2014 and will be available in-stores and online later this year, the company said. In the meantime, Michaels has also dedicated a landing page to welcome former Joann customers online.",
      "And as part of its overall expansion into fabrics, Michaels said on Thursday that its adding more than 600 new products from new and existing brands \u2014 including quilting supplies and fabrics, specialty threads, sewing machines and more.",
      "Michaels, founded in 1973, currently operates 1,300 stores across 49 U.S. states and Canada. Its parent company also owns Artistree, a framing merchandise manufacturer.",

      "President Donald Trump and billionaire Elon Musk are showing no signs of reconciling on Friday, but Republicans are increasingly urging them to settle their dispute",
      "WASHINGTON -- As the Republican Party braces for aftershocks from President Donald Trump's spectacular clash with Elon Musk, lawmakers and conservative figures are urging d\u00e9tente, fearful of the potential consequences from a prolonged feud.",
      "At a minimum, the explosion of animosity between the two powerful men could complicate the path forward for Republicans' massive tax and border spending legislation that has been promoted by Trump but assailed by Musk.",
      "\u201cI hope it doesn\u2019t distract us from getting the job done that we need to,\u201d said Rep. Dan Newhouse, a Republican from Washington state. \"I think that it will boil over and they\u2019ll mend fences\u201d",
      "Sen. Ted Cruz, a Texas Republican, was similarly optimistic.",
      "\u201cI hope that both of them come back together because when the two of them are working together, we\u2019ll get a lot more done for America than when they\u2019re at cross purposes,\u201d he told Fox News host Sean Hannity on Thursday night.",
      "Sen. Mike Lee, a Republican from Utah, sounded almost pained on social media as Trump and Musk volleyed insults at each other, sharing a photo composite of the two men and writing, \"But \u2026 I really like both of them.\u201d",
      "\u201cWho else really wants @elonmusk and @realDonaldTrump to reconcile?\u201d Lee posted, later adding: \u201cRepost if you agree that the world is a better place with the Trump-Musk bromance fully intact.\u201d",
      "So far, the feud between Trump and Musk is probably best described as a moving target, with plenty of opportunities for escalation or detente.",
      "One person familiar with the president\u2019s thinking said Musk wants to speak with Trump, but that the president doesn\u2019t want to do it \u2013 or at least do it on Friday. The person requested anonymity to disclose private matters.",
      "In a series of conversations with television anchors Friday morning, Trump showed no interest in burying the hatchet. Asked on ABC News about reports of a potential call between him and Musk, the president responded: \u201cYou mean the man who has lost his mind?\u201d",
      "Trump added in the ABC interview that he was \u201cnot particularly\u201d interested in talking to Musk at the moment.",
      "Still, others remained hopeful that it all would blow over.",
      "\u201cI grew up playing hockey and there wasn\u2019t a single day that we played hockey or basketball or football or baseball, whatever we were playing, where we didn\u2019t fight. And then we\u2019d fight, then we\u2019d become friends again,\u201d Hannity said on his show Thursday night.",
      "Acknowledging that it \u201cgot personal very quick,\u201d Hannity nonetheless added that the rift was \u201cjust a major policy difference.\u201d",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson projected confidence that the dispute would not affect prospects for the tax and border bill.",
      "\u201cMembers are not shaken at all,\u201d the Louisiana Republican said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to pass this legislation on our deadline.\u201d",
      "He added that he hopes Musk and Trump reconcile, saying \u201cI believe in redemption\u201d and \u201cit's good for the party and the country if all that's worked out.\u201d",
      "But he also had something of a warning for the billionaire entrepreneur.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ll tell you what, do not doubt and do not second-guess and don\u2019t ever challenge the president of the United States, Donald Trump,\u201d Johnson said. \"He is the leader of the party.

      "Home decor's got a split personality this year: Call it \u201ccity glow\u201d and \u201ccottage flow.\u201d",
      "At the two international design fairs that I attended \u2014 Maison et Objet in France, Ambiente in Germany \u2014 acres of exhibition booths were full of Art Deco furnishings, island-vibe rattan seating and lighting, and lots of emphasis on sustainably produced materials.",
      "But a couple of aesthetics drawing crowds were especially interesting.",
      "One was an exuberant urban vibe I\u2019m nicknaming \u201ccity glow.\u201d It\u2019s full of highlighter-hued throw pillows, edgy surrealism, street art and hefty, Brutalist-style furniture \u2014 lots of sharp-cornered steel or concrete consoles and lamps that loomed over rooms \u2014 as well as rugs and wallcoverings covered in graffiti-style motifs or swaths of vibrant color.",
      "Gretchen Rivera, an interior designer in Washington, D.C., sees it as a look that resonates especially with \u201cyounger generations who grew up with digital influences. There\u2019s surrealist art, energetic colors and playful, almost toy-like design.\u201d",
      "Interior designer Anton Liakhov in Nice, France, agrees: \u201cFor a generation clamoring for creativity and self-expression, it\u2019s loud and in-your-face.\u201d",
      "For surface colors, look at Benjamin Moore\u2019s spicy orange Bryce Canyon or the bubblegum-pink Springtime Bloom. Daydream Apothecary has a whole collection of neon wall paints for intrepid decorators.",
      "Sisters Ana and Lola S\u00e1nchez use art as a bold form of self-expression at their luxe brand Oliver Gal, in South Florida. It's known for its handcrafted, statement-making pieces \u2014 including large acrylic gummy bears, graphic surfboards and wall art inspired by fashion, pop culture and modern surrealism. The result is a vibrant, edgy aesthetic.",
      "A new collection, Rococo Pop, introduces rococo-inspired frames in high-gloss acrylics paired with playful graphic imagery. \u201cWe wanted to take the opulence of 18th century rococo,\u201d notes Ana S\u00e1nchez, \u201cand give it a cheeky, pop-art punch.\u201d",
      "\u201cThese frames are like little rebels in ballgowns \u2014 elegant, over-the-top and totally unexpected,\u201d adds Lola S\u00e1nchez.",
      "The style, her sister says, \u201ccelebrates contrast. Old World charm meets modern mischief.\u201d",
      "The other impressive decor style at the design fairs was very different from the urban look. I\u2019m calling this one \u201ccottage flow,\u201d and Liakhov describes it as evoking a \u201cpeaceful sanctuary, where you can play around with textures that are anchored in, and in tune with, nature.\u201d",
      "Think nubby woolen throws in mossy hues. Softly burnished wooden tables. Vintage quilts, and dishware. Gingham and garden florals. Landscape prints. Imagery of birds and woodland animals on textiles and wallcoverings.",
      "Etsy\u2019s 2025 spring/summer trend report showed that searches for \u201cFrench cottage decor\u201d were up over 26,000% compared to 2024.",
      "\u201cI see people embracing a slower pace to life where they can,\u201d says New York-based interior and decor designer Kathy Kuo about the country cottage style.",
      "\u201cThe past two decades or so were dominated by a glorification of fast-paced \u2018hustle culture\u2019 \u2014 trends like cottagecore and coastal grandmother are evidence that the pendulum\u2019s swinging toward taking pleasure in simpler, more nature-adjacent things in life, whether or not you actually live in a country cottage,\u201d she says.",
      "Paint colors are also reflecting the trend. A calming sage green called Quietude is HGTV Home by Sherwin-Williams\u2019 color of the year. Little-Greene\u2019s collection has names like Rolling Fog, Tea with Florence and Hammock.",
      "Watching design show visitors excitedly discovering new finds among the aisles, I thought THIS is what\u2019s fun about home decorating: You can think as creatively as you like when it comes to your own home.",
      "You\u2019re all about high-octane city nightlife? Come this way.",
      "Scottish crofts, Scandi cabins and cozy porches more your thing? Right over here.",
      "And if you want to mix these two aesthetics? Go for it. There\u2019s space to blend elements of both, says Kuo.",
      "\u201cDesign trends are so fluid. I absolutely see the potential to merge these into each other,\u201d she says. \u201cMany city dwellers love time in nature and have an affinity for a more rustic look, while still feeling called to honor their urban environment in their home. I see plenty of modern interior design motifs that are sleek and urban on the surface, but in the details, they\u2019re infused with organic textures and biophilic elements.\u201d",
      "\u201cReally, the best designs are the ones that are personal, rather than perfect,\u201d she adds.",
      "You could display an array of contemporary glass bowls on a curvy walnut credenza. Mix botanical patterns in vibrant, unexpected colors. Soften room elements like a sleek table and industrial-style lamp with boucle or velvet cushions and a fluffy rug. Pair polished concrete floors with vintage-inspired wallcovering.",
      "If you don\u2019t want to mix elements in one space, consider using sliding partitions from one room to another. You\u2019ll create a little style \u201cjourney.\u201d",
      "If the recent international design fairs are any indication, you\u2019re going to find loads of fun home decor in stores over the coming months. Get ready to flow.",

      "The Pentagon watchdog is looking into whether any of Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth\u2019s staffers was asked to delete Signal messages that may have shared sensitive military information with a reporter",
      "WASHINGTON -- The Pentagon watchdog is looking into whether any of Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's aides was asked to delete Signal messages that may have shared sensitive military information with a reporter, according to two people familiar with the investigation and documents reviewed by The Associated Press.",
      "The inspector general's request focuses on how information about the March 15 airstrikes on Houthi targets in Yemen was shared on the messaging app.",
      "This comes as Hegseth is scheduled to testify before Congress next week for the first time since his confirmation hearing. He is likely to face questions under oath not only about his handling of sensitive information but also the wider turmoil at the Pentagon following the departures of several senior aides and an internal investigation over information leaks.",
      "Hegseth already has faced questions over the installation of an unsecured internet line in his office that bypassed the Pentagon\u2019s security protocols and revelations that he shared details about the military strikes in multiple Signal chats.",
      "One of the chats included his wife and brother, while the other included President Donald Trump\u2019s top national security officials and inadvertently included The Atlantic's editor-in-chief, Jeffrey Goldberg.",
      "Neither the Pentagon nor the inspector general\u2019s office immediately responded to Friday requests for comment on the investigation.",
      "Besides finding out whether anyone was asked to delete Signal messages, the inspector general also is asking some past and current staffers who were with Hegseth on the day of the strikes who posted the information and who had access to his phone, according to the two people familiar with the investigation and the documents reviewed by the AP. The people were not authorized to discuss the investigation and spoke on the condition of anonymity.",
      "Democratic lawmakers and a small number of Republicans have said that the information Hegseth posted to the Signal chats before the military jets had reached their targets could have put those pilots' lives at risk and that for any lower-ranking members of the military it would have led to their firing.",
      "Hegseth has said none of the information was classified. Multiple current and former military officials have said there is no way details with that specificity, especially before a strike took place, would have been OK to share on an unsecured device.",
      "\u201cI said repeatedly, nobody is texting war plans,\u201d Hegseth told Fox News Channel in April after reporting emerged about the chat that included his family members. \u201cI look at war plans every day. What was shared over Signal then and now, however you characterize it, was informal, unclassified coordinations, for media coordinations and other things. That\u2019s what I\u2019ve said from the beginning.\u201d",
      "Trump has made clear that Hegseth continues to have his support, saying during a Memorial Day speech at Arlington National Cemetery in Virginia that the defense secretary \u201cwent through a lot\u201d but \u201che's doing really well.\u201d",
      "Hegseth has limited his public engagements with the press since the Signal controversy. He has yet to hold a Pentagon press briefing, and his spokesman has briefed reporters there only once.",
      "The inspector general is investigating Hegseth at the request of the Republican chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, Sen. Roger Wicker of Mississippi, and the committee's top Democrat, Sen. Jack Reed of Rhode Island.",
      "Signal is a publicly available app that provides encrypted communications, but it can be hacked and is not approved for carrying classified information. On March 14, one day before the strikes against the Houthis, the Defense Department cautioned personnel about the vulnerability of the app.",
      "Trump has said his administration targeted the Houthis over their \u201cunrelenting campaign of piracy, violence and terrorism.\u201d He has noted the disruption Houthi attacks caused through the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden, key waterways for energy and cargo shipments between Asia and Europe through Egypt\u2019s Suez Canal.",
      "The Houthi rebels attacked more than 100 merchant vessels with missiles and drones, sinking two vessels and killing four sailors, between November 2023 until January this year. Their leadership described the attacks as aimed at ending the Israeli war against Hamas in the Gaza Strip.",

      "At least 40% of India\u2019s more than 1.4 billion people have no access to the internet. Cheap satellite broadband is needed to bridge this gap, particularly in India\u2019s vast remote and mountainous rural areas.",

      "Outside, the real sky isn\u2019t always blue. Sometimes it\u2019s hazy, with pollution drifting from coal-fired power plants in this part of southwest Indiana. Knowing exactly how much, and what it may be doing to the people who live there, is why Brockman got involved with a local environmental organization that\u2019s installing air and water quality monitors in her community.",

      "In a way, Brockman\u2019s monitoring echoes the reporting that the Environmental Protection Agency began requiring from large polluters more than a decade ago. Emissions from four coal-fired plants in southwest Indiana have dropped 60% since 2010, when the rule took effect.",
      "That rule is now on the chopping block, one of many that President Donald Trump\u2019s EPA argues is costly and burdensome for industry.",

And they say losing the data \u2014 at the same time the EPA is cutting air quality monitoring elsewhere \u2014 would make it tougher to fight climate change.",
      "At stake is the Greenhouse Gas Reporting program, a 2009 rule from President Barack Obama's administration that affects large carbon polluters like refineries, power plants, wells and landfills. In the years since, they've collectively reported a 20% drop in emissions, mostly driven by the closure of coal plants.",
      "And what happens at these big emitters makes a difference. Their declining emissions account for more than three-quarters of the overall, if modest, decline in all U.S. greenhouse gas emissions since 2010.",
      "The registry includes places not usually thought of as big polluters but that have notable greenhouse gas emissions, such as college campuses, breweries and cereal factories. Even Walt Disney World in Florida, where pollution dropped 62% since 2010, has to report along with nearly 10,600 other places.",
      "\"We can\u2019t solve climate change without knowing how much pollution major facilities are emitting and how that\u2019s changing over time,\" said Jeremy Symons, a former EPA senior climate adviser now at Environmental Protection Network, an organization of ex-EPA officials that monitors environmental policies. The group provided calculations as a part of The Associated Press' analysis of impacts from proposed rule rollbacks.",
      "Symons said some companies would welcome the end of the registry because it would make it easier to pollute.",
      "It\u2019s not clear how much the registry itself has contributed to declining emissions. More targeted regulations on smokestack emissions, as well as coal being crowded out by cheaper and less polluting natural gas, are bigger factors.",
      "But the registry \u201cdoes put pressure on companies to ... document what they\u2019ve done or at least to provide a baseline for what they\u2019ve done,\u201d said Stanford University climate scientist Rob Jackson, who heads Global Carbon Project, a group of scientists that tally national carbon emissions yearly.",
      "Gina McCarthy, a former EPA administrator under Obama, said the registry makes clear how power plants are doing against each other, and that's an inducement to lower emissions.",
      "\"It is money for those companies. It's costs. It's reputation. It's been, I think, a wonderful success story and I hope it continues.\u201d",
      "The potential end of the reporting requirement comes as experts say much of the country's air goes unmonitored. Nelson Arley Roque, a Penn State professor who co-authored a study in April on these \u201cmonitoring deserts,\u201d said about 40% of U.S. lands are unmonitored. That often includes poor and rural neighborhoods.",
      "\"The air matters to all of us, but apparently 50 million people can\u2019t know or will never know'' how bad the air is, Roque said.",
      "The EPA is also trying to claw back money that had been earmarked for air monitoring, part of the termination of grants that it has labeled as targeting diversity, equity and inclusion. That includes $500,000 that would have funded 40 air monitors in a low-income and minority community in the Charlotte, North Carolina, area.",
      "CleaneAIRE NC, a nonprofit that works to improve air quality across the state that was awarded the grant, is suing.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not diversity, equity and inclusion. It\u2019s human rights,\u201d said Daisha Wall, the group's community science program manager. \u201cWe all deserve a right to clean air.\u201d",
      "Research strongly links poor air quality to diseases like asthma and heart disease, with a slightly less established link to cancer. Near polluting industries, experts say what\u2019s often lacking is either enough data in specific locations or the will to investigate the health toll.",
      "Indiana says it \u201cmaintains a robust statewide monitoring and assessment program for air, land and water,\u201d but Brockman and others in this part of the state aren\u2019t satisfied. They\u2019re installing their own air and water quality monitors. It\u2019s a full-time job to keep the network of monitors up and running, fighting spotty Wi-Fi and connectivity issues.",
      "Fighting industry is a sensitive subject, Brockman added. Many families depend on jobs at coal-fired power plants, and poverty is real. She keeps snacks in her desk for the kids who haven\u2019t eaten breakfast.",
      "\u201cBut you also don\u2019t want to hear of another student that has a rare cancer,\u201d she said.",

      "FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. -- A.J. Greer is back in for the Florida Panthers in Game 3 of the Stanley Cup Final on Monday night after missing the first two in the series against the Edmonton Oilers because of injury.",
      "Coach Paul Maurice confirmed Greer would return on Florida\u2019s fourth line. Jesper Boqvist comes out of the lineup to make room for Greer, who will be making his first career appearance in the final.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s definitely a dream come true, but I\u2019m not really trying to focus on that,\u201d Greer said after the team's morning skate. \u201cIt\u2019s another game for me and I\u2019m just trying to enjoy it, but I\u2019m not trying to associate anything bigger than just my next shift, really.\u201d",
      "Greer, 28, gutted through injury for part of this playoff run before exiting in the Eastern Conference final against Carolina when it was clear he wasn't healthy enough to stay in. Maurice lauded Greer for his lack of selfishness and an abundance of self-awareness to understand when the pain threshold was reached and do what's best for the team.",
      "\u201cGood on him for recognizing that,\u201d Maurice said. \u201cWe were fortunate that we were able to heal A.J. to a place that he\u2019s really confident in what he\u2019s doing. ... He\u2019s been such a positive part of what we do.\u201d",
      "Greer almost wasn't here at all. A little over four years ago, he was languishing in the minors and almost giving up on his NHL dream.",
      "\u201cI was pretty much 24 hours away from just calling it, going to Europe and trying to just get a paycheck, trying to squeeze out every dollar that I can out of this sport and then live my life,\u201d Greer said. \u201cFortunately, things kind of bounced my way.\u201d",
      "Greer was essentially a throw-in as part of a trade to the New Jersey Devils that got the New York Islanders Kyle Palmieri and Travis Zajac, who helped them reach the East final. Greer \u2014 who was a second-round pick of Colorado in 2015 and played 37 games for the Avalanche from 2016-18 \u2014 developed some confidence with the American Hockey League's Utica Comets and cracked the Devils' roster a few times.",
      "Agent Philippe Lecavalier challenged Greer over whether he wanted to be an AHL player or adapt his style to be a role player in the NHL.",
      "\u201cYou could say I wanted to try to prove him wrong,\u201d Greer said. \u201cI kind of just went day by day, got better mentally, physically and matured with my game. I understood if I wanted to ever play in the NHL again, the way I have to play and the things I have to do \u2014 and I got a chance, so I\u2019m very grateful for that. It all led up to here.\u201d",
      "At 6-foot-3 and 209 pounds, Greer has been a physical force for Florida as the Panthers try to repeat as champions. He is one of the newcomers, along with their leading scorer in the final, Nate Schmidt, and teammates are happy to have Greer back.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s a pain to play against,\u201d Evan Rodrigues said. \u201cHe\u2019s a guy that can change the momentum of a game. He\u2019s heavy on the forecheck. For the most part, I don\u2019t think you want to get hit by him. He\u2019s a really good presence for us. And he chips in offensively. He lays the body. Just overall a pain the neck to play against.\u201d",
      "That came with time and trial and error as Greer learned how to have an impact with limited ice time. This spring brought his first taste of the Stanley Cup playoffs, and he has made the most of his nearly eight minutes a game.",
      "\u201cMy game\u2019s grown, especially this year,\u201d Greer said. \u201cMy confidence has grown, and I\u2019m ready to take on the biggest challenge that I\u2019ve really faced in my career.\u201d",

      "The takeaways from Carlos Alcaraz\u2019s fifth-set tiebreaker victory over Jannik Sinner in the French Open men\u2019s final are multiple and significant",
      "The takeaways from Carlos Alcaraz's fifth-set tiebreaker victory over Jannik Sinner in the riveting and record-breaking French Open men's final were multiple and significant.",
      "Let's start with this: Anyone worried about how men's tennis would survive in the post-Big Three era can rest easy. Alcaraz and Sinner produced 5 1/2 hours of evidence Sunday that the game is in good hands \u2014 and that their rivalry will be, and perhaps already is, a transcendent one.",
      "Take it from no less an authority than Roger Federer. The retired owner of 20 Grand Slam titles, and rival of Rafael Nadal (22 majors) and Novak Djokovic (24), began a post on social media by declaring, \u201c3 winners in Paris today,\u201d then listed Alcaraz, Sinner and \u201cthe beautiful game of tennis. What a match!\u201d",
      "This was the 12th Alcaraz-Sinner meeting, the first in a major final.",
      "\u201cHopefully not the last time,\u201d Alcaraz said. \u201cEvery time that we face ... each other, we raise our level to the top.\u201d",
      "It would be shocking if there weren\u2019t many more of these to come \u2014 perhaps as soon as at Wimbledon, where play begins on June 30 and No. 2-ranked Alcaraz is the two-time defending champion.",
      "His comeback against No. 1 Sinner from two sets down, then three championship points down, to win 4-6, 6-7 (4), 6-4, 7-6 (3), 7-6 (10-2) was unprecedented at Roland-Garros. It was unforgettable. Alcaraz's coach, Juan Carlos Ferrero, described his guy's best trait this way: \u201cHis strength is (to) keep believing all the time, until the last ball is gone.\u201d",
      "Alcaraz's five Grand Slam titles at 22 \u2014 that's the age at which Nadal, Bjorn Borg and Pete Sampras also got to five; no one's done it younger \u2014 show how special he is. So does the Spaniard's 5-0 record in major finals, a career start surpassed among men only by Federer's 7-0.",
      "Sinner is pretty good, too. Tuesday marks a full year that he has been ranked No. 1. He has reached the finals of his last eight tournaments, a run last accomplished by Djokovic a decade ago. He has won three majors. He has won 47 of his last 50 matches.",
      "Notably, all three of those losses came against \u2014 yes, you guessed it \u2014 Alcaraz. That hearkens back to the days when Federer would beat everyone other than Nadal.",
      "Sinner had claimed 31 Slam sets in a row right up until the moment he was up 2-0 against Alcaraz.",
      "What was unmistakable to anyone watching in-person at Court Philippe-Chatrier or following along from afar on TV is that Alcaraz vs. Sinner is a must-see.",
      "\u201cThe level,\u201d Alcaraz said, \u201cwas insane.\u201d",
      "Sinner's take?",
      "\u201cI\u2019m happy to be part of this,\u201d the 23-year-old Italian said. \u201cWould be even more happy if I would have ... the big trophy.\u201d",
      "As with any great rivalry \u2014 think Evert vs. Navratilova or Borg vs. McEnroe or Federer vs. Nadal, no first names needed \u2014 Alcaraz vs. Sinner provides a clash of excellence and a study in contrasts.",
      "Alcaraz displays emotion, pumping his fists, pointing to an ear to ask for more noise, yelling \u201cVamos!\u201d Sinner is rather contained. Sinner's long limbs get him to nearly every ball. Alcaraz's motor reaches speeds no one can equal. Sinner's ball-striking is pure. Alcaraz's drop shots are legendary. Both hammer groundstrokes that leave opponents exasperated and spectators gasping.",
      "Both can improve. Sinner has never won a match that lasted four hours. Alcaraz loses focus on occasion.",
      "Both are eager to improve. When Sinner returned from a three-month doping ban last month, he introduced a new, angled return stance. Alcaraz tweaked his serve and backhand technique.",
      "Who knows what heights each can reach? They split the past six Slam trophies, and eight of the past 11.",
      "Federer saw this coming.",
      "During an interview with The Associated Press in December 2019, Federer predicted someone would win major after major the way he, Nadal and Djokovic did. Just didn't know there would be a Big Two doing it.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s going to happen, inevitably,\u201d Federer said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s almost not going to be that hard, maybe ... because the players will have seen what we did. And they didn\u2019t see just one guy doing it, once every 30 years. They saw like three guys doing it, in the shortest period of time. ... Players are going to believe more.\"",

      "The Stanley Cup Final shifts to Sunrise for Game 3 on Monday night between the Florida Panthers and Edmonton Oilers",
      "SUNRISE, Fla. -- Back in the same locker room that was the scene of Connor McDavid's profanity-laced outburst and the tearful ending to his first Stanley Cup Final, the Edmonton Oilers hope they can avoid the same result this time around.",
      "Their next chance to take that step comes Monday night in Game 3 of their final rematch against the Florida Panthers, with play shifting to Sunrise after the teams split in Edmonton. The Oilers practiced in the shadow of the Panthers' championship banner and, afterwards, players stood in the same room McDavid did his post-Game 7 interview at the most disappointing moment of his NHL career.",
      "\u201cI think no matter how much time passes, it\u2019ll always be on your mind (when) you get that close,\u201d coach Kris Knoblauch said. \u201cWe\u2019re at a new stage of our season or our path, and we\u2019re just focused on what we need to do right now.\u201d",
      "The Panthers won three of their four home games in the final last year, including the first two on the way to going up 3-0 in the series. The Oilers took Games 4 and 6 in Edmonton and Game 5 at Florida before their gut-wrenching loss in Game 7.",
      "This is also not their first trip back. They got that out of the way Feb. 27 and are very familiar with the arena thanks to last June.",
      "\u201cAbsolutely, there\u2019s a comfort level in that, and there\u2019s a benefit in that,\u201d forward Connor Brown said. \u201cYou kind of know what to expect, you\u2019ve been here and so you learn from experience, too. To be able to kind of have had to earn that experience last year, I think we\u2019ll benefit from it this year.\u201d",
      "The Panthers went 27-12-2 at home during the regular season and 4-3 during the playoffs.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s never bad being in your own bed, have a nice home-cooked meal,\" Florida's Sam Reinhart said. \u201cI mean, once the puck drops, you might use the crowd a little bit. You might have that little extra energy. But at this time, it\u2019s the two best teams that are left standing. Once that puck drops, it\u2019s going to be a real battle regardless.\u201d",

      "For the Indiana Pacers, a chance at being perfect in Games 1 and 2 of these playoffs went awry",
      "OKLAHOMA CITY -- For the Indiana Pacers, a chance at being perfect in Games 1 and 2 of these playoffs went awry.",
      "They\u2019ll have to settle for a mere split of the opening two games in the NBA Finals instead.",
      "The Pacers\u2019 bid to become the fifth team in NBA history to go 8-0 to open the four playoff rounds \u2014 sweeping Games 1 and 2 in all four series \u2014 was stopped on Sunday night by the Oklahoma City Thunder. The Thunder took control early and won Game 2 123-107, tying the championship matchup at a game apiece.",
      "\u201cAny time you\u2019re the lower seed in a playoff series, you know your job is to go split or go try to get one on the road,\" Pacers guard Tyrese Haliburton said. \"We got Game 1, you know, but it felt like we really let the rope slip there in the second quarter.\u201d",
      "That they did: A 19-2 run in that second quarter put the Thunder in control \u2014 and the final margin was 16.",
      "The Pacers were trying to join the 1986 Boston Celtics, 1987 Los Angeles Lakers, 1996 Chicago Bulls and 2017 Golden State Warriors as teams that won Games 1 and 2 in all four rounds of a single postseason. All four went on to win the NBA title.",
      "Those teams all did it with home-court advantage in every one of those series. The Pacers haven\u2019t had home court since Round 1 \u2014 taking the first two of that series against Milwaukee, then winning the first two of Round 2 at Cleveland, the first two of the Eastern Conference final at New York, and Game 1 of the finals in Oklahoma City.",
      "So, in the end, the Pacers have to settle for going 7-1, tying for the fifth-best record in Games 1 and 2 in a single postseason. They also became the third team to win five of those games on the road in a playoff run.",
      "\u201cI think you want to win every game you play,\u201d Pacers forward Pascal Siakam said. \u201cSo, we are not happy with how the game went today, and that\u2019s it.\u201d",
      "Houston went 5-3 in Games 1 and 2 on the road on its way to the title in 1995 and Miami went 5-3 in road games over the first two games of series in 2023 on its way to the NBA Finals. (The Heat were 6-2 in \u201croad\u201d games in Games 1 and 2 of their series in the 2020 bubble playoffs as well, but those games were all in Lake Buena Vista, Florida.)",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not interested in talking about the past,\u201d Pacers coach Rick Carlisle said. \u201cEach day, as you are on a playoff run, is like a new day. I find that looking back is a dangerous thing. We\u2019ve got to keep our eye firmly where it needs to be.\u201d",
      "If the Pacers had won Sunday, they likely would have been overwhelming favorites heading home with a 2-0 lead. Only two teams \u2014 the 1993 Chicago Bulls and 1995 Houston Rockets \u2014 won the first two games of a finals on the road, and both went on to win the NBA title in those seasons. And teams that open the finals with a 2-0 lead go on to win the series 86.5% of the time (32 times in 37 chances).",
      "\u201cKeep our heads. We know where we\u2019re at,\u201d Pacers forward Aaron Nesmith said. \u201cWe know what we\u2019ve got to do better and just execute our game plan better.\u201d",

      "OKLAHOMA CITY -- Hall of Fame coach Don Nelson was not a fan of the Dallas Mavericks trading Luka Doncic \u2014 and chose his footwear for Game 2 of the NBA Finals accordingly.",
      "Nelson arrived for the news conference announcing him as the Chuck Daly Lifetime Achievement Award winner, as selected by the National Basketball Coaches Association, wearing a pair of Doncic's signature Jordan Brand sneaker.",
      "The reason: He was showing Doncic \u2014 who he calls \u201cmy dear friend\u201d \u2014 support.",
      "\u201cAs a matter of fact, I want everybody to know I'm wearing Luka's shoes, his new shoes from Nike that just got on the market,\u201d Nelson said. \u201cI'm wearing them in protest for the trade from Dallas. Tremendous mistake by the Dallas franchise to trade him and I want everybody to know that.\u201d",
      "Doncic was traded by Dallas to the Los Angeles Lakers this season for Anthony Davis, a blockbuster that the entire league found stunning. Fans in Dallas were furious for months, though some of that seems to have subsided in recent weeks with the Mavericks winning draft lottery and the chance to draft Cooper Flagg No. 1 overall later this month.",
      "Nelson said his philosophy on generational players is the one that Red Auerbach taught him: Don't trade those talents.",

You put his number up and you honor that player. That\u2019s been my philosophy.\u201d",
      "Nelson has deep ties to Dallas, so his reaction to the Doncic trade is understandable. He coached the Mavericks for eight seasons and his son, Donnie Nelson, was an executive with Dallas from 2005 through 2021.",

      "That made him far richer than he could have imagined when he was raised in poverty in the Philippines. He went on to serve his country as a senator from 2016-22 and ran unsuccessfully for president, and his voice broke a bit as he thanked his fans from home along with his family.",

      "ANAHEIM, Calif. -- George Kirby struck out a career-high 14 during seven innings of two-hit ball, and the Seattle Mariners snapped their five-game losing streak with a 3-2 victory over the Los Angeles Angels on Sunday.",
      "Kirby (1-3) issued no walks while retiring both his first 11 and his final 10 batters. His strikeouts were the most by a Mariners pitcher since James Paxton had 16 in May 2018, and he matched Miami's Max Meyer for the most strikeouts in a major league game this season.",
      "Donovan Solano drove in the go-ahead run in the fifth, and Randy Arozarena had an early RBI double among his three hits as the Mariners avoided a series sweep with their fourth win in 14 games.",
      "Taylor Ward hit a two-run homer in the fourth for the Halos, who struck out 18 times overall while losing for only the second time in six games.",
      "Andr\u00e9s Mu\u00f1oz earned his 18th save, returning from a week off and rebounding from back-to-back blown save opportunities in which he allowed his first earned runs of the entire season.",
      "Mu\u00f1oz walked Jorge Soler leading off the ninth, but struck out Mike Trout to end it.",
      "Tyler Anderson (2-3) yielded eight hits with six strikeouts while pitching into the fifth inning of his ninth consecutive winless appearance.",
      "Arozarena hit a 345-foot single in the fifth when he failed to hustle out of the box, but he stole second and scored on Jorge Polanco's two-out single. Solano added another RBI single to chase Anderson.",
      "Trout was the Angels\u2019 first baserunner with a two-out single, and Ward immediately followed with his 18th homer. Kirby regrouped and struck out Chris Taylor with a perfect slider on the corner.",
      "Trout tied Rafael Palmeiro's major league record of 435 total bases against Seattle before scoring his 145th run against the Mariners to tie Rickey Henderson for that career record.",
      "Yusei Kikuchi (1-5, 3.23 ERA) takes the Big A mound Monday night against the Athletics. Emerson Hancock (2-2, 5.19) pitches for the Mariners at Arizona.",

      "Despite losing 14 of 17, the Braves have been outscored by just eight runs (72-64) during that span. Sunday's loss was their eighth loss in the stretch by one run.",

      "England won the second Twenty20 cricket international against West Indies by four wickets with nine balls remaining to take an insurmountable 2-0 lead in the three-match series. England scored 199-6 in 18.3 overs after West Indies lost the toss and posted 196.",
      "Brook has won five in a row against the West Indies since taking over from Jos Buttler, including a 3-0 sweep in the ODI matches.",
      "England didn't have it easy at Bristol, with the asking rate climbing past 11 per over at one stage as it chased down West Indies' target.",
      "But the team stuck together to get over the line, with five of the top six batters making handy contributions before Jacob Bethell (26) and Tom Banton (30 not out) hammered 56 off just 21 deliveries between them to puncture the West Indian resistance. Buttler again top scored for England with 47 off 36 deliveries. He hit 96 when England beat West Indies by 21 runs in the series opener on Friday.",
      "It was the kind of game England was tending to lose in the difficult final days under Buttler, whose captaincy ended with eight straight defeats across both white ball formats.",
      "After dominating the West Indies in three one-day internationals, England was expected to receive a tougher contest from the visitors, who are higher-rated in T20s than ODIs.",
      "West Indies smashed 47 runs off the last two overs of its innings, including 31 runs in the 19th over against spinner Adil Rashid, with his six deliveries going for 6-6-6-1-6-6. Jason Holder (29 not out) hit the first three sixes and Romario Shepherd added the last two.",
      "Skipper Shai Hope was top scorer for West Indies with a 38-ball 49, including four sixes. He shared an 89-run partnership for the second wicket with Johnson Charles after opener Evin Lewis was trapped lbw to Luke Wood (2-25 in four overs) on the first ball of the match. Charles hit three sixes and three fours in his 39-ball 47 before he was bowled by Wood.",
      "West Indies had No. 2-ranked T20 bowler Akeal Hosein (1-33) back with them on Sunday. Hosein missed the first T20 as he was unable to travel to England in time because of recent changes to Britain's visa entry requirements for Trinidad and Tobago citizens.",

      "The second consecutive Stanley Cup Final between the Florida Panthers and Edmonton Oilers has been about as even as a series can get through two games, with each winning one in overtime",
      "SUNRISE, Fla. -- After going the distance in the Stanley Cup Final last year with the Florida Panthers beating the Edmonton Oilers by a goal in Game 7 and being one win apart during the regular season, not much is separating these two NHL powerhouses so far in their championship series rematch.",
      "This final is just about as close as can be through two games, with each team winning once in overtime and knowing full well one puck off the post or into the net could have dramatically changed the situation. That remains the case going into Game 3 on Monday night at Florida, with the very real chance that a couple of bounces and small adjustments could tilt the series one way or the other.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s just the back-and-forth punches of a heavyweight tilt,\" veteran Oilers forward Adam Henrique said after practice Sunday. \u201cEvery shift matters so much because it might be a 1-0 game and a 2-1 game, and those mistakes that could either cost you or pay dividends for you and keeping that pressure high \u2014 that can be the difference.\u201d",
      "This has been a different final than many in the recent past, in part because there's no underdog in it who no one expected to get this far, the opponents know each other well and the teams are nearly at full strength. That has made for some quality hockey where the goals have piled up and yet the defense and goaltending have at the same time been stellar.",
      "\u201cEverything is contested all over the ice, so you\u2019re having more events and it\u2019s more intense, but what a wonderful thing to be able to say that in the final,\u201d Panthers coach Paul Maurice said after his team's optional skate in Fort Lauderdale. \u201cBoth teams are competing defensively. They\u2019re blocking shots, they\u2019re battling, they\u2019re backchecking and it\u2019s still a high-event game. That\u2019s some high-end skill.\u201d",
      "That high-end skill has been on display. Three-time league and reigning playoff MVP Connor McDavid fittingly leads all scorers with five points, and longtime Edmonton running mate Leon Draisaitl has matched Florida's Sam Bennett and Brad Marchand at three goals apiece.",
      "Game 1 finished 4-3 in overtime and Game 2 was 5-4 in double OT. The Oilers have more shots, 92 to 74, while the Panthers have led for over 67 minutes compared to trailing for nearly 28 minutes.",
      "It has been tied for large swaths of regulation, and for all the offense, players acknowledge there has not been a whole lot of ice with which to operate.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s very tight,\" said Marchand, who scored the Game 2 winner 8:04 into the second overtime. \"You can\u2019t make any mistakes. Just every time you do, they seem to get something off of it. And we\u2019re obviously balanced throughout the lineup, so it\u2019s very tight out there. The games speak for themselves. It\u2019s been a battle. Very intense and a lot of fun to be a part of.\u201d",
      "Like Maurice did after his team lost the opener, Oilers coach Kris Knoblauch is making some changes going on the road where he does not control the matchups. He jumbled his defense pairs, putting Evan Bouchard with Darnell Nurse, Mattias Ekholm with John Klingberg, and Brett Kulak with Jake Walman.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re always making adjustments to counter whatever teams are doing, who\u2019s playing well,\u201d Knoblauch said. \u201cFortunately, our players are comfortable with any changes that we do make just because of how much we\u2019ve fluctuated our pairs and lines throughout the season. In Games 1 and 2 we had some changes, and games throughout the rest of the series there\u2019ll be some more.\u201d",
      "The push and pull has been quite something to behold. Tune in to just one period or a handful of shifts and it's easy to get the idea that one team or the other is dominating, and then not long after it alternates.",
      "\u201cBoth teams will have times where they look like they\u2019ve got possession of the game, but it\u2019s just not going to last. It doesn't last,\u201d Maurice said. \u201cThis is so close out there, so you can take a look at that video and I can find you 15 goals for the Edmonton Oilers that just didn\u2019t go in, and I can find you the exact same for the Florida Panthers.\u201d",
      "The emotional ebbs and flows, Maurice insists, are also not as big of swings as it looks from the outside. He didn't feel as devastated after the Game 1 defeat or as euphoric after the Game 2 triumph as it may have appeared.",
      "His players are accustomed to these waves from losing in the final to Vegas in 2023 and winning in seven games a year ago after surrendering a 3-0 series lead.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s all about staying in the moment,\u201d Panthers winger Sam Reinhart said. \u201cYou can\u2019t think too far ahead, and you can\u2019t think too far in the past.\u201d",
      "Draisaitl, who scored the Game 1 OT goal, acknowledged the what-ifs creep into players' heads in the immediate aftermath of a difficult result. But he and his teammates and their counterparts on the other side understand they can't dwell too much given the razor thin margin of error.",
      "\u201cTwo really good teams going at it,\u201d Draisaitl said. \"You have to stay detailed and know that all those little bounces matter.\u201d",

      "Cauley and Young had made it through 36-hole qualifying last Monday, so their spots went to Chase Johnson and Eric Cole, who also had played in the Columbus, Ohio, qualifier. Cole was the second alternate in Columbus but got the spot because that's where Cauley and Young were.",

He also did plenty of chipping and putting. On one hole, he had his caddie throw him golf balls down into the bunker. The grass was so thick it gobbled up the balls before they reached to the sand.",
      "The rough was as advertised, mainly the sheer density of it, and it was made even more difficult considering how wet it was.",
      "Spieth wasn't worried so much about the grass off the fairway \u2014 everyone has to deal with that at some point during the U.S. Open. It was what followed.",
      "\u201cIt magnifies once you make a mistake if you don't play the right shot,\" he said. \u201cIt's not like making a mistake is the end of the world. It might cost you half a shot. You just have to take what it gives you.\u201d",
      "More than 60 players in the U.S. Open field were at the Memorial two weeks ago, which also featured rough that was longer and thicker than normal. Growing grass has not been an issue in the Ohio Valley this year. The difference is the speed of Oakmont's greens \u2014 reputed to be the fastest in the land \u2014 and not many forced carries.",
      "\u201cThis test here, because they give you more runways to try to run it up to the green, it entices you to think you can do more than you should,\u201d Spieth said. \u201cThat will be the biggest challenge this week \u2014 swallowing pride. Bogeys don't hurt you. Anything more will.\u201d",
      "The forecast was for more scattered showers on Monday, and then a break from the rain until the weekend.",
      "Oakmont is hosting the U.S. Open for a record 10th time, and its reputation is strong enough that even the best can expect a strong test. First impressions, of course, can be misleading.",
      "Shane Lowry recalls seeing it for the first time on the Sunday before the 2016 U.S. Open. He started on No. 10, played five holes and walked in, wondering how he could ever manage a decent score around Oakmont. A week later, he went into the final round with a four-shot lead.",
      "\u201cIt was firm and fast when I played it that Sunday, and it was windy. We got a bit of rain that week, which helped us,\u201d Lowry recalled.",
      "The flip side was Adam Scott. He first played Oakmont the week before 2007 U.S. Open with Geoff Ogilvy, who was the defending U.S. Open champion that year.",
      "\u201cI played really great that day and Geoff didn't, so I was feeling really chipper about myself,\u201d Scott said. He returned a week later feeling confident as ever.",
      "\u201cI hit six greens in two days and flew back to Australia,\u201d he said. \u201cIt really hit me hard.\u201d",

      "Nintendo's Switch 2 video-game console is out, and it makes some substantial improvements over its predecessor",
      "WASHINGTON -- I'm cruising around Bowser's Castle with my old pal Toad. It's not exactly relaxing, what with all the lava pits and banana peels and turtle shells littering the road. Add 23 other characters \u2014 is that a cow driving? \u2014 who are trying to get to the finish line first, and it's chaos.",
      "The hectic, high-speed insanity of any race in the new Mario Kart World would have caused the eight-year-old Switch console to wheeze a bit. And that's why we've got the Switch 2 ($449.99), the souped-up sequel to Nintendo's popular home-and-portable hybrid.",
      "It looks prettier, too. The 7.9-inch portable display (up from 6.2 inches) boosts the resolution to 1020p (from 720p), and while the LCD screen isn't quite as sharp as an OLED screen might have been, it's much cleaner than the original recipe Switch. It looks even better when connected to an HDTV since it now supports 4K and HDR.",
      "Nintendo has always stood apart from the technological arms race that fans of Sony\u2019s PlayStation and Microsoft\u2019s Xbox obsess over, insisting that first-rate games don\u2019t necessarily depend on high-powered computer chips. But you could feel the strain in 2023\u2019s The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, with its at-times blurry graphics and sluggish framerate. The Switch 2, with a faster framerate of 120 fps, corrects much of the fuzziness.",
      "That's not to say it comes close to matching the high-definition performance of the PlayStation 5 or the Xbox X/S. If you're expecting the jaw-dropping graphics of, say, Ubisoft's Assassin's Creed Shadows ... well, no.",
      "There is good news for those of us who have gotten weary of the old Switch's dinky 32 gigabytes of internal storage. The Switch 2 multiplies that by eight, for 256 GB. Of course, flashier games take up more space, so if you want more room you'll have to invest in a microSD Express card \u2014 which is a bit pricier than the standard memory card used in most portable devices.",
      "The Switch 2's Joy-Con controllers have undergone some tinkering. As before, you can attach them to the sides of the screen if you're playing on the go. If you're at home, you can attach them to a doohickey that feels more like a traditional joystick. Either way, they're now more firmly connected with magnets, which provide a satisfying snap.",
      "Both the left and right Joy-Cons now include an optical mouse, which you can use by placing the controller on its edge and rolling it around on a table. (Nintendo says you can also use it on your pants, but I prefer using a clipboard on my lap.) It remains to be seen how many Switch 2 games will call for a mouse, but 2K's port of Sid Meier's Civilization VII seems like a good candidate.",
      "And then there's a new button labeled \u201cC\u201d on the right-hand Joy-Con. That calls up GameChat, which lets you start up a conversation with other players \u2014 provided you've all taken the time to register yourselves as friends. (Eventually, you'll also need to subscribe to the Nintendo Switch Online service, but that requirement doesn't kick in until March 31, 2026.) The microphone is built into the Switch 2, though if you want to upgrade to video chat, you'll need to buy a separate Nintendo camera.",
      "Finally, there\u2019s GameShare, which lets you play selected titles with other Switch users even if they don\u2019t own the software.",
      "Nintendo has been emphasizing the new social features in its marketing, though it feels like it's catching up to the competition. The kids I know who play Fortnite or Minecraft on competing consoles seem to have figured out long ago how to chat with their pals. Welcome to the 2010s?",
      "As with any console launch, the driving question is: Does it have the games?",
      "There are just a couple of Switch 2 exclusives out now: Mario Kart World and Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour, a $10 demo package that really should have been free. There are some new-to-Nintendo ports of excellent titles like Split Fiction and Cyberpunk 2077. You can get upgrades of classics like the last two Legend of Zelda adventures. And the Switch 2 is fully backward-compatible, so you can play everything that came out for the Switch as well as a substantial library of older titles.",
      "There\u2019s no other machine that will let you play future installments of beloved franchises like Zelda, Super Mario Bros., Super Smash Bros. and Animal Crossing. None of those have been announced yet, but some marquee names \u2014 Donkey Kong and Kirby \u2014 will star in Switch 2 exclusives later this year.",
      "There\u2019s plenty of competition out there, though, and not just in the TV-connected console market Switch shares with the PlayStation and the Xbox. Nintendo no longer has the portable market to itself, thanks to Valve\u2019s SteamDeck. Some models of that device cost less than the Switch 2, and it already has a huge library of PC games. Meanwhile, Microsoft announced over the weekend that it's teaming up with Asus on the ROG Xbox Ally, a handheld that will be out before Christmas.",
      "Honestly, we\u2019ll probably have a better idea of the Switch\u2019s quality a few years down the line, after developers get a handle on what the new hardware can do. If you\u2019re dying to get back behind the wheel with Mario, Luigi and Princess Peach right now, though, you know what you need to do.",
      "\u2014\u2014",
      "A previous version of this story was corrected to say that the Switch 2 social options can be used without a subscription until March 31, 2026.",

      "In a statement, Gov. Josh Shapiro called it the largest capital investment in Pennsylvania's history.",
      "The announcements add to the billions of dollars in Big Tech's data center cash already flowing into the state.",
      "Since 2024 started, Amazon has committed to about $10 billion apiece to data center projects in Mississippi, Indiana, Ohio and North Carolina as it ramps up its investment in infrastructure to compete with other tech giants to meet growing demand for artificial intelligence products.",
      "The rapid growth of cloud computing and artificial intelligence has fueled demand for data centers that need power to run servers, storage systems, networking equipment and cooling systems.",
      "The majority owner of the Susquehanna nuclear power plant, Talen Energy, announced last year that it had sold its data center to Amazon for $650 million in a deal to eventually provide 960 megawatts. That's 40% of the output of one of the nation's largest nuclear power plants, or enough to power more than a half-million homes.",
      "However, the arrangement between Talen and Amazon \u2014 called a \u201cbehind the meter\u201d connection \u2014 has been held up by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in the first such case to come before the agency.",
      "It has raised questions over whether diverting power to higher-paying customers will leave enough for others and whether it\u2019s fair to excuse big power users from paying for the grid.",
      "For Big Tech, plugging energy-hungry data centers directly into a power plant can take years off their development timelines and is a much faster route to procuring power than having to connect to the congested electricity grid.",
      "It\u2019s not clear when FERC, which blocked the deal on a procedural grounds, will decide the matter, leaving in limbo regulatory treatment of the deal and others that likely would follow.",
      "Already in Pennsylvania, Microsoft announced a deal with the owner of the shuttered Three Mile Island nuclear power plant to restart the reactor under a 20-year agreement to supply its data centers in four states with energy.",
      "Meanwhile, the owners of what was once Pennsylvania\u2019s biggest coal-fired power plant say they will turn it into a $10 billion natural gas-powered data center campus.",

      "After stumbling out of the starting gate in Big Tech\u2019s pivotal race to create artificial intelligence, Apple will try to regain its footing Monday with its annual showcase for the next generation of software powering the iPhone and other popular products",
      "After stumbling out of the starting gate in Big Tech's pivotal race to capitalize on artificial intelligence, Apple will try to regain its footing Monday at its annual Worldwide Developers Conference.",
      "The presummer rite, which attracts thousands of developers to Apple's Silicon Valley headquarters, is expected to be more subdued than the feverish anticipation that surrounded the event during the previous two years.",
      "In 2023, Apple unveiled a mixed-reality headset that has been little more than a niche product, and last year WWDC trumpeted its first major foray into the AI craze with an array of new features highlighted by the promise of a smarter and more versatile version of its virtual assistant, Siri.",
      "But heading into this year's showcase, Apple faces nagging questions about whether the nearly 50-year-old company has lost some of the mystique and innovative drive that turned it into a tech trendsetter. Instead of making a big splash as it did with the Vision Pro headset, Apple this year is expected to focus on an overhaul of its software that may include a new, more tactile look for the iPhone's native apps and a new nomenclature for identifying its operating system updates.",
      "Even though it might look like Apple is becoming a technological laggard, Forrester Research analyst Thomas Husson contends the company still has ample time to catch up in an AI race that's \u201cmore of a marathon, than a sprint. It will force Apple to evolve its operating systems.\u201d",
      "If reports about its iOS naming scheme pan out, Apple will switch to a method that automakers have used to telegraph their latest car models by linking them to the year after they first arrive at dealerships. That would mean the next version of the iPhone operating system due out this autumn will be known as iOS 26 instead of iOS 19 \u2014 as it would be under the current sequential naming approach.",
      "Whatever it's named, the next iOS will likely be released as a free update in September, around the same time as the next iPhone models if Apple follows its usual road map.",
      "Meanwhile, Apple's references to AI may be less frequent than last year when the technology was the main attraction.",
      "While some of the new AI tricks compatible with the latest iPhones began rolling out late last year as part of free software updates, Apple still hasn't been able to soup up Siri in the ways that it touted at last year's conference. The delays became so glaring that a chastened Apple retreated from promoting Siri in its AI marketing campaigns earlier this year.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s just taking a bit longer than we thought,\u201d Apple CEO Tim Cook told analysts last month when asked about the company's headaches with Siri. \u201cBut we are making progress, and we\u2019re extremely excited to get the more personal Siri features out there.\u201d",
      "While Apple has been struggling to make AI that meets its standards, the gap separating it from other tech powerhouses is widening. Google keeps packing more AI into its Pixel smartphone lineup while introducing more of the technology into its search engine to dramatically change the way it works. Samsung, Apple's biggest smartphone rival, is also leaning heavily into AI. Meanwhile, ChatGPT recently struck a deal that will bring former Apple design guru Jony Ive into the fold to work on a new device expected to compete against the iPhone.",
      "\u201cWhile much of WWDC will be about what the next great thing is for the iPhone, the unspoken question is: What's the next great thing after the iPhone?\u201d said Dipanjan Chatterjee, another analyst for Forrester Research.",
      "Besides facing innovation challenges, Apple also faces regulatory threats that could siphon away billions of dollars in revenue that help finance its research and development. A federal judge is currently weighing whether proposed countermeasures to Google's illegal monopoly in search should include a ban on long-running deals worth $20 billion annually to Apple while another federal judge recently banned the company from collecting commission on in-app transactions processed outside its once-exclusive payment system.",
      "On top of all that, Apple has been caught in the cross-hairs of President Donald Trump's trade war with China, a key manufacturing hub for the Cupertino, California, company. Cook successfully persuaded Trump to exempt the iPhone from tariffs during the president's first administration, but he has had less success during Trump's second term, which seems more determined to prod Apple to make its products in the U.S..",
      "\u201cThe trade war and uncertainty linked to the tariff policy is of much more concern today for Apple\u2019s business than the perception that Apple is lagging behind on AI innovation,\u201d Husson said.",
      "The multi-dimensional gauntlet facing Apple is spooking investors, causing the company's stock price to plunge by nearly 20% so far this year \u2014 a decline that has erased $750 billion in shareholder wealth. After beginning the year as the most valuable company in the world, Apple now ranks third behind longtime rival Microsoft, another AI leader, and AI chipmaker Nvidia.",

      "Hackers tied to China's government have tried repeatedly to access the phones of prominent Americans, part of Beijing's sprawling cyberespionage efforts",
      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014",
      "Cybersecurity investigators noticed a highly unusual software crash \u2014 it was affecting a small number of smartphones belonging to people who worked in government, politics, tech and journalism.",
      "The crashes, which began late last year and carried into 2025, were the tipoff to a sophisticated cyberattack that may have allowed hackers to infiltrate a phone without a single click from the user.",
      "The attackers left no clues about their identities, but investigators at the cybersecurity firm iVerify noticed that the victims all had something in common: They worked in fields of interest to China's government and had been targeted by Chinese hackers in the past.",
      "Foreign hackers have increasingly identified smartphones, other mobile devices and the apps they use as a weak link in U.S. cyberdefenses. Groups linked to China's military and intelligence service have targeted the smartphones of prominent Americans and burrowed deep into telecommunication networks, according to national security and tech experts.",
      "It shows how vulnerable mobile devices and apps are and the risk that security failures could expose sensitive information or leave American interests open to cyberattack, those experts say.",
      "\u201cThe world is in a mobile security crisis right now,\u201d said Rocky Cole, a former cybersecurity expert at the National Security Agency and Google and now chief operations officer at iVerify. \u201cNo one is watching the phones.\u201d",
      "U.S. authorities warned in December of a sprawling Chinese hacking campaign designed to gain access to the texts and phone conversations of an unknown number of Americans.",
      "\u201cThey were able to listen in on phone calls in real time and able to read text messages,\u201d said Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi of Illinois. He is a member of the House Intelligence Committee and the senior Democrat on the Committee on the Chinese Communist Party, created to study the geopolitical threat from China.",
      "Chinese hackers also sought access to phones used by Donald Trump and running mate JD Vance during the 2024 campaign.",
      "The Chinese government has denied allegations of cyberespionage, and accused the U.S. of mounting its own cyberoperations. It says America cites national security as an excuse to issue sanctions against Chinese organizations and keep Chinese technology companies from the global market.",
      "\u201cThe U.S. has long been using all kinds of despicable methods to steal other countries\u2019 secrets,\u201d Lin Jian, a spokesman for China\u2019s foreign ministry, said at a recent press conference in response to questions about a CIA push to recruit Chinese informants.",
      "U.S. intelligence officials have said China poses a significant, persistent threat to U.S. economic and political interests, and it has harnessed the tools of digital conflict: online propaganda and disinformation, artificial intelligence and cyber surveillance and espionage designed to deliver a significant advantage in any military conflict.",
      "Mobile networks are a top concern. The U.S. and many of its closest allies have banned Chinese telecom companies from their networks. Other countries, including Germany, are phasing out Chinese involvement because of security concerns. But Chinese tech firms remain a big part of the systems in many nations, giving state-controlled companies a global footprint they could exploit for cyberattacks, experts say.",
      "Chinese telecom firms still maintain some routing and cloud storage systems in the U.S. \u2014 a growing concern to lawmakers.",
      "\u201cThe American people deserve to know if Beijing is quietly using state-owned firms to infiltrate our critical infrastructure,\u201d U.S. Rep. John Moolenaar, R-Mich. and chairman of the China committee, which in April issued subpoenas to Chinese telecom companies seeking information about their U.S. operations.",
      "Mobile devices can buy stocks, launch drones and run power plants. Their proliferation has often outpaced their security.",
      "The phones of top government officials are especially valuable, containing sensitive government information, passwords and an insider's glimpse into policy discussions and decision-making.",
      "The White House said last week that someone impersonating Susie Wiles, Trump\u2019s chief of staff, reached out to governors, senators and business leaders with texts and phone calls.",
      "It\u2019s unclear how the person obtained Wiles\u2019 connections, but they apparently gained access to the contacts in her personal cellphone, The Wall Street Journal reported. The messages and calls were not coming from Wiles\u2019 number, the newspaper reported.",
      "While most smartphones and tablets come with robust security, apps and connected devices often lack these protections or the regular software updates needed to stay ahead of new threats. That makes every fitness tracker, baby monitor or smart appliance another potential foothold for hackers looking to penetrate networks, retrieve information or infect systems with malware.",
      "Federal officials launched a program this year creating a \u201ccyber trust mark\u201d for connected devices that meet federal security standards. But consumers and officials shouldn\u2019t lower their guard, said Snehal Antani, former chief technology officer for the Pentagon\u2019s Joint Special Operations Command.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re finding backdoors in Barbie dolls,\u201d said Antani, now CEO of Horizon3.ai, a cybersecurity firm, referring to concerns from researchers who successfully hacked the microphone of a digitally connected version of the toy.",
      "It doesn't matter how secure a mobile device is if the user doesn't follow basic security precautions, especially if their device contains classified or sensitive information, experts say.",
      "Mike Waltz, who departed as Trump's national security adviser, inadvertently added The Atlantic's editor-in-chief to a Signal chat used to discuss military plans with other top officials.",
      "Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth had an internet connection that bypassed the Pentagon\u2019s security protocols set up in his office so he could use the Signal messaging app on a personal computer, the AP has reported.",
      "Hegseth has rejected assertions that he shared classified information on Signal, a popular encrypted messaging app not approved for the use of communicating classified information.",
      "China and other nations will try to take advantage of such lapses, and national security officials must take steps to prevent them from recurring, said Michael Williams, a national security expert at Syracuse University.",

      "A new study that examined five years\u2019 worth of prices at one U.S. grocery chain found that digital price tags haven\u2019t led to demand-based pricing surges",
      "Digital price labels, which are rapidly replacing paper shelf tags at U.S. supermarkets, haven\u2019t led to demand-based pricing surges, according to a new study that examined five years' worth of prices at one grocery chain.",
      "But some shoppers, consumer advocates and lawmakers remain skeptical about the tiny electronic screens, which let stores change prices instantly from a central computer instead of having workers swap out paper labels by hand.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s corporations vs. the humans, and that chasm between us goes further and further,\u201d said Dan Gallant, who works in sports media in Edmonton, Canada. Gallant's local Loblaws supermarket recently switched to digital labels.",
      "Social media is filled with warnings that grocers will use the technology to charge more for ice cream if it\u2019s hot outside, hike the price of umbrellas if it\u2019s raining or to gather information about customers.",
      "Democratic U.S. Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Bob Casey of Pennsylvania fired off a letter to Kroger last fall demanding to know whether it would use its electronic labels as part of a dynamic pricing strategy.",
      "Lawmakers in Rhode Island and Maine have introduced bills to limit the use of digital labels. In Arizona, Democratic state Rep. Cesar Aguilar recently introduced a bill that would ban them altogether.",
      "The bill hasn\u2019t gotten a hearing, but Aguilar said he\u2019s determined to start a conversation about digital labels and how stores could abuse them.",
      "\u201cGrocery stores study when people go shopping the most. And so you might be able to see a price go down one day and then go up another day,\u201d Aguilar told The Associated Press.",
      "Researchers say those fears are misplaced. A study published in late May found \u201cvirtually no surge pricing\u201d before or after electronic shelf labels were adopted. The study was authored by Ioannis Stamatopoulos of the University of Texas, Austin, Robert Evan Sanders of the University of California, San Diego and Robert Bray of Northwestern University",
      "The researchers looked at prices between 2019 and 2024 at an unnamed grocery chain than began using digital labels in October 2022. They found that temporary price increases affected 0.005% of products on any given day before electronic shelf labels were introduced, a share that increased by only 0.0006 percentage points after digital labels were installed.",
      "The study also determined that discounts were slightly more common after digital labels were introduced.",
      "Economists have long wondered why grocery prices don\u2019t change more often, according to Stamatopoulos. If bananas are about to expire, for example, it makes sense to lower the price on them. He said the cost of having workers change prices by hand could be one issue.",
      "But there\u2019s another reason: Shoppers watch grocery prices closely, and stores don\u2019t want to risk angering them.",
      "\u201cSelling groceries is not selling a couch. It\u2019s not a one-time transaction and you will never see them again,\u201d Stamatopoulos said. \u201cYou want them coming to the store every week.\u201d",
      "Electronic price labels aren\u2019t new. They\u2019ve been in use for more than a decade at groceries in Europe and some U.S. retailers, like Kohl's.",
      "But they\u2019ve been slow to migrate to U.S. grocery stores. Only around 5% to 10% of U.S. supermarkets now have electronic labels, compared to 80% in Europe, said Amanda Oren, vice president of industry strategy for North American grocery at Relex Solutions, a technology company that helps retailers forecast demand.",
      "Oren said cost is one issue that has slowed the U.S. rollout. The tiny screens cost between $5 and $20, Oren said, but every product a store sells needs one, and the average supermarket has 100,000 or more individual products.",
      "Still, the U.S. industry is charging ahead. Walmart, the nation's largest grocer and retailer, hopes to have digital price labels at 2,300 U.S. stores by 2026. Kroger is expanding the use of digital labels this year after testing them at 20 stores. Whole Foods is testing the labels in nearly 50 stores.",
      "Companies say electronic price labels have tremendous advantages. Walmart says it used to take employees two days to change paper price labels on the 120,000 items it has in a typical store. With digital tags, it takes a few minutes.",
      "The labels can also be useful. Some have codes shoppers can scan to see recipes or nutrition information. Instacart has a system in thousands of U.S. stores, including Aldi and Schnucks, that flashes a light on the digital tag when Instacart shoppers are nearby to help them find products.",
      "Ahold Delhaize\u2019s Albert Heijn supermarket chain in the Netherlands and Belgium has been testing an artificial intelligence-enabled tool since 2022 that marks down prices on its digital labels every 15 minutes for products nearing expiration. The system has reduced more than 250 tons of food waste annually, the company said.",
      "But Warren and Casey are skeptical. In their letter to Kroger, the U.S. senators noted a partnership with Microsoft that planned to put cameras in grocery aisles and offer personalized deals to shoppers depending on their gender and age.",
      "In its response, Kroger said the prices shown on its digital labels were not connected to any sort of facial recognition technology. It also denied surging prices during periods of peak demand.",
      "\u201cKroger\u2019s business model is built on a foundation of lowering prices to attract more customers,\u201d the company said.",
      "Aguilar, the Arizona lawmaker, said he also opposes the transition to digital labels because he thinks they will cost jobs. His constituents have pointed out that grocery prices keep rising even though there are fewer workers in checkout lanes, he said.",
      "\u201cThey are supposed to be part of our community, and that means hiring people from our community that fill those jobs,\" Aguilar said.",
      "But Relex Solutions' Oren said she doesn't think cutting labor costs is the main reason stores deploy digital price tags.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s about working smarter, not harder, and being able to use that labor in better ways across the store rather than these very mundane, repetitive tasks,\u201d she said.",

      "NEW YORK -- The world\u2019s richest man could lose billions in his fight with world\u2019s most powerful politician.",
      "The feud between Elon Musk and Donald Trump could mean Tesla\u2019s plans for self-driving cars hit a roadblock, SpaceX flies fewer missions for NASA, Starlink gets fewer overseas satellite contracts and the social media platform X loses advertisers.",
      "Maybe, that is. It all depends on Trump\u2019s appetite for revenge and how the dispute unfolds.",
      "Joked Telemetry Insight auto analyst Sam Abuelsamid, \u201cSince Trump has no history of retaliating against perceived adversaries, he\u2019ll probably just let this pass.\u201d",
      "Turning serious, he sees trouble ahead for Musk.",
      "\u201cFor someone that rants so much about government pork, all of Elon\u2019s businesses are extremely dependent on government largesse, which makes him vulnerable.\u201d",
      "Trump and the federal government also stand to lose from a long-running dispute, but not as much as Musk.",
      "The dispute comes just a week before a planned test of Tesla\u2019s driverless taxis in Austin, Texas, a major event for the company because sales of its EVs are lagging in many markets, and Musk needs a win.",
      "Trump can mess things up for Tesla by encouraging federal safety regulators to step in at any sign of trouble for the robotaxis.",
      "Even before the war of words broke out on Thursday, the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration requested data on how Musk\u2019s driverless, autonomous taxis will perform in low-visibility conditions. That request follows an investigation last year into 2.4 million Teslas equipped with full self-driving software after several accidents, including one that killed a pedestrian.",
      "A spokesman for NHTSA said the probe was ongoing and that the agency \"will take any necessary actions to protect road safety.\u201d",
      "The Department of Justice has also probed the safety of Tesla cars, but the status of that investigation is unclear. The DOJ did not respond immediately to requests for comment.",
      "The promise of a self-driving future led by Tesla inspired shareholders to boost the stock by 50% in the weeks after Musk confirmed the Austin rollout. But on Thursday, the stock plunged more than 14% amid the Trump-Musk standoff. On Friday, it recovered a bit, bouncing back nearly 4%.",
      "\u201cTesla\u2019s recent rise was almost entirely driven by robotaxi enthusiasm,\" said Morningstar analyst Seth Goldstein. \u201cElon\u2019s feud with Trump could be a negative.\u201d",
      "One often-overlooked but important part of Tesla\u2019s business that could take a hit is its sales of carbon credits.",
      "As Musk and Trump were slugging it out Thursday, Republican senators inserted new language into Trump\u2019s budget bill that would eliminate fines for gas-powered cars that fall short of fuel economy standards. Tesla has a thriving side business selling \u201cregulatory credits\u201d to other automakers to make up for their shortfalls.",
      "Musk has downplayed the importance of the credits business, but the changes would hurt Tesla as it reels from boycotts of its cars tied to Musk\u2019s time working for Trump.",
      "Credit sales jumped by a third to $595 million in the first three months of the year even as total revenue slumped.",
      "Musk\u2019s foray into right-wing politics cost Tesla sales among the environmentally minded consumers who embraced electric cars and led to boycotts of Tesla showrooms.",
      "If Musk has indeed ended his close association with Trump, those buyers could come back, but that\u2019s far from certain.",
      "Meanwhile, one analyst speculated earlier this year that Trump voters in so-called red counties could buy Teslas \u201cin a meaningful way.\u201d But he\u2019s now less hopeful.",
      "\u201cThere are more questions than answers following Thursday developments,\u201d TD Cowen\u2019s Itay Michaeli wrote in his latest report, \u201cand it\u2019s still too early to determine any lasting impacts.\u201d",

      "The privately held company that is reportedly worth $350 billion provides launches, sends astronauts into space for NASA and has a contract to send a team from the space agency to the moon next year.",
      "But if Musk has a lot to lose, so does the U.S.",
      "SpaceX is the only U.S. company capable of transporting crews to and from the space station, using its four-person Dragon capsules. The other alternative is politically dicey: depending wholly on Russia's Soyuz capsules.",
      "Musk knew all this when he shot back at Trump that SpaceX would begin decommissioning its Dragon spacecraft. But it is unclear how serious his threat was. Several hours later \u2014 in a reply to another X user \u2014 he said he wouldn\u2019t do it.",

      "Artificial Intelligence\u2019s use in filmmaking is growing",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Artificial intelligence 's use in movie making is exploding. And a young film festival, now in its junior year, is showcasing what this technology can do on screen today.",
      "The annual AI Film Festival organized by Runway, a company that specializes in AI-generated video, kicked off in New York Thursday night with ten short films from around the world making their debut on the big screen.",
      "\u201cThree years ago, this was such a crazy idea,\u201d Runway CEO Crist\u00f3bal Valenzuela told the crowd. \u201cToday, millions of people are making billions of videos using tools we only dreamed of.\u201d",
      "The film festival itself has grown significantly since its 2023 debut. About 300 people submitted films when it first began, Valenzuela said, compared to about 6,000 submissions received this year.",
      "The one and half-hour lineup stretched across a range of creative styles and ambitious themes \u2014 with Jacob Alder's \u201c Total Pixel Space \" taking home the festival's top prize. The 9-minute and 28-second film questions how many possible images \u2014 real or not \u2014 exist in the digital space, and uses math to calculate a colossal number. A stunning series of images, ranging from the familiar life moments to those that completely bend reality, gives viewers a glimpse of what's out there.",
      "Meanwhile, Andrew Salter's \u201cJailbird,\" which snagged second place, chronicles a chicken's journey \u2014 from the bird's perspective \u2014 to a human prison in the United Kingdom to take part in a joint-rehabilitation program. And \u201cOne,\u201d a futuristic story by Ricardo Villavicencio and Edward Saatchi about interplanetary travel followed in third place.",
      "The 10 films shown were finalists selected from thousands submitted to Runway's AI Film Festival this year. The shorts will also be shown at screenings held in Los Angeles and Paris next week.",
      "How AI is used and executed is a factor judges evaluate when determining festival winners. But not every film entered was made entirely using AI. While submission criteria requires each movie include the use of AI-generated video, there's no set threshold, meaning some films can take a more \u201cmixed media\u201d approach \u2014 such as combining live shots of actors or real-life images and sounds with AI-generated elements.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re trying to encourage people to explore and experiment with it,\u201d Valenzuela said in an interview prior to Thursday's screening.",
      "Creating a coherent film using generative AI is no easy feat. It can take a long list of directions and numerous, detailed prompts to get even a short scene to make sense and look consistent. Still, the scope of what this kind of technology can do has grown significantly since Runway's first AI Film Festival in 2023 \u2014 and Valenzuela says that's reflected in today's submissions. While there are still limits, AI-generated video is becoming more and more life-like and realistic.",
      "Runway encourages the use of its own AI tools for films entered into its festival, but creators are also allowed to turn to other resources and tools as they put together the films \u2014 and across the industry, tools that use AI to create videos spanning from text, image and/or audio prompts have rapidly improved over recent years, while becoming increasingly available.",
      "\u201cThe way (this technology) has lived within film and media culture, and pop culture, has really accelerated,\u201d said Joshua Glick, an associate professor of film and electronic arts at Bard College.",
      "He adds that Runway's film fest, which is among a handful of showcases aimed at spotlighting AI's creative capabilities, arrives as companies in this space are searching for heightened \u201clegitimacy and recognition\u201d for the tools they are creating \u2014 with aims to cement partnerships in Hollywood as a result.",
      "AI's presence in Hollywood is already far-reaching, and perhaps more expansive than many moviegoers realize. Beyond \u201cheadline-grabbing\u201d (and at times controversial) applications that big-budget films have done to \u201cde-age\u201d actors or create eye-catching stunts, Glick notes, this technology is often incorporated in an array of post-production editing, digital touch-ups and additional behind-the-scenes work like sorting footage.",
      "Industry executives repeatedly point to how AI can improve efficiency in the movie making process \u2014 allowing creatives to perform a task that once took hours, for example, in a matter of minutes \u2014 and foster further innovation.",
      "Still, AI's rapid growth and adoption has also heightened anxieties around the burgeoning technology \u2014 notably its implications for workers.",
      "The International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees \u2014 which represents behind-the-scenes entertainment workers in the U.S. and Canada \u2014 has \u201clong embraced new technologies that enhance storytelling,\u201d Vanessa Holtgrewe, IATSE's international vice president, said in an emailed statement. \u201cBut we\u2019ve also been clear: AI must not be used to undermine workers\u2019 rights or livelihoods.\u201d",
      "IATSE and other unions have continued to meet with major studios and establish provisions in efforts to provide guardrails around the use of AI. The Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists has also been vocal about AI protections for its members, a key sticking point in recent labor actions.",

      "Britain\u2019s competition regulator says Amazon has pledged to beef up its systems to combat fake online reviews",
      "LONDON -- Amazon has pledged to beef up fight against fake reviews, Britain's competition regulator said Friday after an investigation into whether big online platforms are doing enough to crack down on phony online ratings for products and services.",
      "The Competition and Markets Authority said it secured the \u201cundertakings\u201d from Amazon, after getting a similar agreement earlier this year from Google to clamp down on rogue reviews plaguing the internet.",
      "The company promised to strengthen its existing systems for fighting fake reviews. It will also tackle catalog abuse, which involves sellers boosting star ratings for a product by hijacking good reviews from a completely different one.",
      "As an example, a shopper might come across a pair of headphones with a five-star rating. But, after looking closer, most of the reviews are for a mobile phone charger, the watchdog said.",
      "As part of its commitments, Amazon has agreed to sanction anyone caught using these tactics. Businesses could be banned from selling on the Amazon website and users posting fake reviews could be banned from posting them, the CMA said.",
      "The watchdog's chief executive, Sarah Cardell, said that so many people shop on Amazon and \u201cstar ratings and reviews have a huge impact on their choices.\u201d",
      "Amazon's pledges \u201cmean people can make decisions with greater confidence \u2013 knowing that those who seek to pull the wool over their eyes will be swiftly dealt with.\u201d",
      "The pledges apply to Amazon's U.K. website. The company said in a statement that it has zero tolerance for fake reviews and that the measures build on Amazon's existing efforts to tackle them.",
      "\u201cWe invest significant resources to proactively stop fake reviews ever appearing on our store, including on expert human investigators and machine learning models that analyse thousands of data points to detect risk,\" the company said.",
      "The CMA opened its investigations into Amazon and Google in 2021 to examine whether the two companies broke U.K. consumer law by failing to protect shoppers. It began looking into phony reviews on some big websites amid the boom in online shopping fueled by the coronavirus pandemic.",

      "President Donald Trump\u2019s pick to be U.S. surgeon general has said the nation\u2019s medical and food systems are corrupted by special interests and people out to make a profit at the expense of Americans\u2019 health",
      "PROVIDENCE, R.I. -- President Donald Trump\u2019s pick to be the next U.S. surgeon general has repeatedly said the nation\u2019s medical, health and food systems are corrupted by special interests and people out to make a profit at the expense of Americans\u2019 health.",
      "Yet as Dr. Casey Means has criticized scientists, medical schools and regulators for taking money from the food and pharmaceutical industries, she has promoted dozens of health and wellness products \u2014 including specialty basil seed supplements, a blood testing service and a prepared meal delivery service \u2014 in ways that put money in her own pocket.",
      "A review by The Associated Press found Means, who has carved out a niche in the wellness industry, set up deals with an array of businesses.",
      "In her newsletter, on her social media accounts, on her website, in her book and during podcast appearances, the entrepreneur and influencer has at times failed to disclose that she could profit or benefit in other ways from sales of products she recommends. In some cases, she promoted companies in which she was an investor or adviser without consistently disclosing the connection, the AP found.",
      "Means, 37, has said she recommends products that she has personally vetted and uses herself. She is far from the only online creator who doesn\u2019t always follow federal transparency rules that require influencers to disclose when they have a \u201cmaterial connection\u201d to a product they promote.",
      "Still, legal and ethics experts said those business entanglements raise concerns about conflicting interests for an aspiring surgeon general, a role responsible for giving Americans the best scientific information on how to improve their health.",
      "\u201cI fear that she will be cultivating her next employers and her next sponsors or business partners while in office,\u201d said Jeff Hauser, executive director of the Revolving Door Project, a progressive ethics watchdog monitoring executive branch appointees.",
      "The nomination, which comes amid a whirlwind of Trump administration actions to dismantle the government\u2019s public integrity guardrails, also has raised questions about whether Levels, a company Means co-founded that sells subscriptions for devices that continuously monitor users\u2019 glucose levels, could benefit from this administration\u2019s health guidance and policy.",
      "Though scientists debate whether continuous glucose monitors are beneficial for people without diabetes, U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has promoted their use as a precursor to making certain weight-loss drugs available to patients.",
      "The aspiring presidential appointee has built her own brand in part by criticizing doctors, scientists and government officials for being \u201cbought off\u201d or \u201ccorrupt\u201d because of ties to industry.",
      "Means' use of affiliate marketing and other methods of making money from her recommendations for supplements, medical tests and other health and dietary products raise questions about the extent to which she is influenced by a different set of special interests: those of the wellness industry.",
      "Means earned her medical degree from Stanford University, but she dropped out of her residency program in Oregon in 2018, and her license to practice is inactive. She has grown her public profile in part with a compelling origin story that seeks to explain why she left her residency and conventional medicine.",
      "\u201cDuring my training as a surgeon, I saw how broken and exploitative the healthcare system is and left to focus on how to keep people out of the operating room,\u201d she wrote on her website.",
      "Means turned to alternative approaches to address what she has described as widespread metabolic dysfunction driven largely by poor nutrition and an overabundance of ultra-processed foods. She co-founded Levels, a nutrition, sleep and exercise-tracking app that can also give users insights from blood tests and continuous glucose monitors. The company charges $199 per year for an app subscription and an additional $184 per month for glucose monitors.",
      "Means has argued that the medical system is incentivized not to look at the root causes of illness but instead to maintain profits by keeping patients sick and coming back for more prescription drugs and procedures.",
      "\u201cAt the highest level of our medical institutions, there are conflicts of interest and corruption that are actually making the science that we\u2019re getting not as accurate and not as clean as we\u2019d want it,\u201d she said on Megyn Kelly's podcast last year.",
      "But even as Means decries the influence of money on science and medicine, she has made her own deals with business interests.",
      "During the same Megyn Kelly podcast, Means mentioned a frozen prepared food brand, Daily Harvest. She promoted that brand in a book she published last year. What she didn\u2019t mention in either instance: Means had a business relationship with Daily Harvest.",
      "Influencer marketing has expanded beyond the beauty, fashion and travel sectors to \u201cencompass more and more of our lives,\u201d said Emily Hund, author of \u201cThe Influencer Industry: The Quest for Authenticity on Social Media.\u201d",
      "With more than 825,000 followers on Instagram and a newsletter that she has said reached 200,000 subscribers, Means has a direct line into the social media feeds and inboxes of an audience interested in health, nutrition and wellness.",
      "Affiliate marketing, brand partnerships and similar business arrangements are growing more popular as social media becomes increasingly lucrative for influencers, especially among younger generations. Companies might provide a payment, free or discounted products or other benefits to the influencer in exchange for a post or a mention. But most consumers still don\u2019t realize that a personality recommending a product might make money if people click through and buy, said University of Minnesota professor Christopher Terry.",
      "\u201cA lot of people watch those influencers, and they take what those influencers say as gospel,\u201d said Terry, who teaches media advertising and internet law. Even his own students don\u2019t understand that influencers might stand to benefit from sales of the products they endorse, he added.",
      "Many companies, including Amazon, have affiliate marketing programs in which people with substantial social media followings can sign up to receive a percentage of sales or some other benefit when someone clicks through and buys a product using a special individualized link or code shared by the influencer.",
      "Means has used such links to promote various products sold on Amazon. Among them are books, including the one she co-wrote, \u201cGood Energy\"; a walking pad; soap; body oil; hair products; cardamom-flavored dental floss; organic jojoba oil; a razor set; reusable kitchen products; sunglasses; a sleep mask; a silk pillowcase; fitness and sleep trackers; protein powder and supplements.",
      "She also has shared links to products sold by other companies that included \u201caffiliate\u201d or \u201cpartner\u201d coding, indicating she has a business relationship with the companies. The products include an AI-powered sleep system and Daily Harvest, for which she curated a \u201cmetabolic health collection.\u201d",
      "On a \u201cMy Faves\u201d page that was taken down from her website shortly after Trump picked her, Means wrote that some links \u201care affiliate links and I make a small percentage if you buy something after clicking them.\u201d",
      "It's not clear how much money Means has earned from her affiliate marketing, partnerships and other agreements. Daily Harvest did not return messages seeking comment, and Means said she could not comment on the record during the confirmation process.",
      "Means has raised concerns that scientists, regulators and doctors are swayed by the influence of industry, oftentimes pointing to public disclosures of their connections. In January, she told the Kristin Cavallari podcast \u201cLet\u2019s Be Honest\u201d that \u201crelationships are influential.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s huge money, huge money going to fund scientists from industry,\" Means said. \"We know that when industry funds papers, it does skew outcomes.\u201d",
      "In November, on a podcast run by a beauty products brand, Primally Pure, she said it was \u201cinsanity\u201d to have people connected to the processed food industry involved in writing food guidelines, adding, \u201cWe need unbiased people writing our guidelines that aren\u2019t getting their mortgage paid by a food company.\u201d",
      "On the same podcast, she acknowledged supplement companies sponsor her newsletter, adding, \u201cI do understand how it\u2019s messy.\u201d",
      "Influencers who endorse or promote products in exchange for payment or something else of value are required by the Federal Trade Commission to make a clear and conspicuous disclosure of any business, family or personal relationship. While Means did provide disclosures about newsletter sponsors, the AP found in other cases Means did not always tell her audience when she had a connection to the companies she promoted. For example, a \u201cClean Personal & Home Care Product Recommendations\u201d guide she links to from her website contains two dozen affiliate or partner links and no disclosure that she could profit from any sales.",
      "Means has said she invested in Function Health, which provides subscription-based lab testing for $500 annually. Of the more than a dozen online posts the AP found in which Means mentioned Function Health, more than half did not disclose she had any affiliation with the company.",
      "Means also listed the supplement company Zen Basil as a company for which she was an \u201cInvestor and/or Advisor.\u201d The AP found posts on Instagram, X and on Facebook where Means promoted its products without disclosing the relationship.",
      "Though the \u201cAbout\u201d page on her website discloses an affiliation with both companies, that\u2019s not enough, experts said. She is required to disclose any material connection she has to a company anytime she promotes it.",
      "Representatives for Function Health did not return messages seeking comment through their website and executives' LinkedIn profiles. Zen Basil's founder, Shakira Niazi, did not answer questions about Means' business relationship with the company or her disclosures of it. She said the two had known each other for about four years and called Means' advice \u201ctransformational,\u201d saying her teachings reversed Niazi's prediabetes and other ailments.",
      "\u201cI am proud to sponsor her newsletter through my company,\u201d Niazi said in an email.",
      "While the disclosure requirements are rarely enforced by the FTC, Means should have been informing her readers of any connections regardless of whether she was violating any laws, said Olivier Sylvain, a Fordham Law School professor who was previously a senior adviser to the FTC chair.",
      "\u201cWhat you want in a surgeon general, presumably, is someone who you trust to talk about tobacco, about social media, about caffeinated alcoholic beverages, things that present problems in public health,\u201d Sylvain said, adding, \u201cShould there be any doubt about claims you make about products?\u201d",
      "Means isn\u2019t the first surgeon general nominee whose financial entanglements have raised eyebrows.",
      "Jerome Adams, who served as surgeon general from 2017 to 2021, filed federal disclosure forms that showed he invested in several health technology, insurance and pharmaceutical companies before taking the job \u2014 among them Pfizer, Mylan and UnitedHealth Group. He also invested in the food and drink giant Nestle.",
      "He divested those stocks when he was confirmed for the role and pledged that he and his immediate family would not acquire financial interest in certain industries regulated by the Food and Drug Administration.",
      "Vivek Murthy, who served as surgeon general twice, under Presidents Barack Obama and Joe Biden, made more than $2 million in COVID-19-related speaking and consulting fees from Carnival, Netflix, Estee Lauder and Airbnb between holding those positions. He pledged to recuse himself from matters involving those parties for a period of time.",
      "Means has not yet gone through a Senate confirmation hearing and has not yet announced the ethical commitments she will make for the role.",
      "Hund said that as influencer marketing becomes more common, it is raising more ethical questions, such as what past influencers who enter government should do to avoid the appearance of a conflict.",
      "Other administration officials, including Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Administrator Dr. Mehmet Oz, have also promoted companies on social media without disclosing their financial ties.",
      "\u201cThis is like a learning moment in the evolution of our democracy,\u201d Hund said. \u201cIs this a runaway train that we just have to get on and ride, or is this something that we want to go differently?\u201d",

      "Elon Musk is threatening to decommission a capsule used to take astronauts and supplies to the International Space Station for NASA",
      "As President Donald Trump and Elon Musk argued on social media on Thursday, the world's richest man threatened to decommission a space capsule used to take astronauts and supplies to the International Space Station.",
      "After Trump threatened to cut government contracts given to Musk's SpaceX rocket company and his Starlink internet satellite services, Musk responded via X that SpaceX \"will begin decommissioning its Dragon spacecraft immediately.\u201d",
      "It's unclear how serious Musk's threat was. But the capsule, developed with the help of government contracts, is an important part of keeping the space station running. NASA also relies heavily on SpaceX for other programs including launching science missions and, later this decade, returning astronauts to the surface of the moon.",
      "SpaceX is the only U.S. company capable right now of transporting crews to and from the space station, using its four-person Dragon capsules.",
      "Boeing\u2019s Starliner capsule has flown astronauts only once; last year\u2019s test flight went so badly that the two NASA astronauts had to hitch a ride back to Earth via SpaceX in March, more than nine months after launching last June.",
      "Starliner remains grounded as NASA decides whether to go with another test flight with cargo, rather than a crew.",
      "SpaceX also uses a Dragon capsule for its own privately run missions. The next one of those is due to fly next week on a trip chartered by Axiom Space, a Houston company.",
      "Cargo versions of the Dragon capsule are also used to ferry food and other supplies to the orbiting lab.",
      "Russia\u2019s Soyuz capsules are the only other means of getting crews to the space station right now.",
      "The Soyuz capsules hold three people at a time. For now, each Soyuz launch carries two Russians and one NASA astronaut, and each SpaceX launch has one Russian on board under a barter system. That way, in an emergency requiring a capsule to return, there is always someone from the U.S. and Russian on board.",
      "With its first crew launch for NASA in 2020 \u2014 the first orbital flight of a crew by a private company \u2014 SpaceX enabled NASA to reduce its reliance on Russia for crew transport. The Russian flights had been costing the U.S. tens of millions of dollars per seat, for years.",
      "NASA has also used Russian spacecraft for cargo, along with U.S. contractor Northrup Grumman.",
      "The company has used its rockets to launch several science missions for NASA as well as military equipment.",
      "Last year, SpaceX also won a NASA contract to help bring the space station out of orbit when it is no longer usable.",
      "SpaceX\u2019s Starship mega rocket is what NASA has picked to get astronauts from lunar orbit to the surface of the moon, at least for the first two landing missions. Starship made its ninth test flight last week from Texas, but tumbled out of control and broke apart.",

      "Investors bought hundreds of billions of dollars of Tesla stock after Donald Trump was elected on a bet that politics were more important than profits.",
      "In three hours Thursday, they learned yet again how dangerous that gamble could be.",
      "Shares of Elon Musk\u2019s electric vehicle maker plunged more than 14% in a stunning wipeout as investors dumped holdings amid a bitter war of words between the president and the world's richest man. By the end of the trading day, $150 billion of Tesla's value had been erased, more than what it would take to buy all the shares of Starbucks and hundreds of other big publicly traded U.S. companies.",
      "In after-hours trading, Tesla shares rose 0.8%.",
      "The disagreement started over the president's budget bill, then quickly turned nasty. After Musk said that Trump wouldn't haven't gotten elected without his help, Trump implied that he may turn the federal government against his companies, including Tesla and SpaceX.",
      "\u201cThe easiest way to save money in our Budget, Billions and Billions of Dollars, is to terminate Elon\u2019s Governmental Subsidies and Contracts,\u201d Trump wrote on his social messaging service Truth Social. \u201cI was always surprised that Biden didn\u2019t do it!\u201d",
      "The drop on Thursday partially reversed a big runup in the eight weeks since Musk confirmed that Tesla would be testing an autonomous, driverless \u201crobotaxi\u201d service in Austin, Texas, this month.",
      "Investors fear Trump might not be in such a rush to usher in a future of self-driving cars in the U.S., and that could slam Tesla. So much of its real business selling electric cars is struggling now and so it needs the promise of a new age of driverless cars to be realized\u2014 and fast.",
      "\u201cThe whole goal of robotaxis is to have them in 20 or 25 cities next year,\" said Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives, one of Tesla's biggest fans, but now worried. \"If you start to heighten the regulatory environment, that could delay that path.\u201d",
      "He added, \"There is a fear that Trump is not going to play Mr. Nice Guy.\u201d",
      "Trump's threat to cut government contracts seems targeted more to another of Musk's businesses, SpaceX, than his car company. The privately held rocket company has received billions of dollars for sending astronauts and cargo to the International Space Station, providing launches and doing other work for NASA. The company is currently racing to develop a mega rocket for the space agency to send astronauts to moon next year.",
      "A subsidiary of SpaceX, the satellite internet company Starlink, appears to also have benefited from Musk's once-close relationship with the president.",
      "On a trip with Trump to the Middle East last month, Musk announced that Saudi Arabia had approved Starlink for aviation and maritime use. Though its not clear how much politics has played a role, a string of other recent deals in Bangladesh, Pakistan, India and elsewhere has come as Trump has threatened tariffs and sent diplomats scrambling to please the president.",
      "One measure of SpaceX's success: A private financing round followed by a private sale of shares in recent months reportedly valued it at an $350 billion, up from an estimated $210 billion a year ago.",
      "Now all that is possibly in danger. Tesla shares got even a bigger lift from Musk's close relationship with Trump, initially at least.",
      "After the presidential election in November, investors rushed into the stock, adding more than $450 billion to its value in a few weeks. The belief was that the company would see big riches as Trump eased regulatory oversight of Tesla. They also were betting that the new administration would embrace Musk's plans for millions of cars on U.S. roads without drivers behind the wheel.",
      "After hitting an all-time high on Dec. 17, the shares retreated as Musk\u2019s time as head of a government cost-cutting group led to boycotts and a hit to Tesla's reputation. They've recently popped higher again after Musk vowed to focus more on Tesla and its upcoming driverless taxi launch.",

    "story": [
      "A study published in the academic journal Science has found that cutting off the horns of rhinos in Africa leads to a reduction in poaching of the endangered species",
      "CAPE TOWN, South Africa -- Cutting off the horns of sedated rhinos with a chainsaw has been viewed by wildlife conservationists in Africa for more than 30 years as a necessary evil to save the iconic endangered species from poaching.",
      "They hoped the drastic action was working, but evidence was scarce.",
      "Now, a study published Thursday in the academic journal Science has found that dehorning rhinos has led to a large reduction in poaching in game reserves in and around the Kruger National Park in northern South Africa \u2014 an area that's home to 25% of the world's rhinos and is especially vulnerable to poaching.",
      "The results of the seven-year study that ended in 2023 are seen as long-awaited evidence that removing rhinos' horns \u2014 which needs to be done every one to two years because they grow back \u2014 helps them survive, even if the animals lose part of their makeup.",
      "The conclusions seem obvious. Lucrative illegal markets in parts of southeast Asia and China crave rhino horns for use in traditional medicines, and removing the rhinos' horns take away what poachers are after.",
      "But Tim Kuiper, a biodiversity scientist at South Africa's Nelson Mandela University and the lead author of the study, said it was new to have long-term data from multiple sites on dehorning rhinos. He said the study, conducted between January 2017 and December 2023, focused on 11 reserves in the Kruger area and compared data from eight that dehorned their rhinos against the three that didn't.",
      "It also analyzed data from the reserves before and after they dehorned their rhinos.",
      "The study showed that dehorning consistently reduced poaching, Kuiper said. It found that the dehorning of more than 2,000 rhinos resulted in a 78% reduction in poaching in those eight reserves, providing some confirmation that such an invasive intervention was worth it.",
      "\u201cIt is a big part of what a rhino is, having a horn,\u201d Kuiper said. \u201cSo having to remove it is kind of a necessary evil, if I can put it that way. But it\u2019s very effective. There\u2019s no doubt it saved hundreds of rhinos' lives.\u201d",
      "South Africa has the largest numbers of black and white rhinos. Namibia, Zimbabwe and Kenya also have significant populations. There are around 17,500 white rhinos and 6,500 black rhinos left in the world, with black rhino numbers reduced from 70,000 in 1970 to less than 2,500 by the time poaching reached a crisis point in the mid-1990s, according to the Save the Rhino organization.",
      "Dehorning rhinos started in southern Africa as early as 1989. It has not been accepted without question.",
      "There has been opposition from animal rights activists but also questions from conservationists over what impact it has on a rhino's wellbeing, and what a future might look like with more hornless rhinos.",
      "Vanessa Duthe, a rhino researcher in South Africa not involved in the study, said rhinos use their horns to defend themselves against predators, to compete for territory and, in the case of black rhinos, to look for food. There is also evidence that dehorned rhinos adjust their movements to live in smaller ranges, she said.",
      "She said conservationists don't know the full impacts of dehorning, but research had found it had no adverse effect on rhinos' breeding rates or mortality rates.",
      "\u201cWhat we do know is that the benefits of dehorning by far outweigh any ecological cost that we\u2019re aware of today,\u201d Duthe said. She said dehorning a rhino now takes around 10 minutes and the process causes minimum distress. Blindfolds and earmuffs are put on sedated rhinos during dehorning, which also provides an opportunity to microchip rhinos and collect samples that aid research.",
      "Conservationists agree that dehorning alone will not end rhino poaching and Kuiper said he saw it as a short-to-mid-term solution. Other efforts like more effective law enforcement and better support for game rangers on the frontline are key.",
      "While South Africa has helped pull rhinos back from the threat of extinction, more than 400 rhinos a year are still killed by poachers in the country.",
      "The dehorning study was a collaboration between scientists from three South African universities, Oxford University in England and game reserve managers and rangers. It also involved the South African National Parks department, the World Wildlife Fund and the Rhino Recovery Fund.",

      "Three decades ago, foreign students at Harvard University accounted for just 11% of the total student body",
      "WASHINGTON -- Three decades ago, foreign students at Harvard University accounted for just 11% of the total student body. Today, they account for 26%.",
      "Like other prestigious U.S. universities, Harvard for years has been cashing in on its global cache to recruit the world\u2019s best students. Now, the booming international enrollment has left colleges vulnerable to a new line of attack from President Donald Trump. The president has begun to use his control over the nation\u2019s borders as leverage in his fight to reshape American higher education.",
      "Trump\u2019s latest salvo against Harvard uses a broad federal law to bar foreign students from entering the country to attend the campus in Cambridge, Massachusetts. His proclamation applies only to Harvard, and a federal judge late Thursday temporarily blocked it. But Trump's order poses a threat to other universities his administration has targeted as hotbeds of liberalism in need of reform.",
      "It\u2019s rattling campuses under federal scrutiny, including Columbia University, where foreign students make up 40% of the campus. As the Trump administration stepped up reviews of new student visas last week, a group of Columbia faculty and alumni raised concerns over Trump\u2019s gatekeeping powers.",
      "\u201cColumbia\u2019s exposure to this \u2018stroke of pen\u2019 risk is uniquely high,\u201d the Stand Columbia Society wrote in a newsletter.",
      "People from other countries made up about 6% of all college students in the U.S. in 2023, but they accounted for 27% of the eight schools in the Ivy League, according to an Associated Press analysis of Education Department data. Columbia\u2019s 40% was the largest concentration, followed by Harvard and Cornell at about 25%. Brown University had the smallest share at 20%.",
      "Other highly selective private universities have seen similar trends, including at Northeastern University and New York University, which each saw foreign enrollment double between 2013 and 2023. Growth at public universities has been more muted. Even at the 50 most selective public schools, foreign students account for about 11% of the student body.",
      "As the middle class has grown in other countries, more families have been able to afford test prep and admissions guidance to compete for spots in the Ivy League, said Rajika Bhandari, who leads a firm of higher education consultants.",
      "\u201cThe Ivy League brand is very strong overseas, especially in countries like India and China, where families are extremely brand-aware of top institutions in the U.S. and other competing countries,\u201d Bhandari said in an email.",
      "Over the last two decades, she said, U.S. universities have increasingly recognized the benefits of international exchange, seeing it as a crucial revenue source that subsidizes U.S. students and keeps enrollments up in the STEM fields of science, technology, engineering and math.",
      "America\u2019s universities have been widening their doors to foreign students for decades, but the numbers shot upward starting around 2008, as Chinese students came to U.S. universities in rising numbers.",
      "It was part of a \u201cgold rush\u201d in higher education, said William Brustein, who orchestrated the international expansion of several universities.",
      "\u201cWhether you were private or you were public, you had to be out in front in terms of being able to claim you were the most global university,\" said Brustein, who led efforts at Ohio State University and West Virginia University.",
      "The race was driven in part by economics, he said. Foreign students typically aren\u2019t eligible for financial aid and, at some schools, they pay much higher tuition than their American counterparts. Colleges also were eyeing global rankings that gave schools a boost if they recruited larger numbers of foreign students and scholars, he said.",
      "Some wealthier universities \u2014 including Harvard \u2014 offer financial aid to foreign students. But students who get into those top-tier U.S. universities often have the means to pay higher tuition rates, Brustein said. That provides further incentive to enroll more foreign students, he said, saving more scholarship money for American students.",
      "Still, international enrollment didn't expand equally across all types of colleges. Public universities often face pressure from state lawmakers to limit foreign enrollment and keep more seats open for state residents. Private universities don\u2019t face that pressure, and many aggressively recruited foreign students as their enrollment of U.S. students stayed flat. The college-going rate among American students has changed little for decades, and some have been turned off on college by rising costs and student debt loads.",
      "Proponents of international exchange say foreign students pour billions of dollars into the U.S. economy, and many go on to support the nation\u2019s tech industry and other fields in need of skilled workers. Most international students study STEM fields.",
      "In the Ivy League, most international growth has been at the graduate level, while undergraduate numbers have seen more modest increases. Foreign graduate students make up more than half the students at Harvard\u2019s government and design schools, along with five of Columbia\u2019s schools.",
      "Harvard's undergraduate foreign population increased by about 100 students from 2013 to 2023, while graduate numbers increased by nearly 2,000. Part of that growth can be explained by increasing global competition at the graduate level, said William Kirby, a historian at Harvard who has written about the evolution of higher education.",
      "\u201cIf you don\u2019t recruit the very best students internationally in your most important graduate programs, particularly in science and engineering, then you will not be competitive,\" Kirby said.",
      "The Ivy League has been able to outpace other schools in large part because of its reputation, Brustein said. He recalls trips to China and India, where he spoke with families that could recite where each Ivy League school sat in world rankings.",
      "\u201cThat was the golden calf for these families. They really thought, \u2018If we could just get into these schools, the rest of our lives would be on easy street,\u2019\u201d he said.",
      "Last week, Trump said he thought Harvard should cap its foreign students to about 15%.",
      "\u201cWe have people who want to go to Harvard and other schools, they can\u2019t get in because we have foreign students there,\u201d Trump said at a news conference.",
      "The university called Trump's latest action banning entry into the country to attend Harvard \u201cyet another illegal retaliatory step taken by the Administration in violation of Harvard\u2019s First Amendment rights.\u201d",
      "In a lawsuit challenging the Trump administration\u2019s previous attempt to block international students at Harvard, the university said its foreign student population was the result of \u201ca painstaking, decades-long project\u201d to attract the most qualified international students. Losing access to student visas would immediately harm the school\u2019s mission and reputation, it said.",
      "\u201cIn our interconnected global economy,\" the school said, \u201ca university that cannot welcome students from all corners of the world is at a competitive disadvantage.\u201d",

      "It's kitten season in warm-weather areas and animal shelters need all the help they can get",
      "NEW YORK -- Strawberry, Blueberry, JoJo and Mazzy were about 6 weeks old when animal rescuers coaxed them out of long metal pipes in the parking lot of a storage unit company. Meatball was a single kitten living in a cold garage with a group of semi-feral adult cats.",
      "Spaghetti, Macaroni and Rigatoni, meanwhile, were just 2 weeks old when the good folks of LIC Feral Feeders, a cat rescue in Queens, took them in and bottle-fed them until they were strong enough to survive.",
      "Consider these cuties the face of kitten season 2025.",
      "Kitten season, typically landing during warmer months, is the time of year when most cats give birth. That produces a surge of kittens, often fragile neonates. Shelters get overwhelmed, especially when it comes to the 24-hour care and feeding of extremely young kittens.",
      "That, as a result, triggers a need for more foster homes because many of the 4,000 or so shelters in the U.S. don't have the time or resources for around-the-clock care, said Hannah Shaw, an animal welfare advocate known as the Kitten Lady with more than a million followers on Instagram.",
      "\u201cWe see about 1.5 million kittens entering shelters every year. And most of them will come into shelters during May and June,\u201d she said. \u201cShelters need all hands on deck to help out through fostering.\u201d",
      "Familiarity with fostering animals is high, Shaw said. The act of doing it is a different story. There's a false perception, she said, that the expense of fostering animals falls on the people who step up to do it. These days, many shelters and rescues cover the food, supplies and medical costs of fostering.",
      "\u201cA lot of people don\u2019t foster because they think it\u2019s going to be this huge cost, but fostering actually only costs you time and love,\u201d she said.",
      "Lisa Restine, a Hill\u2019s Pet Nutrition veterinarian, said people looking to adopt kittens should take pairs since cats often bond early in life. And how many cats is too many cats per household?",
      "\u201cThis is nothing serious or medical but my general rule of thumb is the number of adults in the house, like a 2-to-1 ratio, because you can carry one cat in each hand, so if there are two adults you can have four cats and still be sane,\u201d she said.",
      "Square footage to avoid territory disputes is a good rule of thumb when planning for cats, Restine said. Two cats per 800 square feet then 200 square feet more for each addition should help, she said.",
      "Littermates, like Macaroni and Rigatoni, are much more likely to bond, Restine said. Kittens not biologically related but raised together often bond as well \u2014 like Meatball and Spaghetti. But adopters hoping to bond an adult cat with a new kitten arrival may be disappointed.",
      "\u201cOnce they're over that 3- or 4-month mark, it's hard to get that true bonding,\u201d Restine said.",
      "Typically, kittens stay in their foster homes from a few weeks to a few months. While statistics are not kept on the number of kitten fosters that \u201cfail\u201d \u2014 when foster families decided to keep their charges \u2014 some shelters report rates as high as 90%. That's a win, despite use of the word \u201cfail,\u201d advocates note.",
      "Shaw sees another barrier holding people back from fostering: the notion that it requires special training or skills. That's why she has dedicated her life to educating the public, offering videos, books and research on how it works at her site kittenlady.org.",
      "Companies are coming on board, too. Hill's, a pet food company, runs the Hill\u2019s Food, Shelter & Love program. It has provided more than $300 million in food support to over 1,000 animal shelters that support fostering in North America.",
      "\u201cAbout a quarter of a million kittens, unfortunately, don\u2019t survive in our shelters every year,\u201d Shaw said. \u201cThe shelter\u2019s going to be there to mentor and support you. So I think a lot of the fear that people have about fostering, they might find that actually it is something you totally can do. It\u2019s just scary because you haven\u2019t done it yet.\u201d",

      "The Nintendo Switch 2 finally hit store shelves on Thursday, eight years after the initial release of Japanese video-game maker Nintendo\u2019s popular video-game console",
      "NEW YORK -- The Nintendo Switch 2 finally hit store shelves on Thursday, eight years after the initial release of Japanese video-game maker Nintendo's popular video game console.",
      "Even with a hefty $450 price tag, fans around the world, from Japan to the U.S., lined up outside stores to pick up pre-orders or have a chance to buy the device. The release ends months of anticipation that included pre-order hiccups and fears that tariffs would delay the release of the Switch 2.",
      "Here's what to know about the release and where you can buy it.",
      "The Nintendo Switch's unique ability to switch from a handheld console to a traditional one helped make it a hit when it launched in 2017. The Nintendo Switch Lite, which was a handheld-only device released two years later, also became popular, especially during the pandemic. It helped usher in bestselling Nintendo games including \u201cThe Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild,\u201d \u201cMario Kart 8 Deluxe\u201d and \u201cAnimal Crossing: New Horizons.\u201d",
      "The Nintendo Switch 2 adds interactive chat and screenshare functions to connect gamers. It will also have a more vibrant display and a larger screen.",
      "Nintendo has sold a total of 152 million Switches, just behind its best-selling Nintendo DS console which saw 154 million units move, according to the company. But demand has dwindled for the Switch, now in its eighth year after its debut. Nintendo hopes the new console will boost its declining sales.",
      "The base Switch 2 costs $450 and a bundle with the new \u201cMario Kart World\u201d included costs $500. It can be found online and in-store at major retailers like Walmart, Target and Best Buy, as well as specialty retailers such as GameStop, but it is expected to be snapped up fast and widespread shortages are expected.",
      "The on-again, off-again tariffs ordered by President Trump \u2014 which included goods from Japan \u2014 sparked fears Nintendo might have to delay the device. But the launch comes within the 90-day pause on most tariffs. U.S. preorders for the Switch 2 were delayed for several weeks so the company could assess the potential impact of tariffs.",
      "When they started in April, high demand sparked a chaotic pre-order process. Scores of consumers trying to pre-order ran into delays or errors.",
      "Shoppers took to social media to share long wait times and screenshots of error messages and carts that suddenly went empty. Nintendo acknowledged the \u201cvery high demand\u201d at the time and said it was working hard to fulfill orders, but also urged people to try to buy the device without a pre-order on June 5.",
      "Nintendo said it expects to sell 15 million Switch 2 consoles for the fiscal year through March 2026.",
      "The company is hoping the device jump-starts its sagging sales. In May Nintendo reported a 43% decline in profit for the fiscal year through March but promised a turnaround.",

      "A private lunar lander from Japan has crashed into the moon",
      "A private lunar lander from Japan crashed while attempting a touchdown Friday, the latest casualty in the commercial rush to the moon.",
      "The Tokyo-based company ispace declared the mission a failure several hours after communication was lost with the lander. Flight controllers scrambled to gain contact, but were met with only silence and said they were concluding the mission.",
      "Communications ceased less than two minutes before the spacecraft\u2019s scheduled landing on the moon with a mini rover. Until then, the descent from lunar orbit seemed to be going well.",
      "CEO and founder Takeshi Hakamada apologized to everyone who contributed to the mission, the second lunar strikeout for ispace.",
      "Two years ago, the company\u2019s first moonshot ended in a crash landing, giving rise to the name \u201cResilience\u201d for its successor lander. Resilience carried a rover with a shovel to gather lunar dirt as well as a Swedish artist\u2019s toy-size red house for placement on the moon\u2019s dusty surface.",
      "Company officials said it was too soon to know whether the same problem doomed both missions.",
      "\u201cThis is the second time that we were not able to land. So we really have to take it very seriously,\" Hakamada told reporters. He stressed that the company would press ahead with more lunar missions.",
      "A preliminary analysis indicates the laser system for measuring the altitude did not work as planned, and the lander descended too fast, officials said. \"Based on these circumstances, it is currently assumed that the lander likely performed a hard landing on the lunar surface,\u201d the company said in a written statement.",
      "Long the province of governments, the moon became a target of private outfits in 2019, with more flops than wins along the way.",
      "Launched in January from Florida on a long, roundabout journey, Resilience entered lunar orbit last month. It shared a SpaceX ride with Firefly Aerospace\u2019s Blue Ghost, which reached the moon faster and became the first private entity to successfully land there in March.",
      "Another U.S. company, Intuitive Machines, arrived at the moon a few days after Firefly. But the tall, spindly lander face-planted in a crater near the moon\u2019s south pole and was declared dead within hours.",
      "Resilience was targeting the top of the moon, a less treacherous place than the shadowy bottom. The ispace team chose a flat area with few boulders in Mare Frigoris or Sea of Cold, a long and narrow region full of craters and ancient lava flows that stretches across the near side\u2019s northern tier.",
      "Plans had called for the 7.5-foot (2.3-meter) Resilience to beam back pictures within hours and for the lander to lower the piggybacking rover onto the lunar surface this weekend.",
      "Made of carbon fiber-reinforced plastic with four wheels, ispace\u2019s European-built rover \u2014 named Tenacious \u2014 sported a high-definition camera to scout out the area and a shovel to scoop up some lunar dirt for NASA.",
      "The rover, weighing just 11 pounds (5 kilograms), was going to stick close to the lander, going in circles at a speed of less than one inch (a couple centimeters) per second. It was capable of venturing up to two-thirds of a mile (1 kilometer) from the lander and should be operational throughout the two-week mission, the period of daylight.",
      "Besides science and tech experiments, there was an artistic touch.",
      "The rover held a tiny, Swedish-style red cottage with white trim and a green door, dubbed the Moonhouse by creator Mikael Genberg, for placement on the lunar surface.",
      "Minutes before the attempted landing, Hakamada assured everyone that ispace had learned from its first failed mission. \u201cEngineers did everything they possibly could\u201d to ensure success this time, he said.",
      "He considered the latest moonshot \u201cmerely a steppingstone\u201d to its bigger lander launching by 2027 with NASA involvement.",
      "Ispace, like other businesses, does not have \u201cinfinite funds\u201d and cannot afford repeated failures, Jeremy Fix, chief engineer for ispace\u2019s U.S. subsidiary, said at a conference last month.",
      "While not divulging the cost of the current mission, company officials said it\u2019s less than the first one which exceeded $100 million.",
      "Two other U.S. companies are aiming for moon landings by year\u2019s end: Jeff Bezos\u2019 Blue Origin and Astrobotic Technology. Astrobotic\u2019s first lunar lander missed the moon altogether in 2024 and came crashing back through Earth\u2019s atmosphere.",
      "For decades, governments competed to get to the moon. Only five countries have pulled off successful robotic lunar landings: Russia, the U.S., China, India and Japan. Of those, only the U.S. has landed people on the moon: 12 NASA astronauts from 1969 through 1972.",
      "NASA expects to send four astronauts around the moon next year. That would be followed a year or more later by the first lunar landing by a crew in more than a half-century, with SpaceX's Starship providing the lift from lunar orbit all the way down to the surface. China also has moon landing plans for its own astronauts by 2030.",

      "Federal prosecutors have charged two Chinese researchers with smuggling a crop-killing fungus into the U.S. last summer",
      "NEW YORK -- Federal prosecutors charged two Chinese researchers on Tuesday with smuggling a crop-killing fungus into the U.S. last summer \u2014 charges that come amid heightened political tensions between the two countries and as the Trump administration moves to revoke visas from visiting Chinese students.",
      "Yunqing Jian and Zunyong Liu are charged with conspiracy, smuggling, making false statements and visa fraud for allegedly bringing the fungus Fusarium graminearum into the U.S. Jian, 33, was booked in a Detroit federal court. Liu, 34, is thought to be in China.",
      "According to the FBI, Liu had small baggies of the fungus stashed in his backpack when he flew to the U.S. last year and, after claiming ignorance about the plant material inside them, said he was planning to use it for research at a University of Michigan lab where Jian worked and where Liu previously worked.",
      "Fusarium graminearum causes a disease called Fusarium head blight that can wipe out cereal crops such as wheat, barley and maize and rice \u2014 it inflicts $1 billion in losses annually on U.S. wheat and barley crops, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.",
      "It isn\u2019t the only fungus to cause Fusarium head blight, but it\u2019s the most common culprit in the U.S. The fungus infects plants early in the growing season, shriveling wheat grains and blanching crop heads a whitish-tan color. It also causes a toxin to accumulate in wheat kernels that can make them unsafe for people and livestock to eat.",
      "Nicknamed \u201cvomitoxin\u201d because it\u2019s most known for causing livestock to throw up, it can also cause diarrhea, abdominal pain, headache and fever in animals and people.",
      "Wheat and other grain crops are screened for various toxins, including Fusarium graminearum, before they can be used to feed animals and humans. Farmers have to throw out any infected grains, which can cause devastating losses.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s one of the many problems that farmers have to deal with that risks their livelihood,\u201d said David Geiser, a Fusarium expert at Penn State.",
      "Although Jian and Liu are accused of smuggling Fusarium graminearum into the country, the fungus is already prevalent in the U.S. \u2014 particularly in the east and Upper Midwest \u2014 and scientists have been studying it for decades.",
      "Researchers often bring foreign plants, animals and even strains of fungi to the U.S. to study them, but they must file certain permits before moving anything across state or national borders. Studying the genes of a foreign fungus strain, for example, can help scientists learn how it tolerates heat, resists pesticides or mutates.",
      "\u201cWe look at variations among individuals just like we do humans,\u201d said Nicole Gauthier, a plant pathologist at the University of Kentucky who studies Fusarium.",
      "That said, it\u2019s unclear why the Chinese researchers might have wanted to bring that strain of Fusarium graminearum into the U.S. and why they didn\u2019t fill out the proper paperwork to do so.",

      "The \"It Ends With Us\" co-stars have been in a heated legal feud since 2024.",
      "Justin Baldoni's lawsuit against Blake Lively was dismissed by a federal judge in New York on Monday.",
      "The \"It Ends With Us\" co-stars have been in a heated legal feud since December 2024.",
      "In his motion, Judge Lewis J. Liman dismissed Justin Baldoni's $400 million countersuit against Lively, her husband Ryan Reynolds, the couple's publicist, Leslie Sloane, as well as Baldoni's defamation claim against The New York Times.",
      "\"The alleged facts indicate that the Times reviewed the available evidence and reported, perhaps in a dramatized manner, what it believed to have happened,\" the opinion said. \"The Times had no obvious motive to favor Lively's version of events.\"",
      "Baldoni has until June 23 to refile some of his claims.",
      "Lively's lawyers, Esra Hudson and Mike Gottlieb, called the dismissal a \"total victory and complete vindication for Blake Lively, along with those that Justin Baldoni and the Wayfarer Parties dragged into their retaliatory lawsuit, including Ryan Reynolds, Leslie Sloane and The New York Times.\"",
      "\"As we have said from day one, this '$400 million' lawsuit was a sham, and the Court saw right through it,\" the statement continued. \"We look forward to the next round, which is seeking attorneys' fees, treble damages and punitive damages against Baldoni, Sarowitz, Nathan, and the other Wayfarer Parties who perpetrated this abusive litigation.\"",
      "\"Good Morning America\" has reached out to Baldoni's lawyers for comment.",
      "Lively first filed a complaint on Dec. 20, 2024, against Baldoni with the California Civil Rights Department accusing him of sexual harassment on the set of the film, which he also directed.",
      "Baldoni responded on Dec. 31, 2024, with the now-dismissed lawsuit against The New York Times for libel and false light invasion of privacy after it published the article about Lively's California complaint.",
      "The lawsuit claimed the Times, which included in its article alleged text messages and email exchanges between Baldoni's publicists Jennifer Abel and Melissa Nathan and the newspaper, had relied on \"cherry-picked\" and altered communications, with details \"stripped of necessary context and deliberately spliced\" to \"mislead.\"",
      "Baldoni's attorney, Bryan Freedman, said at the time that the Times \"cowered to the wants and whims of two powerful 'untouchable' Hollywood elites, disregarding journalistic practices and ethics once befitting of the revered publication by using doctored and manipulated texts and intentionally omitting texts which dispute their chosen PR narrative.\"",
      "A New York Times spokesperson told \"GMA\" at the time that they \"plan to vigorously defend against the lawsuit.\"",
      "\"Good Morning America\" has reached out to The New York TImes for comment on the dismissal.",
      "The same day Baldoni filed his lawsuit against the Times, Lively formalized details from her California complaint into a lawsuit against Baldoni and other defendants for sexual harassment.",
      "Baldoni denied the allegations and he formally filed his $400 million civil lawsuit in January against Lively, Reynolds, Sloane and Sloane's public relations company, Vision PR, for, among other things, extortion and defamation.",
      "The suit claimed Lively pushed a \"false and damaging narrative\" against Baldoni that was \"rife with lies and doctored 'evidence'\" in accusing him of sexual harassment on the set of \"It Ends with Us.\"",
      "It also accused Sloane of spreading \"malicious stories portraying Baldoni as a sexual predator\" and Reynolds of using the term to describe Baldoni in a call with Baldoni's agent, which Baldoni claims led to his rep dropping him as a client. Furthermore, Baldoni's suit claimed he and the other plaintiffs listed were \"the targets of a calculated and vitriolic smear campaign\" by Reynolds and Lively.",
      "LIvely's lawyers responded at the time to Baldoni's lawsuit and called it \"another chapter in the abuser playbook.\"",

      "In his complaint, Baldoni's lawyers claimed that Sloane told the reporter Lively was \"'sexually assaulted' -- an unsubstantiated accusation that not even Lively had gone so far as to claim, designed to destroy Baldoni and his reputation.\"",

      "Firearms are now the leading cause of death in children and teens in the U.S.",
      "A new study published Monday in JAMA Pediatrics found that over 7,000 more children died from firearm-related injuries in the years following a 2010 Supreme Court decision that gave states greater power to set their own gun laws. Most of those deaths occurred in states that opted to make it easier to purchase and carry firearms.",
      "The study, led by Dr. Jeremy Faust, an emergency medicine doctor with Mass General Brigham, found a sharp increase in gun-related deaths among children and teens ages 0 to 17 beginning in 2011, following the 2010 McDonald v. Chicago decision, which ruled that the Second Amendment's right to bear arms was applicable to all states and municipalities and ultimately overturned municipal handgun bans like the one previously enforced in Chicago.",
      "Over the 12-year post-decision period, researchers estimate more than 6,000 excess deaths occurred in states with the most permissive gun laws. Another 1,400 excess deaths occurred in states that made their laws more permissive but were not in the most extreme group.",
      "Meanwhile, four states -- California, New York, Maryland, and Rhode Island, all of which had strict laws -- saw significant drops in pediatric gun deaths.",
      "\"States that made it easier to obtain and carry a firearm had a tradeoff for that, which was a higher rate of mortality in kids,\" Faust said.",
      "Researchers analyzed more than two decades of data, comparing trends in gun-related deaths before and after the legal shift. They adjusted for background trends and compared gun deaths to other causes like motor vehicle accidents, overdoses, and cancer.",
      "The increase in deaths was not part of a broader rise in youth mortality -- it was specific to firearms.",
      "This wasn't just about overall violence going up, Faust told ABC News. The change in gun deaths was far greater than any other trend the study looked at, including deaths involving motor vehicle accidents, overdose and even cancer, he said.",
      "Firearms are now the leading cause of death in children and teens in the United States, a distinction not seen in other developed countries. During the 25-year study period, guns were involved in 4% of all pediatric deaths, outpacing motor vehicle crashes and cancer.",

      "The study also found that the increases in firearm deaths were not confined to a single demographic or region. Rates rose in both urban and rural areas, and among all racial and ethnic groups studied. However, non-Hispanic Black children and teens were disproportionately affected in states that had loosened gun laws.",
      "Most of the pediatric gun deaths were not accidental. They were homicides and suicides, deaths that might have been prevented with safer policies or better storage laws, according to the study. In fact, researchers noted that unintentional shootings made up a small share of overall deaths.",
      "Faust acknowledged that there is no one-size-fits-all solution, and that each state may need tailored approaches to address gun violence. He called for continued research and collaboration with policymakers to determine which gun safety laws save the most lives and emphasized the importance of evidence-based policymaking, comparing gun laws to the nationwide mandates for child car seats.",
      "\"You can't leave the hospital with a newborn unless you have the right car seat in all 50 states,\" he noted. \"That's because vehicle collisions up until a few years ago were the leading cause of mortality outside of infancy.\"",

      "Some staffers fear the rift could make them vulnerable to political retribution.",
      "On the heels of the public war of words between President Donald Trump and Elon Musk, anxiety is mounting among the remaining staff of the Musk-founded Department of Government Efficiency, with some staffers worried not only about their future in government but about potentially becoming future targets of the administration, according to sources.",
      "Some DOGE staffers still embedded across federal agencies fear that the rift and public mudslinging between Trump and Musk could leave them vulnerable to political retribution and damage their future job prospects, multiple sources familiar with internal discussions told ABC News.",
      "Some fear their association with DOGE could make them targets if the feud escalates and Trump moves to investigate the government-slashing initiative that Musk led until he stepped away last week, the sources said.",
      "Others worry that if Trump distances himself from DOGE, their ties to it could become a professional liability, said sources.",
      "Musk, the billionaire CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, grew close to Trump over the last year as he campaigned for Trump's reelection before helping launch DOGE to try to fulfill Trump's goal of slashing the federal government. A quasi-governmental entity, DOGE has generated controversy as it's shuttered government agencies and gained access to sensitive data.",
      "The relationship between the president and the world's richest person erupted into an exchange of insults on social media Thursday as Musk slammed Trump for \"ingratitude\" over the 2024 election while Trump threatened to \"terminate Elon's governmental subsidies and contracts.\"",
      "Amid the spat, War Room host and former Trump adviser Steve Bannon, a longtime ally of Trump who has been critical of Musk for years, has been calling for the president to launch investigations into the billionaire following Thursday's blowup.",
      "\"This is a national security issue,\" Bannon said on his show Thursday. \"We're dealing with a very unstable individual out saying dangerous things about the president of the United States. He must be investigated ... and all government contracts should be suspended.\"",
      "Several of Musk's top allies who served as special government employees with Musk, including Steve Davis, his longtime lieutenant and DOGE operational lead, departed DOGE last week along with Musk. But many DOGE employees remain embedded across federal agencies, including at the Office of Personnel Management, Veterans Affairs, Treasury, IRS, and Social Security Administration, sources said.",
      "Still, Musk's departure marked a major turning point for DOGE and how it will function day to day, given officials like Davis helped lead the DOGE team on a daily basis for months across the federal government.",
      "In Musk's absence, DOGE staff will continue to report to their respective agency leadership, sources said. Last week, the White House said that moving forward the \"DOGE leaders are each and every member of the president's cabinet and the president himself.\"",
      "Sources tell ABC News that some DOGE staffers still working inside the federal government have begun looking for jobs elsewhere. And while there is concern among some about their future career prospects, some major tech companies have expressed interest in hiring DOGE alumni -- with companies like Coinbase even creating a dedicated hiring portal specifically recruiting former DOGE staff.",
      "White House Principal Deputy Press Secretary Harrison Fields told ABC News in a statement, \"The mission of eliminating waste, fraud, and abuse is a part of the DNA of the federal government and will continue under the direction of the President, his cabinet, and agency heads to enhance government efficiency and prioritize responsible stewardship of taxpayer dollars.\"",
      "Asked about any potential investigations into DOGE, a White House adviser said the president was only focused on passing his signature spending bill, known as the \"Big Beautiful Bill.\"",
      "Despite Trump and Musk's public feud, the president has yet to publicly criticize DOGE during the war of words, and has previously lauded the initiative.",
      "At a White House press availability in the Oval Office last week, Trump said Musk \"delivered a colossal change in the old ways of doing business in Washington\" and described DOGE as \"the most sweeping and consequential government reform program in generations\".",
      "Musk, for his part, downplayed the idea that DOGE needed him to survive as he left the Trump administration last week.",
      "\"DOGE is a way of life, like Buddhism,\" he said. \"You wouldn't ask the question, 'Who would lead Buddhism?'\"",

      "The crypto industry is seeing growing support from the Democratic Party, though it's far from unanimous",
      "WASHINGTON -- As President Donald Trump builds a crypto empire \u2014 including hosting a private dinner with top investors at his golf club \u2014 Democrats have united in condemning what they call blatant corruption from the White House.",
      "But the Democratic Party\u2019s own relationship with the emerging crypto industry is far less cut and dried.",
      "Work in the Republican-led Senate to legitimize cryptocurrency by adding guardrails has drawn backing from some Democrats, underscoring growing support for the industry in the party. But divisions have opened over the bill, with many demanding it prevent the Republican president and his family from directly profiting from cryptocurrency.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m all on board with the idea of regulating crypto,\u201d said Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn. \u201cBut at this moment, when cryptocurrency is being so clearly used by Donald Trump to facilitate his corruption, I don\u2019t think you can close your eyes to that when you\u2019re legislating.\u201d",
      "The legislation is moving ahead more rapidly than Congress usually acts when an industry is new. But the big money and campaign donations flowing from cryptocurrency firms have made them a new powerhouse on the political scene, one that's increasingly gaining allies and capturing the attention of lawmakers.",
      "A look at what to know about the industry's clout and the political fight over what's known as the GENIUS Act:",
      "To understand the growing clout of the crypto industry, look no further than the 2024 election. Fairshake, a crypto super political action committee, and its affiliated PACs spent more than $130 million in congressional races.",
      "Fairshake spent roughly $40 million supporting Republican Bernie Moreno in Ohio in an effort to defeat Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown. Brown, who lost to Moreno by more than 3 percentage points, was seen as a chief critic of the industry as the chairman of the Senate Banking Committee.",
      "\u201cDC received a clear message that being anti-crypto is a good way to end your career, as it doesn\u2019t represent the will of the voters,\u201d Brian Armstrong, the CEO of Coinbase, wrote in a social media post the day after the 2024 election.",
      "Coinbase \u2014 the largest crypto exchange in the U.S. and biggest contributor to Fairshake \u2014 does not view support for its industry as partisan, according to Kara Calvert, the company's vice president of U.S. policy. The industry also spent heavily to support Democrats Ruben Gallego and Elissa Slotkin in their races for open Senate seats in battleground states.",
      "Fairshake spent $10 million in support of Slotkin during her successful Senate run against Republican Mike Rodgers, and Slotkin, who won the Michigan race by fewer than 20,000 votes, spoke in favor of crypto on the campaign trail.",
      "Similar dynamics are setting up ahead of 2026 in contested House and Senate races. Fairshake said in January that it already had $116 million in cash on hand aimed at the 2026 midterm elections.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re not slowing down, and everything remains on the table,\u201d Josh Vlasto, a spokesperson for Fairshake, told The Associated Press.",
      "Hours before a May 19 vote to move forward on cryptocurrency legislation in the Senate, an advocacy group tied to Coinbase sent an email to the offices of U.S. senators warning that the vote would count toward their crypto-friendliness scores.",
      "\u201cWhat the spending does is put crypto on the map. It lets members know that this is not a phase, this is real industry, with real dollars, that is developing its hold in Washington,\u201d said Calvert.",
      "A significant number of Democrats, 16, joined Republicans in advancing the crypto legislation. The GENIUS Act would create a new regulatory structure for stablecoins, a type of cryptocurrency typically pegged to the U.S. dollar. It is viewed as a step toward consumer protections and greater legitimacy for the industry.",
      "The sticking point for many Democrats is that while the bill prohibits members of Congress and their families from profiting off stablecoins, it excludes the president from those restrictions.",
      "Trump, once a skeptic of the industry, has vowed in his second term to make the U.S. the global capital of crypto. Meanwhile, he and his family have moved aggressively into nearly every corner of the industry: mining operations, billion-dollar bitcoin purchases, a newly minted stablecoin and a Trump-branded meme coin.",
      "Days after Trump\u2019s interests in the industry became public in early May, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York urged the Democratic caucus to unite and vote against the package to have a stronger hand in negotiations, according to a person familiar with the matter who insisted on anonymity to discuss private discussions.",
      "On May 8, a bloc of Senate Democrats who had previously backed the GENIUS Act reversed course \u2014 ultimately voting to block the bill from advancing. Negotiations between Senate Democrats and Republicans followed.",
      "The new version of the bill is now expected to pass the 100-member Senate this month. Amendments are still possible. Schumer and Sen. Jeff Merkley, D-Ore. are expected to propose one that would bar the president and his family from profiting off stablecoins, though it\u2019s unlikely to pass.",
      "\u201cThere is room for improvements as there often is with a lot of legislation. But with this in particular, we\u2019ve got issues with the president,\u201d said Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona \u201cHaving said that, this was negotiated with Democrats and Republicans. We got to a place. We voted on it. I expect this is the version we\u2019re going to pass.\u201d",
      "Still, the legislation is stirring unease. Schumer, asked if he\u2019s urging members to vote against the bill, noted that he has opposed the legislation and said \u201cthere\u2019s division in our caucus on that issue.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a gaping hole in this bill that everybody sees,\" Murphy said. \"After it\u2019s passed, it will be illegal for me to issue a cryptocurrency, but it\u2019s legal for the president of the United States.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf this bill passes, we kind of go from a dirt road to a paved road,\u201d he said.",
      "If the Senate approves the stablecoin legislation, the bill will still need to clear the House before reaching the president\u2019s desk.",
      "Crypto advocates say the next priority is pushing Congress for market structure legislation, a far more sweeping effort than simply regulating stablecoins.",
      "\u201cStablecoin is one step of the path. Then you need market structure. We're hopeful that the Senate works together to pass something quickly,\u201d Calvert said.",
      "Some Democrats view the legislation as a chance to impose basic guardrails on a rapidly growing industry that's particularly popular among men and younger voters, two groups that drifted from the party in 2024.",

      "\u201cTourism is a big catalyst, and so it\u2019s very important that the bans get lifted,\u201d said Laura Khazen Lahoud, the country's tourism minister.",
      "On the highway leading to the Beirut airport, once-ubiquitous banners touting Hezbollah\u2019s leadership have been replaced with commercial billboards and posters that read \u201ca new era for Lebanon.\u201d In the center of Beirut, and especially in neighborhoods that hope to attract tourists, political posters are coming down, and police and army patrols are on the rise.",
      "There are signs of thawing relations with some Gulf neighbors. The United Arab Emirates and Kuwait have lifted yearslong travel bans.",
      "All eyes are now on Saudi Arabia, a regional political and economic powerhouse, to see if it will follow suit, according to Lahoud and other Lebanese officials. A key sticking point is security, these officials say. Although a ceasefire with Israel has been in place since November, near-daily airstrikes have continued in southern and eastern Lebanon, where Hezbollah over the years had built its political base and powerful military arsenal.",
      "As vital as tourism is \u2014 it accounted for almost 20% of Lebanon's economy before it tanked in 2019 \u2014 the country's leaders say it is just one piece of a larger puzzle they are trying to put back together.",
      "Lebanon\u2019s agricultural and industrial sectors are in shambles, suffering a major blow in 2021, when Saudi Arabia banned their exports after accusing Hezbollah of smuggling drugs into Riyadh. Years of economic dysfunction have left the country's once-thriving middle class in a state of desperation.",
      "The World Bank says poverty nearly tripled in Lebanon over the past decade, affecting close to half its population of nearly 6 million. To make matters worse, inflation is soaring, with the Lebanese pound losing 90% of its value, and many families lost their savings when banks collapsed.",
      "Tourism is seen by Lebanon's leaders as the best way to kickstart the reconciliation needed with Gulf countries -- and only then can they move on to exports and other economic growth opportunities.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the thing that makes most sense, because that\u2019s all Lebanon can sell now,\u201d said Sami Zoughaib, research manager at The Policy Initiative, a Beirut-based think tank.",
      "With summer still weeks away, flights to Lebanon are already packed with expats and locals from countries that overturned their travel bans, and hotels say bookings have been brisk.",
      "At the event hosted last month by the tourism ministry, the owner of the St. Georges Hotel, Fady El-Khoury, beamed. The hotel, owned by his father in its heyday, has acutely felt Lebanon's ups and downs over the decades, closing and reopening multiple times because of wars. \u201cI have a feeling that the country is coming back after 50 years,\u201d he said.",
      "On a recent weekend, as people crammed the beaches of the northern city of Batroun, and jet skis whizzed along the Mediterranean, local business people sounded optimistic that the country was on the right path.",
      "\u201cWe are happy, and everyone here is happy,\u201d said Jad Nasr, co-owner of a private beach club. \u201cAfter years of being boycotted by the Arabs and our brothers in the Gulf, we expect this year for us to always be full.\u201d",
      "Still, tourism is not a panacea for Lebanon's economy, which for decades has suffered from rampant corruption and waste.",
      "Lebanon has been in talks with the International Monetary Fund for years over a recovery plan that would include billions in loans and require the country to combat corruption, restructure its banks, and bring improvements to a range of public services, including electricity and water.",
      "Without those and other reforms, Lebanon's wealthy neighbors will lack confidence to invest there, experts said. A tourism boom alone would serve as a \u201cmorphine shot that would only temporarily ease the pain\" rather than stop the deepening poverty in Lebanon, Zoughaib said.",
      "The tourism minister, Lahoud, agreed, saying a long-term process has only just begun.",
      "\"But we\u2019re talking about subjects we never talked about before,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I think the whole country has realized that war doesn\u2019t serve anyone, and that we really need our economy to be back and flourish again.\u201d",

      "The projects are part of a series of personal touches that Trump, a real estate developer turned politician, has added or is adding to the Executive Mansion and its grounds since he opened his second term in January. The projects also include new artwork of himself on walls and gold-toned flourishes in the Oval Office. He also wants to add a ballroom.",

The project is set to be completed in about two months, or the first half of August, said the official, who was not authorized to comment publicly on intended changes to the Executive Mansion and spoke on the condition of anonymity.",
      "After stepping off the helicopter, Trump walked over to a bulldozer that was on the South Lawn to start digging a foundation for one of two flagpoles he promised in April. One flagpole will be added to the South Lawn, and the second will be installed on the North Lawn, he said.",
      "Trump said he was installing two \u201cbeautiful\u201d flagpoles \u201cpaid for by Trump\u201d on the grounds because \u201cthey\u2019ve needed flagpoles for 200 years.\u201d",
      "The American and POW/MIA flags fly on the roof of the White House every day.",

      "Oklahoma prosecutors say they will retry longtime death row inmate Richard Glossip a third time for his role in the 1997 killing of his former boss",
      "OKLAHOMA CITY -- Oklahoma prosecutors will retry longtime death row inmate Richard Glossip a third time for his role in the 1997 killing of his former boss, Attorney General Gentner Drummond said Monday.",
      "The decision comes after the U.S. Supreme Court in February tossed Glossip\u2019s conviction and death sentence. The court determined the original prosecutors in the case allowed a key witness to give testimony they knew to be false, violating Glossip\u2019s constitutional right to a fair trial.",
      "Glossip, who had long maintained his innocence, was twice convicted and sentenced to death for the killing of Oklahoma City motel owner Barry Van Treese in what prosecutors alleged was a murder-for-hire killing. Another man, Justin Sneed, admitted robbing Van Treese and beating him to death with a baseball bat, but testified that he did so after Glossip promised to pay him $10,000. Sneed was the state\u2019s key witness against Glossip and was sentenced to life in prison.",
      "After the Supreme Court\u2019s decision, Drummond, acknowledged retrying the case more than 25 years later would be difficult. Drummond had taken the unusual step of asking the court to overturn Glossip\u2019s conviction, arguing that while he believed Glossip had a role in the killing, he did not believe he had received a fair trial.",
      "\u201cI do not believe Richard Glossip is innocent,\u201d Drummond said after the high court\u2019s ruling. \u201cThe mission of this office is to seek justice, not to defend the prosecution.\u201d",
      "Justice Sonia Sotomayor, who wrote for five of the high court's justices, said additional prosecutorial misconduct, including interfering with Sneed\u2019s testimony, destroying evidence and withholding witness statements, further undermined confidence in the verdict.",
      "During his time on death row, courts in Oklahoma set nine different execution dates for Glossip, and he came so close to being put to death that he had three separate last meals. In 2015, he was being held in a cell next to Oklahoma\u2019s execution chamber, waiting to be strapped to a gurney and injected with drugs that would kill him.",
      "But the scheduled time for his execution came and went. And behind the walls of the Oklahoma State Penitentiary, prison officials were scrambling after learning one of the lethal drugs they received to carry out the procedure didn\u2019t match the execution protocols. The drug mix-up ultimately led to a nearly seven-year moratorium on executions in Oklahoma.",

      "The suit announced Monday argues that returning the triggers would violate federal law, pose a threat to residents and law enforcement and worsen gun violence. It was filed in federal court in Maryland.",
      "There had been several legal battles over the devices, which replace the typical trigger on an AR-15-style rifle. The Biden administration had previously argued the triggers qualify as machine guns under federal law because constant finger pressure on the triggers will keep a rifle firing, essentially creating an illegal machine gun.",

      "If President Donald Trump's budget proposal wins final congressional approval, funding will be slashed for tribal colleges and universities",
      "In President Donald Trump's budget request, he's proposing slashing funding for tribal colleges and universities, including eliminating support for the country's only federally funded college for contemporary Native American arts.",
      "If the budget is approved by Congress, beginning in October, the more than $13 million in annual appropriations for the Institute for American Indian Arts in Santa Fe, New Mexico, would be reduced to zero. It would be the first time in nearly 40 years that the congressionally chartered school would not receive federal support, said Robert Martin, the school's president.",
      "\u201cYou can\u2019t wipe out 63 years of our history and what we\u2019ve accomplished with one budget,\u201d Martin said on Friday. \u201cI just can\u2019t understand or comprehend why they would do something like this.\u201d",
      "The college, founded in 1962, has provided affordable education to thousands of Native artists and culture bearers, including U.S. poet laureate Joy Harjo, painter T.C. Cannon and bestselling novelist Tommy Orange. It's the only four-year degree fine arts institution in the world devoted to contemporary Native American and Alaskan Native arts, according to its website.",
      "Martin said he has spoken with members of Congress from both major political parties who have assured him they'll work to keep the institute's budget level for the next fiscal year, but he worries the morale of students and staff will be affected. Martin said he also spoke with staff in the office of U.S. Rep. Tom Cole, a member of the Chickasaw Nation and chairman of the House Appropriations Committee. Cole, a Republican and former member of IAIA's board of trustees and a longtime advocate in Congress for funding that supports tribal citizens, was unavailable for comment.",
      "Breana Brave Heart, a junior studying arts and business, said the proposal shocked her and made her wonder: \u201cWill I be able to continue my education at IAIA with these budget cuts?\u201d Brave Heart said she started organizing with other students to contact members of Congress. \u201cIAIA is under attack,\" she said, \"and I need other students to know this.\u201d",
      "Martin said that amid the Republican Trump administration's crackdown on federal policies and funding that support diversity, equity and inclusion, trust responsibilities and treaty rights owed to tribal nations have also come under attack.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a problem for us and many other organizations when you\u2019ve got that DEI initiative which really is not applicable to us, because we\u2019re not a racial category, we\u2019re a political status as a result of the treaties,\" he said. \u201cWe\u2019re easily identified as what this administration might refer to as a \u2018woke\u2019.\u201d",
      "Democratic Sen. Ben Ray Luj\u00e1n of New Mexico said the cuts are another example of the Trump administration \u201cturning its back on Native communities and breaking our trust responsibilities.\u201d",
      "\"As a member of the Senate Indian Affairs Committee, I remain committed to keeping IAIA fully funded and will continue working with appropriators and the New Mexico Congressional Delegation to ensure its future,\u201d Luj\u00e1n said in a statement to The Associated Press.",
      "The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "The congressional budget bill includes roughly $3.75 trillion in tax cuts, extending the expiring 2017 individual income tax breaks and temporarily adding new ones that Trump campaigned on. The revenue loss would be partially offset by nearly $1.3 trillion in reduced federal spending elsewhere, namely through Medicaid and food assistance.",
      "A Jan. 30 order from the Interior Department titled \u201cEnding DEI Programs and Gender Ideology Extremism\u201d stated that any efforts to eradicate diversity, equity and inclusion in the department\u2019s policy should exclude trust obligations to tribal nations.",
      "However, earlier this year, several staff members at the other two congressionally chartered schools in the country \u2014 the Southwestern Indian Polytechnic Institute in Albuquerque, New Mexico, and Haskell Indian Nations University in Kansas \u2014 were laid off as part of Trump's push to downsize the federal workforce. In a lawsuit filed in March, both institutions reported that some staff and faculty were rehired, but the Bureau of Indian Education notified those people that might be temporary and they may be laid off again.",
      "\u201cIt shows what a president\u2019s values and priorities are, and that\u2019s been hard,\u201d said Ahniwake Rose, president of the American Indian Higher Education Consortium, an organization that represents more than 30 Tribal Colleges and Universities. \"That\u2019s been hard for our staff, our students, our faculty to see that the priority of the administration through the Department of Interior might not be on tribal colleges.\"",
      "In its budget request this year, the Interior Department is proposing reducing funding to the BIE's post secondary programs by more than 80%, and that would have a devastating affect on tribal colleges and universities, or TCUs, which rely on the federal government for most of their funding, said Rose. Most TCUs offer tribal citizens a tuition-free higher education, she said, and funding them is a moral and fiduciary responsibility the federal government owes tribal nations.",
      "In the many treaties the U.S. signed with tribal nations, it outlined several rights owed to them \u2014 like land rights, health care and education through departments established later, like the BIE. Trust responsibilities are the legal and moral obligations the U.S. has to protect and uphold those rights.",
      "The Interior Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",

      "The Southern Baptist Convention, the nation's largest Protestant denomination, is also expected to debate controversies within its own house during its annual meeting Tuesday and Wednesday \u2014 such as a proposed ban on churches with women pastors. There are also calls to defund the organization\u2019s public policy arm, whose anti-abortion stance hasn\u2019t extended to supporting criminal charges for women having abortions.",
      "In a denomination where support for President Donald Trump is strong, there is little on the advance agenda referencing specific actions by Trump since taking office in January in areas such as tariffs, immigration or the pending budget bill containing cuts in taxes, food aid and Medicaid.",
      "Southern Baptists will be meeting on the 40th anniversary of another Dallas annual meeting. An epic showdown took place when a record-shattering 45,000 church representatives clashed in what became a decisive blow in the takeover of the convention \u2014 and its seminaries and other agencies \u2014 by a more conservative faction that was also aligned with the growing Christian conservative movement in presidential politics.",
      "The 1985 showdown was \u201cthe hinge convention in terms of the old and the new in the SBC,\u201d said Albert Mohler, who became a key agent in the denomination's rightward shift as longtime president of the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary in Louisville, Kentucky.",
      "Attendance this week will likely be a fraction of 1985's, but that meeting's influence will be evident. Any debates will be among solidly conservative members.",
      "Many of the proposed resolutions \u2014 on gambling, pornography, sex, gender and marriage \u2014 reflect long-standing positions of the convention, though they are especially pointed in their demands on the wider political world. They are proposed by the official Committee on Resolutions, whose recommendations typically get strong support.",
      "A proposed resolution says legislators have a duty to \u201cpass laws that reflect the truth of creation and natural law \u2014 about marriage, sex, human life, and family\u201d and to oppose laws contradicting \u201cwhat God has made plain through nature and Scripture.\u201d",
      "To some outside observers, such language is theocratic.",
      "\u201cWhen you talk about God\u2019s design for anything, there\u2019s not a lot of room for compromise,\u201d said Nancy Ammerman, professor emerita of sociology of religion at Boston University. She was an eyewitness to the Dallas meeting and author of \u201cBaptist Battles,\u201d a history of the 1980s controversy between theological conservatives and moderates.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s not a lot of room for people who don\u2019t have the same understanding of who God is and how God operates in the world,\" she said.",
      "Mohler said the resolutions reflect a divinely created order that predates the writing of the Scriptures and is affirmed by them. He said the Christian church has always asserted that the created order \u201cis binding on all persons, in all times, everywhere.\u201d",
      "Separate resolutions decry pornography and sports betting as destructive, calling for the former to be banned and the latter curtailed.",
      "At least some of these political stances are in the realm of plausibility at a time when their conservative allies control all levers of power in Washington and many have embraced aspects of a Christian nationalist agenda.",
      "A Southern Baptist, Mike Johnson, is speaker of the House of Representatives and third in line to the presidency.",
      "At least one Supreme Court justice, Clarence Thomas, has called for revisiting the 2015 Supreme Court decision legalizing same-sex marriage nationwide. Other religious conservatives \u2014 including some in the Catholic postliberal movement, which has influenced Vice President JD Vance \u2014 have promoted the view that a robust government should legislate morality, such as banning pornography while easing church-state separation.",
      "And conservatives of various stripes have echoed one of the resolution's call for pro-natalist policies and its decrying of \u201cwillful childlessness which contributes to a declining fertility rate.\u201d",
      "Some preconvention talk has focused on defunding the Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission, the Southern Baptist Convention's public policy arm, which has been accused of being ineffective. Ten former Southern Baptist presidents endorsed its continued funding, though one other called for the opposite.",
      "A staunchly conservative group, the Center for Baptist Leadership, has posted online articles critical of the commission, which is adamantly anti-abortion but has opposed state laws criminalizing women seeking abortions.",
      "The commission has appealed to Southern Baptists for support, citing its advocacy for religious liberty and against abortion and transgender identity.",
      "\u201cWithout the ERLC, you will send the message to our nation's lawmakers and the public at large that the SBC has chosen to abandon the public square at a time when the Southern Baptist voice is most needed,\u201d said a video statement from the commission president, Brent Leatherwood.",
      "A group of Southern Baptist ethnic groups and leaders signed a statement in April citing concern over Trump's immigration crackdown, saying it has hurt church attendance and raised fears. \u201cLaw and order are necessary, but enforcement must be accompanied with compassion that doesn\u2019t demonize those fleeing oppression, violence, and persecution,\u201d the statement said.",
      "The Center for Baptist Leadership, however, denounced the denominational Baptist Press for working to \u201cweaponize empathy\u201d in its reporting on the statement and Leatherwood for supporting it.",
      "Texas pastor Dwight McKissic, a Black pastor who shares many of the Southern Baptist Convention's conservative stances, criticized what he sees as a backlash against the commission, \u201cthe most racially progressive entity in the SBC.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe SBC is transitioning from an evangelical organization to a fundamentalist organization,\u201d he posted on the social media site X. \u201cFewer and fewer Black churches will make the transition with them.\"",
      "An amendment to ban churches with women pastors failed in 2024 after narrowly failing to gain a two-thirds supermajority for two consecutive years. It is expected to be reintroduced.",
      "The denomination\u2019s belief statement says the office of pastor is limited to men, but there remain disagreements over whether this applies only to the lead pastor or to assistants as well. In recent years, the convention began purging churches that either had women as lead pastors or asserted that they could serve that role. But when an SBC committee this year retained a South Carolina megachurch with a woman on its pastoral staff, some argued this proved the need for a constitutional amendment. (The church later quit the denomination of its own accord.)",
      "The meeting comes as the Southern Baptist Convention continues its long membership slide, down 2% in 2024 from the previous year in its 18th consecutive annual decline. The organization now reports a membership of 12.7 million members, still the largest among Protestant denominations, many of whom are shrinking faster.",
      "More promising are Southern Baptists' baptism numbers \u2014 a key spiritual vital sign. They stand at 250,643, exceeding pre-pandemic levels and, at least for now, reversing a long slide.",

      "The Senate has set an ambitious timeline to pass President Donald Trump\u2019s sweeping legislation to cut taxes and spending",
      "WASHINGTON -- The Senate has set an ambitious timeline for passing President Donald Trump\u2019s sweeping legislation to cut taxes and spending. But getting it on the Republican president's desk by July 4 will require some big decisions, and soon.",
      "Republican senators are airing concerns about different parts of the legislation, including cuts to Medicaid, changes to food aid and the impact on the deficit. To push the bill to passage, Senate Majority Leader John Thune of South Dakota and other negotiators will need to find a compromise that satisfies both ends of their conference \u2014 and that can still satisfy the House, which passed the bill last month by only one vote.",
      "A look at some of the groups and senators who leaders will have to convince as they work to push Trump\u2019s \u201cbig, beautiful\u201d bill toward a Senate vote:",
      "Every Republican senator represents a state with a rural constituency \u2014 and some of their states are among the most rural in the country. Many in those less-populated areas rely heavily on Medicaid for health care, leading several of them to warn that the changes to the program in the bill could be devastating to communities that are already struggling.",
      "Of particular concern is a freeze on a so-called provider tax that some states use to help pay for large portions of their Medicaid programs. The extra tax often leads to higher payments from the federal government, which critics say is a loophole that allows states to inflate their budgets. Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri and several others have argued that freezing that tax revenue would hurt rural hospitals, in particular.",
      "\u201cHospitals will close,\u201d Hawley said last month. \u201cIt\u2019s that simple. And that pattern will replicate in states across the country.\u201d",
      "Alabama Sen. Tommy Tuberville said Thursday that provider taxes in his state are \u201cthe money we use for Medicaid.\u201d",
      "\u201cYou start cutting that out, we\u2019ve got big problems,\u201d Tuberville said. Eliminating those taxes \u201cmight lose some folks.\u201d",
      "At the same time, Republican senators have little interest in a House-passed provision that spends more money by raising a cap on state and local tax deductions, known as SALT. The higher cap traditionally benefits more urban areas in states with high taxes, such as New York and California.",
      "The House included the new cap after New York Republicans threatened to oppose the bill, but Senate Republicans uniformly dislike it. \u201cI think there\u2019s going to have to be some adjustment\u201d on the SALT provision, Thune said Wednesday, noting that \u201csenators are just in a very different place\u201d from the House.",
      "The House-passed bill would also shift some Medicaid and food stamp costs to states, a change that has the former governors in the Senate, in particular, worried.",
      "West Virginia Sen. Jim Justice, who was governor of his state for eight years before his election to the Senate last year, said he favors many aspects of the bill. He supports the new work requirements for Medicaid and food stamp recipients, the restrictions on benefits for immigrants who are in the country illegally and the efforts to cut down on fraud. \u201cThere\u2019s real savings there,\u201d Justice said. \u201cBut then we ought to stop.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re on our way to cannibalizing ourselves,\u201d Justice said. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to hurt kids and hurt our families.\u201d",
      "The provisions stirring the most unease would require states to pay a higher share of the cost for food stamps \u2014 known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP. States would pay at least 5% of the cost of the benefits, with states that have high error rates in the program paying even more. The House bill would also shift additional administrative costs for the program to states.",
      "North Dakota Sen. John Hoeven, also a former governor, said senators are working to get feedback from current governors and may propose some \u201cincentive-oriented ideas\u201d instead of a penalty for the high error rates.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t know if the states have really looked at the impacts of some of this yet,\u201d Hoeven said.",
      "Tuberville, who is running for governor of Alabama next year, said the program should be reformed instead of shifting costs.",
      "\u201cI know what our budget is and what we can afford, and we can\u2019t start a federal program and then say, \u2018Oh, let\u2019s, let\u2019s send it back to the states and let them take a big hunk of it,\u2019\u201d Tuberville said. \u201cI mean, that\u2019s not the way we do it.\u201d",
      "Thune needs to bring Republican moderates on board with the bill, including Maine Sen. Susan Collins and Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski. Both have reservations with the Medicaid cuts, among other things.",
      "Collins said she wants to review how the SNAP changes will affect her state. Murkowski has questioned expiring subsidies for the Affordable Care Act and whether they might be needed if people are kicked off Medicaid.",
      "Last month, Murkowski said she wants to make sure that people are not negatively impacted by the bill, \u201cso we\u2019re looking at it through that lens for both Medicaid and on energy.\u201d",
      "Murkowski and Sens. Thom Tillis of North Carolina, John Curtis of Utah and Jerry Moran of Kansas have also supported energy tax credits that would be phased out quickly under the House bill. The four senators argued that the quick repeal creates uncertainty for businesses and could raise prices for consumers.",
      "Sens. Rand Paul of Kentucky, Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, Mike Lee of Utah and Rick Scott of Florida have argued the legislation does not save enough money and threatened to vote against it.",
      "Paul is considered the least likely to support the measure. He says he won\u2019t vote for it if it raises the debt ceiling \u2014 a key priority for GOP leaders in both the House and the Senate. The package would raise the nation\u2019s debt limit by $4 trillion to allow more borrowing to pay the nation's bills, as the Treasury Department says the limit needs to be raised by the middle of July.",
      "Johnson has been railing against the legislation since it was unveiled in the House, arguing that it does little to reduce government spending over time. He took those arguments to Trump last week at a meeting between the president and members of the Senate Finance Committee.",
      "After the meeting, Johnson said he would continue to argue that the bill needs to do more to cut costs. But he said he came away with the recognition that he needed to be \u201cmore positive\u201d as Trump exerts political pressure on Republicans to pass it.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re a long ways from making the deficit curve bend down, but I recognize that\u2019s going to take time,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cThe truth is, there are a lot of good things in this bill that I absolutely support. I want it to succeed.\u201d",

      "Yes, that Weiner: The guy whose once-promising political career was derailed by sexting scandals and then seemingly ended forever when he was imprisoned for sending sexually explicit messages to a 15-year-old girl.",
      "But now Weiner's hoping to convince enough voters in lower Manhattan that he deserves yet another chance in a comeback bid for a seat on the New York City Council.",
      "On a recent weekday at an apartment complex in the Lower East Side, the former congressman, 60, was knocking on doors, reintroducing himself to voters and reminding them about the election. And, on this Thursday at least, the would-be constituents aren\u2019t slamming their doors in the registered sex offender\u2019s face.",

      "And so it went as Weiner walked down floor after floor, knocking on doors. A quick hello here, a fast thank you there. Campaign literature flowed into hands. People seemed happy to see him.",
      "It isn\u2019t always this friendly. Weiner said he still struggles with how to speak about his scandal, calling it the \u201cfundamental, unsolvable problem of the campaign.\u201d",
      "\u201cSometimes it\u2019s with like real painful, kind of, honesty about what happened and sometimes it\u2019s a little bit defensive, and sometimes, like, a woman at this street fair last week, she\u2019s like, \u2018I love you and I\u2019m going to vote for you, but I voted for you before and how can I ever trust you?\u2019\u201d he said.",

      "Weiner, a brash and ambitious politician whose New York accent and wily, kinetic style made for solid theater on the House floor, was once someone worth watching in the Democratic Party. Back then, he represented a district in parts of Brooklyn and Queens.",
      "His latest return to the political stage \u2014 this time for a City Council seat that covers Union Square and the East Village \u2014 pits him against state lawmaker Harvey Epstein, whose name's unfortunate proximity to convicted sex offenders Jeffrey Epstein and Harvey Weinstein inspired a \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d bit, along with a handful of other low-key candidates.",
      "The primary, on June 24, is considered the defining contest of the election, given the district's heavy Democratic bent. It's hard to know how it'll turn out in a low-turnout, early-summer primary where there's no deep political polling.",

    "story": [
      "The FBI under the leadership of Director Kash Patel has made fighting violent crime and illegal immigration top priorities",
      "WASHINGTON -- FOR MOVEMENT AT 12:01 A.M. ON MONDAY JUNE 9TH",
      "When the FBI arrested an accused leader of the MS-13 gang, Kash Patel was there to announce the case, trumpeting it as a step toward returning \"our communities to safety.\u201d",
      "Weeks later, when the Justice Department announced the seizure of $510 million in illegal narcotics bound for the U.S, the FBI director joined other law enforcement leaders in front of a Coast Guard ship in Florida and stacks of intercepted drugs to highlight the haul.",
      "His presence was meant to signal the premium the FBI is placing on combating violent crime, drug trafficking and illegal immigration, concerns that have leapfrogged up the agenda in what current and former law enforcement officials say amounts to a rethinking of priorities and mission at a time when the country is also confronting increasingly sophisticated national security threats from abroad.",
      "A revised FBI priority list on its website places \u201cCrush Violent Crime\u201d at the top, bringing the bureau into alignment with the vision of President Donald Trump, who has made a crackdown on illegal immigration, cartels and transnational gangs a cornerstone of his administration. Patel has said he wants to \u201cget back to the basics.\u201d His deputy, Dan Bongino, says the FBI is returning to \u201cits roots.\u201d",
      "Patel says the FBI remains focused on some of the same concerns, including China, that have dominated headlines in recent years, and the bureau said in a statement that its commitment to investigating international and domestic terrorism has not changed. That intensifying threat was laid bare over the past month by a spate of violent acts, most recently a Molotov cocktail attack on a Colorado crowd by an Egyptian man who authorities say overstayed his visa and yelled \u201cFree Palestine.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe FBI continuously analyzes the threat landscape and allocates resources and personnel in alignment with that analysis and the investigative needs of the Bureau,\u201d the FBI said in a statement. \u201cWe make adjustments and changes based on many factors and remain flexible as various needs arise.\u201d",
      "Signs of restructuring abound. The Justice Department has disbanded an FBI-led task force on foreign influence and the bureau has moved to dissolve a key public corruption squad in its Washington field office, people familiar with the matter have told The Associated Press. The Trump administration, meanwhile, has proposed steep budget cuts for the FBI, and there\u2019s been significant turnover in leadership ranks as some veteran agents with years of experience have been pushed from their positions.",
      "Some former officials are concerned the stepped-up focus on violent crime and immigration \u2014 areas already core to the mission of agencies including the Drug Enforcement Administration and Immigration and Customs Enforcement \u2014 risks deflecting attention from some of the complicated criminal and national security threats for which the bureau has long borne primary if not exclusive responsibility for investigating.",
      "\u201cIf you\u2019re looking down five feet in front of you, looking for gang members and I would say lower-level criminals, you\u2019re going to miss some of the more sophisticated strategic issues that may be already present or emerging,\u201d said Chris Piehota, who retired from the FBI in 2020 as an executive assistant director.",
      "Enforcement of immigration laws has long been the principal jurisdiction of immigration agents tasked with arresting people in the U.S. illegally along with border agents who police points of entry.",
      "Since Trump's inauguration, the FBI has assumed greater responsibility for that work, saying it's made over 10,000 immigration-related arrests. Patel has highlighted the arrests on social media, doubling down on the administration's promise to prioritize immigration enforcement.",
      "Agents have been dispatched to visit migrant children who crossed the U.S-Mexico border without parents in what officials say is an effort to ensure their safety. Field offices have been directed to commit manpower to immigration enforcement.",
      "The Justice Department has instructed the FBI to review files for information about those illegally in the U.S. and provide it to the Department of Homeland Security unless doing so would compromise an investigation. And photos on the FBI\u2019s Instagram account depict agents with covered faces and tactical gear alongside detained subjects, with a caption saying the FBI is \u201cramping up\u201d efforts with immigration agents to locate \u201cdangerous criminals.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re giving you about five minutes to cooperate,\u201d Bongino said on Fox News about illegal immigrants. \u201cIf you\u2019re here illegally, five minutes, you\u2019re out.\u201d",
      "That's a rhetorical shift from prior leadership. Though Patel\u2019s direct predecessor, Christopher Wray, warned about the flow of fentanyl through the southern border and the possibility migrants determined to commit terrorism could illegally cross through, he did not characterize immigration enforcement as core to the FBI's mission.",
      "There's precedent for the FBI to rearrange priorities to meet evolving threats, though for the past two decades countering terrorism has remained a constant atop the agenda.",
      "Then-Director Robert Mueller transformed the FBI after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks into a national security, intelligence-gathering agency. Agents were reassigned from investigations into drugs, violent crime and white-collar fraud to fight terrorism. In a top 10 priority list from 2002, protecting the U.S. from terrorism was first. Fighting violent crime was near the bottom, above only supporting law enforcement partners and technology upgrades.",
      "The FBI\u2019s new list of priorities places \u201cCrush Violent Crime\u201d as a top pillar alongside \u201cDefend the Homeland,\" though FBI leaders have also sought to stress that counterterrorism remains the bureau's principal mandate.",
      "Wray often said he was hard-pressed to think of a time when the FBI was facing so many elevated threats at once. At the time of his departure last January, the FBI was grappling with elevated terrorism concerns; Iranian assassination plots on U.S. soil; Chinese spying and hacking of Americans' cell phones; ransomware attacks against hospitals; and Russian influence operations aimed at sowing disinformation.",
      "Testifying before lawmakers last month, Patel took care to note the surge in terrorism threats following the Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel by Hamas and a Chinese espionage threat he said had yielded investigations in each of the bureau\u2019s offices. But the accomplishments he dwelled on first concerned efforts to \u201ctake dangerous criminals off our streets,\u201d including the arrests of three suspects on the \u201cTen Most Wanted\u201d list, and large drug seizures.",
      "Rounding out the priority list are two newcomers: \u201cRebuild Public Trust\u201d and \u201cFierce Organizational Accountability.\u201d",
      "Those reflect claims amplified by Patel and Bongino that the bureau had become politicized through its years of investigations of Trump, whose Mar-a-Lago home was searched by agents for classified documents in 2022. Close allies of Trump, both men have committed to disclose files from past investigations, including into Russian election interference and the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol, that have fueled grievances against the bureau.",
      "They've also pledged to examine matters that have captivated attention in conservative circles, like the leak of a draft Supreme Court opinion that overturned Roe v. Wade. Employees have spent hours poring over documents from the sex trafficking case against financier Jeffrey Epstein, a favorite subject of conspiracy theorists, to prepare them for release.",
      "Patel had forecast his interest in rejiggering priorities long before becoming director, including by saying that if he ran the bureau, he would \u201clet good cops be good cops\u201d and push agents into the field. A critic as a House Republican staffer of the FBI's Trump-Russia investigation, which he calls an example of politicized law enforcement, he had said that he would support breaking off the FBI's \u201cintel shops\u201d to focus on crime-fighting.",
      "James Gagliano, a retired FBI supervisor, said he would like to see more specific information about the new priorities but was heartened by an enhanced violent crime focus so long as other initiatives weren\u2019t abandoned.",
      "\u201cMission priorities change,\u201d Gagliano said. \u201cThe threat matrix changes. You\u2019ve got to constantly get out in front of that.\u201d",
      "The Trump administration has touted several terrorism successes, including the arrests of a suspected participant in a suicide bombing at the Kabul airport that killed 13 American servicemembers and of an ex-Michigan National Guard member on charges of plotting a military base attack on behalf of the Islamic State.",
      "But the administration is also employing a broad definition of what it believes constitutes terrorism.",
      "FBI and Justice Department officials see the fight against transnational gangs as part of their counterterrorism mandate, taking advantage of the Trump administration\u2019s designation of the violent street gangs MS-13 and Tren de Aragua as foreign terrorist organizations to bring terrorism-related charges against defendants, including a Venezuelan man suspected of being a high-ranking TdA member and a Utah father-son suspected of providing material support to a Mexican cartel \u2014 a charge typically used for cases involving groups like the Islamic State and al-Qaida.",
      "A former Justice Department terrorism prosecutor, Patel has called the FBI\u2019s Joint Terrorism Task Forces \u2014 interagency units in the bureau\u2019s 55 field offices \u2014 as \u201cshining examples\u201d of its mission. Those task forces spent years pursuing suspects in the Capitol riot but have now been enlisted to track down cartel members, he has said.",
      "After an Egyptian man whose work authorization in the U.S. had expired was arrested on charges of using a homemade flamethrower and Molotov cocktails to attack a group drawing attention to Israeli hostages in Gaza, administration officials held up the case as proof of their philosophy that immigration enforcement is tantamount to protecting national security.",
      "The FBI says its domestic terrorism investigations continue uninterrupted, though Patel at times has discussed the threat in different terms than Wray, who led the bureau as it investigated the Capitol riot and who cited it as evidence of the dangers of homegrown extremists. At hearings last month, Patel pointed to a string of arsons and vandalism acts at Tesla dealerships as domestic terrorism acts that commanded the FBI's resources and attention.",
      "As it reconfigures its resources, the FBI has moved to reassign some agents focused on domestic terrorism to a new task force set up to investigate the Oct. 7 Hamas attack and its aftermath, according to people familiar with the matter who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss personnel moves.",
      "One national security concern Patel has preached continuity on in public is the threat from China, which he said in a recent Fox News interview keeps him up at night. Wray often called China the gravest long-term threat to national security, and when he stepped aside in January the FBI was contending with an espionage operation that gave officials in Beijing access to private texts and phone conversations of an unknown number of Americans.",
      "There are signs of a broader national security realignment.",
      "A task force tracking foreign influence, like Russia\u2019s attempts to interfere in American democracy, was disbanded and the Justice Department has scaled back criminal enforcement of a statute requiring registration of U.S. lobbying on behalf of foreign entities.",
      "All of that concerns retired FBI supervisor Frank Montoya, a longtime counterintelligence official who says fentanyl and drug cartels are not \u201cexistential\u201d threats in the same way Russia and China are. When it comes to complicated, interagency espionage work, the FBI, he said, has always \u201cbeen the glue that made it all work.\u201d",
      "Patel makes no apologies for priorities he says come from the White House.",
      "\u201cPresident Trump has set some priorities out in a new focus for federal law enforcement,\u201d he has said. \u201cThe FBI has heard those directions, and we are determined to deliver on our crime-fighting and national security mission with renewed vigor.\u201d",

They declined to comment via their attorney.",

      "The U.N. Ocean Conference is opening in France as pressure mounts to turn promises into action on protecting the ocean",
      "NICE, France -- The third United Nations Ocean Conference opens Monday as pressure mounts for nations to turn decades of promises into real protection for the sea.",
      "The summit comes as just 2.7% of the ocean is effectively protected from destructive extractive activities, according to the nonprofit Marine Conservation Institute. That's far below the target agreed under the \u201c30x30\u201d pledge to conserve 30% of land and sea by 2030.",
      "Atop this year\u2019s agenda is ratification of the High Seas Treaty. Adopted in 2023, the treaty would for the first time allow nations to establish marine protected areas in international waters, which cover nearly two-thirds of the ocean and are largely ungoverned.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the Wild West out there with countries just fishing anywhere without any sort of regulation, and that needs to change,\u201d said Mauro Randone, regional projects manager at the World Wildlife Fund\u2019s Mediterranean Marine Initiative. \u201cThe high seas belong to everyone and no one practically at the same time, and countries are finally committing to establish some rules.\u201d",
      "The ocean is critical in stabilizing Earth\u2019s climate and sustaining life. It generates 50% of the oxygen we breathe, absorbs around 30% of carbon dioxide emissions and captures more than 90% of the excess heat caused by those emissions. Without a healthy ocean, experts warn, climate goals will remain out of reach.",
      "The treaty will only come into force once 60 countries ratify it. As of Monday, just 32 countries had. Advocates hope UNOC can build enough momentum to cross the threshold, which would allow for the first official Oceans Conference of Parties.",
      "\u201cTwo-thirds of the ocean is areas beyond national jurisdiction \u2014 that\u2019s half our planet,\u201d said Minna Epps, director of global ocean policy the International Union for Conservation of Nature. \u201cWe cannot possibly protect 30% of the ocean if it doesn\u2019t include the high seas.\u201d",
      "South Korea, France and the European Union have championed the treaty, but most large ocean nations have yet to ratify it, including the rest of the G20. Thousands of attendees are expected in Nice \u2014 from delegates and heads of state to scientists and industry leaders. The United States has yet to confirm a formal delegation.",
      "Beyond new commitments, the conference highlights the growing gap between marine protection declarations and real-world conservation.",
      "France, the conference co-host, claims to have surpassed the 30% target for marine protection. But environmental groups say only 3% of French waters are fully protected from harmful activities like bottom trawling and industrial fishing.",
      "In 2024 alone, more than 100 bottom-trawling vessels were recorded spending over 17,000 hours fishing within France\u2019s six marine nature parks, according to ocean advocacy group Oceana.",
      "\u201cThe government declares these as protected areas, but this is a lie,\u201d said Enric Sala, founder of National Geographic Pristine Seas marine reserve project. \u201cMost of it is political box-ticking. It\u2019s all paper parks.\u201d",
      "That criticism is echoed across the continent. A new World Wildlife Fund report found that although more than 11% of Europe\u2019s marine area is designated for protection, just 2% of EU waters have management plans in place.",
      "Fabien Boileau, director of marine protected areas at France\u2019s Office for Biodiversity, acknowledged the presence of bottom trawling in French protected areas, but said it was part of a phased strategy.",
      "\u201cIn France, we made the choice to designate large marine protected areas with relatively low levels of regulation at first, betting that stronger protections would be developed over time through local governance,\u201d he said. \u201cToday, we\u2019re gradually increasing the number of zones with stricter protections within those areas.\u201d",
      "While many marine protected areas struggle with enforcement, others show what real protection can achieve. Off the southern coast of France, Port-Cros National Park is one of the oldest marine reserves in the Mediterranean. There, strict anchoring bans have allowed vast seagrass meadows to grow undisturbed. Massive groupers patrol rocky outcrops, brightly colored nudibranchs munch on algae, and schools of large corbs glide through the shallows, undisturbed by fishing lines.",
      "\u201cThanks to the protections that have been in place since 1963, we can observe species that are much larger than elsewhere in the Mediterranean and at a much higher density than in other areas,\" said Hubert Flavigny, manager of Mio Palmo dive center in Hyeres, France.",
      "Still, such examples remain exceptions.",
      "Advocates say industrial fishing lobbies continue to resist stricter protections, despite evidence that well-managed reserves boost long-term fisheries through the \u201cspillover effect,\u201d whereby marine life flourishes in nearby waters.",
      "\u201cProtection is not the problem \u2014 overfishing is the problem,\u201d said Sala. \u201cThe worst enemy of the fishing industry is themselves.\u201d",
      "Frustrated by government inaction, environmental groups have taken enforcement into their own hands. In May, Greenpeace dropped 15 limestone boulders into France\u2019s Golfe du Lion, aiming to physically block bottom trawling in a marine area that has long been designated for protection. The protected zone was established in 2008 to preserve deep-sea ecosystems, yet 12 trawlers continue to operate there, despite scientific warnings of ecological collapse, according to activist group MedReAct. The Golfe is now one of the most overfished areas in the Mediterranean.",
      "The conference will feature 10 panels on topics such as blue finance, sustainable fisheries and plastic pollution. Deep sea mining is expected to feature in broader discussions, while small island states are likely to use the platform to advocate for increased climate adaptation funding. The outcome of these discussions will form the basis of the Nice Ocean Action Plan \u2014 a declaration of voluntary commitments to be adopted by consensus and presented at the United Nations in New York this July.",
      "\"There cannot be a healthy planet without a healthy ocean,\" said Peter Thomson, U.N. special envoy for the ocean. \u201cIt\u2019s urgent business for us all.\u201d ___",

      "Generally, federal military forces are not allowed to carry out civilian law enforcement duties against U.S. citizens except in times of emergency.",
      "An 18th-century wartime law called the Insurrection Act is the main legal mechanism that a president can use to activate the military or National Guard during times of rebellion or unrest. But Trump didn't invoke the Insurrection Act on Saturday.",
      "Instead, he relied on a similar federal law that allows the president to federalize National Guard troops under certain circumstances.",
      "The National Guard is a hybrid entity that serves both state and federal interests. Often it operates under state command and control, using state funding. Sometimes National Guard troops will be assigned by their state to serve federal missions, remaining under state command but using federal funding.",
      "The law cited by Trump's proclamation places National Guard troops under federal command. The law says that can be done under three circumstances: When the U.S. is invaded or in danger of invasion; when there is a rebellion or danger of rebellion against the authority of the U.S. government, or when the President is unable to \u201cexecute the laws of the United States,\u201d with regular forces.",
      "But the law also says that orders for those purposes \u201cshall be issued through the governors of the States.\u201d It's not immediately clear if the president can activate National Guard troops without the order of that state's governor.",
      "Notably, Trump\u2019s proclamation says the National Guard troops will play a supporting role by protecting ICE officers as they enforce the law, rather than having the troops perform law enforcement work.",
      "Steve Vladeck, a professor at the Georgetown University Law Center who specializes in military justice and national security law, says that\u2019s because the National Guard troops can\u2019t legally engage in ordinary law enforcement activities unless Trump first invokes the Insurrection Act.",
      "Vladeck said the move raises the risk that the troops could end up using force while filling that \u201cprotection\u201d role. The move could also be a precursor to other, more aggressive troop deployments down the road, he wrote on his website.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s nothing these troops will be allowed to do that, for example, the ICE officers against whom these protests have been directed could not do themselves,\u201d Vladeck wrote.",
      "The Insurrection Act and related laws were used during the Civil Rights era to protect activists and students desegregating schools. President Dwight Eisenhower sent the 101st Airborne to Little Rock, Arkansas, to protect Black students integrating Central High School after that state\u2019s governor activated the National Guard to keep the students out.",
      "George H.W. Bush used the Insurrection Act to respond to riots in Los Angeles in 1992 after the acquittal of white police officers who were videotaped beating Black motorist Rodney King.",
      "National Guard troops have been deployed for a variety of emergencies, including the COVID pandemic, hurricanes and other natural disasters. But generally, those deployments are carried out with the agreements of the governors of the responding states.",
      "In 2020, Trump asked governors of several states to deploy their National Guard troops to Washington, D.C. to quell protests that arose after George Floyd was killed by Minneapolis police officers. Many of the governors agreed, sending troops to the federal district.",
      "At the time, Trump also threatened to invoke the Insurrection Act for protests following Floyd\u2019s death in Minneapolis \u2013 an intervention rarely seen in modern American history. But then-Defense Secretary Mark Esper pushed back, saying the law should be invoked \u201conly in the most urgent and dire of situations.\u201d",
      "Trump never did invoke the Insurrection Act during his first term.",
      "But while campaigning for his second term, he suggested that would change. Trump told an audience in Iowa in 2023 that he was prevented from using the military to suppress violence in cities and states during his first term, and said if the issue came up again in his next term, \u201cI\u2019m not waiting.\u201d",
      "Trump also promised to deploy the National Guard to help carry out his immigration enforcement goals, and his top adviser Stephen Miller explained how that would be carried out: Troops under sympathetic Republican governors would send troops to nearby states that refuse to participate, Miller said on \u201cThe Charlie Kirk Show,\u201d in 2023.",
      "After Trump announced he was federalizing the National Guard troops on Saturday, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said other measures could follow.",
      "Hegseth wrote on the social media platform X that active duty Marines at Camp Pendleton were on high alert and would also be mobilized \u201cif violence continues.\u201d",

      "South Dakota is on a path to invest $2 billion into its corrections facilities in the next decade as a result of its stringent crime laws",
      "SIOUX FALLS, S.D. -- Two years after approving a tough-on-crime sentencing law, South Dakota is scrambling to deal with the price tag for that legislation: Housing thousands of additional inmates could require up to $2 billion to build new prisons in the next decade.",
      "That\u2019s a lot of money for a state with one of the lowest populations in the U.S., but a consultant said it\u2019s needed to keep pace with an anticipated 34% surge of new inmates in the next decade as a result of South Dakota\u2019s tough criminal justice laws. And while officials are grumbling about the cost, they don't seem concerned with the laws that are driving the need even as national crime rates are dropping.",
      "\u201cCrime has been falling everywhere in the country, with historic drops in crime in the last year or two,\u201d said Bob Libal, senior campaign strategist at the criminal justice nonprofit The Sentencing Project. \u201cIt\u2019s a particularly unusual time to be investing $2 billion in prisons.\u201d",
      "Some Democratic-led states have worked to close prisons and enact changes to lower inmate populations, but that's a tough sell in Republican-majority states such as South Dakota that believe in a tough-on-crime approach, even if that leads to more inmates.",
      "For now, state lawmakers have set aside a $600 million fund to replace the overcrowded 144-year-old South Dakota State Penitentiary in Sioux Falls, making it one of the most expensive taxpayer-funded projects in South Dakota history.",
      "But South Dakota will likely need more prisons. Phoenix-based Arrington Watkins Architects, which the state hired as a consultant, has said South Dakota will need 3,300 additional beds in coming years, bringing the cost to $2 billion.",
      "Driving up costs is the need for facilities with different security levels to accommodate the inmate population.",
      "Concerns about South Dakota\u2019s prisons first arose four years ago, when the state was flush with COVID-19 relief funds. Lawmakers wanted to replace the penitentiary, but they couldn't agree on where to put the prison and how big it should be.",
      "A task force of state lawmakers assembled by Republican Gov. Larry Rhoden is expected to decide that in a plan for prison facilities this July. Many lawmakers have questioned the proposed cost, but few have called for criminal justice changes that would make such a large prison unnecessary.",
      "\u201cOne thing I\u2019m trying to do as the chairman of this task force is keep us very focused on our mission,\u201d said Lieutenant Gov. Tony Venhuizen. \u201cThere are people who want to talk about policies in the prisons or the administration or the criminal justice system more broadly, and that would be a much larger project than the fairly narrow scope that we have.\u201d",
      "South Dakota's incarceration rate of 370 per 100,000 people is an outlier in the Upper Midwest. Neighbors Minnesota and North Dakota have rates of under 250 per 100,000 people, according to the Sentencing Project, a criminal justice advocacy nonprofit.",
      "Nearly half of South Dakota's projected inmate population growth can be attributed to a law approved in 2023 that requires some violent offenders to serve the full-length of their sentences before parole, according to a report by Arrington Watkins.",
      "When South Dakota inmates are paroled, about 40% are ordered to return to prison, the majority of those due to technical violations such as failing a drug test or missing a meeting with a parole officer. Those returning inmates made up nearly half of prison admissions in 2024.",
      "Sioux Falls criminal justice attorney Ryan Kolbeck blamed the high number of parolees returning in part on the lack of services in prison for people with drug addictions.",
      "\u201cPeople are being sent to the penitentiary but there\u2019s no programs there for them. There\u2019s no way it\u2019s going to help them become better people,\u201d he said. \u201cEssentially we\u2019re going to put them out there and house them for a little bit, leave them on parole and expect them to do well.\u201d",
      "South Dakota also has the second-greatest disparity of Native Americans in its prisons. While Native Americans make up one-tenth of South Dakota\u2019s population, they make up 35% of those in state prisons, according to Prison Policy Initiative, a nonprofit public policy group.",
      "Though legislators in the state capital, Pierre, have been talking about prison overcrowding for years, they're reluctant to dial back on tough-on-crime laws. For example, it took repeated efforts over six years before South Dakota reduced a controlled substance ingestion law to a misdemeanor from a felony for the first offense, aligning with all other states.",
      "\u201cIt was a huge, Herculean task to get ingestion to be a misdemeanor,\u201d Kolbeck said.",
      "Former penitentiary warden Darin Young said the state needs to upgrade its prisons, but he also thinks it should spend up to $300 million on addiction and mental illness treatment.",
      "\u201cUntil we fix the reasons why people come to prison and address that issue, the numbers are not going to stop,\u201d he said.",
      "Without policy changes, the new prisons are sure to fill up, criminal justice experts agreed.",
      "\u201cWe might be good for a few years, now that we\u2019ve got more capacity, but in a couple years it\u2019ll be full again,\u201d Kolbeck said. \u201cUnder our policies, you\u2019re going to reach capacity again soon.\u201d",

      "This year's Boulder Jewish Festival is being reimagined to focus on community healing",
      "BOULDER, Colo. -- The group that was attacked last weekend in Boulder, Colorado, while calling for Hamas to release Israeli hostages will be a central focus of the Boulder Jewish Festival, which kicks off Sunday morning in the same location where the firebombing took place.",
      "Organizers of the festival, which is in its 30th year, said they have reimagined the cultural celebration to focus on community healing after a man who yelled \u201cFree Palestine\u201d threw Molotov cocktails at Run for Their Lives demonstrators, according to law enforcement officials.",
      "Authorities have said 15 people and a dog were victims of the attack. Not all were physically injured, and some are considered victims for the legal case because they were in the area and could potentially have been hurt.",
      "Run for Their Lives, a global grassroots initiative with 230 chapters, started in October 2023 after Hamas militants from the Gaza Strip stormed into Israel, killing 1,200 people and taking 250 others hostage.",
      "Sunday's festival at the downtown Pearl Street pedestrian mall will center the group's cause \u2014 raising awareness of the 55 people believed to still be in captivity in Gaza. The Boulder chapter walks at the mall every weekend for 18 minutes, the numerical value of the Hebrew word \u201cchai,\u201d which means \u201clife.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt is going to look very different this year. Run for Their Lives is going to be featured front and center,\u201d said Miri Kornfeld, a Run for Their Lives organizer in Denver. \u201cThe community is looking for a way to come together after an act of violence. People just want to be together, and they want to celebrate who they are.\u201d",
      "A group representing families of the Israeli hostages plans to send at least one family to join the Boulder chapter Sunday as it resumes its weekly walks during the festival, Kornfeld said. Art, food and music are also planned.",
      "In response to the attack, the Boulder Police Department and the FBI are coordinating to provide increased security at the festival, local synagogues and the Boulder Jewish Community Center. Festival attendees can expect drones, SWAT elements and plainclothes officers in the crowd to increase safety and make people feel at ease, police Chief Stephen Redfearn said.",
      "\u201cAny would-be attacker, anybody that might come there to cause harm, I want them to see that we have a lot of people there, and hopefully that dissuades anyone from doing anything nefarious,\" Redfearn said Thursday.",
      "The victims of the attack include eight women and seven men, ranging in age from 25 to 88. One is a Holocaust survivor.",
      "Mohamed Sabry Soliman, 45, was charged Thursday in state court with 118 counts, including attempted murder, assault, illegal use of explosives and animal cruelty. He has also been charged with a hate crime in federal court and is jailed on a $10 million cash bond.",
      "Soliman, an Egyptian national who federal authorities say was living in the U.S. illegally, told police he was driven by a desire \u201cto kill all Zionist people,\" a reference to the movement to establish and sustain a Jewish state in Israel. Authorities said he expressed no remorse about the attack.",
      "U.S. immigration officials took Soliman's wife and five children, who also are Egyptian, into custody Tuesday. They have not been charged in the attack.",
      "A federal judge on Wednesday granted a request to block the deportation of Soliman\u2019s wife and children.",
      "Colorado Gov. Jared Polis, who is Jewish, has deemed the attack antisemitic, meaning it targeted Jewish people because of their identity or beliefs.",
      "Organizers have not confirmed whether all the demonstrators last Sunday were Jewish. The group is open to Jewish and non-Jewish participants.",
      "The violence in downtown Boulder unfolded against the backdrop of the Israel-Hamas war, which continues to inflame global tensions and has contributed to a spike in antisemitism in the U.S. It also came at the start of the holiday of Shavuot, which commemorates God giving the Torah to the Jewish people at Mount Sinai in Egypt.",
      "\u201cIn the wake of the most violent antisemitic terrorist attack in Colorado history, we are reminded of the profound power of standing shoulder to shoulder,\u201d Mindy Miller of Stop Antisemitism Colorado said at a community vigil Wednesday night. \u201cLet today be the beginning of a new chapter in Colorado \u2014 one where Jews no longer have to stand alone.\u201d",

      "IRMO, S.C. -- Mohammad Sharafoddin, his wife and young son walked at times for 36 hours in a row over mountain passes as they left Afghanistan as refugees to end up less than a decade later talking about their journey on a plush love seat in the family's three-bedroom suburban American home.",
      "He and his wife dreamed of bringing her niece to the United States to share in that bounty. Maybe she could study to become a doctor and then decide her own path.",
      "But that door slams shut on Monday as America put in place a travel ban for people from Afghanistan and a dozen other countries.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s kind of shock for us when we hear about Afghanistan, especially right now for ladies who are affected more than others with the new government,\u201d Mohammad Sharafoddin said. \u201cWe didn't think about this travel ban.\u201d",
      "President Donald Trump signed the ban Wednesday. It is similar to one in place during his first administration but covers more countries. Along with Afghanistan, travel to the U.S. is banned from Myanmar, Chad, the Republic of Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen.",
      "Trump said visitors who overstay visas, like the man charged in an attack that injured dozens of demonstrators in Boulder, Colorado, earlier this month, are a danger to the country. The suspect in the attack is from Egypt, which isn't included in the ban.",
      "The countries chosen for the ban have deficient screening of their citizens, often refuse to take them back and have a high percentage of people who stay in the U.S. after their visas expire, Trump said.",
      "The ban makes exceptions for people from Afghanistan on Special Immigrant Visas who generally worked most closely with the U.S. government during the two-decade war there.",
      "Afghanistan was also one of the largest sources of resettled refugees, with about 14,000 arrivals in a 12-month period through September 2024. Trump suspended refugee resettlement on his first day in office.",
      "It is a path Sharafoddin took with his wife and son out of Afghanistan walking on those mountain roads in the dark then through Pakistan, Iran and into Turkey. He worked in a factory for years in Turkey, listening to YouTube videos on headphones to learn English before he was resettled in Irmo, South Carolina, a suburb of Columbia.",
      "His son is now 11, and he and his wife had a daughter in the U.S. who is now 3. There is a job at a jewelry maker that allows him to afford a two-story, three-bedroom house. Food was laid out on two tables Saturday for a celebration of the Muslim Eid al-Adha holiday.",
      "Sharafoddin's wife, Nuriya, said she is learning English and driving \u2014 two things she couldn't do in Afghanistan under Taliban rule.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m very happy to be here now, because my son is very good at school and my daughter also. I think after 18 years they are going to work, and my daughter is going to be able to go to college,\u201d she said.",
      "It is a life she wanted for her niece too. The couple show videos from their cellphones of her drawing and painting. When the Taliban returned to power in 2021, their niece could no longer study. So they started to plan to get her to the U.S. at least to further her education.",
      "Nuriya Sharafoddin doesn't know if her niece has heard the news from America yet. She hasn't had the heart to call and tell her.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not ready to call her. This is not good news. This is very sad news because she is worried and wants to come,\u201d Nuriya Sharafoddin said.",
      "While the couple spoke, Jim Ray came by. He has helped a number of refugee families settle in Columbia and helped the Sharafoddins navigate questions in their second language.",
      "Ray said Afghans in Columbia know the return of the Taliban changed how the U.S. deals with their native country.",

      "Six decades after the federal government ordered Concordia Parish to desegregate its schools, the district remains racially divided",
      "FERRIDAY, La. -- Even at a glance, the differences are obvious. The walls of Ferriday High School are old and worn, surrounded by barbed wire. Just a few miles away, Vidalia High School is clean and bright, with a new library and a crisp blue \u201cV\u201d painted on orange brick.",
      "Ferriday High is 90% Black. Vidalia High is 62% white.",
      "For Black families, the contrast between the schools suggests \u201cwe\u2019re not supposed to have the finer things,\u201d said Brian Davis, a father in Ferriday. \u201cIt\u2019s almost like our kids don\u2019t deserve it,\u201d he said.",
      "The schools are part of Concordia Parish, which was ordered to desegregate 60 years ago and remains under a court-ordered plan to this day. Yet there\u2019s growing momentum to release the district \u2014 and dozens of others \u2014 from decades-old orders that some call obsolete.",
      "In a remarkable reversal, the Justice Department said it plans to start unwinding court-ordered desegregation plans dating to the Civil Rights Movement. Officials started in April, when they lifted a 1960s order in Louisiana\u2019s Plaquemines Parish. Harmeet Dhillon, who leads the department\u2019s civil rights division, has said others will \u201cbite the dust.\u201d",
      "It comes amid pressure from Republican Gov. Jeff Landry and his attorney general, who have called for all the state\u2019s remaining orders to be lifted. They describe the orders as burdens on districts and relics of a time when Black students were still forbidden from some schools.",
      "The orders were always meant to be temporary \u2014 school systems can be released if they demonstrate they fully eradicated segregation. Decades later, that goal remains elusive, with stark racial imbalances persisting in many districts.",
      "Civil rights groups say the orders are important to keep as tools to address the legacy of forced segregation \u2014 including disparities in student discipline, academic programs and teacher hiring. They point to cases like Concordia, where the decades-old order was used to stop a charter school from favoring white students in admissions.",
      "\u201cConcordia is one where it's old, but a lot is happening there,\u201d said Deuel Ross, deputy director of litigation for the NAACP Legal Defense Fund. \u201cThat\u2019s true for a lot of these cases. They\u2019re not just sitting silently.\u201d",
      "Last year, before President Donald Trump took office, Concordia Parish rejected a Justice Department plan that would have ended its case if the district combined several majority white and majority Blac k elementary and middle schools.",
      "At a town hall meeting, Vidalia residents vigorously opposed the plan, saying it would disrupt students\u2019 lives and expose their children to drugs and violence. An official from the Louisiana attorney general\u2019s office spoke against the proposal and said the Trump administration likely would change course on older orders.",
      "Accepting the plan would have been a \u201cdeath sentence\u201d for the district, said Paul Nelson, a former Concordia superintendent. White families would have fled to private schools or other districts, said Nelson, who wants the court order removed.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s time to move on,\u201d said Nelson, who left the district in 2016. \u201cLet\u2019s start looking to build for the future, not looking back to what our grandparents may have gone through.\u201d",
      "At Ferriday High, athletic coach Derrick Davis supported combining schools in Ferriday and Vidalia. He said the district's disparities come into focus whenever his teams visit schools with newer sports facilities.",
      "\u201cIt seems to me, if we\u2019d all combine, we can all get what we need,\u201d he said.",
      "Others oppose merging schools if it\u2019s done solely for the sake of achieving racial balance. \u201cRedistricting and going to different places they\u2019re not used to ... it would be a culture shock to some people,\" said Ferriday\u2019s school resource officer, Marcus Martin, who, like Derrick Davis, is Black.",
      "The district\u2019s current superintendent and school board did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "Concordia is among more than 120 districts across the South that remain under desegregation orders from the 1960s and \u201970s, including about a dozen in Louisiana.",
      "Calling the orders historical relics is \u201cunequivocally false,\u201d said Shaheena Simons, who until April led the Justice Department section that oversees school desegregation cases.",
      "\u201cSegregation and inequality persist in our schools, and they persist in districts that are still under desegregation orders,\u201d she said.",
      "With court orders in place, families facing discrimination can reach out directly to the Justice Department or seek relief from the court. Otherwise, the only recourse is a lawsuit, which many families can\u2019t afford, Simons said.",
      "In Concordia, the order played into a battle over a charter school that opened in 2013 on the former campus of an all-white private school. To protect the area\u2019s progress on racial integration, a judge ordered Delta Charter School to build a student body that reflected the district\u2019s racial demographics. But in its first year, the school was just 15% Black.",
      "After a court challenge, Delta was ordered to give priority to Black students. Today, about 40% of its students are Black.",
      "Desegregation orders have been invoked recently in other cases around the state. One led to an order to address disproportionately high rates of discipline for Black students, and in another a predominantly Black elementary school was relocated from a site close to a chemical plant.",
      "The Trump administration was able to close the Plaquemines case with little resistance because the original plaintiffs were no longer involved \u2014 the Justice Department was litigating the case alone. Concordia and an unknown number of other districts are in the same situation, making them vulnerable to quick dismissals.",
      "Concordia\u2019s case dates to 1965, when the area was strictly segregated and home to a violent offshoot of the Ku Klux Klan. When Black families in Ferriday sued for access to all-white schools, the federal government intervened.",
      "As the district integrated its schools, white families fled Ferriday. The district's schools came to reflect the demographics of their surrounding areas. Ferriday is mostly Black and low-income, while Vidalia is mostly white and takes in tax revenue from a hydroelectric plant. A third town in the district, Monterey, has a high school that's 95% white.",
      "At the December town hall, Vidalia resident Ronnie Blackwell said the area \u201cfeels like a Mayberry, which is great,\u201d referring to the fictional Southern town from \u201cThe Andy Griffith Show.\u201d The federal government, he said, has \u201cprobably destroyed more communities and school systems than it ever helped.\u201d",
      "Under its court order, Concordia must allow students in majority Black schools to transfer to majority white schools. It also files reports on teacher demographics and student discipline.",
      "After failing to negotiate a resolution with the Justice Department, Concordia is scheduled to make its case that the judge should dismiss the order, according to court documents. Meanwhile, amid a wave of resignations in the federal government, all but two of the Justice Department lawyers assigned to the case have left.",
      "Without court supervision, Brian Davis sees little hope for improvement.",
      "\u201cA lot of parents over here in Ferriday, they\u2019re stuck here because here they don\u2019t have the resources to move their kids from A to B,\" he said. \u201cYou\u2019ll find schools like Ferriday \u2014 the term is, to me, slipping into darkness.\"",

      "Tens of thousands of people participated in parades and other festivities, in defiance of what activists say is an unprecedented assault on the LGBTQ+ community that challenges the rights many have fought for over the years.",
      "A rainbow flag the length of three football fields flowed through the streets, carried by 500 members of the Gay Men\u2019s Chorus of Washington, D.C., to kick off the parade.

      "\u201cPride means us looking out for each other no matter what,\u201d she declared to the crowd as the convertible rolled to a stop. \u201cWe know how to be there for each other.\u201d",
      "Many LGBTQ+ travelers have expressed concerns or decided to skip World Pride due to anxieties about safety, border policies and a hostile political climate that they say hearkens back to another time. But that did not keep international travelers and other participants away, with groups visible from Iran, Namibia, Kenya and Russia.",
      "Along the parade route, hundreds gathered outside the National City Christian Church as rainbow flags and balloons lined its steps and columns. A child with rainbow face paint blew bubbles at the base of the steps while Whitney Houston\u2019s \u201cI Wanna Dance with Somebody\u201d blared from loudspeakers.\u201d",

      "\u201cIt feels more important than ever,\u201d Kerver said while wearing a rainbow hat, sunglasses and a T-shirt. \u201cBut we also have to get involved in our local communities too.\u201c",
      "David Begler, a 58-year-old gay man from Philadelphia, expressed disappointment that many international travelers felt unsafe visiting D.C. for World Pride but said he appreciates its presence in the city during this political climate.",

So it\u2019s an amazing thing to be among allies, among people who love because we\u2019ve experienced so much hate on a daily basis.\u201d",

      "Convicted killer and recaptured prison escapee Grant Hardin, known as the \u201cDevil in the Ozarks,\u201d has been transferred to the Varner SuperMax prison southeast of Little Rock, Arkansas prison authorities announced Saturday.",
      "After a nearly two-week search in the rugged mountains of northern Arkansas, authorities recaptured Hardin on Friday 1.5 miles (2.4 kilometers) northwest of the prison from which he escaped. Hardin briefly attempted to run from officers when he saw them approach, but he was quickly tackled to the ground, said Rand Champion, a spokesperson for the Arkansas prison system.",
      "Authorities tried to track Hardin using drones, bloodhounds and a helicopter, but high water from heavy rains during the search raised the water level in creeks and streams around the prison. That likely limited his abilities \u2014 and also those of the searchers -- to move through the rugged terrain, Champion said.",
      "\u201cThe direction he went, specifically around Moccasin Creek, saw high water due to the abundance of rain the last few weeks, which more than likely limited his options to get around the area,\u201d Champion said. \u201cSearch teams had looked through this area before, but the high water previously limited their ability to fully investigate.\u201d",
      "Residents of the nearby town of Calico Rock, like Roger Simons, said they were surprised to learn that Hardin had stayed so close to the prison.",
      "\u201cNone of us really thought he was still in the area,\u201d said Simons, a local bartender. \u201cWe thought he was long gone \u2014 that's what I would have bet my money on.\"",
      "Hardin had been held at the Calico Rock prison since 2017 after pleading guilty to first-degree murder in a fatal shooting. He escaped by impersonating a corrections officer \u201cin dress and manner,\u201d according to a court document.",
      "A prison officer in one of the guard towers opened a secure gate, allowing him to walk out of the facility. Authorities say they are investigating why Hardin's identity was not checked before he was allowed to leave.",
      "Benton County Prosecutor Bryan Sexton, who oversaw Hardin\u2019s convictions for murder and rape, said he had been in close contact with law enforcement officials who were \u201cconsistent\u201d with their belief that Hardin remained in the northern Arkansas region.",
      "Hardin is a former police chief in the small town of Gateway near the Arkansas-Missouri border whose notoriety led to a TV documentary called \u201cDevil in the Ozarks.\u201d Sexton said his escape had significantly disrupted the lives of trial witnesses and Hardin's victims, whom he kept updated on the pursuit for the fugitive.",
      "\u201cEvery one of them to a person informed me that they had to make changes in their lives because they had had concerns for their safety,\u201d Sexton said.",
      "After Hardin's recapture, \u201cthey could get closure in their lives and secondly go back to their normal lives, which had been disrupted the whole time he was out,\u201d Sexton said.",
      "Cheryl Tillman, the sister of a man shot by Hardin in 2017, told The Associated Press that Hardin\u2019s capture was a \u201cbig sigh of relief\u201d for her whole family.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t have to walk around, turning around all the time, thinking somebody\u2019s on our back,\u201d Tillman said, emphasizing her appreciation for the officers who helped capture Hardin.",
      "Sexton said he was more assured now that Hardin was being sent to a more secure facility.",
      "The Varner Unit, established in 1987, has the capacity to house 1,714 inmates. It is the site where former President Bill Clinton\u2019s gubernatorial chief of staff, a death penalty opponent, faced charges for trying to smuggle a knife and tattoo needles into death row.",
      "Within Varner, a special \u201csupermax\u201d unit houses the most high-risk prisoners such as a man who fatally shot a soldier at a military recruiting station and death row inmates such as convicted child rapist and murderer Zachary Holly. Damien Wayne Echols of the West Memphis Three was also incarcerated there prior to his release.",
      "\u201cBy reputation, Varner is the most secure prison in the Arkansas system,\u201d Sexton said. \"I think that all things considering, putting him (Hardin) in the most secure facility we can is probably a wise thing to do.\"",

    "story": [
      "Nearly 1 in 5 positions across the Food and Drug Administration's human food inspection divisions are now vacant, multiple agency officials tell CBS News, in the wake of departures encouraged by the Trump administration's cost-cutting efforts and a government-wide hiring freeze that had stalled efforts to replenish their ranks.",
      "While the FDA has long struggled with hiring and retaining qualified investigators to inspect food producers and distributors, multiple federal health officials \u2014 who spoke on the condition of anonymity and were not authorized to speak to the press \u2014 say that the staffing gap has worsened due to early retirements and resignations.",
      "\"The FDA remains fully capable of fulfilling its public health mission to protect the safety of the American people. Under Commissioner Makary's leadership, the agency continues to meet its inspection obligations, ensuring that all facilities are reviewed within mandated timeframes,\" Emily Hilliard, a spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services, told CBS News.",
      "FDA Commissioner Dr. Marty Makary has claimed in interviews that no inspectors were laid off at the agency as a result of the sweeping restructuring ordered by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. that began in April, but has not acknowledged the retirements and resignations.",
      "And despite Makary's statements, multiple FDA officials said they are worried about worsening attrition in the agency's ranks of investigators.",
      "\"They're not going to admit our mission is at risk and we're missing timeframes, even though I've heard that's happening,\" a current FDA official told CBS News in a message.",
      "A separate current FDA official and one former official said that close to 20% of investigational positions are vacant across the agency's human foods inspectorate.",
      "\"Since 2017, our ability to fulfill its public health mission is increasingly constrained by reduced inspectional capacity. We continue to face significant obstacles in recruiting and retaining qualified investigators, particularly in the foods program, where nearly 90 investigative positions remain vacant,\" the agency said last month in response to a draft of a report by the HHS inspector general.",
      "The inspector general had concluded that the FDA would need to increase inspections by more than 3,000 each year, in order to meet its goals. Under requirements laid out by Congress, the FDA is required to inspect food facilities at specific intervals, benchmarks that government watchdogs have long faulted the agency for falling short of.",
      "\"For FDA to meet the inspection timeframes moving forward, it would need to inspect approximately 7,000 high-risk facilities each year. However, FDA inspected only about 58 percent of that amount,\" the inspector general's June 2025 report said.",
      "Around 40% of investigator positions are vacant for the group of investigators tasked with inspecting \"critical foods\" like infant formula plants, a current official said.",
      "\"Critical foods has had difficulty with staffing because every inspection is high profile and the team is traveling more often than not. It isn't sustainable for everyone,\" a former FDA official said.",
      "The job of an FDA investigator has gotten harder in recent months, as the Trump administration imposed additional hurdles to make small purchases necessary for their work, ranging from buying everyday supplies to shipping samples, officials said.",
      "\"The reality is that the extra steps in budget approval processes have caused inspections to be delayed, and investigators have had to take on administrative tasks that eat into their time being productive. Everything was taking longer,\" the former FDA official said.",
      "Many administrative staff and laboratory scientists supporting the FDA's food inspectors were also eliminated through layoffs, resulting in backlogs of testing and reimbursements. Some have since been reinstated by the agency.",
      "One current and one former FDA official said the agency also had many investigators that were in the process of being hired months ago, before attempts to fill the slots were blocked by an order signed by President Trump that now extends through July 15.",
      "Multiple officials said Friday morning they were hopeful that the Trump administration might grant an exemption to the hiring freeze after weeks of lobbying by officials within the agency.",
      "On Friday afternoon, after HHS responded to a CBS News request for comment about this story, the FDA published its first new hiring announcement for food investigators in months, among a handful of new job postings.",

      "Pesticides are a known contributor to asthma and are commonly used where Bejarano lives in California's Imperial Valley, a landlocked region that straddles two counties on the U.S.-Mexico border and is one of the main producers of the nation's winter crops. It also has some of the worst air pollution in the nation and one of the highest rates of childhood asthma emergency room visits in the state, according to data collected by the California Department of Public Health.",
      "Bejarano has since learned to manage her now-19-year-old son's asthma and works at Comite Civico del Valle, a local rights organization focused on environmental justice in the Imperial Valley. The organization trains health care workers to educate patients on proper asthma management, enabling them to avoid hospitalization and eliminate triggers at home. The course is so popular that there's a waiting list, Bejarano said.",
      "But the group's Asthma Management Academy program and similar initiatives nationwide face extinction with the Trump administration's mass layoffs, grant cancellations, and proposed budget cuts at the Department of Health and Human Services and the Environmental Protection Agency. Asthma experts fear the cumulative impact of the reductions could result in more ER visits and deaths, particularly for children and people in low-income communities \u2014 populations disproportionately vulnerable to the disease.",
      "\"Asthma is a preventive condition,\" Bejarano said. \"No one should die of asthma.\"",
      "Asthma can block airways, making it hard to breathe, and in severe cases can cause death if not treated quickly. Nearly 28 million people in the U.S. have asthma, and about 10 people still die every day from the disease, according to the Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America.",
      "In May, the White House released a budget proposal that would permanently shutter\u00a0the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Asthma Control Program, which was already gutted by federal health department layoffs in April. It's unclear whether Congress will approve the closure.",
      "Last year, the program allotted $33.5 million to state-administered initiatives in 27 states, Puerto Rico, and Washington, D.C., to help communities with asthma education. The funding is distributed in four-year grant cycles, during which the programs receive up to $725,000 each annually.",
      "Comite Civico del Valle's academy in Southern California, a clinician workshop in Houston, and asthma medical management training in Allentown, Pennsylvania \u2014 ranked the most challenging U.S. city to live in with asthma \u2014 are among the programs largely surviving on these grants. The first year of the current grant cycle ends Aug. 31, and it's unknown whether funding will continue beyond then.",
      "Data suggests that the CDC's National Asthma Control Program has had a significant impact. The agency's own research has shown that the program saves $71 in health care costs for every $1 invested. And the asthma death rate decreased 44% between the 1999 launch of the program and 2021, according to the American Lung Association.",
      "\"Losing support from the CDC will have devastating impacts on asthma programs in states and communities across the country, programs that we know are improving the lives of millions of people with asthma,\" said Anne Kelsey Lamb, director of the Public Health Institute's Regional Asthma Management and Prevention program. \"And the thing is that we know a lot about what works to help people keep their asthma well controlled, and that's why it's so devastating.\"",
      "The Trump administration cited cost savings and efficiency in its April announcement of the cuts to HHS. Requests for comment from the White House and HHS's CDC about cuts to federal asthma and related programs were not answered.",
      "The information wars",
      "Fresno, in the heart of California's Central Valley, is one of the country's top 20 \"asthma capitals,\" with high rates of asthma and related emergencies and deaths. It's home to programs that receive funding through the National Asthma Control Program. Health care professionals there also rely on another aspect of the program that is under threat if it's shuttered: countrywide data.",
      "The federal asthma program collects information on asthma rates and offers a tool to study prevalence and rates of death from the disease, see what populations are most affected, and assess state and local trends. Asthma educators and health care providers worry that the loss of these numbers could be the biggest impact of the cuts, because it would mean a dearth of information crucial to forming educated recommendations and treatment plans.",
      "\"How do we justify the services we provide if the data isn't there?\" said Graciela Anaya, director of community health at the Central California Asthma Collaborative in Fresno.",
      "Mitchell Grayson, chair of the Asthma and Allergy Foundation's Medical Scientific Council, is similarly concerned.",
      "\"My fear is we're going to live in a world that is frozen in Jan. 19, 2025, as far as data, because that was the last time you know that this information was safely collected,\" he said.",
      "Grayson, an allergist who practices in Columbus, Ohio, said he also worries government websites will delete important recommendations that asthma sufferers avoid heavy air pollution, get annual flu shots, and get COVID-19 vaccines.",
      "Disproportionate risk",
      "Asthma disproportionately affects communities of color because of \"historic structural issues,\" said Lynda Mitchell, CEO of the Asthma and Allergy Network, citing a higher likelihood of living in public housing or near highways and other pollution sources.",
      "She and other experts in the field said cuts to diversity initiatives across federal agencies, combined with the rollback of environmental protections, will have an outsize impact on these at-risk populations.",
      "In December, the Biden administration awarded nearly $1.6 billion through the EPA's Community Change Grants program to help disadvantaged communities address pollution and climate threats. The Trump administration moved to cut this funding in March. The grant freezes, which have been temporarily blocked by the courts, are part of a broader effort by the Trump EPA to eliminate aid to environmental justice programs across the agency.",
      "In 2023 and 2024, the National Institutes of Health's Climate Change and Health Initiative received $40 million for research, including on the link between asthma and climate change. The Trump administration has moved to cut that money. And a March memo essentially halted all NIH grants focused on diversity, equity, and inclusion, or DEI \u2014 funds many of the asthma programs serving low-income communities rely on to operate.",
      "On top of those cuts, environmental advocates like Isabel Gonz\u00e1lez Whitaker of Memphis, Tennessee, worry that the proposed reversals of environmental regulations will further harm the health of communities like hers that are already reeling from the effects of climate change. Shelby County, home to Memphis, recently received an F on the American Lung Association's annual report card for having so many high ozone days. Gonz\u00e1lez Whitaker is director of EcoMadres, a program within the national organization Moms for Clean Air that advocates for better environmental conditions for Latino communities.",
      "\"Urgent asthma needs in communities are getting defunded at a time when I just see things getting worse in terms of deregulation,\" said Gonz\u00e1lez Whitaker, who took her 12-year-old son to the hospital because of breathing issues for the first time this year. \"We're being assaulted by this data and science, which is clearly stating that we need to be doing better around preserving the regulations.\"",
      "Back in California's Imperial Valley \u2014 where the majority-Hispanic, working-class population surrounds California's largest lake, the Salton Sea \u2014 is an area called Bombay Beach. Bejarano calls it the \"forgotten community.\" Homes there lack clean running water, because of naturally occurring arsenic in the groundwater, and residents frequently experience a smell like rotten eggs blowing off the drying lakebed, exposing decades of pesticide-tinged dirt.",
      "In 2022, a 12-year-old girl died in Bombay Beach after an asthma attack. Bejarano said she later learned that the girl's school had recommended that she take part in Comite Civico del Valle's at-home asthma education program. She said the girl was on the waiting list when she died.",
      "\"It hit home. Her death showed the personal need we have here in Imperial County,\" Bejarano said. \"Deaths are preventable. Asthma is reversible. If you have asthma, you should be able to live a healthy life.\"",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/norovirus-surge-early-cdc-tracking-new-strain/",
    "published": "Wed, 04 Jun 2025 11:00:43 -0400",
    "summary": "The norovirus strain GII.17 may have disrupted the seasonal pattern of outbreaks.",
    "story": [
      "After years of largely predictable norovirus waves, the emergence of a new strain might have disrupted the seasonal pattern of outbreaks from this notorious stomach bug, suggests a new report by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "In previous years, the U.S. usually saw norovirus outbreaks increase around December. That marked the start of the season for the virus. But last year's season started in October, as a new norovirus strain called GII.17 drove a record wave of outbreaks.",
      "\"Continued surveillance is needed to determine if this genotype remains the dominant genotype, as well as whether the norovirus season continues to start earlier than previous years,\" wrote two of the CDC's top norovirus researchers, in an article published this month by the agency's Emerging Infectious Diseases journal.",
      "Outbreaks have since slowed to usual levels. But with GII.17 now identified in more than 3 in 4 outbreaks in the U.S., its displacement of the GII.4 strain that had previously been dominant is raising questions about whether norovirus season could arrive early again.",
      "\"GII.4 viruses are the main driver for norovirus seasonality. With the decrease of GII.4 outbreaks since 2024, whether GII.17 viruses will continue to cause an earlier onset of the norovirus season cannot yet be determined,\" the CDC researchers wrote.",
      "Several other countries also saw unusually large or shifted waves of norovirus this past year, after GII.17 surged to dominance.",
      "In England, norovirus reports reached levels more than double recent seasons. GII.17 was the most frequently reported genotype of norovirus through April, far above GII.4.",
      "In Japan, where GII.17 previously drove a wave of infections a decade ago, local health authorities in Tokyo reported a steep wave of infectious gastroenteritis \u2014 most from norovirus \u2014 that peaked weeks later than previous seasons and remains above recent years.",
      "Miranda de Graaf, a scientist at Erasmus University Medical Center in the Netherlands coordinating the global NoroNet network of norovirus researchers, said the Dutch nation did not see an earlier start to its norovirus season. But the country did see higher numbers of norovirus outbreaks, including a few large outbreaks in between when the usual seasonal surges occurred.",
      "GII.4 was still being detected around the world, meaning it was possible that GII.17's dominance could be short-lived, de Graaf said. Researchers had previously wondered if GII.17 could permanently take over, only to see GII.4 cases continue to remain dominant.",
      "\"GII.17 only replaced GII.4 last year, and there has not been another seasonal peak after that. Therefore it is not clear if these shifts will last, or if GII.17 will be the predominant strain next winter season,\" de Graaf said in an email.",
      "A CDC spokesperson said the agency is monitoring norovirus outbreaks through its CaliciNet laboratory\u00a0database\u00a0and pointed to a surge of GII.17 strains in Asia and Europe in 2014 that was followed by no reports of a change to seasonality.",
      "They also cautioned that there was no clear evidence to prove that GII.17's emergence was the cause of a change to the norovirus season last year.",
      "\"There are currently insufficient historic data to predict whether norovirus GII.17 will remain the dominant genotype and lead to an earlier onset of the norovirus season later this year,\" the spokesperson said in an email.",
      "Benjamin Lopman, an epidemiology professor at Emory University who previously worked for the CDC's viral diseases division, said shifts in norovirus strains happen \"when new variants find ways around the immunity that people have built up\" to previous strains. He said that new strains usually trigger more frequent outbreaks earlier in the season.",
      "\"I expect we'll see outbreak patterns return to more typical levels and seasonal patterns in the coming years, though it's always challenging to predict how these viruses will behave,\" Lopman said in an email.",

      "What new features is Apple expected to roll out?",
      "Although analysts don't expect any blockbuster reveals from Apple this week, they are looking for refinements in Apple Intelligence, the AI features offered on the iPhone, iPad and other devices. Apple announced new AI integrations for Siri at last year's conference, but the full suite of upgrades for the voice assistant have yet to take effect.",
      "\"It's just taking a bit longer than we thought,\" Apple CEO Tim Cook said in a call with Wall Street analysts. \"But we are making progress, and we're extremely excited to get the more personal Siri features out there.\"",
      "In a research note, Wedbush tech analyst Dan Ives noted that the Apple Intelligence rollout has been slower than expected, but also estimates that over the next few years, 25% of the world population will access AI through an Apple-powered device. At this week's event, Apple is likely to provide updates on Siri's integration with two major AI platforms, Google's Gemini and OpenAI's ChatGPT, according to Ives.",
      "Apple is also expected announce a new \u2014 and more straightforward \u2014 nomenclature for its operating system. For example, rather than iOS 19, the operating system introduced in 2025 would be called iOS 26 to align with the coming year. The latest iOS is slated to be released as a free update in September.",
      "\"While many on [Wall] Street are heading into WWDC as underwhelming given the slower-than-expected rollout of Apple Intelligence, we disagree with this bearish narrative and strongly believe this will be the start of AI monetization period of the Apple ecosystem as the company will continue to lay the foundation through its new operating system updates across Mac, iOS, iPad and others with its '26\" update,'\" Ives said.",

      "In a\u00a0statement\u00a0on Monday, the company said current Warner Bros. Discovery CEO David Zaslav will serve as president and CEO of Streaming & Studios, while Gunnar Wiedenfels, chief financial officer of Warner Bros. Discovery, will lead the cable division, called Global Networks.",
      "The split, which the company said is expected to be completed by mid-2026, effectively unravels much of the merger that created Warner Bros. Discovery in 2022, when WarnerMedia combined with Discovery. Warner Bros. Discovery's cable networks, like many of its rivals, have lost viewers as consumers shifted to streaming services such as Netflix, causing its stock to slump more than 60% since the merger closed more than three years ago.",
      "Breaking the company into two new media businesses will allow each company to \"pursue important investment opportunities and drive shareholder value,\" Wiedenfels said in the statement.",
      "As part of its announcement, Warner Bros. Discovery said it would focus on scaling up HBO Max, which is now in 77 markets. The company in May said its streaming business \u2014 which includes HBO Max \u2014 is on track to add 150 million subscribers by the end of 2026.",
      "While Warner Bros. Discovery's streaming business has performed well, Adam Crisafulli of investment advisory firm Vital Knowledge said in a note to clients that its studio business is struggling. Revenue at that unit fell 18% in the first quarter compared to the same period last year.",
      "Falling revenue",
      "The company's overall first-quarter revenue tumbled 9% to $9 billion compared with the year-earlier period, according to its most recent earnings report.",
      "Last week at their annual meeting, shareholders rejected David Zaslav's $51.9 million pay package, according to Business Insider.\u00a0 A\u00a0study by research firm Equilar released in May found the median pay for CEOs in 2024 was $25.6 million, up 9.5% from 2023.",
      "\"The issue with the success of this split is the same one plaguing other media companies (including the separation underway at Comcast and the one considered but ultimately aborted at Disney) \u2013 the legacy networks businesses have poor top line growth prospects but relatively healthy profitability/cash flow, which means they generate important liquidity but are likely to garner middling valuations as standalone entities,\" Crisafulli said.",
      "New York City-based Warner Bros. did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Shares of the company were up 10.7% in early trading. The company has a market value of $24.3 billion.",
      "The new plan to separate the businesses comes after Warner Bros. announced a structural\u00a0reorganization\u00a0in December.",
      "Legacy media companies have struggled to maintain their foothold in recent years as viewers shift to alternative platforms for news and entertainment. The profit model for these outlets has also proven difficult to sustain as once-steady advertising revenue buckles, leading many companies to consolidate or restructure.",
      "Comcast in November announced plans to spin off some of its cable networks into a new publicly traded company. Dubbed Versant, the new entity will be comprised of USA Network, CNBC, MSNBC, Oxygen, E!, SYFY and Golf Channel.",
      "Elsewhere in the media landscape, Paramount Global, which owns CBS, MTV and Nickelodeon, is going through the merger process. Skydance Media, an entertainment business launched by David Ellison, son of Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison, agreed to merge with Paramount Global in July 2024 in an $8 billion deal.",

    "summary": "White House National Economic Council director Kevin Hassett signaled the administration would be open to Medicare cuts if senators uncover fraud or abuse as they look at the bill.",
    "story": [
      "White House National Economic Council director Kevin Hassett said Sunday the Trump administration is not targeting Medicare in its sweeping budget proposal, but signaled the administration would be open to changes if senators uncover fraud or abuse as they look at the bill.",
      "\"If somebody finds waste, fraud and abuse in Medicare, then of course we would look at it,\" Hassett said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\" \"But there have been a lot of false stories about Medicare being on the table, and it's totally not on the table.\"",
      "Senate Republicans this week are working on the House-passed budget bill, dubbed the \"One Big Beautiful Bill\" by President Trump, which includes deep tax cuts, border security measures, and changes to Medicaid and food assistance programs.",
      "Hassett on Sunday pushed back against the idea that Republicans are targeting Medicare for cuts.",
      "\"That story that got out last week was covered as our intent to go after Medicare,\" Hassett said bluntly. \"And it was just a big fake news story.\"",
      "Asked whether the administration would revisit the Medicare provision if the Senate identifies abuse, Hassett said they would. \"I've seen a massive amount of waste, fraud and abuse in Medicaid, and I've not been briefed on Medicare waste, fraud and abuse. But if they find something then, of course, we would look at it,\" he said.",
      "The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated earlier this week that the bill will add\u00a0 $2.4 trillion to the national debt over the next decade. Sen. Thom Tillis told Charlotte's WCNC on Thursday that he supports legislation that would address waste in the Medicare Advantage Program. This addition, he said, would not touch beneficiaries but would focus on \"eliminating waste, fraud, and abuse of the Medicare Advantage program, including costly government overpayments to insurance companies.\"",
      "To pay for some of Mr. Trump's tax reforms, such as extending his 2017 tax cuts and eliminating tax on tips, there are cuts to several programs. Republicans have insisted they are not cutting Medicaid, and reductions in the low-income entitlement program have become one of the most charged parts of the bill. In a closed-door session with members of the Republican conference days before the bill's passage, sources in the room told CBS News Mr. Trump said, \"Don't f*** around with Medicaid.\"",
      "House Republicans passed the bill late last month on a 215\u2013214 vote, sending it to the Senate where GOP leaders are weighing revisions to secure enough votes under budget reconciliation rules.",
      "\"What we want to see done now is we want the Senate to pass the bill, and then we want the House and Senate to work out their differences,\" Hassett said. \"So right now, the Senate has to get the votes they need to pass the bill, and we're supporting them in that process.\"",
      "Some Republican senators, including Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, and Josh Hawley of Missouri, have voiced concerns about Medicaid provisions in the bill, particularly new monthly premium requirements for low-income recipients. Their opposition highlights ongoing uncertainty as Senate GOP leaders work to secure enough votes. The bill can't afford to lose more than four votes in the Senate, granted that all Democrats vote against it.",
      "Hawley has called possible Medicaid cuts \"both morally wrong and politically suicidal.\"",
      "When asked about Hawley's concerns, Hassett said, \"I'd have to go see what he has and talk to him about it. And I also would want to talk to the president about the specific matter. So I can't speak to that one.\"",
      "The administration has repeatedly argued that failure to pass the legislation could hurt the broader economy.",
      "\"If we don't pass this bill, then we lose 6 to 7 million jobs and 4% GDP,\" Hassett said Sunday. \"If we create the jobs that we have in the bill, then we're going to create a heck of a lot more insurance than what we're talking about in waste, fraud and abuse.\"",
      "Senate Republicans are expected to release their version of the bill in the coming days. If there are significant changes, it will then have to go back to the House for final passage before landing on Mr. Trump's desk.",

    "summary": "Many creators on social media have a hard time making money from their work. Today, 12 years after the introduction of Patreon, the company says it's a source of regular income for more than 300,000 artists, musicians, podcasters and other creators.",
    "story": [
      "In 2013, musician Jack Conte made a music video called \"Pedals.\" He spent seven weeks and $10,000 building the set: \"I remember the blood, sweat and tears, the months of pain, and hours and hours, and days and days of creation,\" he laughed.",
      "The video quickly racked up a million views on YouTube.",
      "And for that success, YouTube paid him \u2026 $166. \"I felt undervalued, I felt resentful,\" Conte said. \"I started to feel like, 'I can't keep doing this.' I've told this story 10,000 times \u2013 I still get emotional, like, when I think about this. And I sat down at my kitchen table and I sketched out this idea for a better system, a better way for creators to make money and build businesses.\"",
      "He called that better way Patreon.com. It lets creators (like artists, musicians, podcasters, and video makers) get funding directly from their fans on the Internet. Conte said, \"Within about two weeks of launching, I was making six figures as a creative person.\"",
      "Here's how it works: Your biggest fans can pay you, for example, $5 or $10 a month. In exchange, you're supposed to offer them exclusive goodies, like bonus episodes, early access to new episodes, outtakes, or live interactions with you. \"It's work; it's not free money,\" Conte said. \"But you know, because it's such an incredible amount of income, it's worth it for most creators who try it.\"",
      "Caro Ar\u00e9valo creates intricate nature paintings, and also posts videos on YouTube and Instagram. Like most internet creators, she pieces together an income from various sources. \"I have my own online shop, where I sell my originals,\" Ar\u00e9valo said. \"I also have a Patreon, I have a YouTube channel. I do partner up with some brands, do commissioned work.\"",
      "During the Renaissance, Michelangelo may have counted on the wealthy Medici family for support. These days, Ar\u00e9valo has her Patreon patrons, who bring her about $700 a month. The top-paying fans get to chat with her on a monthly Zoom call.",
      "One of Ar\u00e9valo's subscribers, Alyssa Carroll, said, \"I like the fact that with just a small monthly amount I can, in a way, help support somebody else follow their dreams.\" Patron Alyssa Carroll said, \"You get to communicate with other like-minded artists. And you're able to, you know, share what you're doing.\"",
      "Ar\u00e9valo said, \"I get a lot out of Patreon, not only from the income that I'm making monthly, but also because I get to know people and they share their stories with me. And they are also inspiring me. So, I feel it's this, like, symbiotic relationship.\"",
      "Patrick Hinds and Gillian Pensavalle make the popular comedy podcast \"True Crime Obsessed,\" in which they riff about crime documentaries. Asked how a podcaster makes a living, Hinds laughed: \"Well, normally they don't! And that's really true.\"",
      "They launched their show in 2017 in the living room of Hinds' apartment. Today, they can be full-time podcasters, thanks to Patreon. They have a dedicated podcast studio and five full-time employees. They've produced more than 800 podcast episodes about our fascination with criminals.",
      "\"I'm a podcaster \u2013 it's still very liberating and weird to be able to say out loud,\" said Pensavalle. \"Still doesn't make a whole lotta sense, but here we are!\"",
      "\"But we always say, 'Put us out of work! Stop killing people!'\" Hinds laughed. \"Look, if I have to go back to bartending and that means no one gets murdered next year, I'll do it!\"",
      "Today, 12 years after Patreon's founding, the company says that it's a source of regular income for more than 300,000 creators.",
      "TV and movie star Alan Alda has a podcast, too, called \"Clear and Vivid\" \u2013 and even he uses Patreon. \"It's probably opened the door to a lot of people who wouldn't be able to devote themselves as much to their art as they can this way, where they can be in direct touch with the people who support them,\" he said.",
      "The proceeds fund his nonprofit, the Alan Alda Center for Communicating Science. The $45-a-month members get to join him each month for a video call. \"We're talking to people in Australia and England, Germany,\" Alda said. \"Sometimes they stay up 'til the middle of the night so they can talk to us at our time!\"",
      "I said, \"Who wouldn't stay up 'til the middle of the night to talk to you?\"",
      "\"I'm not sure I would!\" Alda laughed.",
      "So, what's the catch? Patreon collects 5% to 12% of all the fans' contributions. The company has occasionally stirred controversy by shutting down the Patreon pages of purveyors of porn, hate, and misinformation.",
      "Patreon has competitors now, too, like Substack, Ko-fi, and Buy Me a Coffee.",
      "And co-founder Jack Conte points out that Patreon doesn't work unless you already have a following online. \"Patreon helps you build a business. It works great for creators who are starting to find traction, have a couple thousand fans,\" he said.",
      "I said, \"We've all heard of the starving artist.\"",
      "\"I hate that term! I hate the term 'starving artist'!\" Conte laughed. \"If Patreon is successful, no one will use that term again. It will be gone from this planet. It will be a thing of the past. That's what I want.\"",

      "President Trump's tariff agenda has upended\u00a0supply chains for a range of businesses, and has forced many companies to raise prices on consumers in order to protect their margins. The aviation industry has also warned that the levies will affect its business.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/2025-pride-celebrations-corporate-sponsor-cancellations/",
    "published": "Fri, 06 Jun 2025 05:00:00 -0400",
    "summary": "The organizers of prominent Pride celebrations saw huge sponsorship drop-offs this year, a pattern seen as a response to the Trump administration.",
    "story": [
      "The architects of Pride celebrations across the United States met six-figure challenges this year, owing to a corporate exodus in the spring that diminished their sponsorship funds, which they said would jeopardize future programming. Organizers are contending with serious budget shortfalls as Pride Month begins, and several reported 20% to 30% less corporate support than in past years.",
      "The show will go on this summer, they said, but what happens next is less certain.",
      "\"We're going to make it to the event,\" said Suzanne Ford, the executive director of San Francisco Pride, who told CBS News five corporate sponsors cut ties with the organization over the course of one overwhelming week in March and several others reduced their funding. \"The real question now is, what kind of shape are we going to be in on the other side of Pride? Are we going to be able to keep the doors open?\"",
      "Corporate partners that backed out of San Francisco Pride this year were historically among its largest and most reliable donors, including Nissan Comcast/Xfinity and Bud Light's parent company, Anheuser-Busch. Along with Target, Bud Light has faced public backlash and boycotts over its Pride advertising in recent years.",
      "\"That hurt us greatly,\" Ford said of losing Anheuser-Busch, previously \"one of the very largest\" sponsors of San Francisco Pride. \"Comcast and Nissan have been significant and have been longtime partners. They've been with us for a long time, so it was money that we've counted on.\"",
      "Their retreats meant San Francisco Pride was operating at a loss of about $300,000, which Ford hopes will shrink to about $200,000 once increased donations are factored in from other sponsors, who raised their pledges to narrow the gaps left by the bigger brands. Two large corporate partners, Benefit Cosmetics and La Crema, initially dropped their sponsorship contracts but have since returned as partners, Ford said.",
      "Several brands that stepped back from Pride partnerships in San Francisco have done the same in other cities. Anheuser-Busch, known for decades as a supporter of the LGBTQ community, also declined to sponsor the 2025 Pride Festival in its hometown of St. Louis,\u00a0according to that event's organizers. The company had been one of their leading sponsors for the last 30 years, the organizers said.",
      "Pride Month was originally conceived as a way to commemorate the 1969 Stonewall riots, which are credited with kick-starting the modern gay rights movement, and it has evolved since then into a multifaceted celebration of the LGBTQ community. Local Pride plans typically involve multiday event rosters with at least one march, parade or festival, which are intermittently known to draw a million or more attendees.",
      "Celebrations around Pride grew tremendously over the last decade or so, organizers say, in large part because of an influx of corporate sponsorships cropping up after the U.S. legalized marriage equality in 2015. The upward trend in brand support was so steep for a period of time that some sponsors were\u00a0accused of exploiting LGBTQ issues\u00a0for the purpose of turning a profit.",
      "That trend looked very different this year, as corporate sponsors around the country either withdrew their support for Pride festivities or significantly scaled it back. Many attributed their decisions to financial strain or internal transitions, according to statements from several companies and organizers who recalled their conversations to CBS News.",
      "\"Nissan is currently reviewing all marketing and sales spending \u2014 including select consumer auto shows, sports properties and other entertainment activations \u2014 to maximize both efficiency and breakthrough effectiveness,\" a Nissan spokesperson said of the brand breaking partnerships with Pride organizers in San Francisco as well as New York City.",
      "But organizers and supporters see a pattern in the sponsorship cancellations, which some consider implicit byproducts of the Trump administration's\u00a0anti-DEI policies and ongoing\u00a0attacks on transgender Americans. Ron de Harte, the co-president of the Board of Directors at USA Prides, a national network of Pride organizations, said the decline in national brand sponsorships for Pride events is widespread this year.",
      "\"This is happening with festival and event sponsorships across the board,\" said de Harte in a statement. \"Of course, bad economic times are coupled with the current administration's unfriendly actions toward the LGBTQ communities, so some markets have sponsors who have moved on.\"",
      "As the Capital Pride Alliance organized WorldPride this year in Washington, D.C., it grappled with a litany of complications leading up to this weekend's international gathering. After President Trump took over the Kennedy Center, multiple WorldPride events were either canceled or relocated under new leadership. In addition, the consulting firm Booz Allen Hamilton, a major federal contractor, backed out of its 2025 WorldPride contract in a move that critics thought bent to government pressure.",
      "A spokesperson for Capital Pride Alliance said Booz Allen was the only WorldPride sponsor that canceled a finalized contract, but others dropped out in various stages of the sponsorship process, including Comcast/Xfinity, Deloitte and Visa. The spokesperson said some brands became \"silent partners,\" which means they donate in the background but avoid the publicity that can come with outright sponsorship.",
      "Matt \u015een\u0131z-Cheng, the director of corporate sponsorships at Heritage of Pride, the nonprofit that produces New York City Pride events, told CBS News that its corporate partners gave various explanations for decreasing or eliminating support. Economic weariness was among them, he said, along with fear of retaliation.",
      "\"One of the big ones is the tariffs and economy. A lot of budgets have gotten slashed from a DEI and marketing perspective,\" he said. \"But then the other one is fear of backlash from the federal government.\"",
      "Heritage of Pride lost roughly one-quarter of its sponsorship dollars, or about $750,000, in the last few months. Large companies like Deutsche Bank ramped up their earlier donations to organizations because of the shortfall, and a poll of about 100 individual donors recently gave $10,000 or so, \u015een\u0131z-Cheng said. He hoped New York City Pride fundraisers would bring them closer to zero losses.",
      "\"In addition to reviewing our budget lines to make sure we can afford to put on Pride the way that it typically is put on, our other concern is our year-round programming,\" he said.",
      "More immediately, a 25% budget gap would likely require Heritage of Pride to cut their only two grant programs, both of which support at-risk communities, \u015een\u0131z-Cheng added.",
      "Like San Francisco, St. Louis and WorldPride in D.C., New York City Pride also lost large sponsors. Nissan and PepsiCo both pulled support from Heritage of Pride after previously being top donors, according to public partnership information released last year and Kevin Kilbride, the media and marketing manager at the nonprofit. Other sponsors have reduced their funding but are still planning to march in the upcoming Manhattan parade, Kilbride said.",
      "Target has remained a silent partner of New York City Pride. Kilbride said Target continues to be \"a valued partner\" and its sponsorship this year was \"at a level consistent with years' past.\"",
      "\"We are absolutely dedicated to fostering inclusivity for everyone \u2014 our team members, our guests, our supply partners, and the more than 2,000 communities we're proud to serve,\" a Target spokesperson said in a statement. \"As we have for many years, we will continue to mark Pride Month by offering an assortment of celebratory products, hosting internal programming to support our incredible team and sponsoring local events in neighborhoods across the country.\"",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/buy-now-pay-later-bnpl-loans-groceries/",
    "published": "Wed, 04 Jun 2025 16:23:35 -0400",
    "summary": "Roughly a quarter of consumers use \"buy now, pay later\" loans for ordinary expenses like groceries. That's worrisome, a personal finance expert says.",
    "story": [
      "A growing number of consumers are taking out \"buy now, pay later,\" or BNPL, loans to cover everyday living expenses, data shows, a sign of the precarious financial state facing many U.S. households.",
      "A quarter of Americans now use BNPL loans to pay for groceries, up 14% from last year, according to a recent survey from LendingTree. The personal finance firm also found that more people are using such financing to pay for clothing, technology and housewares.",
      "BNPL loans \u2014 which are readily available from financial technology companies such as Affirm, Klarna and PayPal, as well as from household names like Apple \u2014 let shoppers make interest-free purchases while spreading payments over several installments. The most common BNPL loans are \"pay in four\" products, which divide the total cost of a purchase, usually ranging from $50 to $1,000, into four equal payments. Consumers pay the first 25% at the point of sale and the remaining three installments over the next six weeks.",
      "Although such credit arrangements can help consumers afford an item in the short term, some BNPL loans can carry interest changes and fees, potentially leading consumers to rack up debt. According to LendingTree, 41% of customers who have used a BNPL loan say they have made a late payment in the past year, up from 34% the year prior. And while most lenders don't charge interest, they do charge late fees for missed payments, which can add up over time.",
      "Despite such risks, BNPL loans have exploded in popularity, including for modest transactions. For example, Klarna in March partnered with food delivery service DoorDash to offer a BNPL plan that consumers can use to pay for meal and grocery deliveries. DoorDash said it was launching the service to let customers postpone payment to \"a more convenient time, such as a date that aligns with their paycheck.\"",
      "LendingTree chief consumer finance analyst Matt Schulz said BNPL loan providers make it easy for customers to use them for a wide range of purchases. \"They give people more options, which can be good if it's managed well,\" he told CBS News' Kelly O'Grady.",
      "At the same time, the growing number of Americans using the loans to buy food \"clearly shows that there are a lot of people who are struggling with high costs at the grocery store and elsewhere, and who are looking for whatever ways they can find to help them make ends meet a little easier,\" Schulz said.",
      "\"If you make a bunch of purchases with a credit card, you're just making one payment at the end of the month,\" he added. \"But if you get a bunch of different BNPL loans, it can be a challenge to manage them. That's especially true if you're on a tight budget without a lot of wiggle room, and you're inexperienced with managing payments.\"",
      "LendingTree survey data shows that about one in four BNPL users say they've had at least three active BNPL loans at one time.",
      "\"That speaks to how easy these are to get and how easy it is to overspend on them,\" Schulz said.",

    "published": "Wed, 04 Jun 2025 05:00:18 -0400",
    "summary": "Republican tax bill requires both parents to have a Social Security number to qualify for the Child Tax Credit, a policy shift that would make millions of kids ineligible.",
    "story": [
      "A Republican-backed budget package includes a new restriction for the federal Child Tax Credit that could strip the benefit from millions of children who are U.S. citizens or legal residents, according to policy experts.",
      "The proposed tax and spending legislation \u2014 which proponents have dubbed the \"one big, beautiful bill\" \u2014 includes a\u00a0requirement that both a tax filer and the person's spouse have Social Security numbers to claim the Child Tax Credit, or CTC, for their kids. That means children with mixed-status parents, such as one parent who is a U.S. citizen and the second who is not, would no longer qualify for the tax credit, said Carl Davis, the research director of nonpartisan tax research group ITEP.",
      "Children who are born in the U.S., making them American citizens, but whose parents are undocumented would also be barred from the CTC. In some cases, one or both parents of a child who is authorized to be in the U.S. may lack a Social Security numbers. For example, parents who are in the U.S. on non-working visas, such as graduate students on education visas, would be prohibited from receiving the tax credit.",
      "The proposed restriction is part of a push by Republican lawmakers to ensure that tax breaks aren't going to undocumented immigrants. But the new policies would have the secondary effect of denying a tax credit to millions of children in the U.S. who currently qualify for the benefit, policy experts told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "The CTC, which now amounts to $2,000 per eligible child and has been shown to lift children out of poverty, currently requires that each kid has a valid Social Security number, but not their parents.",
      "Republicans say the bill would benefit families by boosting the CTC to $2,500 for three years, and then adjusting the tax credit each year for inflation so its value doesn't erode over time.",
      "A spokesperson for the Republican members of the congressional panel didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "In May, \"Working families, farmers and small businesses win with this bill,\" House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Jason Smith, a Republican from Missouri, said last month from the House floor. \"We expand and make permanent the small business deduction, and increase the Child Tax Credit, the standard deduction and the Death Tax exemption.\"",
      "He added, \"President Trump stopped the flow of illegal immigrants over our borders \u2014 this bill will stop the flow of taxpayer benefits to their pockets.\"",
      "4.5 million kids could be affected",
      "Most undocumented immigrants are already blocked from receiving most federal tax benefits, according to the Brookings Institution. The GOP tax bill could instead eliminate tax breaks for many immigrants who are in the U.S. legally, such as refugees or people on educational visas, the think tank said in a recent report.",
      "The tax bill could undergo more changes as it moves through the legislative process. The Senate is currently working on the measure after it squeaked through the House with a one-vote margin. Some senators have\u00a0voiced opposition, such as Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, who has said the bill will \"explode the debt.\"",
      "Should the CTC restriction be passed into law, however, it would impact roughly 4.5 million children, with the greatest number residing in California, Texas and Florida, according to an April\u00a0estimate from researchers at the Center for Migration Studies, Center on Poverty and Social Policy at Columbia University, ITEP and Boston University.",
      "\"The proposal now is actually to tighten the eligibility rules even more and to say, 'We basically don't care if the child is a citizen or not \u2014 we need every person in the household to be a citizen or otherwise have legal status in order for the credit to be paid out,\" Davis said.",
      "\"Treated differently\"",
      "Under the GOP bill, both spouses in a given household also must have a Social Security number to qualify for a number of other tax breaks, including provisions eliminating taxes on worker tips and overtime pay.",
      "That would create different tax rules for people who are married to spouses without a Social Security number, as well as for immigrants who are undocumented or who possess valid visas that don't allow them to have Social Security numbers, ITEP's Davis said.",
      "\"It seems to say, if your parents don't meet this criteria regarding their immigration status, then you will be treated differently as a child than all other children in the U.S. who were born of two parents that meet the qualifications,\" said Shelby Gonzales, vice president for immigration policy at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, nonpartisan think tank.",
      "Created in 1997, the Child Tax Credit received a boost in President Trump's 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which doubled the credit to $2,000 per eligible child, although that provision is set to expire at the end of 2025, when the credit is set to return to $1,000 per kid.",
      "The Republican tax bill would boost the CTC to $2,500 per child from tax years 2025 through 2028, at which point the credit would return to its $2,000 level. The tax credit would also be adjusted for inflation each year, ensuring that it wouldn't erode in value over time.",
      "Eligible parents can claim the CTC when filing their taxes, which can help families reduce their tax liability or receive a tax refund. During the pandemic, the CTC received a temporary boost that increased the maximum credit per child to $3,600 while paying out half the benefit through monthly payments, helping millions of families afford things like school supplies, clothing and educational programs for their kids.",
      "An effort last year to expand the CTC failed to advance in the Senate\u00a0in the face of widespread Republican opposition.",
      "\"When families have counted on this funding, it means making sure they have the school supplies, they have access to food and groceries,\" Gonzales said. \"That sets them up for a better trajectory in life, and all of that could be lost because they can't access this credit.\"",

      "California Attorney General Rob Bonta said Monday that the federalization of the California National Guard deprives the state of resources needed to protect citizens, particularly in the event of an emergency. The suit argues that the state's governor is commander-in-chief of the guard and must consent to its federalization. Newsom has not done so.",
      "\"President Trump's order calling federalized National Guard troops into Los Angeles \u2014 over the objections of the Governor and local law enforcement \u2014 is unnecessary and counterproductive.

    "published": "Mon, 09 Jun 2025 14:44:48 -0400",
    "summary": "Oklahoma Attorney General Gentner Drummond said his office will seek a sentence of life in prison for Richard Glossip.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Oklahoma's attorney general said Monday that the state plans to retry inmate Richard Glossip for the murder of his boss after the Supreme Court earlier this year granted him a new trial, but will not seek the death penalty against him.",
      "Gentner Drummond, the state's top prosecutor, said in a statement that his office does not intend to dismiss the existing first-degree murder charge brought against Glossip for the 1997 killing of Barry Van Treese, the owner of the Oklahoma City motel where Glossip worked.",
      "Instead, the attorney general said his office will seek a sentence of life in prison for Glossip because the man who confessed to bludgeoning Van Treese with a baseball bat, Justin Sneed, is serving a life sentence without the possibility of parole.",
      "Sneed, the key witness for the prosecution, claimed Glossip paid him $10,000 to kill Van Treese. Glossip was twice convicted of capital murder and sentenced to death. He has already served 27 years in prison and has long maintained his innocence.",
      "\"While it was clear to me and to the U.S. Supreme Court that Mr. Glossip did not receive a fair trial, I have never proclaimed his innocence,\" Drummond, a Republican who is running for governor of Oklahoma, said in a statement.",
      "The attorney general said that after the Supreme Court sided with Glossip earlier this year, his office reviewed the merits of the case against him and decided there is sufficient evidence to secure another conviction.",
      "\"The same United States Constitution that guarantees our rights also ensures the rights of the accused,\" the attorney general's statement continued. \"Unlike past prosecutors who allowed a key witness to lie on the stand, my office will make sure Mr. Glossip receives a fair trial based on hard facts, solid evidence and truthful testimony.\"",
      "Glossip had been on death row for more than two decades when the Supreme Court in February ruled 5-3 that violations of his due process rights entitled him to a new trial. The high court reversed a decision from the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals that upheld Glossip's conviction and death sentence.",
      "Glossip had been before the Supreme Court once before, in 2015, when he unsuccessfully challenged Oklahoma's lethal injection protocol on Eighth Amendment grounds. Before the high court ruled in his favor this year, he had nine execution dates scheduled and had eaten his \"last meal\" three times.",
      "At the center of Glossip's Supreme Court case was the testimony of Sneed, who had told prosecutors during the trial that he had never seen a psychiatrist, but was given lithium after he was arrested. But in 2022, the state found prosecutors' handwritten notes in a banker's box, which Drummond said showed that Sneed told the state he was given lithium after seeing a jailhouse psychiatrist and was diagnosed with bipolar disorder.",
      "Neither Sneed's diagnosis nor his treatment by the psychiatrist were disclosed to Glossip's defense team, which Drummond said indicated prosecutors elicited false testimony on the matter.",
      "\"Had the prosecution corrected Sneed on the stand, his credibility plainly would have suffered,\" Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote for the Supreme Court's majority. \"That correction would have revealed to the jury not just that Sneed was untrustworthy ... but also that Sneed was willing to lie to them under oath. Such a revelation would be significant in any case, and was especially so here where Sneed was already 'nobody's idea of a strong witness.'\"",
      "Following the high court's decision, Drummond said that his office would decide the appropriate course of action. The attorney general said Monday said the \"poor judgement and previous misconduct\" of the prosecutors originally handling Glossip's case has compounded pain and frustration for Van Treese's family.",
      "\"While I cannot go back 25 years and handle the case in the proper way that would have ensured true justice, I still have a duty to seek the justice that is available today,\" he said.",
      "Drummond told CBS News\u00a0in April that he believes Glossip is guilty of at least accessory after the fact, but the question is whether he is guilty of murder.",
      "\"I do not want to be culpable in executing somebody who is innocent, which is why I took great political risk to\u00a0review Mr. Glossip\u00a0and have sought a new trial,\" he said.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The White House and Republican leaders in Congress are urging lawmakers to quickly get behind the centerpiece of President Trump's legislative agenda, saying the ongoing immigration protests in Los Angeles add urgency to the push to secure additional resources for border security.",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson said on X on Monday that the legislation, which addresses Mr. Trump's tax, energy and immigration priorities, \"provides the ESSENTIAL funding needed to secure our nation[']s borders.\" Republicans call the legislation the \"one big, beautiful bill.\"",
      "\"The lawlessness happening in LA is ANOTHER reason why we need to pass the One Big Beautiful Bill IMMEDIATELY,\" Johnson said, pledging that Congress will support Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents who he said are \"fighting to keep Americans safe against illegal aliens AND the radical left.\"",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt shared a similar message earlier Monday, saying the scenes unfolding in some areas of Los Angeles \"prove that we desperately need more immigration enforcement personnel and resources.\"",
      "\"America must reverse the invasion unleashed by Joe Biden of millions of unvetted illegal aliens into our country,\" Leavitt said in a post on X. \"That's why President Trump's One Big, Beautiful Bill funds at least one million annual removals and hires 10,000 new ICE personnel, 5,000 new customs officers, and 3,000 new Border Patrol agents.\"",
      "The legislation is now in the hands of the Senate after the House narrowly approved it last month following weeks of intraparty disagreement over its components. Though the bulk of the funding allocated in the legislation goes toward tax cuts, it also includes resources aimed at bolstering border security and defense. It provides $46.5 billion for the border wall, $4.1 billion to hire Border Patrol agents and other personnel and more than $2 billion for signing and retention bonuses for agents. It also imposes an additional $1,000 fee for people who are filing for asylum in the U.S.",
      "The disagreement among Republicans over the bill has largely centered on cuts meant to offset the bill's spending, including restrictions to\u00a0Medicaid. In the House's razor-thin GOP majority, the disagreements threatened to tank the bill's progress at every stage. And as the bill moved to the Senate for consideration last week, Johnson warned the upper chamber against making significant changes that would throw off the delicate balance.",
      "Senate Republicans initially voiced support for separating the complicated tax components and border security provisions into two separate bills to deliver Mr. Trump a victory on immigration early on in his tenure. But House Republicans opposed the approach, expressing doubts that the president's agenda could pass through the narrow GOP majority in the lower chamber in separate parts. Senate Republicans are now seeking to amend the House-passed bill, sending it back to the House for approval with a goal of getting the legislation to the president's desk by the July 4 holiday. And with a 53-seat majority, the upper chamber can afford to lose just three Republicans.",
      "Last week, opposition from Elon Musk threatened to throw a wrench into the legislation's progress, after he stoked concerns by fiscal hawks about the bill's impact on the deficit. The episode, which began with Musk calling the bill \"a disgusting abomination,\" erupted into a dramatic and public feud between Musk and the president last week. But the dispute did not appear to spark significant new opposition the the bill in Congress.",
      "The urgency expressed Monday surrounding securing additional border resources comes as Mr. Trump called for the National Guard to enforce order in the L.A. area amid protests over activity by ICE, prompting a clash with California Gov. Gavin Newsom. Newsom warned that the move would inflame the situation, while urging that there is no shortage of law enforcement. The governor indicated late Sunday that his office plans to sue the Trump administration over Mr. Trump's move.",
      "Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem defended the president's move on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" Sunday, claiming Newsom \"has proven that he makes bad decisions.\"",
      "\"The president knows that [Newsom] makes bad decisions, and that's why the president chose the safety of this community over waiting for Gov. Newsom to get some sanity,\" Noem added.",

The justices ruled 7-2 to\u00a0uphold a Biden administration rule that regulates unserialized firearms called ghost guns.

      "The law prohibits medical treatments like puberty blockers or hormone therapy for transgender adolescents under the age of 18. Tennessee is one of 25 states that have passed laws that seek to restrict access to gender-affirming care for young people diagnosed with gender dysphoria.",
      "The legal battle over the ban is the first in which the Supreme Court waded into the debate over health care for transgender youth and it is one of the most significant cases before the justices this term. Following arguments in December, the court's conservative members appeared sympathetic to Tennessee's efforts to restrict access to the medical care for young people experiencing gender dysphoria.",
      "Birthright citizenship and nationwide injunctions",
      "The Supreme Court held a rare May argument session to consider a trio of emergency appeals from the Justice Department involving the president's executive order seeking to end birthright citizenship. The administration asked the high court in March to allow it to partially enforce the policy against states and individuals who are not involved in the three lawsuits while legal challenges to Mr. Trump's order move forward.",
      "If the court grants the Justice Department's request, the administration would be prevented from implementing the birthright citizenship measure against 22 states, seven individuals and two immigrants' rights organizations.",
      "But the dispute also involves whether the district court judges who issued injunctions blocking the policy nationwide had the authority to do so. The Trump administration has argued that these nationwide injunctions have gotten out of control. Judges have granted them in a slew of legal challenges to Mr. Trump's second-term policies.",
      "Some conservative members of the Supreme Court have been skeptical about nationwide injunctions. But during arguments last month, the justices appeared divided on the issue and struggled with some of the practicalities of allowing a challenged policy to broadly take effect while individuals bring their own lawsuits in courts around the country \u2014 the likely outcome if the justices decide to bar nationwide injunctions.",
      "Louisiana's congressional map",

      "The map was first drawn by state Republican lawmakers after the 2020 Census but has since been ensnared in years of legal wrangling. The latest version, now before the Supreme Court, was drawn after a federal district judge invalidated the first redistricting plan as a likely violation of Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act because it diluted Black voting strength.",
      "That judge ordered the state to put a remedial plan in place that had two majority-Black congressional districts, and state GOP lawmakers ultimately approved a map with that makeup. But the second iteration of the voting boundaries were struck down by a divided three-judge district court panel, which concluded the map was an unlawful racial gerrymander.",
      "The dispute demonstrates the challenges state lawmakers face when trying to balance compliance with the Voting Rights Act without relying too much on race during the drawing of political lines, which can violate the Constitution's Equal Protection Clause.",
      "Parental opt-outs from school lessons with LGBTQ themes",
      "In the case known as Mahmoud v. Taylor, the justices are considering whether a Maryland school district unconstitutionally burdened parents' First Amendment right to exercise their religion freely when it requires their children to participate in instruction on gender and sexuality that violates the families' religious beliefs.",
      "The dispute arose after the Montgomery County Board of Education introduced \"LGBTQ-inclusive\" storybooks for elementary school students into its English Language Arts curriculum in 2022. The board initially allowed parents to opt their children out of reading and instruction that involved the storybooks, but in March 2023, the board said parents would no longer be able to have their kids excused.",
      "With more than 160,000 students, Montgomery County is home to Maryland's largest public school system.",
      "A group of families sued the Board of Education, arguing that denial of the notice and opt-outs violated their right to exercise their religion freely under the First Amendment because it overrode their freedom to direct the religious upbringing of their children.",
      "The Supreme Court appeared sympathetic to the parents during oral arguments in March and seemed inclined to require that public schools give parents the ability to opt their children out of instruction featuring the books.",
      "Defunding Planned Parenthood",
      "South Carolina moved to withhold state Medicaid funds from a Planned Parenthood affiliate in the state in 2018, kicking off the protracted legal battle now before the Supreme Court.",
      "The state's attempt to defund Planned Parenthood stemmed from an executive order signed by Gov. Henry McMaster that directed South Carolina's health department to deem abortion providers unqualified to provide family-planning services through Medicaid and terminate enrollment agreements.",
      "The organization and Julie Edwards, a Planned Parenthood patient, then filed a lawsuit challenging the termination decision, alleging that it violated Edwards' right to choose her provider under the Medicaid Act.",
      "The question before the Supreme Court is technical: whether Medicaid beneficiaries can sue over a state's decision to exclude their chosen provider from their Medicaid programs. If the Supreme Court finds that Medicaid recipients do not have the right to sue, it would limit patients' ability to enforce a provision of the Medicaid Act that allows them to seek care from the qualified and willing provider of their choosing.",
      "The high court heard oral argument in April and appeared divided on the issue.",
      "Age verification for pornographic websites",
      "Texas enacted a law in 2023 that requires pornography websites to confirm that visitors are at least 18 years old or face civil penalties of up to $10,000 per day. Texas is one of at least 19 states with age-verification laws on the books, which their defenders say are aimed at protecting children from accessing sexual content on the internet.",
      "But free speech organizations and trade groups representing the adult entertainment industry argue that these laws burden adults' access to content they are legally allowed to consume in violation of the First Amendment.",
      "The issue before the Supreme Court in the case known as Free Speech Coalition v. Paxton is whether a federal appeals court applied the correct standard of judicial review when it evaluated Texas' age-verification law. The U.S. Court of Appeals applied what's known as rational-basis review, the least stringent level. But the trade groups and the Biden administration said that the court should've applied the most demanding standard of review, strict scrutiny, because the age-verification law impedes adults' access to constitutionally protected speech.",
      "The challengers asked the Supreme Court to find that the requirement is subject to strict-scrutiny, and that it cannot satisfy that test.",
      "Texas has been able to enforce the age-verification measure while the case proceeds. Even if the Supreme Court rules that the 5th Circuit applied the wrong standard of review, it could order additional proceedings and allow the law to remain in effect while they play out.",
      "The fate of the FCC's Universal Service Fund",
      "This pair of cases before the Supreme Court involves the Federal Communications Commission's Universal Service Fund, a federal program that aims to expand phone and internet access to underserved communities.",
      "The fund is administered by the Universal Service Administrative Company, which determines the amount telecommunications carriers must contribute to it and disburses that money to program beneficiaries. Contribution fees are based on a percentage of carriers' revenue, and companies often pass on those costs to consumers.",
      "The cases give the high court the chance to revive the nondelegation doctrine, a long-dormant legal principle that says Congress cannot delegate its legislative authority to executive branch agencies. The Supreme Court last invoked the nondelegation doctrine in 1935.",
      "A conservative organization called Consumers' Research challenged the legality of the Universal Service Fund in 2022, arguing that Congress unconstitutionally delegated its legislative authority to the FCC, which in turn transferred power to the fund's administrator.",
      "But after arguments in March, the Supreme Court appeared likely to reject the challenge and uphold the Universal Service Fund.",
      "Health and Human Services' preventive care task force",
      "The case Kennedy v. Braidwood Management involves the structure of the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, an entity within the Department of Health and Human Services that recommends the preventive-care services that must be covered by insurance plans without cost-sharing under the Affordable Care Act.",
      "Among the preventive services recommended by the task force are screenings for lung, cervical and colorectal cancers, as well as diabetes; statin medications to reduce the risk of heart disease and stroke; and medication to prevent HIV, known as PrEP.",
      "The task force's recommendation in 2019 that PrEP be covered by insurance plans at no-cost to patients gave rise to the dispute before the Supreme Court. A group of four individuals and two small businesses filed a lawsuit claiming that the Task Force's members were unconstitutionally appointed, rendering its recommendations invalid.",
      "The plaintiffs argued that the task force's structure violates the Constitution's Appointments Clause because it is composed of principal officers who must be nominated by the president and confirmed by the Senate. But the Biden administration and now the Trump administration said the members of the panel are inferior officers subject to supervision by the Health and Human Services secretary, and therefore do not require nomination by the president and Senate approval.",
      "If the Supreme Court finds that task force members are inferior officers, it could send the case back to the appeals court to decide whether Congress gave the head of the Health and Human Services Department the authority to appoint them. Indeed, several days after the court heard arguments in the case, the Supreme Court asked the two sides to file additional briefs addressing that issue.",

      "Washington \u2014 President Trump's\u00a0proclamation\u00a0 barring travelers and immigrants from 12 countries, and restricting the entry of nationals from seven other nations,\u00a0went into effect early Monday, June 9.",
      "With the move, the White House cited concerns about national security. The president said the recent attack at a march supporting Israeli hostages in Boulder, Colorado,\u00a0had \"underscored the extreme dangers posed to our country by the entry of foreign nationals who are not properly vetted, as well as those who come here as temporary visitors and overstay their visas.\"",
      "\"We don't want them,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "An internal memo from Customs and Border Protection issued on June 7 said \"the suspensions and limitations on entry for nationals of the above-listed countries are effective at 12:01 am Eastern Daylight Time on June 9, 2025 for travelers that do not have a valid visa issued on or prior to June 8, 2025.\"",
      "Here's what to know about the travel bans:",
      "What are the travel ban countries?",
      "With some exceptions, the proclamation bans the entry of foreigners from 12 countries who are seeking to come to the U.S. permanently as legal immigrants, as well as those with temporary visas, including tourists:",

      "When does the ban take effect?",
      "The ban went into effect at 12:01 a.m. on Monday, June 9.",
      "Why were the countries selected?",
      "On the first day of his second administration, Mr. Trump directed officials to perform a security review of high-risk regions and make recommendations for where immigration and travel restrictions should be imposed.",
      "The president said the factors considered were \"the largescale presence of terrorists, failure to cooperate on visa security, inability to verify travelers' identities, inadequate record keeping of criminal histories and persistently high rates of illegal visa overstays, and other things.\"",
      "\"Very simply, we cannot have open migration from any country where we cannot safely and reliably vet and screen those who seek to enter the United States,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "The president cited the recent attack in Boulder, where an Egyptian national was charged, as part of the justification for the bans. Egypt is not among the countries on the White House's list. But the proclamation directed officials to assess the \"adequacy\" of Egypt's vetting policies \"in light of recent events.\"",
      "Are there exceptions to the new travel ban?",
      "The president's decree contains certain exemptions, including for U.S. permanent residents and the spouses and children of U.S. citizens who have \"clear and convincing evidence of identity and family relationship.\"",
      "The proclamation also outlines exemptions for Afghans who assisted American forces and have special visas; diplomats; athletes coming to the U.S. for the World Cup, the Olympics and other major sporting events; dual nationals with a passport from a country not listed in the president's decree; and for adoptions.",
      "Mr. Trump said the list could be revised if countries make \"material improvements,\" and new countries could be added \"as threats emerge around the world.\"",
      "Did Trump do this before?",
      "The president's actions follow a series of travel bans issued during his first administration that initially targeted predominantly Muslim countries. Like those orders, his latest proclamation could be subject to lawsuits, although the Supreme Court ultimately upheld the revised ban from his first term, which the White House noted in a fact sheet outlining his second-term bans.",
      "The president touted his first-term travel bans in his video statement released Wednesday.",
      "\"In my first term, my powerful travel restrictions were one of our most successful policies, and they were a key part of preventing major foreign terror attacks on American soil,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "In January 2017, Mr. Trump signed a travel ban restricting the entry of most citizens of Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. The ban sparked widespread outcry, creating chaos at airports and prompting legal challenges, as opponents argued the ban was discriminatory.",
      "Then in March 2017, Mr. Trump removed Iraq from the list and added Chad, Venezuela and North Korea. The president expanded the ban in 2020, adding immigration restrictions for nationals of Nigeria, Eritrea, Sudan, Tanzania, Myanmar and Kyrgyzstan. Chad was later removed from the list.",
      "The third iteration of the president's first-term ban was upheld by the Supreme Court in the summer of 2018. At the time, conservative justices cited the president's broad authority to restrict the entry of foreigners on national security grounds. When President Joe Biden took office, he scrapped that ban.",

    "summary": "Demonstrators hit the streets again in L.A. after President Trump deployed the National Guard due to protests against ICE raids.",
    "story": [
      "Tensions in Los Angeles escalated Sunday as thousands of protesters took to the streets in response to President Trump's deployment of the National Guard, blocking off a major freeway and setting self-driving cars on fire as law enforcement used tear gas, rubber bullets and flash-bangs to control the crowd.",
      "California Gov. Gavin Newsom said Monday that his office intends to sue the Trump administration for deploying the Guard without consulting him, a move he called \"illegal and immoral\"\u00a0in a social media post Sunday.",
      "In another post Monday morning, Newsom said Mr. Trump \"illegally acted to federalize the National Guard,\" adding, \"We're suing him.\"",
      "Thirty-nine people were arrested over the weekend, said Los Angeles Police Chief Jim McDonnell at a news conference Sunday evening. Most were arrested Saturday, according to the police chief, who also addressed complaints accusing the police department of responding too slowly to the unrest.",
      "\"We can't participate in any way in civil immigration enforcement,\" McDonnell said.",
      "He reminded reporters that police must comply with the California Values Act, a Los Angeles \"sanctuary city\" ordinance also known as SB 54, which prevents local and state law enforcement agencies from assisting federal immigration enforcement activity.",
      "On Sunday, many protesters dispersed as evening fell and police declared an unlawful assembly, a precursor to officers moving in and arresting people who didn't leave.",
      "But some of those remaining threw objects at police from behind a makeshift barrier that spanned the width of a street and others hurled chunks of concrete, rocks, electric scooters and fireworks at California Highway Patrol officers and their vehicles parked on the closed southbound 101 Freeway. Officers ran under an overpass to take cover.",
      "CBS News Los Angeles reported that several fires were set in dumpsters and trash bins and at least one store had windows shattered by alleged looters. Dozens of buildings were tagged with graffiti, including the LAPD Headquarters, the U.S. Courthouse and the old Los Angeles Times building.",
      "Footage from the CBS News Los Angeles helicopter showed that multiple windows of the police headquarters had been shattered as well.",
      "Separately, San Francisco police reported 60 arrests Sunday night. Police said people were taking part in \"First Amendment activities\" but then began committing crimes \"ranging from assault to felony vandalism and causing property damage.\" An unlawful assembly was declared but several people kept \"engaging in illegal activity,\" police said. Two officers were hurt, though the injuries weren't life-threatening. Police said the demonstrators then vandalized buildings, a police cruiser and other property, and officers began arresting people who didn't comply with the dispersal order.",
      "L.A. demonstrations intensified",
      "Sunday's protests in Los Angeles, a sprawling city of 4 million people, were centered in several blocks of downtown. It was the third and most intense day of demonstrations against Mr. Trump's immigration crackdown in the region, as the arrival of around 300 Guard troops spurred anger and fear among many residents.",
      "The Guard was deployed specifically to protect federal buildings, including the downtown detention center where protesters concentrated.",
      "Los Angeles Police Chief Jim McDonnell said officers were \"overwhelmed\" by the remaining protesters. He said they included regular agitators who show up at demonstrations to cause trouble.",
      "Dozens of people were arrested throughout the weekend of the protest.",
      "Mr. Trump responded to McDonnell on Truth Social, telling him to arrest protesters in face masks.",
      "\"Looking really bad in L.A. BRING IN THE TROOPS!!!\" he wrote.",
      "Starting in the morning, the troops stood shoulder to shoulder, carrying long guns and riot shields as protesters shouted \"shame\" and \"go home.\" After some closely approached the guard members, another set of uniformed officers advanced on the group, shooting smoke-filled canisters into the street.",
      "Minutes later, the L.A. police fired rounds of crowd-control munitions to disperse the protesters, who they said were assembled unlawfully. Much of the group then moved to block traffic on the 101 Freeway until state patrol officers cleared them from the roadway by late afternoon.",
      "Nearby, at least four self-driving Waymo cars were set on fire, sending large plumes of black smoke into the sky and exploding intermittently as the electric vehicles burned. By evening, police had issued an unlawful assembly order shutting down several blocks of downtown Los Angeles.",
      "Flash-bangs echoed out every few seconds into the evening.",
      "How the demonstrations started",
      "The arrival of the National Guard followed two days of protests that began Friday in downtown Los Angeles before spreading on Saturday to Paramount, a heavily Latino city south of the city, and neighboring Compton.",
      "Federal agents arrested immigrants in LA's fashion district, in a Home Depot parking lot and at several other locations on Friday. The next day, they were staging at a Department of Homeland Security office near another Home Depot in Paramount, which drew out protesters who suspected another raid. Federal authorities later said there was no enforcement activity at that Home Depot.",
      "The weeklong tally of immigrant arrests in the LA area climbed above 100, federal authorities said. Many more were arrested while protesting, including a prominent union leader who was accused of impeding law enforcement.",
      "What are officials saying?",
      "Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom requested that Mr. Trump remove the guard members in a letter Sunday afternoon, calling their deployment a \"serious breach of state sovereignty.\" He was in Los Angeles meeting with local law enforcement and officials.",
      "The deployment appeared to be the first time in decades that a state's National Guard was activated without a request from its governor, a significant escalation against those who have sought to hinder the administration's mass deportation efforts.",
      "Newsom and Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass blamed the increasingly aggressive protests on the president's decision to deploy the Guard, calling it a move designed to enflame tensions. They've both urged protesters to remain peaceful.",
      "\"What we're seeing in Los Angeles is chaos that is provoked by the administration,\" Bass said in an afternoon press conference. \"This is about another agenda, this isn't about public safety.\"",
      "But McDonnell, the LAPD chief, said the protests were following a similar pattern for episodes of civil unrest, with things ramping up in the second and third days.",
      "He pushed back against claims by the Trump administration that the LAPD had failed to help federal authorities when protests broke out Friday after a series of immigration raids. His department responded as quickly as it could, and had not been notified in advance of the raids and therefore was not pre-positioned for protests, he said.",
      "Newsom, meanwhile, has repeatedly said that California authorities had the situation under control. He mocked Mr. Trump for posting a congratulatory message to the Guard on social media before troops had even arrived in Los Angeles, and said on MSNBC that Mr. Trump never floated deploying the Guard during a Friday phone call. He called the president a \"stone-cold liar.\"",
      "The admonishments didn't deter the administration.",
      "\"It's a bald-faced lie for Newsom to claim there was no problem in Los Angeles before President Trump got involved,\" White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson said in a statement.",
      "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said in a social media post\u00a0that if the violence continues, he would mobilize \"active duty Marines\" from Camp Pendleton in San Diego County. He said the Marines were already on \"high alert.\"",
      "When asked what the threshold is for sending in the Marines, Mr. Trump said Sunday: \"The bar is what I think it is.\"",
      "Democratic California Rep. Maxine Waters on Sunday strongly rebuked the president's decision to deploy the National Guard, calling the situation \"outrageous\" and \"horrible\" and adding that she believes Mr. Trump is using L.A., a sanctuary city, as an example.",
      "\"He's using deportation as a way to enhance his position with all those right-wingers out there who do not want this country to be a country of people coming from other places,\" the Democrat told a reporter outside the Metropolitan Detention Center. \"I think he's up to creating martial law.\"",
      "Former Vice President Kamala Harris also condemned the Trump administration's actions in L.A. on Sunday, calling the deployment of the National Guard \"a dangerous escalation meant to provoke chaos.\"",
      "\"In addition to the recent ICE raids in Southern California and across our nation, it is part of the Trump Administration's cruel, calculated agenda to spread panic and division,\" said Harris, who also previously served as a senator and attorney general of California. \"This Administration's actions are not about public safety \u2014 they're about stoking fear. Fear of a community demanding dignity and due process.\"",
      "Some perspective on the protests",
      "The protests didn't reach the size of past demonstrations that brought the National Guard to Los Angeles, including the Watts and Rodney King riots, and the 2020 protests against police violence, in which Newsom requested the assistance of federal troops.",
      "The last time the National Guard was activated without a governor's permission was in 1965, when President Lyndon B. Johnson sent troops to protect a civil rights march in Alabama, according to the Brennan Center for Justice.",
      "Eleanor  Watson and \n                                                  \n                                  Camilo  Montoya-Galvez\n                  \n        contributed to this report.",

    "summary": "Americans think tariffs will lead to higher prices; Trump's perceived goals fare better than his approach.",
    "story": [
      "Views of the Trump administration's deportation program headed into this weekend with positive net approval from Americans, including continued strong backing from the Republican base \u2014 but also heavily shaped by contrasting views about which people, and how many, are being targeted for deportation.",
      "A slight majority feel the administration's deportation efforts are prioritizing people they believe are dangerous criminals. Those who say this are very supportive of the program, and feel the program is making people in the U.S. safer.",
      "But if people don't think it is dangerous criminals who are the focus of the deportation effort, support drops dramatically.",
      "The survey was completed just prior to Saturday's protests and events in Los Angeles.",
      "In terms of how many people the administration is trying to deport, more is not necessarily better in the public mind.",
      "Half of Americans say Trump is deporting more people than they thought he would during the 2024 campaign. And most in this group disapprove of the deportation program.",
      "Some of this is tied to views on process: those people are also more apt than others to say potential deportees should get a hearing and due process.",
      "On balance, more people see the program making the U.S. safer, compared to less safe.",
      "That's related to the fact that more believe the administration is prioritizing the deportation of people who they believe are dangerous criminals.",
      "For the Americans who feel the administration is trying to deport more people than they expected, they're less approving of the program.",
      "On that topic of process, big percentages of Americans continue to say it is not acceptable if legal residents are mistakenly deported as part of the program. MAGA Republicans are more divided on this question, but a majority say it wouldn't be acceptable.",
      "A lot of this is partisan, and over time, it has become even more so. Independents aren't as supportive of the deportation program as they were a couple of months ago, leaving the GOP base as the only partisan group with majority backing of the program now. But it is an overwhelming one among Republicans.",
      "Then, there's also the potential economic impact. Unlike the net-positive views about safety, more Americans think the deportation program will weaken than strengthen the economy.",
      "Views on the economic impact also show some connection to longstanding views about immigrants more generally (though not necessarily those in the country illegally).",
      "Those who feel immigrants take jobs away from Americans are far more approving of the deportation program. (It's a view that is much more tied to ideology and partisanship than income, with majorities of conservatives and Republicans saying this about immigrants.)",
      "A larger share of Americans say immigrants generally fill jobs Americans won't do. That in turn is related to the view that the deportation program will weaken the U.S. economy.",
      "In sum, there's a gap regarding the deportation program, with more people saying they like the goals than the approach.",
      "Views of the national economy have stabilized a bit \u2014 they aren't majority positive (and have not been for years), but are off the 2025 lows they hit late this past winter.",
      "Support for new tariffs in general remains net negative. Americans continue to think they will lead to higher prices at least in the short run, and often in the long run too. That's generally been the case for a while.",
      "Here again, more people like what they think are Trump's goals with tariffs than his approach.",
      "Most Americans think the president is trying to help U.S. manufacturing and business. (There's plenty of cynicism too, with even more saying he's trying to help the wealthy.)",
      "On another economic front, few people feel they know a lot of the specifics of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act right now. This isn't too different from the initial phases of other big bills in Congress of past years, like the Build Back Better Act in 2021, for example. That may be a function of the fact that the legislation is still being debated. Most do feel they have a general sense of it.",
      "Views about the potential impact are mixed and may reflect that collective unfamiliarity with the bill. (Though the people who think they know a lot of the specifics are more likely to think it will hurt them, as well as raise their taxes.)",
      "Given the stated goals of the bill include keeping the Trump tax cuts in place, a combined majority of Americans do think it'll either lower or not impact their taxes either way.",
      "But in terms of groups, only about a third of Americans think this bill would help the middle or working class, and most think it will hurt poor people",
      "Americans think this bill will decrease health insurance coverage, not increase it, and a majority says the bill would increase the federal deficit. (Comparably fewer Republicans think the deficit will increase, though. For context, historically the party's rank and file have seen tax and spending cuts as a spur to long term growth that could lower it.)",
      "The politics of it all",
      "Trump's approval rating on immigration continues to be higher than his marks on the economy and inflation. As has typically been the case in his second term, he gets his highest specific ratings from Republicans on immigration. His overall job approval remains unchanged.",
      "Meanwhile, as focus turns more toward Congress as they debate the bill, we do see doubts among Democrats \u2014 whose party is in the minority \u2014 about their party's perceived ability to challenge Trump's policies.",
      "Of the three \u2014 Trump, the Republicans, and the Democrats \u2014 no one is above water with a majority on being seen as \"fighting for people like you.\" But Donald Trump does rank highest on the \"fights for\" by comparison.",
      "But there is mostly the view among Democrats that their party hasn't been effective at challenging Donald Trump's policies.",
      "This CBS News/YouGov survey was conducted with a nationally representative sample of 2,428\u00a0 U.S. adults interviewed between June 4-6, 2025. The sample was weighted to be representative of adults nationwide according to gender, age, race, and education, based on the U.S. Census American Community Survey and Current Population Survey, as well as 2024 presidential vote.

    "summary": "White House National Economic Council director Kevin Hassett signaled the administration would be open to Medicare cuts if senators uncover fraud or abuse as they look at the bill.",
    "story": [
      "White House National Economic Council director Kevin Hassett said Sunday the Trump administration is not targeting Medicare in its sweeping budget proposal, but signaled the administration would be open to changes if senators uncover fraud or abuse as they look at the bill.",
      "\"If somebody finds waste, fraud and abuse in Medicare, then of course we would look at it,\" Hassett said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\" \"But there have been a lot of false stories about Medicare being on the table, and it's totally not on the table.\"",
      "Senate Republicans this week are working on the House-passed budget bill, dubbed the \"One Big Beautiful Bill\" by President Trump, which includes deep tax cuts, border security measures, and changes to Medicaid and food assistance programs.",
      "Hassett on Sunday pushed back against the idea that Republicans are targeting Medicare for cuts.",
      "\"That story that got out last week was covered as our intent to go after Medicare,\" Hassett said bluntly. \"And it was just a big fake news story.\"",
      "Asked whether the administration would revisit the Medicare provision if the Senate identifies abuse, Hassett said they would. \"I've seen a massive amount of waste, fraud and abuse in Medicaid, and I've not been briefed on Medicare waste, fraud and abuse. But if they find something then, of course, we would look at it,\" he said.",
      "The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated earlier this week that the bill will add\u00a0 $2.4 trillion to the national debt over the next decade. Sen. Thom Tillis told Charlotte's WCNC on Thursday that he supports legislation that would address waste in the Medicare Advantage Program. This addition, he said, would not touch beneficiaries but would focus on \"eliminating waste, fraud, and abuse of the Medicare Advantage program, including costly government overpayments to insurance companies.\"",
      "To pay for some of Mr. Trump's tax reforms, such as extending his 2017 tax cuts and eliminating tax on tips, there are cuts to several programs. Republicans have insisted they are not cutting Medicaid, and reductions in the low-income entitlement program have become one of the most charged parts of the bill. In a closed-door session with members of the Republican conference days before the bill's passage, sources in the room told CBS News Mr. Trump said, \"Don't f*** around with Medicaid.\"",
      "House Republicans passed the bill late last month on a 215\u2013214 vote, sending it to the Senate where GOP leaders are weighing revisions to secure enough votes under budget reconciliation rules.",
      "\"What we want to see done now is we want the Senate to pass the bill, and then we want the House and Senate to work out their differences,\" Hassett said. \"So right now, the Senate has to get the votes they need to pass the bill, and we're supporting them in that process.\"",
      "Some Republican senators, including Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, and Josh Hawley of Missouri, have voiced concerns about Medicaid provisions in the bill, particularly new monthly premium requirements for low-income recipients. Their opposition highlights ongoing uncertainty as Senate GOP leaders work to secure enough votes. The bill can't afford to lose more than four votes in the Senate, granted that all Democrats vote against it.",
      "Hawley has called possible Medicaid cuts \"both morally wrong and politically suicidal.\"",
      "When asked about Hawley's concerns, Hassett said, \"I'd have to go see what he has and talk to him about it. And I also would want to talk to the president about the specific matter. So I can't speak to that one.\"",
      "The administration has repeatedly argued that failure to pass the legislation could hurt the broader economy.",
      "\"If we don't pass this bill, then we lose 6 to 7 million jobs and 4% GDP,\" Hassett said Sunday. \"If we create the jobs that we have in the bill, then we're going to create a heck of a lot more insurance than what we're talking about in waste, fraud and abuse.\"",
      "Senate Republicans are expected to release their version of the bill in the coming days. If there are significant changes, it will then have to go back to the House for final passage before landing on Mr. Trump's desk.",

    "summary": "Sen. Elizabeth Warren said a \"petty social media fight\" between President Trump and billionaire Elon Musk should not jeopardize U.S. national security.",
    "story": [
      "Sen. Elizabeth Warren is asking Secretary of State Marco Rubio for information on the Trump administration's contingency plans if billionaire Elon Musk breaches his companies' current contracts with the U.S. amid the ongoing public fallout between him and President Trump.",
      "In a letter to Rubio as acting national security adviser and obtained by CBS News, Warren said Mr. Trump and Musk's public disagreements about the upcoming reconciliation bill that escalated into a public online spat could \"have serious implications for U.S. national security.\"",
      "The Massachusetts Democrat mentioned Mr. Trump's proposal to terminate Musk's government contracts and subsidies, which the world's richest man followed with a threat that SpaceX would \"begin decommissioning its Dragon spacecraft immediately.\" Musk has since walked back his threat.",
      "\"No petty social media fight between the president and a billionaire should jeopardize U.S. national security,\" Warren said.",
      "In addition to contingency plans for SpaceX, the senator asked for information regarding the impact on U.S. agencies' satellite communications if Musk's Starlink is turned off. Additionally, she asked Rubio to provide any analysis that the Trump administration has conducted \"of its authorities and options under the Defense Production Act to address vendor lock, monopolies, or contractor refusal to meet national security needs.\"",
      "She asked to receive answers to her questions by June 14, whether through a classified briefing or preferably a public response that can be released to Congress and the public, the letter said.",
      "Warren has been a vocal opponent of Musk and his involvement in the Trump administration. Last week, she released a report that outlines instances her office has found of Musk benefiting from it.",
      "Musk's rocket company has received tens of billions of dollars from the federal government over the last decade, including $3.8 billion in the 2024 fiscal year alone, according to federal records.",
      "The bulk of those federal grants are from NASA, which has paid SpaceX billions over the last decade to ferry astronauts and supplies to and from the International Space Station. The agency has also awarded SpaceX upwards of $2 billion in recent years to design and build a lunar lander, as part of NASA's Artemis program, which aims to return humans to the moon for the first time in a half-century.",
      "While the public spat appears to have cooled somewhat, Mr. Trump told NBC News' Kristen Welker in a phone interview on Saturday that he has no plans to make up with the mega-billionaire.",
      "\"I'm too busy doing other things,\" Trump continued. \"You know, I won an election in a landslide. I gave him a lot of breaks, long before this happened, I gave him breaks in my first administration, and saved his life in my first administration, I have no intention of speaking to him.\"",
      "When asked by a reporter Friday if he's still considering rolling back subsidies to Musk as a money-saving move, Mr. Trump suggested he was open to it.",
      "\"He's got a lot of money, he gets a lot of subsidy. So we'll take a look at that,\" the president said on Air Force One. \"Only if it's fair for him and for the country. I would certainly think about it, but it has to be fair.\"",
      "This isn't the first time the president has needled Musk over his companies' federal subsidies. In a 2022 feud, Mr. Trump claimed Musk would be \"worthless\" without hefty subsidies for \"electric cars that don't drive long enough\" and \"rocketships to nowhere.\"",
      "The two mended their relationship then and Musk spent hundreds of millions to help elect Mr. Trump in 2024. The billionaire went on to lead the Trump White House's cost-cutting Department of Government Efficiency until last week.",

    "published": "Thu, 05 Jun 2025 05:00:00 -0400",
    "summary": "The Trump administration wants to shutter the CDC's National Asthma Control Program, which provides millions in funding to state-administered initiatives aimed at fighting the disease.",
    "story": [
      "Esther Bejarano's son was 11 months old when asthma landed him in the hospital. She didn't know what had triggered his symptoms \u2014 neither she nor her husband had asthma \u2014 but she suspected it was the pesticides sprayed on the agricultural fields near her family's home.",
      "Pesticides are a known contributor to asthma and are commonly used where Bejarano lives in California's Imperial Valley, a landlocked region that straddles two counties on the U.S.-Mexico border and is one of the main producers of the nation's winter crops. It also has some of the worst air pollution in the nation and one of the highest rates of childhood asthma emergency room visits in the state, according to data collected by the California Department of Public Health.",
      "Bejarano has since learned to manage her now-19-year-old son's asthma and works at Comite Civico del Valle, a local rights organization focused on environmental justice in the Imperial Valley. The organization trains health care workers to educate patients on proper asthma management, enabling them to avoid hospitalization and eliminate triggers at home. The course is so popular that there's a waiting list, Bejarano said.",
      "But the group's Asthma Management Academy program and similar initiatives nationwide face extinction with the Trump administration's mass layoffs, grant cancellations, and proposed budget cuts at the Department of Health and Human Services and the Environmental Protection Agency. Asthma experts fear the cumulative impact of the reductions could result in more ER visits and deaths, particularly for children and people in low-income communities \u2014 populations disproportionately vulnerable to the disease.",
      "\"Asthma is a preventive condition,\" Bejarano said. \"No one should die of asthma.\"",
      "Asthma can block airways, making it hard to breathe, and in severe cases can cause death if not treated quickly. Nearly 28 million people in the U.S. have asthma, and about 10 people still die every day from the disease, according to the Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America.",
      "In May, the White House released a budget proposal that would permanently shutter\u00a0the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Asthma Control Program, which was already gutted by federal health department layoffs in April. It's unclear whether Congress will approve the closure.",
      "Last year, the program allotted $33.5 million to state-administered initiatives in 27 states, Puerto Rico, and Washington, D.C., to help communities with asthma education. The funding is distributed in four-year grant cycles, during which the programs receive up to $725,000 each annually.",
      "Comite Civico del Valle's academy in Southern California, a clinician workshop in Houston, and asthma medical management training in Allentown, Pennsylvania \u2014 ranked the most challenging U.S. city to live in with asthma \u2014 are among the programs largely surviving on these grants. The first year of the current grant cycle ends Aug. 31, and it's unknown whether funding will continue beyond then.",
      "Data suggests that the CDC's National Asthma Control Program has had a significant impact. The agency's own research has shown that the program saves $71 in health care costs for every $1 invested. And the asthma death rate decreased 44% between the 1999 launch of the program and 2021, according to the American Lung Association.",
      "\"Losing support from the CDC will have devastating impacts on asthma programs in states and communities across the country, programs that we know are improving the lives of millions of people with asthma,\" said Anne Kelsey Lamb, director of the Public Health Institute's Regional Asthma Management and Prevention program. \"And the thing is that we know a lot about what works to help people keep their asthma well controlled, and that's why it's so devastating.\"",
      "The Trump administration cited cost savings and efficiency in its April announcement of the cuts to HHS. Requests for comment from the White House and HHS's CDC about cuts to federal asthma and related programs were not answered.",
      "The information wars",
      "Fresno, in the heart of California's Central Valley, is one of the country's top 20 \"asthma capitals,\" with high rates of asthma and related emergencies and deaths. It's home to programs that receive funding through the National Asthma Control Program. Health care professionals there also rely on another aspect of the program that is under threat if it's shuttered: countrywide data.",
      "The federal asthma program collects information on asthma rates and offers a tool to study prevalence and rates of death from the disease, see what populations are most affected, and assess state and local trends. Asthma educators and health care providers worry that the loss of these numbers could be the biggest impact of the cuts, because it would mean a dearth of information crucial to forming educated recommendations and treatment plans.",
      "\"How do we justify the services we provide if the data isn't there?\" said Graciela Anaya, director of community health at the Central California Asthma Collaborative in Fresno.",
      "Mitchell Grayson, chair of the Asthma and Allergy Foundation's Medical Scientific Council, is similarly concerned.",
      "\"My fear is we're going to live in a world that is frozen in Jan. 19, 2025, as far as data, because that was the last time you know that this information was safely collected,\" he said.",
      "Grayson, an allergist who practices in Columbus, Ohio, said he also worries government websites will delete important recommendations that asthma sufferers avoid heavy air pollution, get annual flu shots, and get COVID-19 vaccines.",
      "Disproportionate risk",
      "Asthma disproportionately affects communities of color because of \"historic structural issues,\" said Lynda Mitchell, CEO of the Asthma and Allergy Network, citing a higher likelihood of living in public housing or near highways and other pollution sources.",
      "She and other experts in the field said cuts to diversity initiatives across federal agencies, combined with the rollback of environmental protections, will have an outsize impact on these at-risk populations.",
      "In December, the Biden administration awarded nearly $1.6 billion through the EPA's Community Change Grants program to help disadvantaged communities address pollution and climate threats. The Trump administration moved to cut this funding in March. The grant freezes, which have been temporarily blocked by the courts, are part of a broader effort by the Trump EPA to eliminate aid to environmental justice programs across the agency.",
      "In 2023 and 2024, the National Institutes of Health's Climate Change and Health Initiative received $40 million for research, including on the link between asthma and climate change. The Trump administration has moved to cut that money. And a March memo essentially halted all NIH grants focused on diversity, equity, and inclusion, or DEI \u2014 funds many of the asthma programs serving low-income communities rely on to operate.",
      "On top of those cuts, environmental advocates like Isabel Gonz\u00e1lez Whitaker of Memphis, Tennessee, worry that the proposed reversals of environmental regulations will further harm the health of communities like hers that are already reeling from the effects of climate change. Shelby County, home to Memphis, recently received an F on the American Lung Association's annual report card for having so many high ozone days. Gonz\u00e1lez Whitaker is director of EcoMadres, a program within the national organization Moms for Clean Air that advocates for better environmental conditions for Latino communities.",
      "\"Urgent asthma needs in communities are getting defunded at a time when I just see things getting worse in terms of deregulation,\" said Gonz\u00e1lez Whitaker, who took her 12-year-old son to the hospital because of breathing issues for the first time this year. \"We're being assaulted by this data and science, which is clearly stating that we need to be doing better around preserving the regulations.\"",
      "Back in California's Imperial Valley \u2014 where the majority-Hispanic, working-class population surrounds California's largest lake, the Salton Sea \u2014 is an area called Bombay Beach. Bejarano calls it the \"forgotten community.\" Homes there lack clean running water, because of naturally occurring arsenic in the groundwater, and residents frequently experience a smell like rotten eggs blowing off the drying lakebed, exposing decades of pesticide-tinged dirt.",
      "In 2022, a 12-year-old girl died in Bombay Beach after an asthma attack. Bejarano said she later learned that the girl's school had recommended that she take part in Comite Civico del Valle's at-home asthma education program. She said the girl was on the waiting list when she died.",
      "\"It hit home. Her death showed the personal need we have here in Imperial County,\" Bejarano said. \"Deaths are preventable. Asthma is reversible. If you have asthma, you should be able to live a healthy life.\"",

    "summary": "A \"sneaky\" invasive species that has a potentially deadly sting can be found in more than a dozen states, according to experts.",
    "story": [
      "The Joro spider, Asian long-horned beetle and spotted lanternfly have company this summer.",
      "A \"sneaky\" invasive species that has a potentially deadly sting continues to spread across the U.S. and can be found in more than a dozen states, according to experts.",
      "Asian needle ants were first detected in the U.S. almost a century ago, but the species has continued to expand its reach, primarily throughout the Southeast, and this pest could potentially be deadly to humans, according to Dan Suiter, a professor of urban entomology at the University of Georgia.",
      "\"It injects venom that can harm you. Its sting can be life threatening,\" Suiter recently told the university.",
      "Suiter added that people who have adverse reactions to bee and ant stings are especially vulnerable and could go into anaphylactic shock from the needle ant's sting. Anaphylaxis is a potentially life-threatening allergic reaction that can occur within seconds of being exposed to something you're allergic to, such as a sting, according to the Mayo Clinic.",
      "\"If you suffer from anaphylaxis, you should really know what this ant looks like,\" Suiter says. \"And it might be smart to carry an EpiPen.\"",
      "Suiter urged people to be vigilant for these invasive species, especially with ant populations peaking later this summer.",
      "What are Asian needle ants?",
      "Asian needle ants are technically known as Brachyponera chinensis\u00a0\u2014 roughly translated as \"short, wicked ant from China\" \u2014 but their native range also includes Japan and the Koreas, according to the U.S. Forest Service.",
      "The insect was first discovered in the U.S. in 1932 in Georgia, but has only recently started to \"cause problems in North America after being relatively unnoticed for many years,\" the U.S. Forest Service says.",
      "The pest has now been detected all the way from Washington state to Florida, according to the site\u00a0antmaps.org as well as Mississippi State University, and the ant is recently getting more attention in Texas.",
      "Suiter says Asian needle ants are \"sneaky\" because they are less than a quarter of an inch long and are adept at hiding.",
      "\"Unlike many invasive species that tend to colonize areas in the wake of natural or human disturbance, Asian needle ants are capable of invading undisturbed forest areas where they nest under and within logs and other debris, under stones, and in leaf litter,\" the U.S. Forest Service says.",
      "Environmental impacts",
      "According to Suiter, Asian needle ants wreak havoc in native environments.",
      "\"They outcompete other ant species that are important to the ecology of that area,\" he says.",
      "Asian needle ants prey on other insects and are capable of displacing ant species that are critical for seed dispersal, according to the U.S. Forest Service. Researchers have documented large decreases in seed dispersal in forests where Asian needle ants are present.",
      "\"Thus, this invasive species could have dramatic, long-term negative effects on forest understory,\" the service says.",
      "What should people do if they see Asian needle ants?",
      "Asian needle ants are about 0.2 inches in length, and dark brown or black with the end of the antennae and the legs being a lighter orange-brown, the U.S. Forest Service says. Other ant species can look similar, \"so it takes an experienced eye to positively identify them,\" the service says.",
      "Suiter says that you can send a photograph or a specimen to a local University of Georgia Extension office, which can help with identification. The public can also contact a professional to come out and bait for the ants, he says.",
      "The U.S. Forest Service advises people to avoid the pest and to be especially vigilant in areas with logs and rotting or rocks were the ants can nest.",
      "\"Unfortunately, as with many invasive species, it appears Asian needle ants are here to stay,\" the service says.",

    "story": [
      "Four-and-a-half months after launch atop a Falcon 9 rocket, a privately-built Japanese lander attempted to touch down on the moon Thursday, but telemetry indicated a higher-than-expected descent velocity moments before communications were lost. The data suggested a mission-ending crash landing.",
      "\"Based on the currently available data, the Mission Control Center has been able to confirm the following: The laser rangefinder used to measure the distance to the lunar surface experienced delays in obtaining valid measurement values,\" ispace, builder of the Resilience lander, said in a statement.",
      "\"As a result, the lander was unable to decelerate sufficiently to reach the required speed for the planned lunar landing. Based on these circumstances, it is currently assumed that the lander likely performed a hard landing on the lunar surface.\"",
      "After unsuccessful attempts to re-establish communications, flight controllers in Tokyo uplinked commands to reboot the Resilience lander's flight computer. But there was no response.",
      "\"Given that there is currently no prospect of a successful lunar landing, our top priority is to swiftly analyze the telemetry data we have obtained thus far and work diligently to identify the cause,\" said ispace founder and CEO Takeshi Hakamada.",
      "\"We will strive to restore trust by providing a report of the findings to our shareholders, payload customers, (mission) partners, government officials and all supporters of ispace.\"",
      "The landing attempt came two years after ispace's first lander malfunctioned during the final stages of its descent to the moon, making a similar hard landing. But Hakamada said it was too early to establish any common cause and that engineers needed more time to analyze the telemetry that made it back to Earth.",
      "Carrying cameras, a few science payloads, a tiny rover and even an art project, Resilience   fired its thrusters just after 2:10 p.m. EDT to begin the 66-minute descent from a 62-mile-high circular orbit to touchdown near the center of Mare Frigoris \u2014 the Sea of Cold \u2014 in the moon's northern hemisphere at 60 degrees north latitude.",
      "All appeared to be going smoothly when, around 3:17 p.m. \u2014 the projected landing time \u2014 telemetry suddenly ceased. The last data received indicated a higher-than-expected descent velocity and an altitude of 630 feet above the surface.",
      "\"At this moment, we have not yet been able to establish communication with Resilience, but ispace engineers in our Mission Control Center are continuing to work to contact the lander,\" the company posted on X just after 5 p.m.",
      "\"We will share an update with the latest information in a media announcement in the next few hours. Thank you for your patience -- please check back with us soon.\" Three hours later, officials announced the landing failure during a news briefing.",
      "The primary goals of the mission were to land on the moon and deploy the small micro rover Tenacious. The rover, in turn, carried the art project, a tiny model of a Swedish house, designed by artist Mikael Genberg. The traditionally styled red-and-white house measures just 4.7 inches long, 4 inches high and weighs just 3.5 ounces.",

    "summary": "Two Chinese researchers were charged with trying to smuggle strains of a fungus called Fusarium graminearum into the U.S.",
    "story": [
      "The fungus labeled a \"potential agroterrorism weapon\" in a recent arrest touted by the Trump administration likely originated in North America and is already widely prevalent around the country, a researcher who studied the fungus for the federal government says.",
      "University of Michigan researcher Yunqing Jian and her boyfriend, Zunyong Liu, were charged with trying to smuggle strains of a fungus called Fusarium graminearum into the United States. Jian worked at the University of Michigan, according to officials, and Liu works at a Chinese university. The two have co-authored research into the fungus.",
      "\"I can confirm that the FBI arrested a Chinese national within the United States who allegedly smuggled a dangerous biological pathogen into the country,\" FBI Director Kash Patel said Tuesday in a post\u00a0on X.",
      "According to charging documents in the case, Liu told customs officers he was trying to continue his research with the strains at the University of Michigan lab that Jian worked in, skirting the rules that require paperwork and safeguards to safely import fungi for studies.",
      "F. graminearum is already widely prevalent across the U.S. in native grasses around the country as well as crops, scientists say. It spreads and thrives usually during wet weather, causing a common crop disease called Fusarium head blight or head scab, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Agricultural Research Service.",
      "\"It's extremely prevalent in North America. It likely arose in North America, so it's not like a foreign agent coming in. And it's already causing a lot of problems in U.S. agriculture,\" Harold Kistler, an adjunct professor at the University of Minnesota, told CBS News.",
      "Kistler said scientists believe F. graminearum likely originated in North America because all of its closest relatives have been found on the continent.",
      "\"Graminearum itself is distributed worldwide, and likely because of the distribution of grain from North America worldwide,\" he said.",
      "Kistler previously worked as a researcher for the USDA's Agricultural Research Service, studying fungi like F. graminearum and the crop disease it causes. While at the agency, he co-authored research with Liu and Jian uncovering new molecular clues to how the disease might be mitigated.",
      "\"It's a real problem. The problem is because there's no naturally occurring resistance to the disease. And people have been trying for decades to find resistance. It's just a tough nut to crack,\" Kistler said of the head blight caused by F. graminearum.",
      "Farmers in the U.S. rely on a number of methods to mitigate the risk of F. graminearum, including the use of fungicides, though scientists have worried about the possibility of mutations that could make the fungicides less effective.",
      "\"The fungicides are not cheap. So it's extra cost to farmers. But it's worth it because, without it, their crops could be completely lost. Not only due to yield reduction, but because what grain they may have would be contaminated with these toxins,\" Kistler said.",
      "Billions of dollars were lost to epidemics caused by the fungus in the 1990s, researchers and agriculture officials estimate. The Food and Drug Administration monitors for the toxins that are produced by fungi like F. graminearum, including deoxynivalenol, also called vomitoxin or DON, which can cause vomiting and diarrhea in humans who ingest too much of it.",
      "\"It is not possible to completely avoid the presence of DON in wheat. DON is sometimes found in wheat grown under normal weather conditions, however, the fungus thrives in cool, wet conditions,\" the FDA said in a 2010 advisory to states and grain groups.",
      "Kistler said U.S. distributors also test grain for the presence of the toxins to prevent there being too much of it in the food supply.",
      "\"If it's too high, they will reject it. They won't buy it. Or they will reduce the amount that they'll pay for it. If it's just marginal, they can blend it with grain that doesn't have the toxin to get below the limit of what's considered safe,\" he said.",

    "summary": "It had not been thought possible that such tiny, weak stars could provide the conditions needed to form and host huge planets.",
    "story": [
      "Astronomers announced Wednesday they have discovered a massive planet orbiting a tiny star, a bizarre pairing that has stumped scientists.",
      "Most of the stars across the Milky Way are small red dwarfs like TOI-6894, which has only 20% the mass of our sun.",
      "It had not been thought possible that such puny, weak stars could provide the conditions needed to form and host huge planets.",
      "But an international team of astronomers have detected the unmistakable signature of a gas giant planet orbiting the undersized TOI-6894, according to a study in the journal Nature Astronomy. This makes the star the smallest star yet known to host a gas giant.",
      "The planet has a slightly larger radius than Saturn, but only half its mass. It orbits its star in a little over three days.",
      "The astronomers discovered the planet when searching through more than 91,000 low-mass red dwarfs observed by NASA's TESS space telescope. Its existence was then confirmed by ground-based telescopes, including Chile's Very Large Telescope.",
      "\"The fact that this star hosts a giant planet has big implications for the total number of giant planets we estimate exist in our galaxy,\" study co-author Daniel Bayliss of the UK's Warwick University said in a statement.",
      "Another co-author, Vincent Van Eylen, of University College London, said it was an \"intriguing discovery.\"",
      "\"We don't really understand how a star with so little mass can form such a massive planet!\" he said. \"This is one of the goals of the search for more exoplanets. By finding planetary systems different from our solar system, we can test our models and better understand how our own solar system formed.\"",
      "Planet is unusually cold",
      "The most prominent theory for how planets form is called core accretion.",
      "The process begins when a ring of gas and dust \u2014 called a protoplanetary disc \u2014 which surrounds a newly formed star builds up into a planetary core. This core attracts more gas that forms an atmosphere, eventually snowballing into a gas giant.",
      "Under this theory, it is difficult for low-mass stars to host giant planets because there is not enough gas and dust to begin building a core in the first place.",
      "A rival theory proposes that these planets instead form when their protoplanetary disc becomes gravitationally unstable and breaks up, with the collapsing gas and dust forming a planet.",
      "However neither theory seems to explain the existence of the newly discovered planet, TOI-6894b, the researchers said.",
      "The planet also interests scientists because it is strangely cold.",
      "Most of the gas giants discovered outside our solar system so far have been what are known as \"hot Jupiters,\" where temperatures soar well over 1,000 degrees Celsius. But the newly discovered planet appears to be under 150C, the researchers said.",
      "\"Temperatures are low enough that atmospheric observations could even show us ammonia, which would be the first time it is found in an exoplanet atmosphere,\" said study co-author Amaury Triaud of Birmingham University.",
      "The James Webb space telescope is scheduled to turn its powerful gaze toward the planet in the next year, which could help uncover some more mysteries of this strange planet.",
      "Recent cosmic discoveries",
      "The spotting of the giant planet orbiting the undersized star marks the latest in a string of recent celestial discoveries.",
      "Last month, a U.S.-based trio hunting the elusive \"Planet Nine\" said they instead stumbled on what appears to be a new dwarf planet in the solar system's outer reaches. Named 2017 OF201, the new object is roughly 430 miles across, according to a preprint study, making it three times smaller than Pluto.",
      "Also in May, an international team reported that a newly found celestial object \u2014 perhaps a star, pair of stars or something else entirely \u2014 is emitting X-rays around the same time it's shooting out radio waves.",
      "Meanwhile, scientists announced recently that a new planetarium show about the Milky Way helped them unlock one of the solar system's many secrets. Experts at the American Museum of Natural History in New York were fine-tuning a scene about the Oort Cloud that's far beyond Pluto. Scientists have never glimpsed this region, but when museum experts projected their scene onto the planetarium dome, created using simulation data, they saw a spiral shape.",
      "Scientists had long thought the Oort Cloud was shaped like a sphere or flattened shell, warped by the push and pull of other planets and the Milky Way itself. The planetarium show hinted that a more complex shape could lie inside.",

      "\"It's kind of a freak accident that it actually happened,\" said David Nesvorny with the Southwest Research Institute.",

      "The discovery, relying on data on how celestial objects move and using simulations, will be difficult to confirm with observations. But knowing more about the orbits of distant comets could give scientists some clues, Izidoro said.",
      "While putting together the planetarium show, the museum's experts weren't expecting a window into the universe's inner workings. The show features many vivid scenes that may capture audiences more than the Oort Cloud, said the museum's Jon Parker, including an ongoing merge of the Sagittarius mini galaxy with the Milky Way.",
      "No matter how striking and beautiful the visuals of the show, the museum was committed to making it scientifically accurate. That's what created the perfect conditions to stumble upon something new, said the museum's Carter Emmart.",
      "\"You just never know what you're going to find,\" Emmart said.",
      "According to the planetarium, \"Encounters in the Milky Way\" \u2014 narrated by actor Pedro Pascal \u2014 is a \"a time-traveling journey about the cosmic movements that shape our galactic neighborhood.\"",

    "story": [
      "Smoke from wildfires in Canada has drifted into the U.S., prompting air quality alerts for Americans as it continues to spread.",
      "But when officials and forecasters classify a city's air as \"unhealthy\" or \"hazardous,\" what does that really mean? The classifications are based on a federal measurement system called the Air Quality Index.",
      "What is the Air Quality Index?",
      "The Air Quality Index is used nationwide to measure the severity of air pollution and categorize the health risks that are involved with various levels of pollution. The index uses six color-coded categories: good (green), moderate (yellow), unhealthy for sensitive groups (orange), unhealthy (red), very unhealthy (purple) and hazardous (maroon).",
      "The health impacts included in the index are those that people are likely to experience within \"a few hours or days\" after being exposed to the air, the National Weather Service Says.",
      "How is air quality measured?",
      "The National Weather Service says that the Environmental Protection Agency calculates the Air Quality Index \u2014 a value between 0 and 500 \u2014 based on five \"major pollutants.\"",
      "Those pollutants \u2014 ground-level ozone, particulate matter, carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide \u2014 are all regulated by the Clean Air Act. Of those, ground-level ozone and airborne particles are considered \"the greatest threat to human health.\"",
      "What do the numbers mean?",
      "Each Air Quality Index category, also known as the level of concern, is attached to a certain range of values:",
      "Good (green): 0 to 50Moderate (yellow): 51 to 100Unhealthy for sensitive groups (orange): 101 to 150Unhealthy (red): 151 to 200\u00a0Very unhealthy (purple): 201 to 300\u00a0Hazardous (marron): 301 and higher",

      "Very unhealthy (purple): 201 to 300",
      "Hazardous (marron): 301 and higher",
      "Essentially, the lower the number, the cleaner the air. The only category where air quality is considered \"satisfactory\" is the one where the index value is no more than 50, although values between 51 and 100 are still considered \"acceptable.\" After that, the air could pose a risk to at least some people, and that risk only becomes greater as the index value rises.",
      "Once the air is deemed \"very unhealthy,\" the general public is at risk of experiencing health impacts, which range from a headache and fatigue to much more serious issues such as heart attack or stroke. At \"hazardous\" levels, the region is experiencing an air quality emergency. Those with chronic respiratory or cardiovascular conditions are more at risk of developing serious health issues as pollution worsens.",
      "What is the air quality near me?",
      "Air Quality Index values change constantly throughout the day as weather conditions and weather patterns move through the area. The map below automatically updates to show air quality conditions nationwide.",
      "The EPA's\u00a0AirNow.gov site uses the index to provide the latest status for your area. To use the site, enter your ZIP code and a meter will pop up showing you what the value and color category is for your city, as well as the last time that measurement was updated.",
      "It also tells you what pollutant is causing issues, who is most at risk for health complications and what activities may be safe to do.",
      "In Minneapolis, for example, the reading on Tuesday morning, June 3, said the AQI for PM2.5, a kind of particulate matter, is 203, meaning \"very unhealthy,\" and that people who have heart or lung disease, those who are elderly, and children and teens should avoid outdoor physical activity.

      "Four-and-a-half months after launch atop a Falcon 9 rocket, a privately-built Japanese lander attempted to touch down on the moon Thursday, but telemetry indicated a higher-than-expected descent velocity moments before communications were lost.

    "summary": "It had not been thought possible that such tiny, weak stars could provide the conditions needed to form and host huge planets.",
    "story": [
      "Astronomers announced Wednesday they have discovered a massive planet orbiting a tiny star, a bizarre pairing that has stumped scientists.",
      "Most of the stars across the Milky Way are small red dwarfs like TOI-6894, which has only 20% the mass of our sun.",
      "It had not been thought possible that such puny, weak stars could provide the conditions needed to form and host huge planets.",
      "But an international team of astronomers have detected the unmistakable signature of a gas giant planet orbiting the undersized TOI-6894, according to a study in the journal Nature Astronomy. This makes the star the smallest star yet known to host a gas giant.",
      "The planet has a slightly larger radius than Saturn, but only half its mass. It orbits its star in a little over three days.",
      "The astronomers discovered the planet when searching through more than 91,000 low-mass red dwarfs observed by NASA's TESS space telescope. Its existence was then confirmed by ground-based telescopes, including Chile's Very Large Telescope.",
      "\"The fact that this star hosts a giant planet has big implications for the total number of giant planets we estimate exist in our galaxy,\" study co-author Daniel Bayliss of the UK's Warwick University said in a statement.",
      "Another co-author, Vincent Van Eylen, of University College London, said it was an \"intriguing discovery.\"",
      "\"We don't really understand how a star with so little mass can form such a massive planet!\" he said. \"This is one of the goals of the search for more exoplanets. By finding planetary systems different from our solar system, we can test our models and better understand how our own solar system formed.\"",
      "Planet is unusually cold",
      "The most prominent theory for how planets form is called core accretion.",
      "The process begins when a ring of gas and dust \u2014 called a protoplanetary disc \u2014 which surrounds a newly formed star builds up into a planetary core. This core attracts more gas that forms an atmosphere, eventually snowballing into a gas giant.",
      "Under this theory, it is difficult for low-mass stars to host giant planets because there is not enough gas and dust to begin building a core in the first place.",
      "A rival theory proposes that these planets instead form when their protoplanetary disc becomes gravitationally unstable and breaks up, with the collapsing gas and dust forming a planet.",
      "However neither theory seems to explain the existence of the newly discovered planet, TOI-6894b, the researchers said.",
      "The planet also interests scientists because it is strangely cold.",
      "Most of the gas giants discovered outside our solar system so far have been what are known as \"hot Jupiters,\" where temperatures soar well over 1,000 degrees Celsius. But the newly discovered planet appears to be under 150C, the researchers said.",
      "\"Temperatures are low enough that atmospheric observations could even show us ammonia, which would be the first time it is found in an exoplanet atmosphere,\" said study co-author Amaury Triaud of Birmingham University.",
      "The James Webb space telescope is scheduled to turn its powerful gaze toward the planet in the next year, which could help uncover some more mysteries of this strange planet.",
      "Recent cosmic discoveries",
      "The spotting of the giant planet orbiting the undersized star marks the latest in a string of recent celestial discoveries.",
      "Last month, a U.S.-based trio hunting the elusive \"Planet Nine\" said they instead stumbled on what appears to be a new dwarf planet in the solar system's outer reaches. Named 2017 OF201, the new object is roughly 430 miles across, according to a preprint study, making it three times smaller than Pluto.",
      "Also in May, an international team reported that a newly found celestial object \u2014 perhaps a star, pair of stars or something else entirely \u2014 is emitting X-rays around the same time it's shooting out radio waves.",
      "Meanwhile, scientists announced recently that a new planetarium show about the Milky Way helped them unlock one of the solar system's many secrets. Experts at the American Museum of Natural History in New York were fine-tuning a scene about the Oort Cloud that's far beyond Pluto. Scientists have never glimpsed this region, but when museum experts projected their scene onto the planetarium dome, created using simulation data, they saw a spiral shape.",
      "Scientists had long thought the Oort Cloud was shaped like a sphere or flattened shell, warped by the push and pull of other planets and the Milky Way itself. The planetarium show hinted that a more complex shape could lie inside.",

      "They were fine-tuning a scene featuring what's known as the Oort Cloud, a region far beyond Pluto filled with icy relics from the solar system's formation. Comets can hurtle toward Earth from the cloud, but scientists have never glimpsed its true shape.",
      "One evening while watching the Oort Cloud scene, scientists noticed something strange projected onto the planetarium's dome.",
      "\"Why is there a spiral there?\" said Jackie Faherty, an astrophysicist who leads the museum's educational programs and helped put together the planetarium show.",
      "The inner section of the Oort Cloud, made of billions of comets, resembled a bar with two waving arms, similar to the shape of our Milky Way galaxy.",
      "Scientists had long thought the Oort Cloud was shaped like a sphere or flattened shell, warped by the push and pull of other planets and the Milky Way itself. The planetarium show hinted that a more complex shape could lie inside.",
      "The museum contacted the researcher who provided the Oort Cloud data for the show, who was also surprised to see the spiral.",
      "\"It's kind of a freak accident that it actually happened,\" said David Nesvorny with the Southwest Research Institute.",
      "Realizing they'd stumbled on something new, the researchers published their findings earlier this year in The Astrophysical Journal.",
      "The spiral is \"a striking shift in our understanding of the outer solar system,\" planetary scientist Andre Izidoro with Rice University, who was not involved with the study, said in an email.",
      "The discovery, relying on data on how celestial objects move and using simulations, will be difficult to confirm with observations. But knowing more about the orbits of distant comets could give scientists some clues, Izidoro said.",
      "While putting together the planetarium show, the museum's experts weren't expecting a window into the universe's inner workings. The show features many vivid scenes that may capture audiences more than the Oort Cloud, said the museum's Jon Parker, including an ongoing merge of the Sagittarius mini galaxy with the Milky Way.",
      "No matter how striking and beautiful the visuals of the show, the museum was committed to making it scientifically accurate. That's what created the perfect conditions to stumble upon something new, said the museum's Carter Emmart.",
      "\"You just never know what you're going to find,\" Emmart said.",
      "According to the planetarium, \"Encounters in the Milky Way\" \u2014 narrated by actor Pedro Pascal \u2014 is a \"a time-traveling journey about the cosmic movements that shape our galactic neighborhood.\"",
      "The film, a collaboration of astronomers and science visualization experts, pulls from data from the European Space Agency's Gaia mission. The mission is called the \"billion-star survey\" as it aims to map the precise positions and motions of nearly 2 billion stars in our galaxy.",

This year's event, which starts Monday with a keynote address from CEO Tim Cook and runs through to June 13, is expected to attract thousands of developers and virtual attendees, all eager to see what the tech giant has on tap for the coming year.",
      "Apple did not respond to CBS MoneyWatch's request for comment. The company is expected to announce updates to its mobile operating system and to Apple Intelligence, which analysts say has lagged behind competitors' AI offerings.",
      "What new features is Apple expected to roll out?",
      "Although analysts don't expect any blockbuster reveals from Apple this week, they are looking for refinements in Apple Intelligence, the AI features offered on the iPhone, iPad and other devices. Apple announced new AI integrations for Siri at last year's conference, but the full suite of upgrades for the voice assistant have yet to take effect.",
      "\"It's just taking a bit longer than we thought,\" Apple CEO Tim Cook said in a call with Wall Street analysts. \"But we are making progress, and we're extremely excited to get the more personal Siri features out there.\"",
      "In a research note, Wedbush tech analyst Dan Ives noted that the Apple Intelligence rollout has been slower than expected, but also estimates that over the next few years, 25% of the world population will access AI through an Apple-powered device. At this week's event, Apple is likely to provide updates on Siri's integration with two major AI platforms, Google's Gemini and OpenAI's ChatGPT, according to Ives.",
      "Apple is also expected announce a new \u2014 and more straightforward \u2014 nomenclature for its operating system. For example, rather than iOS 19, the operating system introduced in 2025 would be called iOS 26 to align with the coming year. The latest iOS is slated to be released as a free update in September.",

    "story": [
      "New college graduates this year face an especially daunting task \u2014 putting their degrees to work just as \"generative\" artificial intelligence technology like ChatGPT is beginning to change the American workplace.",
      "\"We are entering an entirely new economy, so the knowledge economy that we have been in for the last 50 years or so is on the way out, and a new economy is on the way in,\" Aneesh Raman, Chief Economic Opportunity Officer at LinkedIn, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "The impact of AI on Americans recently out of college is already visible across a range of industries and jobs, from technology and finance to media, legal fields and market research. As a result, for the first time\u00a0unemployment among fresh grads recently surpassed the nation's overall jobless rate \u2014 a shift some experts attribute in part to the creeping influence of AI.",
      "\"There are signs that entry-level positions are being displaced by artificial intelligence at higher rates than the roles above them,\" said Matthew Martin, senior U.S. economist at Oxford Economics.",
      "With the adoption of AI at work only expected to accelerate, we asked three experts across academia, recruitment and consulting for advice on how new college grads should navigate this new normal. Here's what they said.",
      "Become fluent in AI",
      "Perhaps most important, young job-seekers start using gen-AI tools \u2014 today.",
      "\"Almost anybody in that audience, irrespective of the job that they're pursuing, will be expected to use AI with some facility right away,\" said Joseph Fuller, a professor at Harvard Business School and founder of the Managing the Future of Work\u00a0project, comparing the task to learning how to use Microsoft Office for a previous generation of grads.",
      "To get the ball rolling, experts encourage those who are starting to hunt for work to familiarize themselves with the array of tools at their disposal, such as Anthropic's Claude or OpenAI's ChatGPT. That means learning how to engage with such tools beyond simply using them as a search engine.",
      "\"You want to get in a dialogue with it,\" Fuller said. \"You want to ask it to take different perspectives.\"",
      "Emily Rose McRae, an analyst at research and advisory firm Gartner, said learning how to use AI apps can also be a good way to develop transferable skills. For example, asking AI to summarize documents and then validating its findings to ensure accuracy.",
      "Meanwhile, although AI can be helpful when it comes time to filling out job applications, users should proceed with caution given that recruiters can often spot AI-generated language, experts note. Nearly two-thirds of job candidates today use AI at some point in the application process, according to a\u00a0report from recruitment firm Career Group Companies.",
      "\"If you're using it to write your cover letter and your resume and you did not review it, everyone can tell,\" McRae said.",
      "Another way to gain potentially valuable experience with AI, while also seeking work, is for interview practice. For example, users can ask the chatbot both to provide sample questions they might face in an interview and then rate the quality of their responses.",
      "\"If you are using it as a tool to get your own understanding of self in interviews, you're going to start being leaps ahead of everyone else,\" Raman said.",
      "Hone your soft skills",
      "Experts say that as AI surpasses humans in executing certain tasks \u2014 think actuarial math or corporate compliance, for example \u2014more attention will shift to job candidates' so-called soft skills, such as problem solving and communication.",
      "\"You cannot outsource your thinking to AI,\" LinkedIn's Raman said. \"You have to continue to hone critical thinking and complex strategy thinking.\"",
      "The focus will be less on your pedigree \u2014 where you went to school or even whether you have a college degree \u2014 he added, and more on what he calls the \"5 Cs\": curiosity, compassion, creativity, courage and communication.",
      "To improve their soft skills, Fuller encourages entry-level job candidates to work on turning what they regard as their biggest weakness into a strength. For instance, if you typically shy away from public speaking or talking in groups, push yourself to get comfortable in those situations.",
      "\"The inability to do that is going to be penalized more severely in the work of the future than it has been in the past,\" he said.",
      "The Harvard professor also suggested highlighting examples of advanced social skills directly on your resume to help paint a picture for recruiters of how you can contribute to the workplace.",
      "Choose your employer wisely",
      "Beyond skills development, experts say college grads should be thoughtful about the type of company they choose to work at, knowing that AI could drastically alter the business in the coming years.",
      "\"The most important thing, if you're a new grad, is where you work \u2014 not what you do at the place you're going to work,\" Raman told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "He encouraged college graduates to seek out employers that are integrating AI responsibly and with respect for their workforce \u2014 as opposed to embracing it chiefly to replace people. Companies that are adapting to what is a major technological shift in real time will typically offer the best opportunities for learning and growth, Fuller said.",
      "In evaluating a prospective employer, young job candidates should try to gain an understanding of how they fit into the company's future. For example, McRae recommends asking hiring managers up front what types of investments the organization is making in its employees and what the room for growth looks like.",
      "\"What are they telling me they care about? What do career paths look like for this role like now? How do you help people develop the skills they need to become experts?\" she said.",
      "In researching companies, McRae also encouraged recent college grads to look for places that offer apprenticeship or rotational programs, which can offer ways to quickly ramp up their knowledge base, especially if traditional entry-level roles are in short supply.",

      "CBS News uncovered dozens of those ads on Meta's Instagram platform, in its \"Stories\" feature, promoting AI tools that, in many cases, advertised the ability to \"upload a photo\" and \"see anyone naked.\" Other ads in Instagram's Stories promoted the ability to upload and manipulate videos of real people. One promotional ad even read \"how is this filter even allowed?\" as text underneath an example of a nude deepfake.",
      "One ad promoted its AI product by using highly sexualized, underwear-clad deepfake images of actors Scarlett Johansson and Anne Hathaway. Some of the ads' URL links redirect to websites that promote the ability to animate real people's images and get them to perform sex acts. And some of the applications charged users between $20 and $80 to access these \"exclusive\" and \"advance\" features. In other cases, an ad's URL redirected users to Apple's app store, where \"nudify\" apps were available to download.",
      "An analysis of the advertisements in Meta's ad library found that there were, at a minimum, hundreds of these ads available across the company's social media platforms, including on Facebook, Instagram, Threads, the Facebook Messenger application and Meta Audience Network \u2014 a platform that allows Meta advertisers to reach users on mobile apps and websites that partner with the company.",
      "According to Meta's own Ad Library data, many of these ads were specifically targeted at men between the ages of 18 and 65, and were active in the United States, European Union and United Kingdom.",
      "A Meta spokesperson told CBS News the spread of this sort of AI-generated content is an ongoing problem and they are facing increasingly sophisticated challenges in trying to combat it.",
      "\"The people behind these exploitative apps constantly evolve their tactics to evade detection, so we're continuously working to strengthen our enforcement,\" a Meta spokesperson said.",
      "CBS News found that ads for \"nudify\" deepfake tools were still available on the company's Instagram platform even after Meta had removed those initially flagged.",
      "Deepfakes are manipulated images, audio recordings, or videos of real people that have been altered with artificial intelligence to misrepresent someone as saying or doing something that the person did not actually say or do.",
      "Last month, President Trump signed into law the bipartisan \"Take It Down Act,\" which, among other things, requires websites and social media companies to remove deepfake content within 48 hours of notice from a victim.",
      "Although the law makes it illegal to \"knowingly publish\" or threaten to publish intimate images without a person's consent, including AI-created deepfakes, it does not target the tools used to create such AI-generated content.",
      "Those tools do violate platform safety and moderation rules implemented by both Apple and Meta on their respective platforms.",
      "Meta's advertising standards policy says, \"ads must not contain adult nudity and sexual activity. This includes nudity, depictions of people in explicit or sexually suggestive positions, or activities that are sexually suggestive.\"",
      "Under Meta's \"bullying and harassment\" policy, the company also prohibits \"derogatory sexualized photoshop or drawings\" on its platforms. The company says its regulations are intended to block users from sharing or threatening to share nonconsensual intimate imagery.",
      "Apple's guidelines for its app store explicitly state that \"content that is offensive, insensitive, upsetting, intended to disgust, in exceptionally poor taste, or just plain creepy\" is banned.",
      "Alexios Mantzarlis, director of the Security, Trust, and Safety Initiative at Cornell University's tech research center, has been studying the surge in AI deepfake networks marketing on social platforms for more than a year. He told CBS News in a phone interview on Tuesday that he'd seen thousands more of these ads across Meta platforms, as well as on platforms such as X and Telegram, during that period.",
      "Although Telegram and X have what he described as a structural \"lawlessness\" that allows for this sort of content, he believes Meta's leadership lacks the will to address the issue, despite having content moderators in place.",
      "\"I do think that trust and safety teams at these companies care. I don't think, frankly, that they care at the very top of the company in Meta's case,\" he said. \"They're clearly under-resourcing the teams that have to fight this stuff, because as sophisticated as these [deepfake] networks are \u2026 they don't have Meta money to throw at it.\"",
      "Mantzarlis also said that he found in his research that \"nudify\" deepfake generators are available to download on both Apple's app store and Google's Play store, expressing frustration with these massive platforms' inability to enforce such content.",
      "\"The problem with apps is that they have this dual-use front where they present on the app store as a fun way to face swap, but then they are marketing on Meta as their primary purpose being nudification. So when these apps come up for review on the Apple or Google store, they don't necessarily have the wherewithal to ban them,\" he said.",
      "\"There needs to be cross-industry cooperation where if the app or the website markets itself as a tool for nudification on any place on the web, then everyone else can be like, 'All right, I don't care what you present yourself as on my platform, you're gone,'\" Mantzarlis added.",
      "CBS News has reached out to both Apple and Google for comment as to how they moderate their respective platforms. Neither company had responded by the time of writing.",
      "Major tech companies' promotion of such apps raises serious questions about both user consent and about online safety for minors. A CBS News analysis of one \"nudify\" website promoted on Instagram showed that the site did not prompt any form of age verification prior to a user uploading a photo to generate a deepfake image.",
      "Such issues are widespread. In December, CBS News' 60 Minutes reported on the lack of age verification on one of the most popular sites using artificial intelligence to generate fake nude photos of real people.",
      "Despite visitors being told that they must be 18 or older to use the site, and that \"processing of minors is impossible,\" 60 Minutes was able to immediately gain access to uploading photos once the user clicked \"accept\" on the age warning prompt, with no other age verification necessary.",
      "Data also shows that a high percentage of underage teenagers have interacted with deepfake content. A March 2025 study conducted by the children's protection nonprofit Thorn showed that among teens, 41% said they had heard of the term \"deepfake nudes,\" while 10% reported personally knowing someone who had had deepfake nude imagery created of them.",

      "The twin-engine Cessna 414 crashed at around 12:30 p.m. Sunday, not long after it took off, the FAA said. The plane was returning to Phoenix one day after flying out from Arizona, according to the flight tracking website Flightaware.com.",
      "Searchers found a debris field later Sunday about 5 miles off the coast of Point Loma, a San Diego neighborhood that juts into the Pacific, U.S. Coast Guard officials said. The water in the search area is about 200 feet deep.",
      "Although the FAA said all six people on board the plane were killed, authorities haven't identified them.",
      "The FAA said the plane is owned by vitamin and nutritional supplement maker Optimal Health Systems. But the company based in Pima, Arizona, said in a statement that it sold the plane to a group of private individuals in 2023, meaning the FAA database could be out of date.",
      "However, the company's founder, Doug Grant, said in the statement, \"We personally know several of the passengers onboard and our sincerest condolences are offered to those affected by the tragedy, all of whom are incredible members of our small community.\"",
      "The FAA referred questions about the plane's ownership to the National Transportation Safety Board, which didn't immediately provide any further details about the crash.",
      "San Diego Harbor Police assisted with sonar to help pinpoint the area of the crash, CBS affiliate KFMB-TV reported. The Coast Guard also alerted the San Diego Fire Department Lifeguards about the crash, and lifeguards were able to find an oil sheen and some debris on the water. Any debris initially recovered by lifeguards has been turned over to Coast Guard officials, the fire department said.",
      "The pilot told air traffic controllers that he was struggling to maintain his heading and climb as the plane twice turned toward shore before going back out to sea, according to audio posted by LiveATC.net and radar data posted by FlightAware. The controller urged the pilot to climb to 4,000 feet after he reported the plane was only about 1,000 feet in the air.",
      "The controller directed the pilot to land at a nearby U.S. naval airport on Coronado Island, but the pilot said he was unable to see the airport. A short time later, the pilot repeatedly signaled the \"Mayday\" distress call before controllers lost radar contact.",
      "A man who was out surfing when the plane crashed told NBC 7 in San Diego that he saw the plane come down at an angle, then climb back into the clouds before diving again and crashing into the water.",

      "\"President Trump's order calling federalized National Guard troops into Los Angeles \u2014 over the objections of the Governor and local law enforcement \u2014 is unnecessary and counterproductive.

      "The president's actions follow a series of travel bans issued during his first administration that initially targeted predominantly Muslim countries. Like those orders, his latest proclamation could be subject to lawsuits, although the Supreme Court ultimately upheld the revised ban from his first term, which the White House noted in a fact sheet outlining his second-term bans.",

    "story": [
      "Former Israeli Defense Minister and opposition lawmaker Avigdor Liberman on Thursday accused Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of authorizing weapons transfers to a criminal gang in Gaza that he likened to the ISIS terrorist group. Netanyahu appeared later in the day to confirm the operation, suggesting it would save the lives of Israeli forces battling Hamas in the Palestinian territory.",
      "\"They are receiving weapons from the state of Israel. It's a total madness,\" Liberman said in a radio interview. \"It's unclear to me who approved it.\"",
      "Liberman said the head of Israel's primary domestic intelligence agency Shin Bet was aware of the weapons transfers, \"but I'm not sure the [Israel Defense Forces] knows. We're talking about the equivalent of ISIS in Gaza. No one can guarantee that these weapons will not be directed at Israel. We have no way of monitoring or following.\"",
      "Liberman appeared to be referring to a militia called the Popular Forces of Palestine, led by Yasser Abu Shabab. The group is opposed to Hamas, the Israeli- and U.S.-designated terrorist group Israel has been at war with for more than a year and a half.",
      "Popular Forces is believed to be a relatively small armed group based in the southern Gaza city of Rafah. It has been accused of looting trucks trying to deliver aid to Gaza's starving population, which its leader reportedly denied.",
      "There have been reports that Shabab, the group's leader, was previously jailed by Hamas for smuggling drugs, as well as reports that his brother was killed by Hamas when the group cracked down on attacks on U.N. aid convoys",
      "Late on Thursday, Netanyahu acknowledged that \"on the advice of security officials, we activated clans in Gaza that oppose Hamas. What's wrong with that? It's only good. It only saves the lives of IDF soldiers.\"",
      "Abu Shabab denied receiving weapons from Israel in a statement posted on social media.",
      "\"We categorically reject these accusations and consider them a blatant attempt to distort the image of a grassroots force born from suffering \u2014 one that stood up to injustice, looting, and corruption,\" the group said. \"This desperate attempt to link us to the occupation is, in reality, an implicit admission that we have become a powerful and influential force.\"",
      "Hamas orchestrated and led the Oct. 7, 2023 terror attack on southern Israel that began the war in Gaza. It said, following Netanyahu's remarks, that \"every individual involved in these mercenary gangs [Israel has allegedly been supporting] is considered by us to be an Israeli soldier. We will deal with them with full force.\"",
      "Israeli opposition leader Yair Lapid responded to the claim that Israel is arming Abu Shabab with a warning that it could see a repeat of a grim history for the country.",
      "For decades, including multiple terms in office for Netanyahu, Israel allowed Hamas to grow and entrench its control in Gaza, with millions of dollars in support from the Arab would pouring in. It was seen as a cynical bid to prevent a unified Palestinian leadership from taking hold in Gaza and the much larger territory of the West Bank.",
      "\"After Netanyahu finished giving millions of dollars to Hamas, he moved on to giving weapons to organizations close to ISIS in Gaza, all off the cuff, all without strategic planning, all leading to more disasters,\" Lapid said on social media.",

    "summary": "President Donald Trump&apos;s administration faces legal pushback over migrant deportations to El Salvador, Mexico and South Sudan amid questions over due process.",
    "story": [
      "Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs Tricia McLaughlin sounded off on a Biden-appointed federal judge who could decide Wednesday morning that a plane carrying illegal immigrants convicted of serious crimes to South Sudan has to return.",
      "The Trump administration on Friday announced it had returned Kilmar Abrego Garcia \u2013 a Salvadoran migrant and alleged MS-13 member \u2013 to the U.S., months after he was deported to El Salvador in what officials later acknowledged was an administrative error.",
      "It is unclear whether Abrego Garcia\u2019s return signals a shift in policy or is merely a one-off. The administration paired the announcement with news of a new federal indictment charging him with crimes related to transporting undocumented immigrants in the U.S.",
      "Still, the case has sparked fresh questions about the administration\u2019s willingness to comply with other court orders requiring the return of deported migrants \u2013 whether individuals or entire classes \u2013 or mandating that certain individuals remain in U.S. custody long enough to challenge their removals to so-called \"third countries.\"",
      "It also undercut the Trump administration's assertion earlier this year that it is powerless to order El Salvador to return a prisoner or facilitate the return of migrants sent to El Salvador \u2013 something judges have attempted somewhat unsuccessfully to square in various court proceedings this year.",
      "Here is what to know about those cases so far.",

      "Vice President JD Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, and Attorney General Pam Bondi listen as President Donald Trump meets with El Salvador\u2019s President Nayib Bukele in the Oval Office on Apr. 14 to discuss issues including the detention of Kilmar Abrego Garcia. (Win McNamee/Getty Images)",
      "Daniel Lozano-Camargo, previously referred to in court documents as \"Cristian,\" is a 20-year-old Venezuelan immigrant deported in March under the Alien Enemies Act, a 1798 wartime law invoked by Trump to quickly remove hundreds of immigrants and send them to El Salvador to be detained in the country\u2019s maximum-security CECOT prison.",
      "U.S. District Judge Stephanie Gallagher\u00a0ruled in April that his deportation violated a settlement agreement that the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) stuck last year with a group of young asylum seekers, including Lozano-Camargo, who had entered the country as an unaccompanied child and later sought asylum.",
      "Under that agreement, DHS agreed not to deport the immigrants until their asylum cases were fully adjudicated in court, which she said had not happened in Lozano-Camargo\u2019s case prior to his removal.",
      "Gallagher, a Trump appointee, ruled that his deportation was a breach of contract. In ordering his return to the U.S., she stressed that her ruling had nothing to do with the strength of his asylum request in question \u2013 a nod to the two apparent low-level drug offenses he had racked up prior to his removal \u2013 but simply his ability to have his asylum request adjudicated in court under the agreement with DHS.",
      "The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit\u00a0upheld that decision late last month, clearing the way for Gallagher to set a formal timeline for the government to comply with facilitating the return. DHS officials told the court last week in a status update that Lozano-Camargo remains held at CECOT.",

      "Prisoners at CECOT are seen in a cell at the Salvadorian maximum-security detention facility on April 4, 2025. (Alex Pe\u00f1a/Getty Images)",
      "The Trump administration returned a mistakenly deported Guatemalan native to U.S. soil last week, marking the\u00a0first known instance of the Trump administration complying with a judge\u2019s orders to return an individual removed from the U.S. based on erroneous information.",
      "The immigrant, referred to in court documents only as \"O.C.G.,\" was deported to Mexico in March without due process and despite his stated fears of persecution in the country, according to U.S. District Judge Brian Murphy, who ordered his return.",
      "Murphy noted that O.C.G. had previously been held for ransom and\u00a0raped in Mexico but was not afforded the chance to assert those fears prior to his removal \u2013 a right afforded to him by U.S. and international law.",
      "ICE officials told the court earlier this month that they were working to secure his return. Last week, attorneys for O.C.G. told Fox News he had been returned to the U.S. on Wednesday via commercial flight.",
      "Unlike the individuals deported to CECOT, however, O.C.G. had not been detained in Mexico after he was deported, which could have eased some of the hurdles for the administration in returning him.",
      "The Trump administration relented for the first time last week and complied with a federal judge's order to return a deported migrant removed from the U.S. based on erroneous information. (Getty Images)",
      "Murphy ordered the Trump administration to keep in U.S. custody a group of six immigrants who were deported to South Sudan without due process or notice until they have the opportunity to conduct so-called \"reasonable fear interviews,\" or a chance to explain to U.S. officials any fear of persecution or torture, should they be released into South Sudanese custody.",
      "Currently, all six individuals remain detained at a U.S. military base in Djibouti \u2013 the only U.S. military base currently operational in all of Africa \u2013 and where ICE officials tasked with keeping them in custody cited recent health risks, including from malaria exposure, searing heat, nearby burn pits as well as the \"imminent danger\" of rocket attacks from terrorist groups in Yemen.",
      "In response, Murphy reiterated earlier this month that the individuals need not remain in South Sudan and that the U.S. is free to move them to another location, including back to the U.S., to more safely carry out these proceedings. It is unclear whether the government has plans to relocate the group.",

      "Judge James Boasberg, chief judge of the US District Court for the District of Columbia, attends a panel discussion at the annual ABA Spring Antitrust Meeting in Washington, D.C. (AFP/Getty Images)",
      "U.S. District Judge James Boasberg last week ordered the Trump administration to provide all non-citizens deported from the U.S. to a maximum-security prison in El Salvador to be afforded the opportunity to seek habeas relief in court and challenge their alleged gang status \u2013 the latest in a heated fight centered on Trump's use of the 1798 Alien Enemies Act to deport certain migrants.",
      "Boasberg reiterated in the 69-page ruling that due process includes providing migrants deported to CECOT prior notice of removal, as well as so-called habeas protections, or the right to challenge their removals in court. He gave the Trump administration until Wednesday to submit to the court plans for how it will go about providing the habeas relief to plaintiffs held at CECOT.",
      "CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP",
      "\"Defendants plainly deprived these individuals of their right to seek habeas relief before their summary removal from the United States \u2014 a right that need not itself be vindicated through a habeas petition,\" Boasberg said in his order.",
      "The order is almost certain to spark fierce backlash from the Trump administration, which has previously railed against Boasberg's earlier rulings and the temporary restraining order handed down in March. Boasberg later found probable cause to hold the administration in contempt of court, citing the government's \"willful disregard\" for his March 15 emergency order, which ordered the administration to halt its deportation under the Alien Enemies Act, and immediately return all planes to the U.S., which did not happen.",

      "Hogg, 25, was elected vice chair in February but is currently at risk of losing that role after stirring tensions with party leadership.

      "\"It has plenty of warts, and we\u2019re all trying to change those, for sure, but the longer we continue this fight, the harder it is for us to actually do what we all want to do, which is make a difference in this country again,\" Martin said in the recording, as the party is trying to regroup following Democrats' 2024 election defeat.",

I\u2019m used to that. I spent 14 years as a chair. I\u2019m used to getting beat up on.\"",
      "\"But you know, this is, this is really, everything you know from this election, this credentials report, how Malcom\u2019s been treated in this to you know, the fact the election itself, how Shasti and Jeanna were treated in this,\" Martin said. \"I\u2019m just quite frustrated to be in this position because what you\u2019ve done, whether you like it or not, or know it or not, David, I\u2019m trying to \u2013 no one knows who the hell I am, right? I\u2019m trying to get my sea legs underneath of me and actually develop any amount of credibility, so I can go out there and raise the money and do the job I need to to put ourselves in a position to win.\"",
      "\"And again, I don\u2019t think you intended this, but you essentially destroyed any chance I have to show the leadership that I need to,\" Martin said. \"So, it\u2019s really frustrating.\"",

      "\"Instead of helping to rebuild the party he\u2019s supposed to serve, he\u2019s attacking it for personal gain,\" Kleeb continued. \"That might boost his PAC's fundraising, but it erodes trust in the very institution we\u2019re trying to reform and strengthen. I\u2019m proud of Chair Martin and the reforms we\u2019re advancing, which includes keeping the DNC out of primaries so voters decide on Democratic nominees.

While Chair Martin and I have had our disagreements we are both in this to build the strongest party possible.\"",
      "\"Our nation is in a moment of crisis and the people are looking for us to lead,\" Hogg said. \"This is a distraction that prevents us from doing that. Do not help the GOP.\"",

      "\"BS. It was you. Everyone knows it,\" New York Democratic state Sen. James Skoufis responded on X. \"Leaking audio of a private call with party leadership is a disgrace and shows how deeply unserious and uncommitted you are to building a better, stronger, more inclusive Democratic Party.\"",
      "Martin, meanwhile, said in a statement that he's \"not going anywhere,\" and he took the job as DNC chair \"to fight Republicans, not Democrats.\"",
      "\"As I said when I was elected, our fight is not within the Democratic Party, our fight is and has to be solely focused on Donald Trump and the disastrous Republican agenda,\" he said. \"That\u2019s the work that I will continue to do every day.\"",

That's the type of passionate leadership we should want for our party. The fact that someone would secretly record and share audio of him candidly discussing that is more a reflection of their character than the Chair's. Begs the question, what are their true intentions.\"",
      "DNC\u00a0Associate Chair Shasti Conrad, who was briefly mentioned on the recording, said in a statement to Fox News Digital, \"During the DNC Officers call, we all were operating under the assumption that this was a confidential call amongst colleagues.

The goal is to simplify access, reduce paper card replacements and improve data protection.",

Many of them were issued before 1983 and lack basic security features, making them easier to forge or misuse.Rising identity theft risks: Your SSN is one of the most sensitive identifiers tied to your name.

Long lines at SSA offices and delays in mail processing have made it harder for people to get help quickly. A digital SSN provides faster, safer and more convenient access to your number when you need it.",

      "2) Verify your identity: You\u2019ll be asked to provide your name, birthdate, SSN and address. The SSA may use a third-party identity verification service and ask questions based on your credit report.",
      "3) Choose a username and password: Use a strong, unique password and set up two-factor authentication with your phone number or an authenticator app. Consider using a\u00a0password manager to generate and store complex passwords.",

      "1) Use a strong password for your SSA account: Create a unique, complex password for your\u00a0\"My Social Security\"\u00a0account and enable\u00a0two-factor authentication.

Consider using a\u00a0password manager to generate and store complex passwords. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 here.",
      "2) Avoid public Wi-Fi when accessing your SSN: If you're checking your SSA account, avoid doing so over unsecured networks like\u00a0public Wi-Fi. Use a secure home network or\u00a0VPN to encrypt your connection and protect your session from hackers.\u00a0For the best VPN software, see my expert review of the best VPNs for browsing the web privately on your\u00a0Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "3) Be cautious of phishing scams and use strong antivirus software: Scammers often pose as the SSA to trick you into revealing your SSN. Don\u2019t click links in unsolicited emails or texts and never give personal information unless you\u2019re sure the source is legitimate. Always go directly to\u00a0ssa.gov if in doubt.",

      "4) Monitor your credit and bank accounts and use an identity theft service: Staying on top of your financial activity is one of the most effective ways to catch identity theft early. That\u2019s where identity protection services come in. Identity theft companies can monitor personal information like your Social Security number, phone number and email address and alert you if it is being sold on the dark web or being used to open an account. They can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals.\u00a0See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft.",
      "A man looking over his Social Security information (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "5) Check your credit reports: Make it a habit to review your credit reports regularly. Look for unfamiliar accounts, unauthorized inquiries or incorrect personal information. If something seems off, contact the credit bureau right away to dispute it.",
      "6) Request an IRS Identity Protection PIN: Prevent fraudulent tax filings using your SSN by setting up an\u00a0Identity Protection PIN with the IRS. This six-digit number adds another layer of protection during tax season.",
      "7) Review your Social Security earnings record: Log in to your\u00a0\"My Social Security\" account regularly to review your earnings history and benefits. This helps ensure your information hasn\u2019t been altered or compromised.",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaways",
      "Starting this summer, the SSA will let you view your Social Security number online through your \"My Social Security\" account. It\u2019s a secure, convenient update that cuts down on lost cards and office visits. To use it safely, set up strong login credentials and two-factor authentication.

      "Glide underwater with CudaJet and make the ocean your playground. Kurt Knutsson discusses the redesigned tech that might be your next big thrilling adventure.",
      "If you've ever dreamed of gliding underwater with the freedom of a dolphin, the CudaJet might be the gadget for you. Unlike most underwater propulsion systems that strap onto your arms or legs, the CudaJet is worn like a backpack, giving you a hands-free way to cruise beneath the surface. It's a fresh approach that feels a lot more natural and comfortable, especially for longer swims.",
      "The CudaJet's story started almost seven years ago. Back then, it was just a prototype called the Cuda, a passion project by British designer Archie O'Brien during his final year at Loughborough College of Art and Design, now known as Loughborough Design School. Archie wanted something lighter and faster than anything else out there, and in 2023 his vision became reality with the first commercial CudaJet.",
      "Now, the CudaJet has been redesigned with a longer battery life, lighter build and updated features, making it even more appealing to underwater adventure seekers.",

      "CudaJet underwater jetpack: How it works and what\u2019s new",
      "So, what's it like to use? The main unit is a dual-jet-drive pack that attaches to a padded neoprene harness, which you wear on your torso. You control everything with a hardwired, trigger-style remote that lets you adjust your speed and keep an eye on the battery level. One of the biggest improvements for 2025 is the battery. While the original model provided approximately 40 minutes of underwater fun for every 75-minute charge, the latest version extends that time to a full 90 minutes per charge. That's more than double the original runtime, so you can explore even more on a single outing.",
      "CudaJet can take you down to a maximum depth of 131 feet, and it delivers about 88 pounds of thrust. That translates to a top speed of roughly 10 feet per second, or about 6.7 mph. Now, that might not sound fast on land, but underwater it's a whole different story. The company likes to point out that at 10 feet per second, the drag force on your body is about the same as flying through air at nearly 200 mph. It's an exhilarating experience that feels powerful and smooth.",
      "The 2025 redesign also trimmed some weight from the original, reducing it from approximately 33 pounds to just over 30 pounds, including the harness. The harness itself comes in four sizes, so you can get a fit that feels just right. Safety is clearly a priority as well. Each CudaJet ships with a factory-set safety depth of about 10 feet, which you can adjust up to the full 131 feet if you're feeling adventurous. If you ever go past your set limit, the motor cuts out and floats you right back to the surface. The controller's full-color display keeps you updated on your speed, battery and depth at all times.",

Each jetpack is made to order, handcrafted and painted in the U.K. The\u00a02025 package starts at around $31,000, which is a jump from the original price, but it now includes a two-year warranty, a luxury hard case and a fast charger. For those who want something even more exclusive, there's a Founder's Edition with lifetime product access, in-water training with the founder and a lifetime warranty, but only 20 of those are being made.",

The process involves custom-fitting the harness to your size and selecting your preferred finish, all of which are handcrafted in the U.K. Due to this approach, there is typically a wait time before delivery, which varies depending on demand and the customization options.

    "story": [
      "The CyberGuy explains steps you can take to protect yourself from scams.",
      "Online scams thrive on the urgency and fear of their victims. If you've ever been a victim of a scam, you\u2019d know that bad actors often try to rush you into taking action by creating a sense of fear. A scammer may call you impersonating a government agency and claim your Social Security number has been linked to drug trafficking.",
      "A phishing email might ask you to update your tax details or claim you\u2019ve won a lottery or a free product, all to get you to click a malicious link.",
      "A more effective tactic scammers use is sending fake login alerts. These are warnings that someone has logged into your account, prompting you to take immediate action. This method works well because legitimate services like Google, Apple, Netflix and Facebook also send these types of notifications when someone, including you, logs in from a new device. It can be tricky to tell the difference.",

      "How login alert scams work and why they\u2019re so effective",
      "Scammers often pose as login alerts from Google, Apple, Meta or even your bank, complete with official-looking logos, because fear is effective. But not every alert is a scam. In many cases, these notifications are legitimate and can help you detect unauthorized access to your accounts. Let\u2019s focus on the scam side first.",
      "Login alert scams have been around for a while. Early reports date back to 2021, and the trend has persisted since then. In 2022, reports surfaced that scammers were impersonating Meta and sending phishing emails to users.",
      "FBI WARNS OF SCAM TARGETING VICTIMS WITH FAKE HOSPITALS AND POLICE",
      "One such email used a clean layout with minimal text. It avoided the usual scare tactics and stuck to a simple message. But that is not always the case. A common red flag in phishing attempts is the tendency to overload the email with unnecessary details. These messages often include cluttered formatting, excessive explanations and an increasing number of typos or design errors. One phishing email simply gets to the point:",

      "What\u2019s concerning now is that poor grammar is no longer a reliable sign of a scam. Thanks to AI, even those with limited English skills can write emails that sound polished and professional. As a result, many phishing messages today read just like legitimate emails from trusted companies.",
      "Receiving a phishing email is not the real issue. The real problem starts when you click on it. Most of these emails contain links that lead to fake login pages, designed to look exactly like platforms such as Facebook, Google or your bank.",
      "If you enter your credentials there, they go directly to the scammer. In some cases, simply clicking the link can trigger a malware download, especially if your browser is outdated or your device lacks proper security. Once inside, attackers can steal personal information, monitor your activity or take control of your accounts.",

      "For instance, a legit Google security alert might say, \"We detected a login from a new sign-in to your Google Account on a Pixel 6 Pro device. If this was you, you don't need to do anything. If not, we'll help you secure your account.\"\u00a0\u00a0It may include a \"Check activity\" button, but that link always redirects to a google.com address, and it won\u2019t prompt you to reenter your password via the email link.

Don\u2019t click any links or attachments and use strong antivirus software: Instead, manually log in to the real site (or open the official app) by typing the URL or using a bookmarked link. This guarantees you\u2019re not walking into a scammer\u2019s trap. The FTC recommends this: if you have an account with that company, contact them via the website or phone number you know is real,\u00a0not the info in the email.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices.

      "2. Remove your data from the internet: Scammers are able to send you targeted messages because your data, like your email address or phone number, is already out there. This often happens due to past data breaches and shady data brokers. A data removal service can help clean up your digital trail by removing your information from public databases and people-search sites. It\u2019s not a quick fix, but over time, it reduces how easily scammers can find and target you.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice.\u00a0They aren\u2019t cheap, and neither is your privacy.\u00a0These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It\u2019s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.\u00a0By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",

      "3. Check your account activity:\u00a0Go to your account\u2019s security or sign-in page. Services like Gmail, iCloud or your bank let you review recent logins and devices. If you see nothing unusual, you\u2019re safe. If you do find a strange login, follow the site\u2019s process (usually changing your password and logging out all devices). Even if you don\u2019t find anything odd, change your password as a precaution. Do it through the official site or app, not the email. Consider using a\u00a0password manager to generate and store complex passwords.",
      "4. Enable two-factor authentication (2FA): This is your best backup. With\u00a02FA enabled, even if someone has your password, they can\u2019t gain access without your phone and an additional second factor. Both Google and Apple make 2FA easy and say it \"makes it harder for scammers\" to hijack your account.",

      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "You shouldn\u2019t have to vet every sketchy email. In fact, your email\u2019s spam filters catch most phishing attempts for you. Keep them enabled, and make sure your software is up to date so that malicious sites and attachments are blocked. Still, the most powerful filter is your own awareness. You're definitely not alone in this. People receive these spammy login scares every day. By keeping a cool head and following the steps above, you're already ahead of the game.",

      "May 7 is the deadline to get a REAL ID, and some DMVs are facing large crowds and major backup. FOX's Asher Reed spoke with FOX 35 Orlando from outside a DMV in Antioch, Tennessee, with more on the issue.",
      "If you've received a text message claiming to be from your state's Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) and threatening you with fines or penalties unless you pay up, you're not alone. A new wave of scam texts is sweeping across the country, targeting drivers in states like Connecticut, Pennsylvania, Georgia, Florida, New York, California, Illinois, New Jersey, Virginia, Colorado, Vermont, Texas, North Carolina and even Washington, D.C.",
      "These messages look official and urgent, warning you about supposed unpaid tickets or tolls and demanding immediate payment. But don't be fooled, as these texts are sophisticated scams designed to steal your personal information or money.",

The text threatens consequences, such as credit score damage, revoked driving privileges, suspended vehicle registration or increased toll fees, if you do not pay the bill you have supposedly incurred. To make the message appear legit, the scammers often include a date for penalties to begin, a fake administrative code and a link that appears to be an official DMV website.",

These are two powerful psychological motivators that can send you into a panic since your driving privileges are at risk, or you're facing financial consequences. The aim is to get you to act hastily without pausing to verify the source. The messages also mimic legitimate government communications by including familiar terms, official-sounding codes and web addresses that appear authentic.

      "1. Be skeptical of any message creating urgency or panic: Scammers rely on fear and urgency to trick you into acting without thinking. If a message pressures you to act immediately, that's a major red flag.",
      "2. Check for obvious red flags: Look for signs like strange sender addresses, awkward language, misspellings or links that don't match your state's official DMV website.",
      "3. Do not click any links or reply, and use strong antivirus software: Legitimate DMVs will not ask for payments, personal details or sensitive information via unsolicited text messages. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "4. Verify directly with your DMV: If you're concerned the message might be real, contact your state's DMV using the official website or a trusted phone number. Never use the contact information provided in the suspicious text.",
      "5. Consider a Personal Data Removal Service:\u00a0Your personal information is widely available online, which can make you a bigger target for these types of scams, therefore you might look into a personal data removal service. These services work by submitting opt-out requests to data brokers that collect and sell your information, helping to reduce your digital footprint and making it harder for scammers to find your contact details.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren\u2019t cheap \u2014 and neither is your privacy.\u00a0 These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It\u2019s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.\u00a0 By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "6. Delete the message immediately and block the sender: Removing the text helps prevent accidental clicks and reduces the risk of falling for the scam later. Also, be sure to\u00a0block phone numbers and texts that send spam or scam messages, reducing future risk.",
      "7. Register your number with the\u00a0National Do Not Call Registry: While this won't stop all scams, it can help reduce unwanted communications.",
      "8. Don't provide any personal or financial information: Never share your Social Security number, driver's license number, banking information, or passwords in response to an unsolicited text.",
      "9. If you clicked the link or gave out information, act quickly: If you accidentally entered personal or financial information, contact your bank, credit card provider or local law enforcement right away to minimize potential damage.",
      "10. Keep your phone's security features updated: Ensure your\u00a0device's operating system and security software are current to help block known scam numbers and malicious links.",
      "11. Report the scam:\u00a0Forward the message to 7726 (SPAM) to alert your mobile provider and help block similar messages in the future. Mark the message as junk or spam within your messaging app, if possible. File a complaint with the Federal Trade Commission at\u00a0reportfraud.ftc.gov or the FBI's Internet Crime Complaint Center at\u00a0ic3.gov.",
      "DON\u2019T GET CAUGHT IN THE \"APPLE ID SUSPENDED\" PHISHING SCAM",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaways",
      "Scam texts pretending to be from the DMV are getting more convincing, but you don't have to be their next victim. Staying skeptical of urgent messages, double-checking anything that seems off and never clicking suspicious links can go a long way in protecting your personal information. Remember, the real DMV will never pressure you for payment or sensitive details over text. By staying alert, you can help prevent these scams and keep your personal information and money secure.",

      "The demographic landscape in the U.S. is shifting rapidly, with the median age now at 38.9, almost a decade older than it was in 1980.",
      "By 2050, the population of adults over 65 is projected to surge from 58 million to 82 million, intensifying the already urgent challenge of eldercare. With falls remaining the top cause of injury among older adults, the need for innovative, tech-driven solutions has never been clearer.",

      "How MIT\u2019s E-BAR robot helps prevent falls and support senior mobility",
      "E-BAR, short for\u00a0Elderly Bodily Assistance Robot, is not your typical assistive device. Rather than relying on harnesses or wearables, which many seniors find cumbersome or stigmatizing, E-BAR operates as a set of robotic handlebars that follow users from behind. This allows individuals to walk freely, lean on the robot's arms for support or receive full-body assistance when transitioning between sitting and standing. The robot's articulated body, constructed from 18 interconnected bars, mimics the natural movement of the human body, delivering a seamless and intuitive experience.",
      "AI ROBOTS HELP NURSES BEAT BURNOUT AND TRANSFORM HOSPITAL CARE",
      "The engineering behind E-BAR's mobility is equally impressive. The robot's 220-pound base is meticulously designed to support the weight of an average adult without tipping or slipping, and its omnidirectional wheels enable smooth navigation through tight spaces and around household obstacles. This means E-BAR can move effortlessly alongside users, providing support in real time, whether they are reaching for a high shelf or stepping out of a bathtub.",

      "Inside MIT\u2019s E-BAR: A fall-prevention robot designed for aging in place",
      "What sets E-BAR apart from previous eldercare robots is its integrated fall-prevention system. Each arm is embedded with airbags made from soft, grippable materials that can inflate instantly if a fall is detected. This rapid response cushions the user without causing bruising, and, crucially, it does so without requiring the user to wear any special gear. In lab tests, E-BAR successfully supported elderly volunteers as they performed everyday tasks that often pose a risk for falls, such as bending down, stretching up or navigating the tricky edge of a bathtub.",
      "Currently, E-BAR is operated via remote control, but the MIT team is already working on automating its navigation and assistance features. The vision is for future versions to autonomously follow users, assess their real-time fall risk using machine learning algorithms and provide adaptive support as their mobility needs evolve.",

E-BAR's U-shaped handlebars leave the front of the user completely open, allowing for a natural stride and easy exit at any time. The robot is slim enough to fit through standard doorways and is designed to blend into the home environment, making it a practical addition rather than an intrusive medical device.",
      "MIT researchers see E-BAR as part of a broader ecosystem of assistive technologies, each tailored to different stages of aging and mobility. While some devices may offer predictive fall detection or harness-based support, E-BAR's unique combination of full-body assistance, fall prevention and user autonomy addresses a critical gap for those who want to maintain independence but need occasional support.",

      "Currently, MIT's E-BAR robot is still in the prototype stage and is not yet available for consumer purchase. The research team is continuing to refine the design and aims to bring it to market in the coming years, but it could take 5\u201310 years before the device receives full regulatory approval and becomes commercially accessible.",
      "Looking forward, the research team is also focused on refining E-BAR's design to make it slimmer, more maneuverable and even more intuitive to use. They are also exploring ways to integrate advanced AI for real-time fall prediction and adaptive assistance, ensuring that the robot can meet users' changing needs as they age. The ultimate goal is to provide seamless, continuous support, empowering seniors to live safely and confidently in their own homes.",

It's easy to see how something like this could make a big difference for seniors wanting to stay independent without feeling tied down by bulky or uncomfortable devices. As the technology improves, it could change the way we think about caring for older adults, making everyday life safer and a bit easier for everyone involved.",

While most people worry about social media leaks or email hacks, a far less visible threat comes from data brokers.",
      "I still find it hard to believe that companies like this are allowed to operate with so little legal scrutiny. These firms trade in personal information without our knowledge or consent. What baffles me even more is that they aren\u2019t serious about protecting the one thing that is central to their business model: data.",
      "Just last year, we saw news of a massive data breach at a data broker called National Public Data, which\u00a0exposed 2.7 billion records. And now another data broker, LexisNexis, a major name in the industry, has reported a significant breach that exposed sensitive information from more than 364,000 people.",

      "LexisNexis breach went undetected for months after holiday hack",
      "LexisNexis filed a\u00a0notice with the Maine attorney general revealing that a hacker accessed consumer data through a third-party software development platform. The breach happened on Dec. 25, 2024, but the company only discovered it months later. LexisNexis was alerted on April 1, 2025, by an unnamed individual who claimed to have found sensitive files. It remains unclear whether this person was responsible for the breach or merely came across the exposed data.",
      "MASSIVE DATA BREACH EXPOSES 184 MILLION PASSWORDS AND LOGINS",
      "A spokesperson for LexisNexis confirmed that the hacker gained access to the company\u2019s GitHub account. This is a platform commonly used by developers to store and collaborate on code. Security guidelines repeatedly warn against storing sensitive information in such repositories; however, mistakes such as exposed access tokens and personal data files continue to occur.",
      "The stolen data varies from person to person but includes full names, birthdates, phone numbers, mailing and email addresses, Social Security numbers and driver's license numbers. LexisNexis has not confirmed whether it received any ransom demand or had further contact with the attacker.",

      "Why the LexisNexis hack is a bigger threat than you realize",
      "LexisNexis isn\u2019t a household name for most people, but it plays a major role in how personal data is harvested and used behind the scenes. The company pulls information from a wide range of sources, compiling detailed profiles that help other businesses assess risk and detect fraud. Its clients include banks, insurance companies and government agencies.",
      "In 2023, the New York Times reported that several car manufacturers had been sharing driving data with LexisNexis without notifying vehicle owners. That information was then sold to insurance companies, which used it to adjust premiums based on individual driving behavior. The story made one thing clear. LexisNexis has access to a staggering amount of personal detail, even from people who have never willingly engaged with the company.",
      "Law enforcement also uses LexisNexis tools to dig up information on suspects. These systems offer access to phone records, home addresses and other historical data. While such tools might assist in investigations, they also highlight a serious issue. When this much sensitive information is concentrated in one place, it becomes a single point of failure. And as the recent breach shows, that failure is no longer hypothetical.",

      "Keeping your personal data safe online can feel overwhelming, but a few practical steps can make a big difference in protecting your privacy and reducing your digital footprint. Here are 7 effective ways to take control of your information and keep it out of the wrong hands:",
      "1. Remove your data from the internet:\u00a0The most effective way to take control of your data and avoid data brokers from selling it is to opt for data removal services. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time. Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "Get a\u00a0free scan to find out if your personal information is already out on the web.",
      "2. Review privacy settings: Take a few minutes to explore the privacy and security settings on the services you use. For example, limit who can see your social media posts, disable unnecessary location-sharing on your phone and consider turning off ad personalization on accounts like Google and Facebook. Most browsers let you block third-party cookies or clear tracking data. The FTC suggests comparing the privacy notices of different sites and apps and choosing ones that let you opt out of sharing when possible.",
      "3. Use privacy-friendly tools: Install browser extensions or plugins that block ads and trackers (such as uBlock Origin or Privacy Badger). You might switch to a more private search engine (like DuckDuckGo or Brave) that doesn\u2019t log your queries. Consider using a browser\u2019s \"incognito\" or private mode when you don\u2019t want your history saved, and regularly clear your cookies and cache. Even small habits, like logging out of accounts when not in use or using a password manager, make you less trackable.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "4. Beware of phishing links and use strong antivirus software:\u00a0Scammers may try to get access to your financial details and other important data using phishing links. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping\u00a0your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "5. Be cautious with personal data: Think twice before sharing extra details. Don\u2019t fill out online surveys or quizzes that ask for personal or financial information unless you trust the source. Create separate email addresses for sign-ups (so marketing emails don\u2019t go to your main inbox). Only download apps from official stores and check app permissions.",
      "6. Opt out of data broker lists: Many data brokers offer ways to opt out or delete your information, though it can be a tedious process. For example, there are sites like Privacy Rights Clearinghouse or the Whitepages opt-out page that list popular brokers and their opt-out procedures. The FTC\u2019s consumer guide,\u00a0\"Your Guide to Protecting Your Privacy Online,\" includes tips on opting out of targeted ads and removing yourself from people-search databases. Keep in mind you may have to repeat this every few months.",
      "7. Be wary of mailbox communications:\u00a0Bad actors may also try to scam you through snail mail. The data leak gives them access to your address. They may impersonate people or brands you know and use themes that require urgent attention, such as missed deliveries, account suspensions and security alerts.",
      "HR FIRM CONFIRMS 4M RECORDS EXPOSED IN MAJOR HACK",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "For many, the LexisNexis breach may be the first time they realize just how much of their data is in circulation. Unlike a social media platform or a bank, there is no clear customer relationship with a data broker, and that makes it harder to demand transparency. This incident should prompt serious discussion around what kind of oversight is necessary in industries that operate in the shadows. A more informed public and stronger regulation may be the only things standing between personal data and permanent exposure.",

      "Phantom 3500 (Otto Aviation)",
      "Why is windowless design such a big deal for aircraft?",
      "Most travelers don't realize that windows are structural weak points in an aircraft. They require extra reinforcement, add weight and disrupt the smooth flow of air over the fuselage (the main body of the plane). This increases drag, a resistance force that makes flight less efficient. By removing windows, the Phantom 3500's surface allows air to flow with minimal turbulence, helping the aircraft achieve what Otto Aviation describes as \"full laminar flow characteristics.\"",
      "HYPERSONIC JET PROMISES NYC TO LONDON IN UNDER AN HOUR",
      "This is a major contributor to its impressive aerodynamic performance. The windowless design is not just for aesthetics. Otto Aviation specifically engineered the fuselage to optimize laminar flow, using lightweight materials and smooth surfaces to further reduce drag and fuel consumption.",

These displays stream real-time video from cameras mounted on the aircraft's exterior, offering passengers a panoramic, immersive view of the skies. Otto Aviation refers to this system as Super Natural Vision, a proprietary technology that replaces traditional windows with state-of-the-art digital displays, seamlessly integrating real-time external views for a unique in-flight experience.",
      "The spacious, luminous cabin measures 800 cubic feet with a 6-foot-5-inch ceiling, comfortably accommodating four or more passengers in a luxurious, flexible layout. The cabin can seat up to nine passengers, depending on configuration, and is designed to maximize comfort and functionality. Freed from the constraints of window placement, the interior can be customized for relaxation, productivity or entertainment, ensuring passengers enjoy the journey as much as the destination.",

By sustaining laminar flow, the aircraft aims to improve fuel efficiency by 35%. This allows it to maintain high-speed performance while consuming less fuel, making it one of the most aerodynamically efficient aircraft ever developed. It operates in the transonic range (Mach 0.8\u20131.2), balancing speed and efficiency. It can also reach a cruising altitude of 51,000 feet, significantly higher than most commercial airliners, which typically fly between 30,000 and 40,000 feet.",
      "Thanks to its streamlined fuselage and optimized aerodynamics, the Phantom 3500 burns 50% less fuel than conventional business jets. This reduction in fuel consumption translates to lower operating costs and a significant decrease in carbon emissions. The Phantom 3500\u2019s wings achieve complete laminar flow, allowing for smoother airflow and reduced drag, enabling the aircraft to take off from runways as short as 3,500 feet, nearly doubling the number of accessible airports in the U.S. alone compared to similar-sized jets.",

In a\u00a0public notice titled \"Data Security Information,\" the company revealed that a \"third-party customer service provider\" had been compromised.

      "It mainly consists of contact information relating to customers who had contacted our customer service help desk in the past. This may have included one or more of the following: name, email address, telephone number, gender and/or birth date.",

      "Privacy and the security of your data is our priority. Upon becoming aware of this incident, adidas took proactive and immediate steps to investigate and contain the incident. This includes further enhancing security measures and resetting passwords for customer service accounts.",
      "What you can do",
      "We are currently unaware of any harm (such as identity theft or fraud) being caused to our customers as a result of this incident. There are no immediate steps that you need to take. Although, as always, please remain vigilant and look out for any suspicious messages. As a reminder, adidas will never directly contact you to ask that you provide us with financial information, such as your credit card details, bank account information or passwords.",

The lack of transparency around the name of the third-party vendor and the absence of concrete numbers or locations for affected users has created frustration among observers and possibly among customers themselves.",
      "The earlier regional reports from Turkey and Korea might suggest that this incident was either global in scale or that similar third-party vendors were independently targeted. In either case, the company's current handling of the situation has left room for speculation. Adidas claims it is in the process of informing potentially affected customers, but it has not detailed the method or timeline for this outreach.",
      "We reached out to adidas for a comment, and a representative referred us to this statement on their\u00a0website.

      "If you think you were affected or just want to be cautious, here are some steps you can take right now to stay safe from the Adidas data breach:",
      "1. Scrub your data from the internet using a personal data removal service:\u00a0The more exposed your personal information is online, the easier it is for scammers to use it against you. Following the Adidas breach, consider removing your information from public databases and people-search sites. Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "Get a\u00a0free scan to find out if your personal information is already out on the web.",
      "2. Watch out for phishing scams and use strong antivirus software:\u00a0With access to your email and phone number, Adidas attackers can craft convincing phishing emails pretending to be from healthcare providers or banks. These emails might include malicious links designed to install malware or steal login information. To defend yourself, use a strong antivirus program.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "3. Safeguard against identity theft and use identity theft protection:\u00a0Hackers now have access to high-value information from the Adidas breach. This makes you a prime target for identity theft. You might want to consider investing in identity theft protection, which can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals. Signing up for identity theft protection gives you 24/7 monitoring, alerts for unusual activity and support if your identity is stolen.\u00a0See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft.",
      "4. Set up fraud alerts: Requesting fraud alerts notifies creditors that they need extra verification before issuing credit in your name. You can request fraud alerts through any one of the three major credit bureaus; they\u2019ll notify the others. This adds another layer of protection without completely freezing access to credit.",
      "5. Change passwords and use a password manager: Update passwords on any accounts tied to compromised data. Use unique passwords that are hard to guess and let a password manager do the heavy lifting by generating secure ones for you. Reused passwords are an easy target after breaches. Consider\u00a0password managers for convenience and security. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 here.",
      "6. Be wary of social engineering attacks: Hackers may use stolen details like names or birthdates from breaches in phone scams or fake customer service calls designed to trick you into revealing more sensitive info. Never share personal details over unsolicited calls or emails. Social engineering attacks rely on trust, and vigilance is key.",
      "HACKERS USING MALWARE TO STEAL DATA FROM USB FLASH DRIVES",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "The Adidas breach shows that even companies with decades of brand equity and a massive global footprint are not immune to lapses in data security. It underscores the need for companies to go beyond basic compliance and actively evaluate the cybersecurity standards of every partner in their ecosystem. Consumers are becoming increasingly aware of the trade-offs they make when sharing their personal information, and brands that fail to meet this moment may find their reputations eroding faster than they expect.",

      "Using AI to build the hospitals of the future",
      "Foxconn's approach to smart hospitals goes beyond deploying robots. The company has developed a suite of digital tools using Nvidia platforms, including AI models that monitor patient vitals and digital twins that simulate hospital environments for planning and training purposes.",
      "The process starts in the data center, where large AI models are trained on Nvidia supercomputers. Hospitals then use digital twins to test and train robots in virtual settings before deploying them in real-world scenarios, ensuring that these systems are both safe and effective.",

      "Nurabot is already making a difference in daily hospital operations. The robot handles medicine deliveries, ward patrols and visitor guidance, which Foxconn estimates can reduce nurse workloads by up to 30%. In one ward, Nurabot delivers wound care kits and educational materials directly to patient bedsides, saving nurses multiple trips to supply rooms and allowing them to dedicate more time to their patients. The robot is also especially helpful during visiting hours and night shifts, when staffing levels are typically lower.",
      "Nurses hope future versions of Nurabot will be able to converse with patients in multiple languages, recognize faces for personalized interactions and even assist with lifting patients when needed. For example, a lung patient who needs two nurses to sit up for breathing exercises might only require one nurse with Nurabot's help, freeing the other to care for other patients.",

      "From the road to the sky in minutes",
      "So, how does it work? The AirCar looks like a sleek sports coupe on the road, with four wheels and a design that would fit right in next to a luxury sedan. When you need to fly, you simply drive to a runway, press a button and watch as the wings unfold and the tail extends. The transformation takes about 80 seconds, and there's no manual tinkering required. Once the wings are locked and the tail is in place, you're ready for takeoff. The steering wheel transforms into a flight yoke, and extra pedals appear for rudder control. The controls are designed to be intuitive for pilots, so if you already have a private pilot's license, you won't need to learn anything new.",

      "ORLANDO'S PLAN FOR FLYING CARS TAKES OFF",
      "Performance that impresses",
      "Under the hood, the production AirCar will offer three engine options, all 3.2-liter V6s from South African company Adept Airmotive. The base model puts out 280 horsepower, while the top version offers 340 horsepower with twin turbos. On the road, the AirCar can reach a top speed of about 124 mph, and it handles and feels much like a sports car. In the air, it cruises at 155 mph and can travel up to 620 miles on a single tank of fuel.",
      "The cabin is not pressurized, so the recommended ceiling is 10,000 feet, but it could go higher with oxygen tanks. The AirCar runs on regular high-octane gasoline, and you can fill up at most gas stations. In terms of size, it is about as long as a Mercedes S-Class and narrow enough to fit in a standard parking spot.",
      "AirCar (Klein Vision) (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "THIS FLYING MOTORCYCLE CAN TAKE YOU FROM TRAFFIC TO SKY IN MINUTES",
      "What licenses do you need to drive and fly the AirCar?",
      "To operate the AirCar on the road, you will need a standard driver's license, just like any other car. If you want to take to the skies, you'll also need a private pilot's license. According to Klein Vision, the AirCar is designed so that if you already have a private pilot's license, you won't have to learn anything new to fly it. This means owners will need both driving and flying licenses, along with access to a runway, to fully experience everything the AirCar can do.",

      "BEST FATHER'S DAY GIFTS FOR EVERY DAD",
      "Pricing and who the AirCar is for",
      "The AirCar is expected to cost between $800,000 and $1.2 million, which puts it in the same category as high-end supercars and small private planes. It is geared toward mega-rich business travelers, air taxi operators and anyone who wants to skip traffic and simply fly over it instead.",
      "AirCar (Klein Vision) (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How does it compare to other flying cars?",
      "Unlike many flying car projects that never make it past the prototype stage, the AirCar is close to full certification and production. It is also one of the few with four wheels, making it truly road-legal in most places. While other companies have spent hundreds of millions on similar ideas, Klein Vision has achieved this on a much smaller budget.",
      "AirCar (Klein Vision) (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What's next? More seats and water landings",
      "Klein Vision isn't stopping with a two-seater. The company is already working on versions with three or four seats, and there's talk of an amphibious model that could land on water. This would open up even more travel possibilities, such as island hopping or reaching remote lakes.",

      "It's wild to think that flying cars have been a daydream for so long, and now the AirCar is right on the verge of making it real. This is a vehicle you could actually see on the road and in the air pretty soon. Sure, you'll need a pilot's license and a pretty big budget, but the fact that something like this is even possible is pretty amazing. Honestly, the idea that we might spot a car rolling up to a runway and then lifting off in just a year or two is kind of crazy.",

      "Tensions between protesters and law enforcement escalated on Saturday, with some protesters throwing objects and law enforcement deploying pepper balls and flash-bangs. Videos also showed looting and a car on fire.",
      "The protests swelled on Sunday, with demonstrators shutting down streets and highways, setting more cars on fire and increased confrontations with law enforcement.",
      "The protests initially began in response to immigration enforcement operations, as the Trump administration has made mass deportations a centerpiece of its domestic policy. In recent days, administration officials have targeted major Democratic cities in their enforcement efforts, including L.A., Chicago and New York.",
      "Trump praised the National Guard on Truth Social for a \"job well done\" in the early hours of Sunday morning, before they'd been deployed in the city.",
      "On Monday, he ratcheted up his rhetoric about the protesters on social media, charging that if any protester spat on a National Guard member, \"they will be hit harder than they have ever been hit before.\"",
      "\"Such disrespect will not be tolerated!\" wrote Trump. On his first day in office, Trump issued roughly 1,500 pardons to people who'd been charged in the Jan. 6, 2021, assault on the Capitol in which 140 law-enforcement officers were injured.",
      "About 300 guard members are currently in L.A., officials said, where they've been tasked with guarding federal properties."

    "summary": "LOS ANGELES \u2014 California Gov.",
    "story": [
      "LOS ANGELES \u2014 California Gov. Gavin Newsom pushed back against threats of arrest by Trump administration officials, remaining defiant as he oversees clashes between law enforcement agents and protesters in response to immigration raids across Los Angeles while also managing an ongoing power struggle with the federal government.",
      "Trump\u2019s \"border czar,\" Tom Homan, warned Saturday that immigration operations and the presence of federal personnel would continue in the city despite criticism from Democratic leaders who've warned it could further escalate protests. He threatened arrest for anyone who obstructs the immigration enforcement effort, including Newsom and Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass \u2014 though he acknowledged that neither yet had \"crossed the line.\"",
      "\u201cI\u2019ll say about anybody,\u201d Homan said. \u201cYou cross that line, it\u2019s a felony to knowingly harbor and conceal an illegal alien. It\u2019s a felony to impede law enforcement doing their job.\u201d",
      "In an interview for MSNBC with NBC News\u2019 Jacob Soboroff, Newsom called Homan's bluff, urging him to \"just get it over with\" and move ahead with the arrest.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s a tough guy. Why doesn\u2019t he do that? He knows where to find me,\u201d Newsom said. \u201cThat kind of bloviating is exhausting. So, Tom, arrest me. Let's go.\"",
      "Bass, meanwhile, dismissed Homan\u2019s warning as unnecessary, emphasizing Sunday that while she opposed the decision to deploy National Guard troops, she has no interest in brawling with the federal government.",
      "\u201cHe had absolutely positively no reason to even say that,\u201d Bass said. \u201cI spoke to him last night. He understands that I am the mayor of the city; the last thing in the world I\u2019m going to do is get into a brawl with the federal government. So that just made no sense. There was no reason for that comment.\u201d",
      "Trump doubled down on Homan's warning Sunday, telling reporters that \u201cofficials who stand in the way of law and order\" will \"face judges.\" He then told reporters on Monday that \u201cI would do it if I were Tom.\"",
      "But two White House officials tell NBC News that, as of now, federal officials and Trump are not seriously looking into plans to arrest Newsom or Bass.",
      "One senior White House official said, \u201cIt\u2019s not being actively planned or considered, but anyone who breaks federal law puts themselves at risk of being arrested. That\u2019s just a basic fact.\u201d",
      "A second White House official said that if Newsom or Bass do \u201csomething to get themselves arrested,\u201d then they could be detained. But, the person added, the optics of arresting the California officials wouldn\u2019t look good for Republicans right now, as it doesn't appear they've broken any laws.",
      "In an interview with Fox and Friends on Monday, Homan said he never had discussions about arresting Newsom and his comments Saturday were hypothetical. \u201cThe reporter asked me, well, could Gov. Newsom or Mayor Bass be arrested? I said \u2018Well, no one\u2019s above the law. If they cross the line and commit a crime, absolutely they can.\u2019 So there was no discussion about arresting Newsom.\u201d",
      "Newsom said Sunday that Trump hadn't expressed any concern about his ability to manage the growing protest in Los Angeles or the prospect of federalizing National Guard troops during a phone call after protests started Friday.",
      "\"We talked for almost 20 minutes, and he barely \u2014 this issue never came up,\" Newsom said. \"We had a very decent conversation.\"",
      "Newsom and Bass have intensely criticized Trump's decision to authorize the deployment of at least 2,000 National Guard troops in response to the protests, arguing they would only inflame tensions in the city already heightened by the large-scale immigration operations.",
      "In a letter to Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, Newsom requested that Trump rescind his order federalizing the troops in Los Angeles County \"and return them to my command.\"",
      "\"In dynamic and fluid situations such as the one in Los Angeles, State and local authorities are the most appropriate ones to evaluate the need for resources and safeguard life and property,\" Newsom said in the letter.",
      "Threats by the administration to arrest elected officials have been a hallmark of Trump's second term, particularly after the high-profile arrest of Newark Mayor Ras Baraka outside an ICE detention facility in New Jersey. The charges were dropped, though the Justice Department charged another elected official with Baraka, Democratic Rep. LaMonica McIver, with two counts of assaulting, resisting and impeding law enforcement officials in connection with the incident."

    "story": [
      "A Burmese American woman was eager to bring her siblings over to the U.S. from Myanmar amid a more than 15-year wait for visas. She\u2019d been hoping to reunite with them since the 1990s, during military rule in her home country, so her brother\u2019s family could start a life in the U.S. But a day after she bought the plane tickets, President Donald Trump ordered a travel ban that included Myanmar.",
      "The woman, 51, and her husband, who were granted anonymity due to fear of retaliation, had sponsored her brother and sister-in-law to immigrate to the U.S. The siblings were then were hoping to bring their own adult kids, too, so that they wouldn\u2019t have to fulfill mandatory military service in the country\u2019s active civil war.",
      "With the travel ban in effect Monday, they said the policy has a heightened impact on people from war-torn countries like Myanmar who had hopes of finding sanctuary in the U.S.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s really frustrating because we were on the cusp of securing their safety to leave that situation,\u201d said her husband, 57, adding he felt like a \u201crug got pulled out from under us in an instant.\u201d",
      "White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson said Trump\u2019s policy is in the \u201cbest interest of the American people and their safety.\u201d",
      "\u201cHis commonsense, country-specific travel restrictions include places that lack proper vetting, exhibit high visa overstay rates, or fail to share identity and threat information,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cThe restrictions fulfill the President\u2019s day one promise to protect American citizens from dangerous foreign actors who may come to the United States and cause us harm.\u201d",
      "The travel restrictions, announced on Wednesday, completely bar entry to the U.S. for people from Myanmar, formerly known as Burma, in addition to those from Afghanistan, the Republic of Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen. Other countries, including Cuba, Laos and Venezuela, are under partial travel restrictions.",
      "According to Trump\u2019s proclamation, several of the countries on the list had declined to accept the repatriation of their nationals while others had visa overstay rates that the administration deemed \u201cunacceptable.\u201d A few countries lacked \u201cthe competence of the central authority\u201d for issuing passports, the proclamation said.",
      "Jackson also pointed out a section in the proclamation that allows for applications for refugee status.",
      "\u201cNothing in this proclamation shall be construed to limit the ability of an individual to seek asylum, refugee status, withholding of removal, or protection under the [international Convention Against Torture], consistent with the laws of the United States,\u201d the proclamation said.",
      "However, after he took office, Trump limited refugee admissions for almost all countries including Myanmar. And in May, the Supreme Court allowed the Trump administration to revoke the temporary legal status of more than 500,000 immigrants that was granted by the Biden administration. Those immigrants came from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela and are now subject to deportation.",
      "Myanmar was among the nine countries in the latest proclamation that Trump also targeted during his first term. In fiscal year 2023, the U.S. issued 13,284 visas to the country, with business and tourism permits making up the most common types of visas. Myanmar recorded 1,384 overstays that fiscal year, equating to an overstay rate of almost 30%.",
      "The new travel ban comes as Myanmar\u2019s violent military regime fights to hold on to power after it seized control from the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi in a 2021 coup. Since then, violence has escalated across the region as the military clashes with ethnic minority rebel groups and pro-democracy militias.",
      "\u201cJunta forces have slaughtered thousands of civilians, bombed and burned villages, and displaced millions of people,\u201d Tom Andrews, United Nations special rapporteur on the human rights situation in Myanmar, said in a press release earlier this year. \u201cMore than 20,000 political prisoners remain behind bars. The economy and public services have collapsed. Famine and starvation loom over large parts of the population.\u201d",
      "Under the new travel ban, anyone who obtained a visa prior to the policy is still able to come to the U.S. But there\u2019s confusion over how the restrictions will be implemented and enforced. The Burmese American woman and her husband are among those with concerns, particularly as there have been several cases of lawful permanent residents and citizens being swept up in the dragnet of Trump\u2019s immigration policies.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s terrifying to think that they could be randomly picked up because somebody had a bad day at the office, or somebody didn\u2019t do their job or didn\u2019t believe that their visa was true,\u201d the woman's husband said. \u201cIt\u2019s quite frankly terrifying.\u201d",
      "For the woman, reunification with her brother has been a long time coming. She became a citizen in the late 1990s and began the process to help bring her sibling over a few years later. At the time, Myanmar had been under the control of a strict military junta that held power from the 1960s until 2011, and for decades had kept the country in a state of extreme isolation and deprivation. She said her brother, whose children were just a few years old then, hoped to come over and root his family in more stability.",
      "\u201cTheir circumstances in Myanmar at that time were very, very bad. That was the system that I grew up in. There was no future for them, no prosperity,\u201d the woman said. \u201cMy brother was concerned for his children\u2019s future and education.\u201d",
      "Amid moves and address changes, the couple said they never received the standard letter notifying them that the woman's brother had been able to progress in his visa process. They assumed the wait was a product of notorious immigration backlogs. It wasn\u2019t until the situation in Myanmar intensified again in recent years that the couple found out that the brother was close to finally being able to immigrate. But by then, the woman said, her brother\u2019s kids had aged out of the system.",
      "According to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, those who turn 21 before being approved for legal permanent resident status are no longer considered a child for immigration purposes and need to file an entirely new application, prolonging the green card process.",
      "At this point, the woman said, her brother and sister-in-law said they were willing to risk possible detention to come to the U.S., particularly if it meant easier access to the American immigration system that would enable them to fight to get their children to come over as well. However, with Myanmar\u2019s military draft in effect, the family is particularly concerned for their safety now that the travel ban adds another barrier to leaving.",
      "\u201cThe reason they wanted to come here was for their kids,\u201d the woman said of her brother and sister-in-law. \u201cNow, it\u2019s really hard to bring my nephews here to save their lives.\u201d",
      "Quyen Dinh, executive director of the Southeast Asia Resource Action Center, said the bans are ultimately another part of \u201cthe engine of Trump\u2019s mass deportation machine.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s focused on demonizing immigrant families and communities by denying them family reunification, that we all rightfully deserve to be whole \u2014 especially now, when the world is more dangerous than ever,\u201d Dinh said.",
      "Rather than protecting individuals\u2019 safety, Dinh said, she believes Trump\u2019s policy punishes those who need an escape from dangerous conditions.",
      "\u201cIt perpetuates the violence that is happening across the world, as opposed to creating conditions for peace or humanitarian relief, and for these families who\u2019ve been separated,\u201d Dinh said.",
      "She also said she views the ban as evidence that the U.S. is misunderstanding its role as a humanitarian leader.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve got people who are legitimately trying to escape a civil war,\u201d the woman's husband said. \u201cNow, because of some arbitrary decision by the Trump administration to pick a certain number of countries \u2026 without consideration of the actual cases, without an exception policy, it hurts them. They\u2019ve done nothing wrong.\u201d"

An amended complaint from Lively alleged that Baldoni also made other women on set feel uncomfortable.",

      "\u201cOur command staff continues to be engaged with the search command while we give our teams time off to rest and recuperate and be ready to rejoin the search for, and capture of, the suspect,\u201d the sheriff's office said.",
      "The sheriff\u2019s office remains the lead agency on the criminal investigation into the deaths of Decker\u2019s three daughters, Evelyn, 8, Paityn, 9, and Olivia Decker, 5, the department said.",

      "An autopsy completed Friday attributed the girls\u2019 cause of death to suffocation, according to Monday\u2019s release. A detective previously wrote in an affidavit in support of an arrest warrant that they had bags over their heads and had been zip-tied.",

      "The affidavit shows that Decker\u2019s ex-wife, Whitney Decker, described her relationship with her ex-husband as cordial and said he\u2019d never previously failed to return their children. A parenting plan imposed by a court last year required him to seek mental health treatment and domestic violence-anger management counseling but he had not done so and refused to sign the plan, according to the affidavit.",
      "Since the girls were found dead, Whitney Decker has called for reforms to the Amber Alert system, which sends out text messages to all cell phones in the area of missing children but was not used after she told authorities that her ex-husband had violated their parenting plan.",

      "CUPERTINO, Calif. \u2014 After stumbling out of the starting gate in Big Tech\u2019s pivotal race to capitalize on artificial intelligence, Apple tried to regain its footing Monday during an annual developers conference that focused mostly on incremental advances and cosmetic changes in its technology.",
      "The presummer rite, which attracted thousands of developers from nearly 60 countries to Apple\u2019s Silicon Valley headquarters, was more subdued than the feverish anticipation that surrounded the event during the previous two years.",
      "Apple highlighted plans for more AI tools designed to simplify people\u2019s lives and make its products even more intuitive while also providing an early glimpse at the biggest redesign of its iPhone software in a decade. In doing so, Apple executives refrained from issuing bold promises of breakthroughs that punctuated recent conferences.",
      "In 2023, Apple unveiled a mixed-reality headset that has been little more than a niche product, and last year WWDC trumpeted its first major foray into the AI craze with an array of new features highlighted by the promise of a smarter and more versatile version of its virtual assistant, Siri \u2014 a goal that has hasn\u2019t been achieved yet.",
      "Apple had intended the planned Siri upgrade to herald its long-awaited attempt to become a major player in the AI craze after getting a late start in a phenomenon that so far has been largely led by OpenAI, Google, Microsoft and an array of cutting-edge startups.",
      "\u201cThis work needed more time to reach our high-quality bar,\u201d Craig Federighi, Apple\u2019s top software executive, said Monday at the outset of the conference.",
      "The showcase unfolded amid nagging questions about whether Apple has lost some of the mystique and innovative drive that turned it into a tech trendsetter during its nearly 50-year history.",
      "Instead of making a big splash as it did with the Vision Pro headset and its AI suite, Apple took a mostly low-key approach that emphasized its effort to spruce up the look of its software while also unveiling a new hub for its video games and new features like a \u201cWorkout Buddy\u201d to help track physical fitness on its smartwatch.",
      "Apple executives promised will make its software more compatible with the increasingly sophisticated computer chips that have been powering its products while also making it easier to toggle between the iPhone, iPad, and Mac.",
      "\u201cOur product experience has become even more seamless and enjoyable,\u201d Apple CEO Tim Cook told the crowd as the 90-minute showcase wrapped up.",
      "Even though it might look like Apple is becoming a technological laggard, Forrester Research analyst Thomas Husson contends the company still has ample time to catch up in an AI race that\u2019s \u201cmore of a marathon, than a sprint. It will force Apple to evolve its operating systems.\u201d",
      "Besides redesigning its software. Apple will switch to a method that automakers have used to telegraph their latest car models by linking them to the year after they first arrive at dealerships. That means the next version of the iPhone operating system due out this autumn will be known as iOS 26 instead of iOS 19 \u2014 as it would be under the previous naming approach that has been used since the device\u2019s 2007 debut.",
      "The iOS 26 upgrade is expected to be released in September around the same time Apple traditionally rolls out the next iPhone models.",
      "In an early sign that AI was going to be a focal point of this year\u2019s conference, Apple opened the proceedings with a short video clip featuring Federighi speeding around a track in a Formula 1 race car. Although it was meant to promote the June 27 release of the Apple film, \u201cF1\u201d starring Brad Pitt, the segment could also be viewed as an unintentional analogy to the company\u2019s attempt to catch up to the rest of the pack in AI technology.",
      "While some of the new AI tricks compatible with the latest iPhones began rolling out late last year as part of free software updates, Apple still hasn\u2019t been able to soup up Siri in the ways that it touted at last year\u2019s conference. The delays became so glaring that a chastened Apple retreated from promoting Siri in its AI marketing campaigns earlier this year.",
      "While Apple has been struggling to make AI that meets its standards, the gap separating it from other tech powerhouses is widening. Google keeps packing more AI into its Pixel smartphone lineup while introducing more of the technology into its search engine to dramatically change the way it works. Samsung, Apple\u2019s biggest smartphone rival, is also leaning heavily into AI. Meanwhile, ChatGPT recently struck a deal that will bring former Apple design guru Jony Ive into the fold to work on a new device expected to compete against the iPhone.",
      "Besides grappling with innovation challenges, Apple also faces regulatory threats that could siphon away billions of dollars in revenue that help finance its research and development. A federal judge is currently weighing whether proposed countermeasures to Google\u2019s illegal monopoly in search should include a ban on long-running deals worth $20 billion annually to Apple while another federal judge recently banned the company from collecting commission on in-app transactions processed outside its once-exclusive payment system.",
      "On top of all that, Apple has been caught in the cross-hairs of President Donald Trump\u2019s trade war with China, a key manufacturing hub for the Cupertino, California, company. Cook successfully persuaded Trump to exempt the iPhone from tariffs during the president\u2019s first administration, but he has had less success during Trump\u2019s second term, which seems more determined to prod Apple to make its products in the U.S.",
      "\u201cThe trade war and uncertainty linked to the tariff policy is of much more concern today for Apple\u2019s business than the perception that Apple is lagging behind on AI innovation,\u201d Husson said.",
      "The multi-dimensional gauntlet facing Apple is spooking investors, causing the company\u2019s stock price to plunge by nearly 20% so far this year \u2014 a decline that has erased $750 billion in shareholder wealth. After beginning the year as the most valuable company in the world, Apple now ranks third behind longtime rival Microsoft, another AI leader, and AI chipmaker Nvidia.",
      "Apple\u2019s shares slipped by more than 1% in Monday\u2019s late afternoon trading \u2014 an early indication the company\u2019s latest announcements didn\u2019t inspire investors."

      "Both the White House and the Social Security Administration called the Supreme Court decision a victory. In a statement, White House spokesperson Elizabeth Huston said it will allow the Trump administration to \u201ccarry out commonsense efforts to eliminate waste, fraud and abuse and modernize government information systems.\u201d",
      "Likewise, Social Security Commissioner Frank Bisignano in a statement said the agency \u201cwill continue driving forward modernization efforts, streamlining government systems, and ensuring improved service and outcomes for our beneficiaries.\u201d",

      "Speaking to reporters at a press conference, Bonta noted that the law Trump used to activate the guard had only been used once before, when then-President Richard Nixon used it in 1970 to activate the guard to deliver mail during a postal strike. He also said it\u2019s the first time the guard had been activated without a governor\u2019s consent since 1965, when President Lyndon B. Johnson deployed troops in Alabama to protect civil rights demonstrators.",
      "The White House had contended the move was necessary to combat \u201clawlessness that has been allowed to fester\u201d in Los Angeles, referring to clashes and confrontations between federal agents carrying out immigration raids and protesters.",
      "\"We did the right thing,\" Trump told reporters Monday, adding the \"place would be burning down\" if he hadn't. \"I\u2019m very happy I got involved. And I think Gavin, in his own way, is probably happy I got involved,\" Trump said.",
      "Newsom had said that there was no need to deploy the National Guard and that Trump took the drastic step out of a desire for a \u201cspectacle.\u201d",
      "He also accused Trump of trying to \"manufacture a crisis.\"",
      "\"He\u2019s hoping for chaos so he can justify more crackdowns, more fear, more control,\u201d Newsom said in a post Sunday on X, where he also urged protesters to \u201cstay peaceful.\u201d",
      "Tensions between protesters and law enforcement escalated on Saturday, with some protesters throwing objects and law enforcement deploying pepper balls and flash-bangs. Videos also showed looting and a car on fire.",
      "The protests swelled on Sunday, with demonstrators shutting down streets and highways, setting more cars on fire and increased confrontations with law enforcement.",
      "The protests initially began in response to immigration enforcement operations, as the Trump administration has made mass deportations a centerpiece of its domestic policy. In recent days, administration officials have targeted major Democratic cities in their enforcement efforts, including L.A., Chicago and New York.",
      "Trump praised the National Guard on Truth Social for a \"job well done\" in the early hours of Sunday morning, before they'd been deployed in the city.",
      "On Monday, he ratcheted up his rhetoric about the protesters on social media, charging that if any protester spat on a National Guard member, \"they will be hit harder than they have ever been hit before.\"",
      "\"Such disrespect will not be tolerated!\" wrote Trump. On his first day in office, Trump issued roughly 1,500 pardons to people who'd been charged in the Jan. 6, 2021, assault on the Capitol in which 140 law-enforcement officers were injured.",
      "About 300 guard members are currently in L.A., officials said, where they've been tasked with guarding federal properties."

    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 Bradley Bondi, the brother of Attorney General Pam Bondi, lost his bid for president of the D.C. Bar, receiving 3,490 votes compared with opponent Diane Seltzer\u2019s 34,982.",
      "Seltzer, an employment lawyer who ran a campaign focused on supporting members of the organization at a time of \u201cgovernmental chaos,\u201d said after the results were announced Monday that she credited the D.C. Bar's members with showing up and saying what kind of leader they wanted.",
      "\u201cWe've got to make sure that we hang on to the rule of law and that we can practice law safely,\u201d Seltzer told NBC News. \u201cThat we can represent who we want without worrying about retaliation, and that judges can issue fair and impartial rulings without worrying about being intimidated or retaliated against.\u201d",
      "The result came amid the Trump administration\u2019s attacks on judges who have ruled against its policies, as well as on law firms that have represented causes or clients President Donald Trump doesn\u2019t like. Last month, federal judges struck down Trump\u2019s executive orders against Jenner & Block and Perkins Coie, finding the orders unconstitutional.",
      "Seltzer acknowledged that the D.C. Bar had \u201cheavy\u201d issues on its plate. But she said she also wanted to create events that would build community, saying the association had a \u201cbright, vibrant, engaged, energetic\u201d group of members.",
      "Bondi did not immediately respond to a request for comment, but he said in a previous statement that he would \u201cvigilantly protect\u201d against any push to politicize the bar.",
      "Alicia Long, who served as deputy to former interim U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia Ed Martin, also lost her bid for treasurer of the D.C. Bar to Amanda Molina, although by a smaller margin than Bondi: 8,854 votes to 26,380.",
      "There were more than 89,000 D.C. Bar members eligible to vote, and turnout was at 43%. Seltzer\u2019s term will begin July 1.",
      "Bar associations can have enormous sway in the legal profession, with a role to play in who gets to be a lawyer \u2014 and who gets to stay a lawyer when misconduct allegations are involved. By virtue of its location, the D.C. Bar is where a significant number of federal attorneys are licensed.",
      "The Trump administration has also targeted the American Bar Association, with the Justice Department canceling grants the ABA used to provide assistance to lawyers and judges who work with domestic and sexual assault survivors. It also ended cooperation with the ABA\u2019s vetting of judicial nominees.",
      "The ABA, which is suing the Justice Department over the grant revocations, has said there are \u201cclear choices\u201d facing the profession and that it would \u201cnot stay silent in the face of efforts to remake the legal profession into something that rewards those who agree with the government and punishes those who do not.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "A Burmese American woman was eager to bring her siblings over to the U.S. from Myanmar amid a more than 15-year wait for visas. She\u2019d been hoping to reunite with them since the 1990s, during military rule in her home country, so her brother\u2019s family could start a life in the U.S. But a day after she bought the plane tickets, President Donald Trump ordered a travel ban that included Myanmar.",
      "The woman, 51, and her husband, who were granted anonymity due to fear of retaliation, had sponsored her brother and sister-in-law to immigrate to the U.S. The siblings were then were hoping to bring their own adult kids, too, so that they wouldn\u2019t have to fulfill mandatory military service in the country\u2019s active civil war.",
      "With the travel ban in effect Monday, they said the policy has a heightened impact on people from war-torn countries like Myanmar who had hopes of finding sanctuary in the U.S.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s really frustrating because we were on the cusp of securing their safety to leave that situation,\u201d said her husband, 57, adding he felt like a \u201crug got pulled out from under us in an instant.\u201d",
      "White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson said Trump\u2019s policy is in the \u201cbest interest of the American people and their safety.\u201d",
      "\u201cHis commonsense, country-specific travel restrictions include places that lack proper vetting, exhibit high visa overstay rates, or fail to share identity and threat information,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cThe restrictions fulfill the President\u2019s day one promise to protect American citizens from dangerous foreign actors who may come to the United States and cause us harm.\u201d",
      "The travel restrictions, announced on Wednesday, completely bar entry to the U.S. for people from Myanmar, formerly known as Burma, in addition to those from Afghanistan, the Republic of Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen. Other countries, including Cuba, Laos and Venezuela, are under partial travel restrictions.",
      "According to Trump\u2019s proclamation, several of the countries on the list had declined to accept the repatriation of their nationals while others had visa overstay rates that the administration deemed \u201cunacceptable.\u201d A few countries lacked \u201cthe competence of the central authority\u201d for issuing passports, the proclamation said.",
      "Jackson also pointed out a section in the proclamation that allows for applications for refugee status.",
      "\u201cNothing in this proclamation shall be construed to limit the ability of an individual to seek asylum, refugee status, withholding of removal, or protection under the [international Convention Against Torture], consistent with the laws of the United States,\u201d the proclamation said.",
      "However, after he took office, Trump limited refugee admissions for almost all countries including Myanmar. And in May, the Supreme Court allowed the Trump administration to revoke the temporary legal status of more than 500,000 immigrants that was granted by the Biden administration. Those immigrants came from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela and are now subject to deportation.",
      "Myanmar was among the nine countries in the latest proclamation that Trump also targeted during his first term. In fiscal year 2023, the U.S. issued 13,284 visas to the country, with business and tourism permits making up the most common types of visas. Myanmar recorded 1,384 overstays that fiscal year, equating to an overstay rate of almost 30%.",
      "The new travel ban comes as Myanmar\u2019s violent military regime fights to hold on to power after it seized control from the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi in a 2021 coup. Since then, violence has escalated across the region as the military clashes with ethnic minority rebel groups and pro-democracy militias.",
      "\u201cJunta forces have slaughtered thousands of civilians, bombed and burned villages, and displaced millions of people,\u201d Tom Andrews, United Nations special rapporteur on the human rights situation in Myanmar, said in a press release earlier this year. \u201cMore than 20,000 political prisoners remain behind bars. The economy and public services have collapsed. Famine and starvation loom over large parts of the population.\u201d",
      "Under the new travel ban, anyone who obtained a visa prior to the policy is still able to come to the U.S. But there\u2019s confusion over how the restrictions will be implemented and enforced. The Burmese American woman and her husband are among those with concerns, particularly as there have been several cases of lawful permanent residents and citizens being swept up in the dragnet of Trump\u2019s immigration policies.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s terrifying to think that they could be randomly picked up because somebody had a bad day at the office, or somebody didn\u2019t do their job or didn\u2019t believe that their visa was true,\u201d the woman's husband said. \u201cIt\u2019s quite frankly terrifying.\u201d",
      "For the woman, reunification with her brother has been a long time coming. She became a citizen in the late 1990s and began the process to help bring her sibling over a few years later. At the time, Myanmar had been under the control of a strict military junta that held power from the 1960s until 2011, and for decades had kept the country in a state of extreme isolation and deprivation. She said her brother, whose children were just a few years old then, hoped to come over and root his family in more stability.",
      "\u201cTheir circumstances in Myanmar at that time were very, very bad. That was the system that I grew up in. There was no future for them, no prosperity,\u201d the woman said. \u201cMy brother was concerned for his children\u2019s future and education.\u201d",
      "Amid moves and address changes, the couple said they never received the standard letter notifying them that the woman's brother had been able to progress in his visa process. They assumed the wait was a product of notorious immigration backlogs. It wasn\u2019t until the situation in Myanmar intensified again in recent years that the couple found out that the brother was close to finally being able to immigrate. But by then, the woman said, her brother\u2019s kids had aged out of the system.",
      "According to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, those who turn 21 before being approved for legal permanent resident status are no longer considered a child for immigration purposes and need to file an entirely new application, prolonging the green card process.",
      "At this point, the woman said, her brother and sister-in-law said they were willing to risk possible detention to come to the U.S., particularly if it meant easier access to the American immigration system that would enable them to fight to get their children to come over as well. However, with Myanmar\u2019s military draft in effect, the family is particularly concerned for their safety now that the travel ban adds another barrier to leaving.",
      "\u201cThe reason they wanted to come here was for their kids,\u201d the woman said of her brother and sister-in-law. \u201cNow, it\u2019s really hard to bring my nephews here to save their lives.\u201d",
      "Quyen Dinh, executive director of the Southeast Asia Resource Action Center, said the bans are ultimately another part of \u201cthe engine of Trump\u2019s mass deportation machine.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s focused on demonizing immigrant families and communities by denying them family reunification, that we all rightfully deserve to be whole \u2014 especially now, when the world is more dangerous than ever,\u201d Dinh said.",
      "Rather than protecting individuals\u2019 safety, Dinh said, she believes Trump\u2019s policy punishes those who need an escape from dangerous conditions.",
      "\u201cIt perpetuates the violence that is happening across the world, as opposed to creating conditions for peace or humanitarian relief, and for these families who\u2019ve been separated,\u201d Dinh said.",
      "She also said she views the ban as evidence that the U.S. is misunderstanding its role as a humanitarian leader.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve got people who are legitimately trying to escape a civil war,\u201d the woman's husband said. \u201cNow, because of some arbitrary decision by the Trump administration to pick a certain number of countries \u2026 without consideration of the actual cases, without an exception policy, it hurts them. They\u2019ve done nothing wrong.\u201d"

    "summary": "Glossip's twisting case saw him dodge death several times with nine separate execution dates that had to be postponed.",
    "story": [
      "Oklahoma's top prosecutor said Monday that the state intends to pursue a new murder trial against Richard Glossip but without the death penalty after the U.S. Supreme Court vacated his capital conviction in a rare victory for a death row prisoner.",
      "State Attorney General Gentner Drummond's decision to retry Glossip, 62, on a first-degree murder charge came out of a status conference hearing. Drummond said in a news release that the evidence still implicates Glossip in the 1997 murder of Oklahoma City motel owner Barry Van Treese.",
      "Glossip, a motel manager working for Van Treese, has maintained his innocence while on death row for almost three decades.",
      "While Drummond, a Republican, has not agreed with Glossip's innocence claims, he was supportive of the Supreme Court's ruling in February, when the majority of justices agreed, as Drummond put it, that \"it is now an undeniable fact that he did not receive a fair trial.\"",
      "Drummond said Monday that he would ensure Glossip now receives an impartial trial.",
      "\"While it was clear to me and to the U.S. Supreme Court that Mr. Glossip did not receive a fair trial, I have never proclaimed his innocence,\" Drummond said in a statement. \"After the high court remanded the matter back to district court, my office thoroughly reviewed the merits of the case against Richard Glossip and concluded that sufficient evidence exists to secure a murder conviction.\"",
      "Oklahoma County District Attorney Vicki Behenna, a Democrat, had previously indicated that Glossip would\u00a0not be eligible\u00a0for the death penalty now if he were to be retried.",
      "Drummond said he would seek a life sentence for Glossip at his next trial.",
      "\"While I cannot go back 25 years and handle the case in the proper way that would have ensured true justice, I still have a duty to seek the justice that is available today,\" he added.",
      "The continuation of the state's prosecution against Glossip resumes a twisting case that saw him dodge death several times with nine separate execution dates that had to be postponed. Various courts delayed the executions as he appealed, while state corrections officials also came under scrutiny a decade ago for botched execution attempts.",
      "But Glossip's case had been championed in recent years by a bipartisan group of Oklahoma legislators after an independent report they commissioned in 2022 found that \"no reasonable jury hearing the complete record would convict Glossip of first-degree murder.\"",
      "The report centered on the state's primary witness, Justin Sneed, who had confirmed to the report's investigators that he had discussions with multiple family members about \"recanting\" his testimony over an 11-year period. Investigators also said the district attorney's case file included documentation describing how the state provided Sneed information \"so he could conform his testimony to match the evidence\" from other witnesses.",
      "Glossip's original 1998 conviction was overturned in 2001, when a state appeals court found that the evidence against him was weak. But the state took him to trial again, and a second jury found him guilty in 2004.",
      "At Glossip's trial, Sneed, a motel handyman, admitted that he had killed Van Treese, but said that it was at Glossip's direction and that he had been promised $10,000. In exchange for testifying against Glossip, Sneed received a life sentence while Glossip was given the death penalty.",
      "Prosecutors said Glossip orchestrated the plot because he was embezzling from the motel and feared being fired.",
      "The Supreme Court on Monday tossed out Glossip's capital conviction in a 5-3 ruling. Justice Neil Gorsuch did not participate, presumably because he was involved in the case when he was on a federal appeals court that includes Oklahoma.",
      "Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote in the majority's ruling that prosecutors \"knew Sneed's statements were false\" and that \"because Sneed's testimony was the only direct evidence of Glossip's guilt of capital murder, the jury's assessment of Sneed's credibility was necessarily determinative here.\"",
      "\"Hence, there is a reasonable likelihood that correcting Sneed's testimony would have affected the judgment of the jury,\" she added.",
      "After the Supreme Court's decision, Glossip was moved off death row, but was held without bail in the Oklahoma County Detention Center on a first-degree murder charge.",
      "A next court date in Glossip's case is scheduled for June 17.",
      "Glossip's attorney, Don Knight, did not immediately comment about the prosecutors' decision, but he welcomed the Supreme Court's ruling in February that spared his longtime client from the death chamber.",
      "\"He had nine execution dates, three last meals, and obviously, to finally get relief has been huge for him,\" Knight said, \"and he's thrilled beyond words.\""

      "\u201cThe first one, I felt a little bit more shock immediately after the match,\u201d she said. \u201cThis one I just really felt deep down like it was meant to be, that I wanted to do it, and I could do it. So I think this one was more just proud than relief.\u201d",
      "Sabalenka initially drew controversy with her post-match remarks to reporters that Gauff only won the match \u201cnot because she played incredible, just because I made all of those mistakes.\u201d",
      "She then issued a statement on her Instagram story on Sunday.",

      "On June 9, Judge Lewis J. Liman of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York granted a motion to dismiss the lawsuit filed by the Wayfarer Parties, which includes Baldoni, accusing Lively, Reynolds and their publicist, Leslie Sloane, of defamation and extortion after Lively filed a sexual harassment complaint against Baldoni, according to court documents obtained by TODAY.com.",
      "Baldoni's team also sued The New York Times for libel over an article published about Lively's sexual harassment complaint against Baldoni in December 2024.",
      "In the opinion section of his dismissal, Judge Liman said Baldoni and Wayfarer Parties \"have not alleged that Lively is responsible for any statements other than the statements in her CRD complaint, which are privileged.\"",
      "\u201cThe Wayfarer Parties have alleged that Reynolds and Sloane made additional statements accusing Baldoni of sexual misconduct and that the Times made additional statements accusing the Wayfarer Parties of engaging in a smear campaign,\u201d the judge wrote. \u201cBut the Wayfarer Parties have not alleged that Reynolds, Sloane or the Times would have seriously doubted these statements were true based on the information available to them, as is required for them to be liable for defamation under applicable law.\u201d",
      "Judge Liman added, \"Even if they turn out to be unneeded, an employee can insist on protections at workplace for sexual harassment without being accused of extortion. If an employer accedes, it cannot later claim to be a victim of the employee\u2019s wrongful threats.\u201d",
      "The judge is permitting Baldoni's team to resubmit an amended complaint against Lively, Reynolds, publicist Leslie Sloan and The New York Times for their contract-related claims by June 23. The civil extortion and defamation claims were dismissed with prejudice and cannot be resubmitted.",
      "Lively's lawyers Esra Hudson and Mike Gottlieb celebrated Judge Liman's dismissal of Baldoni's countersuit, claiming a \"complete vindication\" for their clients.",
      "\u201cToday\u2019s opinion is a total victory and a complete vindication for Blake Lively, along with those that Justin Baldoni and the Wayfarer Parties dragged into their retaliatory lawsuit, including Ryan Reynolds, Leslie Sloane and The New York Times,\u201d they told TODAY.com in a statement.",
      "\u201cAs we have said from day one, this \u2018$400 million\u2019 lawsuit was a sham, and the Court saw right through it. We look forward to the next round, which is seeking attorneys\u2019 fees, treble damages and punitive damages against Baldoni, Sarowitz, Nathan, and the other Wayfarer Parties who perpetrated this abusive litigation,\u201d they added.",
      "TODAY.com has reached out to attorneys for Baldoni for comment.",
      "Lively and Baldoni's legal woes began in December 2024 when Lively filed her sexual harassment complaint against Baldoni for his alleged behavior on the set of \"It Ends with Us,\" which was primarily shot in New Jersey.",
      "Since then, the high-profile case has been filled with legal twists and turns that would be at home in a Hollywood courtroom drama.",
      "After Baldoni sued The New York Times in December 2024 for the newspaper's story about Lively's complaint, Lively initiated litigation against Baldoni the same month in a federal court in New York.",
      "In January 2024, Baldoni sued Lively for defamation. The following month, the actor and director launched a website about his lawsuit with Lively that included text messages between the two stars as well as between Baldoni and Reynolds.",
      "In February, Lively amended her sexual harassment complaint to suggest she wasn't the only one on the \"It Ends with Us\" set to accuse Baldoni of misconduct.",
      "The case is set to go to trial on March 9, 2026."

      "But everything didn\u2019t go according to plan, Ellis told TODAY\u2019s Jenna Bush Hager on June 9 \u2014 he ended up carrying the ring around for days before Senicar said yes.",
      "\"Mine was horrible. It was ... sorry, baby,\" Ellis jokingly said to his wife about his proposal. \"But basically, I knew I was proposing. We were on vacation. We were in Bali. I had the ring with me. I took it everywhere with me. I kept it in my backpack, as we were like, adventuring around Bali, and I didn't know what day I was going to do it.\"",
      "Ellis first planned to propose on Dec. 31 in honor of New Year's Eve, but the pair ended up getting sick. So, his plan was nixed while they spent the next two days knocked out and lying around the house, but it led him to another idea.",
      "\"I decide, 'Hey, we should go scuba diving, and I'll propose underwater.'\" he recalled to Jenna.",
      "\"Now I want to back up and say that I was in the middle of filming 'Top Gun' when this happened, and I had pitched this to my castmates and Monica Barbaro's like, 'That is the stupidest idea I've ever heard. The first thing people want to do when they engage is kiss! You're going to be underwater. What are you going to do?' She was right,\" he added",
      "Ellis added that his wife doesn't scuba dive, or really even swim underwater, so he just continued to carry the ring around with him, waiting for a good moment.",
      "\"The next day, we're at a coffee shop, and I'm actually sending some emails about something, doing some work stuff. And she's like, 'I just thought we were gonna have a trip without work. I thought we were just going to be here together. I thought it was just going to be me and you,'\" he said.",
      "\"And I reach in my backpack, and I'm like, 'Is this what you want?' And she goes, 'No! You will not propose to me like this!' So I stuffed ... the ring back in the bag, and somehow, we have a beautiful day,\" he continued.",
      "And about 24 hours later, the pair were watching the sun go down on a beach, recommended to him by his castmate Miles Teller.",
      "\"I'm just like panicking, freaking out and she turns and she like looks away to look at the sunset, and as she looks, I reach in my bag and I pull it out and she turns around and I say, 'Can we do this again? Will you marry me?' And that was it,\" he said.",
      "Jenna was delighted by the story: \"See? Even bad proposals end up OK! We all have them.\"",
      "Ellis and Senicar tied the knot in 2022 and share two children together: Nora Grace and Noa Gray."

      "The reality star alludes to the incident in a new \"Sister Wives: One on One\" special while speaking with host Sukanya Krishnan.",
      "The topic comes up after one of Kody's ex-wives Christine Brown Woolley tells Krishnan how she and her other sister wives weren't typically physically affectionate with Kody Brown in front of each other, calling it an \"unspoken (rule).\"",
      "The father of 18 then addresses the topic and shares his own side of the story.",
      "\"The last time Robyn and I showed PDA with the family, we got kicked out,\" he says.",
      "\"You got kicked out?\" the host asks.",
      "Kody Brown seems hesitant to elaborate on the situation, saying, \"I\u2019m not going there. Yeah, they f----- with us bad. And boy, it cost me dearly.\"",
      "Krishnan then prompts the reality star to share additional details, but he declines.",
      "\"It\u2019s a story that just cannot be told. Yeah. It\u2019s just, (when) there\u2019s something so vitally detrimental to your life, you\u2019re just not going to talk about it,\" he says.",
      "When asked if the incident occurred recently, Kody Brown shuts Krishnan down once again, saying, \"Let\u2019s just not talk about it.\"",
      "The host is able to get a bit more insight when she asks if the situation was really \"that traumatizing.\"",
      "\"Until Meri and Janelle are remarried, I will not show PDA to Robyn in front of them,\" he says.",
      "Krishnan asks Kody Brown if he means he won't show PDA to his wife in public or when his ex-wives are around.",
      "\"No, no, it\u2019s where we are safe, we behave candidly. And where we are not, we have learned to be careful. Because when true love is exposed, it calls down wrath,\" he says. \"And it\u2019s like the world hates true love so much that they want to be really, really crappy about it.\"",
      "Kody Brown ends by saying his happy relationship with Robyn Brown hasn't always come easily.",
      "\"So it\u2019s been a painful experience falling in love \u2014 not from the person I fell in love with, but from the world outside of it,\" he says.",
      "Later in the episode, Robyn Brown admits that she and her husband have different views of PDA.",
      "\"What I think is affection, he thinks is subtle. It\u2019s just a difference between his level and my level. And I mean, I think kissing is fine in front of people,\" she says. \"I\u2019m a little shy about like a full makeout session, that\u2019s all, where you\u2019re seeing spit and tongue swapping.\"",
      "Krishnan doesn't ask Meri Brown about Kody Brown's claims directly, but the reality star does address the topic of PDA and explains what her comfort level is.",
      "\"I think there\u2019s a limit. I don\u2019t have a problem with PDA. I think that I want to have somebody who is comfortable with that,\" she says.",
      "Meri Brown goes on to say she's comfortable with holding hands, hugging, putting your arms around each other and a kiss here and there.",
      "\"But when it gets to the point that somebody says, 'Get a room,' that\u2019s probably a little bit too much,\" she adds.",
      "When asked if she ever felt uncomfortable when her husband would exhibit PDA with his other wives, Meri Brown offers the following response.",
      "\"It was always uncomfortable and awkward. It still is. Now when I see it with him and Robyn, it\u2019s like, because I feel like now it\u2019s almost like I\u2019m throwing it in your face and I don\u2019t like that. Don\u2019t throw it in my face,\" she says. \"Just be you. Love her the best that you can, but don\u2019t be a jerk to me about it.\"",
      "Robyn Brown then chimes in during her own interview with Krishnan and says she always found the family's guidelines about limited PDA \"really weird\" when she first met Kody Brown.",
      "\"I was told I didn\u2019t have a say. I was told that I needed to conform to what they were doing, and I was trying really hard not to, you know, rock the boat too,\" she says, adding that she preferred not to name names when asked who told her that."

    "story": [
      "Benicio del Toro was almost at a loss for words after Academy Award-winning director Wes Anderson asked him to be in his new movie, \"The Phoenician Scheme.\"",
      "On the June 8 episode of Sunday Sitdown with Willie Geist, del Toro recalled his conversation with Anderson, telling Geist, \"He said, 'I want you to be part of my next film.'\" He never said, 'I\u2019m writing something for you.'\"",
      "\"That would have scared the hell out of me,\" del Toro quips.",
      "\"It still scared the hell out of me when I read the script, because I thought it was fantastic and it was a lot of heavy lifting,\" he continued. \"Because f---, I\u2019m in it quite a bit. But when you get Wes Anderson calling you and offering you any part \u2014 but in this case, a hell of a part, it\u2019s like getting a motivational pill. You\u2019re just motivated.\"",
      "In \u201cThe Phoenician Scheme,\" del Toro plays Zsa-zsa Korda, a wealthy businessman, who has cheated death far too many times. Realizing that one day he might not be able to make it out alive, he decides to appoint his only daughter Liesel (Mia Threapleton), as his successor and finally complete his long-awaited project \u2014 the Korda Land and Sea Phoenician Infrastructure Scheme.",
      "When asked what it felt like to be the leading man in a Wes Anderson flick, del Toro said \"there\u2019s room for wiggling\" and \"room for doin\u2019 your thing within his.\"",
      "\"When you work with Wes, you trust him,\" he added.",
      "\u201cThe Phoenician Scheme\" is not the only movie that del Toro and Anderson have done together. In 2021, the pair teamed up for Anderson's film \"The French Dispatch,\" where del Toro played Moses Rosenthaler, a renowned artist serving life in prison for murder.",
      "\"How do you describe being inside the world of Wes Anderson?\" Geist asked.",
      "\"I got to be in the moment. Wes wants you to be as honest as you can be, like any other director,\" he said. \"I think Wes Anderson movies, when I see them \u2014 and I\u2019ve been in two \u2014 they feel like they\u2019re 3D, like they\u2019re almost tactile media. You almost can touch it, like a pop-up book in some ways. And also the humor and the heart.\"",
      "\u201cThe Phoenician Scheme,\u201d which hit theaters on May 30, featured a star-studded cast including Michael Cera, Scarlett Johansson, Tom Hanks, among others. It also starred Threapleton, who is the daughter of Academy Award winner Kate Winslet.",
      "Del Toro talked about how he auditioned Threapleton for the role of his nun daughter.",
      "\"She was the top contender. We were doin\u2019 the scene, and then we finished, and I locked eyes with her, and she locked eyes with me, and she didn\u2019t blink,\" he recalled. \"And then we went on. And then I remember telling Wes, you know, 'I think that\u2019s exactly what Zsa-zsa needs.'\""

    "summary": "Is Georgia pregnant on Ginny and Georgia? Who is the father? Here are the 2 possibilities and why Joe or Paul could be the father of Georgia's baby.",
    "story": [
      "After being acquitted of murder charges, Georgia Miller is ready for a fresh start in the Season 3 finale of \"Ginny & Georgia.\" But it appears that fate isn't quite done tossing curveballs at the Mayoress Murderess just yet.",
      "In an ironic twist of fate, Georgia (Brianne Howey) leaves her daughter Ginny (Antonia Gentry) and viewers alike wondering if she's pregnant in the very last scene of the action-packed finale. Then there's the lingering question of who the father could be.",
      "It's a wild plot twist, especially given the fact that Georgia just faked a pregnancy earlier in the season.",
      "As viewers eagerly await Season 4 of the Netflix series (yes, it's already been renewed!), we're diving into the shocking cliffhanger that has fans buzzing.",
      "Why Georgia's fake pregnancy is key to this plot twist",
      "To understand the irony behind this pregnancy mystery, let's take a step back and recall how Georgia ended up faking a pregnancy during Season 3 to convince her husband Paul (Scott Porter) to show up to court for her.",
      "Throughout the season, Georgia was on trial for allegedly murdering Cynthia Fuller's husband Tom Fuller, who was in hospice care at home. Georgia was indeed guilty, but thought of it as a mercy killing since Tom was suffering and Cynthia and her son were miserable watching him slip away.",
      "As more dirt from Georgia's past (which includes multiple murders) comes to light during the trial, Paul loses faith in his wife and moves out.",
      "When Georgia's daughter Ginny gets pregnant and subsequently gets an abortion, Georgia devises a plan to make Paul stick around and support her in court. After all, his status as the town's mayor is a great feather in her cap and his presence in court could help sway public opinion.",
      "To put her plan in motion, Georgia shows Paul Ginny's positive pregnancy test and says the child is hers. While talking with Ginny's father Zion (Nathan Mitchell) one day, Paul suspects that Ginny might have gotten an abortion when Zion alludes to a difficult situation his daughter recently went through. Paul then confronts Georgia and realizes she was faking the pregnancy all along.",
      "Is Georgia really pregnant this time?",
      "In the very last scene of the Season 3 finale, Georgia enters her kitchen and starts drinking milk right from the bottle. Ginny then addresses her mother, saying, \u201cMom, didn't you say you drink milk when you're pregnant?\"",
      "Georgia looks at the bottle with wide eyes and Ginny takes a deep breath as the show rolls into the credits and plays a lullaby.",
      "Earlier on, Georgia had also taken one sip of wine when she got acquitted of murder then dumped the rest of the glass into the sink, only further suggesting that she could be pregnant.",
      "Who could the father of Georgia's child be?",
      "If Georgia really is pregnant, she'll now need to figure out who the father is. After all, she recently slept with Paul after he moved home temporarily (ya know, when she faked a pregnancy), so he's a contender.",
      "Then there's Joe (Raymond Ablack), who has admired Georgia for years but only recently made his move when she was ready to skip town.",
      "Joe stops by Georgia's house to check on her after watching a press conference where Paul said he was divorcing his wife. After telling Joe that she was running away to avoid prison time, Georgia kisses him. Ever the gentleman, Joe seems hesitant to get physical while Georgia is so emotionally distraught, but one thing leads to another and they start ripping their clothes off.",
      "One night, Paul is at Joe's caf\u00e9 venting about Georgia and lets it slip that he was going to stay with his wife after learning she was pregnant. This comes as news to Joe, who is curious to know when Paul and Georgia slept together.",
      "After Georgia is exonerated, Joe visits her and she fesses up about all the murders she's committed, telling him she feels \"safe\" with him. They start kissing again and then she stops, saying her children need her to settle down for a bit since she promised Ginny she'd be different. They then share a hug.",
      "If Georgia is indeed pregnant, the paternity of her child will be in question in Season 4.",
      "While speaking with TODAY.com, Howey teased the upcoming season, saying, \u201cIt\u2019s going to get messy. And on this show, nothing is ever simple.\u201d"

      "The ban, which goes into effect Monday, has led to widespread uncertainty for many and drawn condemnation from international leaders. The proclamation issued Tuesday offered exceptions for those who are lawful permanent U.S. residents and those traveling to the U.S. for the World Cup and the Olympics, among other examples. No such mention was made for cases of medical necessity, such as those who are seeking treatment in the U.S. through the International Cardiac Alliance.",
      "The International Cardiac Alliance\u2019s total waitlist for Haitians, ranging from infants to young adults, totals at least 316 people who need heart surgery, said Executive Director Owen Robinson.

      "Some of the children in the program travel directly from their home country to the U.S., undergo surgery, and then return to Haiti. But for many Haitians, international travel requires multiple levels of logistical wrangling, Robinson said. Some patients and their parents who can secure surgeries in other countries must apply for a visa to the U.S., travel here, and then head to their eventual destination. The United States\u2019 travel ban now throws a wrench in that process.",

The \u201cbad news\u201d he received about the travel ban causing the postponement or potential cancellation of his daughter\u2019s travel through the U.S. to the Dominican Republic is \u201creally disturbing and breaking my heart,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cI was not waiting to hear something like that,\u201d Rene, 53, said in Creole through a translator. \u201cWe know for sure that there is nowhere in Haiti we can have this possibility. The only option that we have was just waiting to have an open door from the Cardiac Alliance.\u201d",
      "He also said the news will be troubling for his family to hear and that they don\u2019t know \u201cwhere they will find another open door that can give her a chance.\u201d",
      "Robinson said the U.S. Embassy in Haiti recently informed him that it most likely wouldn\u2019t be able to issue any visas due to the travel ban. In the past, the embassy has repeatedly issued visas for Haitian children to travel to the U.S. for care. The office of Rep. Becca Balint, D-Vt., has offered to reach out to the State Department to see if the children can receive exceptions, he added.",
      "Dr. John Clark, a pediatric cardiologist at Akron Children\u2019s Hospital in Ohio who has worked with the ICA, said many children in impoverished countries like Haiti suffer from Fabienne\u2019s condition because they are not seen by a doctor and treated for the common illness strep throat. Untreated, recurring strep infections can lead to rheumatic heart disease.",
      "St. Damien Pediatric Hospital in Port-au-Prince received visiting pediatric surgical teams from 2015 to 2019, Robinson said. Now, dangerous conditions in Haiti prevent doctors from other countries from entering or providing care. Meanwhile, Haiti does not have enough doctors practicing there, and the loss of opportunities for a medical education in Haiti only perpetuates the problem, Clark said.",
      "Clark participated in a surgical mission there in 2019, when visiting U.S. doctors were performing two heart surgeries per day, he said. A drastic rise in gang violence \u2014 including an attack on one of the hospital\u2019s ambulances and a worker being stoned to death \u2014 ended most medical missions to Haiti.",
      "Gang violence has only escalated since then, United Nations figures show, particularly after the assassination of Haiti\u2019s President Jovenel Mo\u00efse in 2021. Haiti is one of the poorest countries in the world, and more than half of Haitians live below the poverty line. The country is also plagued with government corruption, gang violence and food insecurity, as well as vulnerability to natural disasters, including a devastating 2010 earthquake that killed at least 220,000 people. Lack of adequate health care also fuels diseases like cholera, according to the Council on Foreign Relations.",
      "\u201cI hope things can calm down one day enough that we can get back there [to Haiti],\u201d Clark said. \u201cBut right now, there\u2019s no way for us to go back down.\u201d",
      "Andrice Boncoeur of Port-au-Prince received free open-heart surgery at CEDIMAT Cardiovascular Center in the Dominican Republic to repair a valve when he was 9 years old. That procedure, however, was only meant to be a temporary solution. Now, plans for Andrice, 16, to travel through the U.S. for more permanent surgery have been disrupted.",
      "On Thursday, Andrice\u2019s father, Andre Boncoeur, said he had not yet told his son about the travel ban preventing him from passing through the U.S. Boncoeur said he knows \u201csomething can change at any time.\u201d",
      "Still, children like Andrice do not have much time to wait. In April, Andrice was once again hospitalized for three days at Haiti\u2019s Centre Hospitalier Eben-Ezer for heart failure. Boncoeur said his family has spent \u201ceverything that we had\u201d and that their funds are \u201calmost gone.\u201d He said he hopes the situation will change so that his son, who aspires to become a pastor, \u201ccan have a chance to live his life as a normal kid.\u201d",
      "Clark, Robinson and the patient\u2019s parents all agree it comes down to the Trump administration\u2019s willingness to accommodate the sick children.",
      "\u201cThese children are somebody\u2019s child and somebody\u2019s grandchild  and they don\u2019t have access to lifesaving care,\u201d Clark said. \u201cIs there any room for compassion?\u201d"

    "story": [
      "LONDON \u2014 Washington\u2019s European allies must make a \u201cquantum leap\u201d in military spending to deter Russia, the head of NATO said Monday, calling for a 400% increase in the Continent\u2019s air and missile defense budget.",
      "NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte\u2019s comments are among the strongest yet from the organization as it attempts to improve Europe\u2019s insufficient defenses against Russia while also avoiding the political ire of President Donald Trump.",
      "\u201cThe fact is, we need a quantum leap in our collective defense,\u201d Rutte said at London-based think tank Chatham House. \u201cThe fact is, we must have more forces and capabilities to implement our defense plans in full. The fact is, danger will not disappear even when the war in Ukraine ends.\u201d",
      "Trump's clear signaling that he would like to at least significantly reduce decades of American military support for Europe has sent its nations scrambling to beef up their own arms industries.",
      "Trump's call for NATO allies to up their minimum defense spending from 2% to 5% of GDP was once seen as outlandish; but last month Rutte too backed this idea and said he expected it to be adopted at NATO's June 24-25 summit.",
      "On Monday he made a similarly ambitious call. He asked for a \u201c400% increase in air and missile defense\u201d and added that \u201cmilitaries also need thousands more armored vehicles and tanks, millions more artillery shells, and we must double our enabling capabilities, such as logistics, supply, transportation, and medical support.\u201d",
      "\u201cWishful thinking will not keep us safe,\u201d he said. \u201cWe cannot dream away the danger. Hope is not a strategy. So NATO has to become a stronger, fairer and more lethal alliance.\u201d",
      "Rutte's speech comes against the backdrop of European powers vowing to spend more on their military budgets, having relied for decades upon America's protection first against the Soviet Union and now Putin's revanchist Kremlin.",
      "NATO's constituents must also maintain a balancing act when it comes to Ukraine, which is not a member. Kyiv's allies want to support a neighbor it sees as a bulwark against Russian aggression, while keeping onside a White House increasingly sympathetic to Moscow's worldview.",
      "Trump has described his \u201cvery, very good relationship\u201d with Putin, a man considered a pariah by former President Joe Biden and other Western leaders.",
      "Many officials and analysts in Europe acknowledge that Trump is right to demand that wealthy nations such as Germany be able to look after themselves without Washington's help.",
      "However, many of these same commentators have expressed their horror at the tactics used by Trump, who has suggested that the United States would not protect underpaying allies and openly invited Russia to \u201cdo whatever the hell\u201d it wants to them.",
      "That risks shattering the central premise of NATO: Article 5 of its founding charter \u2014 an \u201call-for-one and one-for-all\u201d mutual defense promise suggesting that if one ally is attacked, the rest would come to its aid.",
      "The scenario the founders had in mind was that the U.S. would join the fight if Russia decided to launch an act of aggression against a smaller European country. In practice, however, the only time it has been used in the real world was the other way round, when the alliance lent Washington symbolic defensive help after 9/11.",
      "Previous American presidents have always seen this as a good trade off: America underwrites European security, and in return has a huge influence over political, diplomatic and even cultural happenings on the continent and beyond. The soft power return on investment was always seen as a profitable one.",
      "However, Trump has repeatedly questioned this logic, not only undermining the promise behind Article 5 but using hostile language against those historically considered Western brethren.",
      "The realization among European allies that Washington is no longer committed to its mutual defense has sparked a drive to push up defense budgets and revive the long-since dormant arms industry on the continent."

      "The third U.N. Ocean Conference opens Monday, with Britain's Prince William among those raising the pressure on nations to turn decades of promises into real protection for the sea.",
      "The summit comes as just 2.7% of the ocean is effectively protected from destructive extractive activities, according to the nonprofit Marine Conservation Institute. That is far below the target agreed under the \u201c30x30\u201d pledge to conserve 30% of land and sea by 2030.",
      "Atop this year\u2019s agenda is ratification of the High Seas Treaty. Adopted in 2023, the treaty would for the first time allow nations to establish marine protected areas in international waters, which cover nearly two-thirds of the ocean and are largely ungoverned.",
      "Speaking ahead of the conference, Britain's Prince William said Sunday that rising sea temperatures, plastic pollution and overfishing were putting pressure on fragile ecosystems and the people who depend on them.",
      "\u201cWhat once seemed an abundant resource is diminishing before our eyes,\u201d William, heir to the British throne, told the Blue Economy and Finance Forum in Monaco. He described the challenge as being \u201clike none we have faced before\u201d.",
      "\u201cPut simply: the ocean is under enormous threat, but it can revive itself. But, only if together, we act now,\u201d he told the meeting of investors and policymakers.",
      "Mauro Randone, regional projects manager at the World Wildlife Fund\u2019s Mediterranean Marine Initiative, said that \u201cit\u2019s the Wild West out there with countries just fishing anywhere without any sort of regulation, and that needs to change.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe high seas belong to everyone and no one practically at the same time, and countries are finally committing to establish some rules,\u201d he added.",
      "The ocean is critical in stabilizing Earth\u2019s climate and sustaining life. It generates 50% of the oxygen we breathe, absorbs around 30% of carbon dioxide emissions and captures more than 90% of the excess heat caused by those emissions. Without a healthy ocean, experts warn, climate goals will remain out of reach.",
      "The treaty will only come into force once 60 countries ratify it. As of Monday, just 32 countries had. Advocates hope UNOC can build enough momentum to cross the threshold, which would allow for the first official Oceans Conference of Parties.",
      "\u201cTwo-thirds of the ocean is areas beyond national jurisdiction \u2014 that\u2019s half our planet,\u201d said Minna Epps, director of global ocean policy at the International Union for Conservation of Nature. \u201cWe cannot possibly protect 30% of the ocean if it doesn\u2019t include the high seas.\u201d",
      "South Korea, France and the European Union have championed the treaty, but most large ocean nations have yet to ratify it, including the rest of the G20. Thousands of attendees are expected in Nice, from delegates and heads of state to scientists and industry leaders. The United States has yet to confirm a formal delegation.",
      "Beyond new commitments, the conference highlights the growing gap between marine protection declarations and real-world conservation.",
      "France, the conference co-host, claims to have surpassed the 30% target for marine protection. But environmental groups say only 3% of French waters are fully protected from harmful activities such as bottom trawling and industrial fishing.",
      "\u201cThe government declares these as protected areas, but this is a lie,\u201d said Enric Sala, founder of the National Geographic Pristine Seas marine reserve project. \u201cMost of it is political box-ticking. It\u2019s all paper parks.\u201d",
      "That criticism is echoed across the continent. A new World Wildlife Fund report found that although more than 11% of Europe\u2019s marine area is designated for protection, just 2% of E.U. waters have management plans in place.",
      "Fabien Boileau, director of marine protected areas at France\u2019s Office for Biodiversity, acknowledged the presence of bottom trawling in French protected areas, but said it was part of a phased strategy.",
      "\u201cIn France, we made the choice to designate large marine protected areas with relatively low levels of regulation at first, betting that stronger protections would be developed over time through local governance,\u201d he said. \u201cToday, we\u2019re gradually increasing the number of zones with stricter protections within those areas.\u201d",
      "Advocates say industrial fishing lobbies continue to resist stricter protections, despite evidence that well-managed reserves boost long-term fisheries through the \u201cspillover effect,\u201d whereby marine life flourishes in nearby waters.",
      "\u201cProtection is not the problem \u2014 overfishing is the problem,\u201d Sala said. \u201cThe worst enemy of the fishing industry is themselves.\u201d",
      "The conference will feature 10 panels on topics such as blue finance, sustainable fisheries and plastic pollution. Deep sea mining is expected to feature in broader discussions, while small island states are likely to use the platform to advocate for increased climate adaptation funding.",
      "The outcome of these discussions will form the basis of the Nice Ocean Action Plan, a declaration of voluntary commitments to be adopted by consensus and presented at the United Nations in New York this July.",
      "\u201cThere cannot be a healthy planet without a healthy ocean,\u201d said Peter Thomson, U.N. special envoy for the ocean. \u201cIt\u2019s urgent business for us all.\u201d"

      "The tattoos covering Iranian rapper Tataloo\u2019s face stand out against the gray prison uniform the 37-year-old now wears as he awaits execution, his own rise and fall tracing the chaos of the last decade of Iranian politics.",
      "Tataloo, whose full name is Amir Hossein Maghsoudloo, faces a death sentence after being convicted on charges of \u201cinsulting Islamic sanctities.\u201d It\u2019s a far cry from when he once supported a hard-line Iranian presidential candidate.",
      "Tataloo\u2019s music became popular among the Islamic Republic\u2019s youth, as it challenged Iran\u2019s theocracy at a time when opposition to the country\u2019s government was splintered and largely leaderless.",
      "The rapper\u2019s lyrics became increasingly political after the 2022 death of Mahsa Amini and the subsequent wave of nationwide protests. He also appeared in music videos which criticized the authorities.",
      "\u201cWhen you show your face in a music video, you are saying, \u2018Hey, I\u2019m here, and I don\u2019t care about your restrictions,\u2019\u201d said Ali Hamedani, a former BBC journalist who interviewed the rapper in 2005. \u201cThat was brave.\u201d",
      "The Iranian Supreme Court last month upheld his death sentence.",
      "\u201cThis ruling has now been confirmed and is ready for execution,\u201d judiciary spokesman Asghar Jahangir told reporters at a press conference last month.",
      "Activists have decried his looming execution and expressed concern for his safety after he reportedly tried to kill himself in prison.",
      "Tataloo began his music career in 2003 as part of an underground genre of Iranian music that combines Western styles of rap, rhythm-and-blues and rock with Farsi lyrics. His first album, released in 2011, polarized audiences, though he never played publicly in Iran, where its Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance controls all concerts.",
      "Tataloo appeared in a 2015 music video backing Iran\u2019s paramilitary Revolutionary Guard and Tehran\u2019s nuclear program, which long has been targeted by the West over fears it could allow the Islamic Republic to develop an atomic bomb. While he never discussed the motivation behind this, it appeared that the rapper had hoped to win favor with the theocracy or perhaps have a travel ban against him lifted.",
      "In the video for \u201cEnergy Hasteei,\u201d or \u201cNuclear Energy,\u201d Tataloo sings a power ballad in front of rifle-wielding guardsmen and later aboard the Iranian frigate Damavand in the Caspian Sea. The ship later sank during a storm in 2018.",
      "\u201cThis is our absolute right: To have an armed Persian Gulf,\u201d Tataloo sang.",
      "Tataloo even issued an endorsement for hard-liner Ebrahim Raisi in 2017. That year, the two sat for a televised appearance as part of Raisi\u2019s failed presidential campaign against the relative moderate Hassan Rouhani. Raisi later won the presidency in 2021, but was killed in a helicopter crash in 2024.",
      "Fame in Turkey, prison back in Iran",
      "In 2018, Tataloo \u2014 who faced legal problems in Iran \u2014 was allowed to leave the country for Turkey, where many Persian singers and performers stage lucrative concerts.",
      "Tataloo hosted live video sessions as he rose to fame on social media, where he became well-known for his tattoos covering his face and body. Among them are an Iranian flag and an image of his mother next to a key and heart.",
      "Instagram deactivated his account in 2020 after he called for underage girls to join his \u201cteam\u201d for sex. He also acknowledged taking drugs.",
      "\u201cDespite being a controversial rapper, Tataloo has quite the fanbase in Iran, known as \u2018Tatalities,\u2019\u201d said Holly Dagres, a senior fellow at the Washington Institute for Near-East Policy. \u201cOver the years, they\u2019ve flooded social media with messages of solidarity for him and even campaigned for the rapper\u2019s release in the past when he was detained on separate charges.\u201d",
      "Tataloo\u2019s rebellious music struck a chord with disenfranchised young people in Iran as they struggled to find work, get married and start their adult lives. He also increasingly challenged Iran\u2019s theocracy in his lyrics, particularly after the death of Amini following her arrest over allegedly not wearing the hijab to the liking of authorities.",
      "His collaboration \u201cEnghelab Solh\u201d \u2014 \u201cPeace Revolution\u201d in Farsi \u2014 called out Iran\u2019s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei by name.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t want tear gas, because there are tears in everyone\u2019s eyes,\u201d he rapped.",
      "But the music stopped for Tataloo in late 2023. He was deported from Turkey after his passport had expired, and was immediately taken into custody upon arrival to Iran.",
      "Death sentence draws protests",
      "Tehran\u2019s Criminal Court initially handed Tataloo a five-year sentence for blasphemy. Iran\u2019s Supreme Court threw out the decision and sent his case to another court, which sentenced him to death in January. The rapper already faced ten years in prison for a string of separate convictions, including promoting prostitution and moral corruption.",
      "\u201cTataloo is at serious risk of execution,\u201d Mahmood Amiry-Moghaddam, the director of advocacy group Iran Human Rights, said in a statement. \u201cThe international community, artists and the public must act to stop his execution.\u201d",
      "Tataloo earlier expressed remorse at a trial.",

      "As Western influence in the region has waned, Russia has sought to step into the vacuum, sweeping in with offers of assistance. Moscow initially expanded its military cooperation with African nations by using the Wagner Group of mercenaries. But since the group\u2019s leader, Yevgeny Prigozhin, was killed in a plane crash in 2023, after mounting a brief armed rebellion in Russia that challenged the rule of President Vladimir Putin, Moscow has been developing the Africa Corps as a rival force to Wagner.",

They are still holding 55 hostages, around a third of them believed to be alive, after most of the rest were released in ceasefire agreements or other deals. Israeli forces have rescued eight living hostages from Gaza and recovered dozens of bodies.",
