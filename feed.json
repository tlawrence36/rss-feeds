      "House Republicans will look to cut about $9.4 billion in spending already approved by Congress as President Donald Trump\u2019s administration seeks to follow through on work by the Department of Government Efficiency when it was overseen by Elon Musk",
      "WASHINGTON -- House Republicans are moving to cut about $9.4 billion in spending already approved by Congress as President Donald Trump's administration looks to follow through on work by the Department of Government Efficiency when it was overseen by Elon Musk.",
      "The package to be voted on Thursday targets foreign aid programs and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which provides money for National Public Radio and the Public Broadcasting Service, as well as thousands of public radio and television stations around the country.",
      "Republicans are characterizing the spending as wasteful and unnecessary, but Democrats say the rescissions are hurting the United States' standing in the world.",
      "\u201cCruelty is the point,\u201d Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York said of the proposed spending cuts.",
      "The Trump administration is employing a tool rarely used in recent years that allows the president to transmit a request to Congress to cancel previously appropriated funds. That triggers a 45-day clock in which the funds are frozen pending congressional action. If Congress fails to act within that period, then the spending stands.",
      "The benefit for the administration of a formal rescissions request is that passage requires only a simple majority in the 100-member Senate instead of the 60 votes usually required to get spending bills through that chamber. So, if they stay united, Republicans will be able to pass the measure without any Democratic votes.",
      "The administration is likening the first rescissions package to a test case and says more could be on the way if Congress goes along.",
      "Republicans, sensitive to concerns that Trump's sweeping tax and immigration bill would increase future federal deficits, are anxious to demonstrate spending discipline, though the cuts in the package amount to just a sliver of the spending approved by Congress each year. They are betting the cuts prove popular with constituents who align with Trump's \u201cAmerica first\u201d ideology as well as those who view NPR and PBS as having a liberal bias.",
      "In all, the package contains 21 proposed rescissions. Approval would claw back about $900 million from $10 billion that Congress has approved for global health programs. That includes canceling $500 million for activities related to infectious diseases and child and maternal health and another $400 million to address the global HIV epidemic.",
      "The Trump administration is also looking to cancel $800 million, or a quarter of the amount Congress approved, for a program that provides emergency shelter, water and sanitation, and family reunification for those forced to flee their own country.",
      "About 45% of the savings sought by the White House would come from two programs designed to boost the economies, democratic institutions and civil societies in developing countries.",
      "The Republican president has also asked lawmakers to rescind nearly $1.1 billion from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which represents the full amount it\u2019s slated to receive during the next two budget years. About two-thirds of the money gets distributed to more than 1,500 locally owned public radio and television stations. Nearly half of those stations serve rural areas of the country.",
      "The association representing local public television stations warns that many of them would be forced to close if the Republican measure passes. Those stations provide emergency alerts, free educational programming and high school sports coverage and highlight hometown heroes.",
      "Advocacy groups that serve the world's poorest people are also sounding the alarm and urging lawmakers to vote no.",
      "\u201cWe are already seeing women, children and families left without food, clean water and critical services after earlier aid cuts, and aid organizations can barely keep up with rising needs,\u201d said Abby Maxman, president and CEO of Oxfam America, a poverty-fighting organization.",
      "Rep. Jim McGovern, D-Mass., said the foreign aid is a tool that prevents conflict and promotes stability but the measure before the House takes that tool away.",
      "\u201cThese cuts will lead to the deaths of hundreds of thousands, devastating the most vulnerable in the world,\u201d McGovern said. \u201cAnd at a time when China and Russia and Iran are working overtime to challenge American influence.\u201d",
      "Republicans disparaged the foreign aid spending and sought to link it to programs they said DOGE had uncovered.",
      "Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, said taxpayer dollars had gone to such things as targeting climate change, promoting pottery classes and strengthening diversity, equity and inclusion programs. Other Republicans cited similar examples they said DOGE had revealed.",
      "\u201cYet, my friends on the other side of the aisle would like you to believe, seriously, that if you don't use your taxpayer dollars to fund this absurd list of projects and thousands of others I didn't even list, that somehow people will die and our global standing in the world will crumble,\u201d Roy said. \"Well, let's just reject this now.\u201d",

      "Sometimes death, as life, brings strange symmetries",
      "Sometimes there are strange symmetries in death, as in life. The twin passings of Sly Stone and Brian Wilson this week brought that into sharp relief.",
      "Both were musical geniuses who paid a high price for their gifts. They burned bright, with art they created at their peaks that became more moving and meaningful with time, only to see their creative lights extinguished suddenly through mental health and addiction issues. Both were 82 when they died \u2014 Stone on Monday and Wilson on Wednesday.",
      "\u201cIt's such an unsettling coincidence,\u201d said Anthony DeCurtis, contributing editor at Rolling Stone. \u201cThese two figures, they were very different and massively influential, and each ran into a wall of their own problems in many ways. As much as they achieved, it's hard not to think that they could have done more.\u201d",
      "With his late brothers Carl and Dennis, Beach Boys co-founder Wilson was the architect of the California sound that captured surfing and sun, beaches and girls. Yet for all the \u201cFun, Fun, Fun,\u201d there was something much deeper and darker in Brian's abilities as a composer.",
      "It was more than disposable music for teen-agers. He had an unparalleled melodic sense, hearing sounds in his mind that others couldn't. He could worm his way into your head and then break your heart with songs like \u201cIn My Room\u201d and \u201cGod Only Knows.\u201d The tour de force \u201cGood Vibrations\u201d \u2014- had anyone ever heard of the theremin before he employed its unearthly wail? \u2014 is a symphony both complex and easily accessible.",
      "\u201cHe was our American Mozart,\u201d musician Sean Ono Lennon wrote on social media.",
      "The 1966 album \u201cPet Sounds\u201d was a peak. Wilson felt a keen sense of competition with the Beatles. But they had three writers, including Sean's dad, John Lennon. Wilson was largely alone, and he heard impatience and doubt from other Beach Boys, whose music he provided.",
      "He felt the pressure in trying to follow up \u201cPet Sounds,\u201d and \u201cSmile\u201d became music's most famous unfinished album. Wilson, a damaged soul to begin with because of an abusive father, never reached the heights again. He descended into a well-chronicled period of darkness.",
      "Stone's skills came in creating a musical world that others only dreamed of at the time. The Family Stone was an integrated world \u2014 Black and white, men and women \u2014 and the music they created was a potent mixture of rock, soul and funk. It made you move, it made you think.",
      "For a period of time from 1967 to 1973, their music was inescapable \u2014 \u201cDance to the Music,\u201d \u201cEverybody is a Star,\u201d \u201cHigher,\u201d \u201cHot Fun in the Summertime,\u201d \u201cSing a s Simple Song,\u201d \u201cFamily Affair,\u201d \u201cThank You (Falettinme Be Mice Elf Agin).\u201d Their performance at Woodstock was a milestone.",
      "\u201cHis songs weren't just about fighting injustice, they were about transforming the self to transform the world,\u201d musician and documentarian Questlove, who lovingly tended to Stone's legacy, wrote this week. \u201cHe dared to be simple in the most complex ways \u2014 using childlike joy, wordless cries and nursery rhyme cadences to express adult truths. His work looked straight at the brightest and darkest parts of life and demanded we do the same.\u201d",
      "From his peak, the fall was hard. Years of drug abuse took its toll. Periodic comeback attempts deepened a sense of bewilderment and pity.",
      "Music is littered with stories of sudden, untimely and early deaths. Yet until this week, both men lived on, somewhat improbably passing average life expectancies.",
      "Wilson, by many measures, achieved some level of peace late in life. He had a happy marriage. He was able to see how his music was revered and appreciated and spent several years performing it again with a younger band that clearly worshiped him. It was a postscript not many knew, said journalist Jason Fine, who befriended Wilson and made the 2021 documentary, \u201cBrian Wilson: Long Promised Road.\u201d",
      "\u201cThat sort of simple message he really wanted to give people through his music going back to the \u201860s \u2014 a sense of warmth, a sense that it\u2019s going to be OK in the same way that music lifted him up from his darkness, he'd try to do for other people,\u201d Fine told The Associated Press in an interview then. \u201cI think now, more than earlier in his career, he accepts that he does that and that's a great comfort to him.\u201d",
      "Stone emerged to write an autobiography in 2023. But less is known about his later years, whether he found peace or died without the full knowledge of what his music meant to others.",
      "\u201cYes, Sly battled addiction,\u201d Questlove wrote. \u201cYes, he disappeared from the spotlight. But he lived long enough to outlast many of his disciples, to feel the ripples of his genius return through hip-hop samples, documentaries and his memoir. Still, none of that replaces the raw beauty of his original work.\u201d",
      "Did Sly Stone and Brian Wilson live lives of tragedy or triumph? It's hard to say now. One suspects it will become easier with the passage of time, when only the work remains. That sometimes brings clarity.",
      "\u201cMillions of people had their lives changed by their music,\u201d DeCurtis said. \u201cNot just enjoyed it, but had their lives transformed. That's quite an accomplishment.\u201d",

      "Vance met with the group at the Murdoch family ranch in southwest Montana near Dillon, according to the people. They confirmed the visit to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly about it.",
      "It\u2019s not clear why the vice president addressed the group or what they spoke about.",
      "A spokesperson for Fox News Channel did not respond to a message seeking comment.",
      "The vice president's office does not release a schedule for Vance and did not offer advance notice of the trip, so the surprise arrival of Air Force Two in Butte, Montana, set off local speculation as his motorcade was seen driving away.",
      "The Murdoch ranch near Dillon is roughly 70 miles (110 kilometers) south of Butte. The ranch, which Murdoch purchased in 2021, is spread across two valleys and a mountain range and has some 12,000 cattle. It sits near Yellowstone National Park along the Montana-Idaho border.",
      "According to flight restrictions issued by the Federal Aviation Administration, the vice presidential aircraft was only on the ground for a matter of hours.",
      "Vance was scheduled to have lunch with President Donald Trump on Wednesday, according to the president's publicly released schedule, meaning the vice president presumably returned to Washington shortly after meeting the Murdochs 2,200 miles (3,500 kilometers) away on Tuesday night.",
      "Rupert Murdoch and his media organization have long been friendly with Republicans and have, for the most part, had a friendly relationship with Trump. He appeared at Trump's inauguration and was spotted earlier this year in the Oval Office.",
      "Rupert Murdoch, 94, stepped down as the head of Fox News and News Corp. in 2023 and handed control over to son Lachlan.",
      "Montana state Auditor James Brown told the Montana Talks radio show that he helped Vance\u2019s staff arrange the trip.",

      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump is set to take a seat at Wednesday's opening night of the award-winning musical \u201cLes Mis\u00e9rables\" at the Kennedy Center, where he replaced the previous leadership with loyalists, had himself installed as chairman and pledged to rid the performing arts venue of programming he has complained is \u201cwoke\u201d and too focused on leftist ideology and political correctness.",
      "The Republican president's attendance at the sold-out showing of the Tony Award-winning tale of redemption in 19th century France comes as he has focused more than any recent predecessor on the arts center along the Potomac River that is a memorial to a slain Democratic president.",
      "Presidents' involvement in the Kennedy Center's affairs had been limited to naming members to the board of trustees and attending the taping of its annual honors program in the fall.",
      "But after returning to office in January, Trump stunned the arts world by firing the Kennedy Center's longtime director and board and replacing them with loyalists, who then named him as chairman, and promising to overhaul its programming, management and even appearance as part of an effort to put his stamp on the national arts scene.",
      "Trump's appearance in the Opera House on Wednesday, accompanied by first lady Melania Trump, will also mark his first time at a Kennedy Center performance as president. He avoided the venue after entertainment industry pushback to his policies in his first term in office, breaking with presidential tradition by never attending the annual Kennedy Center Honors taping.",
      "His moves have upset some of the center's patrons and performers.",
      "In March, the audience booed Vice President JD Vance and his wife, Usha, after they slipped into upper-level seats in the Concert Hall to hear the National Symphony Orchestra. Trump appointed Usha Vance to the Kennedy Center board along with White House chief of staff Susie Wiles, Attorney General Pam Bondi and Fox News Channel hosts Maria Bartiromo and Laura Ingraham, among other supporters.",
      "Sales of subscription packages are said to have declined since Trump's takeover, and several touring productions, including \u201cHamilton,\u201d have canceled planned runs at the center. Artists such as actor Issa Rae and musician Rhiannon Giddens scrapped scheduled appearances, and Kennedy Center consultants including musician Ben Folds and singer Ren\u00e9e Fleming have resigned.",
      "Understudies may perform Wednesday night due to boycotts by \u201cLes Mis\u00e9rables\u201d cast members.",
      "Since returning to the White House in January, Trump has adopted a more aggressive posture toward the arts. The White House has taken steps to cancel millions of dollars in previously awarded federal humanities grants to arts and culture groups, and Trump\u2019s budget blueprint proposed eliminating the National Endowment for the Arts and the National Endowment for the Humanities.",
      "Trump has also targeted Smithsonian museums by signing executive orders to restrict their funding and by attempting to fire the director of the National Portrait Gallery.",
      "Trump hosted the board at the White House for dinner in May and said congressional Republicans have pushed for more than $250 million for repairs and maintenance at the Kennedy Center. He claimed that \u201ctremendous amounts of money\u201d had been spent at the center but \u201cthey certainly didn't spend it on wallpaper, carpet or painting.\u201d",
      "He characterized previous programming as \u201cout of control with rampant political propaganda\u201d and said it featured \u201csome very inappropriate shows,\u201d including a \u201cMarxist anti-police performance\u201d and \u201cLesbian-only Shakespeare.\u201d",
      "Trump cited some drag show performances as a reason to take control of the center, though next season's theater lineup includes \u201dMrs. Doubtfire,\" which tells the story of a divorced man who disguises himself as a female nanny so he can spend time with his children.",
      "Trump also visited the Kennedy Center in March to preside over a board meeting and take a tour.",
      "The Kennedy Center, which is supported by government money and private donations, opened in 1971 and for decades has been seen as an apolitical celebration of the arts.",
      "It was first conceived in the late 1950s, during the administration of Republican President Dwight Eisenhower, who backed a bill from the Democratic-led Congress calling for a National Culture Center. In the early 1960s, Democratic President John F. Kennedy launched a fundraising initiative, and his successor, President Lyndon B. Johnson, signed into law a 1964 bill renaming the project the John F. Kennedy Memorial Center for the Performing Arts. Kennedy had been assassinated the year before.",

      "BERLIN -- German artist G\u00fcnther Uecker, one of the country's most important post-war artists who was world-famous for his large-format nail reliefs, has died. He was 95.",
      "German news agency dpa reported that his family confirmed he died at the university hospital in his hometown of D\u00fcsseldorf in western Germany Tuesday night. They did not give a cause of death.",
      "For decades, Uecker, who was often dubbed \u201cthe nail artist,\u201d created art by hammering carpenter\u2019s nails into chairs, pianos, sewing machines and canvases. His works can be found in museums and collections across the globe.",
      "In his art work, seemingly endless numbers of nails, which would by themselves perhaps be perceived as potentially aggressive and hurtful, turned into harmonic, almost organic creations. His reliefs with the tightly hewn nails are reminiscent of waving grasses or fields of algae in a marine landscape.",
      "Uecker himself described his nail art as diary-like landscapes of the soul, which he called an \u201cexpression of the poetic power of man,\u201d dpa reported.",
      "Hendrik W\u00fcst, the governor of North Rhine-Westphalia which includes state capital D\u00fcsseldorf, called Uecker \u201cone of the most important and influential artists in German post-war history\u201d and said that with his life\u2019s work, he influenced generations of young artists and \u201ccontributed to an open and dynamic society.\"",
      "Born on March 13, 1930, in the village of Wendorf on the Baltic Sea, Uecker moved to D\u00fcsseldorf in the mid-1950s, where he studied and later also taught at the city's prestigious art academy.",
      "In one of his most spectacular appearances or art happenings, he rode on the back of a camel through the hallways of the venerable academy in 1978. Together with fellow artist Gerhard Richter, he \u201coccupied\u201d the Kunsthalle Baden-Baden museum in 1968, with both kissing in front of the cameras.",
      "The son of a farmer, he traveled the world with a humanitarian message of peace and exhibited in countless countries, including dictatorships and totalitarian states. He painted ash pictures after the Chernobyl nuclear disaster in Ukraine in 1986, and exhibited human rights messages painted on fabric in Beijing.",
      "He also painted \u201cVerletzungsw\u00f6rter,\u201d or words of violence, killing and torment in many languages and foreign scripts on large canvases. In 2023, Uecker erected a stone memorial in Weimar in memory of the victims of the Nazi concentration camp Buchenwald.",
      "\u201cThe theme of my artistic work is the vulnerability of man by man,\u201d he said.",

      "The \u201cbones\u201d of Theo Jansen\u2019s \u201cstrandbeesten\u201d \u2014 beach animals in Dutch \u2014 have taken over a former cable factory in Delft, the small city in the western Netherlands that Jansen has called home for decades.",
      "\u201cDuring the years, there has been a sort of evolutionary history, you could say. And you could see these animals as sort of natural historical objects,\u201d the 77-year old artist told The Associated Press before the installation\u2019s opening.",
      "The Strandbeesten Mortuary, as the exhibition is called, follows the various versions of the mobile sculptures since 1990 when Jansen created the first one from plastic pipes and tape. As the animals evolved, Jansen incorporated plastic bottles, wooden planks, cloth and cardboard.",
      "The life and death cycle of these famous animals \u2014 formed mostly out of PVC pipes \u2014 has left behind an impressive fossil record, which is on display at the exhibition.",
      "Marloes Koster, who organized the exhibition for Delft\u2019s Prinsenhof Museum, said that Jansen\u2019s ultimate goal is to create a beast that will live forever.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s not there yet, so these are the ones that didn\u2019t make it,\u201d she added.",
      "The museum is undergoing major renovations, so Koster and her colleagues have been putting together arts and culture events at alternative venues around the city while the building is shut.",
      "Born near the North Sea, Jansen grew up captivated by the wind that often hits the Dutch coastline. He harnessed it to allow his animals to \u201cwalk\u201d along the beach. Every year, he creates a new strandbeest and, at the end of the summer, declares the animal dead.",
      "\u201cAll summer I do experiments, and in the fall I\u2019m a little bit wiser (about) how these animals should survive in the future,\u201d Jansen said.",
      "Many of the visitors to the opening of the exhibition had followed Jansen\u2019s work for years and were keen to understand how the strandbeesten had changed over time.",
      "\u201cYou see a kind of development in the way he does things. So they start out very simple, and then it gets increasingly complicated. So they evolve,\u201d said Cor Nonhof, a Delft local who had come to see the exhibition with his wife.",
      "Even at the opening, Jansen was already keen to return to the beach to work on the latest evolution of his strandbeesten.",
      "\u201cI cannot do anything else,\u201d Jansen said. \u201cAnd I am very happy with that.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "In the heart of Spain\u2019s capital, the famous Sobrino de Bot\u00edn restaurant proudly holds the title of being the world\u2019s oldest restaurant",
      "MADRID -- In the heart of Spain's capital, Sobrino de Bot\u00edn holds a coveted Guinness World Record as the world's oldest restaurant. Exactly three hundred years after it opened its doors, Bot\u00edn welcomes droves of daily visitors hungry for Castilian fare with a side of history.",
      "But on the outskirts of Madrid, far from the souvenir shops and tourist sites, a rustic tavern named Casa Pedro makes a bold claim. Its owners assert the establishment endured not just the Spanish Civil War in the 1930s and the Napoleonic invasion in the early 1800s, but even the War of Spanish Succession at the start of the 18th century \u2014 a lineage that would make Casa Pedro older than Bot\u00edn and a strong contender for the title.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s really frustrating when you say, \u2018Yes, we\u2019ve been around since 1702,\u2019 but ... you can\u2019t prove it,\u201d said manager and eighth-generation proprietor Irene Gui\u00f1ales. \u201cIf you look at the restaurant\u2019s logo, it says \u2018Casa Pedro, since 1702,\u2019 so we said, \u2018Damn it, let\u2019s try to prove it.\u2019\u201d",
      "Gui\u00f1ales, 51, remembers her grandfather swearing by Casa Pedro\u2019s age, but she was aware that decades-old hearsay from a proud old-timer wouldn't be enough to prove it. Her family hired a historian and has so far turned up documents dating the restaurant's operations to at least 1750.",
      "That puts them within striking distance of Bot\u00edn\u2019s record.",
      "Both taverns are family-owned. Both offer Castilian classics like stewed tripe and roast suckling pig. They are decorated with charming Spanish tiles, feature ceilings with exposed wooden beams and underground wine cellars. And both enjoy a rich, star-studded history.",
      "Bot\u00edn's celebrated past includes a roster of literary patrons like Truman Capote, F. Scott Fitzgerald and Graham Greene. In his book \u201cThe Sun Also Rises,\u201d Ernest Hemingway described it as \u201cone of the best restaurants in the world.\" While Casa Pedro may not have boasted the same artistic pedigree, it boasts its own VIPs. Its walls are adorned with decades-old photographs of former Spanish King Juan Carlos I dining in one of its many rooms. The current Spanish monarch, King Felipe VI dines there, too, albeit more inconspicuously than his father.",
      "But the similarities between the two hotspots end there.",
      "Casa Pedro was once a stop on the only road heading north from the Spanish capital toward France. Its clientele is largely local regulars, like David Gonz\u00e1lez and Mayte Villena, who for years have spent every Friday lunching at the tavern.",
      "\u201cIt wouldn't change a thing for us,\u201d Villena said about the restaurant someday securing the Guinness title.",
      "Bot\u00edn, on the other hand, is a stone\u2019s throw from Madrid\u2019s famed Plaza Mayor, where any day of the week tour guides are herding groups around town \u2014 and often straight through the restaurant's front door.",
      "Antonio Gonz\u00e1lez, a third-generation proprietor of Bot\u00edn, concedes that the Guinness accolade awarded in 1987 has helped business, but said the restaurant had enough history to draw visitors even before.",
      "\u201cIt has a certain magic,\u201d he said.",
      "The question then becomes: How can either restaurant definitively claim the title? Guinness provides its specific guidelines for the superlative only to applicants, according to spokesperson Kylie Galloway, noting that it entails \u201csubstantial evidence and documentation of the restaurant\u2019s operation over the years.\"",
      "Gonz\u00e1lez said that Guinness required Bot\u00edn show that it has continuously operated in the same location with the same name.",
      "The only time the restaurant closed was during the COVID-19 pandemic, as did Casa Pedro.",
      "That criteria would mean that restaurants that are even older \u2014 Paris' Le Procope, which says it was founded in 1686, or Beijing\u2019s Bianyifang, founded in 1416, or the 1673-established White Horse Tavern in Newport, Rhode Island \u2014 aren't eligible for the designation.",
      "La Campana, in Rome\u2019s historic center, claims over 500 years of operation, citing documents on its menu and in a self-published history. Its owners say they have compiled the requisite paperwork and plan to submit it to Guinness.",
      "Gui\u00f1ales and her husband couldn't consult archives from the former town of Fuencarral, now a Madrid neighborhood. Those papers went up in flames during the Spanish Civil War. Instead, they delved into Spanish national archives, where they found land registries of the area from the First Marquess of Ensenada (1743-1754) that showed the existence of a tavern, wine cellar and inn in the small town as of 1750.",
      "In their spare time, the couple continues to hunt for records proving that Casa Pedro indeed dates back to 1702, as is proclaimed on its walls, takeout bags and sugar packets.",
      "But even if they dig up the final documents and wrest the Guinness honor from Bot\u00edn, Gui\u00f1ales concedes that her restaurant's quiet location makes it unlikely to draw Bot\u00edn\u2019s clientele in central Madrid.",
      "\u201cTo think that we could reach that public would be incredible,\u201d Gui\u00f1ales said. \u201cIt's a dream, but it's a dream.\u201d",

      "So he went to a megachurch youth group, which promised teenage shenanigans without much danger. The \u201csanitized mischief,\u201d as he describes it, was perfect for Morris, who grew up as a nerdy, nervous kid.",
      "\u201cYouth group was great for me,\u201d Morris said. \u201cWe can put on a show, we can sing little songs, we can do little skits.

      "Morris also said he\u2019d rarely seen stories set in the kind of youth group he\u2019d grown up in.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve just never seen that little world written about in a way that I thought was like, accurate or, like, that got what it was about,\u201d he said.",
      "Published last year by New York-based First Second Books, \u201cYouth Group\u201d tells the story of Kay Radford, a theater kid who winds up joining the Stone Mission megachurch youth group after her parents split up. Her mom is a true believer but lonely. Kay is more skeptical but lonely as well and angry at her dad.",
      "\u201cChurch might help with all this,\u201d Kay\u2019s mom tells her early on. \u201cI think we both could use some community.\u201d",
      "At the youth group, Kay is met by youth leader Meg Parks, a kind but sometimes over-the-top youth leader in pink; a bearded, hippy pastor who turns the \u201cPina Colada song\u201d \u2014 the Rupert Holmes hit \u201cEscape\u201d \u2014 into a metaphor for spiritual seeking; and a band that churns out parodies like \u201cI Saw the Christ\u201d sung to the melody of Ace of Base\u2019s \u201cThe Sign.\u201d",
      "Though fictional, the songs fit the kind of pop culture reference \u2014 sometimes known as a \u201cJesus juke\u201d \u2014 that youth groups can be known for.",
      "\u201cI always think there\u2019s something funny about that move, where you take a secular piece of entertainment, like a song that\u2019s in the zeitgeist, or a popular movie and try and give the hidden religious message,\u201d Morris said.",
      "Kay eventually discovers the youth pastor and some of the older Stone Mission kids also fight demons. That fight becomes personal after one of the demons goes after her dad, and Kay decides to join the battle. Along the way, the Stone Mission kids team up with youth groups from other faiths \u2014 Temple Beth Israel, Immaculate Heart parish and the Polaris Coven \u2014 to fight off a demon invasion with the help of some training by an order of nuns.",
      "Morris said he and illustrator Bowen McCurdy wanted to tell a story that was more than just satire. And while he no longer embraces the faith of his youth, Morris still sees value in the lessons he learned, like the importance of loving your neighbor.",
      "\u201cWe wanted to tell a story of people from a lot of different religions coming together with a common goal,\u201d he said.",
      "Matthew Cressler, a religion scholar and creator of the webcomic series \u201cBad Catholics, Good Trouble,\u201d said comics with evangelical or denominational settings like \u201cYouth Group\u201d are uncommon. Religion in comics, he said, is often seen as \u201ca marker of difference\u201d: for example, Kamala Khan, the Muslim-American hero known as Ms. Marvel, or Matt Murdock, better known as Daredevil, who is Irish-Catholic. In the 1960s, when Daredevil was created, Catholics were still seen as outsiders to the American mainstream, and many of the most popular heroes, like Batman, were seen as Mainline Protestants.",
      "While there were comics for evangelicals, they were often evangelistic, like the controversial Jack Chick tracts or the Christianized adventures of Archie and his friends, published by Spire Comics starting in the 1970s. And evangelicals have often downplayed the kind of sacramental imagery and architecture found in mainline or Catholic settings and try to avoid the kind of visuals needed for comics, said Cressler.",
      "Matthew Brake, founder and editor of online publication Pop Culture and Theology, said non-denominational churches often have a \u201clet\u2019s go to the mall aesthetic\u201d and lack the visual clout of Catholicism.",
      "\u201cNondenominational churches are sort of a cultural underdog,\u201d he said.",
      "That may change, Brake said, as creators like Morris, who grew up in non-denominational settings, come of age. And those settings often contain surprises. Although they are most known for things like worship music and purity culture, megachurches also provide space to talk about things like social justice.",
      "Still, he wonders if many nondenominational Christians would be the kinds of fans that would enjoy a book like \u201cYouth Group\u201d or \u201cPreacher,\u201d a late-1990s comic about an evangelical pastor who ends up possessed by a supernatural being.",
      "David Canham, who reviews comics for the secular pop-culture website AIPT \u2014 short for \u201cAdventures in Poor Taste\u201d \u2014 had mixed feelings about \u201cYouth Group.\u201d",
      "\u201cFirst off, there\u2019s plenty of \u201990s nostalgia \u2014 a good-natured tongue-in-cheek look back at many of the silly and absurd things about \u201990s culture, with a focus on evangelical Christian culture,\u201d he wrote when the book came out. \u201c\u2018Youth Group\u2019 delivers on this point.\u201d",
      "But the book\u2019s take on pluralism \u2014 the idea that all religion is on the same side \u2014 turned him off as an evangelical Christian. \u201cI don\u2019t want to recommend a book that promotes a worldview that so strongly disagrees with my own beliefs,\u201d he wrote.",
      "At first, Morris said he was worried the book might offend Christians and atheists alike. Some evangelicals might feel the book mocks their faith, while atheists might think the book overlooks the shortcomings of religious groups.",
      "Both those criticisms would be fair, he said. Religious groups get a lot of things wrong, and yet churches and other faith groups remain important to their members. Morris said he tried to walk a fine line of gently poking fun at faith while showing why it still has an impact on people\u2019s lives, and how the friendships made in youth groups may long endure.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t want the humor to be like, church is stupid, or say, \u2018look at this dumb church stuff,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cI wanted it to be funny and familiar.\u201d",
      "Morris said he wanted to capture the mixed feelings people have about the faiths in which they grew up. While he appreciated Bible teachings like caring for the needy, some of the politics and social messages, especially about LGBTQ+ folks, were a turnoff, he said.",
      "Religion, he said, is complicated.",
      "\u201cThere are a lot of wonderful memories, and there\u2019s a lot of stuff that gives me the ick,\u201d he said. \u201cI hope that\u2019s in the book. I hope you can see how a religious upbringing can be upsetting and wonderful \u2014 comforting but also makes you mad.\u201d",

      "YEONCHEON, South Korea -- Hundreds of fans gathered in the early morning hours to catch a glimpse of K-pop superstars Jimin and Jung Kook, the latest and final members of BTS to be discharged from South Korea\u2019s mandatory military service.",
      "The pair wore their military uniforms Wednesday, saluted and addressed fans who had assembled to see the pair after their discharge.",
      "Jung Kook thanked the journalists and fans who traveled to see him and Jimin after their discharge and acknowledged how different it was to be back in the spotlight. \u201cActually, it\u2019s been so long since I\u2019ve been in front of cameras, and I didn\u2019t even put on makeup, so I\u2019m a bit embarrassed,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t know what to say.\u201d",
      "The pair enlisted in December 2023, one day after RM and V did the same. The latter were discharged on Tuesday.",
      "Supporters traveled from around the world to the public sports ground where the meet-and-greet took place. It was moved from the military base\u2019s gate for safety reasons. Color-wrapped buses bearing BTS members\u2019 faces lined the streets while red and yellow balloons floated above and a decorated food truck provided free coffee and water, adding to the festive atmosphere.",
      "Many supporters wore masks, conscious of potential backlash after the band\u2019s label discouraged attendance citing safety concerns. Despite the challenges, fans like Anaesi from Portugal said the 20-hour journey to Yeoncheon, a town near the tense border with North Korea, was worth it.",
      "\u201cPortugal is a small country, but inside of Portugal, BTS is a king,\u201d she said. Anaesi, who discovered BTS on YouTube, said the group \u201csaved\u201d her from depression. \u201cSo for me BTS is my angel,\u201d she said. She displayed a colorful upper arm tattoo featuring a golden shield emblazoned with \u201cARMY\u201d and an eagle above it, complemented by Korean text listing BTS members\u2019 names and those of her friends.",
      "V thanked fans Tuesday for their patience in waiting for him and RM's return and teased the band's reunion. \"If you can just wait a little bit longer, we will return with a really amazing performance.\u201d",
      "The seven singers of the popular K-pop band plan to reunite as a group sometime in 2025 after they finish their service.",
      "Six of the group\u2019s seven members served in the army, while Suga is fulfilling his duty as a social service agent, an alternative form of military service. He will be discharged later this month.",
      "Jin, the oldest BTS member, was discharged in June 2024. J-Hope was discharged in October.",
      "In South Korea, all able-bodied men aged 18 to 28 are required by law to perform 18-21 months of military service under a conscription system meant to deter aggression from rival North Korea.",
      "The law gives special exemptions to athletes, classical and traditional musicians, and ballet and other dancers if they have obtained top prizes in certain competitions and are assessed to have enhanced national prestige. K-pop stars and other entertainers aren\u2019t subject to such privileges.",
      "However, in 2020, BTS postponed their service until age 30 after South Korea\u2019s National Assembly revised its Military Service Act, allowing K-pop stars to delay their enlistment until age 30.",
      "There was heated public debate in 2022 over whether to offer special exemptions of mandatory military service for BTS members, until the group\u2019s management agency announced in October 2022 that all seven members would fulfill their duties.",

      "NASHVILLE, Tenn. -- Country musician Conner Smith fatally hit a pedestrian while driving his truck in Nashville over the weekend, and he currently faces no charges as an investigation continues, police said.",
      "Metro Nashville Police said Smith, 24, hit Dorothy Dobbins, 77, Sunday evening while she was crossing the road inside a marked crosswalk. Dobbins, a retired attorney, later died at a hospital. The Tennessee Bar Association posted on its website that Dobbins had been out walking her dog when she was hit.",
      "Police say Smith showed no signs of impairment. They believe the \u201cpreliminary contributing factor\u201d appears to be that Smith did not yield the right of way to the pedestrian.",
      "Smith\u2019s attorney, Worrick Robinson, said his client is cooperating with the investigation.",
      "\u201cHis heart goes out to Ms. Dobbins\u2019 family during this incredibly difficult time,\" Robinson said in a statement.",
      "Dobbins was a leader in the city\u2019s legal aid and family law communities, where she practiced for over 40 years, according to posts by the Bar Association and the Legal Aid Society of Middle Tennessee and the Cumberlands. She played a \u201cfoundational role in opening Nashville\u2019s first domestic violence shelter,\u201d according to a Facebook post from the Legal Aid Society, and she wrote the state\u2019s first order of protection legislation.",

      "Lame arrived in the U.S. on April 30 and \u201coverstayed the terms of his visa,\u201d the ICE spokesperson said. The Associated Press sent a message seeking comment Tuesday to the email address listed on Lame\u2019s Instagram account. He has not publicly commented on his detainment.",
      "His detainment and voluntary departure from the U.S. comes amid President Donald Trump\u2019s escalating crackdown on immigration, including raids in Los Angeles that sparked days of protests against ICE, as the president tests the bounds of his executive authority.",
      "A voluntary departure \u2014 which was granted to Lame \u2014 allows those facing removal from the U.S. to avoid a deportation order on their immigration record, which could prevent them from being allowed back into the U.S. for up to a decade.",
      "The 25-year-old rose to international fame during the pandemic without ever saying a word in his videos, which would show him reacting to absurdly complicated \u201clife hacks.\" He has over 162 million followers on TikTok alone.",
      "The Senegal-born influencer moved to Italy when he was an infant with his working class parents and has Italian citizenship.",
      "His internet fame quickly evolved. He signed a multi-year partnership with designer brand Hugo Boss in 2022. In January, he was appointed as a UNICEF goodwill ambassador.",

      "The admission from Victoria Heuermann isn\u2019t made on camera but through a statement from producers near the end of \u201cThe Gilgo Beach Killer: House of Secrets,\u201d a three-part documentary on NBC\u2019s streaming service Peacock.",
      "\u201cA week before the series release, Victoria Heuermann told the producers that based on publicly available facts that have been presented and explained to her, she now believes her father is most likely the Gilgo Beach killer,\u201d reads a statement at the close of the final episode of the documentary.",
      "Bob Macedonio, an attorney for Heuermann\u2019s now ex-wife, Asa Ellerup, said in a statement after the documentary\u2019s release that \u201ctime will only tell\u201d whether his client will ever accept that her husband may have been a serial killer.",

      "In the documentary, Victoria Heuermann struggles to reconcile her childhood memories with the portrait of the killer described by authorities.",
      "She says her father was around the family \u201c90% of the time\u201d and was never violent toward any of them.",
      "At the same time, Victoria Heuermann acknowledged there were times when he stayed home while the family went on vacation and that she was around 10 to 13 years old when the killings happened. Prosecutors say Heuerman committed some of the killings in the basement while his family was out of town.",
      "\u201cWhether or not I believe my dad did it or not, I\u2019m on the fence about that,\u201d said the now 28-year-old. \u201cPart of me thinks he didn\u2019t do it, but at the same time, I don\u2019t know, he could have just totally had a double life.\u201d",
      "Ellerup, for her part, maintained she saw no \u201cabnormal behavior\u201d in their nearly three decades of marriage.",
      "She dismissed a computer file prosecutors claim is a \u201cblueprint\u201d of his crimes as \u201cabsurd.\u201d",
      "Prosecutors say the document features a series of checklists for before, during and after a killing, such as a \u201cbody prep\u201d checklist that includes among other items a note to \u201cremove head and hands.\u201d",
      "Ellerup also shrugged off other evidence prosecutors have enumerated in court documents, including a vast collection of bondage and torture pornography found on electronic devices seized from their home, and hairs linked to Heuermann that were recovered on most of the victims\u2019 bodies.",
      "At the same time, she revealed that in July 2009, around the time one of his alleged victims went missing, Heuermann suddenly renovated a bathroom while she and their two children visited her family in Iceland. But she noted her former husband eventually joined the family for their final week of the trip.",
      "\u201cMy husband, he\u2019s a family man. He\u2019s my hero,\u201d Ellerup said. \u201cWhat I want to say to him is, \u2018I love you, no matter what.\u2019\u201d",
      "Ellerup divorced Heuermann after his arrest in 2023. But in the documentary, Victoria Heuermann says the separation was for financial reasons to protect the family\u2019s assets.",
      "Indeed, the filmmakers captured the family speaking to Heuermann by phone from jail, and the mother and daughter have been regularly attending court hearings with their attorney.",
      "The family, which also includes Ellerup\u2019s adult son from a prior marriage, is also planning to put up its notoriously ramshackle house in well-to-do Massapequa Park for sale as they look to move to a property they own in South Carolina.",
      "Ryan McCormick, an NBCUniversal spokesperson, declined to say how much family was compensated, though he said the payments could not go toward Heuermann or his defense funds.",

      "Before Celine Song was an Oscar-nominated filmmaker, she was a playwright in New York who needed day jobs to pay rent. That\u2019s how she found herself as a professional matchmaker.",
      "What may have begun as a purely transactional gig, a way for her to keep making her art in an expensive city, taught her more about people\u2019s wants and needs and the true contents of their hearts than she could have ever imagined.",
      "\u201cI always wanted to write something about it because there seemed to be a story in it that is massive and very epic in proportion,\u201d Song said. \u201cIt affects every human being on Earth.\"",
      "And while waiting for her breakout film \u201cPast Lives\u201d to debut, she did. That film is \u201cMaterialists,\u201d a modern-day New York love story starring Dakota Johnson, Pedro Pascal and Chris Evans that\u2019s heading to theaters this weekend. Johnson is the matchmaker presented with two different types of men for herself \u2014 one a poor struggling actor and ex-boyfriend, the other a wealthy \u201cunicorn\u201d \u2014 and the internet has already been drawing battle lines. But, like \u201cPast Lives\u201d wasn\u2019t really about a love triangle, \u201cMaterialists\u201d is about something more than the question of which guy is the \u201ccorrect\u201d choice.",
      "Song and Johnson spoke with The Associated Press about the film, falling in love and the modern marketplace of dating. Remarks have been edited for clarity and brevity.",
      "SONG: We met up thinking that we were just going to get to know each other and be friends and I walked away from that conversation \u2014 this is just from my perspective \u2014 but I think I was still sitting there when I texted my producers and the studio being like, \u201cI think I\u2019ve found my Lucy.\u201d That\u2019s how casting works for me, it\u2019s always about falling in love. It\u2019s very connected to what we talk about in the film. Like, there\u2019s no mathematical anything. It just the feeling that you get talking to someone and you\u2019re like, oh I just know.",
      "JOHNSON: I knew you had this movie that you were about to start making. I was basically told it was too late. I was like, but I really want to meet her because she\u2019s so smart, and I\u2019ve seen interviews and obviously had seen \u201cPast Lives.\u201d I just wanted talk and get to know her as an artist and a person and so I went into this being like there\u2019s no chance that I\u2019ll be in this movie, but maybe she\u2019ll make another one. We just had such a good time talking, I didn\u2019t even know that I was someone she was thinking about. A few weeks later we spoke. It was very romantic.",
      "JOHNSON: She\u2019s sort of at the top of her game in her work and is very disconnected from her heart and focused on being a perfectionist and getting people to get married. On the surface, you see her as a very transactional person and not really invested in people\u2019s souls, but she actually is and really does want the best for them. She\u2019s also on her own journey of trying to figure out what it is she wants for herself in this life, and, essentially, do you fight for the thing that you think you want, or do you fight for that thing that you know you need? Is that right, Celine?",
      "SONG: That\u2019s so good.",
      "SONG: It was never going to be a conversation about which flavor of a person. It\u2019s actually so much more about this marketplace of dating that all of us live in if you\u2019re single, and also the marketplace that Dakota\u2019s character is navigating. She knows the math better than anyone else in the film. She\u2019s an excellent matchmaker.",
      "Pedro plays somebody who is probably, in straight dating, someone of the highest possible value. Chris\u2019 character, in the spectrum in the marketplace of values of dating, is someone who is of the lowest value possible. I find them to be such adorable characters, very worthy of an adoration.",
      "Lucy knows exactly where they fall in the in the stock market of men. It\u2019s actually about the way that the math around that is going to blow up.",
      "JOHNSON: Celine speaks so eloquently about the marketplace of dating and I glitch at those words because I\u2019m like, you can\u2019t explain love that way. But that\u2019s actually how people are. Marriage used to be a business deal. It was like, my father wants your cows and my mother needs your wheat and whatever. It was a trade-off. But now there\u2019s all these books about how we expect our partner to fulfill every single aspect of our needs. And the world being dominated by social media, people don\u2019t meet in real life anymore. They don\u2019t behave normally in public.",
      "People are in a very strange place in evolution, and I think the difference between these two characters and these two men, sure they are different ends of the spectrum in terms of like technical value, materialistic value. But also each of them have the opposite in terms of psycho-spiritual value and emotional value and what they can offer the other person in terms of soul evolution and growth.",
      "Perhaps because she works in this world of trying to understand people and what they want, she\u2019s forced to go more inward and really interrogate herself and say, what do I really want and what is actually important in this life? Is it how much money I have or is it how truly loved I am?",
      "SONG: To me, it\u2019s about this contradiction, right? It\u2019s this thing of how we talk about what we want in our partner, when we\u2019re asked to use language to describe it, and how we literally, spiritually fall in love. The gap between those two things is terrifyingly big. To me, that\u2019s where the mystery of the film is.",

Just a few years ago, their inclusion might've been unthinkable amid murky regulations and a lack of public awareness surrounding harm reduction.",
      "Advocates say drugs are commonly consumed at music festivals, making them ideal locations for harm reduction activities. While more music festivals are allowing such activities, activists are pushing for expanded efforts as some festivals remain cautious.",
      "Founded by William Perry and Ingela Travers-Hayward in 2022, This Must Be The Place has since given away an estimated $4.5 million in naloxone, the opioid overdose reversal medication, at festivals and smaller community events.",
      "In the very beginning, without a \u201cproof of concept,\u201d as Perry describes it, they had trouble partnering with festivals. Eventually, a few festivals in the Midwest agreed to let them table, which \u201cgot us in the door with Bonnaroo in 2022,\u201d says Perry, referring to the major U.S. festival operated by C3 Presents, one of the largest concert promoters on the planet. Now they have a presence at 35 major U.S. festivals \u2014 including Lollapalooza, Governors Ball and Besame Mucho \u2014 where they collaborate directly with C3 and their security personnel.",
      "The organization's growth overlaps with advancing federal regulations. According to Daliah Heller, vice president of overdose prevention initiatives at the global public health nonprofit Vital Strategies, naloxone distribution used to be determined by state regulations until 2023, when the Food and Drug Administration approved the first over-the-counter nasal spray.",
      "\u201cWe no longer need the prescription laws to be amended to allow for the distribution of naloxone,\u201d she says. \u201cNow it's like buying aspirin \u2014 it's over the counter.\u201d",
      "Last year, This Must Be the Place gave away 46,146 units of Narcan \u2014 a brand name for naloxone \u2014 through their national festival outreach.",
      "Emmett Beliveau, chief operating officer of C3 Presents, says working with This Must Be the Place was C3\u2019s first time implementing public-facing harm reduction strategies, in addition to the promoter's existing medical programs.",
      "Bringing the organization into C3\u2019s festivals was \u201cnot in response to anything that has happened at one of our festivals,\u201d he says, but rather because of the \u201cnumber of fatalities happening in our communities.\u201d",
      "Some activists believe attendees are most responsive to receiving harm reduction education from peers instead of authority figures. And so, for the last three years, a nonprofit dedicated to combating accidental drug overdoses among young adults, Team Awareness Combating Overdose, has distributed fentanyl test strips and Narcan at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival.",
      "Former TACO CEO Kameran Mody says that music festivals are ideal locations for distribution and education because \u201cmusic and the use of drugs are synonymous with each other.\u201d",
      "TACO distributes through what Mody describes as \u201cguerrilla-style marketing.\u201d They enlist volunteers, train them on how to use naloxone, and ship Narcan and test strips to them to bring into the festival.",
      "They do not involve the festival organizers. Representatives for Coachella did not respond to The Associated Press' requests for comment.",
      "In 2023, a TACO volunteer administered Narcan to an unresponsive Coachella attendee exhibiting signs of an overdose. The organization says the attendee regained consciousness.",
      "\u201cThat was one of our biggest successes,\u201d Mody says.",
      "In 2019, at Bonnaroo, a 27-year-old man was found dead at his campsite \u2014 right after harm reduction activists had picketed the Tennessee festival because it didn't allow drug testing. The toxicology report found ecstasy and fentanyl in his system.",
      "At the time, under state law, test strips were criminalized and classified as drug paraphernalia. That\u2019s changed: In 2022, Tennessee decriminalized fentanyl test strips. By the end of 2023, 44 other states and D.C. had done the same.",
      "But in some states, drug paraphernalia laws are written in a way that isn't completely transparent \u2014 there are test strips that are not fentanyl-specific, Heller points out \u2014 and criminalization and social stigmas endure.",
      "Some have found workarounds. \u201cEven in the states where the legalities were a bit unclear, instead of just coming in and hoping things worked out, we would reach out to the health department, and say \u2018We run this project, how do feel about it?\u2019\u201d says Perry. \u201cWe would end up with letters from the highest-ranking health official, either in the county or in the state, saying \u2018We approve of this.\u2019 That circumvented any roadblocks.\u201d",
      "Some festivals, though, might be hesitant to use test strips because \u201cit\u2019s tough for them to admit that drugs are being used,\u201d Mody says. Some festivals have even banned naloxone.",
      "While This Must Be The Place distributes fentanyl test strips at some Ohio events, C3 doesn't distribute test strips at its events and does not plan to. Beliveau doesn't believe fentanyl test strips are effective and expressed concern they could encourage drug use. Test strips, which can detect fentanyl in pills, powders or injectables, are recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as a low-cost means of helping prevent drug overdoses.",
      "At a three-day electronic music festival in Mexico City earlier this year, a booth provided free, anonymous drug testing. The initiative, known as \u201cCheca tu Sustancia\u201d (Check Your Substance), was spearheaded by the Instituto RIA, a Mexico-based drug policy research and advocacy organization.",
      "When unexpected substances are detected, users received detailed information on what they are, their risks, potential interactions with other substances and dosage adjustments, empowering them to make informed choices.",
      "Perry says they are aware of smaller festivals in the United States conducting drug checking, but \u201cthey do it in a very underground and whisper network way\u201d to avoid criminalization.",
      "What Perry says his organization would like to see at music festivals in the future would be harm reduction areas \u2014 sections where attendees who have taken drugs can be monitored, not to \u201cget them into trouble\u201d but to ensure safety.",
      "Heller says there are a number of groups working to destigmatize drugs, promote decriminalization, and promote drug checking.",
      "\u201cWe already have drug checking happening in cities,\u201d she says. \u201cIt makes perfect sense to expand the settings where you would offer that to include music festivals. It's the same rationale. ... The issue is this idea of liability. You\u2019d have to create a law, essentially, that would protect the festival from liability.\u201d",

      "Jurors in Harvey Weinstein\u2019s sex crimes retrial appear to be focusing on one of his three accusers as they deliberate for a fourth day",
      "NEW YORK -- Jurors in Harvey Weinsteinn'ssex crimes retrial appeared to be focusing on one of his three accusers as deliberations stretched into a fourth day Tuesday, with no further sign of interpersonal tensions that flared earlier.",
      "The jury had requested to start off Tuesday with electronic copies of emails and other evidence pertaining to Jessica Mann \u2014 the accuser with arguably the most complex history with Weinstein. Jurors deliberated through the morning without sending any further requests.",
      "During days of testimony, Mann said the Oscar-winning movie producer raped her in 2013 amid a consensual relationship that continued for years afterward. Weinstein\u2019s lawyers emphasized that she kept seeing him, accepting invitations and sending warm messages to him. Mann said she \u201ccompartmentalized\u201d the pain he caused her.",
      "Weinstein, 73, has pleaded not guilty to all the charges in the case. In addition to the rape charge, he's accused of sexually assaulting two other women, Mimi Haley and Kaja Sokola.",
      "Weinstein didn't testify during the current trial, but maintained through his attorneys that he had completely consensual encounters with his accusers, who wanted his help building show business careers.",
      "Weinstein was one of the movie industry's most powerful figures until a series of sexual misconduct allegations against him became public in 2017, fueling the #MeToo movement and eventually leading to criminal charges.",
      "The jury is made up of seven women and five men. Their closed-door discussions began Thursday and apparently have been fractious at times.",
      "One juror asked Friday to be excused because he felt one member of the group was being treated unfairly. Then on Monday, the foreperson complained to the judge, prosecutors and defense lawyers that some jurors were \u201cpushing\" others to change their minds, talking about Weinstein's past and going beyond the charges.",
      "The foreperson didn't specify what was said. Trial evidence has included some testimony about allegations outside the scope of the current charges, such as mentions of the groundswell of claims against the ex-studio boss in 2017.",
      "Yet another juror soon asked to speak to the court, where she opined that things were \u201cgoing well.\u201d By the end of Monday, the jury as a whole said in a note that it was \u201cmaking good progress.\u201d",
      "There was progress Tuesday on at least one front: Jurors ultimately were given coffee, as requested, Judge Curtis Farber said. He hadn't initially thought the state court system could provide it.",
      "Weinstein originally was convicted in New York in 2020 of raping Mann and forcing oral sex on Haley. Sokola's allegation was added last year, after New York state's highest court overturned the 2020 conviction and sent the case back for retrial.",
      "Meanwhile, Weinstein is appealing a 2022 rape conviction in Los Angeles.",
      "The Associated Press generally does not identify people without their permission if they say they have been sexually assaulted. Sokola, Mann and Haley have agreed to be named.",

      "A Connecticut judge has settled a bitter feud over the estate of the late legendary blues guitarist Johnny Winter, ordering his managers to pay $226,000 in damages for improper payments they received after his 2014 death and rejecting their claim to the rights to his music.",
      "Relatives of Winter's late wife, Susan, sued Winter's manager, Paul Nelson, and his wife, Marion, in 2020, claiming the Nelsons swindled more than $1 million from Winter's music business. The Nelsons denied the allegations and countersued. They accused the relatives of improperly having Paul Nelson ousted as the beneficiary of Winter's estate, and they claimed ownership of his music rights.",
      "After a seven-day trial before a judge in January 2024, Judge Trial Referee Charles Lee ruled Friday that the Nelsons received improper payments and made improper withdrawals from Winter's accounts, but rejected claims they committed fraud, mismanagement and breach of contract.",
      "\u201cThe court finds that the conduct for which it has awarded the damages set forth above was negligent or at least arguably legitimate,\u201d Lee wrote in a 54-page decision that also rejected the claims in the Nelsons' countersuit.",
      "The judge said the Nelsons' most serious impropriety was withdrawing $112,000 from Winter's business account and depositing it into one of their own accounts in 2019, without listing Susan Winter as a signatory on their account. Susan Winter owned all of her husband's assets \u2014 valued at about $3 million at the time of his death. The judge said punitive damages may be imposed on the Nelsons because of that transfer.",
      "Paul Nelson, who managed Johnny Winter's business from 2005 to 2019 and played guitar in his band, died in March 2024 from a heart attack during a music tour. Marion Nelson, who did bookkeeping for the Winters and the music business, did not immediately return an email message Monday. The Nelsons' lawyers did not immediately return phone and email messages. It wasn't clear if they planned to appeal.",
      "Susan Winter died from lung cancer in October 2019. Months before her death, she removed Paul Nelson as her successor trustee to her family trust, which included all of her late husband's assets. She named her sister and brother, Bonnie and Christopher Warford, from Charlotte, North Carolina, as her new successor trustees, and they sued the Nelsons.",
      "The Warfords' lawyers did not immediately return phone and email messages Monday. Phone numbers for the Warfords listed in public records were no longer in service.",
      "The Nelsons claimed the Warfords took advantage of Susan Winter and had her sign legal documents while she was medicated near the end of her life. They also alleged the Warfords soured their relationship with Susan Winter with false embezzlement claims. The Warfords denied those allegations.",
      "The judge ruled that the Warfords were entitled to damages because of improper payments the Nelsons received, including $68,000 in royalty payments from a 2016 auction of Winter's assets, $69,000 in cash withdrawals, $18,000 in expense reimbursements and $15,000 in other royalty payments.",
      "The Warfords also were awarded $56,000 that remains in one of the Nelsons' accounts, the same account used in the $112,000 transfer criticized by the judge. In 2020, the Nelsons transferred about $151,000 out of that account to the Warfords\u2019 lawyers.",
      "Lee also rejected claims by the Warfords that Paul Nelson should not have received $300,000 in auction proceeds from the sale of three of Johnny Winter's guitars, because Winter promised those guitars to Paul Nelson.",
      "John Dawson Winter III was born and raised in Beaumont, Texas. He burst onto the world blues scene in the 1960s, dazzling crowds with his fast licks while his trademark long, white hair flew about from under his cowboy hat. He and his brother Edgar \u2014 both born with albinism \u2014 were both renowned musicians. Johnny Winter, who played at Woodstock in 1969, was inducted into the Blues Foundation Hall of Fame in 1988.",
      "Rolling Stone magazine listed him as the No. 63 best guitar player of all time in 2015. He released more than two dozen albums and was nominated for several Grammy Awards, winning his first one posthumously in 2015 for Best Blues Album for \u201cStep Back.\u201d Nelson produced the album and also took home a Grammy for it.",
      "Johnny Winter, who spent two decades living in Easton, Connecticut, before his death, battled heroin addiction for years and credited Nelson, whom he met in 1999, with helping him get off the opioid methadone and revive his career, according to the 2014 documentary, \u201cJohnny Winter: Down & Dirty.\u201d",

      "Trailblazing ballerina Misty Copeland has decided to move on to what she calls \u201cthe next stage\u201d in her career",
      "NEW YORK -- Ten years ago this month, Misty Copeland sat in front of a hastily arranged news conference at American Ballet Theatre, fighting back tears of pride over her new role: principal dancer.",
      "\u201cThis is it,\u201d she said, with emotion. \u201cThis has been my dream since I was 13.\u201d",
      "The occasion was highly unusual \u2014 normally, when a dancer is promoted, a brief press release is issued. But this was Copeland, a crossover star with fame far beyond the insular world of ballet. And now she was becoming the first Black female principal in the company\u2019s 75-year history \u2014 just days after her New York debut as the lead in \u201cSwan Lake\u201d brought a refreshingly diverse, packed audience to the Metropolitan Opera House.",
      "Now, a decade and many accomplishments later, Copeland is retiring from the company she joined as a teenager.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s been 25 years at ABT, and I think it\u2019s time,\u201d Copeland, 42, told the Associated Press last week ahead of Monday\u2019s official announcement of her move. \u201cIt\u2019s time for me to move to the next stage.\u201d",
      "The company is planning a splashy farewell on Oct. 22, featuring performances by Copeland \u2014 for the first time in five years \u2014 and other dancers. There will be speeches and film clips. And Copeland, who's been heavily involved in the planning, will get a chance to venture one more time onto that balcony in Verona; she\u2019ll dance again in the beautiful \u201cRomeo and Juliet\u201d pas de deux. Honorary chairs for the evening will be Caroline Kennedy and Oprah Winfrey.",
      "A lot has happened in a quarter-century. Copeland, whose success brought new energy to an art form that has always been overwhelmingly white, has authored a number of books, including a memoir and and several works for young people. The second installment of \u201cBunheads\u201d arrives in September, and more are already planned in a series she calls \u201ca reflection of my journey, showing the range of cultures and types of people that can be a part of the ballet world.\u201d",
      "Copeland has also made a short film with her production company. And her philanthropic organization, The Misty Copeland Foundation, works on increasing diversity in the dance world and giving more kids who grew up economically disadvantaged, like she did, the chance to dance.",
      "\u201cIt was so important for children growing up and seeing somebody like Misty and saying, \u2018Oh my gosh, she looks like I do,\u2019\u201d says Susan Jaffe, ABT\u2019s artistic director, who is overseeing the farewell performance. \u201cThrough her books, through her lectures, even her endorsements, she has really been a trailblazer.\"",
      "Still, progress moves slowly. When Copeland exits ABT, there will no longer be a Black female principal dancer at the company \u2014 nor at many ballet companies around the globe. Copeland discussed that continued challenge in the dance world, among other topics, in the AP interview last week. Remarks have been edited for clarity and brevity.",
      "COPELAND: You know, I\u2019ve become the person that I am today, and have all the opportunities I have today, because of ballet, (and) because of American Ballet Theatre. I feel like this is me saying thank you to the company. So it\u2019s a farewell. (But) it won\u2019t be the end of me dancing. \u2026 Never say never.",
      "COPELAND: I\u2019ve noticed that the conversation is not something we shy away from anymore in terms of the lack of equity, the lack of diversity in this (dance) world. That\u2019s one of the biggest shifts I\u2019ve seen \u2026 a lot of young people that just can imagine being part of it in some way. They can imagine stepping into Lincoln Center and being at the Metropolitan Opera House.",
      "COPELAND: It's definitely concerning, and I think I\u2019ve just gotten to a place in my career where there\u2019s only so much I can do on a stage. There\u2019s only so much that visual representation like that can do. I feel like it\u2019s the perfect timing for me to be stepping into a new role, and hopefully still shaping and shifting the ballet world and culture.",
      "COPELAND: I think about my partnership with (former ABT principal) Roberto Bolle and him giving me so many opportunities to travel the world with him \u2026 (Former ABT principal) Marcelo Gomes, he\u2019s been such a such a big part of my journey, and of course Herman Cornejo. We\u2019ve had a beautiful partnership throughout my career and I\u2019m excited to dance with him again (at the October farewell,)",
      "COPELAND: It\u2019s made me even more patient. I just have a lighter and brighter outlook on life because it\u2019s just such an incredible thing to experience and witness... I think ballet has prepared me for being a mother in so many ways. I think it\u2019s ... prepared me for life and being resilient and patient and sensitive and empathetic and strong, and all of these things.",
      "COPELAND: He doesn\u2019t understand at all! (laughs) He\u2019s seen very little of me dancing. \u2026 But he\u2019s very drawn to it. He is a mover. He\u2019s very athletic. He is so drawn to music. He started violin on Monday. We live in the museums. He really is drawn to art. I think he\u2019s definitely on the artist\u2019s track.",
      "COPELAND: It\u2019s been pretty evenly split between all of then. I think it just depends on what\u2019s at the forefront and what needs my focus. ... But it\u2019s exciting to be able to utilize dance in so many different mediums, and to me, that\u2019s how you get true diversity \u2014 by giving people different entry points into learning about dance and feeling like they can be a part of it, which has been my goal. How do I bring dance to as many people as possible in a way that really works for them?",
      "COPELAND: It\u2019s a difficult time. And I think all we can really do is keep our heads down and keep doing the work. \u2026 we\u2019re fortunate in that way that we\u2019ve built great relationships and can continue to do the work right now through my foundation. There\u2019s no way to stop the people that feel passionate about this work. We will continue doing it. It is so necessary for the well-being of our societies and communities. I think there are times to speak out and yell from the rooftops. And for me, I feel like this is a time to keep my head down and really stay focused and do the work.",

      "Cole Escola of \u201cOh, Mary!\u201d",
      "NEW YORK -- Even the ushers at Radio City Music Hall seemed thrilled to be in the room where it happened.",
      "A few of them could be seen grooving, like everyone else at Sunday\u2019s Tony Awards, to the \u201cHamilton\u201d reunion performance \u2014 a medley of some of that blockbuster musical\u2019s biggest songs, performed by the original cast. The occasion was the 10th Broadway anniversary of Lin-Manuel Miranda\u2019s juggernaut that spawned multiple touring companies, a West End production and a live-capture film \u2014 and is still going strong.",
      "But while the theater was buzzing to songs like \u201cMy Shot,\u201d \u201cThe Schuyler Sisters,\u201d \u201cHistory Has Its Eyes on You\u201d and \u201cThe Room Where It Happens,\u201d some people were unfortunately NOT in the room where, er, it was happening. They were the ones who\u2019d taken a trip to the bar or a stroll around the lobby, and were then held from entering until the next commercial break \u2014 missing perhaps the night\u2019s most anticipated highlight.",
      "They also missed the entire audience singing along with Jonathan Groff, aka King George, \u201cDa-da-da, dat-da, dat, da-da-da, da-ya-da, Da-da, dat, dat, da-ya-da.\u201d Note for next year: Exit at your own peril!",
      "Some other notable moments from Tony night:",
      "Most award winners thank Mom, their agents, their co-stars and their spouses.",
      "Cole Escola, one of the major stars of this Tony night, promised Mom a call, but also decided to thank \u201cTeebo from Grindr\u201d \u2014 the dating app \u2014 when accepting the award for lead actor in a play.",
      "Escola is star and writer of the riotous \u201cOh, Mary!\u201d \u2014 a reimagining of the life of Mary Todd Lincoln (and her beleaguered husband, Abe) that addresses the question: What if the Lincoln assassination wasn\u2019t such a bad thing for Mary? (Mary wants to be a cabaret star, you see.) The show is seeing audiences collapse in laughter for 80 minutes every night on Broadway.",
      "Escola, a downtown cabaret star, beat out high-wattage competitors like George Clooney and Daniel Dae Kim for the acting award. They mentioned their co-nominees in their speech, saying they had enjoyed sharing \u201cwarm salads\u201d at pre-awards lunches.",
      "Escola is the first nonbinary actor to win a Tony in the category.",
      "When \u201cMaybe Happy Ending\u201d writers Hue Park and Will Aronson accepted the award for best book of a musical, the first handed out, Park felt it necessary to point out that they weren\u2019t an actual couple. \u201cI am very much single,\u201d he clarified, for anyone wondering.",
      "Then later, when the duo won for best score, Park deemed a reminder necessary: \u201cBy the way, I\u2019m still single.\u201d",
      "And then at the end of the night, \u201cMaybe Happy Ending,\u201d the charming and quirky romance between decommissioned robots in a futuristic Korea, won the big prize: best musical. Park did not get the mic. But producer Jeffrey Richards did, and he reminded the crowd: \u201cHue is still single.\u201d",
      "Cynthia Erivo, the \u201cWicked\u201d star and powerhouse vocalist hosting the evening, said it first: \u201cAs they apparently say in a very fertile piece of intellectual property,\" she said with a wink, \u201cthere\u2019s no place like home. And Broadway has always been mine.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s a familiar theme on Tony night: the theater community as a welcoming haven for those who may feel different or unseen. It was echoed by Harvey Fierstein, winner of a lifetime achievement award, describing how he joined the theater after being welcomed by a company in Brooklyn. And it was expressed very emotionally by Nicole Scherzinger, winning best actress in a musical for \u201cSunset Blvd.\u201d",
      "\u201cGrowing up, I always felt like I didn\u2019t belong,\u201d said Scherzinger, former lead singer of the pop group Pussycat Dolls who plays Norma Desmond in the minimalist version of the Andrew Lloyd Webber show. \u201cBut you all have made me feel like I belong, and I have come home at last.\u201d Those last words echo the lyrics of one of Desmond\u2019s big numbers, \u201cAs If We Never Said Goodbye.\u201d",
      "\u201cSo if there\u2019s anyone out there who feels like they don\u2019t belong, or your time hasn\u2019t come, don\u2019t give up,\u201d Scherzinger continued. \u201cJust keep on giving and giving because the world needs your love and your light now more than ever.\u201d",
      "There\u2019s always lots of chatter going on during an awards show. But the way the crowd quieted down during Audra McDonald\u2019s powerful, agonized performance of \u201cRose\u2019s Turn\u201d from \u201cGypsy\u201d was striking. In the song's quiet moments, you heard utter silence in the vast room.",
      "McDonald, the Tonys' most awarded actor, is clearly revered by the theater community, who cheered her with standing ovations. But the award she was up for went to Scherzinger.",
      "It\u2019s been two years since HBO\u2019s \u201cSuccession\u201d ended, but its stars keep turning up at awards shows \u2014 and often winning. Jeremy Strong won a Tony last year and was nominated for an Oscar this year. Kieran Culkin won an Oscar this year and is appearing on Broadway this season, though he wasn\u2019t nominated. And now it was the turn of Sarah Snook \u2014 Emmy and Golden Globe winner \u2014 to win a Tony.",
      "Snook, who played mercurial sibling Shiv Roy in the series, took the Tony for best actress in a play for \u201cThe Picture of Dorian Gray,\u201d in which she plays all 26 roles.",
      "Tony winner and musical theater regular Gavin Creel, who died last year of cancer, was a friend to many in the theater community, and was remembered more than once on Tony evening.",
      "During the early pre-show, actor Celia Keenan-Bolger was honored with the Isabelle Stevenson award, for her advocacy work in the arts. She spoke movingly of her deep friendship with Creel and their advocacy work together.",
      "Later, singer and actor Sara Bareilles performed a soulful duet of \u201cTomorrow\u201d from \u201cAnnie,\u201d harmonizing with Erivo, during the memorial segment. That segment ended with a photo of Creel, also a dear friend to Bareilles, who teared up.",
      "Both Bareilles and Keenan-Bolger are involved with the Gavin Creel Fellowship, an initiative that plans to provide $25,000 grants to five emerging theater actors each year.",
      "The final award had been announced by presenter Miranda \u2014 best musical to \u201cMaybe Happy Ending\u201d \u2014 and the audience started to disperse. But Erivo had another idea.",
      "Riffing on the concept of leaving, she launched into the famous \u201cDreamgirls\u201d ballad \u201cAnd I Am Telling You I\u2019m Not Going\u201d \u2014 with rewritten lyrics.",
      "It was a yet another powerhouse performance from someone who has one of the best voices on the planet. The audience stopped dispersing \u2014 and started cheering.",

      "Every month, thousands of women thwart abortion bans in their home states by turning to telehealth clinics willing to prescribe pregnancy-ending drugs online and ship them anywhere in the country.",
      "Whether this is legal, though, is a matter of debate. Two legal cases involving a New York doctor could wind up testing the shield laws some states have passed to protect telehealth providers who ship abortion pills nationwide.",
      "Dr. Margaret Carpenter faces a felony charge in Louisiana for supplying abortion medication through the mail to a pregnant teen in that state. The patient's mother also faces criminal charges. A Texas judge fined the same physician $100,000 after the state accused her of prescribing abortion medication for a woman near Dallas.",
      "So far, the prosecution hasn't progressed thanks to New York's shield law, which has protected Carpenter from extradition to Louisiana. But other telehealth centers operating in states with similar legal protections for abortion providers are watching closely.",
      "\"We have great legal counsel who have advised us that what we are doing is legal,\u201d said Dr. Angel Foster, co-founder of The Massachusetts Medication Abortion Access Project, which is among a handful of telehealth providers that facilitate abortions from afar in states with bans.",
      "As more states consider enacting shield laws or expanding existing ones, whether one state can shield providers from liability for breaking another state's laws around abortion is still an unsettled area of law.",
      "Erik Baptist, senior counsel for the Alliance Defending Freedom, which opposes abortion, said shield laws violate a constitutional requirement that states respect the laws and legal judgments of other states.",
      "\"What these shield law states are doing are undermining the prerogative of these pro-life states to implement and enforce pro-life laws,\u201d said Baptist, director of the group\u2019s Center for Life. \u201dAnd so I think the Supreme Court ultimately will want to take this.\u201d",
      "\u201cThat is inherently a challenge with shield laws and telehealth,\u201d said Carmel Shachar, faculty director of the Health Law and Policy Clinic at Harvard Law School. \u201cAt a certain point, for the purposes of abortion bans, the courts will need to decide: Do we treat a telehealth abortion as happening within the state of the provider or within the state of the patient?\u201d",
      "Decades ago, the FDA approved the use of two prescription medicines \u2014 mifepristone and misoprostol \u2014 to terminate pregnancies.",

      "The Society of Family Planning, which supports abortion rights, said that between April and June 2024 there were an average of 7,700 telehealth abortions performed each month in states that either ban abortion totally or after six weeks of pregnancy.",
      "The prescribing process at telehealth clinics varies by provider, but usually takes place entirely online, with the patient answering a series of health-related questions and consent forms.",
      "At some telehealth clinics, medical providers don't come face-to-face with patients, even via videoconferencing, and patients don't necessarily know the prescriber's name unless requested.",
      "For instance, when Foster's clinic, also known as The MAP, puts pills in the mail, only the name of the practice appears on the label, as allowed under the Massachusetts shield law. If patients have follow-up questions, they can talk or text the doctor working that day, but may not know that doctor's name either.",

      "\u201cThis has been the safety net, post-Dobbs, of allowing people who don\u2019t have the ability to travel out of state to get abortion care,\u201d said Greer Donley, a University of Pittsburgh law professor and abortion law expert.",
      "When dealing with medications not related to abortion, doctors are often able to write prescriptions for patients in other states. However, in most states, if the patient is located within its borders, the doctor must have a license issued by that state, according to Mei Wa Kwong, executive director of the The Center for Connected Health Policy.",
      "Twenty three states and Washington, D.C., currently have shield laws protecting abortion providers.",
      "Of those, eight have specific provisions protecting them from criminal prosecution or civil lawsuits even if the patient is in another state, according to the nonprofit research organization KFF. They include California, Colorado, Maine, Massachusetts, New York, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington.",
      "Louisiana\u2019s request to extradite Carpenter hit a roadblock when New York Gov. Kathy Hochul rejected it, citing the state\u2019s shield law. (A county clerk also cited the shield law as he refused to file the civil judgment from Texas.)",
      "\u201cThese are not doctors providing health care. They are drug dealers,\u201d Republican Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill told state lawmakers as she promoted a bill that would expand who can sue and be sued in abortion medication cases. \u201cThey are violating our laws. They are sending illegal medications for purposes of procuring abortions that are illegal in our state.\u201d",
      "Julie Kay, the executive director of the Abortion Coalition for Telemedicine, the nationwide organization co-founded by Carpenter, said providers won\u2019t be \u201cbullied and intimidated\u201d into ceasing operations.",

    "story": [
      "U.S. Health Secretary Robert F",
      "NEW YORK -- U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. on Wednesday named eight new vaccine policy advisers to replace the panel that he abruptly dismissed earlier this week.",
      "They include a scientist who researched mRNA vaccine technology and became a conservative darling for his criticisms of COVID-19 vaccines, a leading critic of pandemic-era lockdowns, and a professor of operations management.",
      "Kennedy's decision to \u201cretire\u201d the previous 17-member Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices was widely decried by doctors' groups and public health organizations, who feared the advisers would be replaced by a group aligned with Kennedy's desire to reassess \u2014 and possibly end \u2014 longstanding vaccination recommendations.",
      "On Tuesday, before he announced his picks, Kennedy said: \u201cWe\u2019re going to bring great people onto the ACIP panel \u2013 not anti-vaxxers \u2013 bringing people on who are credentialed scientists.\u201d",
      "The new appointees include Vicky Pebsworth, a regional director for the National Association of Catholic Nurses, who has been listed as a board member and volunteer director for the National Vaccine Information Center, a group that is widely considered to be a leading source of vaccine misinformation.",
      "Another is Dr. Robert Malone, the former mRNA researcher who emerged as a close adviser to Kennedy during the measles outbreak. Malone, who runs a wellness institute and a popular blog, rose to prominence during the COVID-19 pandemic as he relayed conspiracy theories around the outbreak and the vaccines that followed. He has appeared on podcasts and other conservative news outlets where he\u2019s promoted unproven and alternative treatments for measles and COVID-19.",
      "He has claimed that millions of Americans were hypnotized into taking the COVID-19 shots and has suggested that those vaccines cause a form of AIDS. He\u2019s downplayed deaths related to one of the largest measles outbreaks in the U.S. in years.",
      "Other appointees include Dr. Martin Kulldorff, a biostatistician and epidemiologist who was a co-author of the Great Barrington Declaration, an October 2020 letter maintaining that pandemic shutdowns were causing irreparable harm. Dr. Cody Meissner, a former ACIP member, also was named.",
      "Abram Wagner of the University of Michigan\u2019s school of public health, who investigates vaccination programs, said he\u2019s not satisfied with the composition of the committee.",
      "\u201cThe previous ACIP was made up of technical experts who have spent their lives studying vaccines,\u201d he said. Most people on the current list \u201cdon\u2019t have the technical capacity that we would expect out of people who would have to make really complicated decisions involving interpreting complicated scientific data.\u201d",
      "He said having Pebsworth on the board is \u201cincredibly problematic\u201d since she is involved in an organization that \u201cdistributes a lot of misinformation.\u201d",
      "Kennedy made the announcement in a social media post on Wednesday.",
      "The committee, created in 1964, makes recommendations to the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. CDC directors almost always approve those recommendations on how vaccines that have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration should be used. The CDC\u2019s final recommendations are widely heeded by doctors and guide vaccination programs.",
      "The other appointees are:",
      "\u2014Dr. James Hibbeln, who formerly headed a National Institutes of Health group focused on nutritional neurosciences and who studies how nutrition affects the brain, including the potential benefits of seafood consumption during pregnancy.",
      "\u2014Retsef Levi, a professor of operations management at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who studies business issues related to supply chain, logistics, pricing optimization and health and health care management. In a 2023 video pinned to an X profile under his name, Levi called for the end of the COVID-19 vaccination program, claiming the vaccines were ineffective and dangerous despite evidence they saved millions of lives.",
      "\u2014Dr. James Pagano, an emergency medicine physician from Los Angeles.",
      "\u2014Dr. Michael Ross, a Virginia-based obstetrician and gynecologist.",
      "Of the eight named by Kennedy, perhaps the most experienced in vaccine policy is Meissner, an expert in pediatric infectious diseases at Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center, who has previously served as a member of both ACIP and the Food and Drug Administration\u2019s vaccine advisory panel.",
      "During his five-year term as an FDA adviser, the committee was repeatedly asked to review and vote on the safety and effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines that were rapidly developed to fight the pandemic. In September 2021, he joined the majority of panelists who voted against a plan from the Biden administration to offer an extra vaccine dose to all American adults. The panel instead recommended that the extra shot should be limited to seniors and those at higher risk of the disease.",
      "Ultimately, the FDA disregarded the panel\u2019s recommendation and OK\u2019d an extra vaccine dose for all adults.",
      "In addition to serving on government panels, Meissner has helped author policy statements and vaccination schedules for the American Academy of Pediatrics.",
      "ACIP members typically serve in staggered four-year terms, although several appointments were delayed during the Biden administration before positions were filled last year. The voting members all have scientific or clinical expertise in immunization, except for one \u201cconsumer representative\u201d who can bring perspective on community and social facets of vaccine programs.",
      "Kennedy, a leading voice in the anti-vaccine movement before becoming the U.S. government\u2019s top health official, has accused the committee of being too closely aligned with vaccine manufacturers and of rubber-stamping vaccines. ACIP policies require members to state past collaborations with vaccine companies and to recuse themselves from votes in which they had a conflict of interest, but Kennedy has dismissed those safeguards as weak.",
      "Most of the people who best understand vaccines are those who have researched them, which usually requires some degree of collaboration with the companies that develop and sell them, said Jason Schwartz, a Yale University health policy researcher.",
      "\u201cIf you are to exclude any reputable, respected vaccine expert who has ever engaged even in a limited way with the vaccine industry, you\u2019re likely to have a very small pool of folks to draw from,\u201d Schwartz said.",
      "The U.S. Senate confirmed Kennedy in February after he promised he would not change the vaccination schedule. But less than a week later, he vowed to investigate childhood vaccines that prevent measles, polio and other dangerous diseases.",
      "Kennedy has ignored some of the recommendations ACIP voted for in April, including the endorsement of a new combination shot that protects against five strains of meningococcal bacteria and the expansion of vaccinations against RSV.",
      "In late May, Kennedy disregarded the committee and announced the government would change the recommendation for children and pregnant women to get COVID-19 shots.",

      "Big changes are being are being proposed to a food aid program as part of President Donald Trump's tax-cut legislation",
      "TPresident Donald Trump's plan to cut taxes by trillions of dollars could also trim billions in spending from social safety net programs, including food aid for lower-income people.",
      "The proposed changes to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program would make states pick up more of the costs, require several million more recipients to work or lose their benefits, and potentially reduce the amount of food aid people receive in the future.",
      "The legislation, which narrowly passed the U.S. House, could undergo further changes in the Senate, where it's currently being debated. Trump wants lawmakers to send the \u201cOne Big Beautiful Bill Act\u201d to his desk by July 4, when the nation marks the 249th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence.",
      "Here's a look at the food aid program, by the numbers:",
      "The federal aid program formerly known as food stamps was renamed the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, on Oct. 1, 2008. The program provides monthly payments for food purchases to low-income residents generally earning less than $1,632 monthly for individuals, or $3,380 monthly for a household of four.",
      "The nation\u2019s first experiment with food stamps began in 1939. But the modern version of the program dates to 1979, when a change in federal law took effect eliminating a requirement that participants purchase food stamps. There currently is no cost to people participating in the program.",
      "A little over 42 million people nationwide received SNAP benefits in February, the latest month for which figures are available. That's roughly one out of every eight people in the county. Participation is down from a peak average of 47.6 million people during the 2013 federal fiscal year.",
      "Often, more than one person in a household is eligible for food aid. As of February, nearly 22.5 million households were enrolled SNAP, receiving an average monthly household benefit of $353.",
      "Legislation passed by the House is projected to cut about $295 billion of federal spending from SNAP over the next 10 years, according to the Congressional Budget Office.",
      "A little more than half of those federal savings would come by shifting costs to states, which administer SNAP. Nearly one-third of those savings would come by expanding a work requirement for some SNAP participants, which the CBO assumes would force some people off the rolls. Additional money would be saved by eliminating SNAP benefits for between 120,000 and 250,000 immigrants legally in the U.S. who are not citizens or lawful permanent residents.",
      "Another provision in the legislation would cap the annual inflationary growth in food benefits. As a result, the CBO estimates that the average monthly food benefit would be about $15 lower than it otherwise would have been by 2034.",
      "To receive SNAP benefits, current law says adults ages 18 through 54 who are physically and mentally able and don\u2019t have dependents would need to work, volunteer or participate in training programs for at least 80 hours a month. Those who don't do so are limited to just three months of benefits in a three-year period.",
      "The legislation that passed the House would expand work requirements to those ages 55 through 64. It also would extend work requirements to some parents without children younger than age 7. And it would limit the ability of states to waive work requirements in areas that lack sufficient jobs.",
      "The combined effect of those changes is projected by the CBO to reduce SNAP participation by a monthly average of 3.2 million people.",
      "The federal government currently splits the administrative costs of SNAP with states but covers the full cost of food benefits. Under the legislation, states would have to cover three-fourths of the administrative costs. States also would have to pay a portion of the food benefits starting with the 2028 fiscal year.",
      "All states would be required to pay at least 5% of the food aid benefits, and could pay more depending on how often they make mistakes with people\u2019s payments.",
      "States that had payment error rates between 6-8% in the most recent federal fiscal year for which data is available would have to cover 15% of the food costs. States with error rates between 8-10% would have to cover 20% of the food benefits, and those with error rates greater than 10% would have to cover 25% of the food costs.",
      "Many states could get hit with higher costs. The national error rate stood at 11.7% in the 2023 fiscal year, and just three states \u2014 Idaho, South Dakota and Vermont \u2014 had error rates below 5%. But the 2023 figures are unlikely to serve as the base year, so the exact costs to states remains unclear.",
      "As a result of the cost shift, the CBO assumes that some states would reduce or eliminate benefits for people.",
      "House Resolution 1, containing the SNAP changes and tax cuts, passed the House last month by a margin of just one vote \u2014 215-214.",
      "A vote also could be close in the Senate, where Republicans hold 53 of the 100 seats. Democrats did not support the bill in the House and are unlikely to do so in the Senate. Some Republican senators have expressed reservations about proposed cuts to food aid and Medicaid and the potential impact of the bill on the federal deficit. GOP Senate leaders may have to make some changes to the bill to ensure enough support to pass it.",

      "A top aide to Health Secretary Robert F",
      "WASHINGTON -- Calley Means has built a following within the \u201cMake America Healthy Again\u201d movement by railing against the failings of the U.S. health system, often pinning the blame on one issue: corruption.",
      "Means, a top aide to Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., was hired as a White House adviser in March. He has used that perch to attack the nation\u2019s leading physician groups, federal agencies and government scientists, claiming they only protect their own interests in the nation\u2019s $4.9 trillion-a-year industry.",
      "In recent interviews, speeches and podcasts he has called the American Medical Association \u201ca pharma lobbying group,\u201d labeled the Food and Drug Administration \u201ca sock puppet of industry,\" and said federal health scientists have \u201coverseen a record of utter failure.\u201d",
      "Means, however, has his own financial stake in the sprawling health system. He\u2019s the co-founder of an online platform, Truemed, that offers dietary supplements, herbal remedies and other wellness products. Some of the vendors featured on Truemed\u2019s website are supporters of Kennedy\u2019s MAHA movement, which downplays the benefits of prescription drugs, vaccines and other rigorously tested medical products.",
      "Kennedy has pledged to run the Department of Health and Human Services with \u201cradical transparency,\u201d but Means has never had to publicly disclose his own financial details or where exactly they intersect with the policies he's advancing.",
      "\u201cIt reeks of hypocrisy,\u201d said Dr. Reshma Ramachandran, a health researcher at Yale University. \u201cIn effect, he is representing another industry that is touting nonregulated products and using his platform within the government to financially benefit himself.\u201d",
      "In a written statement, Means said his government work has not dealt with matters affecting Truemed and has focused on issues like reforming nutrition programs and pressuring companies to phase out food dyes.",
      "\u201cPursuing these large-scale MAHA goals to make America healthy has been the sole focus in my government work,\u201d Means said.",
      "Truemed helps users take tax-free money out of their health savings accounts, or HSAs, to spend on things that wouldn\u2019t normally qualify as medical expenses, such as exercise equipment, meal delivery services and homeopathic remedies \u2014 mixtures of plants and minerals based on a centuries-old theory of medicine that's not supported by modern science.",
      "The business model caught the attention of the IRS last year, which issued an alert: \u201cBeware of companies misrepresenting nutrition, wellness and general health expenses as medical care.\u201d",
      "Truemed co-founder and CEO, Justin Mares, said in a statement the company is \u201cin full alignment\u201d with IRS guidelines.",
      "\u201cTruemed enables patients to work with providers to use medical funds for root cause interventions like exercise and vitamin D to reverse disease under current law,\u201d Mares said.",
      "The full extent of Means\u2019 potential conflicts \u2014 including his personal investments\u2014 are unclear because of his status as a special government employee.",
      "Unlike presidential appointees and other senior officials, special government employees are temporary staffers who do not have to leave companies or sell investments that could be impacted by their work. Also, their financial disclosure forms are shielded from public release.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a big problem,\u201d says Richard Painter, a former White House ethics lawyer under George W. Bush now at the University of Minnesota. Painter and other experts have raised alarms over a whirlwind of Trump administration actions to dismantle the government\u2019s public integrity guardrails.",
      "Still, part-time government employees are subject to the same law that bars all federal staffers from working on issues that could directly benefit their finances. When such cases arise, they must recuse themselves or risk criminal penalties.",
      "Means regularly opines on matters before HHS, including rethinking the use of drugs for depression, weight loss, diabetes and other conditions. Recently he's been promoting a new government report that calls for scaling back prescription medications in favor of exercise, dietary changes and other alternatives.",
      "\u201cIf we rely less on our medical system, less on drugs, it necessitates the spiritual, cultural conversation about what we\u2019re doing to our children\u2019s bodies,\u201d Means said in a recent podcast appearance.",
      "Experts note that government ethics rules are intended to both prevent financial conflict violations, but also the appearance of such conflicts that might undermine public trust in government.",
      "\u201cIf I were running the ethics office over at HHS, I sure as heck wouldn\u2019t want anybody going around giving interviews and speeches about government matters that could have an effect on their own financial interests,\u201d Painter said.",
      "Means\u2019 rapid rise reflects the seeming contradictions within the MAHA movement itself, which urges followers to distrust both big corporations and the government agencies which regulate them.",
      "Means rails against big pharma and food conglomerates, two industries that he says he spent years working for as a consultant in Washington.",
      "Means has no medical training. A graduate of Harvard Business School, he previously ran a bridal gown startup with his wife. On Wednesday, he's scheduled to be the keynote speaker at FDA's annual science forum, according to a copy of the program shared with The Associated Press.",
      "He traces his passion for health care reform to the death of his mother from pancreatic cancer in 2021. Shortly thereafter, Means and his sister, Dr. Casey Means, took psychedelics together and had \u201ca mind-blowing, life-changing experience,\u201d which led them to co-author a wellness book, launch separate health startups and begin appearing on podcasts.",
      "Casey Means was recently nominated to be surgeon general and has faced scrutiny over her qualifications, including an unfinished medical residency.",
      "Asked about her nomination, President Donald Trump said: \u201cBobby thought she was fantastic,\u201d adding that he did not know her.",
      "Meanwhile, her brother has stepped up his rhetoric for the MAHA agenda, recently declaring that Kennedy has \u201ca spiritual mandate to reform our broken system.\"",
      "While promoting the administration\u2019s accomplishments, Means does not shy away from plugging his own brand or those of his business partners.",
      "When asked to offer health advice to listeners of a sports podcast, Outkick The Show, in April, Means said: \u201cRead our book, \u2018Good Energy.\u2019\u201d",
      "He also recommended blood tests sold by Function Health, which provides subscription-based testing for $500 annually. The company was cofounded by Dr. Mark Hyman, a friend of Kennedy and an investor in Truemed, which also offers Hyman's supplements through its platform. Casey Means is also an investor in Hyman's company.",
      "\u201cIf you\u2019re sick, most likely you have some kind of nutrient deficiency, some kind of biomarker that you can actually then target with your diet and your supplements,\u201d Calley Means said.",
      "Like dietary supplements, the marketing claims on laboratory tests sold by Hyman are not approved by the FDA. The agency has warned for years about the accuracy of such tests and tried to start regulating them under President Joe Biden.",
      "Experts say MAHA entrepreneurs like Hyman are following a playbook common to the wellness industry: Identify a health concern, market a test to diagnose it and then sell supplements or other remedies to treat it.",
      "\u201cIt ends up favoring these products and services that rest on flimsy grounds, at the expense of products that have actually survived a rigorous FDA approval process,\u201d said Dr. Peter Lurie, a former FDA official who is now president of the Center for Science in the Public Interest.",
      "Many of the items sold via Truemed, including sweat tents, cold plunge tanks and light therapy lamps, wouldn\u2019t typically qualify as medical expenses under rules for HSAs, tax-free accounts created by Congress to manage medical costs.",
      "The IRS generally states that HSA purchases must help diagnose, cure, treat, mitigate or prevent disease.",
      "Truemed allows users to request a \u201cletter of medical necessity\u201d from a doctor, stating that the product in question could have medical value for them. Like other telehealth services, there\u2019s usually no real-time communication with the patient. The physician reviews a \u201csimple survey solution,\u201d filled out by the Truemed user, according to the company\u2019s website.",
      "Industry representatives say customers should be careful.",
      "\u201cYou need to be prepared to defend your spending habits under audit,\u201d said Kevin McKechnie, head of the American Bankers Association\u2019s HSA council. \u201cCompanies are popping up suggesting they can help you manage that process and maybe they can \u2014 so the debate continues.\u201d",
      "Americans have an estimated $147 billion in HSA accounts, a potential windfall for companies like Truemed that collects fees for transactions made using their platforms.",
      "Means sees an even bigger opportunity \u2014 routing federal funds out of government programs and into more HSAs.",
      "\u201cThe point of our company is to steer medical dollars into flexible spending,\u201d Means told fitness celebrity Jillian Michaels, on her podcast last year. \u201cI want to get that $4.5 trillion of Medicare, Medicaid, everything into a flexible account.\u201d",
      "Means\u2019 pitch for expanding HSAs echoes two decades of Republican talking points on the accounts, which were created in 2003 to encourage Americans in high-deductible plans to be judicious with their health dollars.",
      "But HSAs have not brought down spending, economists say. They are disproportionately used by the wealthiest Americans, who have more income to fund them and a bigger incentive to lower their tax rate.",
      "Americans who earn more than $1 million annually are the group most likely to make regular HSA contributions, according to an analysis by the nonprofit Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. More than half Americans with HSAs have balances less than $500.",
      "Trump\u2019s \u201cOne Big Beautiful Bill\u201d would further expand HSA purchases, making gym memberships and other fitness expenses eligible for tax-free spending. That provision alone is expected to cost the government $10 billion in revenue.",
      "\u201cThese are really just tax breaks in the guise of health policy that overwhelmingly benefit people with high incomes,\u201d said Gideon Lukens, a former White House budget official during the Obama and Trump administrations, now with the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.",
      "Expanding HSA eligibility was listed as a goal for a coalition of MAHA entrepreneurs and Truemed partners, founded by Means, which lobbied Congress last year, according to the group's website.",
      "Means said in a statement that the group focused only on broad topics like \u201chealth care incentives and patient choice \u2014 but did not lobby for specific bills.\u201d",
      "In total, the HSA expansions in Trump's bill are projected to cost the federal government $180 billion over the next 10 years. As HSAs expand to include more disparate products and services, Lukens says the U.S. government will have fewer dollars to expand medical coverage through programs like Medicaid.",
      "\u201cWe have a limited amount of federal resources and the question is whether we want to spend that on health and wellness products that may or may not be helpful for wealthy people,\u201d Lukens said.",

      "WASHINGTON -- In his confirmation hearings to lead the National Institutes of Health, Jay Bhattacharya pledged his openness to views that might conflict with his own. \u201cDissent,\" he said, \u201dis the very essence of science.\u201d",
      "That commitment is being put to the test.",
      "On Monday, scores of scientists at the agency sent their Trump-appointed leader a letter titled the Bethesda Declaration, challenging \u201cpolicies that undermine the NIH mission, waste public resources, and harm the health of Americans and people across the globe.\u201d",
      "It says: \"We dissent.\"",
      "In a capital where insiders often insist on anonymity to say such things publicly, 92 NIH researchers, program directors, branch chiefs and scientific review officers put their signatures on the letter \u2014 and their careers on the line. An additional 250 of their colleagues across the agency endorsed the declaration without using their names.",
      "The four-page letter, addressed to Bhattacharya, also was sent to Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and members of Congress who oversee the NIH. White House spokesman Kush Desai defended the administration's approach to federal research and said President Donald Trump is focused on restoring a \u201cGold Standard\u201d of science, not \u201cideological activism.\u201d",
      "The signers went public in the face of a \u201cculture of fear and suppression\u201d they say Trump's administration has spread through the federal civil service. \u201cWe are compelled to speak up when our leadership prioritizes political momentum over human safety and faithful stewardship of public resources,\u201d the declaration says.",
      "Bhattacharya responded to the declaration by saying it \u201chas some fundamental misconceptions about the policy directions the NIH has taken in recent months.\"",
      "\u201cNevertheless, respectful dissent in science is productive,\u201d he said in a statement. \"We all want the NIH to succeed.\u201d",
      "Named for the agency's headquarters location in Maryland, the Bethesda Declaration details upheaval in the world\u2019s premier public health research institution over the course of mere months.",
      "It addresses the termination of 2,100 research grants valued at more than $12 billion and some of the human costs that have resulted, such as cutting off medication regimens to participants in clinical trials or leaving them with unmonitored device implants.",
      "In one case, an NIH-supported study of multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis in Haiti had to be stopped, ceasing antibiotic treatment mid-course for patients.",
      "In a number of cases, trials that were mostly completed were rendered useless without the money to finish and analyze the work, the letter says. \u201cEnding a $5 million research study when it is 80% complete does not save $1 million,\u201d it says, \u201cit wastes $4 million.\u201d",
      "Jenna Norton, who oversees health disparity research at the agency's National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, recently appeared at a forum by Sen. Angela Alsobrooks, D-Md., to talk about what's happening at the NIH.",

      "\u201cI want people to know how bad things are at NIH,\" Norton told The Associated Press.",
      "The signers said they modeled their indictment after Bhattacharya\u2019s Great Barrington Declaration in 2020, when he was a professor at Stanford University Medical School.",
      "His declaration drew together likeminded infectious disease epidemiologists and public health scientists who dissented from what they saw as excessive COVID-19 lockdown policies and felt ostracized by the larger public health community that pushed those policies, including the NIH.",
      "\u201cHe is proud of his statement, and we are proud of ours,\" said Sarah Kobrin, a branch chief at the NIH's National Cancer Institute who signed the Bethesda Declaration.",
      "As chief of the Health Systems and Interventions Research Branch, Kobrin provides scientific oversight of researchers across the country who've been funded by the cancer institute or want to be. Cuts in personnel and money have shifted her work from improving cancer care research to what she sees as minimizing its destruction. \"So much of it is gone \u2014 my work,\u201d she said.",
      "The 21-year NIH veteran said she signed because she didn't want to be \"a collaborator\u201d in the political manipulation of biomedical science.",
      "Ian Morgan, a postdoctoral fellow with the National Institute of General Medical Sciences, also signed the declaration. \u201cWe have a saying in basic science,\u201d he said. \u201cYou go and become a physician if you want to treat thousands of patients. You go and become a researcher if you want to save billions of patients.",
      "\u201cWe are doing the research that is going to go and create the cures of the future,\u201d he added. But that won\u2019t happen, he said, if Trump's Republican administration prevails with its searing grant cuts.",
      "The NIH employees interviewed by the AP emphasized they were speaking for themselves and not for their institutes nor the NIH.",
      "Employees from all 27 NIH institutes and centers gave their support to the declaration. Most who signed are intimately involved with evaluating and overseeing extramural research grants.",
      "The letter asserts \u201cNIH trials are being halted without regard to participant safety\u201d and the agency is shirking commitments to trial participants who \u201cbraved personal risk to give the incredible gift of biological samples, understanding that their generosity would fuel scientific discovery and improve health.\u201d",
      "The Trump administration has gone at public health research on several fronts, both directly, as part of its broad effort to root out diversity, equity and inclusion values throughout the bureaucracy, and as part of its drive to starve some universities of federal money.",
      "At the White House, Desai said Americans \u201chave lost confidence in our increasingly politicized healthcare and research apparatus that has been obsessed with DEI and COVID, which the majority of Americans moved on from years ago.\u201d",
      "This has forced \u201cindiscriminate grant terminations, payment freezes for ongoing research, and blanket holds on awards regardless of the quality, progress, or impact of the science,\u201d the declaration says.",

      "With that in place, he said in a statement in April, \u201cNIH scientists can be certain they are afforded the ability to engage in open, academic discourse as part of their official duties and in their personal capacities without risk of official interference, professional disadvantage or workplace retaliation.\"",

      "The Trump administration's Environmental Protection Agency is taking aim at dozens of rules aimed at protecting the environment, including one that requires big polluters to report greenhouse gas emissions",
      "LEOPOLD, Ind. -- On the ceiling of Abbie Brockman\u2019s middle school English classroom in Perry County, the fluorescent lights are covered with images of a bright blue sky, a few clouds floating by.",
      "Outside, the real sky isn\u2019t always blue. Sometimes it\u2019s hazy, with pollution drifting from coal-fired power plants in this part of southwest Indiana. Knowing exactly how much, and what it may be doing to the people who live there, is why Brockman got involved with a local environmental organization that\u2019s installing air and water quality monitors in her community.",
      "\u201cIndustry and government is very, very, very powerful. It\u2019s more powerful than me. I\u2019m just an English teacher,\u201d Brockman said. But she wants to feel she can make a difference.",
      "In a way, Brockman\u2019s monitoring echoes the reporting that the Environmental Protection Agency began requiring from large polluters more than a decade ago. Emissions from four coal-fired plants in southwest Indiana have dropped 60% since 2010, when the rule took effect.",
      "That rule is now on the chopping block, one of many that President Donald Trump\u2019s EPA argues is costly and burdensome for industry.",
      "But experts say dropping the requirement risks a big increase in emissions if companies are no longer publicly accountable for what they put in the air. And they say losing the data \u2014 at the same time the EPA is cutting air quality monitoring elsewhere \u2014 would make it tougher to fight climate change.",
      "At stake is the Greenhouse Gas Reporting program, a 2009 rule from President Barack Obama's administration that affects large carbon polluters like refineries, power plants, wells and landfills. In the years since, they've collectively reported a 20% drop in emissions, mostly driven by the closure of coal plants.",
      "And what happens at these big emitters makes a difference. Their declining emissions account for more than three-quarters of the overall, if modest, decline in all U.S. greenhouse gas emissions since 2010.",
      "The registry includes places not usually thought of as big polluters but that have notable greenhouse gas emissions, such as college campuses, breweries and cereal factories. Even Walt Disney World in Florida, where pollution dropped 62% since 2010, has to report along with nearly 10,600 other places.",
      "\"We can\u2019t solve climate change without knowing how much pollution major facilities are emitting and how that\u2019s changing over time,\" said Jeremy Symons, a former EPA senior climate adviser now at Environmental Protection Network, an organization of ex-EPA officials that monitors environmental policies. The group provided calculations as a part of The Associated Press' analysis of impacts from proposed rule rollbacks.",
      "Symons said some companies would welcome the end of the registry because it would make it easier to pollute.",
      "It\u2019s not clear how much the registry itself has contributed to declining emissions. More targeted regulations on smokestack emissions, as well as coal being crowded out by cheaper and less polluting natural gas, are bigger factors.",
      "But the registry \u201cdoes put pressure on companies to ... document what they\u2019ve done or at least to provide a baseline for what they\u2019ve done,\u201d said Stanford University climate scientist Rob Jackson, who heads Global Carbon Project, a group of scientists that tally national carbon emissions yearly.",
      "Gina McCarthy, a former EPA administrator under Obama, said the registry makes clear how power plants are doing against each other, and that's an inducement to lower emissions.",
      "\"It is money for those companies. It's costs. It's reputation. It's been, I think, a wonderful success story and I hope it continues.\u201d",
      "The potential end of the reporting requirement comes as experts say much of the country's air goes unmonitored. Nelson Arley Roque, a Penn State professor who co-authored a study in April on these \u201cmonitoring deserts,\u201d said about 40% of U.S. lands are unmonitored. That often includes poor and rural neighborhoods.",
      "\"The air matters to all of us, but apparently 50 million people can\u2019t know or will never know'' how bad the air is, Roque said.",
      "The EPA is also trying to claw back money that had been earmarked for air monitoring, part of the termination of grants that it has labeled as targeting diversity, equity and inclusion. That includes $500,000 that would have funded 40 air monitors in a low-income and minority community in the Charlotte, North Carolina, area.",
      "CleaneAIRE NC, a nonprofit that works to improve air quality across the state that was awarded the grant, is suing.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not diversity, equity and inclusion. It\u2019s human rights,\u201d said Daisha Wall, the group's community science program manager. \u201cWe all deserve a right to clean air.\u201d",
      "Research strongly links poor air quality to diseases like asthma and heart disease, with a slightly less established link to cancer. Near polluting industries, experts say what\u2019s often lacking is either enough data in specific locations or the will to investigate the health toll.",
      "Indiana says it \u201cmaintains a robust statewide monitoring and assessment program for air, land and water,\u201d but Brockman and others in this part of the state aren't satisfied. She and other members of local advocacy groups Southwestern Indiana Citizens for Quality of Life and Valley Watch install and maintain their own air and water quality monitors. It\u2019s a full-time job to keep the network of monitors up and running, fighting spotty Wi-Fi and connectivity issues.",
      "Fighting industry is a sensitive subject, Brockman added. Many families depend on jobs at coal-fired power plants, and poverty is real. She keeps snacks in her desk for the kids who haven\u2019t eaten breakfast.",
      "\u201cBut you also don\u2019t want to hear of another student that has a rare cancer,\u201d she said.",

      "GRAZ, Austria -- The former student who killed nine students and a teacher at a school in Austria and then took his own life planned the attack in detail, but he appears to have shot his victims at random and investigators still haven't been able to ascertain his motive, officials said Thursday.",
      "The 21-year-old had left the BORG Dreiersch\u00fctzengasse high school in Graz three years ago, breaking off his studies after attending for three years, police said. They said they knew of no personal connection between the gunman and the students he shot, but that one of the two teachers he shot had once taught him. They were still investigating whether that was a factor.",
      "The attack prompted Austria to declare three days of national mourning, and large numbers of candles have been laid in Graz's main square and outside the school.",
      "The assailant, an Austrian who lived with his mother near Graz and whom officials have declined to identify, used a Mercury double-barreled shotgun and a Glock 19 handgun in the shooting. Michael Lohnegger, the head of Styria province's criminal police office, said that he arrived at the school Tuesday morning with a backpack containing the weapons, and put on equipment including shooting glasses and a headset in a bathroom before starting a roughly seven-minute shooting spree.",
      "He opened fire indiscriminately on the building's third floor before shooting open the locked door of a fourth-floor classroom and again firing indiscriminately, Lohnegger told a news conference. Lohnegger said that he had enough ammunition to continue shooting and it was unclear why he hadn't; the assailant then returned to the bathroom and shot himself fatally in the head.",
      "A search of his home uncovered a farewell letter and video, which Lohnegger said added up to \u201can apology directed to his family for the crime and a general thank-you,\u201d but offered no \u201cindication for a motive.\u201d",
      "They also found a handwritten note that showed he had planned the attack \u201cdown to the smallest detail\" \u2014 setting out how he would proceed, but giving no date for the crime. It suggested that he had lacked enough time to build a fully functional pipe bomb, and investigators found one that wouldn't have worked.",
      "Lohnegger said a picture had emerged of \u201ca very introverted person\u201d who largely didn't take part in real-world activities, and that his great passion was taking part in online first-person shooter games.",
      "\u201cBut even here, there is no information from his personal surroundings that he ever expressed any anger or resentment toward the school, students or teachers,\u201d he added. The man had no previous police record and \u201cthere were definitely no particular problems with him at this school.\u201d",
      "The shooter was in unspecified vocational training at the time of the attack, investigators said.",
      "He had bought the shotgun legally in Graz in early April, and the handgun from another shop in the city in late May. He had a license to own weapons that required a report from a psychological expert, which apparently was produced in March.",
      "Starting in March, he took part in shooting practice five times at a shooting club in Graz, using a hired firearm, Lohnegger said.",
      "The slain students were six girls and three boys aged between 14 and 17. Eleven people were wounded in the attack, and authorities said on Wednesday that their lives weren't in danger.",

      "Japan and China are blaming each other after Tokyo raised concern that a Chinese fighter jet came dangerously close to Japanese reconnaissance planes",
      "TOKYO -- Japan and China blamed each other on Thursday after Tokyo raised concern that a Chinese fighter jet came dangerously close to Japanese reconnaissance planes.",
      "The Chinese fighter jets took off from one of two Chinese aircraft carriers that were operating together for the first time in the Pacific, Japan's Defense Ministry said.",
      "Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi told reporters that Japan conveyed its \u201cserious concern\u201d to China that such close encounters could cause accidental collisions.",
      "According to Japan, a Chinese J-15 fighter jet took off from the Shandong aircraft carrier on Saturday and chased a Japanese P-3C aircraft on reconnaissance duty, coming within an \u201cabnormally close distance\u201d of 45 meters (50 yards) for about 40 minutes.",
      "A Chinese jet also crossed 900 meters (980 yards) in front of a Japanese P-3C for about 80 minutes on Sunday, the ministry said.",
      "Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian defended China's activities as being fully consistent with international law and practices, and blamed Japanese vessels and airplanes for conducting close reconnaissance of China's military activities.",
      "The incidents occurred in the Pacific, where Japan's Self-Defense Force spotted the two carriers, the Shandong and the Liaoning, almost simultaneously operating near southern Japanese islands for the first time.",
      "Aircraft carriers are critical to projecting power at a distance. China routinely sends coast guard vessels, warships and warplanes around disputed East China Sea islands, but now they also reach as far as Guam, a U.S. Pacific territory with military bases.",
      "Both Chinese carriers operated in waters off Iwo Jima, about 1,200 kilometers (750 miles) south of Tokyo. The Liaoning also sailed inside Japan\u2019s exclusive economic zone near Minamitorishima, the country\u2019s easternmost island, Japan's Defense Minister Gen Nakatani said. There was no violation of Japanese territorial waters, he said.",

      "The Indian Coast Guard is attempting to tow a container ship that caught fire off the coast of Kerala in southern India earlier this week to prevent a potential ecological disaster",
      "NEW DELHI -- The Indian Coast Guard was attempting to tow a container ship that caught fire off the coast of Kerala in southern India earlier this week to prevent a potential ecological disaster, Indian authorities said Thursday.",
      "The Singapore-flagged MV Wan Hai 503 was on its way to Mumbai, India\u2019s financial capital, from the Sri Lankan port of Colombo on June 7 when it reported multiple explosions and a subsequent fire some 88 nautical miles from the coast of Beypore in Kerala on Monday.",
      "Indian authorities have not yet given a reason for the explosions and fire. Officials were focused on firefighting and preventing the vessel from drifting towards the Indian coastline.",
      "The 890-foot vessel carried 2,128 metric tons of fuel and hundreds of containers, including hazardous cargo, India\u2019s defense ministry said in a statement on Wednesday night.",
      "\u201cWith the fire yet to be fully extinguished, efforts to establish a towline to pull the vessel away from the coast are underway,\" the ministry said. \u201cThe situation remains critical and is being monitored continuously.\u201d",
      "The firefighting efforts have significantly reduced visible flames, but the fire remains active on the ship's inner decks and near the fuel tanks, the ministry added.",
      "Around 40% of the fire onboard the ship has been brought under control and the vessel remains afloat, according to a situation report by India\u2019s Directorate General of Shipping.",
      "The coast guard launched an aerial firefighting operation Thursday morning using a helicopter from the Indian air force, Commandant Amit Uniyal, a spokesperson for the coast guard, said. The helicopter dispersed 1,000 kilograms of dry chemical powder onto the core fire areas of the ship, he added.",
      "Shipping official Captain Harinder Singh told The Associated Press the vessel was carrying a total of 1,754 containers, including 143 with cargo deemed dangerous by the International Maritime Dangerous Goods Code, such as flammable liquids, toxic substances and solid hazardous materials.",
      "The explosions and subsequent fire caused dozens of the ship's containers to fall into the Arabian Sea.",
      "The coast guard on Wednesday airdropped five people onboard the unaffected stern of the ship to coordinate towing operations and assess the overall fire situation.",
      "The coast guard successfully established a towline from the vessel to a coast guard ship to control its drift.",
      "Singh, who is closely coordinating the operation, said authorities were working to establish a second towline with Offshore Warrior, a more powerful offshore supply ship with greater towing capabilities. Towing is expected to commence later Thursday.",
      "The salvage master onboard the ship observed hydrocarbon vapors which indicates possible heat transfer near fuel tanks, the report said.",
      "The vessel is managed by Singapore-based Wan Hai Lines. Of the 22 crew members onboard, 18 abandoned the ship with assistance from the navy and coast guard. Four are still missing.",
      "The navy and coast guard have launched a search operation for the missing, aided by two Dornier aircrafts. The navy uses Dornier aircraft primarily for maritime surveillance, search and rescue operations. Five ships have also been sent to help put out the fire.",
      "Last month, a container vessel sank in another accident off the Kerala coast, releasing 100 cargo containers into the Arabian Sea, and leaving authorities in the state scrambling to contain an oil spill.",

      "The attack on the border area was the latest twist in Sudan\u2019s civil war which erupted in April 2023 when tensions between the Sudanese army and RSF exploded with street battles in the capital, Khartoum that quickly spread across the country.",
      "The war has killed at least 24,000 people, though the number is likely far higher. It has driven about 13 million people from their homes, including 4 million who crossed into neighboring countries. It created the world's worst humanitarian crisis, and parts of the country have been pushed into famine.",
      "The fighting has been marked by atrocities including mass rape and ethnically motivated killings that amount to war crimes and crimes against humanity, especially in Darfur, according to the U.N. and international rights groups.",

      "Australian Defense Minister Richard Marles told Sky News Australia that he had known about the review of the deal \u201cfor some time,\" saying that it was a \u201cvery natural step for the incoming administration to take.\u201d",
      "He noted that the UK's government also reviewed the deal, the centerpiece of a three-way alliance known as AUKUS after it was elected, and that his own government had looked at it as part of its own review of Australia's entire defense posture.",

      "A Pakistani crackdown on Afghans has seen some families handed deadlines of hours, or just minutes, to collect whatever they can and leave forever",
      "TORKHAM, Afghanistan -- The order was clear and indisputable, the timeline startling. You have 45 minutes to pack up and leave Pakistan forever.",
      "Sher Khan, a 42-year-old Afghan, had returned home from his job in a brick factory. He stared at the plainclothes policeman on the doorstep, his mind reeling. How could he pack up his whole life and leave the country of his birth in under an hour?",
      "In the blink of an eye, the life he had built was taken away from him. He and his wife grabbed a few kitchen items and whatever clothes they could for themselves and their nine children. They left everything else behind at their home in Pakistan-controlled Kashmir.",
      "Born in Pakistan to parents who fled the 1979 Soviet invasion of Afghanistan and the ensuing war, Khan is one of hundreds of thousands of Afghans who have now been expelled.",
      "The nationwide crackdown, launched in October 2023, on foreigners Pakistan says are living in the country illegally has led to the departures of almost 1 million Afghans already.",
      "Pakistan says millions more remain. It wants them gone.",
      "\u201cAll our belongings were left behind,\u201d Khan said as he stood in a dusty, windswept refugee camp just across the Afghan border in Torkham, the first stop for expelled refugees. \u201cWe tried so hard (over the years) to collect the things that we had with honor.\u201d",
      "Pakistan set several deadlines earlier this year for Afghans to leave or face deportation. Afghan Citizen Card holders had to leave the capital Islamabad and Rawalpindi city by March 31, while those with Proof of Registration could stay until June 30. No specific deadlines were set for Afghans living elsewhere in Pakistan.",
      "Khan feared that delaying his departure beyond the deadline might have resulted in his wife and children being hauled off to a police station along with him a blow to his family\u2019s dignity.",
      "\u201cWe are happy that we came (to Afghanistan) with modesty and honor,\u201d he said. As for his lost belongings, \u201cGod may provide for them here, as He did there.\u201d",
      "At the Torkham camp, run by Afghanistan\u2019s Taliban government, each family receives a SIM card and 10,000 Afghanis ($145) in aid. They can spend up to three days there before having to move on.",
      "The camp\u2019s director, Molvi Hashim Maiwandwal, said some 150 families were arriving daily from Pakistan \u2014 far fewer than the roughly 1,200 families who were arriving about two months ago. But he said another surge was expected after the three-day Islamic holiday of Eid Al-Adha that started June 7.",
      "Aid organizations inside the camp help with basic needs, including healthcare. Local charity Aseel provides hygiene kits and helps with food. It has also set up a food package delivery system for families once they arrive at their final destination elsewhere in Afghanistan.",
      "Aseel\u2019s Najibullah Ghiasi said they expected a surge in arrivals \u201cby a significant number\u201d after Eid. \u201cWe cannot handle all of them, because the number is so huge,\u201d he said, adding the organization was trying to boost fundraising so it could support more people.",
      "Pakistan accuses Afghans of staging militant attacks inside the country, saying assaults are planned from across the border \u2014 a charge Kabul\u2019s Taliban government denies.",
      "Pakistan denies targeting Afghans, and maintains that everyone leaving the country is treated humanely and with dignity. But for many, there is little that is humane about being forced to pack up and leave in minutes or hours.",
      "Iran, too, has been expelling Afghans, with the UNHCR, the UN\u2019s refugee agency, saying on June 5 that 500,000 Afghans had been forced to leave Iran and Pakistan in the two months since April 1.",
      "Rights groups and aid agencies say authorities are pressuring Afghans into going sooner.",
      "In April, Human Rights Watch said police had raided houses, beaten and arbitrarily detained people, and confiscated refugee documents, including residence permits. Officers demanded bribes to allow Afghans to remain in Pakistan, the group added.",
      "Fifty-year-old Yar Mohammad lived in Pakistan-controlled Kashmir for nearly 45 years. The father of 12 built a successful business polishing floors, hiring several workers. Plainclothes policemen knocked on his door too. They gave him six hours to leave.",
      "\u201cNo way a person can wrap up so much business in six hours, especially if they spent 45 years in one place,\u201d he said. Friends rushed to his aid to help pack up anything they could: the company\u2019s floor-polishing machines, some tables, bed-frames and mattresses, and clothes.",
      "Now all his household belongings are crammed into orange tents in the Torkham refugee camp, his hard-earned floor-polishing machines outside and exposed to the elements. After three days of searching, he managed to find a place to rent in Kabul.",
      "\u201cI have no idea what we will do,\u201d he said, adding that he would try to recreate his floor-polishing business in Afghanistan. \u201cIf this works here, it is the best thing to do.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "El Salvador's President Nayib Bukele is intensifying his crackdown on dissent, a move observers suggest has been emboldened by his alliance with U.S. President Donald Trump",
      "SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador -- Days before his arrest outside his daughter\u2019s house in the outskirts of San Salvador, constitutional lawyer Enrique Anaya called Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele a \u201cdictator\u201d and a \u201cdespot\u201d on live TV.",
      "This week, lawyer Jaime Quintanilla stood outside a detention facility in El Salvador\u2019s capital with a box of food and clothes for his client, unsure if Anaya would ever be released.",
      "The Saturday arrest of Anaya, a fierce critic of Bukele, marks the latest move in what watchdogs describe as a wave of crackdown on dissent by the Central American leader. They say Bukele is emboldened by his alliance with U.S. President Donald Trump, who has not only praised him but avoided criticizing actions human rights defenders, international authorities and legal experts deem authoritarian.",
      "Authorities in El Salvador have targeted outspoken lawyers like Anaya, journalists investigating Bukele's alleged deals with gangs and human rights defenders calling for the end of a three-year state of emergency, which has suspended fundamental civil rights. Some say they have been forced to flee the country.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re trying to silence anyone who voices an opinion \u2014 professionals, ideologues, anyone who is critical \u2014 now they\u2019re jailed.\u201d Quintanilla said. \u201cIt\u2019s a vendetta.\u201d",
      "Bukele\u2019s office did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "Observers see a worrisome escalation by the popular president, who enjoys extremely high approval ratings due to his crackdown on the country's gangs. By suspending fundamental rights, Bukele has severely weakened gangs but also locked up 87,000 people for alleged gang ties, often with little evidence or due process. A number of those detained were also critics.",
      "Bukele and his New Ideas party have taken control of all three branches of government, stacking the country's Supreme Court with loyalists. Last year, in a move considered unconstitutional, he ran for reelection, securing a resounding victory.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t care if you call me a dictator,\" Bukele said earlier this month in a speech. \"Better that than seeing Salvadorans killed on the streets.\u201d",
      "In recent weeks, those who have long acted as a thorn in Bukele\u2019s side say looming threats have reached an inflection point. The crackdown comes as Bukele has garnered global attention for keeping some 200 Venezuelan deportees detained in a mega-prison built for gangs as part of an agreement with the Trump administration.",
      "Anaya was detained by authorities on unproven accusations of money laundering. Prosecutors said he would be sent to \u201crelevant courts\" in the coming days. Quintanilla, his lawyer, rejects the allegations, saying his arrest stems from years of vocally questioning Bukele.",
      "Quintanilla, a longtime colleague of Anaya, said he decided to represent his friend in part because many other lawyers in the country were now too afraid to show their faces. On Tuesday, the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights expressed \u201cdeep concern\u201d over Anaya\u2019s arrest.",
      "Anaya, 61, is a respected lawyer and commentator in El Salvador with a doctorate in constitutional law. He has criticized Bukele's crackdown on the gangs and Bukele stacking of El Salvador's high court. Last year, he was among those who unsuccessfully petitioned the country\u2019s top electoral authority to reject Bukele\u2019s re-election bid, saying it violated the constitution.",
      "Days before his arrest, Anaya railed on television against the detention of human rights lawyer Ruth L\u00f3pez, who last week shouted, \u201cThey\u2019re not going to silence me, I want a public trial,\u201d as police escorted her shackled to court.",
      "\u201cOf course I\u2019m scared,\u201d Anaya told the broadcast anchor. \u201cI think that anyone here who dares to speak out, speaks in fear.\u201d",
      "While some of Bukele\u2019s most vocal critics, like Anaya and L\u00f3pez, have been publicly detained, other human rights defenders have quietly slipped out of the country, hoping to seek asylum elsewhere in the region. They declined to comment or be identified out of fear that they would be targeted even outside El Salvador.",
      "Last month, a protest outside of Bukele\u2019s house was violently quashed by police and some of the protesters arrested. He also ordered the arrest of the heads of local bus companies for defying his order to offer free transport while a major highway was blocked.",
      "In late May, El Salvador\u2019s Congress passed a \u201cforeign agents\u201d law, championed by the populist president. It resembles legislation implemented by governments in Nicaragua, Venezuela, Russia, Belarus and China to silence and criminalize dissent by exerting pressure on organizations that rely on overseas funding.",
      "Ver\u00f3nica Reyna, a human rights coordinator for the Salvadoran nonprofit Servicio Social Pasionista, said police cars now regularly wait outside her group\u2019s offices as a lingering threat.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s been little-by-little,\u201d Reyna said. \u201cSince Trump came to power, we\u2019ve seen (Bukele) feel like there\u2019s no government that\u2019s going to strongly criticize him or try to stop him.\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s influence extends beyond his vocal backing of Bukele, with his administration pushing legal boundaries to push his agenda, Reyna, other human rights defenders and journalists said.",
      "The U.S. Embassy in El Salvador, which once regularly denounced the government's actions, has remained silent throughout the arrests and lingering threats. It did not respond to a request for comment. In its final year, the Biden administration, too, dialed back its criticism of the Bukele government as El Salvador's government helped slow migration north in the lead up to the 2024 election.",
      "On Tuesday, Quintanilla visited Anaya in detention for the first time since his arrest while being watched by police officers.",
      "Despite the detention, neither Anaya nor Quintanilla have been officially informed of the charges. Quintanilla worries that authorities will use wide ranging powers granted to Bukele by the \u201cstate of emergency\u201d to keep him imprisoned indefinitely.",
      "\u00d3scar Mart\u00ednez, editor-in-chief of news site El Faro, and four other journalists have left the country and are unable to return safely, as they face the prospect of arrest stemming from their reporting.",
      "At a time when many other reporters have fallen silent out of fear, Mart\u00ednez's news site has investigated Bukele more rigorously than perhaps any other, exposing hidden corruption and human rights abuses under his crackdown on gangs.",
      "In May, El Faro published a three-part interview with a former gang leader who claimed he negotiated with Bukele's administration. Soon after, Mart\u00ednez said the organization received news that authorities were preparing an arrest order for a half-dozen of their journalists. This has kept at least five El Faro journalists, including Mart\u00ednez, stranded outside their country for over a month.",
      "On Saturday, when the reporters tried to return home on a flight, a diplomatic source and a government official informed them that police had been sent to the airport to wait for them and likely arrest them.",
      "The journalists later discovered that their names, along with other civil society leaders, appeared on a list of \u201cpriority objectives\" held by airport authorities. Mart\u00ednez said Anaya's name was also on the list.",
      "Now in a nearby Central American nation, Mart\u00ednez said he doesn't know when he will be able to board another flight home. And if he does, he doesn't know what will happen when he steps off.",
      "\u201cWe fear that, if we return \u2014 because some of us surely will try \u2014 we'll be imprisoned,\u201d he said. \u201cI am positive that if El Faro journalists are thrown in prison, we'll be tortured and, possibly, even killed.\"",

      "BOGOTA, Colombia -- Colombian President Gustavo Petro on Wednesday bypassed legislative opposition and signed a decree summoning voters to the polls in August to decide changes to the country\u2019s labor laws, including whether workdays should be limited to eight hours.",
      "The decree fulfilled Petro\u2019s threat to Congress to put his labor system overhaul before voters should senators not approve the 12-question referendum themselves. He issued the measure in a tense political climate following the Saturday shooting of opposition senator and presidential candidate Miguel Uribe Turbay during a public event.",
      "The referendum has become the crux of long-running tensions between the executive and legislative branches.",
      "After Congress rejected Petro\u2019s labor reform twice, most recently in March, he sent lawmakers a 12-question referendum proposal on May 1 as Colombian law requires that the Senate rule on the advisability of referendums. The legislative body two weeks later voted 49-47 against the measure, prompting Petro to accuse lawmakers of fraud.",
      "Petro, Colombia\u2019s first leftist president, has accused Congress of working against the interest of workers and has asked them to demonstrate across the country.",
      "The referendum\u2019s questions include whether workers should receive double pay if they work during holidays; whether daytime workdays should end at 6 p.m.; and whether open-ended contracts should be offered to workers to prioritize job stability.",
      "The disagreements between Petro and Congress date back to the start of his term in 2022, but they have heightened as he seeks to consolidate his legacy ahead of next year\u2019s legislative and presidential elections.",
      "Uribe remained in critical condition Wednesday following his shooting in broad daylight Saturday during a political rally in the capital, Bogota. Authorities investigating the motive have not ruled out the possibility that it was a targeted attack on the opposition. They are also considering whether it was an attempt to destabilize the current government, or retaliation by illegal armed groups.",
      "In anticipation of court challenges, Petro on Wednesday said his government will send the decree to Colombia\u2019s Constitutional Court for review. At the same time, the Council of State is considering a lawsuit seeking to annul the Senate\u2019s vote.",

      "BERLIN -- BERLIN (AP) \u2014 Veteran rock star Bruce Springsteen, a high-profile critic of President Donald Trump, slammed the U.S. administration as \u201ccorrupt, incompetent and treasonous\u201d during a concert Wednesday in Berlin.",
      "He was addressing tens of thousands of fans at a stadium built for the 1936 Olympic Games that still bears the scars of World War II and contains relics from the country\u2019s dark Nazi past.",
      "\u201cTonight, we ask all who believe in democracy and the best of our American experiment to rise with us, raise your voices, stand with us against authoritarianism, and let freedom reign,\u201d he said.",
      "Springsteen has made increasingly pointed and contentious public statements in recent concerts. He peppered Wednesday's performance with mentions of the American democracy's system of checks and balances designed to ward against authoritarianism.",
      "His short speeches \u2014 referencing recent headlines about immigration raids, the freezing of federal funds for universities and measles outbreaks \u2014 came between songs that were also captioned in German on large screens beside the stage. The set was flanked by an American flag on one side and a German flag on the other.",
      "Still, the Boss remained hopeful: \u201cThe America that I've sung to you about for the past 50 years of my life is real. And regardless of its many faults, it's a great country with great people. And we will survive this moment.\u201d",
      "But last month in Manchester, he denounced Trump's politics during a concert, calling him an \u201cunfit president\u201d leading a \u201crogue government\u201d of people who have \u201cno concern or idea for what it means to be deeply American.\u201d",
      "Springsteen is no stranger to Berlin. In July 1988, he became one of the first Western musicians to perform in East Germany, performing to a roaring crowd of 160,000 East Germans yearning for American rock \u2019n\u2019 roll and the freedom it represented to the youth living under the crumbling communist regime.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not here for or against any government. I\u2019ve come to play rock \u2019n\u2019 roll for you in the hope that one day all the barriers will be torn down,\u201d Springsteen said in German at the time, before launching into a cover of Bob Dylan\u2019s \u201cChimes of Freedom.\u201d",
      "An Associated Press news story from that period says \u201cfireworks streaked through the sky\u201d and hundreds of people in the audience waved handmade American flags as they sang along to \u201cBorn in the USA.\u201d",
      "The Berlin Wall fell the following year, and some experts credit the concert for its part in fueling the protest movement that brought the end of the Communist government.",
      "Almost four decades later, Springsteen issued a stark warning: \u201cThe America that I love, the America that I\u2019ve sung to you about, that has been a beacon of hope and liberty for 250 years, is currently in the hands of a corrupt, incompetent, and treasonous administration.\"",

      "ANKARA, Turkey -- A Turkish far-right politician accused of inciting public hatred and hostility went on trial Wednesday in a case critics view as an effort to suppress opposition to the president.",
      "Umit Ozdag, the leader of Turkey's Victory Party, was detained in January over accusations he insulted President Recep Tayyip Erdogan with comments he made during a party meeting in Antalya.",
      "A day later Ozdag was formally arrested and charged with inciting hatred against migrants. He was blamed for last year's anti-Syrian refugee riots in the central Turkish province of Kayseri last year, during which hundreds of homes and businesses were attacked.",
      "Prosecutors have presented a series of posts from Ozdag's social media as evidence against him. He faces up to four years in prison if found guilty.",
      "Ozdag, a 64-year-old former academic, is an outspoken critic of Turkey\u2019s refugee policies and has previously called for the repatriation of millions of Syrian refugees.",
      "Ozdag acknowledged advocating the return of refugees at the opening hearing of his trial at a prison complex on the outskirts of Istanbul. He denied he had incited for violence against them and told the court he had worked to calm tensions in Kayseri.",
      "In his defense statement, Ozdag maintained that his imprisonment was politically motivated and aimed at silencing him over his criticism of the government's recent effort to end a decades-long conflict with the militant Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party, or PKK.",
      "\u201cThe reason why I am here ... is because I criticized the talks held with the PKK terrorist organization\u2019s chief,\u201d Ozdag said.",
      "The Victory Party strongly opposes any concessions to the PKK which Turkey, along with many Western states including the United States, Britain and the European Union, considers a terrorist organization. The conflict with the PKK has resulted in tens of thousands of deaths since the 1980s.",
      "When the trial opened Wednesday, Ozdag's lawyers requested more time to prepare, and the proceedings were adjourned until Tuesday.",
      "The politician's trial comes amid a widespread crackdown on the opposition to Erdogan's Justice and Development Party.",
      "Officials from municipalities controlled by the main opposition \u2014 the Republican People\u2019s Party, or CHP \u2014 have faced waves of arrests this year. Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu was detained in March over allegations of corruption.",
      "Many people in Turkey consider the cases to be politically driven, according to opinion polls. However, Erdogan\u2019s government insists the courts are impartial and free from political involvement.",
      "Imamoglu is widely viewed as the main challenger to Erdogan\u2019s two-decade rule and is the CHP\u2019s candidate for the next presidential election. The election is due in 2028 but could be held earlier.",

      "A week ago, there were 248,000 jobless claim applications, which was the most since early October and a sign that layoffs could be trending higher.",
      "Weekly applications for jobless benefits are considered representative of U.S. layoffs and have mostly bounced around a historically healthy range between 200,000 and 250,000 since COVID-19 throttled the economy five years ago, wiping out millions of jobs.",

In another sign the job market has cooled from the hiring boom of 2021-2023, the government reported one job for every unemployed person. As recently as December 2022, there were two vacancies for every jobless American.",
      "The government has estimated that the U.S. economy shrank at a 0.2% annual pace in the first quarter of 2025, a slight upgrade from its first estimate. Growth was slowed by a surge in imports as companies in the U.S. tried to bring in foreign goods before Trump\u2019s massive tariffs went into effect.",

      "NEW YORK -- The first thing Alison Jones does when she wakes up is to name three things she\u2019s grateful for. It can be as simple as the breeze from a fan or as meaningful as the way a friend showed up for her emotionally.",
      "Jones, an organizational development consultant, said the daily practice has helped her through hardships and the anxiety and vulnerability of starting her own business as a single mom.",
      "\u201cWhen you practice gratitude, you train your brain to always look for the positive in anything. It just completely shifts everything you\u2019re going through,\u201d she said. \u201cYou start to see the lessons in the pain. You start see the beauty in the very difficult times because you realize, \u2018Hey, I\u2019m growing stronger.\u2019\u201d",
      "Practicing and encouraging gratitude can be a simple way to boost morale at a time when layoffs and economic uncertainty are causing stress and anxiety. Some employers have found that workers who receive expressions of gratitude show more engagement and willingness to help others.",
      "Other proponents say expressing and receiving appreciation can help reduce stress, as well as improve a person's mood and outlook.",
      "But despite its benefits, promoting gratefulness is often overlooked as a valuable way to spend time and resources in the workplace.",
      "Experts in organizational change shared ways to incorporate more gratitude into the workday.",
      "If you\u2019re new to practicing gratitude, you can start at home with a routine such as Jones\u2019 custom of expressing gratitude before getting out of bed.",
      "She made her gratitude practice easy so it would become a sustainable habit. Her one rule is avoiding repetition and stretching her mind to find new things to be grateful for each day.",
      "Jones also recommends finding a \u201cgratitude buddy\u201d to share with. A buddy may be a friend from work or your social circles, and ideas can be exchanged in person, by text or email, or during a phone call. Many people find it helpful to list what they\u2019re grateful for in a journal.",
      "At work, a team leader can begin a staff meeting by expressing gratitude for what went well in the last week, suggested Peter Bonanno, a consultant who helps companies design mindfulness-based programs.",
      "As humans, we often have a bias toward negativity, but gratitude \u201cjust does an enormous amount to shift people\u2019s mindsets and the way they engage with each other,\u201d he said. \u201cGratitude is especially powerful in that way. It doesn\u2019t take a long time for people to notice an impact.\u201d",
      "O.C. Tanner Institute, a software and service company, helps organizations find effective ways to show appreciation to their employees, such as managers giving handwritten notes of thanks. The company helped American Airlines develop a system for managers and colleagues to recognize good work with points that can be applied to a catalog order.",
      "It also helped Amway create gift boxes to celebrate workers' accomplishments and important personal milestones, such as buying a home or adopting a child.",
      "\u201cRecognition impacts so many facets of the employee experience. And when you do it well, it connects people back to a deep sense of purpose and meaning,\u201d said Meghan Stettler, a director at O.C. Tanner.",
      "Some companies donate their own products to thank nurses, doctors, police officers, firefighters and other workers who serve their communities. Frontline Builders, a nonprofit organization launched during the pandemic, connects donors of snacks, drinks and personal care items with recipients.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve all worked in that job where we weren\u2019t shown gratitude and realized how much that stinks,\u201d said Jason Lalack, partnership director at Frontline Builders. \u201cShowing someone gratitude or showing appreciation doesn\u2019t really cost anything, and shouldn\u2019t be that difficult of a thing, and yet it\u2019s rarer than it should be.\u201d",
      "Registered nurse Denise Whittsell remembers how quiet the hospital where she works became during the pandemic. The hallways of Denver Health, typically busy with families and guests, were suddenly empty as visits from outsiders were curtailed and patients battled illnesses alone.",
      "Once in a while, someone from the community would deliver gifts of gratitude: tasty snacks or handmade cards from schoolchildren.",
      "\u201cThose spontaneous recognitions were really sweet,\u201d Whittsell said. \u201cIt just felt really kind, and it felt like there was a lot of wrapping around us, a very supportive feeling.\u201d",
      "Whittsell is part of a team of volunteers at Denver Health's RESTORE program, which connects front-line hospital workers with trained peer responders for confidential emotional support and training.",
      "The hospital started the program as a way to improve and sustain the emotional well-being of its workforce, said Tia Henry, the program's director. Volunteers take shifts so someone is available around-the-clock to answer calls from hospital personnel who are struggling with stressful events such as losing a patient or witnessing violence.",
      "Volunteers and staff regularly express gratitude for the program, Henry said.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve had calls on my way to work: \u2018I\u2019m having a hard time and I need to talk with somebody who gets it,\u2019\u201d Whittsell said. \u201cIt\u2019s a good way to give back to the people that I work with.\"",
      "Aside from peer support, RESTORE also provides training and education to employees about stress, burnout and techniques to deescalate violence, Henry said.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re not doing counseling or therapy, but we\u2019re using components of psychological first aid to truly engage timely with our teammates when they\u2019re distressed, helping them calm their nervous system and get back to the place of regulation where they can show back up and do what it is they need to do or they can lay something down and go back home,\u201d Henry said. \u201cThat is gratitude from my lens.\u201d",
      "Indy Public Safety Foundation, an Indianapolis nonprofit organization that supports front-line workers, shows gratitude to police, firefighters and paramedics through awards banquets, trainings, and showing up with food, shaking hands and saying thank you after a community tragedy.",

      "While front-line workers were applauded during the pandemic, \"their work has continued and arguably not gotten any less stressful, and some of that support has waned,\u201d said Dane Nutty, the foundation's president and CEO.",
      "While practicing gratitude may make for a more pleasant on-the-job environment, it's not a replacement for better working conditions. It's good to be grateful to have a job that pays the bills. It's also important to ask for what's fair.",
      "\u201cBeing grateful absolutely doesn\u2019t mean that we accept anything subpar or inappropriate,\u201d Jones said, adding that people should advocate for basic needs such as meal breaks. \u201cIt\u2019s important not to confuse gratitude with being passive.\"",

      "NEW YORK -- Toy robots that teach children to code. Sneakers made in America. Mold-resistant kitchen gadgets.",
      "The three items are among new products that have gotten stuck in the pipeline due to President Donald Trump's unpredictable trade policies, according to the brand founders behind the stalled items. They say that instead of fostering U.S. innovation, Trump\u2019s tariffs are stifling it with extra costs and unexpected work.",
      "At Learning Resources in Vernon Hills, Illinois, Made Plus in Annapolis, Maryland, and Dorai Home in Salt Lake City, research and development have taken a backseat to recalculating budgets, negotiating with vendors and tracking shipments in the shifting tariff environment.",
      "\u201cIf we don\u2019t have enough cash to cover just the restocks of the things that we know we need, do we want to take a risk on this new thing when we don\u2019t know how well it will sell yet?\u201d Dorai Home founder Kelsey O\u2019Callaghan said.",
      "O\u2019Callaghan started the eco-friendly home goods company with a stone bath mat and now offers about 50 kitchen and bathroom accessories, which are made in China with a non-toxic material that dries quickly. New launches are critical to increasing sales and attracting customers, she said.",
      "As Trump increased the tariff on Chinese goods to 20% and as high as 145% before reducing the import tax rate to 30% for 90 days, Dorai Home postponed introducing new merchandise. O'Callaghan said she had to lay off the CEO as well as the head of product development, who helped the company jump on new trends.",
      "\u201cI haven\u2019t really put the time or the emphasis on (innovation) because I\u2019m covering too many other people\u2019s roles,\u201d she said.",
      "The company paused shipments from China in early April but resumed some on a staggered basis after the president's rate reduction. On Wednesday, Trump touted progress  in U.S.-China trade talks.",
      "With details still sketchy and a deal not finalized, entrepreneurs interviewed by The Associated Press said they viewed the tariffs war as an ongoing threat.",
      "The potential stunting of innovation follows an economic slowdown during the coronavirus pandemic, when companies also had to put projects on hold. Some experts think the on-again-off again tariffs may have more enduring consequences because they rewire markets and upend business strategies.",
      "\u201cWhen executive attention shifts from innovation to regulatory compliance, the innovation pipeline suffers. Companies end up optimizing for the political landscape rather than technological advancement,\u201d economists J. Bradford Jensen, a nonresident senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, and Scott J. Wallsten, president of the Technology Policy Institute think tank, wrote in an April blog post.",
      "Trump has argued that curtailing foreign imports with tariffs would help revive the nation's diminished manufacturing base. Analysts and various trade groups have warned that fractured trade ties and supply chains may depress R&D activity of U.S. tech and health care companies that rely on international partnerships or foreign suppliers.",
      "Small companies, which often drive the innovations that create jobs and economic growth, already are under strain.",
      "With fewer people on staff and tighter budgets compared to large corporations, entrepreneurs say they are spending more time on cutting costs, suspending or arranging orders, and deciding how much of their tariff-related costs to charge customers. That means they\u2019re spending less time thinking of their next big ideas.",
      "Schylling Inc., a Massachusetts company that produces modern versions of Lava lamps, Sea-Monkeys, My Little Pony and other nostalgic toys, has its products made in China. As part of its strategy to account for tariffs, the company put a group of employees on temporary unpaid leave last month to reduce expenses.",
      "Marketing director Beth Muehlenkamp said she and other furloughed workers typically would have been planning products for the final months of 2026. But Schylling isn't focusing on designing new products given the unstable trade outlook.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s really hard to focus on innovation and creativity when you\u2019re consumed with this day-to-day of how we\u2019re just going to balance the books and deal with the changing rates,\u201d Muehlenkamp said.",
      "Even some companies that do their manufacturing in the U.S. are scaling back investments in new products. Made Plus, a Maryland company that makes athletic shoes at a small factory in the state capital, put a planned golf line on hold because two key components \u2014 a foam insole and the tread for the bottom of the shoe \u2014 currently are made in China, founder Alan Guyan said.",
      "The company customizes its shoes on demand and charges $145 to $200 a pair. The footwear is made from recycled plastic bottles with advanced knitting, 3D printing and computerized stitching techniques. It's looking into getting components from Vietnam instead of China.",
      "Embracing new technology is essential to restoring manufacturing capability in the U.S. and competing with Asia, Guyan said. But given ongoing trade frictions, he said he does not want to invest time or money evaluating the latest embroidery and knitting machines, which come from Germany, Italy, China and the U.S.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re just battening down the hatches a little bit and just hoping that there\u2019s enough influence in the community of footwear that it will somewhat change and get resolved and we can move forward,\u201d he said of the tariff roller coaster.",
      "In contrast, many big companies are forging on. Google parent Alphabet confirmed late last month that it still planned to spend $75 billion on capital expenditures this year, with most of the money going toward artificial intelligence technology.",
      "Sonia Lapinsky, a managing director at consulting firm AlixPartners, has advised her clients to limit tariff discussions to a small group of executives and to keep their product creation cycles in motion.",
      "Businesses have an even greater imperative to come up with attention-grabbing innovations when consumers may be reluctant to open their wallets, she said.",
      "Yet smaller companies may struggle to wall off tariff discussions from the rest of the business.",
      "Learning Resources CEO Rick Woldenberg said that roughly 25% to 30% of the 350 employees at the educational toy company\u2019s headquarters, including product developers, are working at least part-time on tariff-related tasks.",
      "The company usually develops 250 different products a year and expects to get half that many off the drawing board for 2026, Woldenberg said. While exploring factories in countries besides China, he said, Learning Resources is delaying the next generation of its interactive robots that help children develop computer programming skills through games and other activities.",

    "story": [
      "U.S. President Donald Trump wants China to lift restrictions on exporting rare earths and other critical minerals that Beijing imposed as part of a yearslong trade war",
      "GANZHOU, China -- China\u2019s dominance over critical minerals in global supply chains was a powerful bargaining chip in trade talks between Beijing and Washington that concluded with both sides saying they have a framework to pursue a deal.",
      "China has spent decades building the world's main industrial chain for mining and processing such materials, which are used in many industries such as electronics, advanced manufacturing, defense and health care.",
      "Mines and factories in and around Ganzhou, a key production hub for rare earths, underpin China's control over the minerals. Many residents grew up collecting rocks containing the valuable minerals from the forested hills surrounding the southern city and today make a living from mining, trading or processing them.",
      "Responding to ever higher tariffs and other controls on advanced technology, China told exporters of certain key rare earths and other critical minerals to obtain licenses for every shipment abroad. Approvals can take weeks, leading to supply chain disruptions in the U.S. and other countries.",
      "President Donald Trump said Wednesday that China would make it easier for American industry to obtain much-needed needed magnets and rare earth minerals, clearing the way for talks to continue between the world\u2019s two biggest economies. In return, Trump said, the U.S. will stop efforts to revoke the visas of Chinese nationals on U.S. college campuses.",
      "But details remain scarce. Beijing has not confirmed what the negotiators agreed to, and Chinese President Xi Jinping and Trump himself have yet to sign off on it.",
      "The Chinese Commerce Ministry said Saturday it had approved a \u201ccertain number\u201d of export licenses for rare earth products, apparently acknowledging Trump\u2019s personal request to Xi during a phone call last week. And on Wednesday, the Ganzhou-based rare-earth conglomerate JL MAG Rare-Earth Co. confirmed it had obtained some export licenses for shipments to destinations including the U.S., Europe and Southeast Asia.",
      "Experts say, however, Beijing is unlikely to do away with the permit system enabling it to control access to those valuable resources.",
      "The only scenario in which China might deregulate its critical minerals export is if the U.S. first fully removes tariffs imposed on Chinese goods as part of the trade war, said Wang Yiwei, a professor of international affairs at Renmin University, echoing the Chinese government\u2019s earlier stance.",
      "\u201cWithout that,\u201d he said, \u201cit will be difficult to blame China for continuing to strengthen its export controls.\u201d",
      "In 1992, Deng Xiaoping, the leader who launched China's ascent as the world's biggest manufacturing power, famously said \u201cthe Middle East has oil, China has rare earths,\u201d signaling a desire to leverage access to the key minerals.",
      "Several generations later, Beijing has made its rich reserves of rare earths, a group of 17 minerals that are abundant in the earth\u2019s crust but hard, expensive and environmentally polluting to process, a key element of China's economic security. In 2019, during a visit to a rare earth processing plant in Ganzhou, Xi described rare earths as a \u201cvital strategic resource.\u201d",
      "China today has an essential monopoly over \u201cheavy rare earths,\u201d used for making powerful, heat-resistance magnets used in industries such as defense and electric vehicles.",
      "The country also produces around 80% of the world\u2019s tungsten, gallium and antimony, and 60% of the world\u2019s germanium -\u2013 all minerals used in the making of semiconductors, among other advanced technologies.",
      "The risks of dependency on Chinese suppliers first came into focus in 2010, when Beijing suspended rare earths exports to Japan due to a territorial dispute. The ban was lifted after about two months, but as a precaution, Japan invested in rare earths processing plants in other countries and began stockpiling the materials.",
      "Beijing's across-the-board requirement for export licenses for some critical minerals has put pressure on world electronics manufacturers and automakers.",
      "Some auto parts makers in Europe have shut down production lines due to delays in supply deliveries, according to the European Association of Automotive Suppliers. In the U.S., Tesla CEO Elon Musk said a shortage of rare earths is affecting his company\u2019s work on humanoid robots.",
      "In the drab industrial hub of Ganzhou, cradled by the scenic Dayu Mountains, the U.S.-China trade war is still a distant stressor. Miners and small mineral traders interviewed by The Associated Press said they are more concerned about depleting the mountains' once-abundant resources.",
      "Zhong, a tungsten factory manager in Ganzhou who would only give his last name, worked his way up to manager from a miner, but he's unsure there is a future for him and others in the industry.",
      "\u201cI find growing difficulties to source tungsten these days,\u201d he said, adding that smaller mines and trading companies are slowly disappearing as the resources are dwindling. Tungsten is an ultra-hard metal used in armor-piercing ammunition, nuclear reactors and semiconductors.",
      "At least five tungsten mines have closed in the area in recent years, according to state media. Remaining reserves are deeper and harder to extract and process after decades of exploitation, said Li Shangkui, chairman of the Ganzhou-based Jiangxi Yuean Advanced Materials Co., Ltd.",
      "Processing factories in Ganzhou now routinely source materials from other provinces or other countries. Zhong\u2019s plant imports some raw materials from places like Africa and Cambodia.",
      "Major state-owned and private companies in Ganzhou are also ramping up investments abroad. Tungsten producer Ganzhou Haisheng, for instance, announced last year a $25 million investment in a new tungsten plant in Thailand.",
      "Whatever the challenges in procuring raw materials, China likely will seek to maintain its dominance in critical minerals, said Fabian Villalobos, an engineer and critical minerals expert at the RAND think tank.",
      "Between 2020 and 2023, the U.S. imported at least 70% of the rare earth compounds it used from China, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. It has diversified its sources in recent years, but still mainly relies on China.",
      "Since beginning his second term in office, Trump has made improving access to critical minerals a matter of national security. But the U.S. has an incredibly long way to go to catch up with China, experts say.",
      "The sole operational U.S. rare earths mine, in Mountain Pass, California, is unable to separate heavy rare earths. It sends its ore to China for processing. The U.S. Defense Department has provided funding to the mine's owner, MP Materials, to build new separation facilities. It will take months to build and still only produce a fraction of what is needed.",
      "Friction over the issue has opened the way for government-backed financing that was unavailable before, said Mark Smith, who ran the Mountain Pass mine in the early 2010s and now leads NioCorp. It's seeking about $780 million in financing through the U.S. Export-Import Bank to build a processing facility in Nebraska for critical minerals including rare earths.",
      "The Defense Department has committed $439 million to building domestic rare earth supply chains, but building a complete mining and processing industrial chain like China's could take decades.",
      "\u201cThere are going to be some real issues here unless we can figure out how to get along with China for a period of time while we're developing our own resources and our mainstream processing,\u201d Smith said.",
      "The spotlight on critical minerals also provides opportunities for smaller miners to invest in extracting and processing some critical minerals, such as tungsten, considered \u201cniche\u201d because they are needed in relatively small amounts in key industries, said Milo McBride, an expert on sustainability and geopolitics at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.",
      "\u201cFor many of these companies, the business strategy hedges on a scenario where the U.S. and China become more confrontational and where trade relations become more uncomfortable,\u201d McBride said. \u201cAnd all of a sudden, what was once an uneconomic project somewhere outside of China starts to make more sense.\u201d",

      "The owner of an Omaha food packaging company says his business has been unfairly hamstrung by Tuesday's raid carried out by federal immigration officials",
      "OMAHA, Neb. -- The owner of an Omaha food packaging company says his business has been unfairly hamstrung by federal immigration officials, who raided the plant and arrested more than half its workforce.",
      "The raid took place despite the company meticulously following the government's own system for verifying the workers were in the country legally, owner Gary Rohwer said Wednesday.",
      "Glenn Valley Foods now is operating at about 30% of capacity as the business scrambles to hire more workers, Rohwer said as he stood outside the plant.",
      "Asked how upsetting the raid was, Rohwer replied, \u201cI was very upset, ma\u2019am, because we were told to e-verify, and we e-verified all these years, so I was shocked.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe did everything we could possibly do,\" he said.",
      "E-Verify is an online U.S. Department of Homeland Security system launched in the late 1990s that allows employers to quickly check if potential employees can work legally in the U.S., often by using Social Security numbers.",
      "Some of America\u2019s largest employers use it, including Starbucks and Walmart, but the vast majority of employers do not. Critics say the system is fairly easy to cheat, particularly with false documents.",
      "Rohwer noted that federal officials have said his company was a victim of those using stolen identities or fake IDs to get around the E-Verify system, which lead agents conducting the raid described as \u201cbroken\u201d and \u201cflawed\u201d to Glenn Valley executives.",
      "But that does nothing to repair the company\u2019s bottom line, Rohwer said.",
      "\u201cI\u2019d like to see the United States government ... come up with a program that they can communicate to the companies as to how to hire legitimate help. Period,\u201d he said.",
      "U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement confirmed that more than 70 people were arrested during the Glenn Valley Foods raid on Tuesday. It also said one of the workers, described as a Honduras national, assaulted federal agents as he was being detained.",
      "The Omaha raid comes amid an immigration crackdown under President Donald Trump. The administration has been intensifying its efforts in recent weeks, and Trump deployed more than 4,000 National Guard troops and 700 Marines this week to respond to ongoing protests in Los Angeles over his immigration policies.",
      "The raid, in the southeastern section of Omaha where nearly a quarter of residents are foreign born according to the 2020 census, led to hundreds of people turning out to protest Tuesday evening. But it also had a chilling effect on the south Omaha community.",
      "The Metropolitan Community College\u2019s South Omaha campus and an Omaha library branch in the area closed Tuesday afternoon, and several businesses along south Omaha's normally bustling 24th Street closed as news of the raid spread. Several of them remained closed Wednesday, said Douglas County Board of Commissioners Chairman Roger Garcia, whose district covers south Omaha.",
      "\u201cEverybody\u2019s still on alert, waiting to see what happens today and in the coming days,\u201d Garcia said. \u201cSo there\u2019s still a lot of anxiety and fear out there.\u201d",
      "That fear will show up in the form of a weakened economy in Omaha, he added.",
      "\u201cYou know, when products are not being sold, taxes are not being collected, and people are not able to get their goods as well. So it affects all of us,\u201d he said.",
      "An aunt of Garcia's wife was among those taken away by ICE during the Omaha raid, he said. They have been unable to determine where she is being held.",
      "The raid came on the same day of the inauguration of newly elected Omaha Mayor John Ewing, a Democrat who unseated three-term Republican Jean Stothert last month.",
      "During a news conference Wednesday to address the raid, Ewing declined to speculate on whether the timing of it was intended to distract from his swearing-in. But he denounced the action by federal authorities, saying, \u201cMy message to the public is that we are with them.\u201d",
      "Omaha Police Chief Todd Schmaderer also declared that his department will play no part in checking immigration or the legal status of residents in the community.",
      "\u201cThat is not our mission. Our mission is public safety,\u201d the chief said. \u201cI need victims to come forward. They will not come forward if they\u2019re fearful of Omaha Police Department being immigration officers.\u201d",

      "President Donald Trump is expected to sign a measure Thursday that blocks California\u2019s first-in-the-nation rule banning the sale of new gas-powered cars by 2035",
      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump is expected to sign a measure Thursday that blocks California\u2019s first-in-the-nation rule banning the sale of new gas-powered cars by 2035, a White House official told The Associated Press.",
      "The resolution Trump plans to sign, which Congress approved last month, aims to quash the country\u2019s most aggressive attempt to phase out gas-powered cars. He also plans to approve measures to overturn state policies curbing tailpipe emissions in certain vehicles and smog-forming nitrogen oxide pollution from trucks.",
      "The timing of the signing was confirmed Wednesday by a White House official who spoke on condition of anonymity to share plans not yet public.",
      "The development comes as the Republican president is mired in a clash with California's Democratic governor, Gavin Newsom, over Trump's move to deploy troops to Los Angeles in response to immigration protests. It's the latest in an ongoing battle between the Trump administration and heavily Democratic California over everything from tariffs to the rights of LGBTQ+ youth and funding for electric vehicle chargers.",
      "\u201cIf it\u2019s a day ending in Y, it\u2019s another day of Trump\u2019s war on California,\u201d Newsom spokesperson Daniel Villase\u00f1or said in an email. \"We\u2019re fighting back.\"",
      "According to the White House official, Trump is expected to sign resolutions that block California\u2019s rule phasing out gas-powered cars and ending the sale of new ones by 2035. He will also kill rules that phase out the sale of medium- and heavy-duty diesel vehicles and cut tailpipe emissions from trucks.",
      "The president is scheduled to sign the measures and make remarks during an event at the White House on Thursday morning.",
      "Newsom, who is considered a likely 2028 Democratic presidential candidate, and California officials contend that what the federal government is doing is illegal and said the state plans to sue.",
      "Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy, Energy Secretary Chris Wright and Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin are expected to attend, along with members of Congress and representatives from the energy, trucking and gas station industries.",
      "The signings come as Trump has pledged to revive American auto manufacturing and boost oil and gas drilling.",
      "The move will also come a day after the Environmental Protection Agency proposed repealing rules that limit greenhouse gas emissions from power plants fueled by coal and natural gas. Zeldin said it would remove billions of dollars in costs for industry and help \u201cunleash\u201d American energy.",
      "California, which has some of the nation\u2019s worst air pollution, has been able to seek waivers for decades from the EPA, allowing it to adopt stricter emissions standards than the federal government.",
      "In his first term, Trump revoked California\u2019s ability to enforce its standards, but President Joe Biden reinstated it in 2022. Trump has not yet sought to revoke it again.",
      "Republicans have long criticized those waivers and earlier this year opted to use the Congressional Review Act, a law aimed at improving congressional oversight of actions by federal agencies, to try to block the rules.",
      "That\u2019s despite a finding from the U.S. Government Accountability Office, a nonpartisan congressional watchdog, that California\u2019s standards cannot legally be blocked using the Congressional Review Act. The Senate parliamentarian agreed with that finding.",
      "California, which makes up roughly 11% of the U.S. car market, has significant power to sway trends in the auto industry. About a dozen states signed on to adopt California's rule phasing out the sale of new gas-powered cars.",
      "The National Automobile Dealers Association supported the federal government\u2019s move to block California\u2019s ban on gas-powered cars, saying Congress should decide on such a national issue, not the state.",

    "story": [
      "\u201cTake Me out to the Ball Game\u201d is more than just a song sung every summer in baseball stadiums around the United States",
      "NEW YORK -- It's sung every summer in baseball stadiums around the United States. But the impact of \u201cTake Me Out to the Ball Game\u201d goes much further than simply getting fans out of their seats for the 7th-inning stretch.",
      "More than a century after Jack Norworth penned the lyrics, a nonprofit founded with the song's royalties is celebrating 50 years of supporting young musicians \u2014 including the talent behind some of today's most popular musicals. The ASCAP Foundation, the charitable arm for the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers, was established in 1975 after Norworth's estate left a bequest of the licensing payments for baseball's unofficial anthem and his other hits.",
      "\u201cJust as all music begins with a song, the ASCAP Foundation began with a song,\u201d said Paul Williams, the group's president and a composer-lyricist whose award-winning career includes \u201cRainbow Connection.\u201d",
      "The organization provides money, lessons and mentorship at all career stages in an industry where that support is badly needed by artists who often toil for years working other gigs while trying to get their music before the right ears. To reach its semicentennial, however, the foundation has had to identify new funding streams and reinvent programming.",
      "\u201cTake Me Out to the Ballgame,\u201d written in 1908, has since entered the public domain and no longer generates revenue. The foundation nowadays relies on a mix of philanthropies, corporate sponsors and general public donations. The Louis Armstrong Educational Foundation is a longtime backer and storied New York law firm Paul Weiss is another sponsor.",
      "And, according to Williams, \u201cthere\u2019s not a lot of stingy songwriters out there.\u201d The late Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller, as well as Herb Alpert, are among those with named scholarships and awards. Williams said other bequests, which are charitable gifts left through a will, have come from \u201cHello, Dolly!\u201d composer-lyricist Jerry Herman and \u201cTea for Two\u201d lyricist Irving Ceasar.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s really a way of making a mark on the world and extending their values forward,\u201d fundraising coach Claire Axelrad said of bequests, which she added have consistently made up about one-tenth of charitable gifts.",
      "With dwindling arts funding and millions of children reportedly going without music education, the ASCAP Foundation is also trying to reach underserved communities. Leaders count nearly 60,000 K-12 students who participated in last year's programs. They help teach guitar to New York summer campers and bring students to free Broadway-caliber productions. Youth are learning to play the djembe, a drum originally from West Africa, through a collaboration with urban farming nonprofit Harlem Grown.",
      "Tax filings show the foundation gave away more than $325,000 in grants for scholarships, fellowships and cash awards in 2023. Award-winning songwriter Emily Bear, who co-wrote the soundtrack for Disney\u2019s \u201cMoana 2,\u201d said the foundation took her \u201cvery seriously\" when she was a five-year-old prodigy receiving its young composer award.",
      "\u201cThat kind of validation at that kind of age means so much when you\u2019re just a little girl with very big dreams and you\u2019re in a room full of people that you idolize,\" she said.",
      "Composer Stephen Schwartz, who was honored this week with the ASCAP Foundation Champion Award during a June 10 fundraiser at Tony winner Adam Guettel\u2019s Manhattan home, said the nonprofit is filling gaps as the government \u201csupports the arts less and less.\u201d",
      "This April also marked the third year that Schwartz has hosted the foundation\u2019s two-day Musical Theatre Fest in Los Angeles. The location allows participants to get feedback from prominent guests and connect with Hollywood studios \u2014 one way the foundation is trying to stay relevant by serving the renewed interest in musicals for television and film screens.",
      "It's emblematic of the mentorship younger composers say Schwartz \u2014 a Broadway icon whose hits include \u201cGodspell,\u201d \u201cPippin\u201d and \u201cWicked\u201d \u2014 has offered to emerging artists over the years.",
      "Benj Pasek and Justin Paul, the songwriting duo behind \u201cDear Evan Hansen,\u201d credited the ASCAP Foundation for \u201ccementing\u201d their connection with Schwartz. Pasek said such close proximity to a hero, who then became a \"living, breathing person who gives you advice,\u201d made the profession \u201cmore plausible.\u201d",
      "\u201cTypically, you\u2019re working on projects on a wing and a prayer and hoping that someday it reaches the stage,\u201d Paul said. \"So, an organization like the ASCAP Foundation breathing life into not just your work, but your pocketbooks, is a huge, huge support.\u201d",
      "Schwartz said it was \u201cscary and bewildering\u201d when he first started out without any connections. He sees an important role for himself as someone who can \u201cease the way a bit\u201d to help newcomers\u2019 \u201ctalents flourish earlier and more completely.\u201d",
      "There\u2019s also another motivation.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s slightly selfish because I get to see good work and enjoy it,\u201d Schwartz added.",

      "President Donald Trump\u2019s pick to lead the Federal Aviation Administration is facing tough questions about safety in the wake of January\u2019s deadly midair collision and a string of other crashes and near misses since then",
      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump's pick to lead the Federal Aviation Administration is facing tough questions about safety during a hearing Wednesday in the wake of January's deadly midair collision and a string of other crashes and near misses since then.",
      "Much of the industry, including the major airlines and their trade groups, supports Bryan Bedford\u2019s nomination. But pilots unions and Democrats have raised concerns that he might weaken pilot training standards.",
      "Bedford has been CEO of regional airline Republic Airways since 1999 and has more than three decades of experience in the industry. He has pledged to make safety the FAA\u2019s top priority and work to restore public confidence in flying. Bedford also said he'll work with Congress on Trump\u2019s multi-billion-dollar plan to overhaul the nation\u2019s air traffic control system.",
      "The National Transportation Safety Board has said the FAA should have acted before the crash in Washington, D.C., because there had been 85 near misses reported around Ronald Reagan National Airport in the years before the disaster. The FAA has since banned some helicopter routes to make sure helicopters and planes no longer share the same airspace, but there have still been additional near misses in recent months.",
      "FAA's acting administrator and Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy have acknowledged the FAA's shortcomings in not recognizing the risk and pledged to review all the agency's data to identify any similar concerns nationwide about helicopter traffic near airports. That review prompted the agency to put new limits on helicopter flights around Las Vegas' airport.",
      "Even the air traffic controllers union backed Bedford's nomination because of his support for the effort to modernize the outdated system and bolster controller hiring. Two different radar outages this spring in a facility that directs planes in and out of Newark Liberty International Airport highlighted the problems because the FAA had to limit flights at the airport after five controllers took trauma leave after the problems.",
      "\u201cFlying is safe, but as you know the system that manages our skies is showing its age,\" Bedford said in his prepared statement to the committee. \u201cThe stresses of this antiquated system truly came into view as we all returned to the skies after COVID.\u201d",
      "Pilots\u2019 unions and Democrats have raised concerns that Bedford may support weakening the 1,500-hour experience standard for airline pilots that was adopted after a 2009 crash or even might consider allowing some airlines to operate with only one pilot. Republic previously asked for permission to hire pilots with less experience because the standard was making it hard to find enough pilots.",
      "\u201cPeople are going to want to know ... whether you\u2019re going to lead any effort to change that rule,\u201d Democratic Sen. Maria Cantwell said. She asked for a firm written answer because \u201cyou helped fund and lobbied for a change for it.\u201d",
      "Bedford acknowledged Wednesday that \u201cproblems persist and more work needs to be done\u201d to ensure the safety of flying around the nation's capital. He said his own airline's planes have received at least three alarms about conflicting traffic around Reagan since January.",

      "Hidden gems are excellent vehicles that have a lot to offer but are often overlooked by shoppers",
      "There are some new cars that many shoppers tend to overlook even though they have a lot to offer. These hidden gems boast a special combination of attractive qualities and can potentially make excellent choices for savvy folks who want their ride to stand out from the sea of mainstream vehicles. Certain slower-selling cars don\u2019t get the respect they deserve, whether due to styling, the type of vehicle, or brand image. Edmunds explores five hidden gems and the wow factor that makes them shine. Our choices are ordered by starting price, including destination fees.",
      "The Ioniq 6 is an electric sedan that does almost everything right. It\u2019s sporty and fun to drive, yet it\u2019s also comfortable and has a smooth ride over rough dips and potholes. Inside, you\u2019ll find a well-built interior that\u2019s easy to use. The Ioniq 6 touts a long EPA-estimated range of up to 342 miles. It\u2019s also one of the quickest-charging EVs on the market when using a powerful fast-charging machine.",
      "The electric Hyundai\u2019s drawbacks are mostly minor, with one big exception. Its styling isn\u2019t for everyone and attracts attention for good and bad reasons. However, the upcoming 2026 model has updated styling that\u2019s easier on the eyes.",
      "Ioniq 6 starting price: $39,045",
      "The Ridgeline could be an ideal truck for you depending on your priorities. If you plan on frequently towing heavy loads and tackling serious off-road trails, then other midsize trucks like the Ford Ranger would be a better fit. But if not, you should consider the Ridgeline. It\u2019s more comfortable, has more passenger room and handles better than its rivals.",
      "The Ridgeline\u2019s towing capacity is certainly good enough for most uses, such as pulling a small camper trailer or toy hauler. It also has clever features like a lockable in-bed trunk and a tailgate that folds down or swings to the side. Its bed is large enough for 4-foot-wide plywood sheets without resting them on the wheelwells.",
      "Ridgeline starting price: $41,600",
      "Mitsubishi doesn\u2019t sell as many vehicles as giant brands like Chevrolet or Toyota. But the Outlander PHEV is surprisingly capable and versatile. It\u2019s a plug-in hybrid SUV that offers three rows of seating and standard all-wheel drive. If you charge regularly, trips to the gas station will be rare thanks to the Outlander PHEV\u2019s lengthy 38-mile electric range. When the battery runs low, you\u2019ll get a respectable 26 mpg combined.",
      "With the third row folded down, the Outlander PHEV offers lots of cargo space. When it\u2019s up, you\u2019ll have room for seven passengers, but the third row is only large enough for kids. Its starting price isn\u2019t low because it\u2019s a plug-in hybrid, but the Mitsubishi comes well equipped, and the top SEL trim level is quite luxurious.",
      "2025 Outlander PHEV starting price: $42,040",
      "The Crown is a relatively new Toyota that turns heads with its distinctive design. Its styling is similar to a sedan\u2019s, but the Crown has a raised ride height that\u2019s more like a crossover SUV\u2019s. Oh, and it\u2019s a hybrid too. The base engine is a fuel sipper that gets an EPA-estimated 41 mpg combined. The optional Hybrid Max engine produces an impressive 340 horsepower for quick acceleration, but fuel economy dips to 30 mpg combined.",
      "Inside, the Crown has a pleasing interior with large display screens, spacious seating and a comfortable ride. But all this comes at a cost. The Crown is pricey for a non-luxury hybrid sedan, especially the top Platinum trim that has the Hybrid Max engine.",
      "2025 Crown starting price: $42,575",
      "The G90 has everything you want in a large, lavish sedan except for brand cachet. Genesis is still relatively new in the luxury world, but its vehicles, especially the flagship G90, shouldn\u2019t be overlooked. This South Korean sedan touts style, power, exceptional comfort, and an opulent cabin with superb fit and finish. Some rivals offer the same but require an arm and a leg for payment. And you\u2019re mistaken if you think the G90 skimps on features.",
      "The top 3.5T E-Supercharger version doesn\u2019t offer any optional features because it comes equipped with many features, including many that usually cost thousands more than they would on a luxury rival. The most notable ones include front and rear massaging seats, a 26-speaker Bang & Olufsen audio system, a massive package of advanced driver aids, and an air suspension that scans the road ahead so it can adjust to road imperfections.",
      "Starting price: $91,050",
      "You\u2019ll be bucking the trend by purchasing one of these hidden gems. And because they\u2019re all highly rated by Edmunds, you\u2019ll also own a top-notch vehicle that could provide a rewarding experience.",

      "With concern and confusion over how the federal government will respond to disasters this summer, aid groups are readying to expand the ways they help communities after hurricanes, fires and other storms",
      "Volunteers with the humanitarian nonprofit Team Rubicon are accustomed to filling in the gaps of disaster recovery \u2014 they chainsaw downed trees after wildfires, muck out flooded homes and rebuild roofs blown off by hurricanes.",
      "But with concern and confusion over how the federal government will respond to disasters this summer, the group is readying to possibly help in ways it hasn\u2019t before.",
      "\u201cThe one thing certain this hurricane season is the uncertainty of what\u2019s going to happen at the federal level,\u201d said Jeff Byard, Team Rubicon senior vice president of operations.",
      "Byard and his team are evaluating how else they can help communities if the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which oversees federal response to disasters, reduces its capacity or is deployed less often. President Donald Trump has repeatedly expressed his intent to overhaul FEMA, if not totally dismantle it.",
      "Team Rubicon is good at being agile, Byard said, but nonprofits and funders are already under pressure from more frequent and severe climate events. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be harder in a really hard situation already,\u201d he said.",
      "Experts worry Trump might approve fewer major disaster declarations, which unlock federal funding and resources, and that FEMA\u2019s response could be slowed or diminished. Trainings have been reduced, and around 2,000 employees have left or been fired since January, including high-level staff.",
      "\"Whether it's a hurricane or earthquake, the federal government is not prepared the way it has been in the past,\u201d said Michael Coen, who held posts at FEMA under three presidential administrations.",
      "Nonprofits and funders across the United States say there is too much at stake for communities to just wait and see what happens. \u201cFrom the nonprofit perspective, we have to really lean in,\u201d said Marcus Coleman, vice president of community resilience strategy for United Way Worldwide.",
      "FEMA is \u201cfully activated in preparation for Hurricane Season,\u201d and is \u201cshifting from bloated DC-centric dead weight to a lean, deployable disaster force that empowers state actors to provide relief for their citizens,\" according to a spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees the agency.",
      "Leaders in disaster relief say FEMA\u2019s absence would make it harder to coordinate resources across federal government, set up effective communications, and deploy emergency supplies. \u201cFEMA is a key partner, we need them,\u201d said David Guadalupe, chair of the National Voluntary Organizations Active in Disaster.",
      "They worry the sudden policy changes could leave many states unprepared and under-resourced, intensifying the need for donations and volunteers.",
      "\u201cThe worst case scenario is that that money gets pulled back and we have to fill in those gaps,\u201d said Ann Lee, CEO of the relief organization CORE.",
      "It would be especially difficult, they say, to replace the services under FEMA\u2019s Individual Assistance program, like temporary housing and grants to repair or replace damaged homes and vehicles.",
      "For direct assistance alone, FEMA has approved over $460 million for 160,000 households in North Carolina since Hurricane Helene, and more than $136 million for 34,500 households after the Los Angeles fires.",
      "\u201cIf the funding to the people gets eliminated, that\u2019s all they have,\u201d said Michael Capponi, president of Global Empowerment Mission, adding that while nonprofits are often faster and more efficient at getting people help, they still need the money to make it happen. \u201cThe private sector can never take that on,\u201d he said.",
      "FEMA also funds disaster case managers, who help survivors navigate paperwork, and legal and mental health support. Providing those services \u201cwill require even more robust volunteer organization,\u201d said Byard.",
      "Other needs could include supporting smaller, less experienced emergency management departments, collecting data about survivor needs, or hauling away debris if federal dollars don't pay for the pickup.",
      "Even when FEMA help is available, it could look different than recent years, said Coleman. He points out that the agency already canceled its door-to-door canvassing program that helped survivors enroll with FEMA, and worries the feds could give survivors less time to apply. \u201cThe effort to get the word out about FEMA assistance is critically important,\u201d he said. \u201cNonprofits will have to move quickly.\u201d",
      "Relief organizations like CORE and Good360 are also pre-positioning more supplies in storm-vulnerable areas, in part in case FEMA supplies arrive more slowly. Trump took up to eight weeks to approve some declaration requests this spring, making aid groups even more important as survivors waited for help. \u201cThat preparation is the biggest thing to focus on,\u201d said Lee.",
      "The new responsibilities could come at a time when states, nonprofits and funders are already under strain from worsening disasters and federal funding cuts across government.",
      "A United Way Worldwide survey of the 211 network found that referrals for disaster-related assistance rose over 50% in 2024. Nonprofits have also been weakened by losing federal grants as well as staff from AmeriCorps cuts.",
      "\u201cThe groups in the community 365 days a year are getting beat up significantly,\u201d said Noah Patton, director of disaster recovery at the National Low-Income Housing Coalition, adding community-based organizations are already under pressure from housing shortages and other crises.",
      "\u201cWhen you're working at a homeless shelter that is 100% utilized and then you drop a disaster on it, it\u2019s \u2018How will I continue to do my job,\u2019 not \u2018How can I expand my mission.\u2019\u201d",
      "Funders that fuel recovery work say they can\u2019t replace federal money. \u201cIt\u2019s not just unrealistic, it\u2019s a dangerous abdication of public responsibility,\u201d said Ryan Eller, executive director of the Appalachia Funders Network. \u201cThere\u2019s a reason these agencies were brought about in the first place when local resources just can\u2019t meet the need.\u201d",
      "Philanthropy committed over $300 million to recovery to Hurricane Helene alone, and hundreds of millions more each for the fires in LA and on Maui. Eller said it\u2019s getting harder to fundraise for recovery. \u201cThere is a general fatigue around disaster philanthropy because of the volume and frequency of storms,\u201d he said.",
      "Even if a nonprofit can't take on more, simply building relationships with state and local government, residents, and fellow relief groups ahead of an emergency will make everyone more prepared, said Byard. \u201cTake FEMA out of it, now we\u2019re really looking at communities supporting communities,\u201d he said. \u201cThat can build some really really strong resilience.\u201d",

      "Among the main announcements is expected to be a 30 billion-pound ($41 billion) increase in funding for Britain's cherished but struggling National Health Service, as well as a rise in defense spending that will account for 2.5% of national output by 2027. Billions more are expected for social housing as the government aims to meet its target of building 1.5 million new homes by the next election.",

      "South Korea\u2019s military has shut down loudspeakers broadcasting anti-North Korean propaganda along the inter-Korean border",
      "SEOUL, South Korea -- South Korea\u2019s military has shut down loudspeakers broadcasting anti-North Korea propaganda along the inter-Korean border, marking the new liberal government\u2019s first concrete step toward easing tensions between the war-divided rivals.",
      "The South resumed the loudspeaker broadcasts in June last year following a yearslong pause in retaliation for North Korea flying trash-laden balloons toward the South in a psychological warfare campaign.",
      "South Korea\u2019s Defense Ministry said Wednesday that the move was part of efforts to \u201cto restore trust in inter-Korean relations and promote peace on the Korean Peninsula.\u201d",
      "North Korea, which is extremely sensitive to any outside criticism of its authoritarian leadership and its third-generation ruler, Kim Jong Un, didn't immediately comment on the step by Seoul.",
      "From May to November last year, North Korea flew about 7,000 balloons toward South Korea in 32 separate events to drop substances such as wastepaper, cloth scraps, cigarette butts and even manure. The North said that its balloon campaign came after South Korean activists sent over balloons filled with anti-North Korean leaflets, as well as USB sticks filled with popular South Korean songs and dramas.",
      "Trash carried by at least one North Korean balloon fell on the South Korean presidential compound in July, raising concerns about the vulnerability of key South Korean facilities. Officials said that the balloon contained no dangerous material and no one was hurt.",
      "South Korea, in response to the North Korean balloons, reactivated its front-line loudspeakers to blast propaganda messages and K-pop songs toward the North. The playlist was clearly designed to strike the nerve of Pyongyang, as Kim\u2019s government since the COVID-19 pandemic has been intensifying a campaign to eliminate the influence of South Korean pop culture and language among the population in a bid to strengthen his family\u2019s dynastic rule.",
      "The Cold War-style psychological warfare campaigns added to tensions fueled by North Korea\u2019s growing nuclear ambitions and South Korean efforts to expand joint military exercises with the United States and strengthen three-way security cooperation with Japan.",
      "South Korea\u2019s new liberal president, Lee Jae-myung, who took office last week after winning an early election to replace ousted conservative Yoon Suk Yeol, has vowed to improve relations with Pyongyang, which reacted furiously to Yoon\u2019s hard-line policies and shunned dialogue.",
      "During the election campaign, Lee promised to halt the loudspeaker broadcasts, arguing that they created unnecessary tensions and discomfort for South Korean residents in border towns. In recent months, those residents had complained about North Korea\u2019s retaliatory broadcasts, which included howling animals, pounding gongs and other irritating sounds.",
      "In a briefing on Monday, South Korea\u2019s Unification Ministry, which handles inter-Korean affairs, also called for South Korean civilian activists to stop flying anti-North Korean propaganda leaflets across the border. Such activities \u201ccould heighten tensions on the Korean Peninsula and threaten the lives and safety of residents in border areas,\u201d said Koo Byoungsam, the ministry\u2019s spokesperson.",
      "In his inaugural address last week, Lee vowed to reopen communication channels with North Korea to ease tensions. But prospects for an early resumption of dialogue between the rival Koreas remain dim, as North Korea has consistently rejected offers from South Korea and the United States since 2019, when nuclear talks between Washington and Pyongyang collapsed over sanctions-related disagreements.",
      "North Korea\u2019s priority in foreign policy is now firmly with Russia, which has received thousands of North Korean troops and large amounts of military equipment in recent months for its war with Ukraine.",
      "Yoon, who was removed from office in April over his short-lived imposition of martial law in December, had focused on strengthening military partnerships with Washington and Tokyo and on securing stronger U.S. assurances of a swift and decisive nuclear response to defend the South against a North Korean attack.",
      "In a fierce reaction to Yoon\u2019s policies, Kim in January 2024 declared that he was abandoning the long-standing goals of a peaceful unification with the South and instructed the rewriting of the North\u2019s constitution to cement the South as a permanent \u201cprincipal enemy.\u201d",

      "Stocks have soared higher since dropping roughly 20% below their record two months ago, when President Donald Trump shocked financial markets  with his announcement of stiff tariffs that raised worries about a possible recession.

      "Spain\u2019s economy minister Carlos Cuerpo says the millions of tourists who visit the country every year pose a challenge for Spain's residents that the government can no longer afford to ignore",
      "MADRID -- Spain's economy minister says the millions of tourists who visit the country every year present a challenge for Spain's residents that the government can no longer afford to ignore.",
      "Last year, Spain received a record 94 million international visitors, making it one of the most visited countries in the world. It could receive as many as 100 million tourists this year, according to some projections.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s important to understand that these record numbers in terms of tourism also pose challenges,\u201d Economy Minister Carlos Cuerpo said in an interview Tuesday with The Associated Press. \u201cAnd we need to deal with those challenges also for our own population.\u201d",
      "Tourism is a key sector for the Southern European nation's economy, which grew faster than any major advanced economy last year at 3.2%, and is projected to grow at 2.4% this year, according to the Bank of Spain, well ahead of the expected eurozone average of 0.9%.",
      "But a stubborn housing crisis in which home and rental costs have skyrocketed in cities such as Madrid, Barcelona and elsewhere has led to growing frustration about one aspect tied to tourism in particular: the proliferation of short-term rental apartments in city centers.",
      "The country has seen several large protests that have drawn tens of thousands of people to demand more government action on housing. Signs at demonstrations with slogans such as \u201cGet Airbnb out of our neighborhoods\u201d point to the growing anger.",
      "In response, the government recently announced it was cracking down on Airbnb listings that it said were operating in the country illegally, a decision that the company is appealing.",
      "\u201cWe are a 49 million-inhabitants country,\" Cuerpo said. The record numbers of tourists illustrate the \u201cattractiveness of our country, but also of the challenge that we have in terms of dealing and providing for a good experience for tourists, but at the same time avoiding overcharging (for) our own services and our own housing,\u201d he said.",
      "The Bank of Spain recently said the country has a deficit of 450,000 homes. Building more public housing is critical to solve the problem, Cuerpo said. Spain has a lower stock of public housing than many other major European Union countries.",
      "\u201cThis is the key challenge for this term,\u201d the minister said of the country's housing woes.",
      "On the possibility of more U.S. tariffs on EU goods, the top economic policymaker for the eurozone's fourth-largest economy said he believed the EU still wanted to reinforce economic ties with the U.S.",
      "\u201cFrom the EU side, we are constructive but we are not naive,\" Cuerpo said, adding that the bloc would pursue \u201cother routes protecting our firms and industries\u201d if no agreement with the Trump administration can be reached.",
      "A 90-day pause on tariffs announced by the EU and the U.S. is slated to end on July 14. About halfway through that grace period, U.S. President Donald Trump announced 50% tariffs on steel imports. The U.S. has also enacted a 25% tariff on vehicles and 10% so-called reciprocal tariffs on most other goods.",
      "On how Spain's current housing woes got here, the minister said a steep drop in construction in Spain following the 2008 financial crisis played a role. So did population growth due to immigration, Cuerpo said, and pressures from an increase in the number of tourists.",
      "While building more housing is key, the minister advocated for an all-of-the-above approach, including regulating Spain's housing market and short-term rental platforms.",
      "\u201cFor us, there\u2019s no silver bullet,\u201d he said.",

      "An international rights group says several global brands are among dozens of companies at risk of using forced labor through their Chinese supply chains",
      "LONDON -- Several global brands are among dozens of companies at risk of using forced labor through their Chinese supply chains because they use critical minerals or buy minerals-based products sourced from China's far-western Xinjiang region, an international rights group said Wednesday.",
      "The report by the Netherlands-based Global Rights Compliance says companies including Avon, Walmart, Nescafe, Coca-Cola and paint supplier Sherwin-Williams may be linked to titanium sourced from Xinjiang, where rights groups allege the Chinese government runs coercive labor practices targeting predominantly Muslim Uyghurs and other Turkic minorities.",
      "The report comes as China and the United States, the world's two largest economies, continue talks aimed at easing their trade dispute.",
      "The report found 77 Chinese suppliers in the titanium, lithium, beryllium and magnesium industries operating in Xinjiang. It said the suppliers are at risk of participating in the Chinese government's \u201clabor transfer programs,\" in which Uyghurs are forced to work in factories as part of a longstanding campaign of assimilation and mass detention.",
      "Commercial paints, thermos cups and components for the aerospace, auto and defense industries are among products sold internationally that can trace their supply chains to minerals from Xinjiang, the report said. It said companies must review their supply chains.",
      "\u201cMineral mining and processing in (Xinjiang) rely in part on the state\u2019s forced labor programs for Uyghurs and other Turkic people in the region,\u201d the report said.",

      "A 2022 United Nations report found China may have committed crimes against humanity in Xinjiang, where more than 1 million Uyghurs are estimated to have been arbitrarily detained as part of measures the Chinese government said were intended to target terrorism and separatism.",
      "The Chinese government has rejected the U.N. claims and defended its actions in Xinjiang as fighting terror and ensuring stability.",
      "In 2021, former U.S. President Joe Biden signed a law to block imports from the Xinjiang region unless businesses can prove the items were made without forced labor. The law initially targeted solar products, tomatoes, cotton and apparel, but the U.S. government recently added new sectors for enforcement, including aluminum and seafood.",
      "A recent report by the International Energy Agency said the world\u2019s sources of critical minerals are increasingly concentrated in a few countries, notably China, which is also a leading refining and processing base for lithium, cobalt, graphite and other minerals.",
      "Many of China's major minerals corporations have invested in the exploration and mining of lithium, a key component for electric vehicle batteries, in Xinjiang, Global Rights Compliance said. Xinjiang is also China's top source of beryllium, a mineral used for aerospace, defense and telecommunications, its report said.",

      "A federal judge has tossed out a lawsuit over President Donald Trump's dismantling of a U.S. federal agency that invests in African small businesses.",
      "U.S. District Judge Richard Leon in Washington, D.C., dismissed the case on Tuesday, finding that Trump was acting within his legal authority when he fired the U.S. African Development Foundation's board members in February. In March, the same judge ruled that the administration's removal of most grant money and staff from the congressionally created agency was also legal, as long as the agency was maintained at the minimum level required by law.",
      "USADF was created as an independent agency in 1980, and its board members must be confirmed by the U.S. Senate. In 2023, Congress allocated $46 million to the agency to invest in small agricultural and energy infrastructure projects and other economic development initiatives in 22 African countries.",
      "On Feb. 19, Trump issued an executive order that said USADF, the U.S. Institute of Peace, the Inter-American Foundation and the Presidio Trust should be scaled back to the minimum presence required by law. At the time, USADF had five of its seven board seats filled. A few days later, an administration official told Ward Brehm that he was fired, and emails were sent to the other board members notifying them that they had also been terminated.",
      "Those emails were never received, however, because they were sent to the wrong email addresses. The four board members, believing they still held their posts because they had not been given notice, met in March and passed a resolution appointing Brehm as the president of the board.",
      "But Trump had already appointed Pete Marocco as the new chairman of what the administration believed to now be a board of one. Since then, both men have claimed to be the president of the agency, and Brehm filed the lawsuit March 6.",
      "Leon said that even though they didn't receive the emails, the four board members were effectively terminated in February, and so they didn't have the authority to appoint Brehm to lead the board.",
      "Brehm\u2019s attorney, Bradley Girard with Democracy Forward, expressed disappointment with the judge's decision.",

      "That lawsuit is still pending before the same judge. In that case, two USADF staffers and a consulting firm based in Zambia that works closely with USADF contend that the Trump administration's efforts to deeply scale back the agency wrongly usurps Congress' powers. They also say Marocco was unlawfully appointed to the board, in part because he was never confirmed by the Senate as required.",

      "U.S. inflation likely picked up a bit last month as President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs start to bite, but lower prices for gas and possibly for air fares and used cars may limit the overall increase",
      "WASHINGTON -- U.S. inflation likely picked up a bit last month as President Donald Trump's tariffs start to bite, but lower prices for gas and possibly for air fares and used cars may limit the overall increase.",
      "The government's inflation report, to be released Wednesday, is forecast to show that consumer prices rose 2.5% in May compared with a year ago, according to economists surveyed by data provider FactSet. That would be the first increase in four months and up from 2.3% in April. Excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core prices are projected to have risen 2.9% in May from a year earlier, up from 2.8% in April.",
      "Trump's tariffs are expected to contribute to the uptick by raising the cost of some imports, including clothes, furniture, appliances, and possibly new cars. Many retailers and some consumer products companies have said they have plans to raise prices or have already done so to cover the cost of the import duties.",
      "On a monthly basis, prices are expected to have moved up 0.2% from April to May, while core prices are forecast to have increased 0.3%. At that pace, core prices would rise much faster than the Federal Reserve's 2% target. Economists and the inflation-fighters at the Fed focus on core inflation because it often provides a better sense of where inflation is headed.",
      "Inflation has cooled in the past year and, excluding the impact of tariffs, economists say it would be on track to return to the Fed's target, which would allow the central bank to cut its key interest rates. Yet core prices have been more stubborn and were stuck between 3.2% and 3.4% for nearly a year until February, when they started to decline a bit.",
      "Last week, the Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics, which compiles the inflation data, said it is reducing the amount of data it collects for each inflation report. Economists have expressed concern about the cutback, and while it isn't clear how sharp the reduction is, most analysts say it is likely to have a minor impact. Still, any reduction in data collection could make the figures more volatile.",
      "Nearly all economists expect Trump's duties will make many things more expensive in the second half of this year, including cars and groceries, though by how much is still uncertain. Trump has slapped 30% tariffs on all imports from China, plus a 10% baseline tariff on imported goods from every other country, and 50% import taxes on steel and aluminum.",
      "Given the potential for higher prices in the coming months, Fed Chair Jerome Powell and other Fed officials have made clear they will keep their key rate unchanged until they have a better sense of how tariffs will affect the economy.",
      "The full impact of the tariffs likely won't be felt until the second half of the year, analysts say, even though many tariffs have been in place, in one form or another, since March and April. There are several reasons it can take months for the duties to fully pass through into retail prices.",
      "To begin with, many companies tried to beat the clock by bringing in foreign goods before Trump\u2019s tariffs took effect, producing a flood of imports in March. As a result, they have stockpiled goods in warehouses that weren't hit by tariffs and so don't have to raise prices yet.",
      "Many companies also held off on hiking prices during the chaos of April and May, when Trump announced sweeping tariffs on imports from nearly 60 countries, only to put them on hold a week later. He also ramped up duties on China to 145%, essentially cutting off trade with the United States' third-largest trading partner. Imports fell sharply in April as a result. The U.S. and China last month agreed to lower duties, with the U.S. now taxing Chinese imports 30%.",
      "For many firms, it wasn't worth it to raise prices until they had a better sense of where tariffs would settle. It's possible some duties could fall further if the Trump administration is able to reach trade deals in negotiations with China, the European Union, Japan and other countries.",
      "Still, Bryan Eshelman, a partner and managing director at consulting firm AlixPartners, said higher prices \u201care coming.\u201d",
      "Eshelman expects that shoppers will start feeling the impact in July, and predicts prices for back-to-school items like clothing and backpacks could go up anywhere from 5% to 15%. Retailers may add surcharges tied to higher tariffs costs at the cash register starting in September, he said.",
      "\u201cI think that that\u2019s something that retailers are going to be loathe to pull out and do. And so I think they will wait to see how things unfold, \u201d he said.",
      "Most imported goods are actually parts or raw materials for larger products, such as the steel and aluminum goods now facing 50% duties. It will take time for those costs to filter through the supply chain and affect prices.",
      "Some stores, however, have already said they will implement higher prices, including Best Buy, Walmart and Lululemon.",
      "It was only last month when Trump ripped into Walmart after the nation\u2019s largest retailer boldly warned that prices are already starting to go up on items like bananas. Walmart\u2019s chief financial officer John David Rainey told The Associated Press that a car seat that currently sells for $350 at Walmart will likely cost customers another $100.",
      "Rainey also told analysts at an Oppenheimer investor conference on Monday that for some items, Walmart will reduce inventory by as much as 20% because it expects higher prices will reduce demand, and it doesn\u2019t want to be stuck with leftover inventory.",

      "President Donald Trump likes to say he\u2019s bringing in trillions of dollars in investments from foreign countries",
      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 President Donald Trump likes to say he's bringing in trillions of dollars in investments from foreign countries, but a provision in his tax cuts bill could cause international companies to avoid expanding into the United States.",
      "The House-passed version of the legislation would allow the federal government to impose taxes on foreign-parented companies and investors from countries judged as charging \u201cunfair foreign taxes\u201d on U.S. companies.",
      "Known as Section 899, the measure could cause companies to avoid investing in the the U.S. out of concern they could face steep taxes. The fate of the measure rests with the Senate \u2014 setting off a debate about its prospects and impact.",
      "A new analysis by the Global Business Alliance, a trade group representing international companies such as Toyota and Nestl\u00e9, estimates that the provision would cost the U.S. 360,000 jobs and $55 billion annually over 10 years in lost gross domestic product. The analysis estimates that the tax could cut a third off the economic growth anticipated from the overall tax cuts by Congress' Joint Committee on Taxation.",
      "\"While proponents say this punitive tax hike is intended as a retaliatory measure against foreign governments, this report confirms that the real victims are American workers in states like North Carolina, South Carolina, Indiana, Tennessee and Texas,\" said Jonathan Samford, president and CEO of the Global Business Alliance.",
      "Republican Rep. Jason Smith of Missouri, chair of the House Ways and Means Committee, has defended the provision as protecting U.S. interests by giving the president a tool that can be used against countries with tax codes that, in the federal government's opinion, put American companies at a disadvantage.",
      "\u201cIf these countries withdraw these taxes and decide to behave, we will have achieved our goal,\" Smith said in a statement last week. \"It\u2019s just common sense. I urge my colleagues in the Senate to move quickly to pass this bill and protect Americans from economic bad actors around the world.\u201d",
      "The tax gets at a fundamental tension within Trump's policy agenda: a contradiction in the broad strokes of Trump simultaneously trying to tax imports and foreign profits at higher rates while also seeking investments from companies headquartered abroad.",
      "In late May, Trump defended his approach by saying that his tariffs were causing more countries to invest in the U.S. to avoid imports getting taxed. While some countries and companies have made announcements, there is not evidence of the investments pushing up spending on new factories as measured in the government's monthly report on construction spending.",
      "The Republican president said his tendency to impose steep tariffs, then retreat to lower rates, had succeeded.",
      "\u201cWe have $14 trillion now invested, committed to investing,\u201d Trump said then. \u201cYou know we have the hottest country anywhere in the world. I went to Saudi Arabia, the king told me, he said, you got the hottest -- we have the hottest country in the world right now.\u201d",
      "The Global Business Alliance was among the groups that signed a letter on Monday warning of the consequences of Section 899 to Senate Majority Leader John Thune of South Dakota and Senate Finance Committee Chairman Mike Crapo of Idaho, both Republicans.",
      "The Investment Company Institute, representing financial firms, said the provision \u201ccould limit foreign investment to the U.S. \u2014 a key driver of growth in American capital markets that ultimately benefits American families saving for their futures.\u201d",
      "The analysis performed by EY Quantitative Economics and Statistics notes there is a degree of uncertainty in how the taxes under Section 899 could be implemented. But they could be charged against companies based in countries that tax digital services, as is the case in parts of Europe.",
      "If the U.S. judged the taxes unfair, there would be a 30% tax rate on foreign companies' profits and income. People working in the U.S. for the companies who are not citizens could also be taxed, among other provisions.",
      "The possibility of the taxes and seemingly arbitrary nature by which they could be imposed is also a challenge, said Chye-Ching Huang, executive director of New York University's Tax Law Center.",
      "\u201cSection 899 creates a game of political chicken with trade partners that risks harming businesses, consumers, and workers in the hopes of securing US multinationals the ability to shift more of their profits out of the US to tax havens,\" Huang said in an email. \u201cIt\u2019s a high-risk strategy that could expand the damage of the failed tariff war.\u201d",
      "There could also be political repercussions if key states in Trump's political coalition from 2024 suffer layoffs or simply find job growth slowing. The Global Business Alliance finds job losses could amount to 44,200 in Florida, 27,700 in Pennsylvania, 24,500 in North Carolina and 23,500 in Michigan.",

    "story": [
      "Daniel Suarez has become the unofficial tour guide for all things Mexico City as NASCAR prepares to race internationally this Sunday for the first international points-paying Cup Series event of the modern era",
      "MEXICO CITY -- Daniel Suarez has become the unofficial tour guide for all things Mexico City as NASCAR prepares to race internationally this Sunday for the first international points-paying Cup Series event of the modern era.",
      "From where to eat, what to do, how to navigate the city and even basic conversation in Spanish, Suarez has been the go-to guy in the garage since NASCAR said it would take the Cup Series outside the United States for just the third time in 77 years.",
      "The Monterrey native has made multiple trips to NASCAR as the face of Sunday's race at Autodromo Hermanos Rodriguez, where he's raced on a different course layout 13 times, with three wins in NASCAR's Mexico Series.",
      "He'd like to win at the Cup level \u2014 if he pulls it out in his home country Sunday it will be his first victory of this season \u2014 but Suarez is juggling a very difficult balancing act. He's elated to be racing in front of a home crowd, honored to show of the culture and magic of Mexico City, but at the same time tremendously concerned about his NASCAR future.",
      "Suarez is in a contract year with Trackhouse Racing, which has Ross Chastain and Shane van Ginsberg under contract while Connor Zilisch is its development driver and on loan to several teams at lower national levels of NASCAR racing.",
      "Trackhouse only has three Cup Series seats, math Suarez can't ignore as he heads into Sunday ranked 28th in the standings.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not the first time that I\u2019ve been in this position. Definitely the first time with the Mexico race, but it\u2019s not the first time that I\u2019ve been in the position that we have to win or in the position that we have a contract negotiation in the middle of the season,\u201d Suarez said. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely a distraction. I won\u2019t sit here and tell you that it doesn\u2019t really matter. I\u2019m trying to be as smart as possible and to put all this stuff on the side and just do my thing on the track.\u201d",
      "Suarez, the only Mexican-born driver to win a NASCAR national series race, has two Cup victories, three Xfinity Series wins and one Truck Series win. His 2016 championship in the second-tier Xfinity Series made him the only foreign-born driver to win a national series title.",
      "Suarez has faced adversity before, but never like the pressure he's feeling hoping to deliver in front of the local crowd. This weekend in Mexico is special to Suarez, who expects well over 100 of the spectators in attendance Sunday to be friends and family.",
      "They've watched from afar as he's worked his way into the NASCAR spotlight, a journey full of ups and downs that have seen Suarez drive for four different Cup teams. He joined Trackhouse Racing in 2021 and last year signed a one-year extension through 2025.",
      "At the time, he said he wanted to reassess where the program was before signing a long-term deal. But it's been a disappointing start to the season and his average finish of 21st is three spots worse than last year.",
      "\u201cThe Mexico race is something that I\u2019ve been hoping and waiting on for many, many years, and I\u2019m not going to let anything else from outside take that week and that moment from myself,\u201d Suarez said. \u201cWe have to just continue to put one foot in front of the other and continue to move forward. I think that in Trackhouse, we have found some decent speed in the last few weeks, so that\u2019s promising, and hopefully we can continue to move in that direction.\u201d",
      "Suarez will have Mexican communication company Telcel on his car this weekend.",
      "\u201cFor many years, I never had a sponsor deal with a company from Mexico because I wasn\u2019t racing there,\u201d Suarez said. \u201cSo right now that we\u2019re going to be having an event down there, it opens a whole new world of opportunities and that\u2019s great, obviously for me, but for the entire sport.\u201d",
      "It's another layer of pressure for Suarez, who wants nothing more than to balance the demands of being the star of Sunday's show with delivering a strong showing.",
      "\"Once we get into the race, we don\u2019t want to deal with any of this stuff, and I just want to focus and have fun driving race cars,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is going to be more on my plate just by nature, just being the local guy, the very first race ever in Mexico City in the Cup Series. I have to accept that. With that being said, I have to protect my space for the competition stuff because if we don\u2019t do the competition stuff right, everything else doesn\u2019t really matter. So we have to put a balance on everything.\u201d",
      "As Suarez noted, a win on Sunday would dramatically improve his hopes of remaining with Trackhouse on a contract extension. It could happen: Suarez's first Cup victory came on the road course at Sonoma, and the next five Cup races include road-course races at Mexico City, Sonoma and the Chicago street course.",
      "He admitted \u201chonestly, I don't know\u201d about what he'd like out of a contract extension, but said he speaks regularly with team owner Justin Marks.",
      "\u201cThe trajectory of Trackhouse has been tremendous,\u201d Su\u00e1rez said. \u201cWe have learned so many things. I really want to help Justin bring Trackhouse to the next level. I believe that 2022 has been our best year as a company, still. So why is that? Are we missing something? Do we have to change something? What do we need to do better? As a new team, to have your best years that early, it\u2019s kind of uncommon. One of the reasons, I believe, was because of the new car. So I believe that we have to continue to grow.",
      "\u201cRoss just won a race a couple weeks ago, and that\u2019s brought a lot of energy to the team and some more momentum. Before that, it was a little bit of a struggle. So we have to continue to find that speed in a consistent basis, just like the big teams,\" he continued. \"So we\u2019re having all these conversations. I wish I didn\u2019t have to have these conversations, and I didn\u2019t have these distractions, but it\u2019s part of life, right? Sometimes you have to do several things at the same time. But I\u2019m trying not to think about it too much and trying to work in my job and push as hard as possible for competition and trying to help the team slowly get better and better.\u201d",

      "Alistair Docherty suffered the first of what figures to be plenty of crashes. From just short of the 10th green, it took him two hacks to get it out of the cabbage-like rough, the second chip rolling and rolling some 12 feet by the hole.",
      "That's what Oakmont does \u2014 thick, gnarly rough and some of the fastest putting surfaces around. The USGA pointed out on the eve of the championship that only 27 of the 1,385 players who have competed in a major championship at Oakmont finished under par.",

European teams dominated the modern era, winning all but one of the last 17 editions.",

      "FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. -- Leading the Stanley Cup Final 2-1, the Florida Panthers can move to the verge of a second consecutive championship if they beat the Edmonton Oilers in Game 4 at home Thursday night.",
      "The Panthers were upbeat and relaxed at their final full practice before the potential swing game, with players downplaying the gravity of the situation.",
      "\u201cI feel like every game\u2019s so big during this time,\" center Anton Lundell said Wednesday. \u201cThe stakes gets higher. Everybody wants to win. But we both know for both teams it\u2019s a big game, and we want to be good.\u201d",
      "They were more than good in Game 3, routing the Oilers 6-1 to take control of a series that looked evenly matched after a bunch of overtime hockey and a split in Edmonton.",
      "\u201cUsually you get teams\u2019 best after that, I think especially with the players they have in the room, how competitive they are, they\u2019re going to look to bounce back,\" said Brad Marchand, who is tied with teammate Sam Bennett for the most goals in the final with four apiece. \"When you have that kind of leadership, they normally lead the way, those top guys. That\u2019s a dangerous combination. We have to make sure that we bring our best.\u201d",
      "The Panthers are nearing full strength at a time of year usually known for players gutting through injuries, with Paul Maurice saying Sam Reinhart is back healthy and Matthew Tkachuk looks like he is rounding into form. The Oilers are missing Zach Hyman because of his playoff-ending wrist injury, and fellow top-line forward Ryan Nugent-Hopkins is dealing with something that is keeping him off the ice for practices and making him a game-time decision.",
      "That discrepancy could make a difference in their Cup final rematch. One thing that is the same is Florida locking in and normalizing pressure situations like this.",
      "\u201cOur approach, it\u2019s pretty similar the entire playoffs,\" said Bennett, who leads all scorers this postseason with 14 goals. \"Whether it\u2019s Game 1 or Game 7, we play the same style. We play just as hard. We\u2019re not sitting back, so we really are not going to be changing anything in this next game or any other games to come.\u201d",

      "In a June 7 Boston Herald feature on Dobbins that ran the day before he allowed three runs and four hits in five innings of an 11-7 win over the Yankees, he said that his father, Lance Dobbins, had been drafted twice by the Yankees before being traded to the Arizona Diamondbacks. The story also makes reference to Dobbins saying his father was friends with Andy Pettitte, who played 15 major league seasons with New York.",
      "But the Post report found no evidence of any of that, citing multiple official databases and the Yankees' own records that couldn't substantiate Lance Dobbins having played with the organization.

      "U.S. District Judge Claudia Wilken approved the settlement last week, clearing the way for direct payments from universities to athletes and the end of the NCAA's amateurism model.",
      "The athletes who appealed the settlement competed in soccer, volleyball and track. They are Kacie Breeding of Vanderbilt; Lexi Drumm, Emma Appleman, Emmie Wannemacher, Riley Hass, Savannah Baron and Elizabeth Arnold of the College of Charleston; and Kate Johnson of Virginia. They have standing to appeal because they previously filed objections to the proposed settlement.",
      "Ashlyn Hare, one of the attorneys representing the athletes, said in a statement that the settlement violates Title IX, the federal law that bans sex-based discrimination in education.",
      "\u201cWe support a settlement of the case, but not an inaccurate one that violates federal law. The calculation of past damages is based on an error that ignores Title IX and deprives female athletes of $1.1 billion,\u201d Hare said. \u201cPaying out the money as proposed would be a massive error that would cause irreparable harm to women\u2019s sports.\u201d",
      "The law firm representing the plaintiffs in the settlement issued a statement saying the appeal would delay payments to hundreds of thousands of athletes by a minimum of several months.",
      "\u201cThese attorneys are pursuing an appeal based on a Title IX issue that Judge Wilken already disposed of correctly, quickly and multiple times,\u201d the statement said.",
      "The House settlement figures to financially benefit football and basketball stars at the biggest schools, who are likely to receive a big chunk of the $20.5 million per year that colleges are permitted to share with athletes over the next year. Some athletes in other sports that don't make money for their schools could lose their partial scholarships or see their roster spots cut.",
      "\u201cThis is a football and basketball damages settlement with no real benefit to female athletes,\u201d Hare said. \u201cCongress has expressly rejected efforts to exempt revenue-generating sports like football and basketball from Title IX\u2019s antidiscrimination mandate. The NCAA agreed with us. Our argument on appeal is the exact same argument the conferences and NCAA made prior to settling the case.\u201d",

      "Adams, who captained the U.S. at the 2022 World Cup, funded a pair of mini-pitches at Pulaski Park in Poughkeepsie, New York, near his home in Wappinger. He spoke on the Zoom about his work with Allstate, the U.S. Soccer Foundation and Black Star Soccer to construct fields about the size of basketball courts at the Fisher Magnet Upper Academy in Detroit and The Bell Avenue School in Yeadon, Pennsylvania.",
      "\u201cBefore the World Cup hopefully we plan to do one more with a city unnamed yet,\u201d Adams said. \u201cIt\u2019s something that I think has real impact, continues to grow the sport, serves underserved communities.\u201d",
      "Now 26, Adams is feeling back to his old self. He had back surgery last July with Dr. Robert Watkins and returned to the field with England's Bournemouth on Oct. 26. Adams played in 28 Premier League matches this season after being limited to three in 2023-24 because of leg injuries.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s definitely enjoyable when you\u2019re healthy,\u201d he said. \"The 16-to-18 months that it was just on and off inconsistency is something I never had in my career and never had to battle.

      "\u201cFrom a positional standpoint, obviously we had probably a little bit of a different structure under Gregg,\u201d Adams said. \u201cMaurizio gives the players freedom to find spots they\u2019re comfortable in and see how they can affect the game in different ways. I think our attacking players definitely have freedom to try and find the ball and create things in the right areas of the field. So, yeah, I think he gives everyone freedom, but there\u2019s still structure to the way that we want to play.\u201d",

You look at your schedule when the season comes out and you have to play in a row Arsenal, Tottenham, Man City, Liverpool, Manchester United, all these big games back to back to back you just learn how to make decisions quicker and if you don\u2019t, you get punished.\"",

      "New research says long-billed curlews listen to alarm barks from prairie dog colonies to protect themselves from predators",
      "WASHINGTON -- Prairie dogs are the Paul Reveres of the Great Plains: They bark to alert neighbors to the presence of predators, with separate calls for dangers coming by land or by air.",
      "\u201cPrairie dogs are on the menu for just about every predator you can think of\u201d\u2014 golden eagles, red-tailed hawks, foxes, badgers, even large snakes \u2014 said Andy Boyce, a research ecologist in Montana at the Smithsonian's National Zoo and Conservation Biology Institute.",
      "Those predators will also snack on grassland nesting birds like the long-billed curlew.",
      "To protect themselves, the curlews eavesdrop on the alarms coming from prairie dog colonies, according to research published Thursday in the journal Animal Behavior.",
      "Previous research has shown birds frequently eavesdrop on other bird species to glean information about potential food sources or approaching danger, said Georgetown University ornithologist Emily Williams, who was not involved in the study. But, so far, scientists have documented only a few instances of birds eavesdropping on mammals.",
      "\u201cThat doesn\u2019t necessarily mean it\u2019s rare in the wild,\u201d she said, \u201cit just means we haven\u2019t studied it yet.\u201d",
      "Prairie dogs live in large colonies with a series of burrows that may stretch for miles underground. When they hear one each other\u2019s barks, they either stand alert watching or dive into their burrows to avoid approaching talons and claws.",
      "\u201cThose little barks are very loud \u2014 they can carry quite a long way,\u201d said co-author Andrew Dreelin, who also works for the Smithsonian.",
      "The long-billed curlew nests in short-grass prairie and incubates eggs on a ground nest. When one hears the prairie dog alarm, she responds by pressing her head, beak and belly close to the ground.",
      "In this crouched position, the birds \u201crely on the incredible camouflage of their feathers to become essentially invisible on the Plains,\u201d Dreelin said.",
      "To test just how alert the birds were to prairie dog chatter, researchers created a fake predator by strapping a taxidermied badger onto a small remote-controlled vehicle. They sent this badger rolling over the prairie of north-central Montana toward curlew nests \u2014 sometimes in silence and sometimes while playing recorded prairie dog barks.",
      "When the barks were played, curlews ducked into the grass quickly, hiding when the badger was around 160 feet (49 meters) away. Without the barks, the remote-controlled badger got within about 52 feet (16 meters) of the nests before the curlews appeared to sense danger.",
      "\u201cYou have a much higher chance of avoiding predation if you go into that cryptic posture sooner \u2014 and the birds do when they hear prairie dogs barking,\u201d said co-author Holly Jones, a conservation biologist at Northern Illinois University.",
      "Prairie dogs are often thought of as \u201cenvironmental engineers,\u201d she said, because they construct extensive burrows and nibble down prairie grass, keeping short-grass ecosystems intact.",
      "\u201cBut now we are realizing they are also shaping the ecosystems by producing and spreading information,\u201d she said.",

      "\u201cIt is a prudent decision to start with public domain data because that\u2019s less controversial right now than content that\u2019s still under copyright,\u201d said Burton Davis, a deputy general counsel at Microsoft.",
      "Davis said libraries also hold \u201csignificant amounts of interesting cultural, historical and language data\u201d that's missing from the past few decades of online commentary that AI chatbots have mostly learned from.",
      "Supported by \u201cunrestricted gifts\u201d from Microsoft and ChatGPT maker OpenAI, the Harvard-based Institutional Data Initiative is working with libraries around the world on how to make their historic collections AI-ready in a way that also benefits libraries and the communities they serve.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re trying to move some of the power from this current AI moment back to these institutions,\u201d said Aristana Scourtas, who manages research at Harvard Law School\u2019s Library Innovation Lab. \u201cLibrarians have always been the stewards of data and the stewards of information.\u201d",
      "Harvard's newly released dataset, Institutional Books 1.0, contains more than 394 million scanned pages of paper. One of the earlier works is from the 1400s \u2014 a Korean painter\u2019s handwritten thoughts about cultivating flowers and trees. The largest concentration of works is from the 19th century, on subjects such as literature, philosophy, law and agriculture, all of it meticulously preserved and organized by generations of librarians.",
      "It promises to be a boon for AI developers trying to improve the accuracy and reliability of their systems.",
      "\u201cA lot of the data that\u2019s been used in AI training has not come from original sources,\u201d said the data initiative's executive director, Greg Leppert, who is also chief technologist at Harvard's Berkman Klein Center for Internet & Society. This book collection goes \"all the way back to the physical copy that was scanned by the institutions that actually collected those items,\u201d he said.",
      "Before ChatGPT sparked a commercial AI frenzy, most AI researchers didn\u2019t think much about the provenance of the passages of text they pulled from Wikipedia, from social media forums like Reddit and sometimes from deep repositories of pirated books. They just needed lots of what computer scientists call tokens \u2014 units of data, each of which can represent a piece of a word.",
      "Harvard\u2019s new AI training collection has an estimated 242 billion tokens, an amount that's hard for humans to fathom but it's still just a drop of what's being fed into the most advanced AI systems. Facebook parent company Meta, for instance, has said the latest version of its AI large language model was trained on more than 30 trillion tokens pulled from text, images and videos.",
      "Meta is also battling a lawsuit from comedian Sarah Silverman and other published authors who accuse the company of stealing their books from \u201cshadow libraries\u201d of pirated works.",
      "Now, with some reservations, the real libraries are standing up.",
      "OpenAI, which is also fighting a string of copyright lawsuits, donated $50 million this year to a group of research institutions including Oxford University's 400-year-old Bodleian Library, which is digitizing rare texts and using AI to help transcribe them.",
      "When the company first reached out to the Boston Public Library, one of the biggest in the U.S., the library made clear that any information it digitized would be for everyone, said Jessica Chapel, its chief of digital and online services.",
      "\u201cOpenAI had this interest in massive amounts of training data. We have an interest in massive amounts of digital objects. So this is kind of just a case that things are aligning,\u201d Chapel said.",
      "Digitization is expensive. It\u2019s been painstaking work, for instance, for Boston's library to scan and curate dozens of New England\u2019s French-language newspapers that were widely read in the late 19th and early 20th century by Canadian immigrant communities from Quebec. Now that such text is of use as training data, it helps bankroll projects that librarians want to do anyway.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve been very clear that, \u2018Hey, we\u2019re a public library,\u2019\" Chapel said. \u201cOur collections are held for public use, and anything we digitized as part of this project will be made public.\u201d",
      "Harvard's collection was already digitized starting in 2006 for another tech giant, Google, in its controversial project to create a searchable online library of more than 20 million books.",
      "Google spent years beating back legal challenges from authors to its online book library, which included many newer and copyrighted works. It was finally settled in 2016 when the U.S. Supreme Court let stand lower court rulings that rejected copyright infringement claims.",
      "Now, for the first time, Google has worked with Harvard to retrieve public domain volumes from Google Books and clear the way for their release to AI developers. Copyright protections in the U.S. typically last for 95 years, and longer for sound recordings.",
      "How useful all of this will be for the next generation of AI tools remains to be seen as the data gets shared Thursday on the Hugging Face platform, which hosts datasets and open-source AI models that anyone can download.",
      "The book collection is more linguistically diverse than typical AI data sources. Fewer than half the volumes are in English, though European languages still dominate, particularly German, French, Italian, Spanish and Latin.",
      "A book collection steeped in 19th century thought could also be \u201cimmensely critical\u201d for the tech industry's efforts to build AI agents that can plan and reason as well as humans, Leppert said.",
      "\u201cAt a university, you have a lot of pedagogy around what it means to reason,\u201d Leppert said. \u201cYou have a lot of scientific information about how to run processes and how to run analyses.\u201d",
      "At the same time, there's also plenty of outdated data, from debunked scientific and medical theories to racist narratives.",
      "\u201cWhen you\u2019re dealing with such a large data set, there are some tricky issues around harmful content and language,\" said Kristi Mukk, a coordinator at Harvard's Library Innovation Lab who said the initiative is trying to provide guidance about mitigating the risks of using the data, to \u201chelp them make their own informed decisions and use AI responsibly.\u201d",

      "\u201cAI is the greatest equalizer of people the world has ever created,\u201d Huang said, kicking off one of Europe\u2019s biggest technology industry fairs.",

      "In France, the company is deploying 18,000 of its new Blackwell chips with startup Mistral AI. In Germany, it\u2019s building an industrial AI cloud to support manufacturers. Similar rollouts are underway in Italy, Spain, Finland and the U.K., including a new AI lab in Britain.",
      "Other announcements include a partnership with AI startup Perplexity to bring sovereign AI models to European publishers and telecoms, a new cloud platform with Mistral AI, and work with BMW and Mercedes-Benz to train AI-powered robots for use in auto plants.",

      "Europe, long praised for its leadership on digital rights, now finds itself at a crossroads.

      "A salvage company plans to lift the luxury yacht Bayesian in late June from the Sicilian seabed where it sank last summer, killing seven people",
      "MILAN -- A salvage company expects to lift the wreck of the luxury Bayesian yacht in late June from the seafloor off Sicily where it sank last summer, killing seven people, according to a recovery plan agreed with Italian maritime and investigating authorities, the TMC salvage company said Wednesday.",
      "Salvage teams in the past week have recovered 17 pieces of suspected Bayesian debris from the sea floor identified using a remote-controlled submersible. They have been transferred to shore in Termini Imerese as part of the investigation.",
      "The British-flagged superyacht sank in August, killing U.K. tech magnate Mike Lynch, his daughter and five others.",
      "Several days before the 56-meter (183-foot) long 473-ton yacht is lifted to the surface, crews will use precision tools to remove the 72-meter mast. After that, the Bayesian will be set upright and then gradually lifted to the surface with eight main steel lifting strops that will be installed under the hull. The whole process is expected to take several days.",
      "Marine salvage experts began the operation in early May to recover the superyacht, which is on the seafloor at a depth of about 49 meters (160 feet.) The operation was temporarily halted after a diver\u2019s death a few days later, and the new recovery plan was approved on Tuesday.",
      "\u201cThe salvage teams will now hopefully be able to make more systematic progress in preparations for the ultimate safe recovery of Bayesian, whilst ensuring the safety of those working on this very complex lifting and recovery operation,\u2019\u2019 said Marcus Cave, a TMC Marine director.",
      "British investigators in an interim report issued last month said that the yacht was knocked over by \u201cextreme wind\u201d and couldn\u2019t recover. The report stated that the Bayesian had chosen the site where it sank as shelter from forecast thunderstorms. Wind speeds exceeded 70 knots (81 mph.) at the time of the sinking at 4:06 a.m. on Aug. 19 and \u201cviolently\u201d knocked the vessel over to a 90-degree angle in under 15 seconds.",
      "Italian authorities are conducting a full criminal investigation.",
      "Billionaire entrepreneur Lynch, 59, and his daughter Hannah, 18, were among the dead when the Bayesian sank. The boat trip was a celebration of Lynch\u2019s acquittal in a fraud case in the U.S. in June. Fifteen people survived the accident.",

      "Satellite photos show emperor penguins in one region of Antarctica declined 22% in the past 15 years",
      "WASHINGTON -- The population of emperor penguins in one part of Antarctica appears to be declining faster than previously thought, according to a new analysis of satellite imagery released Tuesday.",
      "The estimated population of 16 penguin colonies \u2014 visible in satellite photos taken between 2009 and 2024 \u2013 had declined 22% during that period mainly because of climate change that's shrinking the amount of available sea ice. It's unclear whether this drop is seen across the continent, scientists said.",
      "\u201cSea ice is very important for the penguins because they breed on sea ice and forage on sea ice,\u201d said Peter Fretwell with British Antarctic Survey, who helped analyze the data.",
      "Scientists previously estimated that the total emperor penguin population declined about 10% across all of Antarctica over the past decade and a half. The latest survey included a region covering the Antarctic Peninsula, Weddell Sea and Bellingshausen Sea.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s absolutely alarming that the numbers are so much worse than predicted,\u201d said Daniel Zitterbart, a penguin researcher at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, who was not involved in the study.",
      "There are uncertainties in the latest estimate. The analysis relies on a calculation of how densely the penguins are clustered in each area where they're detected in a single satellite photo taken each year.",
      "The colonies studied represent about 30% of the total emperor penguin population, which lives only in Antarctica. The loss of stable sea ice may be affecting the penguins in ways beyond shrinking their breeding grounds.",
      "\u201cMore predators like leopard seals and orcas may be able to come in closer to the colonies if sea ice breaks up earlier in the year,\u201d said Fretwell.",
      "Warming ocean temperatures and changing rainfall patterns may also impact the survival of penguin chicks, he added.",

      "Nicki Townsend is unfazed. Wearing only rubber gloves and an outfit suitable for a yoga class, she approaches with soothing words. \u201cAll right, baby,\" she coos as she deftly drapes a towel over his head, grabs him by the scruff of his neck, scoops up his wounded legs and moves him to a clean cage.",
      "It\u2019s not the way her day typically begins, but there\u2019s nothing routine about rescuing foxes.",
      "\u201cYou can never predict what you\u2019re going to arrive at,\u201d Townsend said.",
      "While not as visible as phone boxes or double-decker buses, the red fox is a fixture in London, a city not known for its wildlife. But living on the streets, alleys and back gardens of a dense urban environment can be rough and when foxes need help, they have their own ambulance service \u2014 and Townsend may be on her way.",
      "The foxes didn't invade London so much as adapt and expand their range inward as the city spread to their habitat in the 1930s and suburbs grew.",
      "But people and the bushy-tailed member of the canine family have not always lived in harmony, and the species has admirers and adversaries.",
      "For everyone enchanted seeing a fox trotting nonchalantly down their street at dusk or basking in a sunny backyard, there are plenty who see them as pests. They poop where they like, tear into garbage and the vixens in heat let out terrifying shrieks in the dead of winter when attracting a mate.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s like Marmite with foxes,\u201d Townsend said, referring to the food spread that is an acquired and divisive taste. \u201cYou either love them or hate them.\u201d",
      "The divide between the two camps led Trevor Williams to found what became The Fox Project nearly 35 years ago.",
      "Once a bass player in the rock group Audience that opened for Led Zeppelin and Pink Floyd, Williams had been active in the campaign to stop fox hunting when he redirected his protection efforts to the city, where foxes were once routinely killed.",
      "\u201cBecause of the myths that have occurred over the years, there\u2019s still a lot of suspicion about what foxes might be,\u201d Williams said. \u201cYou know, they\u2019re going to bite the baby, they\u2019re going to eat the cat, they\u2019re going to run away with your husband.\u201d",
      "The project has since grown from providing information on deterring foxes to rescuing 1,400 a year, including 400 cubs, though only about half survive to be released.",
      "There are estimated to be 15,000 foxes in London. The project covers a swath of south London and its leafy suburbs while other organizations not devoted solely to foxes handle other parts of the city.",
      "While the omnivores survive on small animals, bugs and berries in the wild, they favor easily scavenged leftovers in the city and handouts that make them more dependent on humans.",
      "Their main urban menaces are cars, getting snagged in soccer nets or getting stuck in tight spaces. In their effort to get free, they often get nasty abrasions that can become infected. Many also suffer from mange, a parasitic infestation that leads to all kinds of problems.",
      "Townsend pilots her VW Caddy on city streets, highways and narrow lanes that roll through lush hills, responding to calls about injured or ill foxes or cubs that have lost their mothers.",
      "She's seen a bit of everything since her first humbling call 2 1/2 years ago when the supposedly injured fox bolted.",
      "\u201cIn my inexperience, I chased after him, which is comical because you\u2019re never going to outrun a fox,\u201d she said. \u201cI just remember he ran very fast and I looked silly running after him.\u201d",
      "Despite many challenging situations \u2014 she once managed to rescue a fox that lost its footing atop a fence and ended upside down at eye level with its paw lodged between boards \u2014 she's only been bitten once.",
      "Her van carries the distinctly musky scent of foxes. The odor becomes unpleasant when an anxious passenger in a litter of cubs relieves itself enroute to being delivered to a foster care pen where they will stay until being released in the wild.",
      "\u201cFeel free to open the window,\u201d said Townsend, who is accustomed to the stench. \u201cThis is a stinky job.\"",
      "On a recent day, she was dispatched to meet a heartbroken couple who found a cub with a puncture wound collapsed on their back lawn.",
      "\u201cWe thought he was asleep at first, so we went to go and have a close look because we love them,\" Charlotte English said. \u201cThen he just didn\u2019t move, so we knew something was wrong.\u201d",
      "That cub had to be put to sleep, as did the adult Townsend transferred at the start of her shift.",
      "Cubs that recover are socialized in packs of five until they mature and are then released in a rural location while the adults are freed in the neighborhoods where they were found.",
      "Given a second chance, it's not clear how well the foxes fare, because they are rarely tracked. A 2016 study in the journal Applied Animal Behaviour Science found that rehabilitated foxes were more likely to behave as if they had been displaced when returned to their original territory. They were tracked wandering farther away, potentially exposing them to more traffic and greater stress.",
      "\u201cIt is a gap in the knowledge and there\u2019s an assumption that when you release them, they thrive and I think that that assumption needs to be challenged more,\u201d said Bryony Tolhurst, a University of Brighton honorary research fellow and lead author of the study.",
      "For Townsend, fox deaths are offset by the joy of seeing little ones venture into the unknown or an adult darting into a neighborhood it instantly recognizes.",
      "\u201cSometimes they look back and people like to romanticize that they\u2019re saying \u2018thank you,'\" she said. \"They\u2019re just making sure we\u2019re not chasing after them.\u201d",

      "Financial aid fraud is exploding, thanks to the rise of artificial intelligence",
      "It was an unusual question coming from a police officer. Heather Brady was napping at home in San Francisco on a Sunday afternoon when the officer knocked on her door to ask: Had she applied to Arizona Western College?",
      "She had not, and as the officer suspected, somebody else had applied to Arizona community colleges in her name to scam the government into paying out financial aid money.",
      "When she checked her student loan servicer account, Brady saw the scammers hadn't stopped there. A loan for over $9,000 had been paid out in her name \u2014 but to another person \u2014 for coursework at a California college.",
      "\u201cI just can\u2019t imagine how many people this is happening to that have no idea,\u201d Brady said.",
      "The rise of artificial intelligence and the popularity of online classes have led to an explosion of financial aid fraud. Fake college enrollments have been surging as crime rings deploy \u201cghost students\u201d \u2014 chatbots that join online classrooms and stay just long enough to collect a financial aid check.",
      "In some cases, professors discover almost no one in their class is real. Students get locked out of the classes they need to graduate as bots push courses over their enrollment limits. And victims of identity theft who discover loans fraudulently taken out in their names must go through months of calling colleges, the Federal Student Aid office and loan servicers to try to get the debt erased.",
      "On Friday, the U.S. Education Department introduced a temporary rule requiring students to show colleges a government-issued ID to prove their identity. It will apply only to first-time applicants for federal student aid for the summer term, affecting some 125,000 borrowers. The agency said it is developing more advanced screening for the fall.",
      "\u201cThe rate of fraud through stolen identities has reached a level that imperils the federal student aid program,\u201d the department said in its guidance to colleges.",
      "An Associated Press analysis of fraud reports obtained through a public records request shows California colleges in 2024 reported 1.2 million fraudulent applications, which resulted in 223,000 suspected fake enrollments. Other states are affected by the same problem, but with 116 community colleges, California is a particularly large target.",
      "Criminals stole at least $11.1 million in federal, state and local financial aid from California community colleges last year that could not be recovered, according to the reports.",
      "Colleges typically receive a portion of the loans intended for tuition, with the balance going directly to students for other expenses. Community colleges are targeted in part because their lower tuition means larger percentages of grants and loans go to borrowers.",
      "Scammers frequently use AI chatbots to carry out the fraud, targeting courses that are online and allow students to watch lectures and complete coursework on their own time.",
      "In January, Wayne Chaw started getting emails about a class he never signed up for at De Anza Community College, where he had taken coding classes a decade earlier. Identity thieves had obtained his Social Security number and collected $1,395 in financial aid in his name.",
      "The energy management class required students to submit a homework assignment to prove they were real. But someone wrote submissions impersonating Chaw, likely using a chatbot.",
      "\u201cThis person is typing as me, saying my first and last name. ... It\u2019s very freaky when I saw that,\u201d said Chaw.",
      "The fraud involved a grant, not loans, so Chaw himself did not lose money. He called the Social Security Administration to report the identity theft, but after five hours on hold, he never got through to a person.",
      "As the Trump administration moves to dismantle the Education Department, federal cuts may make it harder to catch criminals and help victims of identity theft. In March, the Trump administration fired more than 300 people from the Federal Student Aid office, and the department\u2019s Office of Inspector General, which investigates fraud, has lost more than 20% of its staff through attrition and retirements since October.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m just nervous that I\u2019m going to be stuck with this,\u201d Brady said. \u201cThe agency is going to be so broken down and disintegrated that I won\u2019t be able to do anything, and I\u2019m just going to be stuck with those $9,000\u201d in loans.",
      "Criminal cases around the country offer a glimpse of the schemes' pervasiveness.",
      "In the past year, investigators indicted a man accused of leading a Texas fraud ring that used stolen identities to pursue $1.5 million in student aid. Another person in Texas pleaded guilty to using the names of prison inmates to apply for over $650,000 in student aid at colleges across the South and Southwest. And a person in New York recently pleaded guilty to a $450,000 student aid scam that lasted a decade.",
      "Brittnee Nelson of Shreveport, Louisiana, was bringing her daughter to day care two years ago when she received a notification that her credit score had dropped 27 points.",
      "Loans had been taken out in her name for colleges in California and Louisiana, she discovered. She canceled one before it was paid out, but it was too late to stop a loan of over $5,000 for Delgado Community College in New Orleans.",
      "Nelson runs her own housecleaning business and didn\u2019t go to college. She already was signed up for identity theft protection and carefully monitored her credit. Still, her debt almost went into collections before the loan was put in forbearance. She recently got the loans taken off her record after two years of effort.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s like if someone came into your house and robbed you,\u201d she said.",
      "The federal government's efforts to verify borrowers' identity could help, she said.",
      "\u201cIf they can make these hurdles a little bit harder and have these verifications more provable, I think that\u2019s really, really, really going to protect people in the long run,\u201d she said.",
      "Delgado spokesperson Barbara Waiters said responsibility for approving loans ultimately lies with federal agencies.",
      "\u201cThis is an unfortunate and serious matter, but it is not the direct or indirect result of Delgado\u2019s internal processes,\u201d Waiters said.",
      "In San Francisco, the loans taken out in Brady's name are in a grace period, but still on the books. That has not been her only challenge. A few months ago, she was laid off from her job and decided to sign up for a class at City College San Francisco to help her career. But all the classes were full.",
      "After a few weeks, Brady finally was able to sign up for a class. The professor apologized for the delay in spots opening up: The college has been struggling with fraudulent applications.",

The lawsuit comes as a biotechnology company seeks the court's approval to buy the struggling firm.",
      "Biological samples, DNA data, health-related traits and medical records are too sensitive to be sold without each person\u2019s express, informed consent, Oregon Attorney General Dan Rayfield said in a news release about the lawsuit. Customers should have the right to control such deeply personal information and it cannot be sold like ordinary property, it said.",
      "23andMe customers use saliva-based DNA testing kits to learn about their ancestry and find long-lost relatives. Founded in 2006, the company also conducted health research and drug development. But it struggled to find a profitable business model since going public in 2021. In March it laid off 40% of its staff and filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the Eastern District of Missouri, raising concerns about the safety of customer data.",
      "Regeneron Pharmaceuticals said last month it aimed to buy the company for $256 million. Regeneron said it would comply with 23andMe\u2019s privacy policies and applicable law. It said it would process all customer personal data in accordance with the consents, privacy policies and statements, terms of service, and notices currently in effect and have security controls in place designed to protect such data.",

      "President Donald Trump\u2019s media company just announced a plan to raise $2.5 billion to buy bitcoin, joining a growing number of so-called \u201cbitcoin treasury companies\u201d as the world\u2019s most popular cryptocurrency hits all-time highs.",
      "The companies buy bitcoin for different reasons: Some hold it as a hedge against inflation or to signal support for the cryptocurrency industry, while some firms have made using debt and stock sales to buy bitcoin their primary business strategy.",
      "\u201cThe world at large has no idea what\u2019s happening and they\u2019re in for a big shock,\u201d Dylan LeClair, an executive at the Japan-based Metaplanet, which recently went from being a budget hotel firm to a bitcoin treasury company, said at a recent crypto conference. \u201cThis is a one-way train, nothing is going to stop this.\u201d",
      "The massive increases in some firms\u2019 stock price may seem to validate LeClair\u2019s bravado, but there are plenty of warnings that a downturn in bitcoin\u2019s prices could lead to large selloffs.",

      "That\u2019s how many bitcoins owned by MicroStrategy \u2013 the undisputed goliath of bitcoin treasury companies.",
      "With nearly 3% of the total bitcoin supply, MicroStrategy owns more bitcoins than every other bitcoin treasury company combined. It also owns more bitcoin than every nation state combined, according to the tracking site bitcointreasuries.net.",
      "Now called Strategy, the software company first started buying bitcoin in 2020 with reserve cash. Now, its software business is a small part of a perpetual bitcoin-buying machine that uses a variety of strategies \u2013 like selling shares or issuing debt \u2013 to keep growing its bitcoin holdings.",
      "That\u2019s how much MicroStrategy\u2019s stock price has increased in the last five years, compared to around 1,000% gain in bitcoin and the 1,500% jump for chipmaker and stock market darling Nvidia during that same period.",
      "The company\u2019s success has boosted the profile of MicroStrategy\u2019s founder and chairman, Michael Saylor, who has visited Trump at Mar-a-Lago and the White House while becoming bitcoin\u2019s enigmatic high priest.",
      "\u201cBitcoin is a swarm of cyber hornets serving the goddess of wisdom, feeding on the fire of truth, exponentially growing ever smarter, faster, and stronger behind a wall of encrypted energy,\u201d Saylor said in a social media post.",
      "Saylor\u2019s success has also spawned many imitators.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s kind of shocking \u2026 that it took someone four years after Michael Saylor started doing it to finally do it and pull the trigger and now it feels like everyone\u2019s pulling the trigger,\u201d said Eric Semler, the chairman of Semler Scientific, a healthcare company that started acquiring bitcoin last year.",
      "That\u2019s the average purchase price of bitcoin for half of the 61 publicly traded bitcoin strategy companies, excluding bitcoin mining companies and bitcoin exchange-traded funds, according to a recent analysis by Standard Chartered.",
      "Geoff Kendrick, the bank\u2019s head of digital assets research, said in the report that restrictions on investors buying bitcoin directly help explain the popularity of bitcoin treasury companies, as their stocks can serve as bitcoin proxies. But as crypto becomes more mainstream, the case for investing in bitcoin treasury companies becomes weaker, Kendrick said.",
      "He added that bitcoin\u2019s volatility could force some newer bitcoin treasury companies to sell their holdings to satisfy their debts if it falls under the purchase price.",
      "\u201cThe question then becomes, how much pain can companies withstand before being forced to sell their BTC?\u201d Kendrick said, referring to the symbol for bitcoin.",

      "The scientist is accused of shipping biological material months ago to staff at a laboratory at the University of Michigan. The FBI, in a court filing, described it as material related to certain worms and requires a government permit.",
      "\u201cThe guidelines for importing biological materials into the U.S. for research purposes are stringent, but clear, and actions like this undermine the legitimate work of other visiting scholars,\u201d said John Nowak, who leads field operations at U.S. Customs and Border Protection.",
      "The scientist was interviewed and arrested Sunday after arriving on a flight from China, where she is pursuing an advanced degree at Huazhong University of Science and Technology in Wuhan. She planned to spend a year completing a project at the University of Michigan.",
      "Her shipments, including an envelope stuffed inside a book, were intercepted last year and earlier this year and opened by authorities, the FBI said.",

      "Nintendo's Switch 2 video-game console is out, and it makes some substantial improvements over its predecessor",
      "WASHINGTON -- I'm cruising around Bowser's Castle with my old pal Toad. It's not exactly relaxing, what with all the lava pits and banana peels and turtle shells littering the road. Add 23 other characters \u2014 is that a cow driving? \u2014 who are trying to get to the finish line first, and it's chaos.",
      "The hectic, high-speed insanity of any race in the new Mario Kart World would have caused the eight-year-old Switch console to wheeze a bit. And that's why we've got the Switch 2 ($449.99), the souped-up sequel to Nintendo's popular home-and-portable hybrid.",
      "It looks prettier, too. The 7.9-inch portable display (up from 6.2 inches) boosts the resolution to 1020p (from 720p), and while the LCD screen isn't quite as sharp as an OLED screen might have been, it's much cleaner than the original recipe Switch. It looks even better when connected to an HDTV since it now supports 4K and HDR.",
      "Nintendo has always stood apart from the technological arms race that fans of Sony\u2019s PlayStation and Microsoft\u2019s Xbox obsess over, insisting that first-rate games don\u2019t necessarily depend on high-powered computer chips. But you could feel the strain in 2023\u2019s The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, with its at-times blurry graphics and sluggish framerate. The Switch 2, with a faster framerate of 120 fps, corrects much of the fuzziness.",
      "That's not to say it comes close to matching the high-definition performance of the PlayStation 5 or the Xbox X/S. If you're expecting the jaw-dropping graphics of, say, Ubisoft's Assassin's Creed Shadows ... well, no.",
      "There is good news for those of us who have gotten weary of the old Switch's dinky 32 gigabytes of internal storage. The Switch 2 multiplies that by eight, for 256 GB. Of course, flashier games take up more space, so if you want more room you'll have to invest in a microSD Express card \u2014 which is a bit pricier than the standard memory card used in most portable devices.",
      "The Switch 2's Joy-Con controllers have undergone some tinkering. As before, you can attach them to the sides of the screen if you're playing on the go. If you're at home, you can attach them to a doohickey that feels more like a traditional joystick. Either way, they're now more firmly connected with magnets, which provide a satisfying snap.",
      "Both the left and right Joy-Cons now include an optical mouse, which you can use by placing the controller on its edge and rolling it around on a table. (Nintendo says you can also use it on your pants, but I prefer using a clipboard on my lap.) It remains to be seen how many Switch 2 games will call for a mouse, but 2K's port of Sid Meier's Civilization VII seems like a good candidate.",
      "And then there's a new button labeled \u201cC\u201d on the right-hand Joy-Con. That calls up GameChat, which lets you start up a conversation with other players \u2014 provided you've all taken the time to register yourselves as friends. (Eventually, you'll also need to subscribe to the Nintendo Switch Online service, but that requirement doesn't kick in until March 31, 2026.) The microphone is built into the Switch 2, though if you want to upgrade to video chat, you'll need to buy a separate Nintendo camera.",
      "Finally, there\u2019s GameShare, which lets you play selected titles with other Switch users even if they don\u2019t own the software.",
      "Nintendo has been emphasizing the new social features in its marketing, though it feels like it's catching up to the competition. The kids I know who play Fortnite or Minecraft on competing consoles seem to have figured out long ago how to chat with their pals. Welcome to the 2010s?",
      "As with any console launch, the driving question is: Does it have the games?",
      "There are just a couple of Switch 2 exclusives out now: Mario Kart World and Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour, a $10 demo package that really should have been free. There are some new-to-Nintendo ports of excellent titles like Split Fiction and Cyberpunk 2077. You can get upgrades of classics like the last two Legend of Zelda adventures. And the Switch 2 is fully backward-compatible, so you can play everything that came out for the Switch as well as a substantial library of older titles.",
      "There\u2019s no other machine that will let you play future installments of beloved franchises like Zelda, Super Mario Bros., Super Smash Bros. and Animal Crossing. None of those have been announced yet, but some marquee names \u2014 Donkey Kong and Kirby \u2014 will star in Switch 2 exclusives later this year.",
      "There\u2019s plenty of competition out there, though, and not just in the TV-connected console market Switch shares with the PlayStation and the Xbox. Nintendo no longer has the portable market to itself, thanks to Valve\u2019s SteamDeck. Some models of that device cost less than the Switch 2, and it already has a huge library of PC games. Meanwhile, Microsoft announced over the weekend that it's teaming up with Asus on the ROG Xbox Ally, a handheld that will be out before Christmas.",
      "Honestly, we\u2019ll probably have a better idea of the Switch\u2019s quality a few years down the line, after developers get a handle on what the new hardware can do. If you\u2019re dying to get back behind the wheel with Mario, Luigi and Princess Peach right now, though, you know what you need to do.",
      "\u2014\u2014",
      "A previous version of this story was corrected to say that the Switch 2 social options can be used without a subscription until March 31, 2026.",

      "Amazon says it will spend $20 billion on two data center complexes in Pennsylvania, including one it is building alongside a nuclear power plant that has drawn federal scrutiny over its arrangement to essentially plug right into the power plant",
      "HARRISBURG, Pa. -- Amazon said Monday that it will spend $20 billion on two data center complexes in Pennsylvania, including one it is building alongside a nuclear power plant that has drawn federal scrutiny over an arrangement to essentially plug right into the power plant.",
      "Kevin Miller, vice president of global data centers at Amazon\u2019s cloud computing subsidiary, Amazon Web Services, told The Associated Press that the company will build another data center complex just north of Philadelphia.",
      "One data center is being built next to northeastern Pennsylvania's Susquehanna nuclear power plant. The other will be in Fairless Hills at a logistics campus, the Keystone Trade Center, on what was once a U.S. Steel mill.",
      "In a statement, Gov. Josh Shapiro called it the largest capital investment in Pennsylvania's history.",
      "The announcements add to the billions of dollars in Big Tech's data center cash already flowing into the state.",
      "Since 2024 started, Amazon has committed to about $10 billion apiece to data center projects in Mississippi, Indiana, Ohio and North Carolina as it ramps up its investment in infrastructure to compete with other tech giants to meet growing demand for artificial intelligence products.",
      "The rapid growth of cloud computing and artificial intelligence has fueled demand for data centers that need power to run servers, storage systems, networking equipment and cooling systems.",
      "The majority owner of the Susquehanna nuclear power plant, Talen Energy, announced last year that it had sold its data center to Amazon for $650 million in a deal to eventually provide 960 megawatts. That's 40% of the output of one of the nation's largest nuclear power plants, or enough to power more than a half-million homes.",
      "However, the arrangement between Talen and Amazon \u2014 called a \u201cbehind the meter\u201d connection \u2014 has been held up by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in the first such case to come before the agency.",
      "It has raised questions over whether diverting power to higher-paying customers will leave enough for others and whether it\u2019s fair to excuse big power users from paying for the grid.",
      "For Big Tech, plugging energy-hungry data centers directly into a power plant can take years off their development timelines and is a much faster route to procuring power than having to connect to the congested electricity grid.",
      "It\u2019s not clear when FERC, which blocked the deal on a procedural grounds, will decide the matter, leaving in limbo regulatory treatment of the deal and others that likely would follow.",
      "Already in Pennsylvania, Microsoft announced a deal with the owner of the shuttered Three Mile Island nuclear power plant to restart the reactor under a 20-year agreement to supply its data centers in four states with energy.",
      "Meanwhile, the owners of what was once Pennsylvania\u2019s biggest coal-fired power plant say they will turn it into a $10 billion natural gas-powered data center campus.",

      "Opening arguments before a judge at the British High Court are scheduled for Monday. The trial could last for three weeks.",
      "Stability, based in London, owns a widely used AI image-making tool that sparked enthusiasm for the instant creation of AI artwork and photorealistic images upon its release in August 2022. OpenAI introduced its surprise hit chatbot ChatGPT three months later.",
      "Seattle-based Getty has argued that the development of the AI image maker, called Stable Diffusion, involved \u201cbrazen infringement\u201d of Getty\u2019s photography collection \u201con a staggering scale.\"",
      "Tech companies have long argued that \u201cfair use\u201d or \u201cfair dealing\u201d legal doctrines in the United States and United Kingdom allow them to train their AI systems on large troves of writings or images. Getty was among the first to challenge those practices when it filed copyright infringement lawsuits in the United States and the United Kingdom in early 2023.",
      "\u201cWhat Stability did was inappropriate,\u201d Getty CEO Craig Peters told The Associated Press in 2023. He said creators of intellectual property should be asked for permission before their works are fed into AI systems rather than having to participate in an \u201copt-out regime.\"",
      "Stability has argued that the case doesn't belong in the United Kingdom because the training of the AI model technically happened elsewhere, on computers run by U.S. tech giant Amazon.",
      "Similar cases in the U.S. have not yet gone to trial.",
      "Stable Diffusion\u2019s roots trace to Germany, where computer scientists at Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich worked with the New York-based tech company Runway to develop the original algorithms. The university researchers credited Stability AI for providing the servers that trained the models, which require large amounts of computing power.",

      "After stumbling out of the starting gate in Big Tech\u2019s pivotal race to capitalize on artificial intelligence, Apple tried to regain its footing Monday during a developers conference that focused mostly on incremental advances and cosmetic changes in it...",
      "CUPERTINO, Calif. -- After stumbling out of the starting gate in Big Tech\u2019s pivotal race to capitalize on artificial intelligence, Apple tried to regain its footing Monday during an annual developers conference that focused mostly on incremental advances and cosmetic changes in its technology.",
      "The presummer rite, which attracted thousands of developers from nearly 60 countries to Apple's Silicon Valley headquarters, subdued compared with the feverish anticipation that surrounded the event in the last two years.",
      "Apple highlighted plans for more AI tools designed to simplify people's lives and make its products even more intuitive. It also provided an early glimpse at the biggest redesign of its iPhone software in a decade. In doing so, Apple executives refrained from issuing bold promises of breakthroughs that punctuated recent conferences, prompting CFRA analyst Angelo Zino to deride the event as a \u201cdud\u201d in a research note.",
      "In 2023, Apple unveiled a mixed-reality headset that has been little more than a niche product, and last year WWDC trumpeted its first major foray into the AI craze with an array of new features highlighted by the promise of a smarter and more versatile version of its virtual assistant, Siri \u2014 a goal that has yet to be realized.",
      "\u201cThis work needed more time to reach our high-quality bar,\u201d Craig Federighi, Apple\u2019s top software executive, said Monday at the outset of the conference. The company didn't provide a precise timetable for when Siri's AI upgrade will be finished but indicated it won't happen until next year at the earliest.",
      "\"The silence surrounding Siri was deafening,\" said Forrester Research analyst Dipanjan Chatterjee said. \u201cNo amount of text corrections or cute emojis can fill the yawning void of an intuitive, interactive AI experience that we know Siri will be capable of when ready. We just don\u2019t know when that will happen. The end of the Siri runway is coming up fast, and Apple needs to lift off.\u201d",
      "The showcase unfolded amid nagging questions about whether Apple has lost some of the mystique and innovative drive that has made it a tech trendsetter during its nearly 50-year history.",
      "Instead of making a big splash as it did with the Vision Pro headset and its AI suite, Apple took a mostly low-key approach that emphasized its effort to spruce up the look of its software with a new design called \u201cLiquid Glass\" while also unveiling a new hub for its video games and new features like a \u201cWorkout Buddy\u201d to help manage physical fitness.",
      "Apple executives promised to make its software more compatible with the increasingly sophisticated computer chips that have been powering its products while also making it easier to toggle between the iPhone, iPad, and Mac.",
      "\u201cOur product experience has become even more seamless and enjoyable,\u201d Apple CEO Tim Cook told the crowd as the 90-minute showcase wrapped up.",
      "IDC analyst Francisco Jeronimo said Apple seemed to be largely using Monday's conference to demonstrate the company still has a blueprint for success in AI, even if it's going to take longer to realize the vision that was presented a year ago.",
      "\u201cThis year\u2019s event was not about disruptive innovation, but rather careful calibration, platform refinement and developer enablement \u2014positioning itself for future moves rather than unveiling game-changing technologies,\u201d Jeronimo said.",
      "Besides redesigning its software. Apple will switch to a method that automakers have used to telegraph their latest car models by linking them to the year after they first arrive at dealerships. That means the next version of the iPhone operating system due out this autumn will be known as iOS 26 instead of iOS 19 \u2014 as it would be under the previous naming approach that has been used since the device's 2007 debut.",
      "The iOS 26 upgrade is expected to be released in September around the same time Apple traditionally rolls out the next iPhone models.",
      "Apple opened the proceedings with a short video clip featuring Federighi speeding around a track in a Formula 1 race car. Although it was meant to promote the June 27 release of the Apple film, \u201cF1\u201d starring Brad Pitt, the segment could also be viewed as an unintentional analogy to the company's attempt to catch up to the rest of the pack in AI technology.",
      "While some of the new AI tricks compatible with the latest iPhones began rolling out late last year as part of free software updates, the delays in a souped-up Siri became so glaring that the chastened company stopped promoting it in its marketing campaigns earlier this year.",
      "While Apple has been struggling to make AI that meets its standards, the gap separating it from other tech powerhouses is widening. Google keeps packing more AI into its Pixel smartphone lineup while introducing more of the technology into its search engine to dramatically change the way it works. Samsung, Apple's biggest smartphone rival, is also leaning heavily into AI. Meanwhile, ChatGPT recently struck a deal that will bring former Apple design guru Jony Ive into the fold to work on a new device expected to compete against the iPhone.",
      "Besides grappling with innovation challenges, Apple also faces regulatory threats that could siphon away billions of dollars in revenue that help finance its research and development. A federal judge is currently weighing whether proposed countermeasures to Google's illegal monopoly in search should include a ban on long-running deals worth $20 billion annually to Apple while another federal judge recently banned the company from collecting commissions on in-app transactions processed outside its once-exclusive payment system.",
      "On top of all that, Apple has been caught in the crosshairs of President Donald Trump's trade war with China, a key manufacturing hub for the Cupertino, California, company. Cook successfully persuaded Trump to exempt the iPhone from tariffs during the president's first administration, but he has had less success during Trump's second term, which seems more determined to prod Apple to make its products in the U.S.",
      "The multidimensional gauntlet facing Apple is spooking investors, causing the company's stock price to plunge by 20% so far this year \u2014 a decline that has erased about $750 billion in shareholder wealth. After beginning the year as the most valuable company in the world, Apple now ranks third behind longtime rival Microsoft, another AI leader, and AI chipmaker Nvidia.",
      "Apple's shares closed down by more than 1% on Monday \u2014 an early indication the company's latest announcements didn't inspire investors.",

      "The crashes, which began late last year and carried into 2025, were the tipoff to a sophisticated cyberattack that may have allowed hackers to infiltrate a phone without a single click from the user.",
      "The attackers left no clues about their identities, but investigators at the cybersecurity firm iVerify noticed that the victims all had something in common: They worked in fields of interest to China's government and had been targeted by Chinese hackers in the past.",
      "Foreign hackers have increasingly identified smartphones, other mobile devices and the apps they use as a weak link in U.S. cyberdefenses. Groups linked to China's military and intelligence service have targeted the smartphones of prominent Americans and burrowed deep into telecommunication networks, according to national security and tech experts.",
      "It shows how vulnerable mobile devices and apps are and the risk that security failures could expose sensitive information or leave American interests open to cyberattack, those experts say.",

      "U.S. intelligence officials have said China poses a significant, persistent threat to U.S. economic and political interests, and it has harnessed the tools of digital conflict: online propaganda and disinformation, artificial intelligence and cyber surveillance and espionage designed to deliver a significant advantage in any military conflict.",
      "Mobile networks are a top concern. The U.S. and many of its closest allies have banned Chinese telecom companies from their networks. Other countries, including Germany, are phasing out Chinese involvement because of security concerns. But Chinese tech firms remain a big part of the systems in many nations, giving state-controlled companies a global footprint they could exploit for cyberattacks, experts say.",

      "Mobile devices can buy stocks, launch drones and run power plants. Their proliferation has often outpaced their security.",
      "The phones of top government officials are especially valuable, containing sensitive government information, passwords and an insider's glimpse into policy discussions and decision-making.",

      "While most smartphones and tablets come with robust security, apps and connected devices often lack these protections or the regular software updates needed to stay ahead of new threats. That makes every fitness tracker, baby monitor or smart appliance another potential foothold for hackers looking to penetrate networks, retrieve information or infect systems with malware.",
      "Federal officials launched a program this year creating a \u201ccyber trust mark\u201d for connected devices that meet federal security standards.

    "summary": "The Army is reviewing why pro-Trump merchandise was sold at Fort Bragg this week at an event orchestrated by the White House and supporters of President Donald Trump.",
    "story": [
      "An Army official said images of troops booing Democrats was regrettable.",
      "The Army is reviewing how pro-President Donald Trump merchandise wound up being sold on one of its bases this week at a service-sponsored event orchestrated by the White House and the president's supporters.",
      "Earlier this week, Trump spoke at Fort Bragg in North Carolina in celebration of the Army's 250th birthday. At the event, a truck was spotted selling Trump merchandise -- including \"Make America Great Again\" hats and other \"America First\" swag. The practice is likely at odds with long-standing Defense Department policy, which prohibits troops from wearing political garb such as hats or flags or expressing their political opinion while in uniform.",
      "The policy is intended to preserve America's tradition of apolitical military forces, serving at the behest of a democratically elected president regardless of party.",
      "When asked about pictures of troops in uniform buying Trump merch on a military base, a spokesperson for the base said the matter was under review.",
      "\"The Army remains committed to its core values and apolitical service to the nation,\" said Col. Mary Ricks, a spokesperson for the XVIII Airborne Corps and Fort Bragg.",
      "\"The Army does not endorse political merchandise or the views it represents,\" Ricks added. \"The vendor's presence is under review to determine how it was permitted and to prevent similar occurrences in the future.\"",
      "The public event at Fort Bragg, which is home to the Army's 82nd Airborne Division and serves as the headquarters of the U.S. Army Special Operations Command, was orchestrated much like a Trump campaign rally.",
      "Trump spoke for nearly an hour, repeating false claims of a \"rigged and stolen election\" and bashing his political rivals. He referred to Los Angeles as a \"trash heap\" in the grip of \"transnational gangs and criminals\" -- a reference to the ongoing protests in the city. He said immigration protestors were part of a \"foreign invasion,\" an assessment at odds with his top military adviser, Gen. Dan Caine, who publicly contradicted that statement in testimony.",
      "Sources say organizers of the event placed soldiers who volunteered to attend directly behind the president as he aired his political grievances. Some of the troops nodded and cheered at Trump's suggestion of putting people in jail for burning the American flag and some jeered when he mentioned the \"fake press.\"",
      "Several of the soldiers booed at Trump's references to California Gov. Gavin Newsom and Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass.",
      "\"In Los Angeles, the governor of California, the mayor of Los Angeles, they're incompetent and they paid troublemakers, agitators and insurrectionists,\" he said of the protests in Los Angeles. \"They're engaged in this willful attempt to nullify federal law and aid the occupation of the city by criminal invaders.\"",
      "In hindsight, one Army official said, uniformed officials on the ground probably should have pushed back more on the political nature of the event. Two weeks prior, the president had turned a commencement ceremony at West Point into a politically charged speech in which he also advised cadets to avoid \"trophy wives.\"",
      "\"But what can you do? To you, he's the president. To us, he's the commander-in-chief,\" the official said, a reference to the president's democratically appointed role in commanding the nation's fighting forces.",
      "Sources say civilians from the federal commission America 250 -- many of them with close ties to the White House -- were given \"full creative control\" of the Fort Bragg event. America 250 and the White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "According to two people familiar with the planning effort, the organizers told Army officials on base ahead of the rally that they wanted a certain number of soldiers eager to stand behind the president. These troops would have to undergo a criminal background check for security reasons. Also required, according to sources, -- the troops would need to look fit, not fat, in keeping with the new administration's focus on fitness standards, warrior ethos and lethality.",
      "The troops would have to agree to behave professionally and respectfully, sources said. No eyerolling, for example, or reacting negatively during Trump's speech.",
      "Army officials from the base worked diligently with America 250 organizers to find troops that would fit the bill.",
      "\"We're soldiers,\" one person said. \"We do what we're told.\"",
      "As it turned out, finding troops on base willing to be respectful of Trump wasn't hard, sources said. Trump tends to be popular at Fort Bragg among many of the rank-and-file there. And because the event was voluntary, the spectacle attracted his most ardent supporters.",
      "In the end, footage of troops booing and cheering a political speech while being offered MAGA merch was regrettable, said the Army official.",
      "\"We wish it hadn't happened,\" the official said. \"The Army would like to focus on the history and the celebration of its 250th anniversary and its commitment to defend the nation.\"",

      "The governors slammed Trump's decision to deploy troops to Los Angeles, with Hochul saying it \"undermines sovereignty.\"",
      "\"It's basically saying the highly training individuals \u2026 can't handle their jobs,\" Hochul said, adding it's an \"overreach of epic proportions.\"",
      "Pritzker added that the decision goes against typical protocol, which \"tends to have an inflaming effect.\"",
      "The hearing kicked off with a fiery statement from Ranking Member Stephen Lynch attacking Trump and his administration for their immigration policies. Referencing the Los Angeles protests, Lynch said deploying the military against civilians is \"wrong.\"",
      "\"If we don't step up, it will continue. If we don't step up, other citizens will meet the same fate,\" the Massachusetts Democrat said.",
      "During the hearing, House Republicans have slammed the governors, citing examples where illegal immigrants committed crimes in their states and the governors didn't assist in effectively removing them.",
      "Sanctuary states still enforce U.S. federal immigration laws, but the term often refers to a limited collaboration with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement while enacting policies that are more favorable to undocumented people.",
      "The governors have fired back, saying immigration in the country is managed by the federal government.",
      "House Oversight Chair James Comer requested in April that these Democratic governors testify, claiming that the \"Trump administration is taking decisive action to deport criminal illegal aliens from our nation, but reckless sanctuary states like Illinois, Minnesota, and New York are actively seeking to obstruct federal immigration enforcement.\"",
      "\"The governors of these states must explain why they are prioritizing the protection of criminal illegal aliens over the safety of U.S. citizens, and they must be held accountable,\" Comer said in a media advisory for the upcoming hearing.",
      "A spokesperson for the Democratic Governors Association suggested that the Democratic leaders of these states are focused on governing rather than spending time on \"political stunts.\"",
      "\"While Republicans in D.C. spend their time pulling political stunts, Democratic governors are busy getting real things done for their states, lowering costs, and keeping people safe,\" Johanna Warshaw, a spokesperson for the group, said in a statement.",
      "In March, the Oversight Committee held another newsy hearing with \"sanctuary city\" mayors including Boston Mayor Michelle Wu, Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson, Denver Mayor Mike Johnston and New York City Mayor Eric Adams. Those leaders defended their actions on immigration enforcement while Republicans on the committee accused them of increasing crime by defying Trump administration immigration policies.",

      "In an emailed statement through his PAC, Leaders We Deserve, Hogg says he is stepping down to fully focus on his group's mission to endorse and support aligned candidates in Democratic primaries, a desire at the center of much of the drama between Hogg and senior DNC leaders, including chair Ken Martin.",
      "Hogg said that there is \"a clear fundamental disagreement\" between himself and the party apparatus about the role of vice chair.",
      "\"I came into this role to play a positive role in creating the change our party needs. It is clear that there is a fundamental disagreement about the role of a Vice Chair -- and it's okay to have disagreements,\" Hogg wrote.",
      "\"What isn't okay is allowing this to remain our focus when there is so much more we need to be focused on. Ultimately, I have decided to not run in this upcoming election so the party can focus on what really matters. I need to do this work with Leaders We Deserve, and it is going to remain my number one mission to build the strongest party possible,\" he added.",
      "Hogg went on to write he has respect for his fellow officers, despite disagreements. His fellow vice chair, Malcolm Kenyatta, made no secret of his frustrations with Hogg over the last few weeks.",
      "\"I have nothing but admiration and respect for my fellow officers. Even though we have disagreements, we all are here to build the strongest party possible,\" Hogg wrote.",
      "In response to Hogg stepping down, DNC chair Martin lauded his record and wished him well despite the escalating tensions.",
      "\"I commend David for his years of activism, organizing, and fighting for his generation, and while I continue to believe he is a powerful voice for this party, I respect his decision to step back from his post as Vice Chair,\" Martin said in a statement to ABC News. \"I have no doubt that he will remain an important advocate for Democrats across the map. I appreciate his service as an officer, his hard work, and his dedication to the party,\" he said.",
      "It appeared the DNC re-do election was still on track, just without Hogg on the ticket. Many other details remain unclear, namely if Kenyatta now automatically wins the candidate ballot since he is now unopposed.",

      "Dozens of mayors from across the Los Angeles region banded together to demand that the Trump administration stop the stepped-up immigration raids that have spread fear across their cities and sparked protests across the U.S. They also called on Preside...",
      "LOS ANGELES -- Dozens of mayors from across the Los Angeles region banded together Wednesday to demand that the Trump administration stop the stepped-up immigration raids that have spread fear across their cities and sparked protests across the U.S.",
      "But there were no signs President Donald Trump would heed their pleas.",
      "About 500 of the National Guard troops deployed to the Los Angeles protests have been trained to accompany agents on immigration operations, the commander in charge said Wednesday. And while some troops have already gone on such missions, he said it\u2019s too early to say if that will continue even after the protests die down.",
      "\u201cWe are expecting a ramp-up,\u201d said Maj. Gen. Scott Sherman, noting that protests across the nation were being discussed. \u201cI\u2019m focused right here in LA, what\u2019s going on right here. But you know, I think we\u2019re, we\u2019re very concerned.\u201d",
      "Hours later, a demonstration in Los Angeles\u2019 civic center just before start of the second night of the city\u2019s downtown curfew briefly turned chaotic when police in riot gear \u2014 many on horseback \u2014 charged at a group, striking them with wooden rods and later fired crowd control projectiles, including one that struck a woman who writhed in pain on the ground. After the curfew went into effect, a handful of arrests were made before the area cleared out and the evening quieted down.",
      "The LA-area mayors and city council members urged Trump to stop using armed military troops alongside immigration agents.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m asking you, please listen to me, stop terrorizing our residents,\u201d said Brenda Olmos, vice mayor of Paramount, who said she was hit by rubber bullets over the weekend. \u201cYou need to stop these raids.\u201d",
      "Speaking alongside the other mayors at a news conference, Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass said the raids spread fear at the behest of the White House. The city\u2019s nightly curfew will remain in effect as long as necessary. It covers a 1-square-mile (2.5-square-kilometer) section of downtown where the protests have been concentrated in the city that encompasses roughly 500 square miles (1,295 square kilometers).",
      "\u201cIf there are raids that continue, if there are soldiers marching up and down our streets, I would imagine that the curfew will continue,\u201d Bass said.",
      "Those who have been caught up in the nationwide raids include asylum seekers, people who overstayed their visas and migrants awaiting their day in immigration court.",
      "The administration has cited the protests in its decision to deploy the military.",
      "California's Democratic governor, Gavin Newsom, has asked a federal court to put an emergency stop to the military helping immigration agents in the nation\u2019s second-largest city. This week, guardsmen began standing protectively around agents as they carry out arrests. A judge set a hearing for Thursday.",
      "The Trump administration called the lawsuit a \u201ccrass political stunt endangering American lives\" in its official response on Wednesday.",
      "The military is now closer to engaging in law enforcement actions such as deportations, as Trump has promised in his crackdown. The Guard has the authority to temporarily detain people who attack officers, but any arrests must be made by law enforcement.",
      "The president posted on the Truth Social platform that the city \u201cwould be burning to the ground\u201d if he had not sent in the military.",
      "Some 2,000 National Guard soldiers are in Los Angeles and are soon to be joined by 2,000 more along with about 700 Marines, Sherman said.",
      "Speaking in an interview with The Associated Press and ABC, Sherman initially said National Guard troops had already temporarily detained civilians in the Los Angeles protests over immigration raids. He later said he based his comments on photos and footage he had seen that turned out not to be a representation of Guard members in Los Angeles.",
      "Police detained more than 20 people, mostly on curfew violations, on the first night of the curfew and used crowd-control projectiles to break up hundreds of protesters. But officers were more aggressive in controlling demonstrators Wednesday evening and as the curfew took effect, police were beginning to make arrests.",
      "Los Angeles police have made nearly 400 arrests and detentions since Saturday, the vast majority of which were for failing to leave the area at the request of law enforcement, according to the police department.",
      "There have been a handful of more serious charges, including for assault against police officers and for possession of a Molotov cocktail and a gun. Nine police officers have been hurt, mostly with minor injures. Some were transported to a hospital and released.",
      "Demonstrations have also spread to other cities nationwide, including Dallas and Austin in Texas, and Chicago and New York, where thousands rallied and more arrests were made.",
      "In New York City, police said they took 86 people into custody during protests in lower Manhattan that lasted into Wednesday morning. Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch said the majority of demonstrators were peaceful.",
      "A 66-year-old woman in Chicago was injured when she was struck by a car during downtown protests Tuesday evening, police said. Video showed a car speeding down a street where people were protesting.",
      "In Texas, where police in Austin used chemical irritants to disperse several hundred demonstrators Monday, Republican Gov. Greg Abbott\u2019s office said Texas National Guard troops were \u201con standby\" in areas where demonstrations are planned.",
      "Guard members were sent to San Antonio, but Police Chief William McManus said he had not been told how many troops were deployed or their role ahead of planned protests Wednesday night and Saturday. Officers with the Texas Department of Public Safety said the Texas National Guard was present at a protest downtown.",
      "The protests began Friday after federal immigration raids arrested dozens of workers in Los Angeles.",

      "Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced on Wednesday eight new members to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's independent vaccine advisory committee, some of whom have been critics of shots -- especially during the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "It comes just two days after Kennedy removed all 17 sitting members of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), claiming the panel was plagued by conflicts of interest and was a \"rubber stamp\" for all vaccines.",
      "The ACIP makes recommendations on the safety, efficacy and clinical need of vaccines, and the CDC has the final say on whether or not to accept the recommendations.",
      "Kennedy said in a post on X that the new members include \"highly credentialed scientists, leading public-health experts, and some of America's most accomplished physicians. All of these individuals are committed to evidence-based medicine, gold-standard science, and common sense.\"",
      "The new members will be at an upcoming ACIP meeting scheduled to be held between June 25 and June 27, according to Kennedy. The meeting is to discuss new recommendations for several vaccines, including the HPV vaccine and the COVID-19 vaccine.",
      "\"The committee will review safety and efficacy data for the current schedule as well,\" Kennedy wrote in the post on X.",
      "The new eight members appear to have strong credentials related to medicine, public health, epidemiology and statistics, but with less of an emphasis on credentials related to immunology, virology and vaccinology in comparison with previous committees.",
      "Kennedy told ABC News on Tuesday that the replacements for ACIP would not be \"anti-vaxxers.\" However, some of the new members have previously espoused anti-vaccine sentiments, especially around COVID-19 vaccines and mRNA technology.",
      "One of them, Dr. Robert Malone -- who made some early contributors to mRNA vaccine technology -- spread misinformation during the COVID-19 pandemic, claiming people were \"hypnotized\" into believing mainstream ideas about COVID-19, such as vaccination.",
      "Retsef Levi, another newly appointed member, has previously published non-peer reviewed research alongside Florida Surgeon General Dr. Joseph Ladapo on COVID-19 vaccines, suggesting healthy people have died from the shots.",
      "Another of the new members, Dr. Martin Kulldorff, was a co-author of the Great Barrington Declaration, along with Dr. Jay Bhattacharya, director of the National Institutes of Health.",
      "Published in October 2020 and named after the Massachusetts town in which it was drafted, the Great Barrington Declaration called for COVID-19 lockdowns to be avoided and a new plan for handling the pandemic by protecting the most vulnerable individuals but allowing most to resume normal activities, achieving herd immunity naturally -- a plan criticized as \"unethical\" by Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director-general of the World Health Organization.",
      "At least four of the eight members appear to have been influential to Kennedy\u2019s beliefs. Stat News reported that Malone, Kuldorff and two other new members, Vicky Pebsworth and Dr. Cody Meissner, are all listed in the dedication in the secretary\u2019s book, \u201cThe Real Anthony Fauci,\u201d which attempts to undermine the former health official\u2019s work and questions his motivations before and during the pandemic.",

    "summary": "Senate Judiciary Democrats are pushing for an investigation into Ed Martin's early tenure at the Justice Department.",
    "story": [
      "Ed Martin is the director of the DOJ's \"Weaponization Working Group.\"",
      "Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee are pushing for an investigation into top Justice Department official Ed Martin over his stated plans to \"shame\" political opponents of President Donald Trump who he's unable to charge criminally, as well as a host of other politically charged matters Martin has publicly pledged to pursue in his new position.",
      "\"I write to express my grave concern about Ed Martin\u2019s stated intention to abuse his new roles as lead of the so-called \u201cWeaponization Working Group\u201d you constituted at the Department of Justice (DOJ) and as DOJ\u2019s Pardon Attorney,\" Sen. Dick Durbin, the ranking member of the Judiciary Committee, said in a letter transmitted to the Justice Department, which was first obtained by ABC News. \"Following his disgraceful tenure as Interim U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia, Mr. Martin apparently plans to continue his misconduct in his new roles at DOJ.\"",
      "A DOJ spokesperson confirmed the department received the letter but declined to comment further.",
      "Martin's controversial tenure as the interim U.S. Attorney for Washington, D.C., in the opening months of Trump's presidency thrust the office into turmoil and led several Senate Republicans to state publicly they wouldn't support his permanent confirmation in the role.",
      "But once the White House announced they were pulling Martin's nomination, Trump said Martin would instead be appointed to several top positions working out of DOJ's main headquarters -- serving as an associate deputy attorney general, the U.S. pardon attorney and director of the so-called \"Weaponization Working Group.\"",
      "Martin celebrated the news on his X account, posting 'Eagle Unleashed,' and in various interviews celebrated what he described as a mandate from Trump directly to target the alleged 'weaponization' of the department under the Biden administration.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s classic Donald Trump, right? That somebody tries to block him and block his pick, and he decides to double down,\u201d Martin told Breitbart News last month. \u201cThis is probably the greatest job I could ever envision.\u201d",
      "In a news conference announcing his departure from the D.C. U.S. Attorney's Office, Martin confirmed he planned to launch a probe of last-minute pardons issued by former President Joe Biden just before he left office -- and suggested that officials he's unable to charge would instead be publicly \"shamed.\"",
      "\"There are some really bad actors, some people that did some really bad things to the American people,\" Martin said. \"And if they can be charged, we'll charge them. But if they can't be charged, we will name them ... And in a culture that respects shame, they should be people that are shamed. And that's a fact. That's the way things work. And so that's how I believe the job operates.\"",
      "The approach would directly conflict with longstanding DOJ policy that prohibits prosecutors from naming or disparaging individuals who they don't intend to charge criminally.",
      "When asked about that policy by ABC News during the news conference, Martin said he would \"have to look at what the provision you're referring to, to see -- we want to square ourselves with doing the things correctly.\"",
      "The letter from Senate Democrats said Martin's statements \"are a brazen admission that Mr. Martin plans to systematically violate the Justice Manual\u2019s prohibition on extrajudicial statements by shaming uncharged parties for nakedly partisan reasons. Weaponizing DOJ in this manner will further undermine the public\u2019s trust in the department in irreparable ways.\"",
      "In his early days as pardon attorney, Martin said he advised the president in his pardon of former Virginia county sheriff Scott Jenkins, who had been sentenced to ten years in prison for a federal bribery conviction.",
      "\"No MAGA left behind,\" Martin posted on X in response to the pardon.",
      "Durbin's letter further cited reports Martin has \"personally advocated\" fast-tracking pardons for members of the Proud Boys and Oath Keepers who were convicted of seditious conspiracy stemming from their roles leading up to the attack on the Capitol, after President Trump initially opted to commute their sentences in his sweeping clemency action for the nearly 1600 individuals charged in connection with Jan. 6.",
      "Durbin's letter requests Bondi provide a host of records related to Martin's appointment and early days as head of the Weaponization Working Group and Pardon Attorney's Office. It's unclear whether DOJ will ultimately respond to Durbin's demands given Democrats' minority position on the committee.",

      "After a bruising war between Israel and Hezbollah, Lebanon\u2019s new leaders sense an opportunity to revitalize the country\u2019s devastated economy with help from its wealthy Gulf neighbors",
      "BEIRUT -- Fireworks lit up the night sky over Beirut\u2019s famous St. Georges Hotel as hit songs from the 1960s and 70s filled the air in a courtyard overlooking the Mediterranean Sea.",
      "The retro-themed event was hosted last month by Lebanon\u2019s Tourism Ministry to promote the upcoming summer season and perhaps recapture some of the good vibes from an era viewed as a golden one for the country. In the years before a civil war began in 1975, Lebanon was the go-to destination for wealthy tourists from neighboring Gulf countries seeking beaches in summer, snow-capped mountains in winter and urban nightlife year-round.",
      "In the decade after the war, tourists from Gulf countries \u2013 and crucially, Saudi Arabia \u2013 came back, and so did Lebanon\u2019s economy. But by the early 2000s, as the Iran-backed militant group Hezbollah gained power, Lebanon's relations with Gulf countries began to sour. Tourism gradually dried up, starving its economy of billions of dollars in annual spending.",
      "Now, after last year's bruising war with Israel, Hezbollah is much weaker and Lebanon's new political leaders sense an opportunity to revitalize the economy once again with help from wealthy neighbors. They aim to disarm Hezbollah and rekindle ties with Saudi Arabia and other Gulf countries, which in recent years have prohibited their citizens from visiting Lebanon or importing its products.",
      "\u201cTourism is a big catalyst, and so it\u2019s very important that the bans get lifted,\u201d said Laura Khazen Lahoud, the country's tourism minister.",
      "On the highway leading to the Beirut airport, once-ubiquitous banners touting Hezbollah\u2019s leadership have been replaced with commercial billboards and posters that read \u201ca new era for Lebanon.\u201d In the center of Beirut, and especially in neighborhoods that hope to attract tourists, political posters are coming down, and police and army patrols are on the rise.",
      "There are signs of thawing relations with some Gulf neighbors. The United Arab Emirates and Kuwait have lifted yearslong travel bans.",
      "All eyes are now on Saudi Arabia, a regional political and economic powerhouse, to see if it will follow suit, according to Lahoud and other Lebanese officials. A key sticking point is security, these officials say. Although a ceasefire with Israel has been in place since November, near-daily airstrikes have continued in southern and eastern Lebanon, where Hezbollah over the years had built its political base and powerful military arsenal.",
      "As vital as tourism is \u2014 it accounted for almost 20% of Lebanon's economy before it tanked in 2019 \u2014 the country's leaders say it is just one piece of a larger puzzle they are trying to put back together.",
      "Lebanon\u2019s agricultural and industrial sectors are in shambles, suffering a major blow in 2021, when Saudi Arabia banned their exports after accusing Hezbollah of smuggling drugs into Riyadh. Years of economic dysfunction have left the country's once-thriving middle class in a state of desperation.",
      "The World Bank says poverty nearly tripled in Lebanon over the past decade, affecting close to half its population of nearly 6 million. To make matters worse, inflation is soaring, with the Lebanese pound losing 90% of its value, and many families lost their savings when banks collapsed.",
      "Tourism is seen by Lebanon's leaders as the best way to kickstart the reconciliation needed with Gulf countries -- and only then can they move on to exports and other economic growth opportunities.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the thing that makes most sense, because that\u2019s all Lebanon can sell now,\u201d said Sami Zoughaib, research manager at The Policy Initiative, a Beirut-based think tank.",
      "With summer still weeks away, flights to Lebanon are already packed with expats and locals from countries that overturned their travel bans, and hotels say bookings have been brisk.",
      "At the event hosted last month by the tourism ministry, the owner of the St. Georges Hotel, Fady El-Khoury, beamed. The hotel, owned by his father in its heyday, has acutely felt Lebanon's ups and downs over the decades, closing and reopening multiple times because of wars. \u201cI have a feeling that the country is coming back after 50 years,\u201d he said.",
      "On a recent weekend, as people crammed the beaches of the northern city of Batroun, and jet skis whizzed along the Mediterranean, local business people sounded optimistic that the country was on the right path.",
      "\u201cWe are happy, and everyone here is happy,\u201d said Jad Nasr, co-owner of a private beach club. \u201cAfter years of being boycotted by the Arabs and our brothers in the Gulf, we expect this year for us to always be full.\u201d",
      "Still, tourism is not a panacea for Lebanon's economy, which for decades has suffered from rampant corruption and waste.",
      "Lebanon has been in talks with the International Monetary Fund for years over a recovery plan that would include billions in loans and require the country to combat corruption, restructure its banks, and bring improvements to a range of public services, including electricity and water.",
      "Without those and other reforms, Lebanon's wealthy neighbors will lack confidence to invest there, experts said. A tourism boom alone would serve as a \u201cmorphine shot that would only temporarily ease the pain\" rather than stop the deepening poverty in Lebanon, Zoughaib said.",
      "The tourism minister, Lahoud, agreed, saying a long-term process has only just begun.",
      "\"But we\u2019re talking about subjects we never talked about before,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I think the whole country has realized that war doesn\u2019t serve anyone, and that we really need our economy to be back and flourish again.\u201d",

      "Rangel spent nearly five decades on Capitol Hill and was a founding member of the Congressional Black Caucus.",

      "\u201cHe had the greatest voice in New York politics at the time. It was so rich and so full,\u201d recalled Keogh. \u201cIt just made you feel really warm to be around him and to really hang on every word.\u201d",
      "Tina Marie grew up in Harlem and recalled Rangel as a part of the neighborhood\u2019s famed Gang of Four\u2014 Black Harlemites who rose to the very top of city and state politics in the 1970s through the 1990s.",
      "The others were David Dinkins, New York City\u2019s first Black mayor; Percy Sutton, who was Manhattan Borough president; and Basil Paterson, a deputy mayor and New York secretary of state.",

      "U.S. wholesale prices rose modestly last month from a year earlier, another sign that inflationary pressures remain mild",
      "WASHINGTON -- U.S. wholesale prices rose modestly last month from a year earlier, another sign that inflationary pressures remain mild.",
      "The Labor Department reported Thursday that its producer price index \u2014 which measures inflation before it its consumers \u2014 rose 2.6% in May 2024. Producer prices rose 0.1% from April to May after dropping 0.2% the month before.",
      "Excluding volatile food and energy prices, wholesale costs were up 0.1% from April and 3% from May 2024.",
      "The readings were slightly lower than economists had forecast.",
      "The report came out a day after the Labor Department said that consumer prices rose a modest 0.1% last month from April and 2.4% from a year earlier.",
      "Since returning to the office, Trump has rolled out 10% tariffs on nearly every country in the world as well as specific levies on steel, aluminum and autos. Importers in the United States pay the taxes and pass them along to consumers via higher prices when they can. For that reason, economists expect inflation to pick up later this year.",
      "So far, his tariffs don\u2019t seem to have had much of an impact on prices overall.",
      "Wholesale prices can offer an early look at where consumer inflation might be headed. Economists also watch it because some of its components, notably health care and financial services, flow into the Federal Reserve\u2019s preferred inflation gauge \u2014 the personal consumption expenditures, or PCE, index.",
      "Inflation began to flare up for the first time in decades in 2021, as the economy roared back with unexpected strength from COVID-19 lockdowns. That prompted the Fed to raise its benchmark interest rate 11 times in 2022 and 2023. The higher borrowing costs helped bring inflation down from the peaks it reached in 2022, and last year the Fed felt comfortable enough with the progress to cut rates three times.",
      "But it has turned cautious this year while it waits to see the inflationary impact of Trump\u2019s trade policies. The central bank is expected to leave rates unchanged at its meeting next Tuesday and Wednesday.",

      "UNHCR chief Filippo Grandi nonetheless pointed to some \u201crays of hope\u201d over the last six months, including the return home of nearly 2 million Syrians as their country tries to recover from more than a decade of civil war.",
      "The findings come as the refugee agency released its Global Trends Report on Thursday, which said the number of people driven abroad or displaced in their home countries by war, violence and persecution as of April rose to 122.1 million, up from 120 million a year earlier.",
      "Among those, the numbers of internally displaced people jumped by more than 9% to 73.5 million at the end of last year. The numbers represent cumulative figures from years of conflict, violence and persecution, and some displaced people returned home last year even as others fled.",
      "The report comes at a time when humanitarian groups are facing budget cuts from the United States and other traditional Western donors.",
      "UNHCR said nearly two-thirds of people who crossed national borders to flee remained in neighboring countries, countering the \u201cwidespread perception in wealthier regions\u201d that a majority of people were fleeing in a bid to reach places like Europe or the United States.",

    "story": [
      "The U.N. General Assembly is expected to vote on a resolution demanding an immediate ceasefire in Gaza, the release of all hostages held by Hamas, and the opening of all Israeli border crossings for deliveries of desperately needed food and other aid",
      "UNITED NATIONS -- The U.N. General Assembly is expected to vote Thursday on a resolution demanding an immediate ceasefire in Gaza, the release of all hostages held by Hamas, and the opening of all Israeli border crossings for deliveries of desperately needed food and other aid.",
      "The resolution, drafted by Spain and obtained Wednesday by The Associated Press, \u201cstrongly condemns any use of starvation of civilians as a method of warfare.\u201d",
      "Experts and human rights workers say hunger is widespread in Gaza and some 2 million Palestinians are at risk of famine if Israel does not fully lift its blockade and halt its military campaign, which it renewed in March after ending a ceasefire with Hamas.",
      "Last week, the U.N. Security Council failed to pass a resolution demanding a ceasefire in Gaza and calling on Israel to lift all restrictions on the delivery of aid. The United States vetoed the resolution because it was not linked to the release of the hostages, while all 14 other members of the council voted in favor.",
      "There are no vetoes in the 193-member General Assembly, where the resolution is expected to pass overwhelmingly. But unlike in the Security Council, assembly resolutions are not legally binding, though they are seen as a barometer of world opinion.",
      "After a 10-week blockade that barred all aid to Gaza, Israel is allowing the United Nations to deliver a trickle of food assistance and is backing a newly created U.S. aid group, which has opened several sites in the center and south of the territory to deliver food parcels.",
      "But the aid system rolled out last month by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation has been troubled by near-daily shootings as crowds make their way to aid sites, while the longstanding U.N.-run system has struggled to deliver food because of Israeli restrictions and a breakdown of law and order.",
      "The draft resolution being voted on Thursday references a March 28 legally binding order by the top United Nations court for Israel to open more land crossings into Gaza for food, water, fuel and other supplies. The International Court of Justice issued the order in a case brought by South Africa accusing Israel of acts of genocide in its war in Gaza, charges Israel strongly denies.",
      "The resolution stresses that Israel, as an occupying power, has an obligation under international law to ensure that humanitarian aid reaches those in need.",
      "It reiterates the assembly's commitment to a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, with the Gaza Strip as part of a Palestinian state. The assembly is holding a high-level meeting next week to push for a two-state solution, which Israel has rejected.",
      "The resolution supports mediation efforts by Egypt, Qatar and the United States aimed at implementing a January ceasefire agreement. When the U.S. vetoed last week\u2019s Gaza resolution, acting Ambassador Dorothy Shea said it would have undermined the security of Israel and diplomatic efforts to reach a ceasefire \u201cthat reflects the realities on the ground.\u201d",
      "Like the failed Security Council resolution, the resolution to be voted on Thursday also does not condemn Hamas\u2019 deadly attack in southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, which ignited the war, or say the militant group must disarm and withdraw from Gaza. Both are U.S. demands.",
      "The Hamas-led militants killed around 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and took 251 hostage. About 55 hostages are still being held. Israel\u2019s military campaign has killed over 55,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza\u2019s Health Ministry. It says women and children make up most of the dead, but doesn\u2019t distinguish between civilians and combatants. Israel says it has killed more than 20,000 militants, without providing evidence.",

      "House Democrats are searching for a new leader on the powerful House Oversight Committee after the untimely passing of their previous ranking member",
      "WASHINGTON -- House Democrats are quietly engaged in a behind-the-scenes race for a key committee position, the second time in as many months that the party has had to fill one of the most prized positions in Congress.",
      "Four Democrats are running to be the ranking member on the House Oversight Committee, an investigative panel with public clout, subpoena power and an expansive portfolio. The position is open due to the death last month of Rep. Gerry Connolly of Virginia.",
      "While Democrats in the minority have little power to shape the committee\u2019s work, the ranking member position comes with an enormous platform \u2014 and the possibility of becoming chair if the party wins back the majority in next year's midterm elections.",
      "Whoever wins will immediately be squaring off against Republicans as they prepare for splashy hearings this summer on immigration enforcement, LGBTQ rights and former President Joe Biden\u2019s age and mental condition while in office.",
      "As they hear from the candidates, Democrats are weighing many of the factors that were in play late last year, when Connolly, a veteran member of the committee, fended off a challenge from Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York.",
      "A look at how the race is shaping up:",
      "The debate over Biden\u2019s age coincides with a reckoning over seniority and generational change happening across the Democratic Party.",
      "Four House Democrats are running for the position: Stephen Lynch of Massachusetts, the acting ranking member; Jasmine Crockett of Texas, a viral sensation; Robert Garcia, a former Los Angeles County mayor who has pitched colleagues on a government reform agenda; and Kweisi Mfume of Maryland, former president of the NAACP and civil rights advocate.",
      "While Lynch is the most senior of the four, Democrats broadly said they are more open to breaking from seniority than they were in December, when Connolly, then 74, beat out Ocasio-Cortez, 35, for the job.",
      "Democrats are interested in how the candidates would communicate with the public, how they would help support lawmakers in battleground districts \u2014 and of course, how they would challenge President Donald Trump and his administration.",
      "Crockett, 44, has pitched herself as the candidate best able to compete with Trump\u2019s pugnacious and attention-grabbing style. Democrats, Crockett has argued, often fail to connect with voters and explain why the president\u2019s actions may be harmful. She believes she can.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a matter of bringing that in, having a hearing and making sure that we are translating it and amplifying it,\u201d Crockett told MSNBC in an interview. \u201cCommunications has to be a full-on strategy.\u201d",
      "Garcia, 47, has focused on government reform and effectiveness, a key issue for Democrats after the Trump administration\u2019s blitz across federal agencies and mass firings of federal workers by billionaire Elon Musk\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency.",
      "Mfume, 76, has attracted support from members impressed by his longtime stewardship of the nation\u2019s oldest civil rights group. He returned to Congress after decades leading the NAACP following the death of a previous Democratic Oversight chair, the late Congressman Elijah Cummings, a fellow Baltimore Democrat.",
      "Lynch, 70, has styled himself as the acting chair and the lawmaker best positioned to take on the committee\u2019s chairman, Republican James Comer of Kentucky.",
      "\u201cThere are some members who speak to a very narrow audience, and that\u2019s great,\u201d Lynch said.",
      "\u201cWe want them to be energized and animated. But that same person is not going to go to the Rust Belt with people that are farmers, moderates, conservatives,\u201d Lynch told The Associated Press. \u201cYou need different voices to appeal to different constituencies.\u201d",
      "\u201cI think I have a better chance of bringing back the blue-collar working people, and I have less of a chance of appealing to very younger people who are intensely invested in social media,\u201d Lynch said.",
      "The vote for Oversight ranking member is scheduled for June 24 and will be conducted by secret ballot. All four candidates are speaking before multiple caucuses this week, including the New Democrats and the progressive caucus, the Congressional Black Caucus, the Congressional Hispanic Caucus and the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus.",
      "While many Democrats are undecided, others have made up their mind. Some who are privately stumping for their candidate believe it will be a tight race. That makes the public forums and private pitches even more crucial in the run-up to the vote.",
      "House progressives are divided over their preferred choice. Three members of the Congressional Progressive Caucus \u2014 Crockett, Garcia and Mfume \u2014 are vying for the ranking member seat, which makes it unlikely the caucus will back a single candidate.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re looking for folks that could expose this kind of corruption and hold Trump and his billionaire donors accountable,\u201d said Rep. Greg Casar of Texas, the Progressive Caucus chair.",
      "Rep. Brad Schneider, chair of the centrist New Democrat Coalition, said he\u2019s weighing two factors: which candidate could best help Democrats win the 2026 midterm elections and whether they can successfully lead investigations into the Trump administration and \u201ctry to repair some of the damage that\u2019s been done.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe committee can be a flash point, or it can be a very effective place for us to make our point, and we want to know who\u2019s going to do best in that role to make sure the committee works to help us secure 218 (members) next November,\u201d Schneider said.",
      "Some Democratic caucuses have traditionally prized seniority as a clear and reliable way for lawmakers of color to rise through the ranks. There has never been a Hispanic Oversight chairman and only one Black chairman, Elijah Cummings.",
      "\u201cThe CBC has always stood for seniority,\u201d said Rep. Hank Johnson of Georgia. But Johnson noted that the Black Caucus has at times \u201cdeviated\u201d from that norm. He said many in the caucus are open to a conversation about age.",
      "\u201cSo, Steve Lynch, I think, is the next senior member. And but as I said, other factors have to be considered and I\u2019m sure that, along with myself, other CBC members are going through that process,\u201d Johnson said.",
      "\u201cSince I\u2019ve been here, seniority has had weight,\u201d said Rep. Gregory Meeks of New York, who said he was undecided on which candidate to back. \u201cBut seniority is not the only thing. And there are times and circumstances where the person with the most seniority has not won. Whether that\u2019s one of these times or not is what we\u2019re going to see.\u201d",

Gavin Newsom is calling President Donald Trump's military intervention at protests over federal immigration policy in Los Angeles an assault on democracy and has sued to try to stop it. Meanwhile, Texas Republican Gov. Greg Abbott is putting the National Guard on standby in areas in his state where demonstrations are planned.",
      "The divergent approaches illustrate the ways the two parties are trying to navigate national politics and the role of executive power in enforcing immigration policies.",
      "In his live TV address this week, Newsom said that Trump\u2019s move escalated the situation \u2014 and for political gain.",
      "All 22 other Democratic governors signed a statement sent by the Democratic Governors Association on Sunday backing Newsom, calling the Guard deployment and threats to send in Marines \u201can alarming abuse of power\u201d that \"undermines the mission of our service members, erodes public trust, and shows the Trump administration does not trust local law enforcement.\u201d",
      "The protests in Los Angeles have mostly been contained to five blocks in a small section of downtown; nearly 200 people were detained on Tuesday and at least seven police officers have been injured.",
      "In Republican-controlled states, governors have not said when or how they're planning to deploy military troops for protests.",
      "Since Trump's return to office, Democratic governors have been calculating about when to criticize him, when to emphasize common ground and when to bite their tongues.",
      "The governors' responses are guided partly by a series of political considerations, said Kristoffer Shields, director of the Eagleton Center on the American Governor at Rutgers University: How would criticizing Trump play with Democrats, Republicans and independent voters in their states? And for those with presidential ambitions, how does that message resonate nationally?",
      "Democratic governors are weighing a number of considerations.",
      "\u201cThere probably is some concern about retributions \u2014 what the reaction of the administration could be for a governor who takes a strong stance,\" Shields said.",
      "And in this case, polling indicates about half of U.S. adults approve of how Trump is handling immigration, though that polling was conducted before the recent military deployment.",
      "On other issues, Democratic governors have taken a variety of approaches with Trump.",
      "At a White House meeting in February, Maine Democratic Gov. Janet Mills told Trump, \u201c we\u2019ll see you in court \u201d over his push to cut off funding to the state because it allowed transgender athletes in girls' school sports. Michigan's Gretchen Whitmer, a possible 2028 presidential candidate, publicly sparred with Trump during his first term but this time around, has met with him privately to find common ground.",
      "Initially, Hawaii Gov. Josh Green referred to Trump as a \u201cstraight-up dictator,\" but the next month he told a local outlet that he was treading carefully, saying: \u201cI\u2019m not going to criticize him directly much at all.\"",
      "Apart from their joint statement, some of the highest-profile Democratic governors have not talked publicly about the situation in California. When asked, on Wednesday, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul's office pointed to a Sunday social media post about the joint statement. Whitmer didn't respond.",
      "The office of Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, who is set to testify before Congress on Thursday about his state laws protecting people who are in the country without legal status, reiterated in a statement that he stands with Newsom. The office said \u201clocal authorities should be able to do their jobs without the chaos of this federal interference and intimidation.\u201d",
      "Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, in an interview Wednesday in The Washington Post, said Trump should not send troops to a weekend protest scheduled in Philadelphia.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s injected chaos into the world order, he\u2019s injected it into our economy, he is trying to inject chaos into our streets by doing what he did with the Guard in California,\" Shapiro said.",
      "As state attorney general during Trump\u2019s first term, Shapiro routinely boasted that he sued Trump over 40 times and won each time. As governor he has often treaded more carefully, by bashing Trump\u2019s tariffs, but not necessarily targeting Trump himself.",
      "Florida Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis has often clashed with Newsom, a fellow term-limited governor with national ambitions.",
      "Newsom's office said DeSantis offered to send Florida State Guard troops to California.",
      "\u201cGiven the guard were not needed in the first place, we declined Governor DeSantis attempt to inflame an already chaotic situation made worse by his Party\u2019s leader,\u201d Newsom spokesperson Diana Crofts-Pelayo said in an email to The Associated Press.",
      "Speaking on Fox News on Tuesday, DeSantis said the gesture was a typical offer of mutual aid during a crisis \u2014 and was dismissive of the reasons it was turned down.",
      "\u201cThe way to put the fire out is to make sure you have law and order,\u201d he said.",
      "Protests against immigration enforcement raids have sprung up in other cities \u2014 and a series of \u201cNo Kings\u201d demonstrations are planned for the weekend \u2014 with governors preparing to respond.",
      "In Connecticut, Democratic Gov. Ned Lamont said he has spoken with his public safety commissioner to make sure state and local police work together.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t want to give the president any pretext to think he can come into Connecticut and militarize the situation. That just makes the situation worse,\u201d said Lamont, who called Trump \"a little eager to send federal troops and militarize the situation in Los Angeles.\u201d",
      "It is unclear how many Texas National Guard members will be deployed or how many cities asked for assistance. In Austin, where police used chemical irritants to disperse several hundred protesters on Monday, the mayor\u2019s office said the National Guard was not requested.",
      "San Antonio officials also said they didn\u2019t request the Guard.",
      "Florida's DeSantis said law enforcement in his state is preparing \u201cThe minute you cross into attacking law enforcement, any type of rioting, any type of vandalism, looting, just be prepared to have the law come down on you,\u201d DeSantis said Tuesday. \u201cAnd we will make an example of you, you can guarantee it.\u201d",

      "Oklahoma is preparing to execute a man whose transfer to state custody was expedited by the Trump administration",
      "McALESTER, Okla. -- Oklahoma prepared to execute a man Thursday whose transfer to state custody was expedited by the Trump administration.",
      "John Fitzgerald Hanson, 61, is set to receive a lethal injection at the Oklahoma State Penitentiary in McAlester. Hanson was sentenced to die after he was convicted of carjacking, kidnapping and killing a Tulsa woman in 1999.",
      "Hanson, whose name in some federal court records is George John Hanson, had been serving a life sentence in federal prison in Louisiana for several unrelated federal convictions. Federal officials transferred him to Oklahoma custody in March to follow through on President Donald Trump\u2019s sweeping executive order to more actively support the death penalty.",
      "Hanson's attorneys argued in a last-minute appeal that he did not receive a fair clemency hearing last month, claiming that one of the board members who denied him clemency was biased because he worked for the Tulsa County District Attorney's Office when Hanson was prosecuted. A district court judge this week temporary halted the execution, but an appeals court later cleared the way for it.",
      "The U.S. Supreme Court late Wednesday rejected a separate appeal that alleged a key witness testified against Hanson in exchange for favorable treatment from prosecutors in a criminal case, information that was never disclosed to his defense team.",
      "Prosecutors allege Hanson and accomplice, Victor Miller, kidnapped Mary Bowles from a Tulsa shopping mall. Prosecutors allege the pair drove Bowles to a gravel pit near Owasso, where Miller shot and killed property owner Jerald Thurman. The two then drove Bowles a short distance away, where Hanson shot and killed Bowles, according to prosecutors. Miller received a no-parole life prison sentence for his role in the crimes.",
      "During last month's clemency hearing, Hanson expressed remorse for his involvement in the crimes and apologized to the victims' families.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not an evil person,\u201d Hanson said via a video link from the prison. \u201cI was caught in a situation I couldn\u2019t control. I can\u2019t change the past, but I would if I could.\u201d",
      "Hanson\u2019s attorneys acknowledged he participated in the kidnapping and carjacking, but said there was no definitive evidence that he shot and killed Bowles. They painted Hanson as a troubled youth with autism and who was controlled and manipulated by the domineering Miller.",

      "SAN FRANCISCO -- A federal court hearing is scheduled for Thursday on whether the Trump administration can use the National Guard and Marines to assist with immigration raids in Los Angeles.",
      "California Gov. Newsom has depicted the federal military intervention in the nation's second largest city as the onset of a much broader effort by Trump to overturn political and cultural norms at the heart of the nation\u2019s democracy. Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass has echoed that, saying the deployment of troops was unnecessary and meant to undermine local jurisdictions and intimidate the city\u2019s large immigrant population.",
      "Newsom filed an emergency motion requesting the court's intervention after President Donald Trump ordered the deployment of roughly 4,000 National Guard members and 700 Marines to Los Angeles following protests over his stepped-up enforcement of immigration laws.",
      "The Trump administration called the lawsuit a \u201ccrass political stunt endangering American lives\u201d in its official response on Wednesday.",
      "The Democratic governor argued the troops were originally deployed to protect federal buildings and said sending troops to help support immigration raids would only promote civil unrest.",
      "The protests over immigration raids in Los Angeles intensified after Trump called up the National Guard and have since spread to other cities, including Boston, Chicago and Seattle.",
      "Federal immigration agents have been arresting people at Home Depot parking lots and other businesses, sparking fear in immigrant communities, after the Trump administration said it wanted to dramatically increase arrests under its immigration crackdown.",
      "Trump has described Los Angeles in dire terms that Bass and Newsom say are nowhere close to the truth.",
      "Most demonstrations have been peaceful but this weekend some turned raucous with protesters setting cars on fire in downtown Los Angeles. The city has imposed a nightly curfew covering a 1-square-mile (2.5-square-kilometer) section where protests have occurred in the sprawling metropolis of 4 million people.",
      "The Marines have not yet been spotted in Los Angeles and Guard troops have had limited engagement with protesters.",
      "Newsom filed the motion Tuesday, the same day the military announced some members of the National Guard were now standing in protection around federal agents. The change moves troops closer to engaging in law enforcement actions like deportations as Trump has promised as part of his administration\u2019s immigration crackdown. The Guard has the authority to temporarily detain people who attack officers but any arrests ultimately would be made by law enforcement.",
      "Senior U.S. District Judge Charles R. Breyer chose not to rule immediately but set the hearing for Thursday in federal court in San Francisco.",
      "Dozens of mayors from across the Los Angeles region banded together Wednesday to demand the raids stop and the troops leave.",

      "McALLEN, Texas -- Immigration advocates filed a class action lawsuit Wednesday over the Trump administration's use of a proclamation that effectively put an end to being able to seek asylum at ports of entry to the United States.",
      "The civil lawsuit was filed in a Southern California federal court by the Center for Gender & Refugee Studies, the American Immigration Council, Democracy Forward, and the Center for Constitutional Rights.",
      "The lawsuit is asking the court to find the proclamation unlawful, set aside the policy ending asylum at ports of entry and restore access to the asylum process at ports of entry, including for those who had appointments that were canceled when President Donald Trump took office.",
      "Unlike a similar lawsuit filed in February in a Washington, D.C., federal court representing people who had already reached U.S. soil and sought asylum after crossing between ports of entry, Wednesday's lawsuit focuses on people who are not on U.S. soil and are seeking asylum at ports of entry.",
      "No response was immediately issued by the Department of Homeland Security or Customs and Border Protection, which were both among the defendants listed.",
      "Trump's sweeping proclamation issued on his first day in office changed asylum policies, effectively ending asylum at the border. The proclamation said the screening process created by Congress under the Immigration and Nationality Act \u201ccan be wholly ineffective in the border environment\u201d and was \u201cleading to the unauthorized entry of innumerable illegal aliens into the United States.\u201d",
      "Immigrant advocates said that under the proclamation noncitizens seeking asylum at a port of entry are asked to present medical and criminal histories, a requirement for the visa process but not for migrants who are often fleeing from immediate danger.",

      "NEW YORK -- Harvey Weinstein has been found guilty again, convicted Wednesday of a top sex crimes charge at his #MeToo retrial in New York City. The mixed and partial verdict came more than five years after his first conviction, which an appeals court overturned last year.",
      "The jury returned a verdict on two of three charges against Weinstein, acquitting him of one. Jurors indicated that they had yet to achieve unanimity on the final count. That could mean more deliberations on Thursday.",
      "The verdict capped an extraordinary fifth day of deliberations.",
      "The jury foreperson complained that he was being bullied by other jurors. Weinstein\u2019s lawyer then asked for a mistrial, and Weinstein himself addressed the judge without jurors in the courtroom, imploring him to end the case without a verdict.",
      "Minutes later, the jury of seven women and five men declared the ailing 73-year-old guilty of one count of criminal sex act, which carries a maximum sentence of 25 years in prison. Weinstein denies raping or sexually assaulting anyone. Once he\u2019s sentenced, he can appeal.",
      "Here\u2019s what you need to know about the verdict:",
      "Jurors convicted Weinstein of one count of criminal sex act, finding that he forcibly performed oral sex on a TV and movie producer and production assistant, Miriam Haley, nearly two decades ago.",
      "Haley, who had a short stint working on the Weinstein-produced \u201cProject Runway,\u201d testified that he assaulted her in July 2006 after inviting her to stop by his SoHo apartment before a flight his company booked her on the next day to Los Angeles to attend a movie premiere.",
      "Haley testified that Weinstein backed her into a bedroom, pushed her onto a bed and forced oral sex on her, undeterred by her kicks and pleas of, \u201cNo, no \u2014 it\u2019s not going to happen.\u201d",
      "Weinstein was convicted of the same charge at his first trial.",
      "Haley, who has also gone by the name Mimi Haleyi, told jurors that she was never interested in any sexual or romantic relationship with Weinstein but still wanted his help professionally.",
      "She acknowledged she kept in touch and exchanged warm messages with him and accepted an invitation to his hotel room two weeks after the alleged assault, when she said he pulled her into bed for sex.",
      "Weinstein acquitted of a charge of criminal sex act relating to a previously uncharged allegation that he forced oral sex on Kaja (KEYE\u2019-ah) Sokola, a psychologist and former Polish model and actor, at a Manhattan hotel in 2006 just before her 20th birthday.",
      "Sokola, who wasn\u2019t a part of Weinstein\u2019s first trial, testified that Weinstein assaulted her after luring her to his hotel room by telling her had a script to show her. As he pushed her onto a bed, stripped off her boots, her stockings and her underwear, \u201cmy soul was removed from me,\" she said.",
      "Now 39, Sokola said he held her down while ignoring her pleas of \u201cplease don\u2019t, please stop, I don\u2019t want this.\u201d She said she tried to push him away but was no match against the much larger Weinstein.",
      "Sokola also testified that Weinstein sexually assaulted her when she was 16 years old, but that allegation was beyond legal time limits for a potential criminal charge.",
      "Sokola said she stayed in touch with Weinstein because she had dreams of an acting career.",
      "She went to authorities in January 2020, a few days into Weinstein\u2019s first trial. Prosecutors halted their investigation after Weinstein was convicted, but revived it when the verdict was thrown out last year.",
      "The jury hasn't reached a verdict on a third-degree rape charge involving Jessica Mann\u2019s allegation that Weinstein assaulted her in March 2013.",
      "Mann, a cosmetologist and hairstylist, said she met Weinstein at a party in late 2012 or early 2013, when she was 27 and trying to launch an acting career.",
      "She alleges Weinstein trapped her in a Manhattan hotel room, demanded that she undress as he loomed over her, grabbed her arms and raped her after, she believes, he injected himself with an erection-promoting drug that she later found in the bathroom trash.",
      "Mann said she had a consensual, on-and-off relationship with the then-married Weinstein, but that he was volatile and violated her if she refused him.",
      "She said she kept in touch with Weinstein after the alleged rape, telling jurors she \u201ccompartmentalized the part of Harvey that was hurting me,\u201d and that flattery and friendliness \u201ckept the peace.\u201d",
      "The Associated Press generally does not name sexual assault accusers without their permission, which Haley, Mann and Sokola have given.",
      "New York\u2019s highest court, the Court of Appeals, threw out Weinstein\u2019s conviction in April 2024.",
      "In a 4-3 decision, the court said the judge in the first trial, James Burke, denied Weinstein a fair trial by letting three women testify about allegations that didn't result in charges and by deciding that prosecutors could confront Weinstein, if he testified, about stories of him behaving brutishly.",
      "The court labeled the allegations against Weinstein \u201cappalling, shameful, repulsive conduct\u201d but warned that \u201cdestroying a defendant\u2019s character under the guise of prosecutorial need\u201d did not justify some trial evidence and testimony.",
      "Burke\u2019s term expired at the end of 2022, and he is no longer a judge.",
      "Prosecutors were not allowed to retry Weinstein on charges that he was acquitted of during his first trial, including predatory sexual assault and one count of first-degree rape.",
      "Weinstein is appealing his conviction in Los Angeles in a similar case in 2022.",
      "Jurors there found him guilty of three of seven charges, including rape, and he was sentenced to 16 years in prison. Weinstein\u2019s lawyers argued he did not get a fair trial.",
      "They contend that the judge in the California case wrongly allowed jurors to know about Weinstein\u2019s 2020 New York conviction, and that the jury was unfairly prejudiced by testimony from women about alleged assaults Weinstein was not charged with.",

      "According to the White House official, Trump is expected to sign resolutions that block California\u2019s rule phasing out gas-powered cars and ending the sale of new ones by 2035. He will also kill rules that phase out the sale of medium- and heavy-duty diesel vehicles and cut tailpipe emissions from trucks.",

      "All 12 members of the board overseeing the prestigious Fulbright scholarships on Wednesday resigned in protest of what they call the Trump administration\u2019s meddling with the selection of award recipients, according to a statement they issued",
      "All 12 members of the board overseeing the prestigious Fulbright scholarships on Wednesday resigned in protest of what they call the Trump administration\u2019s meddling with the selection of award recipients, according to a statement.",
      "A statement published online by the board members said the administration usurped the board\u2019s authority by denying awards to \u201ca substantial number of people\u201d who already had been chosen. Another 1,200 award recipients who were already approved to come to the U.S. are undergoing an unauthorized review process that could lead to their rejection, the board members said.",
      "\u201cTo continue to serve after the Administration has consistently ignored the Board\u2019s request that they follow the law would risk legitimizing actions we believe are unlawful and damage the integrity of this storied program and America\u2019s credibility abroad,\u201d the statement reads.",
      "Congress established the Fulbright program nearly 80 years ago to promote international exchange and American diplomacy. The highly selective program awards about 9,000 scholarships annually in the U.S. and in more than 160 other countries to students, scholars, and professionals in a range of fields.",
      "A message seeking comment was left with the State Department, which runs the scholarship program.",
      "The resignations were first reported by The New York Times.",
      "The intervention from the Trump administration undermined the program's merit-based selection process and its insulation from political influence, the board members wrote.",
      "\u201cWe believe these actions not only contradict the statute but are antithetical to the Fulbright mission and the values, including free speech and academic freedom, that Congress specified in the statute,\u201d the statement said. \u201cIt is our sincere hope that Congress, the courts, and future Fulbright Boards will prevent the administration\u2019s efforts to degrade, dismantle, or even eliminate one of our nation\u2019s most respected and valuable programs.\u201d",
      "Award recipients are selected in a yearlong process by nonpartisan staff at the State Department. The recipients who had their awards canceled are in fields including biology, engineering, medical sciences, and history, the board members said.",
      "The announcement comes as the Trump administration ratchets up scrutiny of international students on several fronts. The administration has expanded the grounds for revoking foreign students' legal status, and recently paused scheduling of new interviews for student visas as it increases vetting of their social media activity.

    "story": [
      "The Environmental Protection Agency is proposing to eliminate rules that limit greenhouse gas emissions from power plants fueled by coal and natural gas",
      "WASHINGTON -- The Environmental Protection Agency on Wednesday proposed repealing rules that limit planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions from power plants fueled by coal and natural gas, an action that Administrator Lee Zeldin said would remove billions of dollars in costs for industry and help \u201cunleash\u201d American energy.",
      "The EPA also proposed weakening a regulation that requires power plants to reduce emissions of mercury and other toxic pollutants that can harm the brain development of young children and contribute to heart attacks and other health problems in adults.",
      "The rollbacks are meant to fulfill Republican President Donald Trump's repeated pledge to \u201c unleash American energy \u201d and make it more affordable for Americans to power their homes and operate businesses.",
      "If approved and made final, the plans would reverse efforts by Democratic President Joe Biden's administration to address climate change and improve conditions in areas heavily burdened by industrial pollution, mostly in low-income and majority Black or Hispanic communities.",
      "The power plant rules are among about 30 environmental regulations that Zeldin targeted in March when he announced what he called the \u201cmost consequential day of deregulation in American history.\u201d",
      "Zeldin said Wednesday the new rules would help end what he called the Biden and Obama administrations\u2019 \u201cwar on so much of our U.S. domestic energy supply.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe American public spoke loudly and clearly last November,'' he added in a speech at EPA headquarters. \u201cThey wanted to make sure that \u2026 no matter what agency anybody might be confirmed to lead, we are finding opportunities to pursue common-sense, pragmatic solutions that will help reduce the cost of living \u2026 create jobs and usher in a golden era of American prosperity.\u201d",
      "Environmental and public health groups called the rollbacks dangerous and vowed to challenge the rules in court.",
      "Dr. Lisa Patel, a pediatrician and executive director of the Medical Society Consortium on Climate & Health, called the proposals \u201cyet another in a series of attacks\u201d by the Trump administration on the nation's \u201chealth, our children, our climate and the basic idea of clean air and water.\u201d",
      "She called it \u201cunconscionable to think that our country would move backwards on something as common sense as protecting children from mercury and our planet from worsening hurricanes, wildfires, floods and poor air quality driven by climate change.\u201d",
      "\u201cIgnoring the immense harm to public health from power plant pollution is a clear violation of the law,'' added Manish Bapna, president and CEO of the Natural Resources Defense Council. \u201cIf EPA finalizes a slapdash effort to repeal those rules, we\u2019ll see them in court.\u201d",
      "The EPA-targeted rules could prevent an estimated 30,000 deaths and save $275 billion each year they are in effect, according to an Associated Press examination that included the agency\u2019s own prior assessments and a wide range of other research.",
      "It\u2019s by no means guaranteed that the rules will be entirely eliminated \u2014 they can\u2019t be changed without going through a federal rulemaking process that can take years and requires public comment and scientific justification.",
      "Even a partial dismantling of the rules would mean more pollutants such as smog, mercury and lead \u2014 and especially more tiny airborne particles that can lodge in lungs and cause health problems, the AP analysis found. It would also mean higher emissions of greenhouse gases, driving Earth\u2019s warming to deadlier levels.",
      "Biden, a Democrat, had made fighting climate change a hallmark of his presidency. Coal-fired power plants would be forced to capture smokestack emissions or shut down under a strict EPA rule issued last year. Then-EPA head Michael Regan said the power plant rules would reduce pollution and improve public health while supporting a reliable, long-term supply of electricity.",
      "The power sector is the nation\u2019s second-largest contributor to climate change, after transportation.",
      "In its proposed regulation, the Trump EPA argues that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases from fossil fuel-fired power plants \u201cdo not contribute significantly to dangerous pollution\u201d or climate change and therefore do not meet a threshold under the Clean Air Act for regulatory action. Greenhouse gas emissions from coal and gas-fired plants \u201care a small and decreasing part of global emissions,'' the EPA said, adding: \u201cThis Administration\u2019s priority is to promote the public health or welfare through energy dominance and independence secured by using fossil fuels to generate power.\u201d",
      "The Clean Air Act allows the EPA to limit emissions from power plants and other industrial sources if those emissions significantly contribute to air pollution that endangers public health.",
      "If fossil fuel plants no longer meet the EPA\u2019s threshold, the Trump administration may later argue that other pollutants from other industrial sectors don\u2019t either and therefore shouldn\u2019t be regulated, said Meghan Greenfield, a former EPA and Justice Department lawyer now in private practice at Jenner & Block LLP.",
      "The EPA proposal \u201chas the potential to have much, much broader implications,\u201d she said.",
      "Zeldin, a former New York congressman, said the Biden-era rules were designed to \u201csuffocate our economy in order to protect the environment,\u201d with the intent to regulate the coal industry \u201cout of existence\u201d and make it \u201cdisappear.\u201d",
      "National Mining Association president and CEO Rich Nolan applauded the new rules, saying they remove \u201cdeliberately unattainable standards\u201d for clean air while \u201cleveling the playing field for reliable power sources, instead of stacking the deck against them.\u201d",
      "But Dr. Howard Frumkin, a former director of the National Center for Environmental Health and professor emeritus at the University of Washington School of Public Health, said Zeldin and Trump were trying to deny reality.",
      "\u201cThe world is round, the sun rises in the east, coal- and gas-fired power plants contribute significantly to climate change, and climate change increases the risk of heat waves, catastrophic storms and many other health threats,\u201d Frumkin said. \u201cThese are indisputable facts. If you torpedo regulations on power plant greenhouse gas emissions, you torpedo the health and well-being of the American public and contribute to leaving a world of risk and suffering to our children and grandchildren.\u201d",
      "A paper published earlier this year in the journal Science found the Biden-era rules could reduce U.S. power sector carbon emissions by 73% to 86% below 2005 levels by 2040, compared with a reduction of 60% to 83% without the rules.",
      "\u201cCarbon emissions in the power sector drop at a faster rate with the (Biden-era) rules in place than without them,\u201d said Aaron Bergman, a fellow at Resources for the Future, a nonprofit research institution and a co-author of the Science paper. The Biden rule also would result in \u201csignificant reductions in sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides, pollutants that harm human health,\u201d he said.",

      "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is defending his decision to order National Guard troops to provide security during immigrations raids in Los Angeles",
      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth defended his decision to order troops to provide security during federal immigration raids in Los Angeles, telling senators on Wednesday it's about \u201cmaintaining law and order.\u201d",
      "Sen. Jack Reed, D-R.I., condemned the move as illegal, saying it erodes military readiness and questioning how it is being funded. It was the second day of harsh congressional questioning for Hegseth on the deployment of troops over the objections of California Gov. Gavin Newsom, continued military aid to Ukraine, a deal on a gifted Qatari jet and more.",
      "\u201cThe mission in Los Angeles, as you know well, sir, is not about lethality,\u201d Hegseth said in response to questions. \u201cIt\u2019s about maintaining law and order on behalf of law enforcement agents who deserve to do their job without being attacked by mobs of people.\u201d",
      "The exchange underscored confusion about the deployment of more than 4,000 National Guard troops and 700 Marines to provide security at the immigration protests and operations in Los Angeles. Photos have shown Guard troops setting a security perimeter around agents as they make arrests in the city, moving them closer to law enforcement functions, which by law they are not allowed to do.",
      "About 2,000 of the Guard soldiers are in place in Los Angeles, initially sent to provide security. The Marines are at a nearby base and have not yet been used.",
      "Speaking at a Senate defense appropriations subcommittee hearing, Reed said law and order is a civil function, not a job for the U.S. military. Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., added that the California deployment, along with President Donald Trump's threat to use force against protesters at the Army's 250th anniversary parade on Saturday, \u201cshould stop every one of us cold.\u201d",
      "She added that \u201cthreatening to use our own troops on our own citizens at such scale is unprecedented. It is unconstitutional. And it is downright un-American.\u201d",
      "Asked later what constitutional authority the department is using to deploy active duty Marines to the protests, Hegseth said he didn't know the specific provision but would provide it.",
      "Gen. Dan Caine, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who was testifying alongside Hegseth, was asked whether he sees evidence of \u201crebellion\u201d in the U.S. That could be used to invoke the Insurrection Act to use the military for law enforcement functions.",
      "\u201cThere are definitely some frustrated folks out there,\u201d Caine said in response.",
      "Answering the same question, Hegseth repeated Trump\u2019s argument that \u201cthere has been an invasion\u201d of migrants entering the country without legal permission, and he said the protests in Los Angeles could spread to other areas.",
      "Caine, asked if he believes the U.S. is being invaded by a foreign power, said, \u201cI don\u2019t see any foreign, state-sponsored folks invading, but I\u2019ll be mindful of the fact that there have been some border issues.\u201d",
      "Hegseth also faced bipartisan criticism for failing to provide details about the administration\u2019s first proposed defense budget and over an array of other decisions he's made during his tenure.",
      "The panel's chairman, Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and other senators expressed frustration that Congress has not yet gotten a full defense budget from the Trump administration and that the current level does not have the U.S. spending enough on defense.",
      "McConnell also noted that the limited budget request that lawmakers have received has no funding for Ukraine security assistance, questioning whether that makes \u201clasting peace\u201d more or less likely.",
      "Hegseth, in his opening remarks, said the department needed more time to pull a spending plan together but that he has moved quickly to kill wasteful programs and redirect funding to Trump\u2019s priorities.",
      "Hegseth said a negotiated peace in Ukraine makes America look strong, even though Russia is the aggressor. He said the budget includes hard choices and \u201creflects the reality that Europe needs to step up more for the defense of its own continent. And President Trump deserves the credit for that.\"",
      "Hegseth said some U.S. security spending for Ukraine is still in the pipeline, but he provided no details.",
      "Hegseth repeatedly refused to provide details on plans for the Defense Department to accept a 747 jet offered by Qatar for use as Air Force One. He said budgeting and schedules for security upgrades to turn the plane into the president's aircraft are classified.",
      "Hegseth confirmed reports that the Qataris have not come to an agreement with the Trump administration over a memo that would allow the military to take possession of the aircraft.",
      "That also means no contracts have been signed to move forward on overhauling the Qatari jet.",
      "He refused to answer questions on the cost or potential timeframe of that upgrade \u2014 even though data on two other 747s being reconditioned by Boeing to serve as Air Force One is public.",
      "\u201cA memorandum of understanding remains to be signed,\u201d Hegseth said.",

The Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals ordered that temporary stay of execution be lifted.",

The Oklahoma Attorney General\u2019s Office maintained the district court judge didn\u2019t have the authority to issue a stay of execution.",

      "William Duplessie and John Woeltz were ordered held in custody until their next court date on July 15 during their arraignment in Manhattan criminal court.",
      "Their lawyers had sought their release on $1 million bail and home confinement with their parents.",
      "They argued the victim wasn't in distress during his time in New York, saying they had obtained video and photo evidence showing the accuser smiling and laughing during the time of his purported captivity.",
      "Among the evidence the lawyers said they have obtained are photos of the accuser moving freely in and out of the house, even taking a trip to an eyeglass store with one of the defendants.",
      "\u201cThis narrative is entirely false,\" said Sam Talkin, Duplessie's lawyer. \u201cThe story that he is selling doesn\u2019t make sense.\u201d",
      "Prosecutor Sania Khan argued that someone supporting the defendants was selectively leaking videos to present a counternarrative of the events",
      "\u201cVictims of abuse are not always going to act the way that we expect them to,\" she added.",
      "Duplessie and Woeltz, who appeared in handcuffs and prison uniforms, didn't speak in court other than to formally enter their pleas.",
      "They face charges of kidnapping, assault, unlawful imprisonment and criminal possession of a weapon.",
      "Prosecutors say on May 6, the two men lured the victim, who they knew personally, to a posh townhouse in Manhattan\u2019s Soho neighborhood by threatening to kill his family.",
      "The man, a 28-year-old Italian national who has not been named by officials, said he was held captive for 17 days.",
      "He said the two investors tormented him with electrical wires, forced him to smoke from a crack pipe and at one point dangled him from a staircase five stories high.",
      "The man said he eventually agreed to hand over his computer password, then managed to flee as his captors went to retrieve the device.",
      "Woeltz, 37, has described himself in interviews as a blockchain investor who spent time in Silicon Valley before returning to Kentucky\u2019s burgeoning crypto-mining industry.",
      "Duplessie, 32, is listed as a founder or investor at various blockchain-based companies.",
      "New York City police are also investigating two detectives who worked security at the townhouse where the man says he was tortured.",
      "The officers have been placed on modified leave pending the outcome of the inquiry, although their lawyer has said there\u2019s no indication either officer witnessed any of the alleged criminal activity.",

      "President Donald Trump is looking to cancel $9.4 billion in spending already approved by Congress",
      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump is looking to cancel $9.4 billion in spending already approved by Congress. That's just a sliver of the $1.7 trillion that lawmakers OK'd for the budget year ending Sept. 30.",
      "The package of 21 budget rescissions will have to be approved by both chambers of Congress for the cuts to take place, beginning with a House vote expected Thursday. Otherwise, the spending remains in place.",
      "The White House is betting that cutting federal investments in public media and some foreign aid programs will prove politically popular. Republicans say if this first effort is successful, they hope more rescission packages will follow as they look to continue work by the so-called Department of Government Efficiency once run by billionaire Elon Musk.",
      "Democrats describe the cuts as inhumane and say they would rip life-saving support from hungry and sick people across the globe. Republicans are describing the cuts as \u201cmodest\u201d and say the U.S. will continue to play a critical role in helping the world's most vulnerable people.",
      "Here's a look at some of the spending the White House is trying to claw back:",
      "The Republican president has asked lawmakers to rescind nearly $1.1 billion from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which represents the full amount it's slated to receive during the next two budget years. Congress has traditionally provided public media with advanced funds to reduce political pressures.",
      "The corporation distributes the money mostly to public television and radio stations around the country, with some assigned to National Public Radio and the Public Broadcasting System to support national programming.",
      "The White House says the public media system is politically biased and an unnecessary expense.",
      "Much of the conservatives' ire is focused on NPR and PBS. \u201cWe believe that you all can hate us on your own dime,\u201d said Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, during a hearing in March.",
      "But about two-thirds of the money goes to more than 1,500 locally owned public radio and television stations. Nearly half of those stations serve rural areas of the country.",
      "\u201cThey want to punish the national guys, that's fine,\u201d said Rep. Mark Amodei, a Republican who said he was undecided going into this week's vote. \u201cBut I'm trying to get a handle on what it means for my stations in Nevada, because the ability to fundraise at the national level ain't the same as the ability to fundraise in Reno.\u201d",
      "The association representing local public television stations warns that many of them would be forced to close if the GOP bill passes. Those stations provide emergency alerts, free educational programming and high school sports coverage and highlight hometown heroes.",
      "Meanwhile, local radio stations say their share of the allocation provides funding for 386 stations employing nearly 10,000 people. Dozens of stations rely on the public grants for more than half of their budget. Many others for nearly half.",
      "Some Republicans say they worry about what the cuts would mean for local public stations but tough decisions are necessary.",
      "Rep. Dusty Johnson, R-S.D., said South Dakota Public Broadcasting does a \u201creally good job of covering the state Legislature\" and other public affairs.",
      "\u201cSo these rescissions are not going to be comfortable for South Dakota to deal with,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cThat being said, we're $37 trillion in debt.\"",
      "Trump's administration is looking to claw back about $900 million from $10 billion that Congress has approved for global health programs.",
      "That includes canceling $500 million for activities related to infectious diseases and child and maternal health and another $400 million to address the global HIV epidemic.",
      "The administration says the $500 million rescission for infectious diseases would not reduce treatment but would \u201celiminate programs that are antithetical to American interests and worsen the lives of women and children, like \u2018family planning\u2019 and \u2018reproductive health,\u2019 LGBTQI+ activities, and equity programs.\u201d It makes a similar assurance on the HIV funding, saying it would eliminate \u201conly those programs that neither provide life-saving treatment nor support American interests.\u201d",
      "Scores of humanitarian aid groups have asked lawmakers to oppose the proposed cuts. Catholic Relief Services called on donors to contact their members of Congress to urge them to vote against the bill. Without the U.S. assistance, \"countless lives are at risk, and the needs will continue to rise,\u201d said the plea to supporters.",
      "The importance of the United States' contribution to the global\u202fHIV\u202fresponse cannot be overstated, according to the Joint United Nations Program on HIV/AIDS. It says the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, or PEPFAR, has saved more than 26 million lives and averted almost 5 million new HIV infections since it was launched in 2003 under President George W. Bush, a Republican.",
      "\u201cInstead of facing a death sentence, people supported by PEPFAR are raising families, building their communities, and helping their communities grow and develop,\u201d said Rep. Rosa DeLauro, D-Conn.",
      "The Trump administration is looking to cancel $800 million, or a quarter of the amount Congress approved, for a program that provides emergency shelter, water and sanitation, and family reunification for those forced to flee their own country. The program also helps vetted refugees who come to the U.S. get started in their new country.",
      "The White House says \u201cthese funds support activities that could be more fairly shared with non-U.S. Government donors, providing savings to the U.S. taxpayer.\u201d",
      "Refugees International urged Congress to reject what it described as a reckless proposal.",
      "About 45% of the savings sought by the White House would come from two programs designed to boost the economies, democratic institutions and civil societies in developing countries.",
      "The administration wants to claw back $2.5 billion of the $3.9 billion approved for the Development Assistance program at the U.S. Agency for International Development and about $1.7 billion, or nearly half of the funds, dedicated to the State Department's Economic Support Fund.",
      "The administration says in its request to Congress that the Development Assistance account is supposed to fund programs that work to end extreme poverty and promote resilient democratic societies, but in practice many of the programs \u201cconflict with American values\u201d and bankroll corrupt leaders' evasion of responsibilities to their citizens while providing \"no clear benefit to Americans.\u201d",

      "Jessica Mann's testimony and rape allegation",
      "Mann testified for days, as she did in Weinstein's 2020 trial, alleging he raped her in a Manhattan hotel room in 2013. She said it happened during a consensual relationship that continued for years afterward, telling the jury she \"compartmentalized\" the pain he caused.",
      "Weinstein's lawyers emphasized she kept seeing him, accepting invitations and sending him messages.",

    "summary": "Brian Wilson was one of the world's most influential recording artists.",
    "story": [
      "Brian Wilson, the Beach Boys' visionary and fragile leader whose genius for melody, arrangements and wide-eyed self-expression inspired \"Good Vibrations,\" \"California Girls\" and other summertime anthems and made him one of the world's most influential recording artists, has died, his family said in a statement posted to his website and social media\u00a0accounts. He was 82.",
      "\"We are heartbroken to announce that our beloved father Brian Wilson has passed away,\" the family said in Wednesday's statement. \"We are at a loss for words right now. Please respect our privacy at this time as our family is grieving. We realize that we are sharing our grief with the world.\"",
      "Further details weren't immediately available. Since May 2024, Wilson had been under a court conservatorship to oversee his personal and medical affairs, with Wilson's longtime representatives, publicist Jean Sievers and manager LeeAnn Hard, in charge.",
      "The eldest and last surviving of three musical brothers \u2014 Brian played bass, Carl lead guitar and Dennis drums \u2014 he and his fellow Beach Boys rose in the 1960s from local California band to national hitmakers to international ambassadors of surf and sun. Wilson himself was celebrated for his gifts and pitied for his demons. He was one of rock's great Romantics, a tormented man who in his peak years embarked on an ever-steeper path to aural perfection, the one true sound.",
      "\"It is indeed hard to talk about the influence of Brian Wilson just on music because he is a shaper of American myth and American culture,\" Joe Levy, a contributor to Rolling Stone and Billboard, told CBS News following the news of Wilson's death. \"Our popular ideas about California \u2014 a land of surf and sun \u2014 many of them come from Beach Boys songs.\"",
      "The Beach Boys rank among the most popular groups of the rock era, with more than 30 singles in the Top 40 and worldwide sales of more than 100 million. The 1966 album \"Pet Sounds\" was voted No. 2 in a 2003 Rolling Stone list of the best 500 albums, losing out, as Wilson had done before, to the Beatles' \"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band.\" The Beach Boys, who also featured Wilson cousin Mike Love and childhood friend Al Jardine, were voted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1988.",
      "Wilson feuded with Love over songwriting credits, but peers otherwise adored him beyond envy, from Elton John and Bruce Springsteen to Katy Perry and Carole King. The Who's drummer, Keith Moon, fantasized about joining the Beach Boys. Paul McCartney cited \"Pet Sounds\" as a direct inspiration on the Beatles and the ballad \"God Only Knows\" as among his favorite songs, often bringing him to tears.",
      "Wilson moved and fascinated fans and musicians long after he stopped having hits. In his later years, Wilson and a devoted entourage of younger musicians performed \"Pet Sounds\" and his restored opus, \"Smile,\" before worshipful crowds in concert halls. Meanwhile, The Go-Go's, Lindsey Buckingham, Animal Collective and Janelle Mon\u00e1e were among a wide range of artists who emulated him, whether as a master of crafting pop music or as a pioneer of pulling it apart.",
      "An endless summer",
      "The Beach Boys' music was like an ongoing party, with Wilson as host and wallflower. He was a tall, shy man, partially deaf (allegedly because of beatings by his father, Murry Wilson), with a sweet, crooked grin, and he rarely touched a surfboard unless a photographer was around. But out of the lifestyle that he observed and such musical influences as Chuck Berry and the Four Freshmen, he conjured a golden soundscape \u2014 sweet melodies, shining harmonies, vignettes of beaches, cars and girls \u2014 that resonated across time and climates.",
      "Decades after its first release, a Beach Boys song can still conjure instant summer \u2014 the wake-up guitar riff that opens \"Surfin' USA\"; the melting vocals of \"Don't Worry Baby\"; the chants of \"fun, fun, fun\" or \"good, good, GOOD, good vibrations\"; the behind-the-wheel chorus \"'Round, 'round, get around, I get around.\" Beach Boys songs have endured from turntables and transistor radios to boom boxes and iPhones, or any device that could lay on a beach towel or be placed upright in the sand.",
      "The band's innocent appeal survived the group's increasingly troubled backstory, whether Brian's many personal trials, the feuds and lawsuits among band members or the alcoholism of Dennis Wilson, who drowned in 1983. Brian Wilson's ambition raised the Beach Boys beyond the pleasures of their early hits and into a world transcendent, eccentric and destructive. They seemed to live out every fantasy, and many nightmares, of the California myth they helped create.",
      "From the suburbs to the national stage",
      "Brian Wilson was born June 20, 1942, two days after McCartney. His musical gifts were soon obvious, and as a boy he was playing piano and teaching his brothers to sing harmony. The Beach Boys started as a neighborhood act, rehearsing in Brian's bedroom and in the garage of their house in suburban Hawthorne, California. Surf music, mostly instrumental in its early years, was catching on locally: Dennis Wilson, the group's only real surfer, suggested they cash in. Brian and Love hastily wrote up their first single, \"Surfin,'\" a minor hit released in 1961.",
      "They wanted to call themselves the Pendletones, in honor of a popular flannel shirt they wore in early publicity photos. But when they first saw the pressings for \"Surfin,'\" they discovered the record label had tagged them \"The Beach Boys.\"",
      "Other decisions were handled by their father, a musician of some frustration who hired himself as manager and holy terror. By mid-decade, Murry Wilson had been displaced and Brian, who had been running the band's recording sessions almost from the start, was in charge, making the Beach Boys the rare group of the time to work without an outside producer.",
      "Their breakthrough came in early 1963 with \"Surfin' USA,\" so closely modeled on Berry's \"Sweet Little Sixteen\" that Berry successfully sued to get a songwriting credit. It was their first Top 10 hit and a boast to the nation: \"If everybody had an ocean / across the USA / then everybody'd be surfin,' / like Cali-for-nye-ay.\" From 1963-66, they were rarely off the charts, hitting No. 1 with \"I Get Around\" and \"Help Me, Rhonda\" and narrowly missing with \"California Girls\" and \"Fun, Fun, Fun.\" For television appearances, they wore candy-striped shirts and grinned as they mimed their latest hit, with a hot rod or surfboard nearby.",
      "Their music echoed private differences. Wilson often contrasted his own bright falsetto with Love's nasal, deadpan tenor. The extroverted Love was out front on the fast songs, but when it was time for a slow one, Brian took over. \"The Warmth of the Sun\" was a song of despair and consolation that Wilson alleged \u2014 to some skepticism \u2014   he wrote the morning after President John F. Kennedy was assassinated. \"Don't Worry Baby,\" a ballad equally intoxicating and heartbreaking, was a leading man's confession of doubt and dependence, an early sign of Brian's crippling anxieties.",
      "Stress and exhaustion led to a breakdown in 1964 and his retirement from touring, his place soon filled by Bruce Johnston, who remained with the group for decades. Wilson was an admirer of Phil Spector's \"Wall of Sound\" productions and emulated him on Beach Boys tracks, adding sleigh bells to \"Dance, Dance, Dance\" or arranging a mini-theme park of guitar, horns, percussion and organ as the overture to \"California Girls.\"",
      "By the mid-1960s, the Beach Boys were being held up as the country's answer to the Beatles, a friendly game embraced by each group, transporting pop music to the level of \"art\" and leaving Wilson a broken man.",
      "The Beach Boys vs. the Beatles",
      "The Beatles opened with \"Rubber Soul,\" released in late 1965 and their first studio album made without the distractions of movies or touring. It was immediately praised as a major advance, the lyrics far more personal and the music far more subtle and sophisticated than such earlier hits as \"She Loves You\" and \"A Hard Day's Night.\" Wilson would recall getting high and listening to the record for the first time, promising himself he would not only keep up with the British band, but top them.",
      "Wilson worked for months on what became \"Pet Sounds,\" and months on the single \"Good Vibrations.\" He hired an outside lyricist, Tony Asher, and used various studios, with dozens of musicians and instruments ranging from violins to bongos to the harpsichord. The air seemed to cool on some tracks and the mood turn reflective, autumnal. From \"I Know There's an Answer\" to \"You Still Believe in Me,\" many of the songs were ballads, reveries, brushstrokes of melody, culminating in the sonic wonders of \"Good Vibrations,\" a psychedelic montage that at times sounded as if recorded in outer space.",
      "The results were momentous, yet disappointing. \"Good Vibrations\" was the group's first million-seller and \"Pet Sounds,\" which included the hits \"Sloop John B\" and \"Wouldn't It Be Nice,\" awed McCartney, John Lennon and Eric Clapton among others. Widely regarded as a new kind of rock LP, it was more suited to headphones than to the radio, a \"concept\" album in which individual songs built to a unified experience, so elaborately crafted in the studio that \"Pet Sounds\" couldn't be replicated live with the technology of the time. Wilson was likened not just to the Beatles, but to Mozart and George Gershwin, whose \"Rhapsody in Blue\" had inspired him since childhood.",
      "But the album didn't chart as highly as previous Beach Boys releases and was treated indifferently by the U.S. record label, Capitol. The Beatles, meanwhile, were absorbing lessons from the Beach Boys and teaching some in return. \"Revolver\" and \"Sgt. Pepper,\" the Beatles' next two albums, drew upon the Beach Boys' vocal tapestries and melodic bass lines and even upon the animal sounds from the title track of \"Pet Sounds.\" The Beatles' epic \"A Day in the Life\" reconfirmed the British band as kings of the pop world and \"Sgt. Pepper\" as the album to beat.",
      "All eyes turned to Wilson and his intended masterpiece \u2014 a \"teenage symphony to God\" he called \"Smile.\" It was a whimsical cycle of songs on nature and American folklore written with lyricist Van Dyke Parks. The production bordered on method acting; for a song about fire, Wilson wore a fire helmet in the studio. The other Beach Boys were confused, and strained to work with him. A shaken Wilson delayed \"Smile,\" then canceled it.",
      "Remnants, including the songs \"Heroes and Villains\" and \"Wind Chimes\" were re-recorded and issued in September 1967 on \"Smiley Smile,\" dismissed by Carl Wilson as a \"bunt instead of a grand slam.\" The stripped down \"Wild Honey,\" released three months later, became a critical favorite but didn't restore the band's reputation. The Beach Boys soon descended into an oldies act, out of touch with the radical '60s, and Wilson withdrew into seclusion.",
      "Years of struggle, and late life validation",
      "Addicted to drugs and psychologically helpless, sometimes idling in a sandbox he had built in his living room, Wilson didn't fully produce another Beach Boys record for years. Their biggest hit of the 1970s was a greatest hits album, \"Endless Summer,\" that also helped reestablish them as popular concert performers.",
      "Although well enough in the 21st century to miraculously finish \"Smile\" and tour and record again, Wilson had been diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder and baffled interviewers with brief and disjointed answers. Among the stranger episodes of Wilson's life was his relationship with Dr. Eugene Landy, a psychotherapist accused of holding a Svengali-like power over him. A 1991 lawsuit from Wilson's family blocked Landy from Wilson's personal and business affairs.",
      "His first marriage, to singer Marilyn Rovell, ended in divorce and he became estranged from daughters Carnie and Wendy, who would help form the pop trio Wilson Phillips. His life stabilized in 1995 with his marriage to Melinda Ledbetter, who gave birth to two more daughters, Daria and Delanie. He also reconciled with Carnie and Wendy and they sang together on the 1997 album \"The Wilsons.\" (Melinda Ledbetter died in 2024.)",
      "In 1992, Brian Wilson eventually won a $10 million out-of-court settlement for lost songwriting royalties. But that victory and his 1991 autobiography, \"Wouldn't It Be Nice: My Own Story,\" set off other lawsuits that tore apart the musical family.",
      "Carl Wilson and other relatives believed the book was essentially Landy's version of Brian's life and questioned whether Brian had even read it. Their mother, Audree Wilson, unsuccessfully sued publisher HarperCollins because the book said she passively watched as her husband beat Brian as a child. Love successfully sued Brian Wilson, saying he was unfairly deprived of royalties after contributing lyrics to dozens of songs. He would eventually gain ownership of the band's name.",
      "The Beach Boys still released an occasional hit single: \"Kokomo,\" made without Wilson, hit No. 1 in 1988. Wilson, meanwhile, released such solo albums as \"Brian Wilson\" and \"Gettin' In Over My Head,\" with cameos by McCartney and Clapton among others. He also completed a pair of albums for the Walt Disney label \u2014 a collection of Gershwin songs and music from Disney movies. In 2012, surviving members of the Beach Boys reunited for a 50th anniversary album, which quickly hit the Top 10 before the group again bickered and separated.",
      "Wilson won two competitive Grammys, for the solo instrumental \"Mrs. O'Leary's Cow\" and for \"The Smile Sessions\" box set. Otherwise, his honors ranged from a Grammy lifetime achievement prize to a tribute at the Kennedy Center to induction into the Songwriters Hall of Fame. In 2018, he returned to his old high school in Hawthorne and witnessed the literal rewriting of his past: The principal erased an \"F\" he had been given in music and awarded him an \"A.\"",

    "published": "Wed, 11 Jun 2025 19:57:15 -0400",
    "summary": "Weinstein was convicted of one of two counts of criminal sexual assault. The jury told the judge they hadn't reached a verdict on the third degree rape charge.",
    "story": [
      "A jury found Harvey Weinstein guilty of one count in his\u00a0sexual assault retrial\u00a0as they returned a partial verdict after days of deliberations.",
      "Weinstein, 73, faced three charges. He was accused of third-degree rape, and two counts of first-degree criminal sexual assault.",
      "The jury told the judge they found Weinstein guilty of criminal sexual assault against\u00a0Miriam Haley.",
      "The jury found Weinstein not guilty of criminal sexual assault regarding accuser\u00a0Kaja Sokola.",
      "The jury told the judge they have not reached a verdict on the charge of third degree rape involving Jessica Mann. The judge sent the jury home for the day, and told them they would continue to deliberate on that count Thursday.",
      "Jury foreperson reports alleged threat from fellow juror",
      "The jury is made up of seven women and five men. They started deliberating on June 5. The verdict came after days of apparently tense deliberations, with jurors sending notes to the judge asking to speak with him privately. Weinstein's defense attorneys has repeatedly asked for a mistrial.",
      "Wednesday, the jury foreperson asked to speak to the judge in private, saying there was infighting going on between the jurors over the rape count, with one allegedly telling another they'd meet them outside one day as an apparent threat.",
      "According to a transcript, the foreperson said, \"Somebody talk to me, 'Oh, we will see you outside,' because I got my decision. I say, 'No, that's my personal decision. You don't have to change me.'\"",
      "That prompted the defense attorney to call for a mistrial and suggest the juror file a complaint with police.",
      "Despite all the fighting between attorneys, Weinstein himself then said, \"This isn't fair. This isn't right. I'm the one on trial. This is my life that's on the line, I am not getting a fair trial. You are endangering me.\"",
      "Weinstein's defense attorney Arthur Aidala told the judge he was disgusted by what was happening. The judge told Aidala the tension in the jury room appears to be schoolyard antics.",
      "The juror foreperson told the judge he does feel safe returning to court Thursday, but instead of going to the jury room, he will meet with a court officer and have court-appointed security.",
      "Accusers Kaja Sokola, Jessica Mann, Miriam Haley speak out",
      "Because the jury is still deliberating on the remaining count, neither the prosecutors nor defense attorneys could comment about the outcome to the press. Weinstein's publicist, however, said the split verdict is still a win.",
      "\"So today we consider this a victory, a win for us, because he beat the toughest charge, which was Kaja Sokola, which is the new charge, which meant that the clock would've had to start ticking again,\" publicist Juda Engelmayer said, \"whereas on the other two, he's already served time for them. So whatever time he might get on this, he's already served five-and-a-half, six years.\"",
      "But the lawyer for Sokola said this is a victory for all women who testified and survivors everywhere Even though Weinstein was not found guilty on her count, the lawyer said Sokola's truth was heard, and her testimony helped bring down a man who believed he was untouchable.",
      "\"I'm very happy he's convicted. That's all that matters,\" Sokola said.",
      "\"I knew how hard it is to prove reasonable doubt for a crime that happened almost 20 years ago. I made sure Kaja knew it, too, and she still stood in her truth, and history is going to remember her for that,\" attorney Lindsay Goldbrum said.",
      "\"I truly hope from the bottom of my heart that standing right here now will give courage to others to speak up, to don't suffer in silence. Because suffering and living with a trauma like this without sharing with other people is like cancer, it can eat you alive,\" Sokola said.",
      "Gloria Allred, Haley's attorney, called her client \"the real hero of this case ... because he was convicted not once but twice based on her testimony.\"",
      "\"The defense set a very disruptive and chaotic tone from the very beginning of this trial, which I suppose was meant to distract jury from undeniable facts. And I'm so grateful that they saw through the nonsense and the antics,\" Haley said.",
      "In a statement, Haley said the verdict gives her hope.",
      "\"Hope that there is a new awareness around sexual violence, and that the myth of the 'perfect victim' is fading. I hope this result empowers others to speak out and seek justice,\" she wrote, in part.",
      "Mann released a statement.",
      "\"I would never lie about rape or use something so traumatic to hurt someone,\" Mann said in her statement. \"Coming forward cost me everything. My privacy, my safety. I laid bare my trauma, my shame \u2013 everything I'd tried to bury just to keep living. Still, I stood up and told the truth. Again and again.\"",
      "Legal expert on Wednesday's happenings",
      "\"This is really rare,\" said Rich Schoenstein, vice chair of litigation practice at Tarter Krinsky & Drogin. \"We're well into deliberations, and the jury essentially said we've agreed on two of the three counts. On one of the counts, we find him guilty. On another of the counts, we find him not guilty. And on the third count we haven't been able to reach a decision. And remember, each count is basically a different victim ... this is just a different decision with respect to each of three women.\"",
      "The charges against Harvey Weinstein",
      "The trial involved accusations from three women:\u00a0Haley, Mann and Sokola.",
      "Haley and Sokola both testified Weinstein forcibly performed oral sex on each of them on separate occasions \u2013 Haley at Weinstein's apartment in July 2006 and Sokola at a Manhattan hotel sometime in late April or early May 2006.",
      "Mann testified Weinstein raped her at a New York hotel in 2013.",
      "All three accusers took the stand during the trial, along with Sokola's former roommate and an ex-aide who worked for Weinstein's film production company. Weinstein himself decided not to testify, his attorney said.",
      "Haley and Mann's accusations were the focus of Weinstein's original 2020 trial. Sokola came forward with her accusations as that trial was ongoing, and the related charges were added to the retrial.",
      "Harvey Weinstein trial timeline",
      "These charges date back to October 2017 when a bombshell expos\u00e9 into Weinstein's alleged misconduct was published in The New York Times, sparking the #MeToo movement.",
      "He surrendered to police in Lower Manhattan months later, in May 2018, and was arraigned on multiple sex assault charges, some of which were later tossed.",
      "As his New York trial got underway in January 2020, he was also indicted on separate sex assault charges in Los Angeles.",
      "On Feb. 24, 2020, after five days of deliberations, Weinstein was found guilty of third-degree rape and criminal sexual act. He was acquitted of three other counts, including predatory sexual assault. The following month, he was sentenced to 23 years in prison.",
      "In December 2022, a Los Angeles jury found Weinstein guilty of three counts of sexual assault, including rape. Two months later, he was sentenced to 16 years in prison on those charges.",
      "Weinstein's 2020 conviction was overturned by the State of New York Court of Appeals in April 2024\u00a0because the judge in the original trial allowed prosecutors to call alleged victims whose accusations were not part of the charges against Weinstein.",
      "The retrial began April 23, 2025, with Weinstein facing an additional new sex crime charge. The trial lasted just over five weeks, with closing arguments given on June 3. Jury deliberations began June 5.",

    "story": [
      "The 2025 Tribeca Festival continues this week with movie screenings, Q&As, industry panel discussions and public performances across New York City. But one program in this year's festival takes place in virtual worlds.",
      "For more than a decade, Tribeca has been expanding its focus beyond cinema and television to include new avenues of storytelling through the use of virtual reality, augmented reality, and other nascent technologies, producing some vivid immersive displays. Even if the storytelling aspect of the programs were limited, the artistic expressions could be powerful. This was especially true with past exhibits that enveloped the viewer in massive spaces, in which computer-generated imagery or time-lapse photography placed the viewer in new worlds, from exploding galaxies to swirling blood vessels.",
      "Hosted under the umbrella title \"In Search of Us,\"\u00a0this year's installation in Lower Manhattan ties 11 projects together under the rubric of impacts on humanity \u2014 exploring topics from artificial intelligence to climate change, war, school shootings and transphobia. The exhibits with the most profound effects are those with the strongest and most emotional stories embedded inside them.",
      "Within a simple, delineated space furnished with minimal furniture, \"Fragile Home,\" by Ond\u0159ej Moravec and Victoria Lopukhina, uses mixed reality to recreate a home in Ukraine that comes under bombardment. Wearing goggles, the viewer walks through a comfortable, well-appointed living room, past a dinner table and a purring cat, and looks outside the window to a peaceful vista \u2014 all of which, in a flash, is replaced by the home's bombed-out remains, vandalized with Russian forces' \"Z\" graffiti.",
      "The sense of violation is made so powerful in so simple a setting \u2014 and the recognition that such destruction is multiplied millions of times over is heart-wrenching. But the objects that survived \u2014 those with personal meaning to just a handful of people \u2013 become representations of resilience to many.",
      "\"Scent,\" by Alan Kwan, is a first-person cinematic game in which the player becomes a dog wandering a landscape, who observes people being attacked and killed by malevolent forces. In between avoiding bombs and gunfire, the dog helps guide the souls of those killed to become reincarnated. It's a meditative view of cruel violations impacting humanity and nature.",
      "Armed with a tablet, viewers of the augmented reality \"There Goes Nikki\" can wander a garden populated by virtual flowers, and a visualization of the late poet Nikki Giovanni reciting her poem, \"Quilting the Black-eyed Pea (We're going to Mars).\" By Idris Brewster, Michele Stephenson and Joe Brewster.",
      "How dangerous is artificial intelligence? How dumb is it? How snarky?\u00a0 \"AI & Me: The Confessional and AI Ego,\" directed by Daniela Nedovescu and Octavian Mot, provides viewers with an opportunity to become test subjects, as it were, to AI's judgmental streak. Upon sitting in a chair, the participant is captured on camera and analyzed by AI, which conjures up your name, personality traits, and goals. How close are they to reality? Prepare to get snarked. But if the AI program \"likes\" you? Your AI-altered image will turn up in its pantheon of favored carbon-based units (pictured above, right).",
      "Other exhibits are immersive representations of culture \u2014 some self-generated, some created by AI.",
      "\"Uncharted\" (VR, by Kidus Hailesilassie) combines footage of a dancer with spoken word and visualizations of symbols to become a rapturous demonstration of pan-African language and storytelling.",
      "The interactive \"New Maqam City,\" by MIPSTERZ, allows you to become a DJ, manipulating drum beat patterns recognizable in Muslim communities around the world to create a transcendent vibe.",
      "\"The Innocence of Unknowing\" is a video essay and AI project studying media coverage of mass shootings, projected within a simulated classroom. (Created by Ryat Yezbick and Milo Talwani through the MIT Open Documentary Lab.)",
      "One of the strongest impacts of any installation was made by \"In the Current of Being,\" by Cameron Kostopoulos. Using haptic VR, the viewer is literally strapped into a chair; electrodes are attached to your fingertips, arms, and torso, along with VR goggles. Interesting, you think. Then, the presentation begins, recounting the true story of a survivor of electroshock conversion therapy. (As a teenager, Carolyn Mercer had been \"treated\" with electrical shocks in an attempt to \"cure\" her from becoming trans.) As images of female beauty are flashed before you, electrical impulses throb across your body. Ironically, the creators' use of  haptic VR to demonstrate the harrowing effects of the pseudoscience of conversion therapy makes  one never want to have VR electrodes attached to your body.",
      "Beyond the confines of\u00a0 the exhibition space at 161 Water Street, the two-part \"The Power Loom and The Founders Pillars\" (by Lesiba Mabitsela, Meghna Singh and Simon Wood) includes a site-specific AR experience, visible on a mobile app six blocks away, at the New York Stock Exchange, creating a memorial to enslaved people once sold at the Wall Street Slave Market, established in the 18th century.",
      "While the Tribeca Festival proper concludes on June 15, \"In Search of Us,\" presented in partnership with Onassis ONX and Agog: The Immersive Media Institute, runs through June 29. For more details and ticket info click here.",

    "summary": "HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. fired the previous roster of the CDC's vaccine advisers on Monday.",
    "story": [
      "Health and Human Services Secretary\u00a0Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced Wednesday he's naming eight new advisers to serve on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's vaccine recommendations committee, after firing the committee's entire previous roster of 17 advisers.",
      "\"All of these individuals are committed to evidence-based medicine, gold-standard science, and common sense. They have each committed to demanding definitive safety and efficacy data before making any new vaccine recommendations,\" Kennedy said Wednesday in a post on X.",
      "Kennedy's picks circumvented the usual CDC process for selecting members of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, known as ACIP. In previous administrations, career agency officials \u2014 not political leaders \u2014 vetted potential experts before forwarding them to the department for the secretary's approval.",
      "The panel's influential recommendations are closely watched because they are directly tied to federal policies, like which vaccines insurers are required to cover.",
      "The picks announced by Kennedy include some close allies of the secretary and his inner circle. Several have a history of criticizing vaccine recommendations or questioning their safety.",
      "\"The speed with which these members were selected, and the lack of transparency in the process, does not help to restore public confidence and trust, and contributes to confusion and uncertainty,\" Dr. Jason Goldman, president of the American College of Physicians, said in a statement.",
      "Here is a look at those named:",
      "Dr. Robert Malone",
      "One of the Kennedy allies named to the committee, Dr. Robert Malone, worked on early research related to mRNA vaccine technology but was accused during the COVID-19 pandemic of spreading misinformation about the mRNA vaccines. He was with Kennedy and President Trump at the Trump election night celebration in Florida.",
      "\"On the basis of data from all over the world, approximately three years ago it was my impression that the risk/benefit ratio of these products did not merit continued use in any cohort,\" Malone posted last month on his Substack about the mRNA COVID vaccines.",
      "Like Kennedy, Malone has questioned the benefits of measles vaccines during the recent record outbreak in Texas, which killed two children, and he has promoted unproven treatments for the virus.",
      "Dr. Martin Kulldorff",
      "Another member picked by Kennedy is Dr. Martin Kulldorff, an epidemiologist who co-authored the pandemic-era Great Barrington Declaration criticizing COVID-19 restrictions, along with now-NIH Director Dr. Jay Bhattacharya. Bhattacharya has described Kulldorff as a close friend.",
      "Kulldorff previously worked with the CDC's outside vaccine advisers, before authoring an opinion piece in 2021 criticizing the agency's decision to pause use of Johnson & Johnson's COVID-19 vaccine over safety concerns.",
      "He claimed he was fired from working with the committee over the opinion piece. Kulldorff later claimed he was fired from Harvard University for criticizing COVID-19 vaccine requirements.",
      "Dr. Cody Meissner",
      "Dr. Cody Meissner, a pediatrics professor who previously served as a member of the Food and Drug Administration's own vaccines panel \u2014 the Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee \u2014 was also named to the committee.",
      "Meissner opposed COVID-19 vaccine requirements for children. He also co-authored an opinion piece with now-FDA Commissioner Dr. Marty Makary speaking out against masking of children during the pandemic.",
      "Vicky Pebsworth, Ph.D., R.N.",
      "Vicky Pebsworth, a regional director of the National Association of Catholic Nurses, was also a former member of the FDA vaccines panel.",
      "Pebsworth spoke at a 2020 meeting of the FDA vaccines committee, where she identified herself as the research director for the National Vaccine Information Center and \"mother of a child injured by his 15-month well-baby shots in 1998.\" She said the center's position was that any \"coercion and sanctions to persuade adults to take an experimental vaccine, or give it to their children, is unethical and unlawful.\"",
      "Retsef Levi, Ph.D.",
      "Kennedy also praised another pick, MIT professor Retsef Levi, saying: \"Dr. Levi has collaborated with public health agencies to evaluate vaccine safety, including co-authoring studies on mRNA COVID-19 vaccines and their association with cardiovascular risks.\"",
      "Levi previously called for more detailed data from the COVID-19 vaccine trials, suggesting that changes to how Pfizer's shot was produced may have caused side effects.",
      "He\u00a0faced criticism\u00a0for a paper co-authored with Florida Surgeon General Dr. Joseph Ladapo, which was cited in the state's move to recommend that young men not get mRNA COVID-19 vaccines. Experts\u00a0condemned\u00a0the paper for misleading methods that could inflate the risk.",
      "Dr. Michael A. Ross",
      "Kennedy said Dr. Michael A. Ross \"contributed to national strategies for cancer prevention and early detection, including those involving HPV immunization,\" working with the CDC's breast and cervical cancer committee.",
      "Ross is described by Kennedy as an obstetrics and gynecology professor at George Washington University and Virginia Commonwealth University, though his name does not appear on directories for either university.",
      "\"Dr. Michael Ross has not held a faculty appointment at the George Washington University since 2017,\" Katelyn Deckelbaum, a spokesperson for the university, told CBS News in an email.",
      "Deckelbaum said that Ross was previously a clinical professor, but stopped teaching medical students or residents at the university.",
      "The investment firm Havencrest Capital Management lists Ross as a partner, and says he previously worked as an executive for India-based drugmaker Cadila Pharmaceutical. The firm said Ross is a pediatrics professor, not an obstetrics and gynecology professor.",
      "A spokesperson for HHS did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the discrepancies.",
      "Dr. James Pagano",
      "Dr. James Pagano, described by Kennedy as a \"strong advocate for evidence-based medicine,\" has published two fiction titles about hospital medicine.",
      "\"Over the course of his medical career he has worked in a number of emergency departments in the greater L.A. area, including major trauma centers as well as smaller community hospitals. He has been the medical director of one ER or another for many years,\" describes an Amazon listing for one of his books in 2012.",
      "A blog and X account with Pagano's name from several years ago wrote about a range of issues, like\u00a0voicing disappointment over Republicans failing to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, but says little about vaccines.",
      "Records from the Medical Board of California list Pagano as being retired.",
      "Dr. Joseph Hibbeln",
      "Another Kennedy pick, Dr. Joseph Hibbeln, retired from the National Institutes of Health in 2020. His research portfolio previously covered nutritional intake of fatty acids like omega-3. Kennedy described him as bringing \"expertise in immune-related outcomes, psychiatric conditions, and evidence-based public health strategies.\"",
      "Hibbeln previously co-authored a study probing whether exposure during pregnancy to mercury was linked to autism, in the wake of now-debunked research that falsely suggested a mercury-based preservative that was previously used in vaccines was causing autism.",
      "They concluded that there was \"no consistent evidence from this study to implicate prenatal exposure to mercury\" in causing autism, and that \"the benefits of nutrients in fish counteract any possible adverse cognitive and behavioral differences\" caused by mercury exposure.",
      "Kennedy's monthslong search for new members",
      "Kennedy's picks cap a monthslong search that the secretary and his aides have conducted for replacements to the committee.",
      "Former CDC official Jeffrey Klausner, a professor at the USC Keck School of Medicine, said he was among those approached for suggestions early this year.",
      "Klausner criticized Kennedy's pick of Malone, calling him a \"a well-known promoter of various conspiracy theories and was advocating for use of ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine in the treatment of COVID.\"",
      "\"Seems like his appointment is not consistent with some of Secretary Kennedy's public commitments,\" Klausner said.",
      "Kennedy told reporters on Monday that he was picking \"highly credentialed\" experts for the panel.",
      "\"We're going to bring people onto the ACIP panel, not anti-vaxxers, who are bringing people on who are credentialed scientists, who are highly credentialed physicians, who are going to do evidence-based medicine,\" he said.",

    "story": [
      "Americans often voice\u00a0their frustrations over the ubiquity of tipping, but that hasn't stopped them from giving generously to reward good service.",
      "Consumers spent an estimated $77.6 billion on tips for food purchased at restaurants, bars and other eateries in 2023, according to a new study by LendingTree. The analysis, which draws on the most recent government data available, gives readers a snapshot of how much Americans tip and in which states they tip the most. It found that tipping rates tend to be higher in states where people eat out more.",
      "LendingTree also looked at which states drop the most money to dine out. Hint: It's not New York as some might suspect.",
      "See where your state ranks in terms of tipping below.",
      "Where do people tip the most?",
      "New Hampshire residents are the No. 1 tippers in the country, according to the LendingTree study. On average, they leave a gratuity of 16.07% of spending on food away from home \u2014 falling within the standard range of 15% to 20% tips at restaurants. New Hampshire's average tipping rate is four times that of the nation's lowest tipping state, which is Utah at 4.09%.",
      "But that's not to say Utah residents are stingy. As LendingTree points out, average tipping rates hinge on how much people in each state spend on food outside the home \u2014 which includes full-service restaurants as well as fast food place and even vending machines. In other words, not all food that's consumed outside the home is purchased at establishments where tipping is common.",
      "\"If people in one state tend to dine at full-service restaurants far more often than those in another state, it stands to reason their overall percentage spent on tips would be higher,\" LendingTree Chief Consumer Financial Analyst Matt Schulz wrote in the study.",

Even with tips they still may not reach the standard minimum wage of $7.25, in which case employers are required to step in and make up the difference, per the Fair Labor Standards Act.",
      "Tipping in the service industry has recently come into focus with the \"No Tax on Tips\" \u2014 a provision baked into the GOP spending bill that would remove federal taxes from tips for workers who earn less than $160,000. If passed, \"No Tax on Tips\" could offer relief to the 4 million people in the U.S. who work in tipped occupations, about 2.5% of all U.S. workers, according to the Yale Budget Lab.",

      "The Air India plane crash on Thursday is putting a renewed spotlight on Boeing, the manufacturer of the 787-8 Dreamliner aircraft that crashed in the western Indian city of Ahmedabad with 242 passengers and crew on board.",
      "Boeing says the 787-8 is the aviation industry's \"best-selling passenger widebody of all time,\" carrying more than 1 billion passengers since it was first delivered to airlines in 2011.",
      "There's no evidence yet to signal what caused the crash, and the 787-8 Dreamliner has generally had a good safety record. U.S. safety officials said they are heading to India to assist in the investigation of the accident.",
      "\"The NTSB will be leading a team of U.S. investigators travelling to India to assist the Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau with its investigation into the crash of an Air India Boeing 787 in Ahmedabad, India, Thursday,\" the National Transportation Safety Board said in a social media post.",
      "In a statement, the Federal Aviation Administration said the local government leads an investigation when it occurs in that country. \"In the event assistance is requested, the NTSB is the official U.S. representative and the FAA provides technical support. We stand ready to launch a team immediately in coordination with the NTSB,\" the agency said.",

      "First crash of a Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner",
      "The Air India incident represents the first crash of a 787-8 Dreamliner, although the aircraft has been involved in previous investigations.",
      "The aircraft was designed by Boeing to handle longer nonstop routes, which the company says had opened up 425 new routes around the world since the aircraft was introduced.",
      "A police official told The Associated Press there were no known survivors from the plane, and there were also likely casualties on the ground as the aircraft careened into buildings.",
      "The Federal Aviation Administration last year ordered inspections of the cockpit seats on the Dreamliners after one of the jets went into a dive when the captain's seat lurched forward without warning and disconnected the plane's autopilot system, according to The Associated Press.",
      "Last year, a whistleblower's allegations prompted the FAA to investigate his claims about assembly defects in the company's 787 Dreamliner.",
      "Sam Salehpour, a Boeing quality engineer, said \"he observed shortcuts taken by Boeing\" during assembly of the Dreamliner, \"resulting in drilling debris left in interfaces and deformation of composite material,\" CBS News reported. He also claimed to have witnessed issues with the 777 assembly process, according to a letter sent by Salehpour's lawyers to the FAA last year.",
      "For now, it is unclear if those reported issues are linked in any way to the Air India crash.",
      "The Dreamliner in the Air India crash",
      "The aircraft involved in the Air India crash was first delivered to the airline in January 2014. It was on its way from the western Indian city of Ahmedabad to London's Gatwick airport when it crashed shortly after its departure.",
      "The plane had logged more than 41,000 hours of flying time, with almost 8,000 takeoffs and landings, according to Cirium, an aviation analytics firm. Air India operates 190 aircraft, with an average age of 8.4 years, Cirium said.",
      "There are more than 1,100 Dreamliners operating across the globe today, with the aircraft having been in operation for an average of 7.5 years, Cirium noted.",
      "Other Boeing safety issues",
      "The incident comes after a string of safety issues for Boeing, which has faced investigations and lawsuits for two crashes involving its 737 Max jetliners that killed a total of 346 people.",
      "In May, the aircraft manufacturer\u00a0reached a $1.1 billion deal\u00a0with the Department of Justice that allows it to avoid prosecution for the crashes, which occurred in 2018 and 2019.",
      "An April 2025 analysis of commercial jet safety from Boeing shows that the airline industry has improved its overall safety record over the past several decades, although there was an increase in accidents in 2024. According to the report, there were 47 accidents last year across the airline industry, including 12 hull losses, and 187 fatalities.",

      "\"There are two main drivers behind the drop in prices \u2014 abatement in the conversation about bird flu, and some seasonality in uses of eggs. Typically as we move into summer, demand for eggs soften as people shift to consuming more meat and grilling outdoors,\" Brett House, an economics professor at Columbia Business School, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"People aren't making heavy breakfasts, so we don't see demand for eggs being as strong as it typically is during the winter months.\"",

    "story": [
      "The Republicans' \"big beautiful\" budget package\u00a0is uniting everyone from Elon Musk to Wall Street over an issue that experts say could pose a threat to the nation's long-term fiscal stability: the rising cost of servicing the U.S. government's growing mountain of debt.",
      "The U.S. spent $1.1 trillion in interest on its debt in 2024 \u2014 almost double the amount it was paying five years ago, according to Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis data. The nation now spends more on interest payments than it does on defense,\u00a0data from the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute shows.",
      "Those costs could rise even more under the Republican tax and spending bill now being considered in the Senate, according to a June 5 analysis by the Congressional Budget Office. The version of the tax bill\u00a0passed by the House last month is projected to increase the federal deficit \u2014 the gap between what the federal government spends each year and what it collects in revenue \u2014 by $2.4 trillion over the next decade, the nonpartisan agency found.",
      "That would require the government to raise additional debt, resulting in additional interest payments of about $550 billion over the next decade, the CBO forecasts. By 2035, interest on the nation's debt could reach $1.8 trillion, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a nonpartisan think tank focused on fiscal issues.",
      "\"The interest costs now are bigger than defense spending, which is an extraordinary,\" Chris Edwards, an expert on federal tax issues at the Cato Institute, a libertarian-leaning think tank, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"The budget threat here is that all of these increasing federal interest costs will crowd out all the other priorities in the federal budget that the policymakers want to spend on.\"",
      "In other words, the federal government could struggle to support vital programs like Social Security as a larger share of its budget is eaten up by interest payments on the nation's swelling debt.",
      "Federal interest payments as a share of the nation's gross domestic product stood at 3% last year,\u00a0according\u00a0to Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis data. If current trends holds, that could rise to 4.1% of GDP by 2035, the nonpartisan Peter G. Peterson Foundation estimates.",
      "Democrats have pointed to analyses showing the bill's tax cuts will benefit wealthier Americans far more than low- and middle-income workers while also adding to the national debt.",
      "\"No single piece of legislation in my time here in Congress will do more to add to the national debt than this one,\" Rep. Brendan Boyle, a Democrat from Pennsylvania who voted against the legislation,\u00a0said\u00a0last month on the House floor.",
      "Many Republicans, however, point to the bill's proposed tax cuts as providing an avenue for economic growth. \"We are going to celebrate a new golden age in America,\" House Speaker Mike Johnson said last month after the bill passed in the House.",
      "Concerns from Elon Musk, Wall Street",
      "The cost of paying for the nation's debt has drawn concern from many corners, including Tesla CEO Elon Musk, who earlier this month posted about it on social media as he voiced his objections to the GOP bill.",
      "\"Congress is spending America into bankruptcy!\" Musk posted on June 5, pointing to data showing that interest payments have risen from $416 billion in 2014 to more than $1 trillion in 2024.",
      "Moody's Ratings downgraded U.S. credit\u00a0last month, citing among its reasons the mounting concerns about the nation's increasing debt load and interest payments.",
      "\"Successive U.S. administrations and Congress have failed to agree on measures to reverse the trend of large annual fiscal deficits and growing interest costs,\" the credit rating agency said. \"Over the next decade, we expect larger deficits as entitlement spending rises while government revenue remains broadly flat.\"",
      "Moody's added, \"In turn, persistent, large fiscal deficits will drive the government's debt and interest burden higher.\"",
      "On June 7, the White House said in a memo that the GOP tax bill \"significantly improves our nation's fiscal trajectory by including $1.7 trillion in mandatory savings,\" while President Trump's tax cuts will spur economic growth.",
      "Some economic forecasters project that Mr. Trump's tariffs will drag down U.S. growth. The nation's growth could slide to 1.6% in 2025 and 1.5% next year partly because of those import levies, a sharp reduction from the 2.8% growth recorded last year, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development said last week.",
      "How did interest payments get so big?",
      "In recent years, interest payments on the federal debt have ballooned for two main reasons. First, a series of COVID-related spending bills provided $4.6 trillion to individuals and businesses to help them keep afloat during the pandemic, with much of that funding financed through the issuance of new government debt.",
      "Second, the Federal Reserve started hiking interest rates in March of 2022 to tame high inflation. But that also meant the Treasury Department needed to pay higher rates to bondholders, adding to the cost of servicing the nation's burgeoning debt.",
      "In 2020, the U.S. had about $27 trillion in outstanding debt, according to Treasury data. By 2024, that had jumped 32% to $35.5 trillion. Over that time, the Fed's benchmark interest rate rose from close to zero percent to a high of more than 5% in 2024.",
      "One reason the Republican budget bill is forecast to increase the deficit \u2014 and add to the nation's interest costs \u2014 is that it would extend President Trump's 2017 tax cuts, as well as add other breaks, such as eliminating taxes on worker tips and overtime pay.",
      "Altogether, those tax cuts will cost $3.75 trillion, the CBO estimates. The revenue loss would be partially offset by nearly $1.3 trillion in reduced federal spending elsewhere, namely through Medicaid and food assistance. But that still leaves a significant funding gap.",

    "summary": "U.S. and Chinese trade teams appeared to make modest progress a month before paused monster tariffs are due to resume, but Trump says a deal \"is done.\"",
    "story": [
      "London \u2014\u00a0President Trump declared on Wednesday morning that a U.S. trade \"deal with China is done.\" The U.S. leader offered a few key details of a \"framework deal\" reached between senior U.S. and Chinese trade representatives in London on Tuesday, but he acknowledged that both he and Chinese President Xi Jinping were both yet to formally sign off on the agreement.",
      "The U.S. and Chinese trade teams wrapped up two days of marathon negotiations in London close to midnight on Tuesday, with the sides saying they had agreed on a new \"framework deal\" to ease the trade war between the world's two largest economies.",
      "The tension had only increased in recent weeks, despite an agreement reached in Geneva during a first round of talks in May to put the steepest retaliatory tariffs on hold. Those record-high tariffs are due to kick back in on July 9, unless the agreement struck in London is in fact formalized by Trump and Xi.",
      "In month since the Geneva talks, Beijing had cut its exports of critical rare earth elements to the U.S. by half compared to the previous year, and the Trump administration said it would \"aggressively revoke\" the visas of Chinese students in the U.S. who were found to be linked to the Chinese Communist party.",
      "While the announcement by Mr. Trump's top negotiators on Tuesday evening of an agreed framework was thin on details, the president\u00a0said in a post on his own Truth Social media platform Wednesday morning that it was \"done, subject to final approval with president Xi and me.\"",
      "Mr. Trump said the deal would see China maintain its current 10% tariffs on goods imported from the U.S., while the U.S. would keep 55% tariffs on Chinese imports.",
      "\"President XI and I are going to work closely together to open up China to American Trade,\" Mr. Trump added in a subsequent post. \"This would be a great WIN for both countries!!!\"",
      "There was no immediate confirmation from China's government of any terms agreed to in the framework, or whether President Xi intended to sign off on the deal.",
      "In Geneva, Beijing and Washington agreed in May to put their unprecedented tariffs of more than 100% on each other's imports on hold for 90 days. That brought U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports down to their current level of 30% after they briefly soared to around 145%.",
      "Chinese tariffs currently stand at 10%, after hitting 125% before the Geneva round of talks.",
      "Speaking Tuesday, Vice Commerce Minister Li Chenggang, who took part in the talks in London, confirmed the agreement on a framework, \"in principle.\"",
      "On Wednesday, China's state-run media said the delegations had \"made new progress,\" but offered no details.",
      "\"The framework deal puts meat on the bones of an agreement reached last month in Geneva to ease bilateral retaliatory tariffs,\" U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told reporters after the talks in London, which spanned six hours on Monday and then more than 12 hours into the evening on Tuesday.",
      "Lutnick said part of the objective of this week's second round of meetings was just to get \"the negativity out\" of the bilateral relationship, which had festered since the Geneva talks.",
      "\"Now we can go forward to try to do positive trade, growing trade,\" he said.",
      "The U.S. wants China to resume and increase shipments of rare earths. The materials are vital to industries ranging from weapons and aerospace to electric vehicles and small consumer goods.",
      "On Wednesday, in his all-capital-letter social media post, Mr. Trump said under the agreement reached in London, \"full magnets, and any necessary rare earths, will be supplied, up front, by China. Likewise, we will provide to China what was agreed to, including Chinese students using our colleges and universities.\"",
      "\"Relationship is excellent!\" added Mr. Trump.",
      "\"At stake is the release of rare earths exports to U.S. manufacturers \u2014 stockpiles are dwindling fast \u2014 in exchange for aerospace parts and semiconductor programming technology to China,\" Carl Weinberg, chief economist at High Frequency Economics, told investors in a report. \"A 'fail' would raise the risk of auto and aircraft production grinding to a halt as soon as next month.

    "story": [
      "The clock is ticking on President Trump's proposal to Iran to accept restrictions on its nuclear program \u2014 and possibly avert a potential military strike by Israel, which could involve U.S. support.",
      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu spoke with Mr. Trump Monday regarding the diplomatic efforts and publicly announced Mr. Trump had told him Iran was expected to respond in the coming days.",
      "In the meantime, Steve Witkoff, the president's Mideast envoy, plans to hold a sixth round of talks with Iran Sunday. Those talks will be held in the small Gulf state of Oman, according to a source familiar with the plans.",
      "U.S. and Israeli officials confirmed diplomatic efforts are still underway, though multiple U.S. officials say they believe Israel may be preparing an imminent military strike against Iran.",
      "On Thursday, the United Nations' Vienna-based nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency, stated that Iran is not complying with nuclear non-proliferation obligations. Iran swiftly condemned the finding as politically motivated.",
      "Iranian Foreign Minister Seyed Abbas Araghchi, in a post on X, accused the UK, France and Germany, the three major European powers collectively known as the E3, of fomenting confrontation. The E3 remains a party to the 2015 international nuclear agreement known as the JCPOA. The U.S. withdrew from the agreement in 2018, and Iran partially withdrew in 2019. The European countries who remain party to the deal could seek to trigger the snapback of UN sanctions on Iran in the coming months.",
      "\"Another major strategic mistake by the E3 will compel Iran to react strongly,\" Araghchi said in the post.",
      "Following the IAEA determination that it was not in compliance, Iran announced that the head of its atomic energy organization issued orders for a new enrichment facility and replacement of centrifuges at the underground facility at Fordow.",
      "Mr. Trump publicly declared on Truth Social last week that he would not allow Iran to enrich any uranium, but the White House has not so far not disclosed the contents of the nuclear proposal.",
      "Nearly two weeks ago, Witkoff transmitted to Iran via Omani officials a proposal from the U.S. Two sources familiar with the details of that proposal told CBS News that the U.S. does not want Iran to develop any domestic enrichment of nuclear fuel for what it claims is a civilian program. To maintain that limited program, the two sources said Iran would have to procure the enriched nuclear fuel from outside the country, rather than enrich it on Iranian soil.",
      "Mr. Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin discussed Iran last Wednesday during a lengthy call that lasted over an hour, according to Mr. Trump's post on Truth Social. Mr. Trump said that time is running out on Iran's decision-making about nuclear weapons.",
      "He said Putin \"suggested that he will participate in the discussions with Iran\" and that he could be helpful in concluding the talks. Tehran and Moscow have forged an informal military alliance in Ukraine, with Russian forces using Iranian-produced Shahed drones to bomb Ukrainian targets, including civilians.",
      "Moscow could play a few roles in the negotiations with Iran, a source familiar with the proposal explained to CBS News. Russia could be a source for nuclear fuel purchase by Iran, for instance, or it could also be the receiving country for the storage of the existing enriched uranium produced by Iran. This would be similar to the role it played under the 2015 international nuclear agreement known as the JCPOA.",
      "There are also other ideas proposed by the U.S., too. Axios was first to report that Oman suggested establishing a regional consortium to enrich uranium for civilian purposes under monitoring by the IAEA and the U.S. A source familiar with the proposal indicated that this was one of the ideas presented to Tehran.",
      "During testimony before a Senate panel Wednesday, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth fielded questions about the diplomatic efforts.",
      "\"There are plenty of indications that they have been moving their way towards something that would look a lot like a nuclear weapon,\" Hegseth said in response to a question about whether Tehran's nuclear program was peaceful. The powerful chair of the U.S. Senate Intelligence Committee \u2013 GOP Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas \u2013 appeared to seize on that statement in a social media post in which he said, \"Iran's terrorist regime is actively working towards a nuclear weapon.\"",
      "But U.S. intelligence assesses that Iran halted its nuclear weapons program in 2003. U.S. intelligence has also assessed that Tehran has continued since 2018 to enrich nuclear fuel at levels close to weapons grade. Due to that enrichment, U.S. intelligence assesses that Iran is currently a threshold nuclear state, which means it could decide to pursue a weaponization program within relatively short order.",
      "Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu has long been a skeptic of diplomatic attempts to restrain Iran's nuclear program and often points to documents stolen by the Mossad back in 2018 as evidence of past Iranian ambition to acquire its own nuclear weapon. Netanyahu has been pressing Mr. Trump to provide U.S. support for Israeli military action against Iran, arguing that Tehran is in a historically weak position, given the success of the Israeli decapitation of its militia Hezbollah and its decimation of Hamas in Gaza.",
      "While Mr. Trump has held off on sanctioning Russia, which the administration has said is to avoid disrupting diplomatic outreach on Ukraine, he has sanctioned Iran amid an attempt at diplomacy regarding the nuclear program.",
      "Last Friday, the Treasury Department announced sanctions against 30 individuals tied to two Iranian brothers alleged to have helped launder billions of dollars through front companies that the regime uses to help fund its nuclear and missile programs.",
      "CBS News obtained a classified version of a report presented to member states by IAEA Director General Rafael Grossi. The report notes that Iran is the only non-nuclear weapon state in the world that is producing and accumulating uranium enriched to 60%, which remains a matter of serious concern. Uranium for civilian use is enriched to a much lower rate, between 3% and 5%.",
      "Mark Dubowitz, of U.S.-based Foundation for Defense of Democracies, told CBS News that the report proved that \"Iran is a serial violator of the [Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty], stonewalling the IAEA on its past \u2014 and possibly ongoing \u2014 nuclear weaponization work.\"",
      "Dubowitz and other pro-Israel advocates are raising alarms and argue the Iranian regime should not have any right to enrich uranium on its soil.",
      "The IAEA director general also reiterated in his report his call for Iran to cooperate with IAEA inspections \u2014 or risk \"the Agency will not be in a position to provide assurance that Iran's nuclear programme is exclusively peaceful.\"",
      "Israel has an undeclared nuclear weapons program, and the IAEA has no access to its facility at Dimona, which is believed to provide the fuel for its weapons program. The IAEA does monitor the site known as Soreq. At this point, Israel maintains a strategic edge as the only nuclear power in the Mideast.",

      "The looming federal funding cuts to public television and radio would overwhelmingly gut outlets in states won by President Trump in 2024, according to a new congressional report.",
      "Approximately 60% of the hundreds of radio and television stations that could suffer funding cuts are in Trump-won states, according to a congressional report obtained by CBS News from Senate Democrats.",
      "The organizations that would be affected include public media outlets in cities as large as Houston and Miami, as well as smaller stations in tiny communities like Douglas, Wyoming, which has a population of 6,000 and hosts the Wyoming State Fair.",
      "The widespread cuts to public radio and television are a component of a Republican congressional plan to eliminate $9 billion in funding for programs approved before President Trump's second term began.",
      "The proposed rescissions package, which is scheduled for a House vote Thursday, includes $1.1 billion in cuts for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which provides funding to NPR and PBS. The cuts to public broadcasting are being touted by the Trump administration and Republicans as an effort to slash taxpayer funding for news media outlets they accuse of being \"liberal\" or politically biased in their content.",
      "Advocates for public broadcasting have lambasted the cuts as destructive, needless and harmful to communities that have very limited sources of local broadcast news. They also deny allegations of political bias.",
      "The list of hundreds of TV and radio outlets facing funding cuts shows a broad range of impact. Major public television and radio stations in Charlotte, North Carolina, and Washington, D.C., could each lose nearly $1 million in grants in the coming months. An FM community public radio station in Carbondale, Colorado, which touts itself as \"Public access radio that connects community members to one another and the world,\" received $145,000 in federal grant funding last year.",
      "At each of the public media outlets, the list shows reductions that are sizable enough to potentially require staffing cuts, programming reductions or news cutbacks that threaten to exacerbate shortages of local news content.",
      "CBS News' review of proposed grant cuts shows Alabama, a state with an estimated 215 public media employees, would lose as much as $3 million in funding for its public television outlets in the coming months.",
      "In South Dakota, a sparsely populated state that nonetheless receives $3 million in funds for public broadcasting employees, the funding cuts would gut money for at least 20 media outlets, according to the report provided by congressional aides to CBS News.",
      "\"The path to better public media is achievable only if funding is maintained. Otherwise, a vital lifeline that operates reliable emergency communications, supports early learning, and keeps local communities connected and informed will be cut off with regrettable and lasting consequences,\" said Patricia Harrison, president and CEO of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting.",

      "Both PBS and NPR have sued the Trump administration over previous executive orders cutting their funding, with lawyers for both alleging that among other issues, the cuts violate the First Amendment.",
      "PBS CEO Paula Kerger previously said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" that while PBS only receives 15% of its funding from the federal government, some of its smaller stations receive up to 50% of their funding from federal sources and said the risks to the smaller stations are \"existential\" if the funding is cut.",
      "NPR CEO Katherine Maher has said roughly 1% of the organization's budget comes directly from federal dollars.",
      "Some of the many impacted public radio and TV stations have posted messages protesting the proposed cuts in funding. The social media account of a Baltimore public radio station leader said, \"This isn't hypothetical\u2014it's real, it's happening, and it places the future of local, trusted public media at serious risk. Let me be clear: this is not a symbolic move. If approved, this action could irreparably damage the local public media.\"",
      "Rural communities, often referred to as \"news deserts\" because of the lack of local news organizations, would suffer the brunt of the pain. According to a joint statement by Rep.

      "The hearing",
      "Comer claimed state and local officials are \"actively undermining federal immigration enforcement,\" saying legislative action is needed to \"stop this subversion and stop the rule of law.\"",
      "\"Despite President Trump's efforts to secure the border and enforce the law, Democrat-run sanctuary cities and states are siding with illegal aliens,\" Comer said. \"For today's Democrat Party, it seems unlimited illegal immigration isn't a failure of policy \u2014 it is the policy.\"",
      "The committee's top Democrat, Rep. Stephen Lynch of Massachusetts, rebuked the Trump administration for its response to protests in L.A. in his opening statement, calling it \"thuggery.\"",

      "\"My views on immigration are simple and direct,\" Hochul said. \"Our nation needs secure borders. Our nation needs comprehensive immigration reform from this body. And our state laws dictate that we cooperate with ICE in criminal cases, and our values dictate that we treat all law-abiding people with dignity and respect.\"",
      "Pritzker said Illinois also stepped up to the challenge, and blamed the lack of federal intervention and cooperation from border states for exacerbating the problem.",
      "\"Illinois follows the law, but let me be clear, we expect the federal government to follow the law, too,\" Pritzker said. \"We will not participate in abuses of power.\"",

      "Washington \u2014 The CIA released a new batch of declassified documents surrounding the assassination of Robert F. Kennedy in 1968, acting on an executive order\u00a0that President Trump issued soon after taking office.",
      "\"The records reveal for the first time that Senator Kennedy shared his experiences traveling to the former Soviet Union with CIA, reflecting his patriotic commitment to serving his country,\" the CIA said in a statement accompanying the release.",
      "Kennedy was shot and killed by Sirhan Sirhan after the Democratic presidential primary in California in June 1968, four and a half years after President John F. Kennedy, his brother, was slain in Dallas. Sirhan, a Palestinian with Jordanian citizenship, said later that he killed RFK because of RFK's support for Israel in the Six-Day War in 1967.",
      "What's in the new files?",
      "The disclosure includes\u00a054 newly declassified documents\u00a0totaling 1,450 pages. They include news articles, dispatches from overseas CIA stations, intelligence reports on foreign officials, investigative updates and correspondence between the CIA and other agencies like the State Department and Department of Justice.",

      "One cable from June 29, 1968, showed officers in Sri Lanka reporting back to headquarters in Virginia about efforts to place favorable news coverage in a local newspaper to shape public opinion following the assassination. The article \"makes [the] point that America has no monopoly on violence\" and that China \"points a pious finger at America and expects the world to ignore the Mao-supported wave upon wave of violence unleashed by the Red Guards,\" the cable said.",

    "summary": "Medicaid cuts in the Trump tax bill could jeopardize 300 rural hospitals, risking service reductions or even closure, a report commissioned by Senate Democrats found.",
    "story": [
      "Cuts to federal spending on Medicaid could affect hundreds of rural hospitals in many states that have elected Republican senators and voted for President Trump, Senate Democrats warned Thursday, citing a list they commissioned tallying 338 rural hospitals at risk.",
      "\"If Republicans plan to pass drastic cuts to Medicaid and Medicare and effectively repeal the Affordable Care Act, communities should know exactly what they stand to lose,\" Sen. Ed Markey, the top Democrat in the Senate's health committee, said in a statement.",
      "The warning from Senate Democrats, outlined in a letter sent to President Trump and Republican congressional leaders, comes as senators are now wrestling with the budget package that Mr. Trump dubbed the \"big, beautiful bill,\" which narrowly passed the House last month.",
      "Budget analysts say a slew of changes that the House bill made to Medicaid provisions \u2014 which backers argue would target \"excesses and abuses\" in the program \u2014 could add up to reduced federal Medicaid spending by more than $800 billion over the next decade, resulting in 7.8 million more uninsured people.",
      "The American Hospital Association has warned Medicaid cuts being considered by Congress \"could have a devastating impact on rural hospitals,\" which often face larger shares of patients without health insurance.",
      "\"Rural hospitals serve as critical \u2014 and sometimes the sole \u2014 source of care for rural communities,\" the hospital lobbying group says.",
      "Democrats cited a list of at-risk rural hospitals that the University of North Carolina's Cecil G. Sheps Center for Health Services Research compiled at their request.",
      "\"If your party moves ahead with these drastic health care cuts that will cut millions of people off their health insurance coverage, rural hospitals will not get paid for the services they are required by law to provide to patients. In turn, rural hospitals will face deeper financial strain,\" the Democrats' letter states.",
      "The center analyzed data from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to compile a list of rural hospitals at the highest risk of financial distress, broken down by state and congressional district.",
      "\"Republican health care cuts would be felt by rural hospitals across the country. In Louisiana, 32 rural hospitals \u2014 or a majority of rural hospitals in the state \u2014 are serving a high concentration of Medicaid patients. A total of 33 hospitals are at risk based on serving a high share of Medicaid patients, experiencing negative total margins, or both,\" Democrats wrote.",
      "Louisiana is the home state of Sen. Bill Cassidy, the top Republican on the Senate health panel.",
      "The letter also itemized rural hospitals at risk in Alaska, Kentucky, West Virginia, Alabama and Tennessee.",
      "\"Substantial cuts to Medicaid or Medicare payments could increase the number of unprofitable rural hospitals and elevate their risk of financial distress. In response, hospitals may be forced to reduce service lines, convert to a different type of healthcare facility, or close altogether,\" wrote University of North Carolina researchers Mark Holmes, George Pink and Tyler Malone in their responses to the Democrats.",

    "summary": "HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. fired the previous roster of the CDC's vaccine advisers on Monday.",
    "story": [
      "Health and Human Services Secretary\u00a0Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced Wednesday he's naming eight new advisers to serve on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's vaccine recommendations committee, after firing the committee's entire previous roster of 17 advisers.",
      "\"All of these individuals are committed to evidence-based medicine, gold-standard science, and common sense. They have each committed to demanding definitive safety and efficacy data before making any new vaccine recommendations,\" Kennedy said Wednesday in a post on X.",
      "Kennedy's picks circumvented the usual CDC process for selecting members of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, known as ACIP. In previous administrations, career agency officials \u2014 not political leaders \u2014 vetted potential experts before forwarding them to the department for the secretary's approval.",
      "The panel's influential recommendations are closely watched because they are directly tied to federal policies, like which vaccines insurers are required to cover.",
      "The picks announced by Kennedy include some close allies of the secretary and his inner circle. Several have a history of criticizing vaccine recommendations or questioning their safety.",
      "\"The speed with which these members were selected, and the lack of transparency in the process, does not help to restore public confidence and trust, and contributes to confusion and uncertainty,\" Dr. Jason Goldman, president of the American College of Physicians, said in a statement.",
      "Here is a look at those named:",
      "Dr. Robert Malone",
      "One of the Kennedy allies named to the committee, Dr. Robert Malone, worked on early research related to mRNA vaccine technology but was accused during the COVID-19 pandemic of spreading misinformation about the mRNA vaccines. He was with Kennedy and President Trump at the Trump election night celebration in Florida.",
      "\"On the basis of data from all over the world, approximately three years ago it was my impression that the risk/benefit ratio of these products did not merit continued use in any cohort,\" Malone posted last month on his Substack about the mRNA COVID vaccines.",
      "Like Kennedy, Malone has questioned the benefits of measles vaccines during the recent record outbreak in Texas, which killed two children, and he has promoted unproven treatments for the virus.",
      "Dr. Martin Kulldorff",
      "Another member picked by Kennedy is Dr. Martin Kulldorff, an epidemiologist who co-authored the pandemic-era Great Barrington Declaration criticizing COVID-19 restrictions, along with now-NIH Director Dr. Jay Bhattacharya. Bhattacharya has described Kulldorff as a close friend.",
      "Kulldorff previously worked with the CDC's outside vaccine advisers, before authoring an opinion piece in 2021 criticizing the agency's decision to pause use of Johnson & Johnson's COVID-19 vaccine over safety concerns.",
      "He claimed he was fired from working with the committee over the opinion piece. Kulldorff later claimed he was fired from Harvard University for criticizing COVID-19 vaccine requirements.",
      "Dr. Cody Meissner",
      "Dr. Cody Meissner, a pediatrics professor who previously served as a member of the Food and Drug Administration's own vaccines panel \u2014 the Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee \u2014 was also named to the committee.",
      "Meissner opposed COVID-19 vaccine requirements for children. He also co-authored an opinion piece with now-FDA Commissioner Dr. Marty Makary speaking out against masking of children during the pandemic.",
      "Vicky Pebsworth, Ph.D., R.N.",
      "Vicky Pebsworth, a regional director of the National Association of Catholic Nurses, was also a former member of the FDA vaccines panel.",
      "Pebsworth spoke at a 2020 meeting of the FDA vaccines committee, where she identified herself as the research director for the National Vaccine Information Center and \"mother of a child injured by his 15-month well-baby shots in 1998.\" She said the center's position was that any \"coercion and sanctions to persuade adults to take an experimental vaccine, or give it to their children, is unethical and unlawful.\"",
      "Retsef Levi, Ph.D.",
      "Kennedy also praised another pick, MIT professor Retsef Levi, saying: \"Dr. Levi has collaborated with public health agencies to evaluate vaccine safety, including co-authoring studies on mRNA COVID-19 vaccines and their association with cardiovascular risks.\"",
      "Levi previously called for more detailed data from the COVID-19 vaccine trials, suggesting that changes to how Pfizer's shot was produced may have caused side effects.",
      "He\u00a0faced criticism\u00a0for a paper co-authored with Florida Surgeon General Dr. Joseph Ladapo, which was cited in the state's move to recommend that young men not get mRNA COVID-19 vaccines. Experts\u00a0condemned\u00a0the paper for misleading methods that could inflate the risk.",
      "Dr. Michael A. Ross",
      "Kennedy said Dr. Michael A. Ross \"contributed to national strategies for cancer prevention and early detection, including those involving HPV immunization,\" working with the CDC's breast and cervical cancer committee.",
      "Ross is described by Kennedy as an obstetrics and gynecology professor at George Washington University and Virginia Commonwealth University, though his name does not appear on directories for either university.",
      "\"Dr. Michael Ross has not held a faculty appointment at the George Washington University since 2017,\" Katelyn Deckelbaum, a spokesperson for the university, told CBS News in an email.",
      "Deckelbaum said that Ross was previously a clinical professor, but stopped teaching medical students or residents at the university.",
      "The investment firm Havencrest Capital Management lists Ross as a partner, and says he previously worked as an executive for India-based drugmaker Cadila Pharmaceutical. The firm said Ross is a pediatrics professor, not an obstetrics and gynecology professor.",
      "A spokesperson for HHS did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the discrepancies.",
      "Dr. James Pagano",
      "Dr. James Pagano, described by Kennedy as a \"strong advocate for evidence-based medicine,\" has published two fiction titles about hospital medicine.",
      "\"Over the course of his medical career he has worked in a number of emergency departments in the greater L.A. area, including major trauma centers as well as smaller community hospitals. He has been the medical director of one ER or another for many years,\" describes an Amazon listing for one of his books in 2012.",
      "A blog and X account with Pagano's name from several years ago wrote about a range of issues, like\u00a0voicing disappointment over Republicans failing to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, but says little about vaccines.",
      "Records from the Medical Board of California list Pagano as being retired.",
      "Dr. Joseph Hibbeln",
      "Another Kennedy pick, Dr. Joseph Hibbeln, retired from the National Institutes of Health in 2020. His research portfolio previously covered nutritional intake of fatty acids like omega-3. Kennedy described him as bringing \"expertise in immune-related outcomes, psychiatric conditions, and evidence-based public health strategies.\"",
      "Hibbeln previously co-authored a study probing whether exposure during pregnancy to mercury was linked to autism, in the wake of now-debunked research that falsely suggested a mercury-based preservative that was previously used in vaccines was causing autism.",
      "They concluded that there was \"no consistent evidence from this study to implicate prenatal exposure to mercury\" in causing autism, and that \"the benefits of nutrients in fish counteract any possible adverse cognitive and behavioral differences\" caused by mercury exposure.",
      "Kennedy's monthslong search for new members",
      "Kennedy's picks cap a monthslong search that the secretary and his aides have conducted for replacements to the committee.",
      "Former CDC official Jeffrey Klausner, a professor at the USC Keck School of Medicine, said he was among those approached for suggestions early this year.",
      "Klausner criticized Kennedy's pick of Malone, calling him a \"a well-known promoter of various conspiracy theories and was advocating for use of ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine in the treatment of COVID.\"",
      "\"Seems like his appointment is not consistent with some of Secretary Kennedy's public commitments,\" Klausner said.",
      "Kennedy told reporters on Monday that he was picking \"highly credentialed\" experts for the panel.",
      "\"We're going to bring people onto the ACIP panel, not anti-vaxxers, who are bringing people on who are credentialed scientists, who are highly credentialed physicians, who are going to do evidence-based medicine,\" he said.",
      "In an \"FAQ\" document shared with stakeholder groups, HHS said the department intended \"to ensure balanced membership in terms of the points of view represented.\"",

      "U.S. officials have been told Israel is fully ready to launch an operation into Iran, multiple sources told CBS News.",
      "The U.S. anticipates Iran could retaliate on certain American sites in neighboring Iraq. This is part of the reason the U.S. advised some Americans to leave the region earlier Wednesday. The State Department ordered non-emergency government officials to exit Iraq due to \"heightened regional tensions,\" and the Pentagon has authorized military family members to voluntarily leave locations throughout the Middle East, a defense official told CBS News.",
      "President Trump's Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff is still planning to meet with Iran for a sixth round of talks on the country's nuclear program in the coming days, two U.S. officials said.",
      "Mr. Trump spoke about Iran at an appearance at the Kennedy Center Wednesday evening, telling reporters Americans were advised to leave the region \"because it could be a dangerous place, and we'll see what happens.\" Mr. Trump also reiterated the U.S. did not want Iran to develop a nuclear weapon, saying: \"We're not going to allow that.\"",
      "When asked at the White House why dependents of military personnel were allowed to voluntarily leave the region, Mr. Trump said, \"You'll have to see.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Iran's Defense Minister Aziz Nasirzadeh told reporters Wednesday that if nuclear talks fail and \"a conflict is imposed on us,\" the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps \"will target all U.S. bases in the host countries.\"",
      "A source familiar with the situation and a U.S. official told CBS News that the Trump administration was weighing options regarding how to support Israeli military action without leading it. Those options could include aerial refueling or intelligence sharing, but the U.S. official was unaware of any commitment.",
      "The source familiar said the options are unlikely to include direct participation by U.S. B-2 bombers that carry the type of bombs that can penetrate Iran's deep underground fortified uranium enrichment facilities at Fordow and Natanz. Without that type of strike by U.S. B-2 bombers, it is unlikely Israeli military action could destroy the underground portions of Iran's program, and thus solo military action by Israel is presumed to be limited in its capability to fully eliminate the program.",
      "The U.S. official said the U.S. could help defend Israel against Iranian ballistic missiles in case of a counterattack, as it did during the two tit-for-tat episodes between Iran and Israel in\u00a0April 2024 and\u00a0October 2024.",
      "The U.K. Maritime Trade Organization on Wednesday advised ships to exercise caution in the Persian Gulf, Strait of Hormuz and Gulf of Oman \u2014 three key waterways for the global oil trade \u2014 due to \"increased tensions within the region which could lead to an escalation of military activity.\"",
      "Israeli officials and White House spokespeople declined to comment.",
      "The Trump administration has sought a deal with Iran to limit the country's nuclear program, as international watchdogs say the country has continued to enrich uranium to near-weapons level. The talks are delicate, and it's unclear how close the two sides are to a deal: Mr. Trump has said he will not accept any uranium enrichment by Iran, but Iranian leaders have indicated they won't accept those terms, the president said earlier this week.",
      "For years, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has been deeply skeptical of any deal with Iran. The two countries have been nemeses since Iran's 1979 revolution. Netanyahu's office says Israel has conducted \"countless overt and covert operations\" to stunt the growth of Iran's nuclear program.",
      "Last month, Mr. Trump said publicly he had urged Netanyahu not to strike Iran while his administration pursues negotiations with the regime.",
      "\"I told him this would be inappropriate to do right now because we're very close to a solution,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "Iran's nuclear program dates back decades, though the country has long insisted the program is only intended for peaceful purposes.",
      "In 2015, former President Barack Obama struck a deal with Iran limiting the scope of the country's uranium enrichment program, over the objections of Netanyahu, who alleged Iran is unreliable and had covertly violated the agreement. Mr. Trump exited the agreement during his first term and ratcheted up sanctions against Iran, while the Middle Eastern country expanded its stockpile of highly enriched uranium.",
      "In a report two weeks ago, the International Atomic Energy Agency estimated Iran had enriched 408.6 kilograms of uranium up to 60% purity \u2014 which is very close to the 90% enrichment level required to build a nuclear weapon. That's a significant jump from the 274.8-kilogram stockpile the United Nations agency had estimated in February.",
      "In testimony on Capitol Hill earlier Wednesday, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said, \"There are plenty of indications that they have been moving their way towards something that would look a lot like a nuclear weapon.\"",

    "summary": "President Trump will host lawmakers Thursday from both parties for the annual congressional picnic on the South Lawn.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump said Republican Sen. Rand Paul and his family are welcome to attend the annual congressional picnic at the White House, reversing course after Paul said the \"incredibly petty\" White House rescinded his invitation over his opposition to the GOP-backed budget bill.",
      "The president is scheduled to host members of Congress from both parties and their families Thursday, an annual tradition that takes place on the South Lawn. Paul told reporters on Capitol Hill on Wednesday that the White House had disinvited him.",
      "\"I think I'm the first senator in the history of the United States to be uninvited to the White House picnic,\" Paul told reporters. \"Every Democrat will be invited, every Republican will be invited, but I will be the only one disallowed to come on the grounds of the White House.\"",
      "Paul said he had planned to bring his wife, son, daughter-in-law and 6-month-old grandson to the event, but learned that they were no longer invited when he went to claim their tickets.",
      "\"I just find this incredibly petty,\" Paul said. \"The level of immaturity is beyond words.\"",
      "\"They've decided they want to declare war on my family and exclude us from the White House,\" he added, saying he was given no explanation. \"We're just not welcome.\"",
      "Mr. Trump responded on Thursday, writing on Truth Social that Paul would be invited after all.",
      "\"Of course Senator Rand Paul and his beautiful wife and family are invited to the BIG White House Party tonight. He's the toughest vote in the history of the U.S. Senate, but why wouldn't he be?\" the president wrote. \"Besides, it gives me more time to get his Vote on the Great, Big, Beautiful Bill.\"",
      "Paul has been critical of Republicans' sweeping policy bill\u00a0aimed at advancing Mr. Trump's second-term agenda because it would raise the debt ceiling by trillions of dollars. He has said he could be convinced to support the package if the debt ceiling provision is removed and voted on separately.",
      "The senator accused the White House of running a \"paid influencer campaign\" against him on social media in recent weeks as he's expressed his dissatisfaction with the legislation and said Republicans will be to blame for the debt levels.",
      "\"I'm arguing from a true belief and worry that our country is mired in debt and getting worse, and they choose to react by uninviting my grandson to the picnic,\" he said. \"It really makes me lose a lot of respect I once had for Donald Trump.\"",
      "Paul said the behavior shows \"they don't care about my vote at all.\"",
      "\"They're afraid of what I'm saying, so they think they're going to punish me. I can't go to the picnic. As if somehow that's going to make me more conciliatory,\" he said. \"Petty vindictiveness like this \u2026 it makes you wonder about the quality of people you're dealing with.\"",
      "Several other Republican lawmakers have also laid out their red lines for the legislation. It's unclear if any other members of Congress who were planning to attend the picnic had their invitations rescinded.",

    "published": "Thu, 12 Jun 2025 08:00:00 -0400",
    "summary": "In 2022, President Biden signed a law requiring a plaque honoring police who protected the Capitol be installed by March 2023.",
    "story": [
      "Two police officers who defended the Capitol during the Jan. 6, 2021 attack filed a federal civil lawsuit, asking a judge to order the hanging of a plaque to honor police heroes who protected the Capitol, lawmakers and staff from rioters.",
      "The lawsuit cites a 2022 law signed by President Biden that required the honorary plaque be hung by March 2023. The plaque has been completed and in storage since at least last year, but GOP House Speaker Mike Johnson\u00a0has not committed to installing it at the Capitol.",
      "The dispute over the plaque has angered victims and inflamed a politically divisive issue on Capitol Hill. Republican leaders, who control the administration of the Capitol complex, have not honored requests by some officers and Democratic colleagues to hang the plaque, as required under federal law.",
      "In their lawsuit, former Capitol Police Officer Harry Dunn and D.C. Metropolitan Police Officer Daniel Hodges argue President Trump has spun conspiracy theories about Jan. 6, that have been adopted by his Republican allies in Congress.",
      "\"After Congress passed the law, the politics of January 6 began to change. Donald Trump began to call the attack on the Capitol a 'day of love,' and said that 'the cops should be charged and the protesters should be freed,\" the lawsuit said. \"As Trump's political fortunes rebounded, elected officials began to parrot his claims about the day.\"",
      "The lawsuit argues the failure to hang the plaque violates the Equal Protection clause of the Constitution. It also contends the Aarchitect of the Capitol, who helps manage the facilities and grounds of the Capitol, has failed to complete a required duty under the 2022 law.",
      "\"There seems to be no indication that congressional leadership is going to install this without judicial intervention,\" said attorney Brendan Ballou, who has helped with crafting the lawsuit.. Ballou, a former Justice Department prosecutor who handled Jan. 6 criminal cases and resigned from the agency earlier this year, also told CBS News, \"Congress was required by law to install this plaque to honor the officers that defended the Capitol and those inside on Jan. 6. They have not done so, and they have not done so two years past the legal deadline.\"",
      "In the civil lawsuit, the officers argue, \"While Congress has installed a memorial to other officers who died in a different tragedy, it has not installed the plaque to honor those who defended the Capitol on January 6. Meanwhile, though Congress has not installed the memorial to the officers who defended it, members have managed to honor the man who inspired the violence.\"",
      "\"Since President Trump's inauguration, bills have been introduced to make his birthday a federal holiday, to rename Dulles International Airport after him, to put his face on the $100 bill (or to create a new $250 bill in his honor), and to carve his face into Mount Rushmore,\" the lawsuit said.",
      "It's been filed in the U.S. District Court of the District of Columbia, where more than 1,500 Capitol riot criminal cases were filed. A judge has not yet been assigned, from among the nearly two dozen federal judges on the D.C. federal court.",
      "For now, the plaque remains in storage on the Capitol grounds, according to multiple sources who spoke with CBS News. The delay in hanging the plaque has fueled broader disputes and anger over Trump's controversial pardons of more than 1,500 Capitol riot defendants, and the lack of statements by Republican House members commemorating the four-year mark of the assault on the Capitol in January.",
      "In a statement during a service honoring police in May, Rep. Dan Goldman, a New York Democrat, said the plaque \"is still sitting in storage because Republican leadership refuses to act. Until they condemn these pardons and honor these officers, their hollow words of support for law enforcement are meaningless.\"",
      "Rep. Joe Morelle, a New York Democrat who is the ranking member on the Committee on House Administration, has pushed unsuccessfully to get the the plaque installed.",
      "A spokesperson for the\u00a0 Johnson did not immediately return requests for comment from CBS News. Johnson has been previously pressed by reporters and colleagues about the delay in hanging the plaque, but has remained silent on a timeline for hanging the honorary marker.",

    "summary": "Sen. Elizabeth Warren is urging President Trump to \"reverse course\" on the Department of Government Efficiency's efforts to cut government spending and agencies.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts is urging President Trump to \"reverse course\" on the Department of Government Efficiency's efforts to cut government spending and agencies, advocating instead that he implement her policy proposals to find savings, days after a split between Elon Musk and the president spilled into public view.",
      "\"Although Mr. Musk and DOGE have failed at achieving their purported savings goals, you could choose to end this government waste while avoiding dangerous cuts to important federal Programs,\" Warren wrote in a letter to Mr. Trump along with Rep. Melanie Stansbury of New Mexico, the top Democrat on the House DOGE subcommittee. \"You should learn from Elon Musk and DOGE's mistakes, end your attacks on critical federal programs, and instead act on these recommendations.\"",
      "The Democrats penned a letter to Mr. Trump outlining \"DOGE's failures,\" along with recommendations that they said would save the U.S. more than $2 trillion over 10 years. The letter, obtained exclusively by CBS News, follows a letter Warren wrote to Musk in January, outlining the 30 recommendations.",
      "\"Mr. Musk ignored these recommendations \u2014 but you could choose to reverse course, abandon Mr. Musk's inefficient and harmful DOGE actions, and instead carefully review and implement our policy proposals,\" the lawmakers wrote.",
      "Musk initially pledged to cut $2 trillion of government spending, but later lowered the benchmark to $1 trillion. Ultimately, the White House said DOGE's efforts saved roughly $170 billion in spending. But that figure has been disputed, with a number of errors and miscalculations on the initiative's \"wall of receipts.\" Musk said he expected the DOGE cuts would achieve the $1 trillion goal \"over time.\"",
      "Warren's suggestions include cracking down on prescription drug middlemen known as Pharmacy Benefit Managers; eliminating waste, fraud, and abuse in federal charter school programs and ending support for-profit schools; reforming the estate tax exemption; negotiating better Defense Department contracts; and ending practices surrounding \"unnecessary federal arrests.\"",
      "\"It is time to eliminate the real waste, fraud, and abuse in government spending, rather than ravaging programs that keep Americans safe, secure, and healthy just to pay for tax cuts for billionaires and large corporations,\" Warren and Stansbury said.",
      "The letter comes after Musk's opposition to a massive budget bill central to enacting the president's agenda erupted into a dramatic and public feud between him and Mr. Trump last week. The spat marked a swift turnaround, coming one week after Mr. Trump gifted Musk a key to the White House as the world's richest man wrapped up his time in the federal government.",
      "Despite the public blowup, administration officials told CBS News last week that there had been no efforts to oust officials who came from Musk's orbit. And the White House's top trade adviser, Peter Navarro, praised DOGE's work in recent days, while expressing doubt that the feud would affect its continued efforts.",
      "\"Waste, fraud and abuse, unfortunately, is alive and well in America, and the DOGE folks here, they're good folks,\" Navarro told reporters at the White House Friday. \"When you work with them and bring to them the institutional knowledge of how bureaucracies work and what's important in a bureaucracy and what's not, when you wed to that, it's a great thing. So, we're happy.\"",
      "Musk expressed some remorse for the spat on X on Wednesday, after deleting some of the most inflammatory posts days earlier.",
      "\"I regret some of my posts about President @realDonaldTrump last week,\" Musk said. \"They went too far.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The House is expected to vote Thursday on the White House's rescission package \u2014 its formal request to claw back funding for NPR, PBS and international aid that lawmakers had previously approved.",
      "The package would cancel $9.4 billion appropriated by Congress, looking to make permanent some of the Department of Government Efficiency's spending cuts. Its primary focus is slashing foreign aid \u2014 from peacekeeping efforts to refugee assistance and climate projects \u2014 but it would also essentially cut off federal funding for NPR and PBS.",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, touted the request to cancel what he called \"wasteful spending\" in recent days, calling it a \"manifestation of the DOGE effort,\" adding that it would \"ensure greater accountability in government going forward.\"",
      "The rescissions package includes $1.1 billion in cuts for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which provides funding to NPR and PBS. The White House has targeted the entities, claiming they have \"spread radical, woke propaganda disguised as 'news.'\" PBS received $325 million in CPB funding this year.",
      "Johnson said of NPR and PBS that funding them is an outmoded idea because \"we're in a different era now.\"",
      "\"There is no reason for any media organization to be singled out to receive federal funds,\" Johnson said. \"Especially those who appear to have so little regard for the truth.\"",
      "The package would cut $8.3 billion for the United States Agency for International Development, or USAID, among other international assistance programs, after the foreign aid agency became an early target of the administration. Johnson said the resolution would make cuts in what he called the \"USAID abuses area.\"",
      "Johnson said DOGE \"went after USAID first for their review, their audits,\" because USAID \"opposed the loudest of this accountability measure,\" claiming they \"put the scrutiny targets on their own backs.\"",
      "But some of the cuts have sparked objections among Republican lawmakers, like cuts to a program aimed at combatting HIV and AIDS globally. The President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, or PEPFAR, was started by former President George W. Bush, and has been credited for saving millions of lives around the world. Rep. Don Bacon, a Nebraska Republican, told The New York Times he would oppose the rescissions package because of these cuts, though he seemed to warm to the package this week, telling reporters he feels \"better\" about the cuts to the program after the House GOP conference met Tuesday. But he wouldn't say how he planned to vote on the measure.",
      "Other Republicans, like Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, have voiced concerns as well.",
      "\"PEPFAR cuts make no sense to me whatsoever, given the extraordinary record of PEPFAR in saving lives,\" Collins told reporters last week, while pointing to several other global health care programs targeted in the rescissions package. \"So, I have a lot of concerns.\"",
      "But Republican leaders in Congress were bullish about the path forward.",
      "House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, a Louisiana Republican, said Tuesday that \"our members are ready to go lock in some of those DOGE cuts,\" adding that \"this is a start \u2014 it's a good start, it's an important first step and we're going to take it on Thursday.\"",
      "Johnson said the vote on the package \"is an important signal \u2014 House Republicans are serious about getting our fiscal house in order, and we'll do that.\"",
      "The rescissions process",
      "Congress can cancel funds that the federal government has not yet spent but has previously appropriated under the rescissions process. Each year, Congress approves funding to keep the federal government running before the funds are disbursed to government agencies and programs. The president can temporarily defer funds or withhold them altogether \u2014 but only with Congress' approval.",
      "The White House's official transmission of the rescission package on June 3 started the clock on a process that gives Congress 45 days to act. Rescissions requests first go before relevant committees for consideration, before moving to the full House and Senate for votes. In the Senate, rescission bills are not subject to the 60-vote threshold needed to advance most legislation in the upper chamber and only require a simple majority.",

    "summary": "Activist David Hogg will leave the Democratic Party's leadership, saying he will not run in a planned redo of this year's DNC vice chair elections.",
    "story": [
      "Activist David Hogg is exiting his role as Democratic National Committee vice chair, he said Wednesday, after months of controversy sparked by his plan to back primary challenges against Democrats he claims are \"asleep at the wheel.\"",
      "Hogg announced he will not run in a planned redo of this year's DNC vice chair elections, shortly after the party voted to void Hogg and Malcolm Kenyatta's victories in the DNC's vice chair elections earlier this year. The revote is not related to Hogg's push to primary elected Democrats, but it came after Hogg drew stiff criticism over the plan.",
      "\"It is clear that there is a fundamental disagreement about the role of a Vice Chair \u2014 and it's okay to have disagreements. What isn't okay is allowing this to remain our focus when there is so much more we need to be focused on,\" Hogg said in a statement issued through his political action committee, Leaders We Deserve. \"Ultimately, I have decided to not run in this upcoming election so the party can focus on what really matters. I need to do this work with Leaders We Deserve, and it is going to remain my number one mission to build the strongest party possible.\"",
      "DNC Chair Ken Martin said in a statement, \"I commend David for his years of activism, organizing and fighting for his generation, and while I continue to believe he is a powerful voice for this party, I respect his decision to step back from his post as Vice Chair.\"",
      "Hogg, 25, rose to fame after he survived the deadly 2018 Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School shooting and helped lead the March for Our Lives movement in support of gun control legislation. He was elected to one of the DNC's vice chair positions earlier this year.",
      "Months after taking on the role, Hogg and his group called Leaders We Deserve touted an effort to \"start primarying out-of-touch, ineffective House Democrats in solid blue seats (not frontline districts) who are failing to meet the moment as part of a $20 million initiative to elect young leaders and bring about generational change in the Democratic Party.\"",
      "The move came as Democrats \u2014 stung by last year's presidential defeat and hobbled as the minority party in both chambers of Congress \u2014 debate how best to push back against President Trump.",
      "But Hogg's announcement was met with outcry from some Democratic heavyweights who believe party leaders should stay neutral in primaries and focus on ousting elected Republicans. Martin, who won his role the same day Hogg was elected as a vice chair, told reporters in April that \"no DNC officer should ever attempt to influence the outcome of a primary election \u2014 whether on behalf of an incumbent or a challenger.\"",
      "Matt Bennett, a campaign aide to former President Bill Clinton who now works for the centrist group Third Way, called it \"insane behavior from a DNC official.\"",
      "Hogg has defended the Leaders We Deserve initiative, telling CBS News' Major Garrett in April, \"We have to show our base right now that we are doing everything we can to fight back against Donald Trump, and that includes holding ourselves accountable.\"",
      "Hogg's future as a DNC vice chair has been in question for weeks as concerns about him within the party appeared to grow, and the infighting troubled an array of important people within the party.",
      "The challenge to Hogg's Feb. 1 election as a DNC vice chair, made well before the standoff between him and party officials began in April, moved forward in recent weeks as pushback and controversy enveloped the young leader just months into his tenure with the national party.",
      "The challenge from this winter, which eventually led to Wednesday's move for new elections for Hogg and fellow vice chair Kenyatta's party offices, was brought by Kalyn Free of Oklahoma, who argued she lost the vice chair race because the party didn't follow the proper rules. The complaint claimed that \"the decision to ignore the Charter, Bylaws and upend the stated Election Rules in conducting the election for the second and third Vice Chair positions gave the two male candidates an unfair and insurmountable advantage over the women candidates.\"",
      "While the election challenge was never about Hogg's controversies, the two became tied together publicly at a difficult time for the party. Reeling from losses in the 2024 presidential election and nationwide branding issues, Democrats were determined to start rebuilding. But the tensions between Hogg and party leaders loomed over that work publicly, and were used by some within the GOP to criticize the Democratic Party as the drama played out.",
      "Now, Democrats are expected to try and move past this period of intraparty fighting that has troubled them during the first year of President Trump's second term in office. Had Hogg tried to remain vice chair, he would have faced Kenyatta in a race for one vice chair role, with the loser then being eligible to run against several challengers for another vice chair slot.",
      "\"I look forward to getting back to work electing Democrats up and down the ballot,\" Kenyatta said in a statement about Wednesday's news. \"I wish David the best.\"",

      "The Environmental Protection Agency announced Wednesday that it will seek to revoke a key rule put in place by the Biden administration that set limits on the amount of carbon dioxide, a major greenhouse gas that contributes to climate change, emitted from fossil fuel-fired power plants.",
      "The rule was finalized in April 2024 and is projected to reduce 1.38 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide from entering the atmosphere by 2047, as well as eliminate tens of thousands of tons of other harmful air pollutants that are dangerous to public health. Eliminating 1.38 billion metric tons of carbon emissions is equivalent to driving more than 320 million gas-powered cars for a year, according to an EPA estimate.",
      "At a news conference Wednesday, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin said the Trump administration is demonstrating that it \"can both protect the environment and grow the economy.\"",
      "\"Today is a historic day at the EPA,\" he said. \"For the last few months, since President Trump was sworn in for this term, we here at the EPA have been taking actions to end the agency's war on so much of our U.S. domestic energy supply.\"",
      "In the\u00a0EPA's published announcement, it also said it will work to publish a finding that greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuel power plants \"do not contribute significantly to dangerous air pollution.\" But\u00a0EPA data shows that in 2023, the power sector produced 31% of carbon emissions from burning fossil fuels, the second-highest of all industries.",
      "Former Obama EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy, disagreed with Zeldin, saying in a statement, \"The key rationale Zeldin is using to justify the dismantling of our nation's protections from power plant pollution is absolutely illogical and indefensible. It's purely a political play that goes against decades of science and policy review.\"",
      "Zeldin also announced that the agency will move to repeal updated limits to the Mercury and Air Toxic Standards rule, which restricts the amount of pollutants that can be emitted by coal and natural gas-fired power plants. The rule was first introduced in 2011, but the Biden administration tightened the regulations in 2024 to ensure that fossil fuel plants reduce emissions from toxic metals by 67% and from mercury by 70%.",
      "Now, the EPA plans to loosen those more stringent standards, which Zeldin said are \"gratuitous.\"",
      "Although mercury is naturally occurring in nature, exposure to high levels of it in the air, water and food supply is toxic to human health and especially dangerous to the development of young children and fetuses, according to the World Health Organization. When mercury is released into the air, it can travel great distances and land in lakes and rivers, where it is exposed to fish that can be eaten by humans.",
      "The rule has been highly effective, reducing mercury air emissions from power plants by 85% from 2013-2022. A big part of that shift was driven by a decline in coal plants and by installing pollution controls on fossil fuel-based power generation.",
      "Zeldin was joined by several Republican members of the House and Senate, including Sen. Kevin Cramer of North Dakota, who applauded the announcement as a \"common-sense\" change.",
      "\"What's been done up to this point is literally a unilateral disarmament of the American economy,\" he said.",
      "The rollbacks support President Trump's executive order, \"Unleashing American Energy,\" and its mission to review policies that might \"impose an undue burden on \u2026 domestic energy resources.\"",
      "But critics of the announcement, including many environmentalists, say the economic and health benefits of the Biden-era rules outweigh the cost of compliance and the rollbacks could be dangerous.",
      "\"The EPA is hoisting the white flag of surrender on the power plant pollution that's poisoning the air we breathe and harming our climate,\" said Manish Bapna in a statement, president and CEO of the Natural Resources Defense Council. \"What's more, EPA is trying to repeal toxic air pollution standards for the nation's dirtiest coal plants, allowing the worst actors to keep poisoning the air.\"",
      "The Environmental Protection Network, a group of hundreds of former EPA employees, did an analysis of EPA data to estimate the health and economic impact of both rules. It found that the Biden-era power plant pollution and mercury rules, combined, could avoid the premature mortality of more than 15,000 people and prevent more than 5.1 million symptomatic asthma incidents, cumulatively through 2050. The two rules are estimated to provide more than $22.4 billion in annual net benefits for public health and the economy by reducing hospital and health care costs.",
      "Zeldin said that if the EPA finalizes new rules, power plants will not be allowed to emit more than they do today, which does not reflect the Biden-era standards because they had not been implemented yet. The EPA estimates its proposed rules will save the power sector roughly $1.2 billion a year in regulatory costs.",
      "Some environmental groups say they are prepared to sue the EPA over the rollbacks.",
      "\"If EPA proceeds with repealing these life-saving standards based on a legal theory that doesn't pass the laugh test, our lawyers are ready to defend the public's right to breathe in court,\" Meredith Hankins, a senior attorney at the Natural Resources Defense Council, said in a statement.",

    "published": "Wed, 11 Jun 2025 11:00:14 -0400",
    "summary": "Apex predators, like the Tyrannosaurus rex, eventually arose from smaller-bodied tyrannosauroid dinosaurs called Khankhuuluu mongoliensis, the study's researchers said.",
    "story": [
      "More than 85 million years ago, a smaller-bodied ancestor of the Tyrannosaurus rex roamed the plains of Mongolia. The dinosaur's identity was unknown \u2014 until now.",
      "In a study\u00a0published Wednesday in Nature, scientists describe the identification of a new tyrannosauroid named Khankhuuluu mongoliensis. Apex predators, including the T. rex, eventually arose from these smaller-bodied tyrannosauroids, the study's researchers said.",
      "\"This species, Khankhuuluu, is the missing link between smaller and earlier forms and the larger apex predatory tyrannosaurs,\" paleontologist Darla Zelenitsky, a professor at the University of Calgary and study co-author, told CBS News.",
      "The Khankhuuluu's skeleton was discovered in Mongolia in the Gobi Desert in 1972 or 1973, but wasn't studied scientifically until a few years later, Zelenitsky said. The remains were identified by Mongolian paleontologist Altangerel Perle as Alectrosaurus olsoni, another obscure species. After it was misidentified, the bones became part of a museum collection and were relatively untouched for almost 50 years.",
      "Referred to as mid-grade tyrannosauroids, these smaller-bodied predators were evolutionary intermediates, the study found. During the period when Khankhuuluu lived in Mongolia, the tyrannosaurs began growing larger and taking on the features of apex predators. Not much else is known about these elusive tyrannosauroids due to fragmentary fossil remains, but researchers said the dinosaurs weighed around 1,700 pounds. They were one of the larger predators in the ecosystem at the time.",
      "\"It's essentially the immediate ancestor of the tyrannosaur family,\" Zelenitsky said.",
      "A surprise discovery",
      "University of Calgary postdoctoral scholar and study co-author Jared Voris traveled to Mongolia a few years earlier to research the bones of various tyrannosaurs and, in the process, gained access to see the bones of what they would later determine are the Khankhuuluu.",
      "Voris thought the remains could be something important, as he often saw references to the specimens pop up, but after he started examining the bones, he knew it could be something special. While studying the individual characteristics of the bones, one of the things he noticed was that the Khankhuuluu's teeth couldn't crush bone, Voris said, a defining characteristic of the larger apex predatory Tyrannosaurus.",
      "\"This animal had features we had never seen before in more of our iconic tyrannosaurs,\" Voris said.",
      "He texted Zelenitsky from Mongolia that he \"thought it could be a new species.\" Zelenitsky said she responded, \"I said, great going, keep looking at this so we can be sure this is a new species.\"",
      "The two paleontologists aren't new to groundbreaking scientific discoveries \u2014 they've had several.\u00a0In 2023, Zelenitsky was part of a team that identified a Tyrannosaurus fossil with a meal in its stomach, and Voris discovered a new species of tyrannosaurid dinosaur, Thanatotheristes degrootorum \u2014 whose genus name translates to \"Reaper of Death.\"",
      "\"Rewriting a family history of tyrannosaurs\"",
      "These Asian tyrannosauroids eventually crossed over into North America using a northern land bridge between Alaska and Siberia, Zelenitsky said. Dinosaurs used these land bridges, which appeared periodically over the past 100 million years, to travel between Asia and North America.",
      "And from it, these tyrannosauroids evolved and morphed into apex predators. T. rex is the\u00a0deadliest land predator\u00a0ever to live, and there has long been a fascination with the dinosaur that has been extinct for about 66 million years.",
      "The study co-authors said the new identification shows there are still big discoveries to be made in science. \"What really started just as a discovery of a new species ended up with us kind of rewriting a family history of tyrannosaurs,\" Zelenitsky said.",

      "The Joro spider, Asian long-horned beetle and spotted lanternfly have company this summer.",
      "A \"sneaky\" invasive species that has a potentially deadly sting continues to spread across the U.S. and can be found in more than a dozen states, according to experts.",
      "Asian needle ants were first detected in the U.S. almost a century ago, but the species has continued to expand its reach, primarily throughout the Southeast, and this pest could potentially be deadly to humans, according to Dan Suiter, a professor of urban entomology at the University of Georgia.",
      "\"It injects venom that can harm you. Its sting can be life threatening,\" Suiter recently told the university.",
      "Suiter added that people who have adverse reactions to bee and ant stings are especially vulnerable and could go into anaphylactic shock from the needle ant's sting. Anaphylaxis is a potentially life-threatening allergic reaction that can occur within seconds of being exposed to something you're allergic to, such as a sting, according to the Mayo Clinic.",
      "\"If you suffer from anaphylaxis, you should really know what this ant looks like,\" Suiter says. \"And it might be smart to carry an EpiPen.\"",
      "Suiter urged people to be vigilant for these invasive species, especially with ant populations peaking later this summer.",
      "What are Asian needle ants?",
      "Asian needle ants are technically known as Brachyponera chinensis\u00a0\u2014 roughly translated as \"short, wicked ant from China\" \u2014 but their native range also includes Japan and the Koreas, according to the U.S. Forest Service.",
      "The insect was first discovered in the U.S. in 1932 in Georgia, but has only recently started to \"cause problems in North America after being relatively unnoticed for many years,\" the U.S. Forest Service says.",
      "The pest has now been detected all the way from Washington state to Florida, according to the site\u00a0antmaps.org as well as Mississippi State University, and the ant is recently getting more attention in Texas.",
      "Suiter says Asian needle ants are \"sneaky\" because they are less than a quarter of an inch long and are adept at hiding.",
      "\"Unlike many invasive species that tend to colonize areas in the wake of natural or human disturbance, Asian needle ants are capable of invading undisturbed forest areas where they nest under and within logs and other debris, under stones, and in leaf litter,\" the U.S. Forest Service says.",
      "Environmental impacts",
      "According to Suiter, Asian needle ants wreak havoc in native environments.",
      "\"They outcompete other ant species that are important to the ecology of that area,\" he says.",
      "Asian needle ants prey on other insects and are capable of displacing ant species that are critical for seed dispersal, according to the U.S. Forest Service. Researchers have documented large decreases in seed dispersal in forests where Asian needle ants are present.",
      "\"Thus, this invasive species could have dramatic, long-term negative effects on forest understory,\" the service says.",
      "What should people do if they see Asian needle ants?",
      "Asian needle ants are about 0.2 inches in length, and dark brown or black with the end of the antennae and the legs being a lighter orange-brown, the U.S. Forest Service says. Other ant species can look similar, \"so it takes an experienced eye to positively identify them,\" the service says.",
      "Suiter says that you can send a photograph or a specimen to a local University of Georgia Extension office, which can help with identification. The public can also contact a professional to come out and bait for the ants, he says.",
      "The U.S. Forest Service advises people to avoid the pest and to be especially vigilant in areas with logs, rotting wood or rocks where the ants can nest.",
      "\"Unfortunately, as with many invasive species, it appears Asian needle ants are here to stay,\" the service says.",

    "summary": "NASA wants to evaluate recent efforts to stop a small but persistent air leak in the Russian segment of the space station.",
    "story": [
      "Concern about a small but persistent air leak in a Russian compartment of the International Space Station has prompted NASA and Axiom Space to indefinitely delay this week's launch of a commercial flight to the orbiting outpost, officials said Thursday.",
      "The privately-financed Axiom-4 crew \u2014 commander Peggy Whitson, Indian pilot Shubhanshu Shukla, Polish researcher S\u0142awosz Uzna\u0144ski-Wi\u015bniewski and Hungarian engineer Tibor Kapu \u2014 originally planned to take off Tuesday.",
      "But the flight was delayed to the end of the week, first by high winds in the off-shore emergency splashdown zone and then by an oxygen leak in their Falcon 9 rocket's first stage. SpaceX tentatively targeted Thursday and then Friday for launch, with Saturday and Sunday available if needed.",
      "But during SpaceX troubleshooting to find and fix the rocket's propellant leak, NASA engineers decided they needed more time to assess recent efforts to plug an air leak aboard the International Space Station in a Russian vestibule known as the PrK. The PrK serves as a passageway between the station's Zvezda module and spacecraft docked at its aft port.",
      "\"Teams met today and we will not be launching Axiom-4 tomorrow,\" flight controllers in Houston radioed the ISS. \"We are assessing a new launch date. This is due to the ongoing PrK investigation. So I don't have a new launch date right now, but we will not be launching tomorrow and docking Saturday.\"",
      "In a blog post, NASA said cosmonauts aboard the station \"recently performed inspections of the pressurized module's interior surfaces, sealed some additional areas of interest, and measured the current leak rate. Following this effort, the segment now is holding pressure.\"",
      "The post went on to say  the Axiom-4 delay will provide \"additional time for NASA and (the Russian space agency) Roscosmos to evaluate the situation and determine whether any additional troubleshooting is necessary.\"",
      "Launched in July 2000 atop a Russian Proton rocket, Zvezda was the third module to join the growing space station, providing a command center for Russian cosmonauts, crew quarters, the aft docking port and two additional ports now occupied by airlock and research modules.",
      "The leakage was first noticed in 2019, and has been openly discussed ever since by NASA during periodic reviews and space station news briefings. The leak rate has varied, but has stayed in the neighborhood of around 1-to-2 pounds per day.",
      "\"The station is not young,\" astronaut Mike Barratt said last November during a post flight news conference. \"It's been up there for quite a while, and you expect some wear and tear, and we're seeing that in the form of some cracks that have formed.\"",
      "The Russians have made a variety of attempts to patch a suspect crack and other possible sources of leakage, but air has continued to escape into space.",
      "In November, Bob Cabana, a former astronaut and NASA manager who chaired the agency's ISS Advisory Committee, said U.S. and Russian engineers \"don't have a common understanding of what the likely root cause is, or the severity of the consequences of these leaks.\"",
      "\"The Russian position is that the most probable cause of the PrK cracks is high cyclic fatigue caused by micro vibrations,\" Cabana said. \"NASA believes the PrK cracks are likely multi-causal including pressure and mechanical stress, residual stress, material properties and environmental exposures.",
      "\"The Russians believe that continued operations are safe, but they can't prove to our satisfaction that they are, and the US believes that it's not safe, but we can't prove that to the Russian satisfaction that that's the case.\"",
      "As an interim step, the hatch leading to the PrK and the station's aft docking compartment is closed during daily operations and only opened when the Russians need to unload a visiting Progress cargo ship.",
      "And as an added precaution on NASA's part, whenever the hatch to the PrK and docking compartment is open, a hatch between the Russian and U.S. segments of the station is closed.",
      "\"We've taken a very conservative approach to close a hatch between the US side and the Russian side during those time periods,\" Barratt said. \"It's not a comfortable thing, but it is the best agreement between all the smart people on both sides. And it's something that we crew live with and enact.\"",
      "Cabana said last year that the Russians do not believe \"catastrophic disintegration of the PrK is realistic (but) NASA has expressed concerns about the structural integrity of the PrK and the possibility of a catastrophic failure.\"",

      "Arsia Mons, which dwarfs Earth's tallest volcanoes, and its two neighboring volcanoes are often surrounded by water ice clouds, especially in the early morning. The image released Friday marks the first time one of the volcanoes has been imaged on the planet's horizon, NASA said.",
      "Odyssey has previously captured high-altitude images of the Martian horizon, and to do so, it rotates 90 degrees while in orbit so that its camera can take the picture, NASA said. The spacecraft typically focuses on the upper atmosphere but also studies surface features.",
      "The latest image, captured on May 2, focuses on Arsia Mons, which is roughly twice as tall as Earth's largest volcano, Hawaii's Mauna Loa, which rises 6 miles above the seafloor.",
      "Arsia Mons is the cloudiest of the three volcanoes in the area -- collectively called the Tharsis Mountains -- and the clouds are especially thick when the Red Planet is farthest from the sun, a period called aphelion.",
      "The new snapshot clearly shows the cloud canopy across the Red Planet's equator.",

      "For more than a decade, Tribeca has been expanding its focus beyond cinema and television to include new avenues of storytelling through the use of virtual reality, augmented reality, and other nascent technologies, producing some vivid immersive displays. Even if the storytelling aspect of the programs were limited, the artistic expressions could be powerful. This was especially true with past exhibits that enveloped the viewer in massive spaces, in which computer-generated imagery or time-lapse photography placed the viewer in new worlds, from exploding galaxies to swirling blood vessels.",
      "Hosted under the umbrella title \"In Search of Us,\"\u00a0this year's installation in Lower Manhattan ties 11 projects together under the rubric of impacts on humanity \u2014 exploring topics from artificial intelligence to climate change, war, school shootings and transphobia. The exhibits with the most profound effects are those with the strongest and most emotional stories embedded inside them.",
      "Within a simple, delineated space furnished with minimal furniture, \"Fragile Home,\" by Ond\u0159ej Moravec and Victoria Lopukhina, uses mixed reality to recreate a home in Ukraine that comes under bombardment. Wearing goggles, the viewer walks through a comfortable, well-appointed living room, past a dinner table and a purring cat, and looks outside the window to a peaceful vista \u2014 all of which, in a flash, is replaced by the home's bombed-out remains, vandalized with Russian forces' \"Z\" graffiti.",
      "The sense of violation is made so powerful in so simple a setting \u2014 and the recognition that such destruction is multiplied millions of times over is heart-wrenching. But the objects that survived \u2014 those with personal meaning to just a handful of people \u2013 become representations of resilience to many.",

But if the AI program \"likes\" you? Your AI-altered image will turn up in its pantheon of favored carbon-based units (pictured above, right).",

Using haptic VR, the viewer is literally strapped into a chair; electrodes are attached to your fingertips, arms, and torso, along with VR goggles. Interesting, you think. Then, the presentation begins, recounting the true story of a survivor of electroshock conversion therapy. (As a teenager, Carolyn Mercer had been \"treated\" with electrical shocks in an attempt to \"cure\" her from becoming trans.) As images of female beauty are flashed before you, electrical impulses throb across your body. Ironically, the creators' use of  haptic VR to demonstrate the harrowing effects of the pseudoscience of conversion therapy makes  one never want to have VR electrodes attached to your body.",

    "summary": "There is a slight catch to keep in mind: These new iOS26 features will be reserved for iPhone 11 and later models.",
    "story": [
      "Apple kicked off its annual Worldwide Developers Conference on Monday with an array of announcements on new features coming this fall via iOS 26, its latest operating system upgrade. Leading the pack is a new user interface enhancement called Liquid Glass.",
      "CEO Tim Cook and other Apple executives used words like \"beautiful,\" \"gorgeous\" and \"delightful\" to describe changes on the horizon for its devices. And while they emphasized a fresh user interface and elevated app features, they also reassured users that the tools would remain familiar and accessible.",
      "Read on for details on the latest bells and whistles coming to Apple's user interface.",
      "iOS 26, iPadOS 26, macOS Tahoe 26",
      "Apple is adopting a new nomenclature for identifying its operating systems, one that is more straightforward than its previous numbering system. Rather than iOS 19, Apple's next iPhone iOS will be called iOS 26 to align with the upcoming year. iOS 26, along with iPadOS 26, macOS Tahoe 26, watchOS 26, and tvOS 261 are slated to be released as free updates in September 2025.",
      "In addition to new design elements detailed below, iOS 26 will elevate the capabilities of existing apps including Facetime, Photos, Safari and Carplay.",
      "There's also a splashy update to iPhone photo display: With iOS 26, users will\u00a0 be able to view pictures in 3D across the Photos app, lock screen and home screen.",
      "Apple is also making changes to its messages app. Texters with iOS 26 will be able to change the background, or wallpaper, of a chat conversation. The feature is similar to the \"chat theme\" setting on WhatsApp but with more options. In group chats, dots will appear to indicate who is typing \u2014 something previously reserved for one-on-one chats. Texters will also be able create and share polls directly in group messages.",
      "Filtering texts and calls will also become a lot easier with a new screening feature.",
      "\"Unknown senders appear in a dedicated area where you can decide if you want to mark the number as known, ask for more information or delete until you accept messages from unknown senders will remain silenced and won't appear as notifications,\" said Darin Adler, a vice president at Apple.",
      "When you receive a call from an unknown number, Apple will answer the phone silently, record the caller's name and the reason for their call, and then put their response into a written message for the owner of the phone so they can decide whether they want to actually pick up.",
      "There is a slight catch to keep in mind: These new iOS26 features will be reserved for iPhone 11 and later models.",
      "Design upgrades, including Liquid Glass",
      "Alan Dye, Apple's vice president of human interface design, calls the new OS, the company's \u00a0\"broadest design update ever.\"",
      "A hallmark feature of the new OS is\u00a0Liquid Glass, described by the company as an \"expressive material\" meant to mimic the qualities of glass. The dynamic new interface make apps, widgets and docs appear translucent, allowing users to see multiple layers of their screen at once.",
      "Liquid Glass also creates more movement on your interface by morphing into your display. For example, as messages pop up on your home screen, the time display starts to shrink to accommodate them. The color of Liquid Glass also shifts depending on the content on your screen and adapts between light and dark environments.",
      "\"From navigating apps to system experiences like the lock screen notifications and control center app icons have been crafted with multiple layers of Liquid Glass and come to life in light mode, dark mode, colorful, new tints, or an all new clear look,\" said Dye during the company's keynote Monday.",
      "Apple Intelligence",
      "Apple also delivered long-awaited updates to Apple Intelligence, the company's artificial intelligence system that's now integrated with ChatGPT. AI-powered features arriving this fall include Live Translation, which automatically translates messages as they're being received.",
      "\"So if you're making plans with some new friends while studying abroad, your message can be translated as you type and delivered in their preferred language, and when they respond, each text can be instantly translated for you,\" said Leslie Ikemoto, an engineering director at Apple said at the conference Monday.",
      "Visual Intelligence, another AI tool, allows users to take a screenshot of an image they see online \u2014 say, a cute sweater they come across on one of their apps \u2014 and then look up where to find a similar design online. They can also ask ChatGPT specific questions about the image, such as, keeping with the example of the sweater, \"What material is this made of?\"",
      "Another feature builds on Apple broad selection of emojis by giving users the power to combine and personalize existing emojis to create their own unique expressions. In their presentation, Apple showed how someone could merge the lightbulb emoji with the sloth emoji to indicate they were the last one to get a joke, for example.",
      "Still lingering on Apple's to do list is new AI integrations for Siri. Apple introduced updates to the voice assistant at last year's conference, but the full suite of upgrades for the voice assistant have yet to take effect. \"We're continuing our work to deliver the features that make Siri even more personal,\" said senior vice president of software engineering Craig Federighi on Monday. \"This work needed more time to reach our high quality bar, and we look forward to sharing more about it in the coming year.\"",
      "In a research note, Wedbush tech analyst Dan Ives noted that the Apple Intelligence rollout has been slower than expected, but also estimates that over the next few years, 25% of the world population will access AI through an Apple-powered device.",
      "\"While many on [Wall] Street are heading into WWDC as underwhelming given the slower-than-expected rollout of Apple Intelligence, we disagree with this bearish narrative and strongly believe this will be the start of AI monetization period of the Apple ecosystem as the company will continue to lay the foundation through its new operating system updates across Mac, iOS, iPad and others with its '26\" update,'\" Ives said.",

    "story": [
      "New college graduates this year face an especially daunting task \u2014 putting their degrees to work just as \"generative\" artificial intelligence technology like ChatGPT is beginning to change the American workplace.",
      "\"We are entering an entirely new economy, so the knowledge economy that we have been in for the last 50 years or so is on the way out, and a new economy is on the way in,\" Aneesh Raman, Chief Economic Opportunity Officer at LinkedIn, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "The impact of AI on Americans recently out of college is already visible across a range of industries and jobs, from technology and finance to media, legal fields and market research. As a result, for the first time\u00a0unemployment among fresh grads recently surpassed the nation's overall jobless rate \u2014 a shift some experts attribute in part to the creeping influence of AI.",
      "\"There are signs that entry-level positions are being displaced by artificial intelligence at higher rates than the roles above them,\" said Matthew Martin, senior U.S. economist at Oxford Economics.",
      "With the adoption of AI at work only expected to accelerate, we asked three experts across academia, recruitment and consulting for advice on how new college grads should navigate this new normal. Here's what they said.",
      "Become fluent in AI",
      "Perhaps most important, young job-seekers start using gen-AI tools \u2014 today.",
      "\"Almost anybody in that audience, irrespective of the job that they're pursuing, will be expected to use AI with some facility right away,\" said Joseph Fuller, a professor at Harvard Business School and founder of the Managing the Future of Work\u00a0project, comparing the task to learning how to use Microsoft Office for a previous generation of grads.",
      "To get the ball rolling, experts encourage those who are starting to hunt for work to familiarize themselves with the array of tools at their disposal, such as Anthropic's Claude or OpenAI's ChatGPT. That means learning how to engage with such tools beyond simply using them as a search engine.",
      "\"You want to get in a dialogue with it,\" Fuller said. \"You want to ask it to take different perspectives.\"",
      "Emily Rose McRae, an analyst at research and advisory firm Gartner, said learning how to use AI apps can also be a good way to develop transferable skills. For example, asking AI to summarize documents and then validating its findings to ensure accuracy.",
      "Meanwhile, although AI can be helpful when it comes time to filling out job applications, users should proceed with caution given that recruiters can often spot AI-generated language, experts note. Nearly two-thirds of job candidates today use AI at some point in the application process, according to a\u00a0report from recruitment firm Career Group Companies.",
      "\"If you're using it to write your cover letter and your resume and you did not review it, everyone can tell,\" McRae said.",
      "Another way to gain potentially valuable experience with AI, while also seeking work, is for interview practice. For example, users can ask the chatbot both to provide sample questions they might face in an interview and then rate the quality of their responses.",
      "\"If you are using it as a tool to get your own understanding of self in interviews, you're going to start being leaps ahead of everyone else,\" Raman said.",
      "Hone your soft skills",
      "Experts say that as AI surpasses humans in executing certain tasks \u2014 think actuarial math or corporate compliance, for example \u2014more attention will shift to job candidates' so-called soft skills, such as problem solving and communication.",
      "\"You cannot outsource your thinking to AI,\" LinkedIn's Raman said. \"You have to continue to hone critical thinking and complex strategy thinking.\"",
      "The focus will be less on your pedigree \u2014 where you went to school or even whether you have a college degree \u2014 he added, and more on what he calls the \"5 Cs\": curiosity, compassion, creativity, courage and communication.",
      "To improve their soft skills, Fuller encourages entry-level job candidates to work on turning what they regard as their biggest weakness into a strength. For instance, if you typically shy away from public speaking or talking in groups, push yourself to get comfortable in those situations.",
      "\"The inability to do that is going to be penalized more severely in the work of the future than it has been in the past,\" he said.",
      "The Harvard professor also suggested highlighting examples of advanced social skills directly on your resume to help paint a picture for recruiters of how you can contribute to the workplace.",
      "Choose your employer wisely",
      "Beyond skills development, experts say college grads should be thoughtful about the type of company they choose to work at, knowing that AI could drastically alter the business in the coming years.",
      "\"The most important thing, if you're a new grad, is where you work \u2014 not what you do at the place you're going to work,\" Raman told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "He encouraged college graduates to seek out employers that are integrating AI responsibly and with respect for their workforce \u2014 as opposed to embracing it chiefly to replace people. Companies that are adapting to what is a major technological shift in real time will typically offer the best opportunities for learning and growth, Fuller said.",
      "In evaluating a prospective employer, young job candidates should try to gain an understanding of how they fit into the company's future. For example, McRae recommends asking hiring managers up front what types of investments the organization is making in its employees and what the room for growth looks like.",
      "\"What are they telling me they care about? What do career paths look like for this role like now? How do you help people develop the skills they need to become experts?\" she said.",
      "In researching companies, McRae also encouraged recent college grads to look for places that offer apprenticeship or rotational programs, which can offer ways to quickly ramp up their knowledge base, especially if traditional entry-level roles are in short supply.",

New Hampshire's average tipping rate is four times that of the nation's lowest tipping state, which is Utah at 4.09%.",
      "But that's not to say Utah residents are stingy. As LendingTree points out, average tipping rates hinge on how much people in each state spend on food outside the home \u2014 which includes full-service restaurants as well as fast food place and even vending machines. In other words, not all food that's consumed outside the home is purchased at establishments where tipping is common.",

D.C. residents spent $10,291 on dining out in 2023, about $3,500 more than residents in Nevada, the runner up. Illinois, on the other hand, saw the biggest increase in money spent on eating out, with dining expenditures climbing 13.5% from 2000 to 2023.",

      "Tipping in the service industry has recently come into focus with the \"No Tax on Tips\" \u2014 a provision baked into the GOP spending bill that would remove federal taxes from tips for workers who earn less than $160,000.

      "The Harvey Weinstein retrial in New York took another dramatic turn Thursday when the judge declared a mistrial on the last undecided charge.",
      "The jury returned a partial verdict Wednesday, finding Weinstein guilty of criminal sexual assault against\u00a0Miriam Haley\u00a0and not guilty of criminal sexual assault against\u00a0Kaja Sokola.",
      "At the time, the jury told the judge they had not yet reached a verdict on the charge of third-degree rape against Jessica Mann, and the judge said they would continue deliberating Thursday.",
      "The judge asked the jury foreperson Thursday morning if he felt they could continue and he replied, \"No, I'm sorry.\" The judge then thanked the jury for their time and said the decision to declare a mistrial did not reflect on them.",
      "Some jurors said they were disappointed as they left court, saying they took the case seriously and gave it their best. They said most of the jury felt Weinstein should be convicted of rape, but it came down to one juror who did not want to change his mind.",
      "\"It started rocky, as I'm sure everybody know by now it was a rough couple days. Unfortunately, things broke down. A lot of good people in there, a lot of stuff happened,\" a juror, who did not want to be identified, said outside the courthouse.",
      "Weinstein did not appear to have much of a reaction to the mistrial ruling. He could now face another retrial in New York on the rape charge.",
      "Jessica Mann's testimony and rape allegation",
      "Mann testified for days, as she did in Weinstein's 2020 trial, alleging he raped her in a Manhattan hotel room in 2013. She said it happened during a consensual relationship that continued for years afterward, telling the jury she \"compartmentalized\" the pain he caused.",
      "Weinstein's lawyers emphasized she kept seeing him, accepting invitations and sending him messages.",
      "\"Rape can happen in relationships \u2014 and in dynamics where power and manipulation control the narrative,\" Mann said in a statement Wednesday.",

      "Juror alleges harassment, threats during apparently tense deliberations",
      "The deliberations among the seven women and five men on the jury were seemingly tense.",

      "Monday, a juror requested to speak with the judge privately.",
      "Wednesday, the jury foreperson asked to speak to the judge in private and alleged another juror had threatened him over his decision on the rape charge.",
      "\"Somebody talk to me, 'Oh, we will see you outside,' because I got my decision. I say, 'No, that's my personal decision. You don't have to change me,'\" the foreperson said, according to a transcript.",
      "The defense repeatedly called for a mistrial over the apparent problems among the jury, and Weinstein himself weighed in Wednesday.",
      "\"This isn't fair. This isn't right. I'm the one on trial. This is my life that's on the line, I am not getting a fair trial. You are endangering me,\" he said.",
      "The judge asked the jury foreperson if he felt safe returning to court Thursday, and the jury foreperson said he did, but he was offered court-appointed security.",
      "The jury requested the rules of a hung jury and other rules of deliberations earlier in the week.",
      "What to know about the retrial of Harvey Weinstein",
      "New York's highest court\u00a0overturned\u00a0Weinstein's\u00a02020 conviction\u00a0last year, ruling the judge in his first trial should not have allowed testimony from accusers who were not part of the criminal charges. Weinstein then spent months at the\u00a0Rikers Island jail complex\u00a0leading up to his retrial.",
      "The 73-year-old disgraced Hollywood mogul\u00a0pleaded not guilty\u00a0to\u00a0two counts of first-degree criminal sex act\u00a0and one count of third-degree rape. Both carry a maximum sentence of 25 years in prison.",
      "Both Haley and Mann, who testified during the original trial, were back on the stand for the retrial. Haley testified Weinstein forcibly performed oral sex on her in July 2006.",
      "Sokola also testified this time, alleging Weinstein forcibly performed oral sex on her in 2006 when she was 19 years old. She was\u00a0not part of the original trial.",
      "Weinstein pleaded not guilty and denied the allegations, saying any encounters were consensual.",
      "After the jury\u00a0left for deliberations on June 5, he asked to address the court, saying in part, \"I've been treated incredibly fairly. The court officers, the court clerks, everybody I just want to thank from the bottom of my heart. I appreciate you all.\"",

      "The looming federal funding cuts to public television and radio would overwhelmingly gut outlets in states won by President Trump in 2024, according to a new congressional report.",
      "Approximately 60% of the hundreds of radio and television stations that could suffer funding cuts are in Trump-won states, according to a congressional report obtained by CBS News from Senate Democrats.",
      "The organizations that would be affected include public media outlets in cities as large as Houston and Miami, as well as smaller stations in tiny communities like Douglas, Wyoming, which has a population of 6,000 and hosts the Wyoming State Fair.",
      "The widespread cuts to public radio and television are a component of a Republican congressional plan to eliminate $9 billion in funding for programs approved before President Trump's second term began.",
      "The proposed rescissions package, which is scheduled for a House vote Thursday, includes $1.1 billion in cuts for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which provides funding to NPR and PBS. The cuts to public broadcasting are being touted by the Trump administration and Republicans as an effort to slash taxpayer funding for news media outlets they accuse of being \"liberal\" or politically biased in their content.",
      "Advocates for public broadcasting have lambasted the cuts as destructive, needless and harmful to communities that have very limited sources of local broadcast news. They also deny allegations of political bias.",
      "The list of hundreds of TV and radio outlets facing funding cuts shows a broad range of impact. Major public television and radio stations in Charlotte, North Carolina, and Washington, D.C., could each lose nearly $1 million in grants in the coming months. An FM community public radio station in Carbondale, Colorado, which touts itself as \"Public access radio that connects community members to one another and the world,\" received $145,000 in federal grant funding last year.",
      "At each of the public media outlets, the list shows reductions that are sizable enough to potentially require staffing cuts, programming reductions or news cutbacks that threaten to exacerbate shortages of local news content.",
      "CBS News' review of proposed grant cuts shows Alabama, a state with an estimated 215 public media employees, would lose as much as $3 million in funding for its public television outlets in the coming months.",
      "In South Dakota, a sparsely populated state that nonetheless receives $3 million in funds for public broadcasting employees, the funding cuts would gut money for at least 20 media outlets, according to the report provided by congressional aides to CBS News.",
      "\"The path to better public media is achievable only if funding is maintained. Otherwise, a vital lifeline that operates reliable emergency communications, supports early learning, and keeps local communities connected and informed will be cut off with regrettable and lasting consequences,\" said Patricia Harrison, president and CEO of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting.",
      "\"Federal funding for the public broadcasting system is irreplaceable,\" Harrison said. \"Public media serves all \u2014 families and individuals, in rural and urban communities \u2014 free of charge and commercial free.\"",
      "Both PBS and NPR have sued the Trump administration over previous executive orders cutting their funding, with lawyers for both alleging that among other issues, the cuts violate the First Amendment.",
      "PBS CEO Paula Kerger previously said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" that while PBS only receives 15% of its funding from the federal government, some of its smaller stations receive up to 50% of their funding from federal sources and said the risks to the smaller stations are \"existential\" if the funding is cut.",
      "NPR CEO Katherine Maher has said roughly 1% of the organization's budget comes directly from federal dollars.",
      "Some of the many impacted public radio and TV stations have posted messages protesting the proposed cuts in funding. The social media account of a Baltimore public radio station leader said, \"This isn't hypothetical\u2014it's real, it's happening, and it places the future of local, trusted public media at serious risk. Let me be clear: this is not a symbolic move. If approved, this action could irreparably damage the local public media.\"",
      "Rural communities, often referred to as \"news deserts\" because of the lack of local news organizations, would suffer the brunt of the pain. According to a joint statement by Rep. Mark Amodei, a Nevada Republican, and Rep. Dan Goldman, a New York Democrat, \"Rural broadcasters face significant challenges in raising private funds, making them particularly vulnerable if government funding is cut.\"",
      "Sen. Patty Murray, a Washington Democrat who is the vice chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee, said in a statement to CBS News, \"Trump wants Congress to vote to cut off public radio broadcasts our constituents count on for weather forecasts, emergency alerts, and updates on what's going on in their community\u2014and force layoffs at local TV stations.\"",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, has championed the cuts and sought to rally support ahead of Thursday's vote on the rescissions package.",

      "\"Let me be clear: Sanctuary policies do not protect Americans. They protect criminal illegal aliens,\" Oversight Chair James Comer, a Kentucky Republican said in his opening statement.",
      "The governors' appearances come as President Trump and California Gov. Gavin Newsom\u00a0remain embroiled in a legal and political standoff\u00a0over the deployment of the National Guard troops and Marines to quell immigration protests in Los Angeles.\u00a0Demonstrations have spread to other U.S. cities, including New York and Chicago, following a series of deportation raids.",
      "The hearing",
      "Comer claimed state and local officials are \"actively undermining federal immigration enforcement,\" saying legislative action is needed to \"stop this subversion and stop the rule of law.\"",
      "\"Despite President Trump's efforts to secure the border and enforce the law, Democrat-run sanctuary cities and states are siding with illegal aliens,\" Comer said. \"For today's Democrat Party, it seems unlimited illegal immigration isn't a failure of policy \u2014 it is the policy.\"",
      "The committee's top Democrat, Rep. Stephen Lynch of Massachusetts, rebuked the Trump administration for its response to protests in L.A. in his opening statement, calling it \"thuggery.\"",
      "\"This is wrong. Deploying the military against a civilian population is wrong,\" Lynch said. \"If we don't step up and declare what is right under our Constitution, then other cities, other citizens, will meet this same fate.\"",
      "Walz pushed back on the premise of the hearing in his opening statement, saying \"nothing Minnesota has done to serve its own people stands in the way of the federal government managing border security and policies.\" And he noted that \"while you've convened this hearing to explore the issue of so-called sanctuary states, Minnesota is not even a sanctuary state.\"",

      "Ahead of the hearing, the GOP-led panel released a video compilation\u00a0of various news clips accusing the governors of \"shielding\" undocumented immigrants and \"causing chaos\" in their states.",
      "A memo from Hochul's office suggested the hearing could be \"derailed by wild accusations\" and \"twisted characterizations\" but noted the governor's position is \"clear\" when it comes to supporting strong borders and comprehensive immigration reform.",
      "Hochul addressed the influx of more than 220,000 migrants to New York City since early 2022, many of whom were bussed from border states, in her opening statement. \"New York has managed an unprecedented immigrant influx because of a broken border,\" she said, adding that \"at the same time, our state has become stronger and safer.\"",
      "\"My views on immigration are simple and direct,\" Hochul said. \"Our nation needs secure borders. Our nation needs comprehensive immigration reform from this body. And our state laws dictate that we cooperate with ICE in criminal cases, and our values dictate that we treat all law-abiding people with dignity and respect.\"",
      "Pritzker said Illinois also stepped up to the challenge, and blamed the lack of federal intervention and cooperation from border states for exacerbating the problem.",
      "\"Illinois follows the law, but let me be clear, we expect the federal government to follow the law, too,\" Pritzker said. \"We will not participate in abuses of power.\"",
      "The Illinois governor said \"it's wrong to deploy the National Guard and active-duty Marines into an American city over the objection of local law enforcement just to inflame a situation and create a crisis,\" Pritzker said.",
      "The hearing featured a handful of heated moments between the Democratic governors and Republican lawmakers. GOP Rep. Elise Stefanik of New York grilled Hochul over what the two agreed were \"horrific crimes\" that occurred in the state. Stefanik claimed they came as a result of \"Kathy Hochul's failed policies.\" Hochul accused Stefanik of \"going after the viral moment\" with her line of questioning.",
      "House Majority Whip Tom Emmer, a Minnesota Republican, criticized Walz for what he said is\u00a0 \"dangerous inflammatory rhetoric\" about ICE. And he accused the Minnesota governor of \"handcuffing law enforcement.\"",

      "\"The records reveal for the first time that Senator Kennedy shared his experiences traveling to the former Soviet Union with CIA, reflecting his patriotic commitment to serving his country,\" the CIA said in a statement accompanying the release.",
      "Kennedy was shot and killed by Sirhan Sirhan after the Democratic presidential primary in California in June 1968, four and a half years after President John F. Kennedy, his brother, was slain in Dallas. Sirhan, a Palestinian with Jordanian citizenship, said later that he killed RFK because of RFK's support for Israel in the Six-Day War in 1967.",
      "What's in the new files?",
      "The disclosure includes\u00a054 newly declassified documents\u00a0totaling 1,450 pages.

      "One cable from June 29, 1968, showed officers in Sri Lanka reporting back to headquarters in Virginia about efforts to place favorable news coverage in a local newspaper to shape public opinion following the assassination. The article \"makes [the] point that America has no monopoly on violence\" and that China \"points a pious finger at America and expects the world to ignore the Mao-supported wave upon wave of violence unleashed by the Red Guards,\" the cable said.",

As a young Senate staffer in 1955, Kennedy traveled to the Soviet Union for several weeks with Supreme Court Justice William Douglas, his longtime friend, and detailed his observations and experiences in a series of reports for the CIA.",

      "U.S. and Israeli officials confirmed diplomatic efforts are still underway, though multiple U.S. officials say they believe Israel may be preparing an imminent military strike against Iran.",
      "On Thursday, the United Nations' Vienna-based nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency, stated that Iran is not complying with nuclear non-proliferation obligations. Iran swiftly condemned the finding as politically motivated.",
      "Iranian Foreign Minister Seyed Abbas Araghchi, in a post on X, accused the UK, France and Germany, the three major European powers collectively known as the E3, of fomenting confrontation. The E3 remains a party to the 2015 international nuclear agreement known as the JCPOA. The U.S. withdrew from the agreement in 2018, and Iran partially withdrew in 2019. The European countries who remain party to the deal could seek to trigger the snapback of UN sanctions on Iran in the coming months.",
      "\"Another major strategic mistake by the E3 will compel Iran to react strongly,\" Araghchi said in the post.",
      "Following the IAEA determination that it was not in compliance, Iran announced that the head of its atomic energy organization issued orders for a new enrichment facility and replacement of centrifuges at the underground facility at Fordow.",
      "Mr. Trump publicly declared on Truth Social last week that he would not allow Iran to enrich any uranium, but the White House has not so far not disclosed the contents of the nuclear proposal.",
      "Nearly two weeks ago, Witkoff transmitted to Iran via Omani officials a proposal from the U.S. Two sources familiar with the details of that proposal told CBS News that the U.S. does not want Iran to develop any domestic enrichment of nuclear fuel for what it claims is a civilian program. To maintain that limited program, the two sources said Iran would have to procure the enriched nuclear fuel from outside the country, rather than enrich it on Iranian soil.",
      "Mr. Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin discussed Iran last Wednesday during a lengthy call that lasted over an hour, according to Mr. Trump's post on Truth Social. Mr. Trump said that time is running out on Iran's decision-making about nuclear weapons.",
      "He said Putin \"suggested that he will participate in the discussions with Iran\" and that he could be helpful in concluding the talks. Tehran and Moscow have forged an informal military alliance in Ukraine, with Russian forces using Iranian-produced Shahed drones to bomb Ukrainian targets, including civilians.",
      "Moscow could play a few roles in the negotiations with Iran, a source familiar with the proposal explained to CBS News. Russia could be a source for nuclear fuel purchase by Iran, for instance, or it could also be the receiving country for the storage of the existing enriched uranium produced by Iran. This would be similar to the role it played under the 2015 international nuclear agreement known as the JCPOA.",
      "There are also other ideas proposed by the U.S., too. Axios was first to report that Oman suggested establishing a regional consortium to enrich uranium for civilian purposes under monitoring by the IAEA and the U.S. A source familiar with the proposal indicated that this was one of the ideas presented to Tehran.",
      "During testimony before a Senate panel Wednesday, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth fielded questions about the diplomatic efforts.",
      "\"There are plenty of indications that they have been moving their way towards something that would look a lot like a nuclear weapon,\" Hegseth said in response to a question about whether Tehran's nuclear program was peaceful. The powerful chair of the U.S. Senate Intelligence Committee \u2013 GOP Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas \u2013 appeared to seize on that statement in a social media post in which he said, \"Iran's terrorist regime is actively working towards a nuclear weapon.\"",
      "But U.S. intelligence assesses that Iran halted its nuclear weapons program in 2003. U.S. intelligence has also assessed that Tehran has continued since 2018 to enrich nuclear fuel at levels close to weapons grade. Due to that enrichment, U.S. intelligence assesses that Iran is currently a threshold nuclear state, which means it could decide to pursue a weaponization program within relatively short order.",
      "Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu has long been a skeptic of diplomatic attempts to restrain Iran's nuclear program and often points to documents stolen by the Mossad back in 2018 as evidence of past Iranian ambition to acquire its own nuclear weapon. Netanyahu has been pressing Mr. Trump to provide U.S. support for Israeli military action against Iran, arguing that Tehran is in a historically weak position, given the success of the Israeli decapitation of its militia Hezbollah and its decimation of Hamas in Gaza.",
      "While Mr. Trump has held off on sanctioning Russia, which the administration has said is to avoid disrupting diplomatic outreach on Ukraine, he has sanctioned Iran amid an attempt at diplomacy regarding the nuclear program.",
      "Last Friday, the Treasury Department announced sanctions against 30 individuals tied to two Iranian brothers alleged to have helped launder billions of dollars through front companies that the regime uses to help fund its nuclear and missile programs.",
      "CBS News obtained a classified version of a report presented to member states by IAEA Director General Rafael Grossi. The report notes that Iran is the only non-nuclear weapon state in the world that is producing and accumulating uranium enriched to 60%, which remains a matter of serious concern. Uranium for civilian use is enriched to a much lower rate, between 3% and 5%.",
      "Mark Dubowitz, of U.S.-based Foundation for Defense of Democracies, told CBS News that the report proved that \"Iran is a serial violator of the [Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty], stonewalling the IAEA on its past \u2014 and possibly ongoing \u2014 nuclear weaponization work.\"",
      "Dubowitz and other pro-Israel advocates are raising alarms and argue the Iranian regime should not have any right to enrich uranium on its soil.",
      "The IAEA director general also reiterated in his report his call for Iran to cooperate with IAEA inspections \u2014 or risk \"the Agency will not be in a position to provide assurance that Iran's nuclear programme is exclusively peaceful.\"",
      "Israel has an undeclared nuclear weapons program, and the IAEA has no access to its facility at Dimona, which is believed to provide the fuel for its weapons program. The IAEA does monitor the site known as Soreq. At this point, Israel maintains a strategic edge as the only nuclear power in the Mideast.",

      "A senior police official initially told The Associated Press there were no known survivors from the crash of Air India flight AI171. Later, however, two officials said one man who had been on the plane survived and was being treated at a hospital. Officials also feared numerous casualties on the ground, as the aircraft had crashed into buildings.",
      "Air India said the plane, a Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner, departed at 1:38 p.m. local time carrying 242 people, including 169 Indian nationals, 53 British nationals, seven Portuguese nationals and one Canadian.",
      "\"Investigations will take time, but anything we can do now, we are doing,\" Air India CEO Campbell Wilson said in a video statement on Thursday. \"We understand that people are eager for information. Please know that we will continue to share accurate and timely information as soon as we can, but anything we report must be accurate and not speculative. We owe that to everyone involved.

      "Wilson said the airline was sending a \"a special team of caregivers\" to Ahmedabad to provide support.",
      "Gatwick Airport, which is just south of London, said the plane had been due to land there at 6:25 p.m. local time (1:25 p.m. Eastern).",
      "\"It appears there are no survivors in the plane crash,\" the AP quoted Ahmedabad Police Commissioner G.S. Malik as saying. \"As the plane has fallen in a residential area which also had offices, some locals would have also died.\"",
      "Malik was later quoted by India's national news agency ANI as saying there was one survivor found on the plane, but there was no further confirmation from the airline. A health department official also said there was one survivor, the AFP news agency reported.",

      "The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration said India's government would lead the investigation, but added that it was \"ready to launch a team immediately in coordination with the NTSB\" if required.",
      "Unverified video shared online by Indian network NDTV purportedly shows the passenger jet flying low over buildings before disappearing behind them. There is then a large explosion. No fire or explosion can be seen on the aircraft before it disappears.",
      "Part of the plane hit the dining area of B.J. Medical College and killed at least five medical students, Divyansh Singh, vice president of the Federation of All India Medical Association, told the AP. He said nearly 50 people who had been in the building were injured.",
      "\"Some of the injured are critical. We are in close contact with our peers in the hospital who are on a lookout for more people feared buried in the debris,\" he said.",
      "India's Defense Minister Rajnath Singh said former Gujarat Chief Minister Vijay Rupani was among those killed in the plane crash.",
      "\"He will be remembered as a grassroots leader who devoted his life for the development & welfare of his state,\" Singh said in a statement on social media.",
      "The head of India's Directorate General of Civil Aviation, Faiz Ahmed Kidwai, told the AP that flight AI171 crashed five minutes after taking off. Live flight tracking website\u00a0Flight Radar said\u00a0a final signal was received from Flight AI171 just seconds after it took off. The flight path on Flight Radar showed the aircraft traveling southwest from the airport a short distance before the path stopped, and the site said initial data showed the aircraft reached a maximum barometric altitude of 625 feet before it started to descend.",
      "\"At this point, it's very, very, very early, we don't know a whole lot,\" Aviation consultant John M. Cox told the AP. \"But the 787 has very extensive flight data monitoring \u2014 the parameters on the flight data recorder are in the thousands \u2014 so once we get that recorder, they'll be able to know pretty quickly what happened.\"",

The remains were identified by Mongolian paleontologist Altangerel Perle as Alectrosaurus olsoni, another obscure species. After it was misidentified, the bones became part of a museum collection and were relatively untouched for almost 50 years.",
      "Referred to as mid-grade tyrannosauroids, these smaller-bodied predators were evolutionary intermediates, the study found. During the period when Khankhuuluu lived in Mongolia, the tyrannosaurs began growing larger and taking on the features of apex predators. Not much else is known about these elusive tyrannosauroids due to fragmentary fossil remains, but researchers said the dinosaurs weighed around 1,700 pounds. They were one of the larger predators in the ecosystem at the time.",
      "\"It's essentially the immediate ancestor of the tyrannosaur family,\" Zelenitsky said.",
      "A surprise discovery",
      "University of Calgary postdoctoral scholar and study co-author Jared Voris traveled to Mongolia a few years earlier to research the bones of various tyrannosaurs and, in the process, gained access to see the bones of what they would later determine are the Khankhuuluu.",
      "Voris thought the remains could be something important, as he often saw references to the specimens pop up, but after he started examining the bones, he knew it could be something special. While studying the individual characteristics of the bones, one of the things he noticed was that the Khankhuuluu's teeth couldn't crush bone, Voris said, a defining characteristic of the larger apex predatory Tyrannosaurus.",
      "\"This animal had features we had never seen before in more of our iconic tyrannosaurs,\" Voris said.",
      "He texted Zelenitsky from Mongolia that he \"thought it could be a new species.\" Zelenitsky said she responded, \"I said, great going, keep looking at this so we can be sure this is a new species.\"",
      "The two paleontologists aren't new to groundbreaking scientific discoveries \u2014 they've had several.\u00a0In 2023, Zelenitsky was part of a team that identified a Tyrannosaurus fossil with a meal in its stomach, and Voris discovered a new species of tyrannosaurid dinosaur, Thanatotheristes degrootorum \u2014 whose genus name translates to \"Reaper of Death.\"",
      "\"Rewriting a family history of tyrannosaurs\"",
      "These Asian tyrannosauroids eventually crossed over into North America using a northern land bridge between Alaska and Siberia, Zelenitsky said. Dinosaurs used these land bridges, which appeared periodically over the past 100 million years, to travel between Asia and North America.",
      "And from it, these tyrannosauroids evolved and morphed into apex predators. T. rex is the\u00a0deadliest land predator\u00a0ever to live, and there has long been a fascination with the dinosaur that has been extinct for about 66 million years.",
      "The study co-authors said the new identification shows there are still big discoveries to be made in science. \"What really started just as a discovery of a new species ended up with us kind of rewriting a family history of tyrannosaurs,\" Zelenitsky said.",

A conviction there would have reset the sentencing clock entirely\u2026 This trial has raised substantial appellate issues \u2014 and Harvey would welcome the opportunity to have those fully reviewed. It is the Court and the prosecution who now have every incentive to avoid seeing this case overturned on appeal.\"",

That proposal aims to improve export control mechanisms \u2013 including for chips and high-capacity chip manufacturing \u2013 protect covered AI technologies with a focus on cybersecurity, and limit outbound investment to firms directly tied to the Chinese Community Party or China's People's Liberation Army.",

But what this bill will do will again make sure that things are done the right way and the correct way, and that we're protecting our assets and promoting the current technology that we have in our country.\"",
      "LaHood pointed to evidence uncovered by the committee that he said shows the CCP's DeepSeek used illegal distillation techniques to steal insights from U.S. AI models to accelerate their own technology development. He also pointed to how China allegedly smuggled AI chips through Singapore intermediaries to circumvent U.S. export controls on the technology.",
      "\"As we look at, \u2018How do we win the strategic competition?\u2019 I think most experts would say we're ahead in AI right now against China, but not by much. It is a short lead,\" LaHood told Fox News Digital.",
      "He said he is confident his legislative proposals will put the U.S. \"in the best position to protect our assets here and make sure that we're not shipping things that shouldn't go to AI that allow them to win the AI race in China.\"",
      "\"Whoever wins this race in the future, it's going to be critical to future warfare capabilities, to, obviously, cybersecurity,\" LaHood continued. \"And then, whoever wins the AI competition is going to yield really unwavering economic influence in the future. And so we're aggressive in this bill in terms of targeting those areas where we need to protect our AI and our companies here in the United States, both on the commercial side and on the government side, to put us in the best position possible.\"",
      "National Security Agency Director Gen. Timothy Haugh speaks during a Senate Committee on Intelligence Hearing on March 25, 2025 in Washington, D.C. (Andrew Harnik/Getty Images)",
      "The \"Advanced AI Security Readiness Act\" calls on the NSA to develop a playbook that identifies vulnerabilities in AI data centers and developers producing sensitive AI technologies with an emphasis on unique \"threat vectors\" that do not typically arise, or are less severe, in the context of conventional information technology systems.\" The bill says the NSA must develop \"core insights\" in how advanced AI systems are being trained to identify potential interferences and must develop strategies to \"detect, prevent and respond to cyber threats by threat actors targeting covered AI technologies.\"",

      "Though not directly related, the new bill is being introduced a week after FBI Director Kash Patel sounded the alarm on how the CCP continues to deploy operatives and researchers to \"infiltrate\" U.S. institutions. Patel laid out the risk in announcing that two Chinese nationals were charged with smuggling a potential bioweapon into the U.S.",
      "LaHood said that case further highlights \"the level of penetration and sophistication that the CCP will engage in,\" but he added that his bill focuses on putting a \"protective layer\" on U.S. AI tech and \"restricting outbound investment to China.\" He pointed to how the CCP also has bought up farmland around strategic U.S. national security locations, particularly in Montana, North Dakota and South Dakota.",

      "1. You bought a low-cost Android-based device from an unknown or no-name brand:\u00a0Devices sold online through third-party sellers or unknown brands, especially if advertised as \"unlocked,\" \"jailbroken\" or offering free streaming, are at higher risk. Models like the T95 box or other generic Android TV boxes are known carriers. Specifically, the following devices have been identified as impacted by BadBox malware:",
      "Device model: TV98, X96Q_Max_P, Q96L2, X96Q2, X96mini, S168, ums512_1h10_Natv, X96_S400, X96mini_RP, TX3mini, HY-001, MX10PRO, X96mini_Plus1, LongTV_GN7501E, Xtv77, NETBOX_B68, X96Q_PR01, AV-M9, ADT-3, OCBN, X96MATE_PLUS, KM1, X96Q_PRO, Projector_T6P, X96QPRO-TM, sp7731e_1h10_native, M8SPROW, TV008, X96Mini_5G, Q96MAX, Orbsmart_TR43, Z6, TVBOX, Smart, KM9PRO, A15, Transpeed, KM7, iSinbox, I96, SMART_TV, Fujicom-SmartTV, MXQ9PRO, MBOX, X96Q, isinbox, Mbox, R11, GameBox, KM6, X96Max_Plus2, TV007, Q9 Stick, SP7731E, H6, X88, X98K, TXCZ",
      "2. Your device is not Google-certified:\u00a0If your Android device doesn't support\u00a0Google Play Protect or doesn't show the\u00a0Play Protect certification in the Play Store settings, it's likely running on an uncertified version of Android. That's a major red flag. To check:",
      "Open the\u00a0Google Play Store.Tap your profile icon >\u00a0Settings >\u00a0About.Look for\u00a0Play Protect certification. If it says\u00a0\"Device is not certified,\" that's a problem.",

      "Look for\u00a0Play Protect certification. If it says\u00a0\"Device is not certified,\" that's a problem.",
      "3. Suspicious behavior or strange apps:\u00a0Look for unfamiliar apps you didn't install, apps labeled with foreign characters or alternative app stores on your device. BadBox-infected devices often come with shady apps preloaded.",
      "4. Google Play Protect is disabled:\u00a0If Play Protect has been turned off without your knowledge or is missing altogether, your device may be vulnerable to compromise.",
      "5. Your home internet is acting strange:\u00a0If your network is unusually slow or your router shows unknown devices connected, one of your smart devices may be hijacked and rerouting traffic as part of a residential proxy network.",
      "6. The device came with outdated or unofficial firmware:\u00a0If your device doesn't receive software updates or has a strange update process, that's another potential sign it's not legit or may be compromised.",

Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "2. Only buy certified and trusted devices:\u00a0Stick to devices certified by Google or other recognized platforms. Avoid generic or off-brand Android boxes, tablets and projectors, especially if they are advertised as unlocked or include free streaming. Cheap, uncertified devices are more likely to come with malware preinstalled.",
      "3. Avoid sideloading apps from unofficial sources:\u00a0Do not install apps from third-party app stores or download APK files from unknown websites. These files can contain hidden malware. Use only official app stores like the Google Play Store that scan apps for threats.",
      "4. Check your device settings for tampering:\u00a0Look for signs like Google Play Protect being turned off, the presence of unfamiliar app stores or suspicious apps running in the background. These are possible signs your device is compromised.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "5. Monitor your network for unusual activity:\u00a0If your internet slows down suddenly, or you notice unknown devices on your Wi-Fi, investigate. Use your router's settings or a network monitoring app to track strange behavior or unauthorized connections.",
      "6. Disconnect and replace suspicious hardware:\u00a0If a device is behaving oddly or was purchased from an untrusted source, unplug it from your network. Consider replacing it with a product from a reputable brand and a verified seller.",
      "7. Keep your devices and apps updated:\u00a0Install system and app updates regularly. Even though cheap devices may not always offer updates,\u00a0keeping your software current reduces your risk. Choose brands that are known for providing reliable security patches.",
      "8. Secure your router and home network:\u00a0Your devices are only as safe as the network they're connected to. Set a strong, unique password for your Wi-Fi router and update its firmware regularly. Disable remote access unless absolutely necessary and use WPA3 encryption if available. Consider using a\u00a0password manager to generate and store complex passwords. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 here.",

      "THIS IS WHAT YOU ARE DOING WRONG WHEN SCAMMERS CALL",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "It's alarming how something as simple as a budget streaming box or projector could be quietly working for cybercriminals. As smart devices become part of almost everything we do, being a careful and informed consumer matters more than ever. Small steps like buying from trusted brands and avoiding unofficial downloads can make a big difference in keeping your home and personal data safe.",

Dozens of sensors in the hand generate haptic feedback, so users can better gauge grip strength and control. With more than 10 motors in the hand alone, Atom Touch offers a near-human range of motion and dexterity. The load-balanced harness system also makes the arm lighter than a human arm and comfortable enough for extended wear, addressing a challenge that many current prosthetics have yet to solve.",

      "For the more than 2 million Americans living with limb loss, current prosthetic options are often expensive, uncomfortable and limited in capability. Jason Morris, who lost his arm due to a work accident and is Atom Bodies' lead test user, notes that most prosthetics can only be worn for about two hours due to discomfort. Atom Touch is designed for initial wear of four to six hours, with the goal of achieving all-day use. Atom Bodies has already attracted significant interest, with over 11,000 people on its\u00a0wait list and plans to begin clinical trials within the next year, pending FDA approval.",

      "Tech expert Kurt Knutsson urges you to use Apple\u2019s App Privacy Report to see what your apps are really up to.",
      "Apple\u2019s iPad has a strong reputation for security. Thanks to the system architecture of iOS, a non-jailbroken iPad isn\u2019t susceptible to typical viruses or malware infections. However, that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s completely safe from every threat. As with any computer, there are still vulnerabilities that determined hackers can exploit.",
      "iPads are generally secure devices, but it\u2019s still possible for hackers to gain access, so knowing the warning signs of a hacked iPad can help you act quickly to protect your data. Moreover, an iPad often contains a lot of personal information about you and your family, so if it\u2019s ever hacked, it can be quite alarming.",

      "Be on the lookout for these signs that could indicate your iPad\u2019s security has been compromised:",
      "If your iPad suddenly feels more like a sluggish turtle than the speedy device it used to be, that\u2019s a warning sign. When a device is hacked, malicious software might be running in the background, using up memory and processing power. This can make apps slow to open, cause lagging or freezing and even lead to more frequent crashes. You might also notice the battery draining much faster than usual along with the slowdown, since unwanted software can chew through battery life while it secretly runs in the background.",
      "A sudden flood of pop-up ads or strange messages on your iPad screen is a big red flag. Under normal circumstances, iPads should not bombard you with random pop-ups, especially outside of safe apps or websites. If you start seeing lots of unsolicited ads or \"Your iPad is hacked!\" alerts popping up, it could mean an adware program or scam has found its way onto the device. These pop-ups might try to trick you or your kids into clicking links or downloading something harmful, so they\u2019re not just annoying, they\u2019re dangerous signs that something is wrong.",

      "HOW TO PROTECT AN IPHONE & IPAD FROM MALWARE 2025",
      "Keep an eye on how the iPad is using the internet. An unusual spike in data usage or constant network activity (even when no one is actively using the iPad) might indicate the device is secretly sending or receiving information without your permission. For example, if your data plan suddenly maxes out or you notice the Wi-Fi icon flickering with activity when the iPad is idle, it could be a sign that a hacker\u2019s software is communicating in the background. Such suspicious network activity is concerning because it suggests someone else might be remotely accessing the iPad or siphoning off personal data.",

      "You might also discover that account details or settings (like your recovery email or trusted phone number) have been altered.

      "If you suspect your iPad has been hacked, taking immediate action can secure your device and give you peace of mind. Here are a few basic steps to help you respond:",
      "1) Reset your passwords: Change your Apple ID password right away (and any other important account passwords used on the iPad) to lock out any intruders. Using a strong password (think long, random and unique to each account) greatly reduces that risk. A password manager can help you generate and store complex passwords so you don\u2019t have to remember them all yourself. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 here.",
      "2) Remove unfamiliar apps: Check the iPad for any apps you or your child didn\u2019t install. If you find an unknown app or a suspicious profile, delete it immediately. This helps eliminate any malicious programs the hacker may have added. To do this, open\u00a0Settings, tap\u00a0General\u00a0>\u00a0iPad Storage, scroll to find the unfamiliar app, tap\u00a0it, then tap\u00a0Delete App and confirm.",
      "3) Update iOS: Make sure the iPad is running the latest version of iPadOS. Apple frequently releases security updates to fix vulnerabilities, so\u00a0updating the software can shut down any loopholes the hacker might have used. Turning on automatic updates is a good idea to stay protected going forward.",
      "4) Enable two-factor authentication: If you haven\u2019t already,\u00a0turn on two-factor authentication for your Apple ID account. This feature adds an extra verification step (like a code sent to your phone) whenever someone tries to sign in, which can stop hackers in their tracks even if they somehow know your password. It\u2019s an excellent safeguard to prevent unauthorized access.",
      "5) Have strong antivirus protection on all devices: Malware, spyware and viruses can run quietly in the background or compromise enough data before it is discovered. While not being hacked in the first place is the best position to be in, it is worse to give access to your iPad\u2019s data to a hacker for a prolonged period of time. That\u2019s why having strong antivirus software running consistently in the background of your device is a great way to prevent compromises from happening in the first place.\u00a0Best antivirus security software and apps to protect you.",

      "It\u2019s important to remember that many of these symptoms can have innocent explanations, so don\u2019t panic at the first sign of trouble. For example, a new iOS update or a heavy app can temporarily slow down your iPad\u2019s performance, so one isolated issue doesn\u2019t always mean you\u2019ve been hacked. However, if you notice multiple warning signs at the same time or anything that just doesn\u2019t feel right, it\u2019s best to act quickly and err on the side of caution.",

      "Glide underwater with CudaJet and make the ocean your playground. Kurt Knutsson discusses the redesigned tech that might be your next big thrilling adventure.",
      "If you've ever dreamed of gliding underwater with the freedom of a dolphin, the CudaJet might be the gadget for you. Unlike most underwater propulsion systems that strap onto your arms or legs, the CudaJet is worn like a backpack, giving you a hands-free way to cruise beneath the surface. It's a fresh approach that feels a lot more natural and comfortable, especially for longer swims.",
      "The CudaJet's story started almost seven years ago. Back then, it was just a prototype called the Cuda, a passion project by British designer Archie O'Brien during his final year at Loughborough College of Art and Design, now known as Loughborough Design School. Archie wanted something lighter and faster than anything else out there, and in 2023 his vision became reality with the first commercial CudaJet.",
      "Now, the CudaJet has been redesigned with a longer battery life, lighter build and updated features, making it even more appealing to underwater adventure seekers.",

      "CudaJet underwater jetpack: How it works and what\u2019s new",
      "So, what's it like to use? The main unit is a dual-jet-drive pack that attaches to a padded neoprene harness, which you wear on your torso. You control everything with a hardwired, trigger-style remote that lets you adjust your speed and keep an eye on the battery level. One of the biggest improvements for 2025 is the battery. While the original model provided approximately 40 minutes of underwater fun for every 75-minute charge, the latest version extends that time to a full 90 minutes per charge. That's more than double the original runtime, so you can explore even more on a single outing.",
      "CudaJet can take you down to a maximum depth of 131 feet, and it delivers about 88 pounds of thrust. That translates to a top speed of roughly 10 feet per second, or about 6.7 mph. Now, that might not sound fast on land, but underwater it's a whole different story. The company likes to point out that at 10 feet per second, the drag force on your body is about the same as flying through air at nearly 200 mph. It's an exhilarating experience that feels powerful and smooth.",
      "The 2025 redesign also trimmed some weight from the original, reducing it from approximately 33 pounds to just over 30 pounds, including the harness. The harness itself comes in four sizes, so you can get a fit that feels just right. Safety is clearly a priority as well. Each CudaJet ships with a factory-set safety depth of about 10 feet, which you can adjust up to the full 131 feet if you're feeling adventurous. If you ever go past your set limit, the motor cuts out and floats you right back to the surface. The controller's full-color display keeps you updated on your speed, battery and depth at all times.",

Each jetpack is made to order, handcrafted and painted in the U.K. The\u00a02025 package starts at around $31,000, which is a jump from the original price, but it now includes a two-year warranty, a luxury hard case and a fast charger. For those who want something even more exclusive, there's a Founder's Edition with lifetime product access, in-water training with the founder and a lifetime warranty, but only 20 of those are being made.",

      "Since each CudaJet is made to order, buyers should expect a personalized experience. The process involves custom-fitting the harness to your size and selecting your preferred finish, all of which are handcrafted in the U.K. Due to this approach, there is typically a wait time before delivery, which varies depending on demand and the customization options.

    "summary": "Protect yourself from login alert scams with five security steps, including avoiding suspicious links, checking account activity and enabling two-factor authentication",
    "story": [
      "The CyberGuy explains steps you can take to protect yourself from scams.",
      "Online scams thrive on the urgency and fear of their victims. If you've ever been a victim of a scam, you\u2019d know that bad actors often try to rush you into taking action by creating a sense of fear. A scammer may call you impersonating a government agency and claim your Social Security number has been linked to drug trafficking.",
      "A phishing email might ask you to update your tax details or claim you\u2019ve won a lottery or a free product, all to get you to click a malicious link.",
      "A more effective tactic scammers use is sending fake login alerts. These are warnings that someone has logged into your account, prompting you to take immediate action. This method works well because legitimate services like Google, Apple, Netflix and Facebook also send these types of notifications when someone, including you, logs in from a new device. It can be tricky to tell the difference.",
      "As Robert from Danville asks, \"I constantly get in my spam junk folder emails saying 'someone has logged into your account.' Is this spam? legitimate? concerning? How do I know? How to avoid wasting time checking? How do I check?\"",
      "Join The FREE CyberGuy Report: Get my expert tech tips, critical security alerts and exclusive deals \u2014 plus instant access to my\u00a0free Ultimate Scam Survival Guide when you sign up!",
      "Thanks for writing to us, Robert. I completely understand how tricky it can be to figure out whether these messages are legitimate or just another scam attempt. Let's break down what these urgent warnings usually look like and go over a few ways you can stay safe.",
      "A person logging into a Gmail account on a laptop\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How login alert scams work and why they\u2019re so effective",
      "Scammers often pose as login alerts from Google, Apple, Meta or even your bank, complete with official-looking logos, because fear is effective. But not every alert is a scam. In many cases, these notifications are legitimate and can help you detect unauthorized access to your accounts. Let\u2019s focus on the scam side first.",
      "Login alert scams have been around for a while. Early reports date back to 2021, and the trend has persisted since then. In 2022, reports surfaced that scammers were impersonating Meta and sending phishing emails to users.",
      "FBI WARNS OF SCAM TARGETING VICTIMS WITH FAKE HOSPITALS AND POLICE",
      "One such email used a clean layout with minimal text. It avoided the usual scare tactics and stuck to a simple message. But that is not always the case. A common red flag in phishing attempts is the tendency to overload the email with unnecessary details. These messages often include cluttered formatting, excessive explanations and an increasing number of typos or design errors. One phishing email simply gets to the point:",
      "Someone tried to Iog into Your Account, User lD",
      "A user just logged into your Facebook account from a new device Samsung S21. We are sending you this email to verify it\u2019s really you.",
      "Thanks,",
      "The Facebook Team",
      "What\u2019s concerning now is that poor grammar is no longer a reliable sign of a scam. Thanks to AI, even those with limited English skills can write emails that sound polished and professional. As a result, many phishing messages today read just like legitimate emails from trusted companies.",
      "Receiving a phishing email is not the real issue. The real problem starts when you click on it. Most of these emails contain links that lead to fake login pages, designed to look exactly like platforms such as Facebook, Google or your bank.",
      "If you enter your credentials there, they go directly to the scammer. In some cases, simply clicking the link can trigger a malware download, especially if your browser is outdated or your device lacks proper security. Once inside, attackers can steal personal information, monitor your activity or take control of your accounts.",

      "How to tell if a login alert is real or fake",
      "Real login notifications\u00a0do exist; they\u2019re just much less scary. A genuine alert from Google, Apple or Microsoft will come from an official address (for example, no-reply@accounts.google.com or security@apple.com) and use consistent branding. The tone is factual and helpful.",
      "For instance, a legit Google security alert might say, \"We detected a login from a new sign-in to your Google Account on a Pixel 6 Pro device. If this was you, you don't need to do anything. If not, we'll help you secure your account.\"\u00a0\u00a0It may include a \"Check activity\" button, but that link always redirects to a google.com address, and it won\u2019t prompt you to reenter your password via the email link. Similarly, Apple notes it will never ask for passwords or verification codes via email.",

      "FBI WARNS OF SCAM TARGETING VICTIMS WITH FAKE HOSPITALS AND POLICE",
      "What to do if you get a suspicious login alert email",
      "1. Don\u2019t click any links or attachments and use strong antivirus software: Instead, manually log in to the real site (or open the official app) by typing the URL or using a bookmarked link. This guarantees you\u2019re not walking into a scammer\u2019s trap. The FTC recommends this: if you have an account with that company, contact them via the website or phone number you know is real,\u00a0not the info in the email.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "2. Remove your data from the internet: Scammers are able to send you targeted messages because your data, like your email address or phone number, is already out there. This often happens due to past data breaches and shady data brokers. A data removal service can help clean up your digital trail by removing your information from public databases and people-search sites. It\u2019s not a quick fix, but over time, it reduces how easily scammers can find and target you.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice.\u00a0They aren\u2019t cheap, and neither is your privacy.\u00a0These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It\u2019s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.\u00a0By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",

      "Get a\u00a0free scan\u00a0to find out if your personal information is already out on the web.",
      "3. Check your account activity:\u00a0Go to your account\u2019s security or sign-in page. Services like Gmail, iCloud or your bank let you review recent logins and devices. If you see nothing unusual, you\u2019re safe. If you do find a strange login, follow the site\u2019s process (usually changing your password and logging out all devices). Even if you don\u2019t find anything odd, change your password as a precaution. Do it through the official site or app, not the email. Consider using a\u00a0password manager to generate and store complex passwords.",
      "4. Enable two-factor authentication (2FA): This is your best backup. With\u00a02FA enabled, even if someone has your password, they can\u2019t gain access without your phone and an additional second factor. Both Google and Apple make 2FA easy and say it \"makes it harder for scammers\" to hijack your account.",
      "5. Report suspicious emails: If you receive a suspicious email claiming to be from a specific organization, report it to that organization\u2019s official support or security team so they can take appropriate action.",
      "THIS IS WHAT YOU ARE DOING WRONG WHEN SCAMMERS CALL",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "You shouldn\u2019t have to vet every sketchy email. In fact, your email\u2019s spam filters catch most phishing attempts for you. Keep them enabled, and make sure your software is up to date so that malicious sites and attachments are blocked. Still, the most powerful filter is your own awareness. You're definitely not alone in this. People receive these spammy login scares every day. By keeping a cool head and following the steps above, you're already ahead of the game.",

      "May 7 is the deadline to get a REAL ID, and some DMVs are facing large crowds and major backup. FOX's Asher Reed spoke with FOX 35 Orlando from outside a DMV in Antioch, Tennessee, with more on the issue.",
      "If you've received a text message claiming to be from your state's Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) and threatening you with fines or penalties unless you pay up, you're not alone. A new wave of scam texts is sweeping across the country, targeting drivers in states like Connecticut, Pennsylvania, Georgia, Florida, New York, California, Illinois, New Jersey, Virginia, Colorado, Vermont, Texas, North Carolina and even Washington, D.C.",
      "These messages look official and urgent, warning you about supposed unpaid tickets or tolls and demanding immediate payment. But don't be fooled, as these texts are sophisticated scams designed to steal your personal information or money.",

      "How the DMV scam text message works",
      "These scam messages vary slightly depending on the state you're in, but they\u2019re generally structured in the same way. The text threatens consequences, such as credit score damage, revoked driving privileges, suspended vehicle registration or increased toll fees, if you do not pay the bill you have supposedly incurred. To make the message appear legit, the scammers often include a date for penalties to begin, a fake administrative code and a link that appears to be an official DMV website.",

      "Why DMV text scams are so convincing",
      "The scam relies on two key elements to be effective:\u00a0fear and a sense of urgency. These are two powerful psychological motivators that can send you into a panic since your driving privileges are at risk, or you're facing financial consequences. The aim is to get you to act hastily without pausing to verify the source. The messages also mimic legitimate government communications by including familiar terms, official-sounding codes and web addresses that appear authentic. Here is an example of what the text might look like:",

      "How to spot and avoid DMV text message scams",
      "If you receive a suspicious text message claiming to be from your state's DMV and demanding payment or personal information, follow these steps to protect yourself:",
      "1. Be skeptical of any message creating urgency or panic: Scammers rely on fear and urgency to trick you into acting without thinking. If a message pressures you to act immediately, that's a major red flag.",
      "2. Check for obvious red flags: Look for signs like strange sender addresses, awkward language, misspellings or links that don't match your state's official DMV website.",
      "3. Do not click any links or reply, and use strong antivirus software: Legitimate DMVs will not ask for payments, personal details or sensitive information via unsolicited text messages. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "4. Verify directly with your DMV: If you're concerned the message might be real, contact your state's DMV using the official website or a trusted phone number. Never use the contact information provided in the suspicious text.",
      "5. Consider a Personal Data Removal Service:\u00a0Your personal information is widely available online, which can make you a bigger target for these types of scams, therefore you might look into a personal data removal service. These services work by submitting opt-out requests to data brokers that collect and sell your information, helping to reduce your digital footprint and making it harder for scammers to find your contact details.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren\u2019t cheap \u2014 and neither is your privacy.\u00a0 These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It\u2019s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.\u00a0 By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "6. Delete the message immediately and block the sender: Removing the text helps prevent accidental clicks and reduces the risk of falling for the scam later. Also, be sure to\u00a0block phone numbers and texts that send spam or scam messages, reducing future risk.",
      "7. Register your number with the\u00a0National Do Not Call Registry: While this won't stop all scams, it can help reduce unwanted communications.",
      "8. Don't provide any personal or financial information: Never share your Social Security number, driver's license number, banking information, or passwords in response to an unsolicited text.",
      "9. If you clicked the link or gave out information, act quickly: If you accidentally entered personal or financial information, contact your bank, credit card provider or local law enforcement right away to minimize potential damage.",
      "10. Keep your phone's security features updated: Ensure your\u00a0device's operating system and security software are current to help block known scam numbers and malicious links.",
      "11. Report the scam:\u00a0Forward the message to 7726 (SPAM) to alert your mobile provider and help block similar messages in the future. Mark the message as junk or spam within your messaging app, if possible. File a complaint with the Federal Trade Commission at\u00a0reportfraud.ftc.gov or the FBI's Internet Crime Complaint Center at\u00a0ic3.gov.",
      "DON\u2019T GET CAUGHT IN THE \"APPLE ID SUSPENDED\" PHISHING SCAM",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaways",
      "Scam texts pretending to be from the DMV are getting more convincing, but you don't have to be their next victim. Staying skeptical of urgent messages, double-checking anything that seems off and never clicking suspicious links can go a long way in protecting your personal information. Remember, the real DMV will never pressure you for payment or sensitive details over text. By staying alert, you can help prevent these scams and keep your personal information and money secure.",

    "story": [
      "E-BAR operates as a set of robotic handlebars that follow users.",
      "The demographic landscape in the U.S. is shifting rapidly, with the median age now at 38.9, almost a decade older than it was in 1980.",
      "By 2050, the population of adults over 65 is projected to surge from 58 million to 82 million, intensifying the already urgent challenge of eldercare. With falls remaining the top cause of injury among older adults, the need for innovative, tech-driven solutions has never been clearer.",

      "How MIT\u2019s E-BAR robot helps prevent falls and support senior mobility",
      "E-BAR, short for\u00a0Elderly Bodily Assistance Robot, is not your typical assistive device. Rather than relying on harnesses or wearables, which many seniors find cumbersome or stigmatizing, E-BAR operates as a set of robotic handlebars that follow users from behind. This allows individuals to walk freely, lean on the robot's arms for support or receive full-body assistance when transitioning between sitting and standing. The robot's articulated body, constructed from 18 interconnected bars, mimics the natural movement of the human body, delivering a seamless and intuitive experience.",
      "AI ROBOTS HELP NURSES BEAT BURNOUT AND TRANSFORM HOSPITAL CARE",
      "The engineering behind E-BAR's mobility is equally impressive. The robot's 220-pound base is meticulously designed to support the weight of an average adult without tipping or slipping, and its omnidirectional wheels enable smooth navigation through tight spaces and around household obstacles. This means E-BAR can move effortlessly alongside users, providing support in real time, whether they are reaching for a high shelf or stepping out of a bathtub.",

      "BEST CREDIT CARDS FOR SENIORS AND RETIREES 2025",
      "Inside MIT\u2019s E-BAR: A fall-prevention robot designed for aging in place",
      "What sets E-BAR apart from previous eldercare robots is its integrated fall-prevention system. Each arm is embedded with airbags made from soft, grippable materials that can inflate instantly if a fall is detected. This rapid response cushions the user without causing bruising, and, crucially, it does so without requiring the user to wear any special gear. In lab tests, E-BAR successfully supported elderly volunteers as they performed everyday tasks that often pose a risk for falls, such as bending down, stretching up or navigating the tricky edge of a bathtub.",
      "Currently, E-BAR is operated via remote control, but the MIT team is already working on automating its navigation and assistance features. The vision is for future versions to autonomously follow users, assess their real-time fall risk using machine learning algorithms and provide adaptive support as their mobility needs evolve.",

      "The E-BAR project is rooted in extensive interviews with seniors and caregivers, which revealed a strong preference for unobtrusive, non-restrictive support systems. E-BAR's U-shaped handlebars leave the front of the user completely open, allowing for a natural stride and easy exit at any time. The robot is slim enough to fit through standard doorways and is designed to blend into the home environment, making it a practical addition rather than an intrusive medical device.",
      "MIT researchers see E-BAR as part of a broader ecosystem of assistive technologies, each tailored to different stages of aging and mobility. While some devices may offer predictive fall detection or harness-based support, E-BAR's unique combination of full-body assistance, fall prevention and user autonomy addresses a critical gap for those who want to maintain independence but need occasional support.",

The research team is continuing to refine the design and aims to bring it to market in the coming years, but it could take 5\u201310 years before the device receives full regulatory approval and becomes commercially accessible.",
      "Looking forward, the research team is also focused on refining E-BAR's design to make it slimmer, more maneuverable and even more intuitive to use. They are also exploring ways to integrate advanced AI for real-time fall prediction and adaptive assistance, ensuring that the robot can meet users' changing needs as they age.

      "\"Now we have a very conservative, hard-charging DA in Los Angeles,\" Wohl said. \"He\u2019s adding up what is stolen by each individual co-defendant, and if that\u2019s over $950, everybody\u2019s getting charged with felonies.\"",

      "In 2020, the IAEA found man-made particles of enriched uranium at three sites, including Varamin, Marivan and Turquzabad. The locations were previously utilized in Iran\u2019s nuclear program and gave the agency credence to believe Tehran had once again turned to deadly nuclear ambitions.",
      "\"Since then, we have been seeking explanations and clarifications from Iran for the presence of these uranium particles, including through a number of high-level meetings and consultations in which I have been personally involved,\" Grossi said. \"Unfortunately, Iran has repeatedly either not answered, or not provided technically credible answers to, the Agency\u2019s questions.",

    "story": [
      "It was approaching nightfall in Los Angeles on Sunday when black-clad demonstrators began to torch a row of self-driving Waymo taxis. Within minutes, videos of the fiery scenes began to pop up on social media.",
      "\u201cMORE. MORE AND MORE AND MORE,\u201d a group known as Unity of Fields posted on X, along with a video of the flaming vehicles.",
      "The post wasn\u2019t an anomaly. Since the start of the demonstrations against immigration raids in Los Angeles, the Unity of Fields X account has been pumping out messages urging people to wreak havoc in the streets and \u201cgive 'em hell.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s part of a far-left online ecosystem that has proliferated in recent years, experts say. Some of the groups behind the accounts express contempt for peaceful resistance and glorify acts of violence \u2014 and even murders, like those of the UnitedHealthcare CEO and two Israeli Embassy staffers.",
      "The leftist networks tend to be different from right-wing groups in that they are typically decentralized with no leadership structures. But they can be highly adept at using social media, and some have been working hard to amplify and celebrate the acts of violent protesters in Los Angeles.",
      "\u201cWhether they directly threw a Molotov cocktail is actually not as essential as the ecosystem of encouragement and coordination they have created,\u201d said Joel Finkelstein, a co-founder of the Network Contagion Research Institute, a nonpartisan group that tracks online extremism.",
      "The unrest in Los Angeles follows a pattern that has played out in numerous cities over the past five years in which protests that break out remain mostly peaceful during the day, but at night agitators engage in fiery clashes with police.",
      "That dynamic tends to distract from the focus of the demonstrations \u2014 in this case, workplace immigration raids by federal agents \u2014 and provide fodder to people who oppose them. In this case, that\u2019s President Donald Trump and his supporters, who have sought to dismiss the broader protest movement as the work of \u201cpaid insurrectionists.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhat\u2019s concerning is the attempt to conflate the individual actors who do commit violence with the mass movement as a whole,\u201d said Jon Lewis, a research fellow at the Program on Extremism at George Washington University.",
      "He said the narrative pushed by some people on the right \u2014 in his words, that there\u2019s a \u201croving band of antifa groupies who are following protests from city to city\u201d \u2014 doesn\u2019t comport with reality.",
      "But, Lewis added, there has no doubt been a normalization of violence in parts of the left, although it is more fractured than in right-wing groups.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a little bit of anti-capitalist stuff in one case. A little bit of antisemitic stuff in another case,\u201d he said. \u201cI think that reflects the nature of those online leftist movements where there is no cohesive, central structure.\u201d",
      "More than 300 people have been arrested since the demonstrations broke out Friday in Los Angeles, police say. The charges include failure to disperse, looting, arson and attacks on police officers. Police Chief Jim McDonnell said demonstrators have shot commercial-grade fireworks at police officers and hurled pieces of concrete at them.",
      "Were they the acts of lone wolves seizing an opportunity to target police? Or was there a level of coordination and planning among the instigators?",
      "Experts say it\u2019s likely to be a combination of both.",
      "\u201cYou have the organized protests by people who are committed to a particular cause, and then you have radical fringes,\u201d said Daniel Byman, the director of the Warfare, Irregular Threats and Terrorism Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.",
      "\u201cThey might put on airs and call themselves anarchists or something like that, but they\u2019re young people who like destruction.\u201d",
      "The Network Contagion Research Institute has been analyzing the rise of what it calls \u201canarcho-socialist extremism.\u201d It has found that the chaos and violence that have broken out at some of the major protests in recent years, like those against the police killing of George Floyd in 2020, weren\u2019t as spontaneous as they might have seemed.",
      "\u201cWhat we found in our research is there are groups that were attempting to exploit the situation, oftentimes after dark, and their coordination was somewhat sophisticated,\u201d said Alex Goldenberg, a senior adviser to the Network Contagion Research Institute.",
      "That involved demonstrators\u2019 surveilling police movements and sharing tips about making the most destructive Molotov cocktails, Goldenberg said.",
      "\u201cThey were trying to exploit an already volatile situation in an attempt to provoke violent clashes with police, create viral moments to inflame tensions and draw in others through emotional triggers,\u201d he said.",
      "Soon after it launched in 2019, the Network Contagion Research Institute focused on right-wing threats like the Boogaloos, a loose-knit anti-government movement that calls for violence against law enforcement and political opponents. But it soon found that left-wing groups were using many of the same tactics to incite violence.",
      "A 2022 report by the institute found that animus toward law enforcement among anarchist types had been proliferating online for years. The appearance of posts with anti-police outrage and/or memes and coded language increased over 1,000% on Twitter and 300% on Reddit during the period of the Floyd protests in 2020, the report found.",
      "\u2018Assassination culture\u2019",
      "One anti-police group, the People\u2019s City Council Los Angeles, has taken to calling out the actions of officers at the protests, using expletives and slights.",
      "Just before 1 a.m. Tuesday, it posted on X the name and picture of a police officer it said was firing rubber bullets at protesters.",
      "He is \u201cf-----g unhinged and unloading on protesters at point blank range,\u201d the post read. \u201cF--K THIS PIG!!\u201d",
      "On Sunday, the group posted a video showing a line of police officers in riot gear.",
      "\u201cLAPD trying to kettle right now,\u201d the group wrote, referring to a crowd control tactic used by police. \u201cOink oink piggy piggy, we going make your life s----y \u2026 \u201d",
      "The violent demonstrators seemed to represent a mishmash of causes.",
      "Many of the people seen hurling objects at police and setting fires were dressed all in black, their faces covered in masks. Some waved Mexican flags, others Palestinian flags. At least one man was photographed wearing a Hamas armband.",
      "\u201cAngelenos throwing Modelo Molotovs at ICE while wearing Keffiyehs,\u201d read a post on X by Unity of Fields. \u201cWe are locked the f--- in, folks.\u201d",
      "Unity of Fields, which was formerly known as Palestine Action US, describes itself as a \u201cmilitant front against the US-NATO-zionist axis of imperialism.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe Unity of Fields concept comes from the Palestinian resistance,\u201d the group said last year in a blog post announcing the name change. \u201cIt refers to the coordination between all the factions on the battlefield despite their geographic fragmentation or ideological differences.\u201d",
      "Finkelstein, the co-founder of the Network Contagion Research Institute, said such groups and the people who follow them represent what he described as \u201cassassination culture\u201d \u2014 in which targeted killings are considered acceptable by those who harbor an array of grievances.",
      "Unity of Fields, for example, is helping raise money to cover legal costs for Elias Rodriguez, the Chicago man accused of fatally shooting the Israeli Embassy workers outside the Capital Jewish Museum in Washington last month.",
      "\u201cMy sense is that beneath these grievances is a shared sense of loss of control,\u201d said Finkelstein, who is a psychologist and a neuroscientist. \u201cWho are the people that really feel a sense of hopelessness in their lives? Most are looking for significance, and they think they found it here.\u201d",
      "In response to a request for comment, Unity of Fields wrote: \u201cWe will never condemn people who fight to free themselves. When the masses in Los Angeles began using direct action as a means of halting ICE-gestapo disappearances, the media saw only the violence of resistance and never the violence of the status quo.\u201d",
      "It added: \u201cAll acts of resistance to state violence are justified and all power belongs to the masses.\u201d",
      "The People\u2019s City Council Los Angeles didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.",
      "While the violent parts of the protests in Los Angeles began to die down Monday, demonstrations against the Trump administration\u2019s crackdown on undocumented immigrants have spread to several other cities, including Boston, Chicago, Dallas and New York.",
      "So far, none has experienced violence at the levels in Los Angeles, but whether that will remain the case is an open question. Unity of Fields has made it clear it\u2019s hoping for a repeat in cities like New York.",
      "\u201cNYC, how are you gonna let Angelenos beat you at your favorite pastime (terrorizing police officers)?\u201d the group said Monday on X. \u201cHamas Marxist Army get down there and show them what New Yorkers can do when they put their heads together!\""

      "The inspiration for the McClintock Letters took root in February, when Isako Di Tomassi, a doctoral student studying plant pathology, vented online about losing her Ph.D. adviser at the U.S. Department of Agriculture after widespread government layoffs this year.",
      "Some online commenters were sympathetic, Di Tomassi said, but one person insisted that the cuts had stopped \u201cstupid research,\u201d and many others expressed confusion as to what universities were even studying. Few seemed to see the value in their work.",
      "Di Tomassi and Scales brainstormed with the Cornell Advancing Science and Policy Club about what to do in response and landed on the idea of having researchers tell their own stories.",
      "They named their effort after Barbara McClintock, the late Cornell cytogeneticist who won a Nobel Prize, and planned it around her birthday, June 16. Her research on the genes in corn changed scientists\u2019 understanding of heredity and laid the foundation for treating genetic defects in humans.",
      "\u201cBarbara McClintock is famous as hell,\u201d Di Tomassi said, \u201cbut maybe not to a nonscientist because she studied corn DNA. So most people will be like, \u2018Who cares about corn DNA?\u2019\u201d",
      "But that\u2019s exactly the point, Di Tomassi said: bridging the disconnect between what the scientific community knows and what the average person understands. Even mundane-sounding experiments can help fuel medical and scientific breakthroughs, she said.",
      "Researchers have signed up to write about breast cancer metastasis, how memories are formed and sustainable grape-harvesting, among other things. They are on track to reach 8 million potential readers, based on the organizers\u2019 back-of-the-envelope calculations of each news outlet\u2019s audience size.",
      "During a June 6 webinar, Katherine Xue, a microbiologist at the University of California, Irvine, walked some 100 people through how to write an op-ed. She showed them a 2015 op-ed by Newt Gingrich that called for more research funding as a template.",
      "Xue reminded them to avoid jargon and make it personal. She plans to write for a newspaper in her hometown of Oak Ridge, Tennessee, about how a high school internship got her interested in microbiology.",
      "\u201cAs scientists, we\u2019re trained to stay impersonal and to take ourselves out of the equation,\u201d Xue told NBC News. But there\u2019s a downside to that approach, she said. \u201cI think a lot of people haven\u2019t met scientists and don\u2019t know a lot about what we do and why, which means it\u2019s easy to distrust science as a whole.\u201d",
      "Recent polling backs up her point. While 76% of Americans have confidence in scientists, that\u2019s down from 87% in 2020, surveys by the Pew Research Center show. Pew also found a majority of Americans believe that scientists are not good communicators, and that nearly half think scientists view themselves as superior to others.",
      "Silly-sounding research projects have long been a political punching bag. Some senators have issued annual reports flagging what they consider wasteful spending on science.",
      "During Trump\u2019s March speech to Congress, he rattled off a list of what he deemed ridiculous projects funded by the Biden administration, including research he incorrectly described as making mice transgender (it actually looked at the role of hormones in health and fertility). The White House defended the president\u2019s remarks.",
      "In response to questions about research cuts, White House spokesman Kush Desai said they were in line with what voters want. \u201cThe American people gave President Trump a resounding mandate to realign government spending to better reflect their priorities,\u201d he wrote in an email. \u201cThe Administration is committed to delivering on this mandate.\u201d",
      "For her new book, \u201cThe Salmon Cannon and the Levitating Frog,\u201d Carly Anne York, an animal behaviorist at Lenoir-Rhyne University in North Carolina, profiled a handful of scientists who have engaged directly with disparagers to defend their research.",
      "One professor profiled in the book responded to mockery of her work as \u201cShrimp Fight Club\u201d by joining other academics in setting up a mini-science fair on Capitol Hill, where she shared that the research into how shrimp fight had generated interest in designing new types of body armor for humans.",
      "\u201cI wish that more scientists would think that way,\u201d York said. \u201cThis is actually our burden to make sure the public understands why their taxpayer dollars go to us, what we do with it, and why what we do matters.\u201d",
      "So will the McClintock Letters or other campaigns work? Students and faculty members planning to participate aren\u2019t sure, but many say that\u2019s not the only goal \u2014 and hope they go further.",

    "story": [
      "Renting is taking off in the suburbs as homeownership remains out of reach for many would-be buyers.",
      "Between 2018 and 2023, rentership surged by at least 5 percentage points in 11 out of 20 suburbs surrounding the largest U.S. metro areas, according to a recent analysis by Point2Homes, a rental market research company.",
      "During the same period, 15 suburbs went from being predominantly composed of homeowners to majority-renter communities. The trend spans fast-growing Sun Belt metros like Dallas, Houston and Miami as well as Northeastern cities like Boston and Philadelphia.",
      "In five of those top 20 metro areas \u2014 Dallas, Minneapolis, Boston, Tampa and Baltimore \u2014 the suburbs are gaining renters faster than the urban centers they surround, Point2Homes found. The share of residents who rent surged in the Dallas suburbs by 17.6% from 2018 to 2023, while that rate rose just 7.9% in the city itself \u2014 with the nearby suburbs of Frisco, McKinney and Grand Prairie each gaining over 5,000 renter households apiece during that period.",
      "Back in 2018, it was harder to buy a home in Dallas County, where most of the city sits, than it was in the metro area\u2019s more suburban counties, like those including Frisco, McKinney and Grand Prairie \u2014 suburbs where the ranks of renters have swelled faster than virtually anywhere else, Point2Homes found. That\u2019s no longer the case: Homebuying is now more difficult in the suburban counties surrounding Dallas than it is in Dallas County itself, the NBC News Home Buyer Index shows.",
      "Housing affordability is a nationwide problem spanning cities and suburbs alike.",
      "Mortgage costs have risen sharply since the pandemic, pricing out many prospective buyers in all sorts of in-demand areas. Average interest rates on the popular 30-year fixed home loan currently hover just under 7%, levels not seen since before the 2008 financial crisis. In a market this tough, some housing experts say the proliferation of rental properties has helped keep suburban lifestyles accessible to people who otherwise couldn\u2019t afford them.",
      "\u201cYou have your own land, you have kids or you have a dog, and you want that space,\u201d said N. Edward Coulson, a professor at the University of California, Irvine, and the director of its Center for Real Estate. \u201cThey get all that amenity from having a single-family home.\u201d",
      "Mark, a suburbanite just outside Chicago who asked to be identified by his first name to avoid professional blowback for weighing in on hot-button housing issues, said the type of property he has rented for three years is out of budget for him to buy. He estimated many comparable properties in the area would cost 30% more in monthly housing payments than his current rent, and he\u2019s considering leaving the area so he can purchase someplace else.",
      "\u201cIf I want to stay here, it\u2019s basically not tenable,\u201d Mark said.",
      "Andrew Decker, a renter in Lake Villa, Illinois, halfway between Chicago and Milwaukee, said he and his family would love to buy the property where they live now, which he said was offered to him for $340,000.",
      "\u201cWe would like to make it our forever home if we could afford it, but it\u2019s just so expensive,\u201d Decker said. \u201cIf they were to come at me and tell me that, \u2018Hey, you can buy this house for 200 grand today,\u2019 I\u2019d pull the trigger tomorrow. I wouldn\u2019t even hesitate. But 340\u2019s crazy.\u201d",
      "Tara Raghuveer, who runs the tenant advocacy group Tenant Union Federation, said affordability issues that have fueled the suburban rental boom threaten to push people farther from urban cores.",
      "\u201cAs people are moved out of the city, they\u2019re further from transportation, they might be further from employment, they might be living in homes that are not necessarily connected to other people like them, which impacts things like child care, Social Security,\u201d Raghuveer said.",
      "Landlords, however, tout the benefits that come from renting in the \u2019burbs.",
      "\u201cThe ability to have one payment that covers all your expenses generally \u2014 you don\u2019t have to deal with the mortgage payment and the home insurance and maybe the HOA and then a lot of maintenance expense, so on \u2014 has been something that for a lot of people has been worth it,\u201d said George Ratiu, vice president of research at the National Apartment Association trade group, which represents rental operators.",
      "Developers have also been building different types of properties for suburban tenants, including multifamily complexes. Jay Parsons, a housing economist and host of \u201cThe Rent Roll\u201d podcast, points to the rise of \u201csuburban downtowns,\u201d partly fueled by the pandemic-era shift to remote work. These mixed-use developments are typically aimed at offering younger families a balance between urban convenience and suburban amenities, he said.",
      "\u201cYou can still be close to your job. You can be close to nice restaurants and shops but live in a suburban area where you\u2019re still using a car, and you still have probably a rent that\u2019s more affordable than living in most downtowns,\u201d Parsons said.",
      "Coulson doesn\u2019t expect the appeal of the suburbs to fade anytime soon, which could prop up prices in many of them for buyers and renters alike.",
      "\u201cIf you work downtown, it\u2019s still an advantage to live downtown, but it\u2019s not as great an advantage\u201d as it used to be, he said, now that remote work remains commonplace \u2014 despite an ongoing drumbeat of return-to-office mandates. \u201cWhat that does is also raise the cost of living in the suburbs, because now more people want to live in the suburbs.\u201d",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s a dynamic that\u2019s going to have to work itself out a little bit more before we know the final impact on suburban versus downtown pricing,\u201d he said."

      "Some residents of Ballymena, about 25 miles northwest of Belfast with a population of 30,000, responded to the anti-foreigner vigilantism by sticking the Union Jack or signs in their windows reading \u201cBritish household\u201d and \u201clocals live here,\u201d in an apparent attempt to be spared by the rioters.",
      "NBC News\u2019 British partner Sky News has seen residents from ethnic minorities packing up suitcases and leaving their homes, while others have spoken of their terror that the mob violence will continue.",
      "The violence first flared Monday during a vigil for a teenage girl who was the victim of an alleged sexual assault two days before. Two teenage boys, both 14, were charged with  attempted rape and appeared in court Monday, communicating through a Romanian translator. The boys' identities have not been released because of their age.",

      "\u201cThis violence was clearly racially motivated and targeted at our minority ethnic community and police,\u201d Ryan Henderson, PSNI assistant chief constable, said Tuesday at a news conference. \u201cIt was racist thuggery pure and simple and any attempt to justify and explain it as something else is misplaced.\u201d",

      "The unanimous decision written by Justice Neil Gorsuch means they can continue to press claims alleging assault, battery and false imprisonment under a law called the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA), one of the few avenues to hold federal officials accountable. Litigation will now continue in the Atlanta-based 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.",
      "\"We look forward to continuing this fight with the Martins in the Eleventh Circuit and making it easier for everyday people to hold the government accountable for its mistaken and intentional violations of individual rights,\" Patrick Jaicomo, a lawyer at the libertarian Institute for Justice who represents the plaintiffs, said in a statement.",
      "The case highlights the problem of law enforcement raiding the wrong house, which has happened in several high-profile cases.",
      "A district court judge and the appeals court ruled for the government.",
      "The legal question touched upon on whether a particular provision of the law, which allows claims concerning the actions of federal law enforcement officers, is trumped in this instance by another provision called \u201cthe discretionary function exception,\u201d which protects certain judgment calls from liability.",
      "The court did not resolve that question, but did remove a barrier to the plaintiffs being able to argue it in lower courts.",

      "Justin Sherman, a nonresident senior fellow at the Atlantic Council who studies data privacy, told NBC News that using a Chinese-owned VPN would be tantamount to handing over one\u2019s browsing history to Beijing.",
      "\u201cCapturing data via a VPN could let the Chinese government see everything from websites a person is reading that criticize the Chinese state, to the corporate databases and private portals that person might pull up (and then log into) on the internet for work,\u201d he said.",
      "The TTP, a tech-focused arm of the Campaign for Accountability, an investigative nonprofit that seeks to expose \u201ccorruption, negligence, and unethical behavior,\u201d previously published a report on Chinese VPN apps on April 1. Apple soon took down three of the apps with alleged ties to Qihoo 360: Thunder VPN, Snap VPN and Signal Secure VPN. The other apps \u2014 Turbo VPN and VPN Proxy Master, which are also available on the Google Play Store, as well as three others that Google offers \u2014 are all still available.",
      "None of the apps are listed as being developed directly by Qihoo 360. Instead, they are developed by Singapore-based companies including Lemon Seed, Lemon Clove, Autumn Breeze and Innovative Connecting. The TTP cited business filings in China that show Qihoo 360 saying it had acquired those companies in 2019, and Corporate registration documents for those companies in the Cayman Islands from March that all list the director as a Chinese citizen who is a top Qihoo 360 employee.",
      "NBC News reached out to developers listed for the 17 apps. Only two claimed not to have ties to China or Qihoo 360. Autumn Breeze, the developer of Snap VPN, which Apple previously removed but is still available on the Google Play store, told TTP it has \"no affiliation with Qihoo 360\" despite those registration documents, and claims it does not \"record, monitor, or retain any user online activity.\"",
      "\"Autumn Breeze fails to explain clear connections to the sanctioned PLA-linked entity that are detailed in publicly available documents,\" Paul told NBC News.",
      "The other is WireVPN, where an employee claimed in an email to NBC News that the company is \u201can independent service\u201d with \u201cno ties to Chinese entities or government organizations.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe are neither affiliated with Qihoo 360 nor any other PRC-based enterprises, and our operations are entirely autonomous,\u201d the employee said.",
      "However, WireVPN\u2019s privacy policy makes clear that users are expected to adhere to Chinese law and bans them from \u201cViolating the basic principles established by the Chinese Constitution\u201d and \u201cViolating the traditional virtues of the Chinese nation, social morality, rational morality, and socialist spiritual civilization.\u201d",
      "Qihoo 360 didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment. But China Daily, a state-run newspaper, has reported that its cybersecurity clients include the Chinese military and \u201cat least eight ministries\u201d of the Chinese government. In a 2016 press release, the company seemed to indicate it was in the VPN business, saying \u201cQihoo 360 also provides users with secure access points to the Internet via its market leading web browsers and application stores.\u201d",
      "Both Apple and Google declined to address the specific apps that TTP highlighted as tied to Qihoo 360 and told NBC News that they follow U.S. laws regarding sanctions. Neither bans VPN app developers simply for following Chinese law.",
      "Peter Micek, general counsel at Access Now, a tech policy and human rights advocacy nonprofit, told NBC News that he was surprised to see the tech companies had potentially overlooked a sanctioned company offering apps under innocuous developer names.",
      "\u201cIt seems like this project has done the homework and due diligence that Apple and Google should have done, and it does seem like those ties would constitute indirect contact with, transactions with folks who are sanctioned,\u201d he said. Tech companies can sometimes face significant fines for violating sanctions, Micek said.",
      "Sanctions are put in place by the federal government as a penalty on foreign entities and individuals, preventing U.S. companies and individuals from doing business with them. They are often imposed after a foreign entity or individual is shown to have conducted some sort of condemned behavior or have links to condemned groups, such as cybercriminals or terrorist organizations. Qihoo 360 faced sanctions from the Commerce Department in 2020, which said the company could become involved in supplying materials to the Chinese military. The sanctions prevent American companies from exporting technology or software to Qihoo 360. It\u2019s not clear if app stores hosting apps tied to Qihoo could be in violation of those sanctions.",
      "The Commerce Department did not respond to a request for comment."

    "summary": "The 11-year-old girl's symptoms have worsened since the mixed-immigration status family was deported to Mexico, the mother told NBC News.",
    "story": [
      "An 11-year-old girl who is a U.S. citizen and is recovering from a rare brain tumor has been living in Mexico since immigration authorities removed her from Texas when they deported her undocumented parents four months ago.",
      "Four of her siblings, three of whom are also U.S. citizens, were also sent to Mexico with the parents.",
      "Since then, the girl\u2019s health condition has not improved, her mother told NBC News. In an attempt to return to the United States to get her the care she needs, the family applied for humanitarian parole with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) on Thursday.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re fighting for my girl\u2019s life,\" the mother said, adding that her daughter isn't recovering from \"just any disease. ... She is not going to be cured overnight; it\u2019s something that takes time.\u201d",
      "Their request is for the undocumented parents and the girl's noncitizen sibling to be allowed to enter and live in the U.S. temporarily, so that the ailing girl can have \"the full support of her family as she gets treatment to help save her life,\u201d said Danny Woodward of the Texas Civil Rights Project, a legal advocacy organization representing the family.",
      "The mother said her daughter's headaches and dizziness have worsened. The symptoms have become so recurrent that the girl\u2019s parents spend sleepless nights taking turns monitoring and caring for her.",
      "\u201cShe is very scared,\u201d mother said. \"We want to be there for her, we want to take care of her 100% like we've been doing so far. We don't want to be separated from her for even a minute.\"",
      "When the girl was in the U.S., under the care of doctors in Houston \"who saved her life,\" the parents were instructed to rush her to the hospital for an emergency check-up whenever she felt these symptoms, the mother said.",
      "\"But out here, that is impossible,\" she said in Spanish from Mexico, where her family was deported to Monterrey, an area known for the kidnapping of U.S. citizens. \u201cWhere am I going to go?\"",
      "NBC News is not publishing the family members\u2019 names out of concerns for their safety.",
      "Medical records show the child underwent surgery last year to remove a brain tumor caused by an \u201cunnamed \u2018novel\u2019 condition,\u201d according to Woodward. This means that few medical specialists can effectively treat and monitor her.",
      "The mother said the girl's doctors in the U.S. were not just treating her daughter's illness; they were \"also studying it because they don\u2019t know what caused it, why it was so aggressive.\" Even from Mexico, she has been in touch with the girl\u2019s doctors in the U.S., but they can\u2019t really assess what's happening to her from afar.",
      "The surgery that saved her life last year did leave the girl with some lasting side effects. The swelling on her brain is still not fully gone, causing difficulties with speech and mobility of the right side of her body as well as memory problems. These require the girl to routinely checking in with doctors monitoring her recovery, get MRI scans every three months, attend rehabilitation therapy sessions and take medication to prevent seizures.",
      "But she has not been able to consistently access this care since the family was deported, her mother and attorney said.",
      "The mother insists that the rod fixator preventing her daughter's right foot from turning inward needs to be replaced, as the girl trips more than usual.",
      "Her seizure medication is being sent to her from the United States because the family can't find the exact one she needs in Mexico, Woodward said. MRIs have also \"turned out to be very expensive and challenging for the family to get in Mexico.\u201d",
      "The girl has only been able to get one medical checkup and MRI in Monterrey. The experience made the mother realize how difficult it would be to get a new doctor in Mexico who can get up to speed with her daughter's medical history and treat her illness.",
      "\u201cNot any doctor wants to take on such a huge commitment,\u201d the mother said. \"It's like starting from scratch, or worse.\"",
      "Additionally, \u201cthe stress of the whole situation has definitely played a negative role\u201d in the girl\u2019s recovery, Woodward said. \u201cThis family has been severely traumatized.\"",
      "A family's 'truncated dreams'",
      "On Feb. 3, the family was driving from the Rio Grande Valley area, where they lived, to Houston, where the girl\u2019s doctors are based, for an emergency medical checkup.",
      "On the way, they stopped at a stateside immigration checkpoint, one they have passed through multiple times. But this time, immigration authorities arrested the parents after they were unable to show legal immigration documentation. Five of their children, ages 15, 13, 11, 8 and 6, were with them when they were arrested.",
      "Woodward said the parents have never done anything to make them a priority for removal. The entire family was taken to a detention facility, where they spent 24 hours before they were placed in a van and dropped on the Mexico side of a Texas bridge on Feb. 4.",
      "\"Another layer of this is the fact that the parents were never even given their due process rights, so they never were allowed to go in front of an immigration judge to plead their case,\" said Rochelle Garza, president of the Texas Civil Rights Project.",
      "A spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees USCIS, previously told NBC News that reports of the family\u2019s situation are \u201cinaccurate\u201d and declined to speak on the specifics of the case, citing privacy reasons. They said in a statement that when \u201csomeone is given expedited removal orders and chooses to disregard them, they will face the consequences.\u201d",
      "The eldest son, an 18-year-old U.S. citizen, was left behind in the U.S.",
      "\"The older boy woke up one morning and learned that his entire family was gone,\" Woodward said. He graduated high school alone, without his family.",
      "\u201cIt breaks our hearts,\u201d the mother said as she wept, adding that her son dreams of going to college and becoming a neurosurgeon after seeing how doctors saved his sister\u2019s life, but \u201che can\u2019t do that alone. He needs our support \u2014 even though we talk to him every day, it\u2019s really hard to be away.\"",
      "Instead of going to college, her son is working a fast-food job, hoping to soon see his family return home.",
      "While the Trump administration has aggressively stepped up the pace of deportations, including for immigrants who don\u2019t have criminal charges or convictions against them, there are three recent cases giving the girl's family hope.",
      "A Mexican mother living in California and her 4-year-old girl, who suffers from a life-threatening intestinal illness, were granted humanitarian parole this month following a public plea for deportation relief. In April, a Venezuelan immigrant in Chicago was released from immigration detention under humanitarian parole to serve as an organ donor for his ailing brother. In March, an undocumented mother in California caring for her 21-year-old daughter, a U.S. citizen undergoing treatment for bone cancer, was detained by immigration authorities and later released \"for humanitarian reasons.\"",
      "Even though the relatives in these cases were not deported, Woodward said, \"I don\u2019t think that should make any difference from the perspective of the federal government.\"",
      "\"It\u2019s a discretionary choice for them to make,\" he said. \"Our case, I think, it\u2019s a very strong one for humanitarian parole.\"",
      "The family's parole application includes letters of support from several members of Congress, including Democratic Reps. Adriano Espaillat of New York and Sylvia Garcia and Joaquin Castro of Texas, all of whom met with the family in Mexico last month.",
      "\"We want them to give us that chance,\" the mother said. \"We are not criminals. We are not delinquents. We simply want to save our daughter.\""

      "Despite price pressures from tariffs and an extended sales slump, Starbucks CEO Brian Niccol said he is optimistic the company is on the comeback trail.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m genuinely excited about the opportunity for our company,\u201d Niccol told NBC News\u2019 Hallie Jackson in an interview.",
      "Niccol is known as a turnaround expert, given his experience running Chipotle, which thrived under his watch. He\u2019s looking to replicate that success at Starbucks, the biggest coffee company in the world with 32,000 locations and $36 billion in annual revenue as of the last fiscal year.",
      "Competition from the likes of Dunkin', McDonald's and Dutch Bros. has taken a toll on Starbucks, as has consumers' weariness of stubborn inflation and rising prices. The company\u2019s same-store sales have fallen for five straight quarters, and it announced in April that its profit was cut in half compared to a year earlier.",
      "Since taking over in September, though, Niccol has rolled out changes to Starbucks\u2019 business model \u2014 cutting 30% of its menu, requiring that customers buy a menu item to sit in its stores and introducing a new \u201cgreen apron\u201d service model that uses an algorithm to help baristas sequence orders. Starbucks' stock is on the upswing since the company\u2019s lackluster earnings report in late April. Its growth this year has outpaced gains in the broad S&P 500 stock index.",
      "Niccol pinned the company\u2019s recent struggles on a lack of focus on customers\u2019 experience.",
      "\u201cWe veered away from, I think, owning the idea of the third place, the coffeehouse experience, making sure that the customer was front and center,\u201d Niccol said.",
      "Prices are a big part of his proposition to customers, as well.",
      "\u201cThat was our commitment. For this fiscal year we\u2019re not moving on prices. What I can\u2019t commit to is where the future goes,\u201d Niccol said. Starbucks\u2019 fiscal year concludes at the end of September.",
      "\u201cBut what I definitely can commit to,\u201d he added, \u201cis we\u2019re going to give people a great experience so that what you get for what they pay, they feel like they got a great value.\u201d",
      "Starbucks is introducing some targeted new products, including a new protein vanilla latte this week in select stores. There\u2019s also a chance, according to Niccol, that Starbucks may roll out trendy mushroom-infused coffees in future.",
      "Niccol acknowledged the company will continue to deal with external challenges \u2014 especially from Washington. President Donald Trump\u2019s uniform 10% tariff on all imports will likely raise the cost of Starbucks\u2019 raw coffee beans, which Niccol said \u201cfrankly cannot be grown in the United States.\u201d",
      "But Niccol is confident Starbucks can withstand any additional costs.",
      "\u201cThe thing that\u2019s great about Starbucks is we\u2019re a global company. We\u2019re an iconic brand,\u201d Niccol said. \u201cWe have the flexibility and scale to navigate wherever these policy changes go.\u201d"

      "INDIANAPOLIS \u2014 Early in the second quarter of Game 3 of the NBA Finals, the Indiana Pacers\u2019 home crowd was in a bit of a lull.",
      "After leading nearly the entire first quarter, the Oklahoma City Thunder began the second period with an eight-point advantage, a sobering continuation from Game 2, which the Thunder led for the last 38 minutes of play.",
      "Despite it being the first finals game in Indiana in 25 years, the energy in the arena was fading.",
      "But then T.J. McConnell went to work.",
      "In the first three and minutes and 52 seconds of the second, Indiana went on a 15-4 run, taking its first lead of the finals since the first quarter of Game 2.",
      "In that time, McConnell recorded four assists, three steals, two points and one offensive rebound \u2014 a scintillating stretch of play that brought a tense home crowd back to life.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s a guy that inspires a lot of people,\u201d Pacers coach Rick Carlisle said postgame. \u201cHe inspires our team a lot.\u201d",
      "\u201cHis energy is unbelievable,\u201d guard Tyrese Haliburton said. \u201cYou guys know he\u2019s definitely a crowd favorite. I joke with him, I call him the \u2018Great White Hope.\u2019 He does a great job of bringing energy in this building.\u201d",

      "McConnell\u2019s energy boost and clutch play played a critical role in Indiana\u2019s 116-107 win, which also gave the team a 2-1 lead in a series that few expect the Pacers to win. McConnell finished the game with 10 points, five assists and five steals, the first player in NBA history to post those numbers off the bench in a finals game. He was also a plus-12 in only 15 minutes.",
      "Three of McConnell\u2019s five steals came via what\u2019s become his signature play \u2014 lurking in the backcourt and taking advantage of unsuspecting and/or lazy inbounds passes for turnovers. Two of those steals led to points for Indiana, including a game-tying bucket in the fourth quarter, and all of them drew huge reactions from the crowd.",
      "McConnell, who is listed at 6\u20191\u201d, is the shortest player on either team in the finals. But despite taking up little space on the court, and playing the second-fewest bench minutes on the team, his impact was outsized.",
      "\u201cIn a series like this what\u2019s so important is the margins,\u201d Haliburton said. \u201cYou have to win in the margins. It\u2019s not necessarily who can make the most shots or anything. It\u2019s taking care of the ball, rebounding, little things like that. ... He [McConnell] did a great job of consistently getting there and making hustle play after hustle play, and sticking with it, and I thought we did a great job of just feeding off of what he was doing.\u201d",
      "The entire Indiana bench, in particular, seemed to feed off McConnell.",
      "The Pacers\u2019 backups made a massive difference in Game 3, outscoring the Thunder reserves 49-18. Pacers guard Bennedict Mathurin was the game\u2019s leading scorer, racking up 27 points in only 22 minutes.",
      "A 10-year veteran in his sixth season with Indiana, McConnell has always been the type of player to make the most of his opportunity. He hasn\u2019t started more than eight games in a season since 2017, and he\u2019s never averaged more than 26.3 minutes a night in his career.",
      "On Wednesday, though, he changed the course of the game, and perhaps even the series.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s been like a big brother to me since I\u2019ve gotten here,\u201d Haliburton said. \u201cYou look at T.J. McConnell and his story is unbelievable. So I just enjoy being able to play alongside him and the energy he gives his teammates in this building is \u2014 he\u2019s a lot of fun.\u201d"

      "NEW YORK \u2014 More than 460 laid-off employees at the nation\u2019s top public health agency received notices Wednesday that they are being reinstated, according to a union representing the workers.",
      "The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services confirmed reinstatement notices went out to the former Centers for Disease Control and Prevention employees, but provided few details.",
      "About 2,400 CDC employees lost their jobs in a wave of cuts across federal health agencies in early April, according to a tally at the time.",
      "Whole CDC programs were essentially shut down, including some focused on smoking, lead poisoning, gun violence, asthma and air quality, and workplace safety and health. The entire office that handles Freedom of Information Act requests was shuttered. Infectious disease programs took a hit, too, including programs that fight outbreaks in other countries, labs focused on HIV and hepatitis in the U.S., and staff trying to eliminate tuberculosis.",
      "An estimated 200 of the reinstated workers are based in the CDC\u2019s National Center for HIV, Viral Hepatitis, STD, and Tuberculosis Prevention, HHS officials confirmed. Staffers at a CDC lab that does testing for sexually transmitted diseases are being brought back, said one CDC employee who wasn\u2019t authorized to discuss what happened and spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity.",
      "Also reinstated are an estimated 150 employees at the CDC\u2019s National Center for Environmental Health, including people staffing a lab that works on lead poisoning, according to the union and employees.",
      "Layoffs at federal agencies were challenged in lawsuits, with judges in some cases ordering federal agencies to halt terminations of employees.",
      "Officials at HHS have never detailed how they made the layoff decisions in the first place. And they did not answer questions about why the notices went out, or how decisions were made about who to bring back.",
      "HHS spokesperson Andrew Nixon said the agency was streamlining operations and that \u201cthe nation\u2019s critical public health functions remain intact and effective.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe Trump Administration is committed to protecting essential services \u2014 whether it\u2019s supporting coal miners and firefighters through NIOSH, safeguarding public health through lead prevention, or researching and tracking the most prevalent communicable diseases,\u201d he said.",
      "The reinstatements don\u2019t undo the damage being done by Kennedy and the Trump administration to federal public health, said members of Fired But Fighting, a group of affected CDC workers who have helped organize rallies in Atlanta. The most recent was in the rain on Tuesday, at which some attendees called for Kennedy to resign.",
      "\u201cBringing a few hundred people back to work out of thousands fired is a start, but there are still countless programs at CDC that have been cut, which will lead to increased disease and death,\u201d one of the group\u2019s founding members, Abby Tighe, said in a statement.",
      "This is not the first time that employees at the Atlanta-based agency were told they were being terminated only to then be told to come back. After an earlier round of termination notices went out in February, about 180 CDC employees in March were told to come back."

      "McALESTER, Okla. \u2014 Oklahoma prepared to execute a man Thursday whose transfer to state custody was expedited by the Trump administration.",
      "John Fitzgerald Hanson, 61, is set to receive a lethal injection at the Oklahoma State Penitentiary in McAlester. Hanson was sentenced to die after he was convicted of carjacking, kidnapping and killing a Tulsa woman in 1999.",
      "Hanson, whose name in some federal court records is George John Hanson, had been serving a life sentence in federal prison in Louisiana for several unrelated federal convictions. Federal officials transferred him to Oklahoma custody in March to follow through on President Donald Trump\u2019s sweeping executive order to more actively support the death penalty.",
      "Hanson\u2019s attorneys argued in a last-minute appeal that he did not receive a fair clemency hearing last month, claiming that one of the board members who denied him clemency was biased because he worked for the Tulsa County District Attorney\u2019s Office when Hanson was prosecuted. A district court judge this week temporary halted the execution, but an appeals court later cleared the way for it.",
      "The U.S. Supreme Court late Wednesday rejected a separate appeal that alleged a key witness testified against Hanson in exchange for favorable treatment from prosecutors in a criminal case, information that was never disclosed to his defense team.",
      "Prosecutors allege Hanson and accomplice, Victor Miller, kidnapped Mary Bowles from a Tulsa shopping mall. Prosecutors allege the pair drove Bowles to a gravel pit near Owasso, where Miller shot and killed property owner Jerald Thurman. The two then drove Bowles a short distance away, where Hanson shot and killed Bowles, according to prosecutors. Miller received a no-parole life prison sentence for his role in the crimes.",
      "During last month\u2019s clemency hearing, Hanson expressed remorse for his involvement in the crimes and apologized to the victims\u2019 families.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not an evil person,\u201d Hanson said via a video link from the prison. \u201cI was caught in a situation I couldn\u2019t control. I can\u2019t change the past, but I would if I could.\u201d",
      "Hanson\u2019s attorneys acknowledged he participated in the kidnapping and carjacking, but said there was no definitive evidence that he shot and killed Bowles. They painted Hanson as a troubled youth with autism and who was controlled and manipulated by the domineering Miller."

      "A few minutes later, they got a burglary call from a business that was heavily damaged and saw the excavator slowly heading away, police said.",
      "Several cars immediately joined in the very slow speed pursuit. The excavator was going so slow that the cruisers would have to briefly stop several times a minute to not pass the construction equipment.",
      "They had their blue lights and sirens on and told the excavator driver over their loudspeakers that he was under arrest and needed to stop. Other cruisers blocked traffic.",
      "The chase went on for an hour and 12 minutes before the excavator drove on to the Charleston County Fairgrounds property, where it got stuck. The driver tried to run, but was followed by a drone until a police dog and handler caught up, authorities said.",
      "The 53-year-old driver of the excavator was charged with failure to stop for a blue light and two counts of malicious injury to real property and remained in the Charleston County jail on a $22,000 bond, according to jail records."

      "Gonzalez shared other interactions that led to their breakup. According to Gonzalez, Johnson felt she \u201cdisrespected him\u201d by wearing certain swimsuits, she said. He also would \u201cscold\u201d her in front of his family if she cursed.",
      "\u201cI just started feeling like I was losing my spark,\u201d she shared. \u201cIt was just things like that kept, like, making me feel small.\u201d",
      "Smith asked if their age gap, which was frequently mentioned during their time on \u201cLove Is Blind,\u201d played a role in the tension between them.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t believe it\u2019s the age gap. I don\u2019t think it was the numbers,\u201d Gonzalez replied. \u201cI think it was a matter of emotional availability and maturity, support and communication. Maybe the internet was right. Maybe he wasn\u2019t ready for marriage. I think he wanted to be ready for marriage, but I don\u2019t really think that he was ready to be a husband.\u201d",
      "Her recent health problems led to arguments, as well. Gonzalez shared that in September 2024 she was diagnosed with fibromyalgia. According to the National Institute of Health, fibromyalgia is a chronic disorder that causes pain throughout the body and also fatigue.",
      "\u201cIt kind of felt (like) relief. But at the same time, a life sentence,\u201d she explained. \u201cTo say that fibromyalgia has ruined my life doesn\u2019t even come near to it.\u201d",
      "She became emotional as she spoke about Johnson not being supportive after she was diagnosed. Gonzalez said she wanted to take a medical leave of absence from her job to focus on her health, but he disagreed.",
      "When Smith inquired about the current status of their relationship, Gonzalez described it as \u201cnonexistent\u201d since she filed for divorce on March 31.",
      "\u201cI never felt that my marriage was a priority for him,\u201d she said.",
      "She said she wanted to publicly address the split since social media users are invested in their relationship.",
      "\u201cI suffered so long in silence that my healing is going to be loud and profound,\u201d she added.",
      "In addition to the podcast, Gonzalez also penned a lengthy Instagram caption further explaining her decision to call it quits. The post included clips of sweet moments the couple shared together. It was her first social media post featuring Johnson since February.",
      "At the end of the caption, she wrote, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t change our marriage for anything, forever you have taken a piece of my heart with you, I loved you beyond the beyond, and for me Love will always be blind.\u201d",
      "Johnson has not commented about the divorce on social media. He also hasn\u2019t posted on Instagram since February 2024. His last post was a Valentine\u2019s Day tribute that featured pictures from a photoshoot with Gonzalez.",
      "The news of Johnson and Gonzalez\u2019s divorce comes a few weeks after Season 3 couple Colleen Reed and Matt Bolton shared they have broken up, too.",
      "Reed and Bolton, who were married for nearly four years, released a joint statement on Instagram May 23 about their split.",
      "\u201cHi everyone, we wanted to share something personal, and this is not easy to do, but after nearly four years together, we\u2019ve decided to end our marriage and move forward on our own paths,\u201d they said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been separated for some time now and have been doing our best to work through everything privately and with care.\u201d",
      "They continued, \u201cThis was an incredibly difficult decision, not one we made lightly. It came with a lot of thought and it\u2019s been an emotional process for both of us.\u201d",
      "Bolton and Reed said they were grateful for their relationship and wouldn\u2019t change anything. They ended their statement by thanking everyone who has supported their love story."

      "\u201cGinny & Georgia\u201d is a show about a mother and her two children. But in Season 3, a father steps into the spotlight.",
      "Zion Miller (played by Nathan Mitchell) rises to the fore of the show not only as Georgia\u2019s on-again, off-again love interest, but as a father reckoning with the emotional toll his absence has taken on his daughter, Ginny.",
      "In an interview with TODAY.com, Mitchell reflects on Zion\u2019s evolution and the weighty arcs shaping the Miller family dynamic this season.",
      "One of the most powerful moments comes in therapy, where Ginny opens up about how much Zion missed in her life.",
      "To recap, Zion and Georgia met as teenagers. When she became pregnant with Ginny, his parents stepped in to care for the infant. After they requested guardianship, though, Georgia ran away. She was gone for a year but returned, beginning Georgia\u2019s longest on-again, off-again romantic relationship.",
      "\u201cIt was really cathartic,\u201d Mitchell says of Zion and Ginny's conversation. \u201cZion is someone who\u2019s always followed his own path, but he cares deeply about Ginny. That scene shows him realizing the full impact of his absence.\u201d",
      "As Ginny continues to navigate trauma, secrecy and identity, Mitchell says Zion shares the blame.",
      "\u201cIf he could go back, he wouldn\u2019t have left,\u201d Mitchell reveals. \u201cHe finally sees what Georgia is capable of and realizes he needed to be the stable force all along.\u201d",
      "This season, Zion provides calm amid the chaos, stepping up for both Ginny and Georgia \u2014 even as Georgia faces legal trouble.",
      "\u201cGeorgia has this chaotic energy. Zion is the contrast,\u201d Mitchell says. \u201cHe\u2019s fiercer, more protective now. That\u2019s been exciting to play.\u201d",
      "The drama intensifies when Zion broaches the idea of joint custody. Mitchell hints at what\u2019s to come: \u201cI\u2019m hopeful that Georgia will be open to sharing custody of Ginny with Zion,\u201d he says. \u201cBut we\u2019re still in for some spicy drama.\u201d",
      "Zion\u2019s growing involvement as a father forces Georgia to confront a reality she\u2019s long resisted: that Ginny isn\u2019t hers alone.",
      "\u201cShe\u2019s always felt Ginny needed to be with her no matter what,\u201d Mitchell says. \u201cBut Zion\u2019s love and commitment are just as valid. The tension will come from whether Georgia can finally acknowledge that and make space for him.\u201d",
      "With Ginny making adult decisions, including an abortion, Zion\u2019s parenting style is more visible than ever: steady, open-hearted, and nonjudgmental.",
      "\u201cZion honors Ginny\u2019s autonomy,\u201d Mitchell says. \u201cSometimes you need to be firm, but more often, you need to be loving and present.\u201d",
      "Still, the road ahead isn\u2019t smooth. Ginny begins to mirror Georgia\u2019s manipulative traits, raising alarms for Zion.",
      "\u201cHe fears she might internalize the wrong lessons,\u201d Mitchell says. \u201cHe\u2019s encouraging her artistic side, her growth, but he\u2019s worried.\u201d",
      "Mitchell, though not a father himself, offers a message for parents: \u201cBe present. Be open. Vulnerability matters. Listen. You don\u2019t need all the answers \u2014 just care.\u201d",
      "Co-creators Sarah Lampert and Sarah Glinski echoed these themes. Glinski highlighted the therapy session between Ginny and Zion as a turning point.",
      "\u201cGinny always blames her mom, but the therapist asks, \u2018Where\u2019s your dad in all this?\u2019\u201d Glinski says. \u201cThat question shifts Ginny\u2019s perspective. She begins to hold Zion accountable too.\u201d",
      "Lampert says, \u201cThere\u2019s so much love, but also dysfunction. Zion stepping up now doesn\u2019t erase the past. But it does matter.\u201d",
      "Looking ahead, Season 4 teases even more drama between Zion and Georgia. But at its heart, both parents are learning to prioritize Ginny\u2019s future, however messy that road might be."

      "\"We are heartbroken to announce that our beloved father Brian Wilson has passed away,\u201d they wrote. \u201cWe are at a loss for words right now. Please respect our privacy at this time as our family is grieving. We realize that we are sharing our grief with the world. Love & Mercy.\u201d",
      "News of Wilson\u2019s death comes after his legal representatives said in 2024 that he had been suffering from a \u201cmajor neurocognitive disorder\u201d and suggested he be placed in a conservatorship.",
      "Wilson co-created The Beach Boys with his brothers Dennis and Carl Wilson, their cousin Mike Love and their friend Al Jardine in 1961, and would go on to become the band\u2019s primary songwriter.",
      "The Beach Boys scored an early hit with the harmony-drenched single \u201cSurfin,\u2019\u201d and went on to appear on the Billboard Top 40 single charts dozens more times with hits including \"Surfin' U.S.A.,\" \u201cI Get Around,\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t Worry Baby, \u201cCalifornia Girls\" and \"Good Vibrations.\"",
      "The band's genre-bending 1966 album \u201cPet Sounds,\u201d primarily written, arranged and produced by Brian Wilson, is often recognized as a pop masterpiece by music critics, mentioned in the same breath as The Beatles\u2019 1967 landmark album \u201cSgt. Pepper\u2019s Lonely Hearts Club Band.\u201d",
      "Wilson's composition style, inspired in equal parts by 1950s doo-wop and Bach, combined simple coming-of-age lyrics about teenage crushes with deftly original instrumentation and rich vocal harmonies.",
      "He and the other members of The Beach Boys were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1988 and the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2000.",
      "In his personal life, Wilson struggled with mental health issues and addiction, and had been diagnosed, at various times, with depression, schizoaffective disorder and paranoia, according to the Washington Post.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve lived a very, very difficult, haunted life,\u201d he told the publication in 2007.",
      "Wilson spent years in the round-the-clock care of celebrity psychologist Dr. Eugene Landy, who was later accused of trying to control the musician's life and was barred from contacting Wilson.",
      "The pair's unorthodox relationship was depicted in the 2015 film \u201cLove & Mercy.\u201d",
      "Wilson was a father of seven. He shared two daughters \u2014\u00a0Carnie Wilson and Wendy Wilson of the pop band Wilson Phillips \u2014\u00a0with his first wife Marilyn Wilson, and five other kids with his late wife Melinda Ledbetter, who died in January."

      "\u201cShe\u2019s been singing since she was a girl and in bands. She toured with Rufus, she\u2019s got an R&B rock band up in Malibu and she\u2019s just a wonderful person,\" he says.",

      "\u201cI would suggest that to couples: the ability not to push things down, not to over-explode, but to actually be with it. That\u2019s the deeper work as human beings. Can I be with what\u2019s come up personally? Can I then have an adult conversation with it where the emotion's not driving it?\" he says.",

      "It's been three years since the actor made a brief appearance on the CBS daytime drama to mark the show's 35th anniversary. Before that, Wagner played Nick from 2003-2012.",
      "So, what brings the character back this time around? Love, naturally.",
      "\"Nick is coming back because he heard that Brooke\u2019s (Katherine Kelly Lang) heart is broken and what\u2019s happened in this triangle with Ridge (Thorsten Kaye) and Taylor (Rebecca Budig),\" he tells TODAY.com during a video interview.",
      "For those not in the know, Brooke Logan's relationship with her longtime love, Ridge Forrester, has hit a rough patch in recent months.",
      "The on-again, off-again couple are currently on the outs after a series of unfortunate events, including a power struggle at Forrester Creations and the return of Ridge's ex-wife, Taylor Hayes.",
      "Despite Brooke's best efforts to win Ridge back and pry him away from Taylor, she has yet to succeed. And that's where Nick, another one of Brooke's former flames, comes in.",
      "\"He\u2019s decided that he\u2019s going to step in and try to wake Brooke up to this toxic pattern she\u2019s been in with Ridge for years and years,\" Wagner explains. \"That is his primary motivation. (It's like he's saying to Brooke), 'I am back to try to get you to wake up and realize that I\u2019m still in love with you, and I want you to step out of this insanity.'\"",
      "Brooke and Nick also have a complicated history. Over the years, Nick has been romantically linked to Brooke's two sisters and one of her daughters, in addition to Taylor. But Wagner says his character keeps coming back to Brooke since she was \"his initial love.\"",
      "In the years since viewers have last seen Nick, he\u2019s had a lot going on, and fans will get to learn a bit more about his backstory.",
      "\u201cI really felt he needed to upgrade from living on the Shady Marlin (his boat). Like he wasn\u2019t this scruffy, bearded, smoking sea captain anymore. This guy is now a shipping titan. He runs Marone Industries, an international shipping company,\" Wagner says.",
      "While preparing for his return to the show, Wagner advocated for an upgraded wardrobe that was fit for his character's advanced professional status. He also had a say in how his character would present himself when he reunited with Brooke.",
      "\u201cI told Brad (Bell, executive producer and head writer of the show), 'I think the key here is masculine. This has to be real masculine, confident energy from Nick,'\u201d he says.",
      "While shooting on location on Italy's Amalfi Coast and Capri, Wagner and Lang re-created a famous scene from their characters\u2019 past: the moment they first saw each other at Forrester Creations.",
      "\"We tried to re-create that as best we could with Kelly trying on some lingerie, and all of a sudden I'm kind of like, 'Who\u2019s there?'\" he recalls.",
      "Talking some sense into Brooke is Nick's main goal, but he will briefly interact with a few other characters, including Taylor and Ridge, his rival and half brother.",
      "\u201cWhen Ridge comes into the scenes, he\u2019s surprised. \u2018What are you doing here?\u2019 Nick is unmoved and doesn\u2019t have one ounce of fear when it comes to Eric Forrester (John McCook) or Ridge or anything that has to do with the powerful Forrester family. He is unmoved, confident and fearless,\" Wagner says.",
      "Viewers won't get to see Nick and Brooke's son, Jack, on screen, but they will get a quick update on how he's doing.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a reference because we didn\u2019t feel we had time to really explore that storyline. That could be (a) future (storyline). But for right now, we needed to just kind of focus on Nick trying to wake Brooke up out of this toxic pattern with Ridge and the Forresters,\" Wagner says.",
      "Returning to the show after all these years felt like \"jumping on a moving train\" for Wagner in the best possible way.",
      "\"Kelly and I love to work together, and we collaborate very nicely,\" he says of his co-star. \"And Brad (Bell) collaborates with the dialogue and things I want to do for the character.\"",
      "In recent years, Wagner has starred as Bill Avery on the Hallmark series \"When Calls the Heart,\" and he was able to squeeze in his \u201cB&B\u201d story arc just before he\u2019s set to return to Vancouver to film the latest season of the show.",
      "The actor has a packed schedule but is still leaving the door open to returning to \u201cB&B\u201d for some more action.",
      "\u201cWe talked about it, and (Bell) said, \u2018I really would love to maybe keep this character alive. How do you feel about it?\u2019\" Wagner says. \"So I just got the script for my final scenes with Brooke after the whole location shoot in Italy, and it looks really promising.\"",
      "Viewers will have to tune in to see exactly what happens, but Wagner is happy to give a little teaser, saying, \"It's really a big deal how he leaves it and Brooke's reaction to what Nick presents for her.\"",
      "Looking ahead, the actor says it \"might be possible\" to pull double duty on \u201cB&B\u201d and \u201cWhen Calls the Heart.\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019ll dust off my charming guy and my romantic guy on both shows. Who knows?\u201d he says.",

      "This past week, performer, \u201cRuPaul\u2019s Drag Race\u201d finalist and makeup mogul was spreading natto on lavash.",
      "\u201cBack on my bulls---,\u201d she said before taking a bite.",
      "The pairing of the Japanese fermented soybean dish with the Armenian flatbread shows her palate is as adventurous as her drag persona.",
      "This international culinary philosophy is documented in her debut cookbook, \u201cKim Chi Eats the World,\u201d which comes out on Oct. 21 from publisher Union Square & Co.",
      "The book features 75 recipes inspired by Kim Chi\u2019s life thus far \u2014 from her childhood in both South Korea and the U.S. to the countries she\u2019s visited during her drag career.",
      "Kim Chi has said on social media that the book was developed during the pandemic when she couldn\u2019t travel and wanted to re-create the dishes she\u2019s had all over the world in her own kitchen.",
      "It is separated into four main parts \u2014 one for each continent covered \u2014 and consists of foods from 21 countries: ketchup chips from Canada, lemon sole from France, roasted flour soup from Switzerland and pineapple cake bars from Taiwan.",
      "\u201cIt all stems from my experiences,\u201d Kim Chi tells TODAY.com. \u201cI\u2019ve always been curious about food from around the world and how other people eat.\u201d",
      "Get The Recipe",
      "The worlds of drag and home-cooking have been intertwined for decades. Back in 1996, Honey Van Campe published \u201cThe Drag Queen\u2019s Cookbook & Guide to Sensible Living.\u201d",
      "Over the years, queens like Ruby Ann Boxcar, Ginger Minj and Silky Nutmeg Ganache have dropped their own cookbooks. Trixie Mattel, a frequent Kim Chi collaborator, was nominated for a James Beard award in 2018 for making a peanut butter jelly sandwich and a cocktail.",
      "\u201cWith my book, the idea is introducing global cuisine to the American audience,\u201d Kim Chi says, adding that she\u2019s developed recipes that are easy to replicate using pantry staples. \u201cSo even if someone has never had a specific dish, they can easily just go to a grocery store, get all the ingredients they need and try out the recipe. I wanted to make the global flavors fun and accessible.\u201d",
      "Kim Chi \u2014 named after the Korean fermented vegetable dish \u2014 has a litany of food-based entries on her resume: She has partnered with Chipotle and Trejo\u2019s Donuts; she appeared on Hulu\u2019s \u201cDrag Me to Dinner\u201d with fellow \u201cDrag Race\u201d Season 8 finalist Naomi Smalls; she hosts the \u201c1 For The Table\u201d podcast with YouTuber and cook Jon Kung; and she\u2019s posted what she\u2019s eaten on the road from Singapore to Oregon on her food-focused Instagram account.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s funny how drag and food overlap,\u201d she writes in the introduction of her cookbook. \u201cBoth are about creativity, storytelling, and, most of all, a little drama. When it comes to blending eyeshadow or blending spices, I want everything to be just right. But what really ties drag and food together is the way they both unite people.\u201d",
      "Her love of food developed early. Born in Lansing, Michigan, she moved to South Korea when she was five and then back to the Midwest when she was 12.",
      "She describes the \u201cculture shock\u201d of the cafeteria at school \u2014 leaving behind the fresh variety of a Korean midday meal to eat a typical American lunch. This led her to the kitchen, fostering a lifelong interest in foods that don\u2019t come with a mini-carton of milk.",
      "\u201cAfter growing up in Korea and then moving to the States, being able to recreate the Korean dishes that my grandmother or my mom used to make in Korea was a good way to connect to my culture, especially where I grew up in small-town Michigan,\u201d Kim Chi says. \u201cThere really wasn\u2019t that much diversity.\u201d",
      "She says that in those formative adolescent years, her mom worked a lot, so she was in charge of cooking for her and her brother.",
      "\u201cAt home, I\u2019d just be creative, because ... we were poor,\u201d she says. \u201cI always worked with whatever ingredients we had in the kitchen and I would get really creative, and sometimes the recipes wouldn\u2019t work out, but when it did, it would be a hit.\u201d",
      "A childhood staple in the book that was also born out of the need to be creative is budae jjigae, aka \u201cArmy Base Stew,\u201d a hearty noodle stew that originated after the Korean War, as South Korean soldiers used U.S. military rations. Ingredients like Spam, kielbasa, baked beans and American cheese are simmered in a classic soup base of gochujang and kimchi.",
      "Get The Recipe",
      "She says she hopes some of her recipes help picky eaters branch out.",
      "Another recipe, Taiwanese ice cream wraps, features \u00ada crepe base, taro ice cream, grated candied peanuts and cilantro \u2014 a combination of flavors one might not expect in a dessert.",
      "\u201cI want the audience at home to experience the same shock I had when I tasted it,\u201d she says. \u201cI feel like life is too short to eat the same boring food over and over again, you know?\u201d",
      "\u201cEven if you don\u2019t like it, maybe this will make you more open-minded towards different types of food. It\u2019s a great way to learn about how people live, the climate and the types of ingredients that they have access to,\u201d she continues. \u201cAnd maybe it\u2019ll also make you more open-minded towards the world overall.\u201d"

      "\"I always used to say, 'I'm never getting married,'\" Cooper said in her new Hulu docuseries, \"Call Her Alex.\"",
      "\"I thought it would threaten my independence \u2014 no man should be able to say that I'm his. My view changed with Matt.\"",
      "Here's what to know.",
      "Who Is Matt Kaplan?",
      "Matt Kaplan, 41, is a Hollywood producer who's made his mark in the entertainment industry with hit projects like Netflix's \"To All the Boys I've Loved Before\" franchise and the spinoff \"XO Kitty.\"",
      "After working for CBS and Lionsgate Films, Kaplan founded Chapter One Films in 2013, per Deadline, and later established Ace Entertainment in 2017, where he serves as founder and CEO.",
      "Kaplan was previously married to actor Claire Holt from 2016 to 2017.",
      "Today, Kaplan and Cooper have co-founded media company Trending together.",
      "The love story that started on Zoom",
      "Cooper and Kaplan's love story began in July 2020, when Cooper had a long day full of online meetings with film and television companies.",
      "Her last meeting of the day was with Ace Productions, Kaplan's company. Cooper later dubbed him \"Mr. Sexy Zoom Man\" on her podcast.",
      "\u201cYou know those people you meet immediately that it\u2019s just like you feel like you\u2019ve known each other for so long?\u201d Cooper explained on an episode of \u201cCall Her Daddy.\u201d \u201cWe immediately vibed, and it was just like we\u2019re going to get along so well.\u201d",
      "Though the television show they discussed in that meeting didn't pan out, the couple decided to take a chance on each other. Cooper detailed her \u201cinternal battle\u201d of falling for Kaplan on her podcast, admitting she thought he was amazing but didn\u2019t know if she wanted to feel \u201ctied down or caged in.\u201d",
      "\u201cI think overall I\u2019m really enjoying his company,\u201d she shared with her listeners in August 2020. \u201cAre we making plans for the future? Yeah. Am I obsessed with him? I don\u2019t know!\u201d",
      "Looking back, Kaplan appreciates the quirky nickname that started it all.",
      "\u201cMr. Sexy Zoom Man. I think that name that she created was silly but honest of how we met,\u201d he says in Cooper\u2019s new docuseries. \u201cI think it allowed me to ease my way into the Call Her Daddy fandom, because I enjoy being a behind-the-scenes person.\u201d",
      "Their Riviera Maya wedding",
      "The couple got engaged at Cooper\u2019s West Hollywood home in May 2023 during what she thought was a W Magazine photoshoot but was actually an elaborate proposal setup.",
      "Almost a year later, in April 2024, the couple tied the knot in Riviera Maya, Mexico.",
      "Cooper made the bold choice to walk down the aisle by herself, she told Vogue.",
      "\u201cAt the beginning of wedding planning, I really rejected the concept of being walked down by a man to be handed to another man,\u201d she said. \u201cMy mom also walked herself down the aisle, so in a sense, I guess we are creating our own tradition for the women in our family.\u201d",
      "The couple's dogs, Henry and Bruce, served as ring bearers, while Cooper's brother Grant officiated the ceremony.",
      "Cooper's new two-part Hulu docuseries offers intimate glimpses into her wedding, including the couple's heartfelt vows.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re the best man I\u2019ve ever met. You inspire me every day. You\u2019re the most passionate about the people you love. Fiercely loyal, it\u2019s almost scary at times. And the way you love me, it\u2019s indescribable,\u201d Cooper said during the ceremony.",
      "Matt\u2019s vows focused on their smaller, intimate moments: \u201cIt\u2019s the conversations at 3 a.m. when we both can\u2019t sleep, shrouded in darkness of night, and thus able to speak more openly to one another. The whiskey in our yard on Friday nights after a long week. You mean the world to me. Thank you for coming into my life. I love you.\u201d",

      "She told W Magazine after their engagement why Kaplan was able to change her mind about marriage.",
      "\u201cWe had a really great dynamic early on that I didn\u2019t have in previous relationships, which is the amount that we communicate \u2014 even over communicate \u2014 about difficult things. Having that foundation of honesty and trust allowed us to get through things in life that made it so I couldn\u2019t envision anyone else by my side. On top of that, we have this insane chemistry.\u201d",

    "summary": "Mark Hamill talks about his role in \"The Life of Chuck\" and why the Stephen King movie might make you cry \"tears of joy.\"",
    "story": [
      "Mark Hamill's new film is probably going to make you cry, but that doesn't mean you shouldn't see it.",
      "\"It's tears of joy because it reaffirms your belief in mankind,\" Hamill explains in a sit-down interview with TODAY.com.",
      "The movie? \"The Life of Chuck.\" It's the latest project for the \"Star Wars\" actor, who plays Albie Krantz, the wise grandfather of Charles \"Chuck\" Krantz. Chuck is a man whose life is chronicled in reverse by four different actors: Cody Flanagan, Benjamin Pajak, Jacob Tremblay and Tom Hiddleston, who portrays Chuck as an adult.",
      "Based on Stephen King's 2020 novella of the same name, it's a serious departure from the writer's typical horror genre, although  Hamill says it's still got a few of King's signature trademarks, including supernatural and apocalyptic elements.",
      "\"It's certainly nothing like Stephen King has ever written before,\" says Hamill. \"He's done 'Green Mile' and 'The Body,' which became 'Stand By Me,' but even by those standards, this is unlike anything he's done.\"",
      "Also starring Chiwetel Ejiofor, Mia Sara and Karen Gillan, Hamill says \"The Life of Chuck\" is \"indescribable\" but so profound \u2013 and good \u2013 that he asked if he could \"go out on the talk shows\" to encourage viewers to \"please see it. Trust me, you'll thank me later.\"",
      "If audiences at the Toronto International Film Festival are any indication, he doesn't have to worry. After premiering at the festival, the film took home the People's Choice Award and has since garnered rave reviews by many critics, some of whom called the film one of the year's best.",
      "\"It's so positive. It's so optimistic about life,\" Hamill tells TODAY.com. \"It also teaches you there are moments that, in life, you think are trivial that collectively become very important.\"",
      "And if \"The Life of Chuck\" leaves people in tears, Hamill says it's because a movie \"this original\" only \"comes along once in a lifetime.\"",
      "\"I just loved it,\" he says. \"It's wonderful.\"",
      "'The Long Walk'",
      "\"The Life of Chuck\" isn't Hamill's only collaboration with King. The actor also appears in the upcoming film \"The Long Walk,\" a horror movie based on King's 1979 novel of the same name (published under the pseudonym Richard Bachman), starring Ben Wang, Cooper Hoffman, David Jonsson and Judy Greer, among others.",
      "\"The premise is just ghastly,\" he says of the film. \"It is more in the mold of what you associate Stephen King with.\"",
      "Less of a supernatural movie and more straight-up horror, \"The Long Walk\" takes place in a dystopian future and revolves around a group of young men who are chosen, a la \"The Hunger Games,\" to participate in a walk that only ends when everyone dies, except for a single, indomitable winner.",
      "\"The rules are simple: You walk until only one is alive,\" explains Hamill, saying that if walkers lag behind, fall to their knees or deviate from the walk in any way, it's \"a bullet to the head.\"",
      "Based on its grim premise, Hamill says his initial reaction to the role was, \"Not only can I not be in this, I don't think I can see it.\"",
      "But given that Francis Lawrence, the iconic director of \"The Hunger Games: Catching Fire\" and \"The Hunger Games: Mockingjay\" Parts 1 and 2, along with other notable films including the sci-fi classic \"I Am Legend,\" was at the helm of \"The Long Walk,\" Hamill says he reconsidered.",
      "\"I really admire him as a director,\" he explains, saying that after a call with Lawrence he changed his mind. \"By the end of the Zoom call, I said, 'Well, I've got to do it.' And my boys, of course, read it and said, 'Dad, this is great. You've got to do it.'\"",
      "Hamill plays a military major, or as he puts it, \"a badass guy,\" but says the true stars of the movie are the young actors he worked with, calling them the \"heart and soul\" of the movie.",
      "\"I was so impressed. These are all the young actors you're going to see in the future.\"",
      "'I Owe the World to Mike Flanagan'",
      "As for his own future, Hamill says he's loving \"every minute\" of his career right now and hopes to work on more projects with Mike Flanagan, the director and screenwriter of \"The Life of Chuck.\" Flanagan also created such notable series as \"The Haunting of Hill House,\" \"Midnight Mass\" and \"The Fall of the House of Usher,\" in which Hamill played Arthur Pym, a shadowy figure known as the \"Pym Reaper.\"",
      "\"It's the first time I've ever been asked to play something so far from myself on camera,\" he says of the role. \"Because I was playing a sociopathic, soulless, evil lawyer.\"",
      "Having done voice work for decades, Hamill says it's a role that would have been routine if he had done it as a voice-over, but he is grateful to Flanagan for giving him the opportunity to do such a \"juicy\" role in front of the camera.",
      "\"I owe the world to Mike Flanagan. That's why I'm so loyal to him. That's why I jumped at 'The Life of Chuck,'\" he says, continuing, \"He's just wonderful.\"",
      "As for what's next, Hamill says he's got yet another, undisclosed project in the works with Flanagan, but for the moment remains firmly focused on ensuring that audiences come out to see \"The Life of Chuck.\"",
      "\"You realize that human beings are inherently good,\" he says of the film's takeaway. \"And in this atmosphere of division and anger and uncertainty, it's exactly the right movie at exactly the right time.\""

      "She was ordered to keep her hands up and face toward a mirror, police said. At one point the shorter man threw her to the ground and put a boot on her ankle, then on the back of her neck and took her phone, she told police.",
      "The nanny started to scream and was pinned against a wall, with the shorter one holding her mouth shut, the police report said. She tried to kick the shorter one in the groin but was unable to see so she bit onto his hand hard, causing him to let go. The nanny then ran out of the home and knocked on numerous neighbors\u2019 doors before someone opened the door and let her call police, the report said.",

      "Israel has become more serious about a unilateral strike on Iran as the negotiations between the United States and Iran appear closer to a preliminary or framework agreement that includes provisions about uranium enrichment that Israel views as unacceptable.",
      "Details about the Israeli discussions emerged before the International Atomic Energy Agency's board of governors formally found that Iran isn\u2019t complying with its nuclear obligations for the first time in 20 years.",

      "Another possible factor: Iran is rebuilding its strategic air defenses, and manned strikes will soon be exponentially more dangerous for Israeli pilots. In October, Israel damaged nearly every one of Iran\u2019s strategic air defense systems (mainly S-300s), but much of the damage was to the radars or other parts that can be rebuilt. It\u2019s possible Israel\u2019s window for manned strikes, without being threatened by Iran\u2019s coordinated strategic air defenses, is closing.",
      "While Israel would most likely prefer U.S. military and intelligence support for strikes \u2014 especially against Iranian nuclear facilities \u2014 it showed in October that it can do a lot alone.",
      "Michael Knights of the Washington Institute for Near East Policy said the evacuation of nonessential staff members at the U.S. Embassy in Iraq will send a message to Tehran that Trump will not necessarily hold Israel back from launching a threatened attack on Iran.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s about trying to get Iran to respect the president\u2019s wishes,\u201d Knights said.",
      "Iran has failed to meet a two-month deadline Trump set to reach an agreement on the country\u2019s nuclear activities, and he is frustrated, he said.",

      "The U.S.- and Israeli-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation accused Hamas of killing at least five of its Palestinian employees on Wednesday, as almost 40 other Palestinians were killed near the foundation\u2019s aid sites in the Gaza Strip.",
      "The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), whose aid delivery has been mired in controversy and violence, said in a statement that more than two dozen of its employees were traveling by bus to a distribution center west of the southern city of Khan Younis when it was \u201cbrutally attacked by Hamas\u201d around 10 p.m. local time (3 p.m. ET), leaving at least five people dead and multiple others injured.",
      "The foundation said there was also \u201cfear that some of our team members may have been taken hostage.\u201d",
      "\u201cDespite this heinous attack, we will continue our mission to provide critical aid to the people of Gaza,\u201d it said.",
      "Hamas has not responded to the allegations and NBC News was unable to independently verify them.",
      "The GHF, which said it had been threatened by Hamas in recent days, began distributing aid in Gaza after Israel in mid-May eased its three-month total blockade on all supplies into the enclave, including food, medicine and other vital items, following an international outcry and warnings of famine from United Nations food experts.",
      "Despite the apparent loosening of the blockade, it is mostly the GHF that has been allowed to distribute aid \u2014 partly because it is supported by Israel and the U.S., which has raised doubts over its independence.",
      "GHF executive chairman Johnnie Moore has declined to reveal the organization\u2019s sources of funding.",
      "\u201cLike lots of private foundations, you know, it doesn\u2019t disclose its donors,\u201d he told NBC News in an exclusive interview.",
      "\u201cAnything that we do and anything that we say publicly is going to distract from the mission, and we have one mission, just one mission, which is to feed Gazans,\u201d said Moore, an evangelical Christian and former adviser to President Donald Trump who was appointed last week after his predecessor resigned citing \u201chumanitarian principles.\u201d",
      "Scrutiny of GHF has intensified in the past week as dozens of Palestinians were killed in and around its multiple aid sites in Gaza, which are in military zones and off-limits to independent media.",
      "Dr. Munir al-Barsh, director-general of the health ministry in Hamas-run Gaza, said 39 Palestinians had been shot and killed Wednesday as they sought aid from GHF.",
      "\u201cAid distribution sites have become death traps in the Gaza Strip,\u201d he said.",
      "As of Thursday, more than 200 Palestinians have been killed and about 1,500 have been injured in shootings near GHF sites, according to the health ministry, whose numbers are considered credible by the World Health Organization.",
      "While the GHF says there has been no violence in and around those distribution points, the Israeli military has previously acknowledged firing warning shots.",
      "On Wednesday, the U.N. said that even though people in Gaza were being killed and injured while trying to access food, Israel was still declining more than half of its requests to access critical supplies of fuel and to coordinate humanitarian movement inside the enclave.",
      "\u201cIf the population is inadequately supplied with the essentials for their survival, Israel must agree to humanitarian relief and facilitate it by all the means at its disposal,\u201d Farhan Haq, deputy spokesperson for the U.N. secretary-general, said at a news briefing.",
      "The U.N. agency in Gaza, UNRWA, also renewed its criticism of GHF on Wednesday, saying in a post on X that the aid distribution model was \u201cputting lives at risk.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt is also a distraction from the ongoing atrocities and a waste of resources,\u201d it said.",
      "The Israel-Hamas war began on Oct. 7, 2023, when Hamas carried out a terrorist attack on southern Israel in which at least 1,200 people were killed and 251 were taken hostage, according to an Israeli tally. Israel vowed to eliminate Hamas in response, launching a military campaign in Gaza that has so far killed more than 55,000 Palestinians, most of them women and children, according to Gaza\u2019s health ministry.",
      "The U.N. General Assembly is expected to vote Thursday on a resolution demanding an immediate ceasefire in Gaza, the release of all remaining hostages held by Hamas, and the opening of all Israeli border crossings to allow for the delivery of aid. A similar resolution failed last week in the U.N. Security Council, where it was supported by 14 of the 15 members but vetoed by the United States because it was not tied to the release of the hostages.",
      "The U.N. vote comes a day after Israeli forces said they had recovered the bodies of two of the hostages inside Gaza, naming one of them as Yair Yaakov and not releasing the name of the other.",
      "Hamas still holds 53 hostages, less than half of whom are believed to be alive.",
      "Tensions are also rising between Israel and Iran, where Israel is considering taking military action in the coming days, five people with knowledge of the situation told NBC News.",
      "Any strike would most likely be carried out without U.S. support as Trump is in advanced discussions with Tehran on a deal to curtail its nuclear program.",

The Israeli military did not comment on the strike, but said over the past day the air force has hit dozens of targets belonging to Hamas\u2019 military infrastructure, including rocket launchers.",

      "New Zealand\u2019s Foreign Minister Winston Peters said Wednesday that Smotrich and Ben-Gvir \u201chave severely and deliberately undermined\u201d prospects for peace and security while \u201cinciting violence and forced displacement.\u201d",
      "\u201cOur action today is not against the Israeli people, who suffered immeasurably on October 7 and who have continued to suffer through Hamas\u2019 ongoing refusal to release all hostages,\u201d Peters said in a statement. \u201cNor is it designed to sanction the wider Israeli government.\u201d",
      "Smotrich wrote on social media that he learned of the sanctions while he was inaugurating a new West Bank settlement. \u201cWe are determined to continue building,\u201d he said.",
      "Ben-Gvir, also writing on social media, said \u201cwe overcame Pharoah, we\u2019ll overcome Starmer\u2019s Wall,\u201d referring to British Prime Minister Keir Starmer.",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the U.S. condemned the sanctions and urged their reversal.",
      "\u201cWe reject any notion of equivalence: Hamas is a terrorist organization that committed unspeakable atrocities, continues to hold innocent civilians hostage, and prevents the people of Gaza from living in peace,\u201d he said in a post on X. \u201cWe remind our partners not to forget who the real enemy is.\u201d",
      "Israel\u2019s government also condemned the announcement, which came as traditional allies of Israel escalate denouncements of Israel\u2019s actions in Gaza, from the high civilian death toll to a monthslong blockade that led to famine warnings.",
      "Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar called the sanctions decision \u201coutrageous.\u201d He said he had discussed it with Netanyahu and that they would meet next week to discuss Israel\u2019s response.",
      "He said the move threatened to harden Hamas\u2019 stance in ongoing negotiations to end the war in Gaza and to cut short Israel\u2019s operation in Gaza before it achieves its goals.",
      "Benny Gantz, a centrist Israeli lawmaker and political rival to Netanyahu, wrote that he \u201cvehemently\u201d disagreed with Smotrich and Ben-Gvir, but said the move was a \u201cprofound moral mistake and sends a dangerous message to terrorists around the world.\u201d",
      "Netanyahu is the target of an arrest warrant issued by the International Criminal Court last year over alleged war crimes in Gaza, part of a global wave of outrage at Israel\u2019s conduct during its 20-month war against Hamas. Netanyahu has denied the allegations and accused the court of being biased against Israel.",
      "The Biden administration took the rare step of sanctioning radical Israeli settlers implicated in violence in the occupied West Bank \u2014 sanctions that were lifted by President Donald Trump.",
      "Eitay Mack, an Israeli human rights lawyer who spent years campaigning for the sanctions on Smotrich and Ben-Gvir \u2014 along with violent West Bank settlers \u2014 described Tuesday\u2019s move as \u201chistoric.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt means the wall of immunity that Israeli politicians had has been broken,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s unbelievable that it took so long for Western governments to sanction Israeli politicians, and the fact that it\u2019s being done while Trump is president is quite amazing.\u201d",
      "Mack added: \u201cIt is a message to Netanyahu himself that he could be next.\u201d",
      "Israel captured the West Bank, along with east Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip, in the 1967 Mideast war. The Palestinians want all three territories for a future state.",
      "Successive Israeli governments have promoted settlement growth and construction stretching back decades. It has exploded under Netanyahu\u2019s far-right coalition, which has settlers in key Cabinet posts.",
      "There are now well over 100 settlements across the West Bank that house more than 500,000 settlers. The settlers have Israeli citizenship, while the territory\u2019s 3 million Palestinians live under Israeli military rule, with the Palestinian Authority administering population centers.",
      "Most of the international community considers the settlements illegal, and Palestinians see them as the greatest obstacle to an eventual two-state solution, which is still seen internationally as the only way to resolve the conflict."

    "story": [
      "As U.S. and Chinese negotiators meet for trade talks in London this week, a primary concern for Washington will be whether Beijing eases the flow of rare earth materials, which have become key components of modern life.",
      "China dominates the global supply chain for rare earths, mining about 70% and refining 90% of the materials used to produce everything from wind turbines and defense equipment to electric vehicles and car seats. The United States produces virtually none of the world\u2019s rare earths, whose extraction can be devastating for the environment.",
      "That economic vulnerability has come into sharper focus since April, when China imposed export controls on seven strategic rare earth metals and related magnets amid an escalating trade war with President Donald Trump. Companies, especially automakers and business associations in the U.S., Europe and elsewhere have sounded the alarm, warning that China\u2019s rare earth restrictions risk delays that could bring manufacturing to a halt.",
      "Kevin Hassett, director of the National Economic Council, told CNBC on Monday that U.S. negotiators in London were seeking a \u201chandshake\u201d from China on rare earths after Trump said last week that Chinese President Xi Jinping had agreed to resume their flow in the first call between the two leaders since Trump returned to office.",
      "\u201cThey were kind of releasing them, but it was going a lot slower than some companies believed was optimal,\u201d Hassett said.",
      "In an editorial Monday, the Chinese state-run news agency Xinhua said the rare earth export controls were not a \u201cshort-term bargaining chip\u201d for trade talks but a responsible policy aimed at preventing rare earths, which have both civilian and military uses, \u201cfrom being used in activities that threaten international peace and security.\u201d",
      "\u201cImposing export controls on strategic resources with clear dual-use characteristics is a common international practice and a legitimate right of sovereign nations to safeguard their own security,\u201d the editorial said.",
      "Signs of hope have appeared in recent days. On Saturday, the Chinese Commerce Ministry said it was open to talks on rare earth export controls, and that it \u201cfully considers the legitimate needs and concerns of other countries.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "A Burmese American woman was eager to bring her siblings over to the U.S. from Myanmar amid a more than 15-year wait for visas. She\u2019d been hoping to reunite with them since the 1990s, during military rule in her home country, so her brother\u2019s family could start a life in the U.S. But a day after she bought the plane tickets, President Donald Trump ordered a travel ban that included Myanmar.",
      "The woman, 51, and her husband, who were granted anonymity due to fear of retaliation, had sponsored her brother and sister-in-law to immigrate to the U.S. The siblings were then were hoping to bring their own adult kids, too, so that they wouldn\u2019t have to fulfill mandatory military service in the country\u2019s active civil war.",
      "With the travel ban in effect Monday, they said the policy has a heightened impact on people from war-torn countries like Myanmar who had hopes of finding sanctuary in the U.S.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s really frustrating because we were on the cusp of securing their safety to leave that situation,\u201d said her husband, 57, adding he felt like a \u201crug got pulled out from under us in an instant.\u201d",
      "White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson said Trump\u2019s policy is in the \u201cbest interest of the American people and their safety.\u201d",
      "\u201cHis commonsense, country-specific travel restrictions include places that lack proper vetting, exhibit high visa overstay rates, or fail to share identity and threat information,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cThe restrictions fulfill the President\u2019s day one promise to protect American citizens from dangerous foreign actors who may come to the United States and cause us harm.\u201d",
      "The travel restrictions, announced on Wednesday, completely bar entry to the U.S. for people from Myanmar, formerly known as Burma, in addition to those from Afghanistan, the Republic of Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen. Other countries, including Cuba, Laos and Venezuela, are under partial travel restrictions.",
      "According to Trump\u2019s proclamation, several of the countries on the list had declined to accept the repatriation of their nationals while others had visa overstay rates that the administration deemed \u201cunacceptable.\u201d A few countries lacked \u201cthe competence of the central authority\u201d for issuing passports, the proclamation said.",
      "Jackson also pointed out a section in the proclamation that allows for applications for refugee status.",
      "\u201cNothing in this proclamation shall be construed to limit the ability of an individual to seek asylum, refugee status, withholding of removal, or protection under the [international Convention Against Torture], consistent with the laws of the United States,\u201d the proclamation said.",
      "However, after he took office, Trump limited refugee admissions for almost all countries including Myanmar. And in May, the Supreme Court allowed the Trump administration to revoke the temporary legal status of more than 500,000 immigrants that was granted by the Biden administration. Those immigrants came from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela and are now subject to deportation.",
      "Myanmar was among the nine countries in the latest proclamation that Trump also targeted during his first term. In fiscal year 2023, the U.S. issued 13,284 visas to the country, with business and tourism permits making up the most common types of visas. Myanmar recorded 1,384 overstays that fiscal year, equating to an overstay rate of almost 30%.",
      "The new travel ban comes as Myanmar\u2019s violent military regime fights to hold on to power after it seized control from the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi in a 2021 coup. Since then, violence has escalated across the region as the military clashes with ethnic minority rebel groups and pro-democracy militias.",
      "\u201cJunta forces have slaughtered thousands of civilians, bombed and burned villages, and displaced millions of people,\u201d Tom Andrews, United Nations special rapporteur on the human rights situation in Myanmar, said in a press release earlier this year. \u201cMore than 20,000 political prisoners remain behind bars. The economy and public services have collapsed. Famine and starvation loom over large parts of the population.\u201d",
      "Under the new travel ban, anyone who obtained a visa prior to the policy is still able to come to the U.S. But there\u2019s confusion over how the restrictions will be implemented and enforced. The Burmese American woman and her husband are among those with concerns, particularly as there have been several cases of lawful permanent residents and citizens being swept up in the dragnet of Trump\u2019s immigration policies.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s terrifying to think that they could be randomly picked up because somebody had a bad day at the office, or somebody didn\u2019t do their job or didn\u2019t believe that their visa was true,\u201d the woman's husband said. \u201cIt\u2019s quite frankly terrifying.\u201d",
      "For the woman, reunification with her brother has been a long time coming. She became a citizen in the late 1990s and began the process to help bring her sibling over a few years later. At the time, Myanmar had been under the control of a strict military junta that held power from the 1960s until 2011, and for decades had kept the country in a state of extreme isolation and deprivation. She said her brother, whose children were just a few years old then, hoped to come over and root his family in more stability.",
      "\u201cTheir circumstances in Myanmar at that time were very, very bad. That was the system that I grew up in. There was no future for them, no prosperity,\u201d the woman said. \u201cMy brother was concerned for his children\u2019s future and education.\u201d",
      "Amid moves and address changes, the couple said they never received the standard letter notifying them that the woman's brother had been able to progress in his visa process. They assumed the wait was a product of notorious immigration backlogs. It wasn\u2019t until the situation in Myanmar intensified again in recent years that the couple found out that the brother was close to finally being able to immigrate. But by then, the woman said, her brother\u2019s kids had aged out of the system.",
      "According to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, those who turn 21 before being approved for legal permanent resident status are no longer considered a child for immigration purposes and need to file an entirely new application, prolonging the green card process.",
      "At this point, the woman said, her brother and sister-in-law said they were willing to risk possible detention to come to the U.S., particularly if it meant easier access to the American immigration system that would enable them to fight to get their children to come over as well. However, with Myanmar\u2019s military draft in effect, the family is particularly concerned for their safety now that the travel ban adds another barrier to leaving.",
      "\u201cThe reason they wanted to come here was for their kids,\u201d the woman said of her brother and sister-in-law. \u201cNow, it\u2019s really hard to bring my nephews here to save their lives.\u201d",
      "Quyen Dinh, executive director of the Southeast Asia Resource Action Center, said the bans are ultimately another part of \u201cthe engine of Trump\u2019s mass deportation machine.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s focused on demonizing immigrant families and communities by denying them family reunification, that we all rightfully deserve to be whole \u2014 especially now, when the world is more dangerous than ever,\u201d Dinh said.",
      "Rather than protecting individuals\u2019 safety, Dinh said, she believes Trump\u2019s policy punishes those who need an escape from dangerous conditions.",
      "\u201cIt perpetuates the violence that is happening across the world, as opposed to creating conditions for peace or humanitarian relief, and for these families who\u2019ve been separated,\u201d Dinh said.",
      "She also said she views the ban as evidence that the U.S. is misunderstanding its role as a humanitarian leader.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve got people who are legitimately trying to escape a civil war,\u201d the woman's husband said. \u201cNow, because of some arbitrary decision by the Trump administration to pick a certain number of countries \u2026 without consideration of the actual cases, without an exception policy, it hurts them. They\u2019ve done nothing wrong.\u201d"

      "The ban, which goes into effect Monday, has led to widespread uncertainty for many and drawn condemnation from international leaders. The proclamation issued Tuesday offered exceptions for those who are lawful permanent U.S. residents and those traveling to the U.S. for the World Cup and the Olympics, among other examples. No such mention was made for cases of medical necessity, such as those who are seeking treatment in the U.S. through the International Cardiac Alliance.",
      "The International Cardiac Alliance\u2019s total waitlist for Haitians, ranging from infants to young adults, totals at least 316 people who need heart surgery, said Executive Director Owen Robinson. Some are placed in hospitals in the Dominican Republic and occasionally the Cayman Islands. But there are currently five open surgical slots in the U.S.",
      "\u201cSome of them might be able to wait a few months, and others, if they don\u2019t go now, they\u2019re going to pass away very quickly,\u201d Robinson said.",
      "The president\u2019s executive order adds that the secretary of state can issue exemptions for visas in cases that \u201cserve a United States national interest.\u201d It is unclear if clients of the International Cardiac Alliance with medical needs would fit into that description. Neither the White House nor the State Department responded to a request for comment on the matter.",
      "\u201cWe do have kids die every week waiting because there\u2019s not a lot of international slots for these kids,\u201d Robinson said.",
      "Some of the children in the program travel directly from their home country to the U.S., undergo surgery, and then return to Haiti. But for many Haitians, international travel requires multiple levels of logistical wrangling, Robinson said. Some patients and their parents who can secure surgeries in other countries must apply for a visa to the U.S., travel here, and then head to their eventual destination. The United States\u2019 travel ban now throws a wrench in that process.",
      "Fabienne Rene, 16, was diagnosed with rheumatic heart disease in February. Because of her condition, Fabienne, who lives in Port-au-Prince, cannot even attend school since she experiences shortness of breath, said her father, Fignole Rene. The \u201cbad news\u201d he received about the travel ban causing the postponement or potential cancellation of his daughter\u2019s travel through the U.S. to the Dominican Republic is \u201creally disturbing and breaking my heart,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cI was not waiting to hear something like that,\u201d Rene, 53, said in Creole through a translator. \u201cWe know for sure that there is nowhere in Haiti we can have this possibility. The only option that we have was just waiting to have an open door from the Cardiac Alliance.\u201d",
      "He also said the news will be troubling for his family to hear and that they don\u2019t know \u201cwhere they will find another open door that can give her a chance.\u201d",
      "Robinson said the U.S. Embassy in Haiti recently informed him that it most likely wouldn\u2019t be able to issue any visas due to the travel ban. In the past, the embassy has repeatedly issued visas for Haitian children to travel to the U.S. for care. The office of Rep. Becca Balint, D-Vt., has offered to reach out to the State Department to see if the children can receive exceptions, he added.",
      "Dr. John Clark, a pediatric cardiologist at Akron Children\u2019s Hospital in Ohio who has worked with the ICA, said many children in impoverished countries like Haiti suffer from Fabienne\u2019s condition because they are not seen by a doctor and treated for the common illness strep throat. Untreated, recurring strep infections can lead to rheumatic heart disease.",
      "St. Damien Pediatric Hospital in Port-au-Prince received visiting pediatric surgical teams from 2015 to 2019, Robinson said. Now, dangerous conditions in Haiti prevent doctors from other countries from entering or providing care. Meanwhile, Haiti does not have enough doctors practicing there, and the loss of opportunities for a medical education in Haiti only perpetuates the problem, Clark said.",
      "Clark participated in a surgical mission there in 2019, when visiting U.S. doctors were performing two heart surgeries per day, he said. A drastic rise in gang violence \u2014 including an attack on one of the hospital\u2019s ambulances and a worker being stoned to death \u2014 ended most medical missions to Haiti.",
      "Gang violence has only escalated since then, United Nations figures show, particularly after the assassination of Haiti\u2019s President Jovenel Mo\u00efse in 2021. Haiti is one of the poorest countries in the world, and more than half of Haitians live below the poverty line. The country is also plagued with government corruption, gang violence and food insecurity, as well as vulnerability to natural disasters, including a devastating 2010 earthquake that killed at least 220,000 people. Lack of adequate health care also fuels diseases like cholera, according to the Council on Foreign Relations.",
      "\u201cI hope things can calm down one day enough that we can get back there [to Haiti],\u201d Clark said. \u201cBut right now, there\u2019s no way for us to go back down.\u201d",

      "On Thursday, Andrice\u2019s father, Andre Boncoeur, said he had not yet told his son about the travel ban preventing him from passing through the U.S. Boncoeur said he knows \u201csomething can change at any time.\u201d",
      "Still, children like Andrice do not have much time to wait. In April, Andrice was once again hospitalized for three days at Haiti\u2019s Centre Hospitalier Eben-Ezer for heart failure.

      "Some residents of Ballymena, about 25 miles northwest of Belfast with a population of 30,000, responded to the anti-foreigner vigilantism by sticking the Union Jack or signs in their windows reading \u201cBritish household\u201d and \u201clocals live here,\u201d in an apparent attempt to be spared by the rioters.",
      "NBC News\u2019 British partner Sky News has seen residents from ethnic minorities packing up suitcases and leaving their homes, while others have spoken of their terror that the mob violence will continue.",
      "The violence first flared Monday during a vigil for a teenage girl who was the victim of an alleged sexual assault two days before. Two teenage boys, both 14, were charged with  attempted rape and appeared in court Monday, communicating through a Romanian translator. The boys' identities have not been released because of their age.",
      "Masked rioters broke away from the otherwise peaceful vigil, building barricades and throwing bricks, Molotov cocktails and fireworks at houses and police.",
      "Riot police responded with rubber bullets and a water cannon. More than 40 officers have been injured over the three nights, the Police Service of Northern Ireland, known as the PSNI, said.",
      "The violence also spread to other towns in Northern Ireland, such as Coleraine, where a bus station was attacked, access to the train station was blocked and rioters pushed trash cans onto the rails and set them alight Wednesday night, police said.",
      "In Larne, some people whose homes were destroyed were given shelter at a leisure center \u2014 until that was targeted and set on fire, too.",
      "In total, 10 people, all men in their teens, 20s and 30s, have been arrested. Three of them, aged 18, 17 and 15, have been charged and are set to appear in court Thursday.",
      "\u201cThis violence was clearly racially motivated and targeted at our minority ethnic community and police,\u201d Ryan Henderson, PSNI assistant chief constable, said Tuesday at a news conference. \u201cIt was racist thuggery pure and simple and any attempt to justify and explain it as something else is misplaced.\u201d",
      "A Bulgarian national who lives in Ballymena and asked that her identity be protected told Sky News,\u201cIt\u2019s terrifying, honestly, I\u2019m scared to get out of the house,\u201d",

      "SYDNEY \u2014 Australia\u2019s defense minister said Thursday he was confident that the AUKUS submarine pact with the United States and Britain would proceed, and that his government would work closely with the U.S. while the Trump administration conducted a formal review.",
      "Australia in 2023 committed to spend 368 billion Australian dollars ($239 billion) over three decades on AUKUS, the country\u2019s biggest ever defense project with the U.S. and Britain, to acquire and build nuclear-powered submarines.",
      "A Pentagon official said the administration was reviewing AUKUS to ensure it was \u201caligned with the President\u2019s America First agenda\u201d on the eve of expected talks between President Donald Trump and Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese.",
      "In an Australian Broadcasting Corporation radio interview, Australian Defense Minister Richard Marles said AUKUS was in the strategic interests of all three countries and that the new review of the deal signed in 2021 when Joe Biden was the U.S. president was not a surprise.",
      "\u201cI am very confident this is going to happen,\u201d he said of AUKUS, which would give Australia nuclear-powered submarines.",
      "\u201cThis is a multi-decade plan. There will be governments that come and go and I think whenever we see a new government, a review of this kind is going to be something which will be undertaken,\u201d Marles told the ABC.",
      "Albanese is expected to meet Trump for the first time next week on the sidelines of the Group of 7 meeting in Canada, where the security allies will discuss a request from Washington for Australia to increase defense spending from 2% to 3.5% of gross domestic product.",
      "Albanese has said defense spending would rise to 2.3% and has declined to commit to the U.S. target.",
      "The opposition Liberal party on Thursday pressed Albanese to increase defense spending.",
      "Under AUKUS, Australia was scheduled to make a $2 billion payment in 2025 to the U.S. to help boost its submarine shipyards and speed up lagging production rates of Virginia-class submarines to allow the sale of up to three U.S. submarines to Australia starting in 2032.",
      "The first $500 million payment was made when Marles met with his U.S. counterpart, Pete Hegseth, in February.",
      "The Pentagon\u2019s top policy adviser Elbridge Colby, who has previously expressed concern that the U.S. would lose submarines to Australia at a critical time for military deterrence against China, will be a key figure in the review, examining the production rate of Virginia-class submarines, Marles said.",
      "\u201cIt is important that those production and sustainment rates are improved,\u201d he added.",
      "AUKUS would grow the U.S. and Australian defense industries and generate thousands of manufacturing jobs, Marles said in a statement.",
      "John Lee, an Australian Indo-Pacific expert at Washington\u2019s conservative Hudson Institute think tank, said the Pentagon review was \u201cprimarily an audit of American capability\u201d and whether it can afford to sell up to five nuclear-powered submarines when it is not meeting its own production targets.",
      "\u201cRelatedly, the low Australian defense spending and ambiguity as to how it might contribute to a Taiwan contingency is also a factor,\u201d Lee said.",
      "John Hamre, president of the Center for Strategic and International Studies and a former senior Pentagon official, told a Lowy Institute seminar in Sydney on Thursday there is a perception in Washington that \u201cthe Albanese government has been supportive of AUKUS but not really leaning in on AUKUS,\u201d and that defense spending is part of this.",
      "Under the multi-stage pact, four U.S.-commanded Virginia submarines will be hosted at a Western Australian navy base on the Indian Ocean starting in 2027, which a senior U.S. Navy commander told Congress in April gives the U.S. a \u201cstraight shot to the South China Sea.\u201d",
      "Albanese wants to buy three Virginia submarines starting in 2032 to bring its submarine force under Australian command.",
      "Britain and Australia will jointly build a new AUKUS-class submarine that is expected to come into service starting in 2040. Following a recent defense review, Britain said it would boost spending on its attack submarine fleet under AUKUS.",
      "Former Prime Minister Scott Morrison, who struck the AUKUS deal with Biden, said Thursday that Australia should \u201cmake the case again\u201d for the treaty.",
      "AUKUS would build more submarines across the three partners and was \u201cfundamentally about strengthening collective deterrence, particularly in the Indo-Pacific against potential adversaries,\u201d he wrote on LinkedIn."

      "Views of the U.S. and confidence in its leader to handle world affairs have taken a dive in more than a dozen countries over the last year, according to a poll from the Pew Research Center released Wednesday and conducted over the first few months of President Donald Trump's second term.",
      "These declines are most pronounced among residents in neighboring Mexico and Canada, which have been at the center of high-profile spats with the administration, as well as a handful of NATO countries (like Sweden, Poland and the Netherlands) amid Russia's war with Ukraine.",
      "Public sentiment about the U.S. has gone up in a few countries over the last year, most notably in Israel. But most of the two-dozen countries surveyed saw public opinion about the U.S. dip as Trump began his second term.",
      "Overall, the poll shows an international community full of increased skepticism of Trump and his \"America First\" foreign policies, from his administration's antagonistic relationship with traditional close allies to its focus on tariffs to its friendly posture toward right-wing, populist movements that have been amassing more power in Europe.",
      "Yet while the results in many countries are negative, Trump's marks are broadly higher this year in these nations than they were during the beginning of his first term eight years ago.",
      "Fifteen countries have seen significant drops in their opinion of America over the last year. In Mexico, 61% of respondents had a favorable opinion of the U.S. in 2024, but just 29% feel that way this year.",
      "In Sweden, which joined NATO in 2024 following the Russian invasion of Ukraine two years prior, a 47% favorable rating of the U.S. last year plummeted to just 19% this year, with 79% of Swedish respondents viewing America unfavorably.",
      "And in Canada, a 54% favorability mark in 2024 dropped 20 points in 2025, to 34%, amid Trump's repeated threats to make the country America's newest state.",
      "On the other end of the spectrum, the share of people in Turkey, Nigeria and Israel who rated the U.S. favorably increased significantly over the last year.",
      "Pew polled 28,333 adults across 24 countries mostly over the phone or in person (Australia was the only country where people were polled online). The survey was in the field for various times across different countries from Jan. 8 to April 26. Polling in every country except Indonesia began after Trump\u2019s inauguration, but it was either concluded or close to done by Trump\u2019s April 2 announcement of sweeping international tariffs.",
      "When it comes to Trump specifically, a majority of respondents in five countries of the 24 surveyed said they have a lot or some confidence in the president to do the right thing when it comes to world affairs: Hungary, India, Israel, Nigeria and Kenya. Majorities in nine of the 10 European countries tested have either not too much or no confidence in Trump at all, with at least three-quarters of respondents saying so in the Netherlands, France, Spain, Germany and Sweden.",

While 63% in both Sweden and Germany had confidence in then-President Joe Biden last year, just 15% and 18%, respectively, said they have confidence in Trump.",
      "The survey also tested how well respondents felt several different personal characteristics described Trump. At least 60% of adults across 21 of the 24 countries surveyed said the word \"arrogant\" described Trump well.",
      "Majorities in 20 countries said he's \"a strong leader,\" while majorities in 21 countries called him \"dangerous.\"",
      "Majorities in three countries (Nigeria, India and Kenya) said Trump was \"honest,\" and majorities in five countries (Greece, Japan, Indonesia, Hungary and Kenya) called him \"diplomatic.\"",
      "Compared with his first term, the share of people across most of the surveyed countries who see Trump as a strong leader and qualified has increased. There has also been a dramatic increase in the share of adults who believe America's president is \"dangerous\" in countries where Pew also tested Biden\u2019s first year in office.",
      "On confidence in Trump to tackle global economic problems, Trump is underwater in every European country surveyed, though Hungarians are effectively split. The survey was mostly conducted before Trump announced global tariffs on April 2.",
      "In Mexico, where the survey was conducted following weeks of changing tariff policies on the country, 83% lack confidence in Trump\u2019s economic policies. In Canada, which has faced similar targeting from Trump, 74% lack confidence, and 57% said they have no confidence at all.",
      "Majorities in three countries \u2014 Kenya (56%) and Nigeria and Israel (62% each) \u2014 have confidence in Trump to handle \"the conflict between Israel and its neighbors.\" His numbers among the countries tested are the lowest in Turkey, where 7% are confident in his handling of the issue.",
      "Though a majority of Israelis expressed confidence in Trump\u2019s ability to handle the ongoing war, the poll found that confidence in Trump among right-wing Israelis is nearly four times higher, at 83%, compared with the 21% of left-wing Israelis who have confidence in Trump on the issue. Adults in most other countries said they were not confident in Trump's ability to handle the conflict.",
      "On Trump\u2019s handling of the Russia-Ukraine war, majorities in nearly all of the European countries surveyed, with the exception of Greece and Hungary, expressed little or no confidence in Trump. (Adults in Greece were split, and a narrow majority of Hungarians had at least some confidence in Trump to handle that conflict.) In France, Germany, Spain and Sweden, about three-quarters of adults said they had little or no confidence in Trump to handle the war."

Event organizer Yongle Auction said the life-size doll, which is made of hard-plastic PVC, is the only one of its kind.",
      "The auction sold all 48 lots for total sales of 3.73 million yuan, or about $520,000, with nearly 1,000 collectors making bids either in person or online, Yongle said in a statement Wednesday. The event came amid a global frenzy over Labubu, which is sold in \u201cblind boxes\u201d by Chinese toy company Pop Mart.",
      "The \u201cintense\u201d bidding showed the \u201cgrowing momentum of pop art in the auction market,\u201d Yongle said, adding that it will start holding Labubu auctions \u201cregularly.\u201d",
      "The Labubu item that received the second-highest bid was another life-size figure that sold for more than $130,000 and measured 5 feet tall.

      "The success of Labubu at auction reflects the \u201cgrowing presence\u201d of art toys in the market and the progress of Hong Kong and mainland China in setting trends in contemporary culture, said Felix Kwok, a registered auctioneer of China and the founder of Art and Culture Exchange.",

      "Despite the global trade disruptions caused by U.S. tariffs, fans have continued to line up at Pop Mart shops across the world to buy Labubu dolls. Last month, the Chinese retailer even paused Labubu sales in all 16 shops in the U.K. to avoid safety issues following reports of disorderly lines and fights.",
      "In the first three months of this year, Pop Mart\u2019s overseas revenue rose almost 480% overall compared with a year earlier, and nearly 900% in the Americas, according to its quarterly report.",

      "Hundreds of masked rioters attacked police and set homes and cars on fire in the Northern Irish town of Ballymena on Tuesday, in the second successive night of disorder that followed a protest over an alleged sexual assault in the town.",
      "Seventeen officers were injured, bringing to 32 the number hurt since the violence began Monday following a large protest over an alleged sexual assault in the town.",
      "Two 14-year-old boys appeared in court that day, accused of sexually assaulting a teenage girl. The charges were read to the teenagers via a Romanian interpreter, the BBC reported. A lawyer told the court that the two teenagers denied the charge. They were remanded in custody until July 2.",
      "Police are investigating attacks on properties Monday that saw four houses damaged by fire as racially-motivated \u201chate crimes.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe mindless violence witnessed over the past two nights in Ballymena is deeply concerning and utterly unacceptable,\u201d Police Service of Northern Ireland Chief Constable Jon Boutcher said in a statement on Wednesday.",
      "\u201cHate-fueled acts and mob rule do nothing but tear at the fabric of our society... This behavior must stop.\u201d",
      "One Romanian resident told the Irish Times on Tuesday that she was putting a British flag on her front window in a bid to prevent being targeted.

    "summary": "Argentina's highest court upheld a six-year prison sentence for former President Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner in a ruling Tuesday that permanently banned her from public office over a corruption conviction.",
    "story": [
      "BUENOS AIRES, Argentina \u2014 Argentina\u2019s highest court upheld a six-year prison sentence for former President Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner in a ruling Tuesday that permanently banned her from public office over the corruption conviction that found she had directed state contracts to a friend while she was the first lady and president.",
      "The explosive Supreme Court ruling left Fern\u00e1ndez, Argentina\u2019s charismatic yet deeply divisive ex-leader, subject to arrest and sent her supporters pouring into the streets of Buenos Aires, Argentina\u2019s capital, and blocking major highways in protest.",
      "The court asked Argentina\u2019s security ministry to set up a detention center to hold 72-year-old Fern\u00e1ndez. Her defense lawyer Carlos Beraldi told C5N, a television station in Buenos Aires, that he had requested Fern\u00e1ndez be allowed to serve her sentence in house arrest given her age.",
      "The ruling bars Fern\u00e1ndez from running in this fall\u2019s Buenos Aires legislative elections just days after she launched her campaign.",
      "Fern\u00e1ndez \u2014 who dominated Argentine politics for two decades and forged the country\u2019s main left-wing populist movement known as Kirchnerism, after her and her husband, former President N\u00e9stor Kirchner \u2014 rejects the charges as politically motivated.",
      "During Fern\u00e1ndez\u2019s eight years in office (2007\u20132015), Argentina expanded cash payments to the poor and pioneered major social assistance programs. But her governments funded the unbridled state spending by printing money, bringing Argentina notoriety for massive budget deficits and sky-high inflation.",
      "Critics blamed Argentina\u2019s years of economic volatility on Fern\u00e1ndez\u2019s policies, and outrage over successive economic crises and the country\u2019s bloated bureaucracy helped vault radical libertarian President Javier Milei to the presidency in late 2023.",
      "The ruling dealt a severe blow to Milei\u2019s opposition during a crucial midterm election year. He celebrated the ruling, writing on social media: \u201cJustice. Period.\u201d",
      "Fern\u00e1ndez was embroiled in multiple corruption scandals during her tenure. She was convicted in 2022 in this corruption case, which centered on 51 public contracts for public works awarded to companies linked to L\u00e1zaro B\u00e1ez, a convicted construction magnate and friend of the presidential couple, at prices 20% above the standard rate in a scheme that cost the state tens of millions of dollars.",
      "The high court rejected Fern\u00e1ndez\u2019s request for the court to review her prison sentence in March. In a resolution obtained by The Associated Press, the court said that the prison sentence \u201cdoes nothing more than to protect our republican and democratic system.\u201d",
      "The Kirchner governments carried out \u201can extraordinary fraudulent maneuver\u201d that harmed the interests of the government and resulted in the embezzlement of roughly $70 million at the current exchange rate, the resolution said.",
      "Supporters of Fern\u00e1ndez and her political movement blocked main roads into Buenos Aires and stormed the offices of Argentina\u2019s two main cable networks that are widely considered critical of the ex-leader, Channel 13 and Todos Noticias, smashing televisions, vandalizing cars and shattering windows. There were no injuries reported.",
      "Fern\u00e1ndez rejected the decision, calling the court justices \u201cpuppets\u201d of those wielding economic power in the country.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re three puppets answering to those ruling far above them,\u201d she told supporters in a rousing speech outside her party\u2019s headquarters. \u201cIt\u2019s not the opposition. It\u2019s the concentrated economic power of Argentina\u2019s government.\u201d",
      "Gregorio Dalb\u00f3n, one of Fern\u00e1ndez\u2019s lawyers, vowed \u201cto take this case to all international human rights organizations.\u201d",
      "Fern\u00e1ndez has questioned the impartiality of the judges. She claims her defense didn\u2019t have access to much of the evidence and that it was gathered without regard to legal deadlines.",
      "Fern\u00e1ndez faces a series of other upcoming trials on corruption charges."

      "HONG KONG \u2014 Hong Kong police on Tuesday accused a mobile game application of advocating armed revolution and promoting secessionist agendas, saying that those who publish it or share it with others online may risk violating national security laws.",
      "The announcement \u2014 the first to publicly denounce a gaming app \u2014 indicates that authorities are widening the crackdown that has followed anti-government protests in 2019. Authorities have crushed or silenced many dissenting voices through prosecutions under the 2020 national security law imposed by Beijing and a similar, homegrown law enacted last year.",
      "In a statement, police warned residents against downloading the \u201cReversed Front: Bonfire\u201d application, saying those with the app installed might be seen as possessing a publication with a seditious intention.",
      "They also warned people against providing financial assistance to the application developer, including making in-app purchases.",
      "\u201c\u2018Reversed Front: Bonfire\u2019 was released under the guise of a game with the aim of promoting secessionist agendas such as \u2018Taiwan independence\u2019 and \u2018Hong Kong independence,\u2019 advocating armed revolution and the overthrow of the fundamental system of the People\u2019s Republic of China,\u201d police said.",
      "The game application was developed by ESC Taiwan, which did not immediately respond to The Associated Press\u2019 request for comment. On the application\u2019s Facebook page, the developer posted about surging searches for the game name and a Hong Kong broadcaster\u2019s news report about Tuesday\u2019s development.",
      "According to the application\u2019s introduction, players can assume the role of Hong Kong, Tibet, Uyghur, Taiwan or Cathaysian Rebel factions, among others, to overthrow the communist regime. They may also choose to lead the communists to defeat all enemies.",
      "The game\u2019s website says it \u201cis a work of nonfiction. Any similarity to actual agencies, policies or ethnic groups of the PRC in this game is intentional.\u201d",
      "The app was still available on Apple\u2019s App Store on Tuesday night, but could no longer be found on Wednesday morning. The game publisher said last month that Google Play had taken the app down because it did not prohibit users from adopting hateful language in naming.",
      "Apple, Google and Meta have not immediately commented.",
      "After playing the game for about three months, Kuo Hao Fu in Taiwan said he found that its content uses a humorous approach to describe serious political issues. Fu disagreed with the police accusations, saying players can also choose to be part of the force representing China.",
      "\u201cThe Hong Kong police\u2019s actions demonstrate how Hong Kong\u2019s democratic freedoms have been controlled by the Chinese Communist Party,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen even this level cannot be tolerated, it completely destroys creative freedom in gaming.\u201d",
      "China considers Taiwan its own territory, to be brought under its control by force if necessary. Many Taiwanese in the self-ruled island showed concerns about Hong Kong\u2019s declining freedoms under Beijing\u2019s grip.",
      "The Beijing and Hong Kong governments insist the city\u2019s national security laws were necessary to return stability to the city after the protests."
