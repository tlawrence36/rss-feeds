      "A previously unknown musical work written by composer Frederic Chopin appears to have been found in a library in New York City",
      "NEW YORK -- The brooding waltz was carefully composed on a sheet of music roughly the size of an index card. The brief, moody number also bore an intriguing name, written at the top in cursive: \u201cChopin.\u201d",
      "A previously unknown work of music penned by the European master Frederic Chopin appears to have been found at the Morgan Library & Museum in Manhattan.",
      "The untitled and unsigned piece is on display this month at the opulently appointed institution, which had once been the private library of financier J. P. Morgan.",
      "Robinson McClellan, the museum curator who uncovered the manuscript, said it's the first new work associated with the Romantic era composer to be discovered in nearly a century.",
      "But McClellan concedes that it may never be known whether it is an original Chopin work or merely one written in his hand.",
      "The piece, set in the key of A minor, stands out for its \u201cvery stormy, brooding opening section\u201d before transitioning to a melancholy melody more characteristic of Chopin, McClellan explained.",
      "\u201cThis is his style. This is his essence,\u201d he said during a recent visit to the museum. \u201cIt really feels like him.\u201d",
      "McClellan said he came across the work in May as he was going through a collection from the late Arthur Satz, a former president of the New York School of Interior Design. Satz had acquired it from A. Sherrill Whiton Jr., an avid autograph collector who had been director of the school.",
      "McClellan then worked with experts to verify its authenticity.",
      "The paper was found to be consistent with what Chopin favored for manuscripts, and the ink matched a kind typical in the early 19th century when Chopin lived, according to the museum. But a handwriting analysis determined the name \u201cChopin\u201d written at the top of the sheet was penned by someone else.",
      "Born in Poland, Chopin was considered a musical genius from an early age. He lived in Warsaw and Vienna before settling in Paris, where he died in 1849 at the age of 39, likely of tuberculosis.",
      "He\u2019s buried among a pantheon of artists at the city\u2019s famed P\u00e8re Lachaise Cemetery, but his heart, pickled in a jar of alcohol, is housed in a church in Warsaw, in keeping with his deathbed wish for the organ to return to his homeland.",
      "Artur Szklener, director of the Fryderyk Chopin Institute in Warsaw, the Polish capital city where the composer grew up, agreed that the document is consistent with the kinds of ink and paper Chopin used during his early years in Paris.",
      "Musically, the piece evokes the \u201cbrilliant style\u201d that made Chopin a luminary in his time, but it also has features unusual for his compositions, Szklener said.",
      "\u201cFirst of all, it is not a complete work, but rather a certain musical gesture, a theme laced with rather simple piano tricks alluding to a virtuoso style,\" Szklener explained in a lengthy statement released after the document was revealed last month.",
      "He and other experts conjecture the piece could have been a work in progress. It may have also been a copy of another's work, or even co-written with someone else, perhaps a student for a musical exercise.",
      "Jeffrey Kallberg, a University of Pennsylvania music professor and Chopin expert who helped authenticate the document, called the piece a \u201clittle gem\u201d that Chopin likely intended as a gift for a friend or wealthy acquaintance.",
      "\u201cMany of the pieces that he gave as gifts were short \u2013 kind of like \u2018appetizers\u2019 to a full-blown work,\u201d Kallberg said in an email. \u201cAnd we don\u2019t know for sure whether he intended the piece to see the light of day because he often wrote out the same waltz more than once as a gift.\u201d",
      "David Ludwig, dean of music at The Juilliard School, a performing arts conservatory in Manhattan, agreed the piece has many of the hallmarks of the composer\u2019s style.",
      "\u201cIt has the Chopin character of something very lyrical and it has a little bit of darkness as well,\u201d said Ludwig, who was not involved in authenticating the document.",
      "But Ludwig noted that, if it's authentic, the tightly composed score would be one of Chopin\u2019s shortest known pieces. The waltz clocks in at under a minute long when played on piano, as many of Chopin\u2019s works were intended.",
      "\u201cIn terms of the authenticity of it, in a way it doesn\u2019t matter because it sparks our imaginations,\u201d Ludwig said. \u201cA discovery like this highlights the fact that classical music is very much a living art form.\u201d",
      "The Chopin reveal comes after the Leipzig Municipal Libraries in Germany announced in September that it had uncovered a previously unknown piece likely composed by a young Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart in its collections.",

      "Percival Everett\u2019s \u201cJames\u201d has won the National Book Award for fiction",
      "NEW YORK -- Percival Everett's \u201cJames,\u201d a daring reworking of \u201cThe Adventures of Huckleberry Finn,\u201d has won the National Book Award for fiction. Jason De Le\u00f3n\u2019s \u201cSoldiers and Kings: Survival and Hope in the World of Human Smuggling\u201d won for nonfiction, where finalists included Salman Rushdie's memoir about his brutal stabbing in 2022, \u201cKnife.\u201d",
      "The prize for young people's literature was given Wednesday night to Shifa Saltagi Safadi\u2019s coming of age story \u201cKareem Between,\u201d and the poetry award went to Lena Khalaf Tuffaha\u2019s \u201cSomething About Living.\u201d In the translation category, the winner was Y\u00e1ng Shu\u0101ng-z\u01d0\u2019s \u201cTaiwan Travelogue,\u201d translated from the Mandarin Chinese by Lin King.",
      "Judging panels, made up of writers, critics, booksellers and others in the literary community, made their selections from hundreds of submissions, with publishers nominating more than 1,900 books in all. Each of the winners in the five competitive categories received $10,000.",
      "Everett\u2019s win continues his remarkable rise in the past few years. Little known to general readers for decades, the 67-year-old has been a Booker Prize and Pulitzer Prize finalist for such novels as \u201cTrees\u201d and \u201cDr. No\u201d and has seen the novel \u201cErasure\u201d adapted into the Oscar-nominated \u201cAmerican Fiction.\u201d",
      "In taking on Mark Twain\u2019s classic about the wayward Southern boy Huck and the enslaved Jim, Everett tells the story from the latter's perspective and emphasizes how differently Jim behaves and even speaks when whites are not around. The novel was a Booker finalist and last month won the Kirkus Prize for fiction.",
      "\u201cJames\u201d has been nicely received,\u201d Everett noted during his acceptance speech.",
      "\u201cDemon Copperhead\u201d novelist Barbara Kingsolver and Black Classic Press publisher W. Paul Coates received lifetime achievement medals from the National Book Foundation, which presents the awards.",
      "Speakers praised diversity, disruption and autonomy, whether Taiwanese independence or the rights of immigrants in the U.S. Two winners, Safadi and Tuffaha, condemned the year-old Gaza war and U.S. military support for Israel. Neither mentioned Israel by name, but both called the conflict \u201cgenocide\u201d and were met with cheers \u2014 and more subdued responses \u2014 after calling for support of the Palestinians.",
      "Tuffaha, who is Palestinian American, dedicated her award in part to \u201cto all the deeply beautiful Palestinians that this world has lost and all those miraculous ones who endured, waiting for us, waiting for us to wake up.\u201d",
      "Last year publisher Zibby Owens withdrew support for the awards after hearing that finalists were planning to condemn the Gaza war. This year the World Jewish Congress was among those criticizing Coates\u2019 award, citing in part his reissue of the essay \u201cThe Jewish Onslaught,\u201d which has been called anti-Semitic.",
      "National Book Foundation Executive Director Ruth Dickey said in a recent statement that Coates was being honored for a body of work rather than any individual book, and added that while the foundation condemns anti-Semitism and other forms of bigotry, it also believes in free expression.",
      "\u201cAnyone examining the work of any publisher, over the course of almost five decades, will find individual works or opinions with which they disagree or find offensive,\u201d she added.",
      "The National Book Awards have long taken place in mid-November, shortly after the elections, and they're an early snapshot of the book world's reaction: Hopeful after Barack Obama's victory in 2008, when publisher and honorary winner Barney Rosset anticipated \u201ca new and uplifting agenda\u201d; grim but determined in 2016, after Donald Trump's first victory, with fiction winner Colson Whitehead urging the audience to \u201cbe kind to everybody, make art, and fight the power.\u201d",
      "This year, as hundreds gathered for the dinner ceremony at Cipriani Wall Street in downtown Manhattan for the awards' 75th anniversary, the mood was one of sobriety, resolve and willed good cheer.",
      "Host Kate McKinnon joked that she was recruited because the National Book Foundation wanted \u201csomething fun and light and to distract from the fact that the world is a bonfire.\u201d Musical guest Jon Batiste led the audience in a round of \u201cWhen the Saints Go Marching In\u201d and sang a few lines from \u201cHallelujah,\u201d the Leonard Cohen standard which McKinnon somberly performed at the start of the first \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d after the 2016 election.",
      "Kingsolver acknowledged feeling \u201csmacked down, at the moment,\u201d but added that she has known despair before. She likened truth and love to forces of nature, like gravity and the sun, always there whether you see them or not. The writer's job is to imagine \u201ca better ending than the one we've been given,\" she said.",
      "At a Tuesday night reading by awards finalists, some spoke of community and support. Everett began his turn by confiding that he really \u201cneeded this kind of inspiration after the last couple of weeks. We kind of need each other right now.\u201d After warning that \u201chope is not a strategy,\u201d he paused and said, \u201cNever had a situation felt so absurd, surreal and ridiculous.\u201d",
      "It took a moment to realize he wasn't discussing current events, but rather reading from \u201cJames.\u201d"

      "It was mostly Chris Stapleton\u2019s night at the Country Music Association Awards",
      "Chris Stapleton took home four Country Music Association Awards and hardly left the stage on Wednesday night, while an absent Morgan Wallen was shut out all evening until taking the night's biggest prize, entertainer of the year.",
      "Stapleton's wins included song of the year and single of the year for \u201cWhite Horse,\u201d and he took the stage at the Bridgestone Arena in Nashville, Tennessee, three times to perform during the ABC telecast, including a show-opening duet with Post Malone.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m really honored for this, thank you very much,\" the always subdued country traditionalist Stapleton said as he accepted the male vocalist of the year award for a record-extending eighth time.",
      "For much of the night it seemed the leading nominee Wallen, up for seven, would be shut out, until presenter Jeff Bridges gave a botched rendering of his name as \"Morgan Waylon\" when he announced entertainer of the year.",
      "Four of Wallen's nominations came for his hit collaboration with Malone, \u201cI Had Some Help,\" though the song, and the first-time nominee Malone, went winless.",
      "But the rapper-singer Malone was all smiles all night at the CMAs after releasing his first country album earlier in the year. With Stapleton, he sang his song \u201cCalifornia Sober\u201d in full cowboy regalia, including a bolo tie as big as a belt buckle. He later took the stage solo to sing the emotional \u201cYours,\u201d which he dedicated to his young daughter.",
      "Stapleton later performed his own \u201cWhat Am I Gonna Do\u201d with his wife Morgane, and performed yet again as part of an all-star tribute to George Strait, who received the Willie Nelson Lifetime Achievement Award.",
      "Last year\u2019s entertainer of the year, Lainey Wilson, hosted the show along with Luke Bryan and NFL great Peyton Manning, and won two CMAs \u2014 female vocalist of the year, and best music video for \u201cWildflowers and Wild Horses.\u201d",
      "For a while it seemed Stapleton would get a sweep, but he lost out on album of the year to a surprised Cody Johnson, who took the trophy for \u201cLeather.\u201d",
      "\u201cI thought Chris Stapleton or Jelly Roll was going to win,\u201d Johnson said.",
      "Old Dominion won vocal group of the year for a record seventh straight time, surpassing the six won by Little Big Town.",
      "The Stapleton-Malone opening and much of the night were a celebration of a time of crossover and collaboration in country.",
      "The telecast, available on Hulu for streaming Thursday, featured performances from artist combos including Brooks & Dunn, representing the 1990s and 2000s, with Jelly Roll, representing country's current moment. They gave an emotional gospel-style performance of Brooks & Dunn's 2005 song \u201cBelieve.\"",
      "Brooks & Dunn followed it up by winning vocal duo of the year for the 15th time and the first time since 2006.",
      "Shaboozey brought the crowd to its feet with a solo performance that began with a bit of his more sober single \u201cHighway\u201d before launching into one of the year's defining hits, \u201cA Bar Song (Tipsy).\"",
      "But he lost out on best new artist to Megan Moroney, who won minutes after her own performance.",
      "\u201cThank you Jesus for putting this dream on my heart,\u201d Moroney, a 27-year-old from Georgia, said with misty eyes as she accepted the award.",
      "Wilson opened the tribute to Strait by singing part of his best remembered hit, \u201cAmarillo by Morning.\u201d",
      "She was followed by Jamey Johnson, Miranda Lambert, Parker McCollum, Stapleton and Strait contemporary Clint Black, who performed pieces of Strait hits including \u201cTroubadour\u201d and \u201cHonky Tonk Hall of Fame\u201d",
      "Stapleton handed the 72-year-old Strait the award previously won by Dolly Parton, Johnny Cash, Charley Pride and Nelson himself, calling Strait \u201ctrue country music royalty, the king of country.\u201d",
      "A smiling Strait thanked everyone for the strong renditions of his songs.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m glad I got 'em first,\u201d he said.",

    "summary": "Two television networks with &ldquo;NBC&rdquo; in their names &mdash; MSNBC and CNBC &mdash; will no longer have any corporate connection to NBC News once a spinoff formally takes effect in about a year",
    "story": [
      "Two television networks with \u201cNBC\u201d in their names \u2014 MSNBC and CNBC \u2014 will no longer have any corporate connection to NBC News once a spinoff formally takes effect in about a year",
      "Comcast's corporate reorganization means that there will soon be two television networks with \u201cNBC\u201d in their name \u2014 CNBC and MSNBC \u2014 that will no longer have any corporate connection to NBC News.",
      "How that affects viewers of those networks, along with the people who work there, still needs to shake out. Their new corporate leader, Mark Lazarus, visited the set of MSNBC's \u201cMorning Joe\u201d as the plan was being announced on Wednesday and spoke to network staff members during a morning conference call to address concerns.",
      "Comcast is spinning off most of its cable networks, also including USA, Oxygen, E!, SYFY and the Golf Channel, into a separate company. That recognizes how streaming is considered the future and the cable networks are a drag on the bottom line.",
      "In the space of a lifetime, the networks went from upstarts aside a legacy operation like NBC to profitable superstars to castoffs.",
      "Lazarus, chairman of the NBC Universal Media Group, is becoming CEO of the newly-formed company of cable networks, temporarily dubbed \u201cSpinCo.\u201d Cesar Conde, who as NBC Universal News Group chairman had oversight of CNBC and MSNBC, will lose those networks from his portfolio, yet remain in charge of NBC News, NBC News Now streaming, Telemundo and the news operations of the NBC-owned local stations.",
      "The presence of Lazarus and Anand Kini, who will be chief operating officer and chief financial officer of SpinCo, is a good sign for the new company, said Jessica Reif Ehrlich, research analyst for the Bank of America. \u201cYou can't dismiss it as getting rid of the crappy assets, because these are talented executives,\u201d she said.",
      "At MSNBC, questions about the future range from the simple \u2014 will it even keep its name? \u2014 to the complex.",
      "MSNBC's staff and studios are based in the same Rockefeller Center offices as NBC News, and it was unclear on Wednesday whether they will remain or move elsewhere, Lazarus told MSNBC employees.",
      "MSNBC's relationship with NBC News has caused some awkwardness, particularly as the network has become known for its stable of liberal commentators while still attached to a news division that stresses impartiality. For much of MSNBC's broadcast day, NBC News journalists like Katy Tur, Jose Diaz-Balart, Chris Jansing and a host of reporters appear on the network.",
      "It's unclear whether arrangements could be made for that cross-pollination to continue \u2014 where will Steve Kornacki land, for example? \u2014 or if MSNBC will bear the expense of building out its own newsgathering operation or lean more heavily into commentary.",
      "It's a nervous time at MSNBC for other reasons. The network has seen a dramatic drop in viewership since Donald Trump's election victory, although it is common that news networks that appeal primarily to one side of a political divide lose viewers when their candidates are defeated. History shows most viewers return, and MSNBC executives anticipate that.",
      "Less clear is whether a second Trump administration will make life difficult. Trump ally Steve Bannon, on his radio show last week, sent out a specific warning to the network's anchors and producers. \u201cYou better be worried,\u201d he said. \u201cYou better lawyer up.\u201d",
      "CNBC launched in 1989, while MSNBC started in 1996. They have seemed inextricably bound with the broadcast network since, and the sharing of legal, promotional, technical and other support is something else that needs to be worked out.",
      "With its financial concentration, CNBC has been more independent of NBC News than its cable brethren. With offices in Englewood Cliffs, N.J., its operation is even physically separate. However, NBC News often taps CNBC reporters for their business expertise on broadcast and its streaming service.",
      "For both MSNBC and CNBC, the current sharing of legal, promotional, technical and other support services with NBC News will have to be worked out.",
      "\u201cI completely empathize with people who think this would be a bittersweet thing,\u201d Lazarus said, according to MSNBC. \u201cI think it's exciting because very few times in life you get to have the opportunity to be part of what I'll call a \u2018well-funded startup.\u2019\u201d",
      "Despite the old-school nature of a company of cable properties, Comcast executives are bullish on its prospects, noting that many of them produce profits individually. And there's the potential for buying other networks undervalued by big media companies.",
      "Andrew Ross Sorkin, host of CNBC's \u201cSquawk Box,\u201d said on \u201cMorning Joe\u201d Wednesday that the two cable news networks produce \u201dextraordinary profits\" for Comcast that are not being reinvested in cable properties.",
      "\"If you could take that money that's coming off of these channels and invest in the businesses as an independent entity, what will that ultimately look like\"?\" Sorkin asked. \u201cCould you use that money to go make other acquisitions? Could you make investments in the business itself? That's the big question.\u201d",
      "One piece of advice from Bank of America's Ehrlich: Keep the names. \u201cThose are pretty big brand names,\u201d she said. \u201cI would not advise them to change.\u201d",

The Anglican church called it a sin, the newspapers labeled it Frankenstein-ish and other scientists warned of freak babies. \u201cYou\u2019re aware they\u2019ll throw the book at us,\u201d Nighy's Steptoe tells the team. \u201cWe will unite them all against us.\u201d",
      "Purdy, a single woman as the swinging \u201860s lead to the \u201970s, is exiled by her own pious mother \u2014 \u201cYou can\u2019t play God with this,\u201d the elder woman tells her daughter \u2014 and disinvited by her church. No matter. \u201cThis fight is ours. We don\u2019t have a choice,\u201d Purdy says. The film also celebrates the brave would-be mothers who volunteered their bodies to be poked and prodded at the edge of science.",
      "Our hero researchers try to argue to the skeptical world in vain that IVF is simply a way for science to help those in need, like glasses for the shortsighted or dentures for those with teeth decay. It's remarkable to return to this debate now when science's great achievements today may be under threat, like fluoridated water.",
      "Director Ben Taylor keeps the story small and intimate, a series of vignettes adding up to almost like a play. It features moments of quiet and polite bravery, and small conversations over a pint of ale \u2014 a reminder of the power of performances and that changing the world doesn't need a muscle-bound bro with X-ray vision.",
      "It's held together by a superb soundtrack with witty selections like \u201cYes We Can Can\u201d by Lee Dorsey, \u201cNobody But Me\u201d by The Human Beinz and \u201cHere Comes the Sun\u201d by George Harrison, each song encapsulating the moment in time, like pearls on a strand.",
      "\u201cJoy\u201d is not all joy. There is frustration and loss and tears along the way, but it is a triumphant film about the way humans can make the world better and how a baby's cry can be a priceless gift.",
      "\u201cJoy,\u201d a Netflix release, is rated PG-13 for \u201cthematic material brief strong language, some sexual references and surgery images.\u201d Running time: 115 minutes. Three and a half stars out of four."

      "President-elect Donald Trump is clearly prizing experience on television as he chooses people to serve in his new administration",
      "WASHINGTON -- There's a common trait that President-elect Donald Trump is clearly prizing as he selects those to serve in his new administration: experience on television.",
      "Trump loves that \"central casting\" look, as he likes to call it.",
      "Some, like his choices for defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, and transportation secretary, Sean Duffy, were until recently TV hosts on Trump's favorite network, Fox News. Mike Huckabee, his pick for U.S. ambassador to Israel, hosted the Fox show \u201cHuckabee\u201d from 2008 to 2015 after his time as Arkansas governor.",
      "Dr. Mehmet Oz, a former syndicated talk show host and heart surgeon, was tapped Tuesday to head the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the agency that oversees health insurance programs for millions of older, poor and disabled Americans. He would report to Trump's choice for health and human services secretary, Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., himself a regular on the cable news circuit.",
      "Trump, a former reality television star himself, has made no secret of his intention to stack his administration with loyalists after his decisive 2024 election win \u2014 including some whose lack of relevant experience has raised concerns among lawmakers. But he's also working to set up a more forceful administration in this term, and in his eyes, many of those people happen to intersect with celebrity.",
      "The trend was not lost on Democratic Rep. Jim Himes of Connecticut, who posted on social media after the Oz nomination: \u201cWe are becoming the world\u2019s first nuclear-armed reality television show.\u201d",
      "For good measure, Himes added: \u201cJust spitballing here, but what if the Attorney General and the Secretary of HHS fight each other in an octagonal cage?\u201d That was a reference to Trump's affinity for the UFC fighters who do battle in the octagon.",
      "Choosing TV personalities isn't that unusual for the once-and-future president: A number of his first-term choices \u2014 John Bolton, Larry Kudlow, Heather Nauert and Mercedes Schlapp, were all on TV \u2014 mostly also on Fox. Omarosa Manigault Newman, a confrontational first-season member of Trump's NBC show \u201cThe Apprentice,\" was briefly at the White House before she was fired.",
      "Former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, a Republican who ran Trump\u2019s 2016 transition team until he was fired, said that eight years ago, Trump held \u201cApprentice-like interviews at Bedminster,\u201d summoning potential hires to his club in New Jersey.",
      "On a call on Tuesday organized by the Council on Foreign Relations, Christie said this year\u2019s Cabinet choices are different than 2016\u2019s but it\u2019s still \u201cDonald Trump casting a TV show.\u201d",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s casting,\u201d Christie said.",
      "Trump has readily highlighted the media experience of his choices as he's announced them. He said Duffy, a former lawmaker and onetime cast member of MTV\u2019s \u201cThe Real World,\" was \u201ca STAR on Fox News.\u201d",
      "Hegseth, a military veteran, \u201chas been a host at FOX News for eight years, where he used that platform to fight for our Military and Veterans,\u201d Trump said. He also noted that Hegseth's book \u201cThe War on Warriors\u201d spent nine weeks on The New York Times \u201cbest-sellers list, including two weeks at NUMBER ONE.\u201d",
      "As for Oz, Trump said: \u201cHe won nine Daytime Emmy Awards hosting \u2018The Dr. Oz Show,\u2019 where he taught millions of Americans how to make healthier lifestyle choices.\"",
      "It's also true that those seeking positions in Trump's orbit often take to the airwaves to audition for an audience of one. Tom Homan, Trump's choice for \u201cborder czar,\u201d is a frequent Fox contributor. Ohio Sen. JD Vance was chosen as Trump's running mate in part because of how well he comes across on air.",
      "Trump's choice to lead the Federal Communications Commission, Brendan Carr, upped his profile when he took to Fox News to argue that a pre-election appearance on NBC's \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d by Democratic nominee Kamala Harris was a violation of the \u201cequal time\u201d rule governing candidate appearances on television.",
      "The White House-to-cable news pundit pipeline tends to cut across administrations of both parties, to some extent. President Joe Biden had three MSNBC contributors on his transition team and his former press secretary went to the network after she left the White House. Biden, though, looked to career diplomats, longtime government workers and military leaders for key posts like the Defense Department.",
      "Trump's affinity for Fox News is well-documented, though the romance cooled for a time after Fox made an early call of Arizona for Biden in 2020, a move that infuriated Trump and many of the network\u2019s viewers. Trump suggested viewers should migrate to other conservative news outlets.",
      "While the Arizona call ultimately proved correct, it set in motion internal second-guessing and led some Fox personalities to embrace conspiracy theories, which ultimately cost the network $787 million to settle a defamation lawsuit by Dominion Voting Systems.",
      "But Trump is still an avid watcher \u2014 the network provides Trump a window into conservative thinking, with commentary from Republican lawmakers and thinkers who are, often, speaking directly to the president-elect.",

      "Comcast is spinning off into a new company many of its cable television networks that were once at the heart of the entertainment giant, as consumers increasingly swap out their cable TV subscriptions for streaming platforms",
      "WASHINGTON -- Comcast is spinning off into a new company many of the cable television networks that were once at the entertainment giant's heart as consumers increasingly swap out their cable TV subscriptions for streaming platforms.",
      "Those one-time stars for Comcast's NBCUniversal cable television networks include USA, Oxygen, E!, SYFY and Golf Channel, as well as CNBC and MSNBC. Movie ticketing platform Fandango and the Rotten Tomatoes movie rating site will also become part of the new company.",
      "Streaming service Peacock will remain with Comcast, as will Bravo, which provides significant content for the Peacock streaming service, and other assets like the NBCUniversal's studios and theme parks.",
      "Comcast telegraphed the shift last month, before confirming Wednesday that it will spin off assets that generated about $7 billion in revenue over the past 12 months ending Sept. 30. That\u2019s about 5.5% of Comcast\u2019s total revenue during that period, according to the company.",
      "How exactly this split will impact customers is not yet clear. Experts maintain it\u2019s too early to tell, given that Comcast aims to complete the transition over the next year.",
      "Some analysts speculate that the spun-off networks may have more freedom to bring their content elsewhere. That could mean you'll have more options to find and curate what you want to watch and where \u2014 or headaches from juggling several different subscriptions in an already-fractured media landscape.",
      "Wednesday's announcement arrives as more and more people \u201ccut the cord\u201d on cable, with millions canceling service subscriptions every year \u2014 and instead signing up for streaming platforms.",
      "Paul Verna, principal analyst and vice president of content for market research company eMarketer, said Comcast\u2019s decision to divest itself from most of its cable TV channels is a reflection of that trend.",
      "\u201cThe writing is on the wall that the cable TV business is a dwindling business,\u201d Verna said. \u201cThat\u2019s why Comcast did what it did today.\u201d",
      "Mike Proulx, a vice president and research director of Forrester, added that the spin-off marks \u201csimply a reconciliation of assets that detract from the company\u2019s inevitable all streaming future.\u201d",
      "Comcast expects the new company, which it referred to as \u201cSpinCo\u201d Wednesday, to have the financial flexibility to be \u201ca potential partner and acquirer of other complementary media businesses.\u201d And Mark Lazarus, the current chairman of NBCUniversal Media Group who will serve as the new entity\u2019s CEO, said Wednesday that the standalone company \u201cwill be better positioned to serve our audiences and drive shareholder returns.\u201d",
      "Like other cable companies, Comcast in recent years has shifted its business emphasis away from traditional cable toward streaming and other sources of revenue, such as its movie studio, theme parks and home wireless and internet services.",
      "Despite a slightly confusing, glitchy start, Peacock has been one of the company's biggest success stories, with recent boosts gained in part by the streaming platform's popularity during the 2024 Paris Olympic Games. In its most recent quarter, Comcast reported that paid Peacock subscribers jumped by 3 million, or 29%, to 36 million subscribers. Peacock\u2019s revenue soared 82% to $1.5 billion in the period.",
      "Dropping \u201cmoney-losing assets\u201d to instead focus on these kinds of lucrative business is clearly beneficial to Comcast, Verna said \u2014 but the future of a new company housing primarily cable networks is less promising. He said he finds it hard \u201cto envision that this company will stay independent for a long time,\" predicting future consolidation of the networks or acquisitions through private equity.",
      "Howard Gutman, private equity strategy and coverage lead for MorganFranklin Consulting, also expects consolidation to be in the cards. He noted the spin-off might entice bigger streaming services that are in search of more content, for example, to buy up these kinds of assets.",
      "That could mean watchers of the Golf Channel, for example, finding its content on what were once rival platforms. But the spun-off assets might also find more power to focus on priorities specific to them under a smaller company umbrella, Gutman added. That would potentially open the door for networks like CNBC to further monetize its own content or expand its brand.",
      "\u201cI think it will open up opportunities,\u201d he said, adding that customers will also have more options to curate subscriptions based on what interests them the most.",
      "Verna is less optimistic. He pointed to a history of changes in the media landscape that has repeatedly been tough for consumers.",
      "People already have a hard time figuring out where to watch or stream something they're looking for, Verna said, and deals to license or spread that out further could worsen that. And paying for more and more services adds up, particularly as platforms have hiked prices over time.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s too early to know what impact (the Comcast spin-offs) will have .... But I wouldn\u2019t hold my breath (on there being) a net benefit to consumers,\u201d Verna said. \u201cConsumers are the ones who are supposed to be driving these trends, and to some extent they are. But they also tend to get the short end of the stick every time.\u201d",
      "The spin-off is targeted for completion in about a year, the entertainment giant said Wednesday, pending financing and approval from its board and government regulators.",
      "Beyond Lazarus' appointment to CEO of the new company, Anand Kini, the current chief financial officer of NBCUniversal, will take on the same title with the new company as well as the chief operating officer role.",
      "Shares of Comcast, based in Philadelphia, ended up 1.6% Wednesday.",
      "Comcast reported revenue of more than $32 billion and profit of $1.12 per share in its most recent quarter, boosted by the summer box-office success of \"Despicable Me 4,\" which grossed more than $1 billion worldwide.",

      "\u201cComedian,\u201d by Italian artist Maurizio Cattelan, was a phenomenon when it debuted in 2019 at Art Basel Miami Beach, as festivalgoers tried to make out whether the single yellow piece of fruit affixed to a white wall with silver duct tape was a joke or cheeky commentary on questionable standards among art collectors. At one point, another artist took the banana off the wall and ate it.",
      "The piece attracted so much attention that it had to be withdrawn from view. But three editions sold for between $120,000 and $150,000, according to the gallery handling sales at the time.",
      "Five years later, Justin Sun, founder of cryptocurrency platform TRON, has now paid more than 40 times that higher price point at the Sotheby\u2019s auction. Or, more accurately, Sun purchased a certificate of authenticity that gives him the authority to duct-tape a banana to a wall and call it \u201cComedian.\u201d",
      "The piece attracted heavy attention at the busy auction at Sotheby's, with attendees in the crowded room holding up phones to take photos as two handlers wearing white gloves stood at both sides of the banana.",
      "Bidding started at $800,000 and within minutes shot up to $2 million, then $3 million, then $4 million, and higher, as the auctioneer, Oliver Barker, joked \u201cDon't let it slip away.\u201d",
      "\u201cDon\u2019t miss this opportunity,\" Barker said. \u201cThese are words I've never thought I'd say: Five million dollars for a banana.\u201d",
      "The final hammer price announced in the room was $5.2 million, which didn't include the about $1 million in auction house fees, paid by the buyer.",
      "In a statement, Sun said the piece \u201crepresents a cultural phenomenon that bridges the worlds of art, memes, and the cryptocurrency community.\u201d But he said the latest version of \u201cComedian\" won't last long.",
      "\u201cAdditionally, in the coming days, I will personally eat the banana as part of this unique artistic experience, honoring its place in both art history and popular culture,\u201d Sun said.",

      "The sale came a day after a painting by the Belgian surrealist Ren\u00e9 Magritte sold for $121.2 million, a record for the artist, at a separate auction.",

      "Alec Baldwin\u2019s Western \u201cRust\u201d had its world premiere Wednesday at a film festival in Poland, three years after the shooting death of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins on the set",
      "TORUN, Poland -- Alec Baldwin\u2019s Western \u201cRust\u201d had its world premiere Wednesday at a film festival in Poland with a dedication to cinematographer Halyna Hutchins, who was fatally shot in an accident on the set three years ago.",
      "Organizers called for a minute of silence before showing the film, which opened to a full house at the International Film Festival of the Art of Cinematography Camerimage in the city of Torun, and received applause at the end.",
      "Baldwin, the lead actor and co-producer, was pointing a gun at Hutchins during a rehearsal outside Santa Fe, New Mexico, in October 2021 when the revolver went off, killing Hutchins and wounding director Joel Souza. Baldwin has said he pulled back the hammer \u2014 but not the trigger \u2014 and the revolver fired.",
      "Souza introduced the film at the festival, a popular industry event dedicated to cinematography. He told the audience that initially after the accident he could not have imagined continuing with the production, or even working on a movie set or writing again.",
      "\u201cIt just hurt too much,\u201d he said.",
      "But Hutchins' husband, Matthew, wanted the film to be finished, and came on as an executive producer.",
      "\u201cIt was important to him that the people who knew and loved Halyna get to see her final work,\" Souza said. The mission became \u201cto preserve every single frame that I could of hers, and to honor her final work.\u201d",
      "\u201cRust\u201d \u2014 which includes scene after scene of shootouts \u2014 is the story of a 13-year-old boy who is sentenced to be hanged after he fatally shoots a rancher by accident. He goes on the run with his estranged grandfather, played by Baldwin.",
      "Bianca Cline, the cinematographer who finished the project, said Hutchins established the look and feel of the film, and filmed more than half of it. She studied Hutchins' notes to honor her vision.",
      "Hutchins, 42, was a Ukrainian cinematographer on the rise and a mother of a young son. She grew up on a remote Soviet military base and worked on documentary films in Eastern Europe before studying film in Los Angeles and embarking on a promising movie-making career.",
      "Ahead of the premiere, Hutchins\u2019 mother, who is suing Baldwin and the production, said she was refusing to attend and that she viewed the film as an attempt by Baldwin to \u201cunjustly profit\u201d from her daughter\u2019s death. Baldwin was also not present.",
      "\u201cIt was always my hope to meet my daughter in Poland to watch her work come alive on screen,\" said Hutchins\u2019 mother, Olga Solovey, in a statement issued by her lawyer, Gloria Allred. \u201cAlec Baldwin continues to increase my pain with his refusal to apologize to me and his refusal to take responsibility for her death.\"",
      "Melina Spadone, a representative for Rust Movie Productions, issued a statement saying: \u201cGloria Allred\u2019s misrepresentation of both the Camerimage festival and any profit motivation is disappointing. The decision to complete \u2018Rust\u2019 was made with the full support of Halyna\u2019s family.\"",
      "\"The Camerimage festival celebrates the artistry of cinematographers; it is not a festival for buyers. None of the producers of Rust stand to benefit financially from the film. The suggestion that those involved in completing Halyna Hutchins\u2019 film were motivated by profit is disrespectful to those who worked tirelessly to honor her legacy.\u201d",
      "Filmmaker Rachel Mason, a friend of Hutchins who was tapped by Matthew Hutchins to make a documentary about his late wife, told the audience that Solovey told her that she wanted the film to be completed because of how important the project was to her daughter.",
      "Mason also described all those who continued to work on the film after the tragedy on set as \u201cheroic.\u201d",
      "\u201cYou could just feel and see the trauma that they had gone through,\u201d she said.",
      "\u201cHalyna didn\u2019t get the chance to do the biggest films that she was expected to do, that we all knew she would. \u2018Rust\u2019 was that film. \u2018Rust\u2019 was going to change her life but instead it took her life. And the people that feel the pain of that most are the people that made the film,\u201d Mason said. \u201cI really hope the world can understand that it was a courageous act to complete this film.\u201d",
      "A New Mexico judge dismissed an involuntary manslaughter charge against Baldwin in the fatal shooting. The case was thrown out halfway through trial on allegations that police and prosecutors withheld evidence from the defense.",
      "The film armorer, Hannah Gutierrez-Reed, received the maximum sentence of 18 months in jail for involuntary manslaughter. A judge found that her recklessness amounted to a serious violent offense. Prosecutors blamed Gutierrez-Reed for unwittingly bringing live ammunition onto the set of \u201cRust,\u201d where it was expressly prohibited, and for failing to follow basic gun-safety protocols.",
      "This year's Camerimage festival, where Cate Blanchett is serving as jury president, has already been beset by controversy.",
      "\u201cBlitz\u201d director Steve McQueen dropped out of the festival to protest an editorial about female cinematographers written by festival founder Marek \u017bydowicz in which he argued that greater representation of female cinematographers could lead to mediocrity.",

      "A sudden blizzard forces the team to seek shelter in their small plane. Plunging temperatures cause equipment, including some of their weapons, to malfunction. Powerful winds tear the plane from its moorings and send it skittering upside down across the ice. The ice cracks, threatening to drop the plane into the sea. And the bear, whose white coat makes him all but impossible to see in the landscape of snow and ice, is still hunting them.",
      "The crew sees salvation in the form of a ship\u2019s hull in the near distance, but when they flee from the plane and scramble aboard, they discover that it is the SS Baychimo, a legendary ghost ship that has been floating around the Arctic since it was abandoned by its crew in 1931.",

    "story": [
      "A push by New York City jail officials to block people detained at Rikers Island from receiving physical mail was based on faulty fentanyl test strips that overstated the influx of contraband sent through the mail",
      "NEW YORK -- In 2022, New York City\u2019s jails commissioner, Louis Molina, issued a dire warning to local lawmakers: fentanyl was pouring into Rikers Island through the mail, he said, spurring an overdose crisis among the jail's detainees and putting guards at risk.",
      "As evidence of the insidious threat, Molina passed around a child\u2019s drawing of a reindeer, one of hundreds of seized items he said had been \u201cliterally soaked in the drug and mailed to people in custody.\u201d",
      "But that claim was based on faulty drug-testing kits with a stunning 85% false positive rate, according to a report released Wednesday by the city\u2019s Department of Investigation. The report found the city vastly overstated the prevalence of fentanyl sent by mail to detainees.",
      "When investigators retested 71 pieces of mail initially flagged by field tests as containing fentanyl, only 10 actually showed traces of the drug. The drawing of a reindeer highlighted by Molina was fentanyl-free.",
      "Field tests indicating an influx of fentanyl-laced mail to Rikers Island fueled a yearslong campaign by Mayor Eric Adams\u2019 administration to bar people in city custody from receiving physical mail.",
      "As a replacement, city officials proposed redirecting mail to an offsite vendor, who would then upload it digitally for the incarcerated person to read on a tablet \u2014 a practice used in other correctional systems, including New York's state prisons. So far, the proposal has been blocked by a jail oversight board.",
      "Jocelyn Strauber, the commissioner of the Department of Investigation, said the city should reassess its ongoing effort to bar detainees from receiving mail, given the report\u2019s findings.",
      "\u201cThe field tests don\u2019t support a concern that a high rate of fentanyl-laced objects are coming in from the mail,\u201d she told The Associated Press. \u201cTo the extent policy determinations are based on flawed data, they ought to be reconsidered.\u201d",
      "Detainee advocates have long contended that drugs primarily enter the jail system via employees, who can easily smuggle them inside and sell them to gang leaders. In recent years, dozens of correction officers have been charged in multiple investigations of smuggling rings on Rikers Island.",

      "Women's health advocates in Africa are worried that U.S. President-elect Donald Trump will again invoke the so-called global gag rule, a policy that cuts off U.S. government funding for groups that offer abortion-related services",
      "EPWORTH, Zimbabwe -- Carrying her infant daughter, 19-year-old Sithulisiwe Moyo waited two hours to get birth-control pills from a tent pitched in a poor settlement on the outskirts of Zimbabwe\u2019s capital, Harare.",
      "The outreach clinic in Epworth provides Moyo with her best shot at achieving her dream of returning to school. \u201cI am too young to be a baby-making machine,\" she said. \"At least this clinic helps me avoid another pregnancy.\u201d",
      "But the free service funded by the U.S. government, the world\u2019s largest health donor, might soon be unavailable.",
      "As he did in his first term, U.S President-elect Donald Trump is likely in January to invoke the so-called global gag rule, a policy that bars U.S. foreign aid from being used to perform abortions or provide abortion information. The policy cuts off American government funding for services that women around the world rely on to avoid pregnancy or to space out their children, as well as for heath care unrelated to abortion.",
      "The gag rule has a 40-year history of being applied by Republican presidents and rescinded by Democratic presidents. Every GOP president since the mid-1980s has invoked the rule, which is known as the Mexico City Policy for the city where it was first announced.",
      "As one of his first acts as president in 2017, Trump expanded the rule to the extent that foreign NGOs were cut off from about $600 million in U.S. family planning funds and more than $11 billion in U.S. global health aid between 2017 and 2018 alone, according to the U.S. Government Accountability Office, the investigative arm of Congress.",
      "The money \u2014 much of it intended for Africa \u2014 covered efforts such as preventing malaria and tuberculosis, providing water and sanitation, and distributing health information and contraception, which might also have repercussions for HIV prevention.",
      "Women\u2019s health advocates are \u201cuneasy\u201d following Trump\u2019s victory, said Pester Siraha, director of Population Services Zimbabwe, an affiliate of MSI Reproductive Choices, an NGO that supports abortion rights in 36 countries.",
      "The policy stipulates that foreign NGOs that receive U.S government funding must agree to stop abortion-related activities, including discussing it as a family planning option \u2014 even when they are using non-U.S. government funds for such activities. During Trump's first term, MSI did not agree to those conditions, effectively making it ineligible for U.S government funding.",
      "Siraha said that a blueprint offered to Trump by the conservative-leaning Heritage Foundation in its plan known as Project 2025 indicates that the new administration could enact \u201ca more comprehensive global gag rule.\u201d",
      "Even NGOs in countries that outlaw abortion, such as Zimbabwe, are affected. Population Services Zimbabwe, for instance, closed its outreach clinics during Trump\u2019s first term after losing funding due to its association with MSI Reproductive Choices. Such outreach clinics are often the only health care option for rural people with limited access to hospitals due to poverty or distance.",
      "\u201cIt leaves women with no place to turn for help, even for information,\u201d said Whitney Chinogwenya, global marketing manager at MSI Reproductive Choices.",
      "Some NGOs in other African countries such as Uganda, Ghana, Ethiopia, Kenya and South Africa rolled back services, including clinics, contraception, training and support for government and community health workers, as well as programs for young people, sex workers and LGBTIQ+ communities.",
      "Other services shut down entirely. The risk of unplanned pregnancies, unsafe abortions and related deaths increased in many of the affected countries, according to the U.S.-based Guttmacher Institute, which supports abortion rights.",
      "Chinogwenya, the MSI Reproductive Choices marketing manager, said her organization\u2019s donor income dropped by $120 million during Trump\u2019s first term. The money would have provided 8 million women globally with family planning help, preventing 6 million unintended pregnancies, 1.8 million unsafe abortions and 20,000 pregnancy-related deaths, she said.",
      "The gag-rule policy \u201cleads to more unintended, unwanted, unsupportable pregnancies and therefore an increase in abortion,\u201d said Catriona Macleod, a professor of psychology at South Africa\u2019s Rhodes University.",
      "\u201cThis legislation does not protect life \u2026 it\u2019s been called America\u2019s deadly export,\u201d said Macleod, who heads the university\u2019s studies in sexuality and reproduction.",
      "Trump's transition team did not respond to a request for comment from The Associated Press.",
      "President Joe Biden rescinded the gag-rule policy in 2021, resulting in Population Services Zimbabwe receiving $9 million, about 50% of its donor funding, from USAID in 2023. \u201cBut we haven\u2019t regained all the loss we suffered,\u201d said Siraha, the organization\u2019s director.",
      "\u201cYou need a minimum of five years to have an impact. If we then have another gap of five years, it means we are reversing all the gains,\u201d she said.",
      "Her organization estimates that 1.3 million women could lose out on the care they need in Zimbabwe, leading to an additional 461,000 unintended pregnancies and 1,400 maternal deaths if the gag rule is reinstated.",
      "Overseas aid budget cuts by other Western governments will make it harder to find alternative funding, Siraha said.",
      "MSI Reproductive Choices is lobbying world leaders and alternative donors to fight for abortion rights.",
      "\u201cTrump\u2019s reelection may embolden the anti-choice movement, but the fight for women\u2019s reproductive rights is nonnegotiable,\u201d Chinogwenya said.",
      "However, agencies that rely heavily or entirely on U.S funding might have little choice but \u201cto quiet their guidelines on access to abortion\u201d to qualify for funding, said Denise Horn, an international relations and civil society expert at Bryant University in Rhode Island.",
      "In South Africa, where abortion is mostly legal, some NGOs, especially those without alternative funding, stopped openly discussing abortion as an option or changed their guidelines and the information they share publicly, according to an assessment by South Africa\u2019s Rhodes University and the International Women\u2019s Health Coalition, a New York-based NGO.",
      "\u201cOrganizations thus have to evaluate what is most important: the non-abortion work they will still be able to do or the principle of pro-choice,\u201d read part of the 2019 assessment report. \u201cUltimately, these organizations will have to make this difficult decision.\u201d",
      "The long lines of women at the outreach clinic in Zimbabwe\u2019s Epworth settlement underline the dire need for family planning services in impoverished communities.",
      "Engeline Mukanya, 30, said she is already struggling to support her three children with the $100 she earns monthly from plaiting women\u2019s hair. Nurses inserted a birth-control implant in her left arm to protect her from pregnancy for the next five years.",
      "Like many here, she cannot afford private providers who charge $20 to $60.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate that we are so far away from America yet we are being caught in the crossfire of its politics,\u201d she said. \u201cAll we want is the freedom to space our births.\u201d"

      "At least 36 transgender people have died from violence in the 12 months since the last Day of Remembrance, the Human Rights Campaign said in its annual report. Since 2013, the organization has recorded the deaths from violence of 372 victims who were transgender and gender-expansive \u2014 which refers to someone with a more flexible range of gender identity or expression than typically associated with the binary gender system.",
      "The number of victims is likely higher because many deaths often aren't reported or are misreported, or misgendering of the victims leads to delays in their identification.",
      "The Human Rights Campaign said there was a slight increase from the previous year, when it identified at least 33 transgender victims of violence.",
      "A large number of the victims tracked over the past year were young or people of color, with Black transgender women making up half of the 36 identified. The youngest victim identified was 14-year-old Pauly Likens of Pennsylvania.",
      "Two-thirds of the fatalities involved a firearm, the organization said. Nearly a third of the victims with a known killer were killed by an intimate partner, a friend or a family member.",

      "Insurers selling Medicare Advantage plans are dangling coverage with $0 premiums, and individual insurance marketplaces created through the Affordable Care Act offer tax credits to help with the premium or cost of coverage.",
      "Here are other factors to consider beyond price.",
      "This is the annual amount a patient pays for many covered services before the insurer starts paying a portion of the bill. Plans with low premiums can come with deductibles well over $1,000 for individuals and a few thousand dollars for families.",
      "Shoppers should look at the size of the individual deductible and understand where it applies. Regular visits to a specialist can lead to some hefty patient bills.",
      "Deductibles are different from copayments or copays. Those are flat amounts that a patient pays for a covered service or doctor visit. Copays typically do not count toward paying off a deductible.",
      "Insurers form networks of covered doctors and health systems. Some plans may provide no coverage for care sought outside those networks.",
      "The federal government\u2019s website for finding insurance plans makes it easy to filter for covered doctors and hospitals when looking for plans, said Emily Bremer, president of a St. Louis-based independent insurance agency, The Bremer Group.",
      "Bremer says shoppers should think about more than whether their doctors are in the network. They also should also consider which hospital system they would want to visit if a big emergency happens.",

      "Don\u2019t immediately rule out the plan if the bill would be too high. Help may be available. Drugmakers often have coupons or discount programs that can cover patient costs as long as the drug has coverage, Bremer said. Websites like GoodRx also may be an option for getting a price break.",
      "\u201cIf you take a lot of stuff and see a lot of doctors \u2026 it can be really hard to find one perfect plan that\u2019s going to cover everything,\u201d she said. \u201cSometimes you have to make choices.\u201d",
      "This is the portion of a bill the patient is responsible for after meeting the deductible. It\u2019s a percentage that can vary. Usually plans with lower premiums leave patients with bigger coinsurance.",
      "Coinsurance payments can hurt, so it\u2019s important to know the percentage and the risk you face.",
      "For instance, a childbirth by cesarean section may generate a $25,000 bill. A patient responsible for a $1,000 deductible and then 20% of the remaining bill through coinsurance could pay $5,800 of that total.",

      "Even with litigation pending, Tuesday's measure would move the independent state board to the State Auditor's Office starting next summer. At that time the new auditor \u2014 Republican Dave Boliek, who was elected this month \u2014 would make appointments. These changes likely would mean Republican control of the board.",
      "In a likely response to complaints about slow vote-counting this month, the bill also would require in 2025 that county election boards count all provisional ballots by three days after Election Day.",
      "Some counties did not complete this year's provisional ballot count until days after last Friday's canvassing date. The measure also would move up the deadline by which some people who lack a photo identification card while voting must show they have one for their ballot to count.",
      "GOP Rep. Grey Mills, a House elections committee chairman, said the state auditor is the best place to house the elections board, given that the post is known for conducting investigations and reviews. And the election counting changes will create more efficiency.",
      "\u201cOur voters expect us to be able to provide the election results in a timely fashion,\u201d Mills said. \u201cI truly believe that this language will do this.\u201d",
      "State Board of Elections Executive Director Karen Brinson Bell said that board staff were not consulted about the legislation and it \u201cmay make it impossible for the county boards of elections to adequately ensure every eligible ballot cast is counted, especially in high turnout elections.\u201d",
      "Tuesday\u2019s bill contains additional Helene-related provisions and locates an additional $227 million from the state\u2019s reserves but orders the money to remain unspent for now. It does give $50 million more to help Cooper\u2019s administration address a shortfall to complete housing projects still left over from Hurricane Matthew in 2016 and Hurricane Florence in 2018.",
      "State lawmakers previously set aside over $900 million toward Helene relief and recovery in two measures approved this fall and signed by Cooper. Cooper has asked for legislators to provide much more, and quickly.",
      "Democrats from western North Carolina said Republicans were more interested in power grabs than helping businesses and residents damaged by Helene. Republicans used a procedure by which Democrats could not offer amendments.",
      "\u201cThis bill makes it pretty clear that the body is prioritizing political priorities over the very real need for rapid assistance in the western part of our state,\u201d Buncombe County Rep. Eric Ager said. Three Republicans from the west ended up voting no on the bill \u2014 a development that could scuttle a potential Cooper override.",
      "Rep. Donny Lambeth, a Forsyth County Republican who only handled the spending provisions, said lawmakers are receiving Helene spending requests daily.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of work still that needs to be done ... and still, quite frankly, a lot of money that\u2019s going to have to be spent,\u201d Lambeth said.",
      "The legislation also would immediately weaken the governor's authority to fill vacancies on the state Court of Appeals and Supreme Court by limiting choices to three candidates offered by the political party of the outgoing justice or judge.",
      "Stein, who is currently attorney general, is being succeeded by fellow Democrat Jeff Jackson. The bill would limit the attorney general in part by barring him in litigation that challenges a law's validity from taking legal positions contrary to the General Assembly.

      "The Republican attempt to erode Democrats' powers recalls similar measures passed in late 2016 that were designed to weaken Cooper, who was about to succeed Republican Gov. Pat McCrory. Those bills led to loud demonstrations in the Legislative Building and dozens of arrests.",

      "The emergencies began two days after Raynaldo Rivera Ortiz Jr. was notified of a disciplinary inquiry into an incident during which he allegedly \u201cdeviated from the standard of care\u201d during an anesthesia procedure when a patient experienced a medical emergency.",
      "Ortiz, who had a history of disciplinary actions against him, complained to other physicians that the center was trying to \u201ccrucify\u201d him.",

      "An attorney listed in court documents for Ortiz did not immediately return a phone call for comment.",
      "Prosecutors said numerous patients at Surgicare North Dallas suffered cardiac emergencies during routine medical procedures performed by various doctors from May through August in 2022. Another anesthesiologist who had worked there died while treating herself for dehydration using an IV bag from the facility, prosecutors said.",
      "The surgical center staff concluded that these cases suggested a pattern of intentional adulteration of IV bags used at the center.",
      "They identified 10 additional unexpected cardiac emergencies that occurred during otherwise unremarkable surgeries in the months before his arrest, which was an exceptionally high rate of complications over such a short period, according to the complaint.",

      "Husain, who was born in Pakistan and later lived in Tanzania, Thailand and the Philippines, said her international background was in keeping with Borlaug's work and the foundation's efforts to expand its efforts in Africa, Asia and other parts of the world. She has worked at the foundation for 16 years.",
      "\u201cI grew up all over the world and many of these places are places where Normal Borlaug spent a lot of his time, so I feel a deep connection to him,\u201d Husain said in an interview. \u201cHaving lived all over the world, I've witnessed poverty and hunger. I've been surrounded by it since I was a little girl.\u201d",
      "As part of an effort to expand its efforts in other countries, the foundation has created a new chief executive position. The new hire will, among other duties, enhance connections with international leaders in agriculture, food security, nutrition and sustainable development.",

      "Here's a look at a television doctor who became a politician and is now designated to lead an agency that touches nearly all Americans in some way.",
      "Trained as a heart surgeon, Oz rose to prominence on Oprah Winfrey's leading daytime television show before spinning off his own series, \u201cThe Dr. Oz Show,\" in 2009.",
      "The program aired for 13 seasons and made Oz a household name.",
      "Oz stopped doing surgeries in 2018 but his physician license remains active in Pennsylvania through the end of this year, according to the state's online database.",

      "He attended a private high school in Delaware and Harvard University as a college undergraduate, also playing football there, and served in the Turkish army to maintain his dual citizenship.",
      "Oz dispensed nutritional and lifestyle advice on his show, portraying himself as a trusted doctor capable of explaining health matters in an engaging and approachable way. But his show also blurred the line between medical advice and advertising, failing to make clear to his audience just how closely he worked with the companies he pitched.",
      "He repeatedly promoted products of questionable medical value and was named in lawsuits that alleged he made misleading claims on the show.

      "Oz told The Associated Press in a 2022 interview that he first met Trump in 2004 or 2005 when he asked Trump to use his golf course for an event for Oz\u2019s children\u2019s charity. Trump agreed. After that, they saw each other intermittently at social events before Oz interviewed Trump about his health during the 2016 presidential campaign.",
      "In a 2016 appearance on \u201cThe Dr. Oz Show,\u201d Trump said his wife, Melania Trump, was \u201ca big fan\u201d of the show.",

      "Since 2022, Teton County District Judge Melissa Owens has ruled consistently three times to block the laws while they were disputed in court.",
      "The decision marks another victory for abortion rights advocates after voters in seven states passed measures in support of access.",
      "One Wyoming law that Owens said violated women's rights under the state constitution bans abortion except to protect to a pregnant woman's life or in cases involving rape and incest. The other made Wyoming the only state to explicitly ban abortion pills, though other states have instituted de facto bans on the medication by broadly prohibiting abortion.",
      "The laws were challenged by four women, including two obstetricians, and two nonprofit organizations. One of the groups, Wellspring Health Access, opened as the state\u2019s first full-service abortion clinic in years in April 2023 following an arson attack in 2022.",
      "\u201cThis is a wonderful day for the citizens of Wyoming \u2014 and women everywhere who should have control over their own bodies,\" Wellspring Health Access President Julie Burkhart said in a statement.",
      "The recent elections saw voters in Missouri clear the way to undo one of the nation\u2019s most restrictive abortion bans in a series of victories for abortion rights advocates. Florida, Nebraska and South Dakota, meanwhile, defeated similar constitutional amendments, leaving bans in place.",
      "Abortion rights amendments also passed in Arizona, Colorado, Maryland and Montana. Nevada voters also approved an amendment in support of abortion rights, but they\u2019ll need to pass it again it 2026 for it to take effect. Another that bans discrimination on the basis of \u201cpregnancy outcomes\u201d prevailed in New York.",
      "The abortion landscape underwent a seismic shift in 2022 when the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, a ruling that ended a nationwide right to abortion and cleared the way for bans to take effect in most Republican-controlled states.",
      "Currently, 13 states are enforcing bans on abortion at all stages of pregnancy, with limited exceptions, and four have bans that kick in at or about six weeks into pregnancy \u2014 often before women realize they\u2019re pregnant.",
      "Nearly every ban has been challenged with a lawsuit. Courts have blocked enforcement of some restrictions, including bans throughout pregnancy in Utah and Wyoming. Judges struck down bans in Georgia and North Dakota in September 2024. Georgia\u2019s Supreme Court ruled the next month that the ban there can be enforced while it considers the case.",
      "In the Wyoming case, the women and nonprofits who challenged the laws argued that the bans stood to harm their health, well-being and livelihoods, claims disputed by attorneys for the state. They also argued the bans violated a 2012 state constitutional amendment saying competent Wyoming residents have a right to make their own health care decisions.",
      "As she had done with previous rulings, Owens found merit in both arguments. The abortion bans \u201cwill undermine the integrity of the medical profession by hamstringing the ability of physicians to provide evidence-based medicine to their patients,\u201d Owens ruled.",
      "The abortion laws impede the fundamental right of women to make health care decisions for an entire class of people \u2014 those who are pregnant \u2014 in violation of the constitutional amendment, Owens ruled.",
      "Wyoming voters approved the amendment amid fears of government overreach following approval of the federal Affordable Care Act and its initial requirements for people to have health insurance.",
      "Attorneys for the state argued that health care, under the amendment, didn\u2019t include abortion. Republican Gov. Mark Gordon, whose administration has defended the laws passed in 2022 and 2023, did not immediately return an email message Monday seeking comment.",
      "Both sides wanted Owens to rule on the lawsuit challenging the abortion bans rather than allow it to go to trial in the spring. A three-day bench trial before Owens was previously set, but won\u2019t be necessary with this ruling."

      "Turkey Trots have become an enduring Thanksgiving tradition for many experienced runners and novices alike",
      "Thanksgiving morning is often a blur of last-minute meal preparation and frenzied chores. But for Beth Thomas, who typically hosts her family at her Boston-area home, most of the work in the kitchen is already done.",
      "Instead, she laces up her sneakers and warms up for a 5K Turkey Trot run with her two sons.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s just a fun thing for us to do, knowing probably seven hours later, everyone\u2019s going to be passed out on the couch after having overindulged appropriately. It\u2019s a high point for us to be out there,\u201d said Thomas. \u201cWhy not start the day doing something that we really love and then eat a lot of good food later?\u201d",
      "Turkey Trots have become an enduring tradition for many people on and around Thanksgiving. There are thousands of races, ranging from about 1 mile to a full marathon.",
      "Run Signup, a platform where runners can register and fundraise for races, calls Thanksgiving \u201cthe biggest US running day of the year.\u201d More and more people are joining in, it said; 2023 saw the highest number of turkey trotters ever registered on the site, with almost 1 million runners across the country.",
      "Some do it for fitness, others for family and community, and many are also raising money for charities. The races attract both novices and serious runners.",
      "There are also Turkey Trots that go by other names: Gobble Wobbles, Drumstick Dashes and Huffing for Stuffings. While most races are held on Thanksgiving Day, some take place the weekend before or after.",
      "Thomas and her sons have run in Thanksgiving races for several years. Sometimes other relatives join them. Still others cheer them on from the sidelines.",
      "Thanksgiving exercise events are by no means a novel idea. Just ask the 14,000 participants in the upcoming Turkey Trot in Buffalo, New York, which will be the local YMCA\u2019s 129th annual race.",
      "Mike Baggerman, the communications director at the YMCA Buffalo Niagara, said Buffalo\u2019s race \u2014 officially a year older than the Boston Marathon \u2014 has become a hallmark for the community.",
      "While some runners show up for the 8K race with a competitive spirit and achieve record-setting times, the overwhelming majority are \u201cpeople like you and me who just want to have something fun to do on Thanksgiving Day.\u201d",
      "Children and people who use wheelchairs are frequent participants, Baggerman said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s one of the most memorable races,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a fun run.\u201d",
      "Many beginning runners train in the weeks and months leading up to Thanksgiving to compete in a Turkey Trot. Even for those who don\u2019t run regularly, the jolt of activity \u2014 perhaps a mix of walking and running \u2014 can feel good.",
      "Prioritizing exercise and movement during a week when many have long to-do lists and multiple stressors is often difficult, said dietician and Michigan-based fitness instructor Casey Young. To her, Thanksgiving races can not only help people reach their physical activity goals but also help stabilize their mood and reduce stress.",
      "\u201cHolidays tend to be such a stressful time for a lot of people, and sometimes people are traveling, and that can add some additional stress and get you out of your typical routine,\u201d Young said. \u201cSo, anytime we have an opportunity to move our body is a positive thing.\u201d",
      "Exercise may prompt people to be \u201cmore mindful and intentional\u201d when plating up later, Young said, but she warns against the mentality that the purpose of the exertion is to earn a decadent Thanksgiving meal or to burn it off afterward. That could foster an \u201cunhealthy relationship with food.\u201d",
      "Turkey trotters should instead emphasize the physical activity and its health benefits, she said.",
      "Beyond the physical and mental benefits, many turkey trotters lean into the holiday\u2019s spirit of thankfulness and giving back.",
      "Some of the races are organized as fundraisers in partnership with local organizations. Registration fees for participants and donations on their behalf often benefit causes like food banks, homeless shelters and community programs.",
      "Baggerman said the Buffalo Niagara YMCA\u2019s turkey trot is the organization\u2019s largest fundraiser of the year, raising money for affordable childcare, community classes, health and wellness programs, and efforts to combat food insecurity.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s more than just a fun 5-mile run on Thanksgiving Day. It\u2019s something that helps the YMCA achieve its mission, which is to strengthen the western New York community,\u201d he said. \u201cFor Buffalo people to step up every single year and sell this race out at 14,000, it\u2019s a miracle.\u201d"

      "Kansas has promised to provide more hospital beds for mentally ill criminal defendants",
      "TOPEKA, Kan. -- Kansas has promised to provide more hospital beds for mentally ill criminal defendants to settle a federal lawsuit filed over defendants waiting months for evaluations of whether they were fit for a trial.",
      "The agreement between state officials and representatives of five defendants requires the state to \u201cuse its best efforts\u201d to open a new psychiatric hospital by January 2027 in Wichita, the state's largest city. Officials also must seek funding from the Kansas Legislature to reopen a previously closed 30-bed unit at its psychiatric hospital in Larned in western Kansas, about 130 miles (209 kilometers) northwest of Wichita.",
      "The agreement was announced this week by the two groups pursuing the lawsuit, the American Civil Liberties Union of Kansas and the National Police Accountability Project, based in the Seattle area. The groups sued in 2022 on behalf of attorneys for four defendants and the mother of a fifth. The accused were identified only by their initials.",
      "The state operates two psychiatric hospitals, but only the one in Larned has a unit for evaluating whether mentally ill criminal defendants can understand their cases and participate in their own defense. Since the COVID-19 pandemic, Larned State Hospital has had fewer than 80 beds for defendants awaiting evaluation.",
      "The state Department for Aging and Disability Services, which runs the Larned facility, acknowledged before the lawsuit was filed that defendants were waiting an average of about 11 months to be evaluated. The lawsuit said defendants remained in county jails that weren't providing adequate treatment, making the inmates' conditions worse and violating their rights. The lawsuit also said the state was violating the federal Americans with Disabilities Act by discriminating against people with mental health problems.",
      "\u201cThis settlement is more than a legal agreement; it\u2019s a lifeline for those who have been lost in the system, a promise that their dignity and humanity will no longer be ignored,\u201d said Lauren Bonds, the police accountability group's executive director.",
      "One of the five defendants covered by the lawsuit had been held in a county jail for 13 months facing criminal threat charges when the lawsuit was filed. That's longer than the maximum prison sentence for a conviction on that charge.",
      "\u201cRemaining in the jail environment is devastating and deeply harmful even for those whose mental health is not in question, and condemning Kansans to languish across the state in their county jails was contradictory to our values of justice,\" said Monica Bennett, the ACLU of Kansas' legal director.",
      "State officials argued that they already had been addressing the long waits. The state began having Larned State Hospital officials operate a mobile evaluation unit in 2019; and in 2022, the Legislature passed a law to allow other qualified hospitals and organizations to examine criminal defendants.",
      "The state and Wichita's home county hope to start construction early next year on a secure, $101.5 million psychiatric hospital with 104 beds, half of them set aside for the state. Federal COVID-19 relief dollars provided part of the funding.",
      "KDADS spokesperson Cara Sloan-Ramos said the department and Gov. Laura Kelly are committed to reducing wait times.",
      "Republican state Rep. Stephen Owens, chair of the House committee handling criminal justice issues, was pleased that the state could settle the lawsuit.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve certainly been aware of this issue and have been working on solutions,\" Owens said Tuesday."

      "Environmental advocates released reports Friday decrying fossil fuel industry influence at these climate talks in Baku, Azerbaijan, called COP29",
      "BAKU, Azerbaijan -- Good or bad, the United Nations climate negotiations process itself became the focus of the international talks that aim to curb warming from coal, oil and natural gas.",
      "Environmental advocates released reports Friday decrying fossil fuel industry influence at the climate talks called COP29. At the same time, a letter signed by a former United Nations secretary-general and ex-top climate negotiators called for dramatic reform. And the conference's chief negotiator said current talks \u2014 aimed at striking a deal worth hundreds of billions of dollars to help finance a transition to clean energy and adapting to climate change \u2014 were going too slowly.",
      "All that put the focus on process \u2014 not results.",
      "\u201cWe consider COP29 as a litmus test for the global climate architecture,\" conference lead negotiator Yalchin Rafiyev said at a Friday news conference.",
      "A letter signed by former U.N. chief Ban Ki-Moon, former U.N. climate secretary Christiana Figueres and former Ireland President Mary Robinson called for \u201ca fundamental overhaul of the COP.\"",
      "\"We need a shift from negotiation to implementation,\u201d it said.",
      "Two signees \u2014 Figueres and Johan Rockstrom, director of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research \u2014 said the letter was being badly misinterpreted as criticism of the climate talks. They said the letter was intended to show support for the process, which they said has worked and just needs to shift into a new mode.",
      "Instead of spending so much effort negotiating new deals in annual conferences that can attract 70,000 people, the process should be smaller and more frequent and aimed at putting what was already agreed upon into action, Rockstrom said.",
      "\u201cIt's about strengthening the COP,\" Rockstrom said. \u201cIt's about recognizing we\u2019ve accomplished so much that we have what we need. ... We really need to get serious about delivery.\"",
      "Climate Analytics CEO Bill Hare said he had issues with some of the suggestions in the letter and personally considers the COP process broken. His analysis this week showed that after the 2015 Paris agreement projected future warming dropped, but in the past three years, warming projections \u2014 based on negotiations, promises and policies \u2014 for the future have stayed the same or even gone up slightly.",
      "An analysis from the Kick Big Polluters Out coalition said Friday that the official attendance list of the talks featured at least 1,770 people connected to fossil fuel interests.",
      "Catherine Abreu, director of the International Climate Politics Hub, suggested that there should be a \u201cfirewall\u201d between fossil fuel lobbyists, U.N. climate bodies and negotiators from countries. \u201cWe know over 1,700 fossil fuel lobbyists are here at COP29. That is not acceptable,\u201d she said.",
      "Former U.S. Vice President Al Gore, who on Friday presented new data on carbon pollution sites, said \u201cit\u2019s unfortunate that the fossil fuel industry and the petrostates have seized control of the COP process to an unhealthy degree.\"",
      "For his part, COP29 negotiator Rafiyev defended the process.",
      "\u201cThe process has already delivered, the COP process so far by reducing projected warming, delivering finance to those in need,\" Rafiev said. \u201cIt\u2019s better than any alternative.\u201d",
      "One key benefit of the U.N. climate talks process is it's the only place where vulnerable small island nations have an equal seat at the table, United Nations Environment Programme Executive Director Inger Andersen told The Associated Press. But the process has its limits because \u201cthe rules of the game are set by member states,\u201d she said.",
      "At a press conference, Alliance of Small Islands States Chair Cedric Schuster said the negotiating bloc felt the need to remind everyone else why the talks matter.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re here to defend the Paris agreement,\u201d Schuster said, referring to the climate deal in 2015 to limit warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial times. \u201cWe\u2019re concerned that countries are forgetting that protecting the world\u2019s most vulnerable is at the core of this framework.\u201d",
      "Also at the talks Friday, new data from an organization co-founded by Gore that combines observations and artificial intelligence found that cities in Asia and the United States emit the most heat-trapping gas, with Shanghai the most polluting.",
      "Using observations and artificial intelligence, Climate Trace quantifies heat-trapping carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide, as well as other traditional air pollutants worldwide, including for the first time in more than 9,000 urban areas.",
      "Seven states or provinces spew more than 1 billion metric tons of greenhouse gases, all of them in China, except Texas, which ranks sixth.",
      "Earth's total carbon dioxide and methane pollution grew 0.7% to 61.2 billion metric tons with the short-lived but extra potent methane rising 0.2%. The figures are higher than other datasets \u201cbecause we have such comprehensive coverage and we have observed more emissions in more sectors than are typically available,\u201d said Gavin McCormick, Climate Trace's co-founder.",
      "Shanghai's 256 million metric tons of greenhouse gases led all cities and exceeded those from the nations of Colombia or Norway. Tokyo's 250 million metric tons would rank in the top 40 of nations if it were a country, while New York City's 160 million metric tons and Houston's 150 million metric tons would be in the top 50 of countrywide emissions. Seoul, South Korea, ranks fifth among cities at 142 million metric tons.",
      "\u201cOne of the sites in the Permian Basin in Texas is by far the No. 1 worst polluting site in the entire world,\u201d Gore said. \u201cAnd maybe I shouldn\u2019t have been surprised by that, but I think of how dirty some of these sites are in Russia and China and so forth. But Permian Basin is putting them all in the shade.\u201d",
      "China, India, Iran, Indonesia and Russia had the biggest increases in emissions from 2022 to 2023, while Venezuela, Japan, Germany, the United Kingdom and the United States had the biggest decreases in pollution.",
      "The dataset \u2014 maintained by scientists and analysts from various groups \u2014 also looked at traditional pollutants such as carbon monoxide, volatile organic compounds, ammonia, sulfur dioxide and other chemicals associated with dirty air. Burning fossil fuels releases both types of pollution, Gore said.",
      "This \u201crepresents the single biggest health threat facing humanity,\u201d Gore said.",

      "There\u2019s one exercise group that says you really can keep up with outdoor workouts through the winter",
      "The sun had yet to come up in Edmonton, Alberta, and it was more than 20 degrees below zero. Tanis Smith layered up anyway, ready to run up and down hundreds of stairs among the trees in the Saskatchewan River Valley.",
      "When she arrived at 6 a.m., 10 other people joined her. It wouldn\u2019t be the last time they risked freezing their toes off to get in a workout before the rest of the world wakes up.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re pretty much just putting everything you own on,\u201d said Smith, an accountant. \u201cIf you look at the pictures, you don\u2019t know who you are unless you remember what you were wearing.\u201d",
      "Since that winter of 2013, Smith has rarely missed a workout with the group, called November Project, a network of free outdoor group exercise classes that started in Boston. No matter the month or weather, participants roll out of bed before dawn at least once a week and shield their faces from the blistering cold.",
      "One part intense training and one part abject silliness, the project is a model for how to stay motivated to exercise outside throughout the winter.",
      "It started when a pair of friends challenged each other to exercise every morning for the month of November. By the end of the month, they were recruiting others.",
      "\u201cA party is better when there\u2019s more people around,\u201d said Bojan Mandaric, who created the project with Brogan Graham in 2011. \u201cWe would talk to anybody who would listen.\u201d",
      "Soon, their meetings were attracting a few dozen people, who then brought the idea to other cities when they moved. Now there are 52 chapters in eight countries, including 44 in the United States and Canada.",
      "Workouts, which attract all ages and fitness levels, begin with a \u201cbounce,\u201d a hopping, call-and-response chant to loosen people up physically and mentally. How the classes continue varies on the location and day of the week, but most include running and body weight exercises like squats or burpees.",
      "To promote the idea that exercise can be fun, they also might weave in activities that would be at home during childhood recess in the schoolyard.",
      "In Edmonton, they\u2019ve played an intense version of duck duck goose, gone sledding in winter and done Slip \u2019n\u2019 Slide in summer. One workout in Boston involved a kind of Easter egg hunt, where you search for plastic eggs at a sprint. Crack them open to find commands that could be, walk like a gorilla, do a cartwheel, or grab grass and dump it on Mandaric\u2019s head.",
      "The point is to lower inhibitions, which helps people make connections, said Jason Shaw, co-leader of the Indianapolis chapter.",
      "\u201cNobody\u2019s cool at November Project,\u201d he said. \u201cAt different gyms, especially, you always have the people who just are so cool, or think they\u2019re so cool. We try to nip that in the bud.\u201d",
      "Shaw said chapters mark different milestones, much like Scout merit badges, by spray painting a tag on your shirt for, say, showing up on your first single-digit day.",
      "But they don\u2019t spray when it\u2019s too cold. The paint freezes.",
      "If you don\u2019t have a chapter nearby, many cities offer some kind of running or outdoor exercise group, though many are not free. Otherwise, November Project organizers offered a few suggestions on how to stay motived to keep working through the colder months.",
      "Accountability is a core tenet of the project. Members make a verbal promise to show up, and there is almost a sense of letting down your teammates if you don\u2019t, said Mandaric, who moved to Boston from Serbia to row crew for Northeastern University.",
      "There\u2019s no such thing as bad weather, just bad clothing, Shaw said. At a minimum, buy a moisture-wicking base layer that will help keep you warm and dry. Avoid cotton, which keeps sweat in contact with your body and will make you colder. And add a top jacket with wind-breaking fabric.",
      "Commit to exercising on the same days and times for a month. Creating a predictable routine will help you get into a groove that is easier to maintain, Mandaric said.",
      "One of the things Smith appreciates most about the project is its social aspect. She called it \u201ca chosen family\u201d that was formed partly because they were having fun while exercising.",
      "\u201cFitness doesn\u2019t have to be this hard-nosed, drill-sergeant type thing,\u201d she said. \u201cYou can have fun and get fit.\u201d",

    "published": "Wed, 20 Nov 2024 20:34:18 -0500",
    "summary": "About 1,500 migrants have formed a new caravan in southern Mexico, hoping to walk or catch rides to the U.S. border",
    "story": [
      "About 1,500 migrants have formed a new caravan in southern Mexico, hoping to walk or catch rides to the U.S. border",
      "TAPACHULA, Mexico -- About 1,500 migrants formed a new caravan Wednesday in southern Mexico, hoping to walk or catch rides to the U.S. border. The migrants are mainly from Central and South America. Some say they are hoping to reach the United States before Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration in January, saying they think it might be more difficult after that. They started out walking from the city of Tapachula, near the border with Guatemala, where thousands of migrants are stranded because they do not have permission to cross further into Mexico.",
      "Migrant caravans began forming in 2018, and they became a final, desperate hope for poorer migrants who do not have the money to pay smugglers. If migrants try to cross Mexico alone or in small groups, they are often either detained by authorities and sent back to southern Mexico, or worse, deported back to their home countries. In that sense, there is safety in numbers: it is hard or impossible for immigration agents to detain groups of hundreds of migrants. So police and immigration agents often try to pick off smaller groups, and wait for the main body of the caravan to tire itself out. Usually the caravans stop or fall apart within 150 miles (250 kilometers).",
      "There is no safety in numbers, however, against threats, extortion or abduction by drug cartels in Mexico, which have become heavily involved in migrant trafficking. The cartels charge migrants or their smugglers for permission to cross their territories along the border. In addition, the gangs often kidnap migrants, hold them in terrible conditions or torture them until they call relatives to send money for their release. The biggest obstacle, though, is the searing heat, dehydration and distance: it is over 1,100 miles (1,780 kilometers) from Tapachula to the nearest border crossing at Matamoros, across from Brownsville, Texas. And that is the shortest, but also one of the most dangerous routes. It would mean 16 days of straight walking even for an adult with no rest stops; many of the migrants come with their children.",
      "Since migrants usually cannot find work to support themselves in Tapachula, most of the foreigners trapped there are desperate to leave. Some feel a sense of urgency, hoping to reach the border before Trump's Jan. 20 inauguration.",
      "\u201cIt is going to be more difficult, that's why we are going in hopes of getting an appointment quicker so we are able to cross before he (Trump) takes office,\u201d said Yotzeli Pe\u00f1a, 23, a migrant from Venezuela. \u201cThat would be easier.\u201d",
      "This year, in a bid to stop people from gathering at the border to claim asylum, the U.S. government expanded areas where migrants can apply online for appointments to enter the United States to a large swath of southern Mexico.",
      "The CBP One cellphone app was instituted to make asylum claims more orderly. About 1,450 appointments are made available daily, encouraging migrants to get an appointment before they show up at the border. But the service was only available in northern and central Mexico.",
      "By extending the app south to Tapachula, officials hoped it would stem the rush north. But some migrants still want to be close to the border so that if they do get one of the cherished appointments, they can get to it quickly and not risk missing it. Trump has promised to end the app, reduce legal pathways to the U.S. and organize mass deportations.",
      "The biggest caravans formed in 2018 and 2019, and back then Mexican officials helped out some of the migrants by arranging buses to border cities, but that created a backlash in those communities. Groups from those original caravans did eventually reach the border.",
      "In caravans since then, most participants have sought out as many hitch-hiking or paid rides as they can, and often swarm empty trucks to hitch a ride on empty freight platforms. But that has become much harder as Mexican authorities discouraged buses, taxis and trucks from stopping to pick up migrants. In recent years, authorities have eventually offered temporary transit permits to dissolve the caravans."

      "Iraq has begun its first nationwide population census in decades in a step aimed at modernizing data collection and planning in a country long impacted by conflict and political divisions",
      "BAGHDAD -- Iraq began its first nationwide population census in decades Wednesday, a step aimed at modernizing data collection and planning in a country long impacted by conflict and political divisions.",
      "The act of counting the population is also contentious. The census is expected to have profound implications for Iraq\u2019s resource distribution, budget allocations and development planning.",
      "Minority groups fear that a documented decline in their numbers will bring decreased political influence and fewer economic benefits in the country\u2019s sectarian power-sharing system.",
      "The count in territories such as Kirkuk, Diyala and Mosul -- where control is disputed between the central government in Baghdad and the semi-autonomous Kurdish regional government in the north -- has drawn intense scrutiny.",
      "Ali Arian Saleh, the executive director of the census at the Ministry of Planning, said agreements on how to conduct the count in the disputed areas were reached in meetings involving Iraq\u2019s prime minister, president and senior officials from the Kurdish region.",
      "\u201cResearchers from all major ethnic groups \u2014 Kurds, Arabs, Turkmen, and Christians \u2014 will conduct the census in these areas to ensure fairness,\u201d he said.",
      "The last nationwide census in Iraq was held in 1987. Another one held in 1997 excluded the Kurdish region.",
      "The new census \u201ccharts a developmental map for the future and sends a message of stability,\u201d Planning Minister Mohammed Tamim said in a televised address.",
      "The census will be the first to employ advanced technologies for gathering and analyzing data, providing a comprehensive picture of Iraq\u2019s demographic, social, and economic landscape, offiials say. Some 120,000 census workers will survey households across the country, covering approximately 160 housing units each over two days.",
      "The Interior Ministry announced a nationwide curfew during the census period, restricting movement of citizens, vehicles and trains between cities, districts and rural areas, with exceptions for humanitarian cases.",
      "Shops were closed in Baghdad on Wednesday and streets were empty except for checkpoints set up to enforce the curfew. In some neighborhoods, people sat in chairs on the sidewalks drinking tea and talking to the census workers.",
      "Among them was Aqeel Al-Rubaie, a father of three who provided his information to the workers.",
      "\u201cThe census is important, but I do not trust politicians,\u201d he said. \u201cThey may exploit the census for political conflict.\u201d",
      "Census worker Ali Amer, wearing a brown jacket with the logo of the Ministry of Planning, said people asked him, \u201cWill the census cause us harm? And what kind of harm?\u201d He said he tried to reassure them.",
      "The count will be carried out using the \u201cde jure\u201d method, in which people are counted in their usual area of residence, Saleh said.",
      "That means that people internally displaced by years of war will be counted in the areas where they have since settled, not in their original communities. The census will not include Iraqis residing abroad or those forcibly displaced to other countries.",
      "Saleh estimated Iraq\u2019s population at 44.5 million and said the Kurdish region\u2019s share of the national budget \u2014 currently 12% \u2014 is based on an estimated population of 6 million. The census will also clarify the number of public employees in the region.",
      "By order of Iraq\u2019s federal court, the census excluded questions about ethnicity and sectarian affiliation, focusing solely on broad religious categories such as Muslim and Christian.",
      "\u201cThis approach is intended to prevent tensions and ensure the census serves developmental rather than divisive goals,\u201d Saleh said. The census will be monitored by international observers who will travel across Iraq\u2019s provinces to assess the data quality, he said.",
      "Hogr Chato, director of the Irbil-based Public Aid Organization, said the census will reshape the map of political thinking and future decision making.",
      "\u201cEven though some leaders deny it, the data will inevitably have political and economic implications,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s also fair to allocate budgets based on population numbers, as areas with larger populations or those impacted by war need more resources.\u201d",
      "Chato said he believes the delays in conducting the census were not only due to security concerns but also political considerations. \u201cThere was data they didn\u2019t want to make public, such as poverty levels in each governorate,\u201d he said.",
      "Ahead of the census, leaders in Iraq\u2019s various communities urged people to be counted.",
      "In Baghdad\u2019s Adhamiyah district, Abdul Wahhab al-Samarrai, preacher at Imam Abu Hanifa Mosque, urged citizens to cooperate with the census.",
      "\u201cThis is a duty for every Muslim to ensure the rights of future generations,\u201d he said in a Friday sermon the week before the count.",

      "Pope Francis has revised the funeral rites that will be used when he dies",
      "ROME -- Pope Francis has revised the funeral rites that will be used when he dies, simplifying the rituals to emphasize his role as a mere bishop and allowing for burial outside the Vatican in keeping with his wishes.",
      "The Vatican newspaper L\u2019Osservatore Romano on Wednesday published details of the updated liturgical book, which Francis approved April 29 and which replaces the previous edition that was last published in 2000.",
      "Francis turns 88 in December and, despite some health and mobility problems, appears in fine form. On Wednesday, he presided over a spirited general audience that featured children who spontaneously rushed the stage.",
      "While popes often tinker with the rules regulating the conclave that will elect their successor, a revision of the papal funeral rites became seemingly necessary after Emeritus Pope Benedict XVI died on Dec. 31, 2022.",
      "The Vatican had to work out a funeral for the first retired pope in 600 years, and a few months later Francis revealed he was working with the Vatican\u2019s master of liturgical ceremonies, Monsignor Diego Ravelli, to overhaul the papal funeral rites to simplify them.",
      "In that 2023 interview with Mexican Televisa broadcaster N+, Francis also revealed that he had decided he would be buried in Santa Maria Maggiore basilica in Rome, not in the grottoes underneath St. Peter\u2019s Basilica where most popes are buried.",
      "Ravelli said the new reform simplifies the funeral rites, including eliminating the requirement that the pope be placed on an elevated bier in St. Peter\u2019s Basilica for public viewing. Rather, he will be on view in a simple coffin, and the burial no longer requires the traditional three coffins made of cypress, lead and oak.",
      "The simplification, Ravelli was quoted as saying, is meant \u201cto emphasize even more that the Roman Pontiff\u2019s funeral is that of a shepherd and disciple of Christ and not of a powerful man of this world.\u201d",
      "Since his 2013 election, Francis has eschewed the pomp often associated with the papacy to emphasize his role as the bishop of Rome and a servant of the \u201cchurch of the poor.\u201d The Argentine Jesuit lives in the Vatican hotel, not the Apostolic Palace, and travels in small Fords or Fiats, not fancy SUVs.",
      "His desire to be buried at Santa Maria Maggiore reflects his veneration of an icon of the Virgin Mary that is located there, the Salus populi Romani (Salvation of the people of Rome).",
      "After every trip, Francis goes to the basilica to pray before the Byzantine-style painting that features an image of Mary, draped in a blue robe, holding the infant Jesus who in turn holds a jeweled golden book.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s my great devotion,\u201d Francis told N+ in revealing his future burial plans. \u201cThe place is already prepared.\u201d",

      "The policy will take effect next May and aims to expand the country's aging workforce. Spain has remained largely open to receiving migrants even as other European nations seek to tighten their borders to illegal crossings and asylum seekers.",
      "Spain needs around 250,000 registered foreign workers a year to maintain its welfare state, Migration Minister Elma Saiz said in an interview on Wednesday. She contended that the legalization policy is not aimed solely at \u201ccultural wealth and respect for human rights, it\u2019s also prosperity.\u201d",

      "Ford said Wednesday most of the job cuts would come in Germany and would be carried out in consultation with employee representatives.",
      "Of the total, 2,900 jobs would be lost in Germany, 800 in Britain and 300 in other European Union countries. Ford has 28,000 employees in Europe, and 174,000 worldwide.",
      "\u201cThe global auto industry continues to be in a period of significant disruption as it shifts to electrified mobility,\u201d the company said in a statement. \u201cThe transformation is particularly intense in Europe where automakers face significant competitive and economic headwinds while also tackling a misalignment between CO2 regulations and consumer demand for electrified vehicles,\u201d the statement said.",
      "In Europe, automakers must sell enough electric vehicles to meet new, lower limits for fleet average carbon dioxide emissions in 2025, and face a longer term 2035 EU goal of reducing emissions to zero, which would mean the elimination of most vehicles with internal combustion engines.",
      "EV sales however have lagged as consumers weary of inflation have held back on spending and after major car market Germany dropped government purchase incentives for EVs. Electric vehicles sales fell by 5.8% in the first nine months of the year in an overall shrinking market for cars. Carmakers are also facing increasing competition from Chinese-made electric vehicles.",
      "The company said that it would also reduce working time for workers at its Cologne, Germany, plant where it makes the Capri and Explorer electric vehicles.",
      "Ford sales fell 15.3% in the first nine months of the year compared to the same period last year, according to the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association. The company's market share shrank to 3% from 3.5% The Dearborn, Michigan, headquartered automaker saw companywide net profit fall by 26% to $892 million in the third quarter as it took $1 billion in accounting charges to write down assets for a canceled three-row electric SUV. The company cited higher warranty and other costs.",
      "Ford is an established brand in Europe and will mark its 100th anniversary of doing business in Germany next year. Its main plant in Cologne started production in 1931; the groundbreaking was attended by Henry Ford and then-Mayor Konrad Adenauer, later Germany\u2019s chancellor.",
      "Ford is not alone in suffering from headwinds. Volkswagen has said it is contemplating closing as many as three of its German plants, according to its chief employee representative. European Automobile Manufacturers\u2019 Association has called for a speedier review of lower C02 limits slated for 2026.",
      "Ford said company vice chairman and CFO John Lawler had written a letter to the German government reiterating Ford's commitment to climate goals but urging action to improve market conditions and ensuring the industry\u2019s future success.",
      "\"What we lack in Europe and Germany is an unmistakable, clear policy agenda to advance e-mobility, such as public investments in charging infrastructure, meaningful incentives to help consumers make the shift to electrified vehicles, improving cost competitiveness for manufacturers, and greater flexibility in meeting CO2 compliance targets,\u201d Lawler said."

      "The U.S. defense chief says the Biden administration will give Ukraine antipersonnel land mines to help it slow Russia\u2019s battlefield advances",
      "KYIV, Ukraine -- The Biden administration announced Wednesday that it will give Ukraine antipersonnel mines to help it slow Russia\u2019s battlefield advances, marking the second major shift on U.S. military support for Kyiv in days.",
      "After allowing Ukraine to use longer-range American missiles to launch strikes deeper into Russia, U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said the shift in Washington\u2019s policy on antipersonnel land mines for Ukraine was needed to counter changing Russian tactics.",
      "The war, which reached its 1,000-day milestone on Tuesday, has largely been going Russia\u2019s way. Moscow's bigger army is slowly pushing Ukraine\u2019s forces backward in the eastern Donetsk region, while Ukrainian civilians are being maimed and killed by Russian drones and missiles often fired from inside Russia.",
      "Individual ground troops, rather than forces more protected in armored carriers, are leading the Russian battlefield advance, so Ukraine has \u201ca need for things that can help slow down that effort,\u201d Austin said during a trip to Laos.",
      "The announcement comes two months before Donald Trump replaces Joe Biden in the White House. Trump has pledged to swiftly end the war and has criticized the amount the U.S. has spent on supporting Ukraine.",
      "Biden administration officials say they are determined to help Ukraine as much as possible before he leaves office, and they announced Wednesday that the U.S. intends to cancel half of the debt \u2014 some $4.6 billion \u2014 Ukraine owes to the country. State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said U.S. lawmakers were informed of the move this week, and that he doesn't expect them to pass a resolution of disapproval to try to stop the loan forgiveness because of the bipartisan support for Ukraine in the current Congress.",
      "The steps taken to help Ukraine \u2014 along with unconfirmed reports Wednesday of Ukraine firing a certain British cruise missile at Russia for the first time \u2014 were likely to vex Moscow.",
      "The U.S. and some other Western embassies in Kyiv temporarily closed on Wednesday in response to the threat of a potentially major Russian aerial attack on the Ukrainian capital.",
      "Humanitarian groups have long criticized the use of antipersonnel mines because they present a lingering threat to civilians. Amnesty International called the U.S. decision \u201creckless\u201d and a \u201cdeeply disappointing setback.\" And Norway\u2019s foreign minister, Espen Barth Eide, called it \u201cvery problematic\u201d because Ukraine is a signatory to an international convention opposing the use of land mines.",
      "Austin pointed out that Ukraine already makes its own antipersonnel mines, and that the U.S. has been providing Ukraine with anti-tank mines. He also tried to allay concerns about the new mines the U.S. is giving Kyiv, saying they are not persistent, meaning troops can control when they would self-detonate.",
      "\u201cThat makes it far more safer eventually than the things that they are creating on their own,\u201d Austin said.",
      "The mines are are electrically fused and powered by batteries so that when the battery runs out, they won\u2019t detonate. They can become inert in anywhere from four hours to two weeks.",
      "Russia already uses land mines in Ukraine, but those don\u2019t become inert over time.",
      "The United States also sought commitments from the Ukrainians on the use of the mines to limit harm to innocent civilians, according to a U.S. official who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations. Ukraine would use the mines in its own country and would not put them in civilian populated areas.",
      "The mines are contained in a $275 million package of new military assistance announced by the Biden administration Wednesday. Also included in the package are High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems, or HIMARS, as well as 155 mm and 105 mm artillery rounds, Javelin anti-armor munitions, and other equipment and spare parts.",
      "The war has taken on a growing international dimension with the arrival of North Korean troops to help Russia on the battlefield \u2014 a development that U.S. officials said prompted Biden\u2019s policy shift on allowing Ukraine to fire longer-range U.S. missiles into Russia and that angered the Kremlin.",
      "Britain had been quietly pressing the U.S. to ease restrictions on how Western-supplied missiles are used, and unconfirmed news reports Wednesday said Ukraine had fired British-made Storm Shadow cruise missiles at Russia for the first time. British and Ukrainian officials didn't confirm the reports.",
      "Officials with France's military and president\u2019s office, meanwhile, declined to say whether Ukraine is using French long-range SCALP missiles to strike targets in Russia, citing France's military secrecy policy. French President Emmanuel Macron has been pushing for such a step for months.",
      "After the Biden administration allowed Ukraine to attack Russia with longer-range American-made ATACMS missiles, Russian President Vladimir Putin lowered the threshold for using his nuclear arsenal, with the new doctrine announced Tuesday permitting a potential nuclear response by Moscow even to a conventional attack on Russia by any nation that is supported by a nuclear power.",
      "That could potentially include Ukrainian attacks backed by the U.S.",
      "The American diplomatic mission in Kyiv said Wednesday that it had received a warning about a potentially significant Russian air attack on the Ukrainian capital and closed the embassy for several hours before reopening. The Spanish, Italian and Greek embassies also closed, but the U.K. government and France said that their embassies remained open.",
      "Western leaders dismissed the Russian reaction to the U.S. missile decision as an attempt to deter Ukraine\u2019s allies from providing further support to Kyiv, but the escalating tension weighed on stock markets after Ukraine fired ATACMS missiles for the first time at a target inside Russia.",
      "Western and Ukrainian officials say Russia been stockpiling powerful long-range missiles, possibly in an upcoming effort to crush the Ukrainian power grid as winter approaches.",
      "Military analysts say the U.S. decision on the range over which American-made missiles can be used isn't expected to be a game-changer, but it could help weaken the Russian war effort, according to the Institute for the Study of War, a Washington think tank.",
      "\u201cUkrainian long-range strikes against military objects within Russia\u2019s rear are crucial for degrading Russian military capabilities throughout the theater,\" it said.",
      "Meanwhile, North Korea recently supplied additional artillery systems to Russia, according to South Korea. It said that North Korean soldiers were assigned to Russia\u2019s marine and airborne forces units and some of them have already begun fighting alongside the Russians on the front lines.",
      "Ukraine struck a factory in Russia\u2019s Belgorod region that makes cargo drones for the armed forces in an overnight attack, according to Andrii Kovalenko, the head of the counter-disinformation branch of Ukraine\u2019s Security Council.",
      "He also claimed Ukraine hit an arsenal in Russia\u2019s Novgorod region, near the town of Kotovo, located about 680 kilometers (420 miles) behind the Ukrainian border. The arsenal stored artillery ammunition and various types of missiles, he said.",

    "story": [
      "Legislation for the world's first legal ban on children under 16 using social media has been introduced in Australia's Parliament",
      "MELBOURNE, Australia -- Australia\u2019s communications minister introduced a world-first law into Parliament on Thursday that would ban children under 16 from social media, saying online safety was one of parents\u2019 toughest challenges.",
      "Michelle Rowland said TikTok, Facebook, Snapchat, Reddit, X and Instagram were among the platforms that would face fines of up to 50 million Australian dollars ($33 million) for systemic failures to prevent young children from holding accounts.",
      "\u201cThis bill seeks to set a new normative value in society that accessing social media is not the defining feature of growing up in Australia,\u201d Rowland told Parliament.",
      "\u201cThere is wide acknowledgement that something must be done in the immediate term to help prevent young teens and children from being exposed to streams of content unfiltered and infinite,\u201d she added.",
      "X owner Elon Musk warned that Australia intended to go further, posting on his platform: \u201cSeems like a backdoor way to control access to the Internet by all Australians.\u201d",
      "The bill has wide political support. After it becomes law, the platforms would have one year to work out how to implement the age restriction.",
      "\u201cFor too many young Australians, social media can be harmful,\" Rowland said. \"Almost two-thirds of 14- to 17-years-old Australians have viewed extremely harmful content online including drug abuse, suicide or self-harm as well as violent material. One quarter have been exposed to content promoting unsafe eating habits.\u201d",
      "Government research found that 95% of Australian care-givers find online safety to be one of their \"toughest parenting challenges,\u201d she said. Social media had a social responsibility and could do better in addressing harms on their platforms, she added.",
      "\u201cThis is about protecting young people, not punishing or isolating them, and letting parents know that we\u2019re in their corner when it comes to supporting their children\u2019s health and wellbeing,\u201d Rowland said.",
      "Child welfare and internet experts have raised concerns about the ban, including isolating 14- and 15-year-olds from their already established online social networks.",
      "Rowland said there would not be age restrictions placed on messaging services, online games or platforms that substantially support the health and education of users.",
      "\u201cWe are not saying risks don\u2019t exist on messaging apps or online gaming. While users can still be exposed to harmful content by other users, they do not face the same algorithmic curation of content and psychological manipulation to encourage near-endless engagement,\u201d she said.",
      "The government announced last week that a consortium led by British company Age Check Certification Scheme has been contracted to examine various technologies to estimate and verify ages.",
      "In addition to removing children under 16 from social media, Australia is also looking for ways to prevent children under 18 from accessing online pornography, a government statement said.",
      "Age Check Certification Scheme\u2019s chief executive Tony Allen said Monday the technologies being considered included age estimation and age inference. Inference involves establishing a series of facts about individuals that point to them being at least a certain age.",
      "Rowland said the platforms would also face fines of up to AU$50 million ($33 million) if they misused personal information of users gained for age-assurance purposes.",
      "Information used for age assurances must be destroyed after serving that purpose unless the user consents to it being kept, she said.",
      "Digital Industry Group Inc., an advocate for the digital industry in Australia, said with Parliament expected to vote on the bill next week, there might not be time for \u201cmeaningful consultation on the details of the globally unprecedented legislation.\u201d",
      "\"Mainstream digital platforms have strict measures in place to keep young people safe, and a ban could push young people on to darker, less safe online spaces that don't have safety guardrails,\" DIGI managing director Sunita Bose said in a statement. \u201cA blunt ban doesn't encourage companies to continually improve safety because the focus is on keeping teenagers off the service, rather than keeping them safe when they're on it.\u201d"

      "But Tuesday, President Milei found himself at the Group of 20 summit in Rio de Janeiro shaking hands with Chinese President Xi Jinping and vowing to boost trade with the Asian powerhouse, a day after his economy minister signed a preliminary agreement to export Argentine natural gas to Brazil.",
      "Milei even acquiesced to a joint declaration endorsed by world leaders late Monday despite his earlier attempts to play spoiler to the G20 host, Brazil\u2019s left-wing president Luiz In\u00e1cio \u201cLula\u201d da Silva who was once called by Milei a \u201ccorrupt communist.\"",
      "The final moments of the summit revealed Milei's more pragmatic streak, coming as a surprise after the irascible president sought to undercut various international initiatives \u2014 withdrawing Argentine negotiators from the U.N. climate summit, casting the only \u201cno\u201d votes on two U.N. resolutions, one supporting Indigenous rights and another advocating for an end to violence against women, and roiling negotiations at the G20 summit.",
      "Argentina has also dramatically reshaped its foreign policy in line with its hard-right allies in Italy \u2014 with Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni headed to Buenos Aires on Tuesday to spend more time with Milei \u2014 and in Israel.",
      "On Tuesday, Andrea Tenenti, a spokesperson for the U.N. peacekeeping mission operating along Lebanon's southern border, told reporters in Geneva that Argentina had decided to withdraw its peacekeepers from the force, known as UNIFIL.",
      "He did not say why, but Israel has repeatedly requested that peacekeepers leave the area since the military's Oct. 1 invasion of southern Lebanon. Despite Israeli attacks on peacekeepers, UNIFIL has vowed to stay put and none of the other 47 troop-contributing countries has pulled out.",
      "In the past few days, Argentine resistance to the joint G20 communiqu\u00e9 focused on clauses related to the taxation of the super-rich and regulation of online speech, diplomats said. Argentine delegates also sought to block language about gender equality and references to the U.N. 2030 agenda on sustainable development, which Milei has decried as socialist.",
      "Critics in Rio saw the Argentine president as a saboteur. Supporters back home cheered Milei as a leader of the \u201cnew world disorder.\u201d Fresh off a trip to Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida where he ranted against socialism and rubbed shoulders with the president-elect and tech billionaire Elon Musk, Milei initially seemed immune to such concerns in Rio.",
      "Milei's office issued a harsh statement citing his objections to the G20 declaration. But the president ultimately signed onto it under enormous international pressure.",
      "\u201cArgentina is not a great power and it is in a very difficult situation economically,\" said Roberto Goulart Menezes, a professor of international relations at the University of Brasilia. That pressure, he added, was \u201cenough for Argentina to finally reduce its opposition.\u201d",
      "During Milei's first-ever meeting with Xi on Tuesday, the leaders discussed their \u201ccurrent trade and financial ties\" and \u201cdesire to continue exploring new opportunities to expand and improve,\u201d the Argentine presidency said in a statement, along with a photo of the presidents sharing a warm handshake. It said the leaders had invited each other to visit.",
      "With Argentina highly reliant on China as a market for its soybeans and other crops, the cordial tone made clear that the crisis-stricken South American nation has no desire for relations with its second-largest trading partner and crucial source of financing to further deteriorate.",
      "A statement from China's foreign ministry said Xi expressed his appreciation for Milei's \u201cwillingness to continue deepening bilateral cooperation.\"",
      "China has maintained strategic assets in Argentina, including stakes in lithium mines and a space station in Patagonia. Earlier this year, former Foreign Minister Diana Mondino, whom Milei recently fired, led a successful visit to China to patch up relations strained by Milei's colorful insults (\"Would you trade with an assassin?\" he asked on the campaign trail last August, accusing China of killing dissidents).",
      "After Mondino's trip, Beijing in June resumed a currency swap deal worth billions of dollars that boosted Argentina\u2019s depleted reserves.",
      "On Monday, as negotiations over the G20 draft grew increasingly tense, Argentine Economy Minister Luis Caputo and Brazilian Energy Minister Alexandre Silveira signed a memorandum of understanding that offered a new and important source of income to cash-strapped Argentina.",
      "The agreement to work toward shipping 30 million cubic meters of natural gas to Brazil from Argentina\u2019s Vaca Muerta, a vast shale oil and gas field in Patagonia, over the next five years, \u201cmight have helped\u201d Milei sign the joint G20 statement, Silveira told reporters.",
      "But it did nothing to dispel the chill between the leaders of South America's largest economies, who have opposite views on climate change, social issues and the role of governments.",
      "A set of official photographs that splashed across the front pages of local newspapers Tuesday showed Lula and other government leaders clasping hands amicably in sharp contrast to the Brazilian leader's photo-op with Milei \u2014 both men standing stiffly apart despite protocol demanding they shake hands, looking like they\u2019d rather be anywhere else in the world.",
      "Some fear that Trump's election has further emboldened Milei and other far-right political figures to abandon U.N. commitments and ambitious multilateral agreements on issues like climate change.",
      "\u201cMilei has already taken a pro-Trump stance, thinking ... that the G20 could be emptied by President Trump,\" said Goulart Menezes, the international relations expert.",
      "Yet, he cautioned that \u201cmaking Argentina\u2019s foreign policy conditional on the future president of the United States\u201d carries risks.",

      "South Korea's spy agency says that North Korea has recently supplied additional artillery systems to Russia to support its war efforts against Ukraine",
      "SEOUL, South Korea -- North Korea recently supplied additional artillery systems to Russia to support its war efforts against Ukraine, while some of the thousands of North Korean troops deployed in Russia have begun engaging in combat, South Korea\u2019s spy agency told lawmakers Wednesday.",
      "The South Korean assessment came after Russia warned Monday that U.S. President Joe Biden\u2019s decision to let Ukraine strike targets inside Russia with U.S.-supplied longer-range missiles adds \u201cfuel to the fire\u201d of the war. U.S. officials said Biden\u2019s decision was triggered almost entirely by North Korea\u2019s entry into the war.",
      "In a closed-door briefing at parliament, the National Intelligence Service said that North Korea exported 170mm self-propelled guns and 240mm multiple rocket launch systems to Russia, according to lawmaker Lee Seong Kweun, who attended the meeting.",
      "Lee told reporters that the NIS assessed those weapons are a type of artillery the Russian military doesn\u2019t operate so North Korea likely dispatched personnel to teach the Russians how to use them and handle their maintenance.",
      "Last week, Russian Telegram channels and other social media posts published photos apparently showing North Korean\u2019s \u201cKoksan\u201d 170mm self-propelled guns being moved by rail inside Russia. The Financial Times, citing Ukrainian intelligence assessments, reported Sunday that North Korea in recent weeks sent some 50 domestically produced 170mm self-propelled howitzers and 20 240mm multiple launch rocket systems to Russia.",
      "The artillery systems are the latest conventional weapons that North Korea is believed to have provided to Russia as the two countries are sharply expanding their military cooperation in the face of separate confrontations with the U.S. and its allies. Last month, the NIS said that North Korea had sent more than 13,000 containers of artillery, missiles and other conventional arms to Russia since August 2023 to replenish its dwindling weapons stockpiles.",
      "During its Wednesday briefing, the NIS said that an estimated 11,000 North Korean soldiers in late October were moved to Russia\u2019s Kursk region, where Ukrainian troops seized parts of its territory this year, following their training in Russia's northeast, Lee said. He cited the NIS as saying the North Korean soldiers were assigned to Russia\u2019s marine and airborne forces units and some of them have already begun fighting alongside the Russians on the frontlines.",
      "The U.S., Ukraine and others have similar estimates on the size of North Korea's troop deployment. They say the North Korean soldiers arrived in Russia in October and that some of them have since engaged in combat in the Kursk region. Observers say North Korea's participation in the almost 3-year war threatens to escalate the conflict.",
      "Park Sunwon, another lawmaker who was present at the NIS meeting, made similar comments on the briefing. He said the spy agency couldn\u2019t provide an assessment on possible North Korean casualties.",
      "Moscow said Tuesday that Ukraine fired six U.S.-made ATACMS missiles at Russia\u2019s Bryansk region, in what would be Kyiv\u2019s first use of the weapon inside Russia. Ukraine\u2019s General Staff did not confirm whether the weapon was used, but said the armed forces struck an ammunition warehouse in the Bryansk region, which neighbors Kursk and was likely supplying Russian forces fighting there.",
      "Since the first year of the war, Ukrainian leaders have lobbied Western allies to allow them to use advanced weapons to strike key targets inside Russia.",

      "Pakistan and Afghanistan are the only two countries in the world where the spread of polio has never been stopped.",
      "The sudden rise in cases of polio, which is an infection caused by a virus that mostly affects children under 5, has hampered the country's yearslong efforts to make it a polio-free state.",
      "The latest case was detected in Tank, a district in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province where militants often target polio workers and police assigned for anti-polio campaigns, according to a statement by the National Emergency Operations Centre for Polio Eradication. Pakistan has reported 50 such cases this year, it said.",
      "Most polio cases this year were reported in the restive southwestern Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa provinces bordering Afghanistan, where 23 confirmed cases have surfaced, according to data from the World Health Organization. That\u2019s up from six cases in 2023.",
      "Hamid Jafari, the WHO director for the Eastern Mediterranean, said last week the forced repatriation of Afghans from Pakistan was a major setback to polio eradication and has led to a \u201cmassive and unpredictable movement\u201d of people within the two countries and across borders.",

      "Japanese officials say they are closely watching to see if China keeps its promise to prevent further violations of Japan\u2019s airspace after explaining that an incursion by a Chinese military aircraft nearly three months ago was unintentional and caused ...",
      "TOKYO -- Japanese officials said Wednesday they are closely watching to see if China keeps its promise to prevent further violations of Japan's airspace after explaining that an incursion by a Chinese military aircraft nearly three months ago was unintentional and caused by turbulence.",
      "Tokyo protested and sought an explanation from Beijing after a Chinese Y-9 reconnaissance plane briefly entered Japanese airspace off the southern main island of Kyushu on Aug. 26, prompting Japan's military to scramble fighter jets and warn the plane.",
      "Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi said China acknowledged the airspace violation and assured Japan that it would make efforts to prevent a recurrence.",
      "\u201cWe take note of China's explanation, and we will closely watch Chinese military activity from now on,\u201d Hayashi said.",
      "China said the airspace violation occurred when the plane's pilot took emergency measures in response to turbulence in the area and was not intentional, Japan's Foreign Ministry said. Japanese officials did not disclose further details, such as when China provided the explanation, citing the protocol of diplomatic exchanges.",
      "Even though aircraft can encounter turbulence, such a significant deviation from a flight route is unthinkable, Japanese officials said.",
      "NHK public television reported that Japanese defense officials said they still find the airspace violation unacceptable because it was a serious breach of territorial sovereignty.",
      "In Bejing, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian did not confirm what Japanese officials said they were told. He said only the diplomatic and defense ministries of the two countries have been communicating on the issue and that \u201cChina has no intention of intruding into the airspace of any country.\u201d",
      "Japanese officials are concerned about China's growing military activity around Japan's southwestern waters and airspace. It has led Tokyo to significantly reinforce its defenses in the area, which includes remote islands that are considered key to Japan's defense strategy.",
      "Japan is also worried about joint military activities between China and Russia.",
      "A Chinese survey ship violated Japanese territorial waters off a southern island in August. In September, the Chinese aircraft carrier Liaoning and two destroyers sailed between Japan\u2019s westernmost island of Yonaguni \u2014 just east of Taiwan \u2014 and nearby Iriomote, entering Japan's \u201ccontiguous zone,\u201d an area just outside of a country\u2019s territorial waters in which it can still exercise some control over maritime traffic.",

      "Russia\u2019s top domestic security agency says it arrested a German national it accused of planning to sabotage energy facilities on orders from a Ukrainian national",
      "MOSCOW -- Russia's top domestic security agency on Wednesday reported arresting a German national it accused of planning to sabotage energy facilities on orders from a Ukrainian national.",
      "The Federal Security Service, known as the FSB, said in a statement carried by Russian news agencies that it detained German national Nikolai Gayduk as he entered Russia's westernmost exclave of Kaliningrad from Poland and seized half a liter (one pint) of liquid explosives from his car.",
      "It didn\u2019t say whether Gayduk also had Russian citizenship or a visa to enter the country.",
      "The FSB accused Gayduk, a resident of Hamburg born in 1967, of planning acts of sabotage on orders from a Ukrainian, Alexander Zhorov, who also lives in Hamburg.",
      "The agency said Gayduk was involved in an explosion at a gas distribution station in Kaliningrad in March, and that a criminal case was brought against him on charges of a terrorist attack and smuggling of explosives. A court ordered Gayduk to be placed in pretrial detention pending an investigation, Russian news agency Interfax reported. No other details were provided.",
      "The German Foreign Ministry said it was aware of the case. Spokesperson Kathrin Deschauer said the arrest took place in October, and that the German Consulate in St. Petersburg was informed. She wouldn\u2019t give further details, citing privacy rules.",
      "Deschauer said the consulate has offered consular support to the detainee and is in contact with Russian authorities regarding that.",
      "German officials had no comment on the Russian claims that the detainee had been given orders by a Ukrainian living in Hamburg.",
      "Deschauer noted that, in general terms, there is an \u201catmosphere of intimidation and fear\u201d in Russia that \u2014 as Germany\u2019s travel advice notes \u2014 can lead to arbitrary arrests of foreigners.",

    "story": [
      "South African authorities are embroiled in a standoff with an unconfirmed number of illegal miners who remain underground at an abandoned mine, apparently fearing arrest by police officers at the site",
      "JOHANNESBURG -- South African authorities are embroiled in a standoff with an unconfirmed number of illegal miners who remain underground at an abandoned mine, apparently fearing arrest by police officers deployed at the site.",
      "The miners in Stilfontein, in the country\u2019s North West province, have been entering the mine, which is no longer in operation, searching for gold deposits. Such illegal mining has long been going on across South Africa.",
      "The standoff in Stilfontein \u2014 now in its third week \u2014 has highlighted the extent of illegal mining in the country.",
      "Police initially prevented basic supplies from getting to the miners but are now sending them packets of instant porridge and trying to get them to come up to the surface.",
      "Here's what to know about the standoff:",
      "Illegal mining has been underway for decades, on the back of the country's once booming mining industry.",
      "The illegal miners \u2014 known as zama-zamas or \"hustlers\u201d in the Zulu language \u2014 search for gold and other precious metal deposits at old and abandoned mines that have been closed or where mining has been halted.",
      "Police consider the illegal miners dangerous because they are usually armed and are known to fight violent turf battles among themselves. The trade is believed to be dominated by migrants who enter the country illegally from neighboring Lesotho, Zimbabwe and Mozambique.",
      "Police have at times announced successes in arresting the illegal miners but they say they cannot combat the practice unless powerful kingpins who run lucrative syndicates from the trade are apprehended.",
      "The government estimates that there are about 6,000 unused or abandoned mines in South Africa and that close to $1 billion is lost annually in revenue due to illegal mining.",
      "Since last December, police, government agencies and the military have joined forces in an operation dubbed \u201cClose the Hole\u201d or \u201cVala Umgodi\u201d in Zulu \u2014 basically trying to starve the illegal miners underground by denying them basic supplies.",
      "Working in groups, zama-zamas typically remain in the mines for extended periods of time, relying on those on the surface to provide them with food, water, cigarettes and other items.",
      "But since the operation began, police have arrested the on-the-ground accomplices and those trying to take supplies to the illegal miners. They have also closed entrances on the ground for taking supplies down. The tactic seems to be trying to force the miners to the surface as their supplies run out.",
      "Police say that so far, 14,000 illegal miners have been arrested and that $277 000 in cash and $1.8 million worth of uncut diamonds have been seized.",
      "Earlier this month, 565 illegal miners were arrested at an abandoned mine in Orkney, in the same North West province as Stilfontein, when they resurfaced after running out of supplies.",
      "Members of the Stilfontein local community first tried to bring the illegal miners out but then authorities took over.",
      "The mine is 2,500 meters (8,000 feet) deep and getting the zama-zamas, many of them likely armed, out by force would be risky.",
      "Three illegal miners have reportedly come out and last Thursday, a decomposed body believed to be of one of the miners was brought to the surface. Police said they are still trying to determine the person\u2019s identity and cause of death.",
      "Initial estimates, based on information from community members who tried to mediate, say there are about 4,500 illegal miners underground but police have since suggested the number is more likely between 350 and 400.",
      "Provincial authorities this week said plans include sending a \u201ccage\u201d down the mine to lift the miners \u2014 a few at a time \u2014 to the surface, but the safety of such an operation would need to be assessed first.",
      "The government team is also considering sending a camera down to have a visual idea of the situation underground.",
      "A civil society group has gone to court to try and force authorities to allow that supplies be sent to the miners. The government argues they are not trapped but refusing to come out to avoid arrest."

      "European Union lawmakers have rubber-stamped a new team of policy commissioners for the next five years to head one of the bloc's most rightward-leaning executive branches ever",
      "BRUSSELS -- BRUSSELS (AP) \u2014 European Union lawmakers on Wednesday ended a week of bickering to rubber-stamp a new team of policy commissioners that will head one of the most rightward-leaning executive branches ever chosen in the bloc for the next five years.",
      "The main centrist pro-European political groups in the European Parliament set aside their political differences to seal a deal on the remaining top posts, declaring in a statement that they were \u201cdetermined to work together to strengthen the European Union.\u201d",
      "Since Nov. 4, senior lawmakers have been vetting the 26 nominees to the European Commission to see whether they\u2019re suitable to lead on policies like trade, agriculture or foreign policy under the stewardship of President Ursula von der Leyen.",
      "The commission is the only EU body with the power to draft laws which, once passed by the European Parliament and the 27 member countries, are applied across much of Europe. They cover everything from water quality to data protection to competition or migration policy.",
      "The approval paves the way for all EU lawmakers to take part in an official vote on the entire commission at a plenary session in Strasbourg, France next week, which should be a formality. It means that von der Leyen\u2019s new team could start work as soon as Dec. 1.",
      "EU-wide elections in June left most centrist and pro-European parties weakened, while the hard right consolidated its position. But the European People\u2019s Party \u2013 a pan-European conservative political family \u2013 remained the biggest group in the assembly.",
      "This has allowed the EPP, which counts von der Leyen as a member, to operate without its usual mainstream political allies, the center-left Socialists and Democrats, the pro-business Renew group, and the environment-friendly Greens.",
      "More than half of the members of the new commission \u2013 candidates are put forward by the 27 national governments \u2013 come from the EPP, and the conservatives have been able to pick and choose their allies to secure agreements. Only four commissioners hail from parties left of center.",
      "Breaking with long tradition, the EPP joined forces with hard-right parties like Italian Premier Giorgia Meloni\u2019s Brothers of Italy, which has neo-fascist roots, and Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n\u2019s nationalist Fidesz to force through the schedule for hearing the commissioners.",
      "But the EPP, socialists and liberals, which together hold a parliamentary majority, said Monday evening that the solutions to Europe's problems \u201cwill come from the cooperation of our political groups and all those who want to continue building a Union based on these values and are ready to address global challenges while upholding democratic institutions.\u201d",
      "Still, Meloni\u2019s nominee, Raffaele Fitto, has secured an executive vice president post \u2014 a first for a hard-right politician \u2014 to oversee a \u201ccohesion policy,\u201d which helps finance infrastructure projects with a big slice of the EU\u2019s massive budget.",
      "Orb\u00e1n\u2019s man, the current enlargement commissioner Oliv\u00e9r V\u00e1rhelyi, was approved for the health and animal welfare portfolio but some of his duties, most notably on sexual and reproductive health rights, were set to be transferred to another commissioner.",
      "The liberals welcomed that news, posting on X that \u201cwith a revised portfolio for V\u00e1rhelyi, Fidesz loses influence over women\u2019s rights.\u201d Hungary has been criticized in Europe in recent years for rolling back marriage, gender and other rights.",
      "Last week, the socialists had accused the EPP leadership of \u201cirresponsible behavior\u201d by working with the Spanish populist party Vox to accuse its nominee for the top climate and competition post, Teresa Ribera, of failing to do enough to prevent the catastrophic floods in eastern Spain. But she too was confirmed.",

      "Lai, founder of the now-shuttered Apple Daily pro-democracy newspaper, was arrested in 2020 in the crackdown that followed the protests. He is accused of colluding with foreign forces to endanger national security and conspiring with others to issue seditious publications. If convicted, he faces up to life in prison.",
      "He testified about his meetings with former U.S. officials and gave details about his alleged political connections with people in the U.S., Britain and Taiwan, including Taiwan ex-President Tsai Ing-wen and Hong Kong\u2019s last British governor, Chris Patten.",

      "Lai said Tsai wanted to know more about the thinking of then President Donald Trump's administration, and knew he was \u201csupportive of Trump.\" She thought he was familiar with the U.S. because of his links with U.S. think tanks. But he never communicated with Trump, he said.",
      "He said he wanted to help Taiwan to know how to better deal with the U.S., because the island was the only democracy of Chinese people.",

      "Former Hong Kong publisher Jimmy Lai is testifying in his defense at his landmark national security trial",
      "HONG KONG -- Former Hong Kong publisher Jimmy Lai denied in his landmark national security trial on Wednesday he had asked then U.S. Vice President Mike Pence and then Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to take action against the city and China during the territory's anti-government protests in 2019.",
      "Lai, founder of the now-shuttered Apple Daily pro-democracy newspaper, was arrested in 2020 in the crackdown that followed the protests. He is accused of colluding with foreign forces to endanger national security and conspiring with others to issue seditious publications. If convicted, he faces up to life in prison.",
      "He testified about his meetings with former U.S. officials and gave details about his alleged political connections with people in the U.S., Britain and Taiwan, including Taiwan ex-President Tsai Ing-wen and Hong Kong\u2019s last British governor, Chris Patten.",
      "The media tycoon, who also describes himself as a businessman and social activist, said he never tried to influence foreign policy on Hong Kong or China through the people he met overseas or ask them to take action against them.",
      "Lai\u2019s case is widely seen as a measure of media freedom and judicial independence in the Asian financial hub.",
      "Lai testified in English that he asked Pence to voice his support for Hong Kong during a 2019 visit to the U.S. But he said he did not ask the U.S. government to take any action, saying, \u201cIt\u2019s beyond me.\u201d",
      "During the same trip Lai also met with Pompeo and had a similar discussion about the situation in Hong Kong, he said.",
      "When Lai\u2019s lawyer, Steven Kwan, asked him whether he had requested the U.S. to do something at that meeting, Lai said \u201cnot to do something but to say something. To voice out its support for Hong Kong.\u201d",
      "Beijing promised to retain the former British colony\u2019s civil liberties for 50 years when it returned to Chinese rule in 1997. But critics say that promise has become threadbare under the rubric of maintaining national security.",
      "Authorities have used a Beijing-imposed national security law to prosecute many of Hong Kong\u2019s leading activists, including Lai and 45 democracy advocates who were sentenced to four to 10 years in prison on Tuesday. Other pro-democracy figures were forced into self-exile or silenced. Dozens of civil society groups have disbanded under the threat of the law.",
      "Beijing and Hong Kong governments insist that the law restored stability to the city following the 2019 protests.",
      "Prosecutors alleged that Lai asked foreign countries, especially the United States, to take actions against Beijing \u201cunder the guise of fighting for freedom and democracy.\u201d",
      "They pointed to Lai\u2019s meetings with Pence, Pompeo and U.S. senators in July 2019 to discuss a now-withdrawn extradition bill that sparked the anti-government protests. They allege that Lai sought support from the U.S. in sanctioning mainland Chinese and Hong Kong leaders who cracked down on the movement.",
      "Dozens of people stood in the rain to secure a seat in the courtroom, including former Apple Daily reader William Wong, who said he wanted to remind Lai that Hong Kongers have not forgotten him.",
      "\u201cI haven\u2019t seen him for a few months. I know he will testify himself, so I want to encourage him,\u201d said Wong, 64.",
      "Upon entering the court, Lai waved and smiled at his family members, who sat next to the city\u2019s Roman Catholic Cardinal Joseph Zen.",
      "During the hearing, Lai said that he had introduced former U.S. officials Paul Wolfowitz and Jack Keane to Tsai, whom he called a friend.",
      "Lai said Tsai wanted to know more about the thinking of then President Donald Trump's administration, and knew he was \u201csupportive of Trump.\" She thought he was familiar with the U.S. because of his links with U.S. think tanks. But he never communicated with Trump, he said.",
      "He said he wanted to help Taiwan to know how to better deal with the U.S., because the island was the only democracy of Chinese people.",
      "But Lai rejected the idea of Hong Kong independence, saying it was a \u201ccrazy\u201d idea and he never allowed his staff or the newspaper to mention it.",
      "He said he broke into the media world \u201cto participate in delivering freedom.\"",
      "\u201cThe more you know, the more you are free,\u201d he said, adding that the core values of Apple Daily were the core values of the people of Hong Kong, including the rule of law, freedom and the pursuit of democracy",
      "In May 2020, a month before the security law took effect, Lai took up the role of executive chairman of Next Digital, the parent company of Apple Daily.",
      "The trial will continue on Thursday.",
      "The U.S. and U.K. governments and independent U.N. human rights experts have called for Lai\u2019s release.",
      "Asked before his reelection this month whether he would talk to Chinese President Xi Jinping to seek Lai\u2019s release, Trump said: \u201c100%, I will get him out.\u201d",
      "Hong Kong leader John Lee said that mutual respect is important for the development of trade relations and there should be no interference in local affairs.",
      "U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer also raised concerns over Lai\u2019s detention to Xi in a meeting during the Group of 20 summit in Brazil.",

    "story": [
      "Inflation in the U.K. has risen sharply to a six-month high in October, cementing market expectations that there will be no further cuts in borrowing rates this year",
      "LONDON -- Inflation in the U.K. rose sharply to a six-month high in October and back above the rate targeted by rate-setters at the Bank of England, official figures showed Wednesday, cementing market expectations that there will be no further cuts in borrowing costs this year.",
      "The Office for National Statistics said higher domestic energy bills pushed up consumer price inflation up to 2.3% in the year to October from the three-year low of 1.7% recorded the previous month. Stubbornly high inflation in the services sector, which accounts for around 80% of the British economy, didn't help either.",
      "The increase, which was above forecasts for a more modest increase, took inflation above the bank's target rate of 2%.",
      "Earlier this month, the bank decreased its main interest rate by a quarter of a percentage point to 4.75% \u2014 the second in three months \u2014 after inflation fell to its lowest level since April 2021.",
      "However, Bank Gov. Andrew Bailey cautioned that rates wouldn't be falling too fast over the coming months, partly because last month's budget measures from the new Labour government would likely see prices rise by more than they would otherwise have done. Rate-setters will meet once more this year, on Dec. 19, by which time they will be armed with more monthly inflation readings.",
      "Central banks worldwide dramatically increased borrowing costs from near zero during the coronavirus pandemic when prices started to shoot up, first as a result of supply chain issues and then because of Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine which pushed up energy costs.",
      "As inflation rates have fallen from multidecade highs, the central banks have started cutting interest rates, though few, if any, economists think that rates will fall back to the super-low levels that persisted in the years after the global financial crisis of 2008-9.",
      "Recent developments have scaled back expectations of rapid cuts from the Bank of England.",
      "In her budget, British Treasury chief Rachel Reeves announced around 70 billion pounds ($90 billion) of extra spending, funded through increased business taxes and borrowing. Economists think that the splurge, coupled with the prospect of businesses cushioning the tax hikes by raising prices, could push inflation higher than it otherwise would have been.",
      "The global inflation outlook has also become more uncertain since Donald Trump was reelected U.S. president. He has indicated that he will cut taxes and introduce tariffs on certain imported goods when he returns to the White House in January. Both policies have the potential to be inflationary both in the U.S. and globally, and thereby keeping interest rates higher than they otherwise would have been.",
      "\u201cWhile we think the Bank of England will continue to cut rates in 2025, the pace of rate cuts is expected to be slower than previously anticipated, and rates may stay elevated for longer,\u201d said Monica George Michail, an economist at the National Institute for Economic and Social Research, a think tank that now reckons inflation will push above 3% in early 2025.",
      "\u201cThis outlook reflects forecasted inflationary pressures stemming from the recently announced budget, in addition to heightened global uncertainty, particularly surrounding the Trump presidency,\u201d she added."

    "story": [
      "Residents of the Hawaii town devastated by last year's wildfire are awaiting the return of one of the nation's most prestigious basketball tournaments with mixed feelings",
      "HONOLULU -- Three generations of TJ Rickard\u2019s family lost their homes in the deadly Maui wildfire more than a year ago, and he and his extended family still have not rebuilt. That leaves Rickard, a high school basketball coach, conflicted about next week's return of the storied Maui Invitational college tournament.",
      "Like many, Rickard is excited to have top-drawer basketball played in Lahaina\u2019s humble arena, but he worries people will think it's business as usual in his hometown. In truth, he says, Lahaina is still struggling after the fire killed at least 102 people and leveled thousands of homes.",
      "\u201cNot even a minute drive away from where they play, there\u2019s houses that are burned down that are still waiting to be rebuilt,\u201d said Rickard, the boys head coach at Lahainaluna High School.",
      "Many residents are excited about the local exposure to high-caliber competition and the economic boost the Maui Invitational will bring. But there\u2019s also a fear that travelers might show disrespect by wandering into the Lahaina burn zone and taking photos of the devastation, or trigger unpleasant memories with questions about that catastrophic day.",
      "\u201cPeople are in a weird state right now over here because there\u2019s so much displacement and loss of community,\u201d said Jon Conrad, Lahainaluna's athletic director. \u201cIt\u2019s a highly sensitive and slightly charged environment.\u201d",
      "Boosters coming to Lahaina should know \u201cit\u2019s been a year and more, but things are still a little raw,\" Conrad said.",
      "The Maui Invitational will bring eight of the NCAA\u2019s best men\u2019s teams \u2014 including two-time defending champion UConn \u2014 to Lahaina\u2019s 2,400-seat gymnasium for three days.",
      "Last year, organizers moved the tournament to Honolulu instead of intruding on Lahaina when many survivors were still living in hotels and charred rubble littered properties. This year, they decided to bring the 40-year-old event back after meeting with the governor's office, the Hawaii Tourism Authority and Maui's mayor, said Tom Valdiserri, executive vice president of KemperSports LIVE.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s our home and we want to be there. And Maui is our ohana, frankly,\u201d Valdiserri said, using the Hawaiian word for family.",
      "Reconstruction is progressing slowly. The Army Corps of Engineers has fully cleared all residential lots and 91% of commercial lots of fire debris. Maui County has issued 133 building permits after receiving 291 applications. One property has been finished.",
      "Rickard\u2019s experience shows how challenging housing is even 15 months after the fire. The blaze burned down his grandparents' house and the in-law unit on their property where Rickard lived with his wife and dog. His parents\u2019 house a few lots away got torched. The blaze claimed a cousin's house across the street and another cousin's place the next street over. A great-aunt who lived down the road lost her house, too.",
      "Rickard now lives in an apartment a 45-minute drive away that's paid for by the Federal Emergency Management Agency. His relatives are living with friends or other family.",
      "Maui officials hope the tournament will help rebuild the tourism industry, which took a massive hit. In 2022, the last year the Maui Invitational was held in Lahaina, the competition brought 6,500 visitors and $24 million in spending to Maui, KemperSports LIVE said.",
      "University of Hawaii researchers said last month that fewer than half of those who had full-time jobs in Lahaina's tourism industry still do. Those with jobs are working fewer hours, their report said.",
      "Rebuilding helps Javier Barberi cope with the disaster. His company, Hana Hou Hospitality, reopened a popular beachfront restaurant that was spared by the flames \u2014 Mala Ocean Tavern \u2014 eight months after the fire. He and his partners overhauled another restaurant and launched it as a new establishment called Coco Deck. To him, the tournament's return is a sign of hope.",
      "\u201cLike, hey, we used to have this. It was gone. Now it\u2019s back,\" Barberi said. \"That restaurant was gone. Now it\u2019s back. That house was gone, now it\u2019s being rebuilt. To see these things happen, it starts to bring things back to normal and bring Maui back.\u201d",
      "Jason Donez, general manager of Leilani's restaurant, remembers his daughter Lola meeting Mike Krzyzewski, Duke's head coach at the time, at a free-throw contest in 2018. The Hall of Fame coach told the 12-year-old she had a nice shot, she should stick with it and he would see her in college one day, Donez said.",
      "Today, Lola Donez is a freshman guard at Cal.",
      "Being around the teams helped her \u201cdream big,\u201d her father said.",
      "Tickets to the games this year range from $56 to $236 depending on the game and seat location, but local residents get about a 28% discount. Tournament organizers and teams will hold basketball clinics for local students.",
      "Organizers have reminded participating schools and their teams to be respectful, and the tournament website has the same message for fans. The athletes and their coaches say they understand.",
      "\u201cI think that\u2019s where you try to remind guys that we\u2019re very fortunate to be able to travel and do the things the way we do, and we\u2019re going to a community that had a huge devastation that none of us would want anyone go to through,\u201d said North Carolina assistant coach Sean May. \u201cSo we\u2019ve got to have some compassion.\"",
      "\"But I think at the end, they\u2019re happy we\u2019re there, we\u2019re happy to be there, it\u2019s great for the community. And to me, it brings so much excitement.\u201d",

      "Target has reported sluggish sales and slumping profits in the fiscal third quarter as inflation-weary customers curtailed their spending on apparel and other non-essential items",
      "NEW YORK -- Target on Wednesday reported sluggish sales and slumping profits in the fiscal third quarter as inflation-weary customers curtailed their spending on apparel and other non-essential items.",
      "The Minneapolis retailer fell short of Wall Street expectations for the quarter, and its profit and sales outlook for the final three months of the year also disappointed industry analysts. Costs related to a U.S. dockworkers\u2019 strike in October also dragged on Target's results at a time when Americans are spending more selectively, the company said.",
      "\u201cWe encountered some unique challenges and cost pressures that impacted our bottom-line performance,\u201d Target Chairman and CEO Brian Cornell said.",
      "The weak August through October period at Target stood in stark contrast to the third quarter of low-price rival Walmart, which reported another quarter of stellar sales Tuesday and released optimistic projections for the holiday season.",
      "Target's outlook was particularly concerning because the discount merchandiser reduced prices on more than 2,000 products for the holidays and rolled out a Thanksgiving dinner deal that put the cost of the holiday meal below last year's total.",
      "Target\u2019s shares plummeted Wednesday, ending down more than 21%. Walmart's share rose nearly 3% after posting its results Tuesday.",
      "The disappointing quarter at Target may have reflected the financial circumstances and mood of U.S. consumers in the months before Election Day. Even as the overall inflation rate came down, voters told pollsters they were unhappy with the state of the economy when the costs of housing, food and other essentials remained so high compared to before the coronavirus pandemic.",
      "Customers are \u201cbeing very patient, shopping for promos, looking for great value on those essential items that they need for their pantry,\u201d Cornell told reporters on Tuesday. \u201cAnd they\u2019re shopping very conservatively and have been in discretionary categories throughout the year.\u201d",
      "That consumer sentiment wasn't aligned in Target\u2019s favor. Groceries account for about 60% of Walmart\u2019s U.S. business, according to the Arkansas-based company\u2019s most recent annual report. Target is more reliant on discretionary items like clothing and accessories because less than a quarter of its sales come from food and beverages.",
      "\u201cAll these things undermine the Target model, which partly relies on a robust consumer who is comfortable loading their cart with things that they want but do not absolutely need,\u201d Neil Saunders, managing director of research firm GlobalData, said.",
      "Walmart\u2019s size also makes it difficult for its competitor to prevail on price. Walmart operates nearly 5,000 stores in the U.S. and generated annual sales of $611.3 billion in the year ended Jan. 31, 2024. In contrast, Target operates 1,900 stores and generated sales of $107.4 billion in the latest fiscal year.",
      "And even if Target has prices that are lower than or equal to Walmart's on some items, it has always battled a perception of being more expensive, Saunders said.",
      "Their marketing slogans reinforce that perception: Target's is \u201cExpect More. Pay Less.\u201d Walmart's is \u201cEvery Day Low Prices.\u201d",
      "Target recorded its lackluster quarterly sales even as it has moved aggressively to cut prices. For the summer, it lowered prices on thousands of necessities ranging from diapers to milk. By the end of December, the company said it will have reduced the prices of over 10,000 items during the year.",
      "Analysts also say that Target has faced stiffer competition from Walmart when it comes to discretionary items like home goods and apparel. Over the past few years, Walmart has added mannequins in its fashion departments and spruced up its fashion selection with more stylish items.",
      "While Target has refreshed its food offerings, Walmart recently launched Bettergoods, its biggest store-label food brand in 20 years in terms of the breadth of items, seeking to appeal to younger customers who are not loyal to grocery brands and want chef-inspired foods that are more affordably priced. The colorfully packaged products include pistachio nut butter and smokey vanilla ground coffee.",
      "Walmart said it's been gaining market share, especially among households with incomes over $100,000. Walmart's online shopping services, which included curbside order pickups, and its paid membership shipping program, Walmart +, also have helped attract wealthier customers.",
      "In response, Target has tried to step up its game. In April, it unveiled a paid membership program called Target Circle 360, which comes with unlimited free same-day delivery for orders over $35 and free two-day shipping for all orders.",
      "Saunders noted that Target has also struggled with operational issues.",
      "Target, like other retailers, had to reroute some merchandise when 45,000 dockworkers went on strike for the first time since 1977. For Walmart, the walkout seemed to cause a hiccup. But the strike took a toll on Target's profits as it struggled with inventory buildup in its warehouses.",
      "Target posted net income of $854 million, or $1.85 per share, in the quarter ended Nov. 2, far short of the $2.30 analysts were looking for, according to FactSet, and down from $971 million, or $2.10 per share, in the year-ago period.",
      "Sales rose to $25.67 billion, up from $25.4 billion last year, but fell shy of Wall Street expectations.",
      "Target said that it now expects its earnings per share to be in the range of $1.85 to $2.45 for its fiscal fourth quarter. That\u2019s below the $2.65 per share expected by analysts polled by FactSet.",
      "The retailer reported that its comparable sales \u2014 those from stores and digital channels operating for at least 12 months \u2014 rose 0.3% during the third quarter. That\u2019s below the 2% gain posted in the second quarter. The increase in the April-June period reversed months of declines, including a 3.7% drop in the first quarter and a 4.4% decline during the company\u2019s final quarter of 2023.",
      "There were some bright spots. Target said quarterly customer traffic increased 2.4%. Target executives said that translates to 10 million more sales transactions from a year ago. Digital comparable sales also increased 10.8%, reflecting a 20% increase in same-day delivery.",
      "President-elect Donald Trump's campaign promises to impose sweeping tariffs on imports from other countries will create challenges for Target and other retailers. Retailers have warned they would be forced to pass the costs of higher tariffs on to shoppers.",
      "\u201cRight now, there\u2019s a lot of uncertainty as to what will happen, and we\u2019ll use our agility to adjust accordingly, \u201d Cornell told reporters Tuesday."

      "The announcement offered no recommendation or decision about how to divvy up water from the river, which provides electricity to millions of homes and businesses, irrigates vast stretches of desert farmland and reaches kitchen faucets in cities including Denver, Salt Lake City, Albuquerque, Las Vegas, Phoenix and Los Angeles.",
      "Instead it provided a bullet-point sample of elements from competing proposals submitted last March by three key river stakeholders: Upper Basin states Colorado, Utah, New Mexico and Wyoming, where most of the water originates; Lower Basin states California, Arizona and Nevada, which rely most on water captured by dams at lakes Powell and Mead; and more than two dozen Native American tribes with rights to river water.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re not going to take the any of the proposals,\u201d said Sarah Porter, director of the Kyl Center for Water Policy at Arizona State University. \u201cThe federal government put the components together in a different way ... and modeled them to provide near-maximum flexibility for negotiations to continue.\u201d",
      "One alternative would have the government act to \u201cprotect critical infrastructure\u201d including dams and oversee how much river water is delivered, relying on existing agreements during periods when demand outstrips supply. \u201cBut there would be no new delivery and storage mechanisms,\u201d the announcement said.",
      "A second option would add delivery and storage for Lake Powell and Lake Mead, along with \u201cfederal and non-federal storage\u201d to boost system sustainability and flexibility \u201cthrough a new approach to distributing\u201d water during shortages.",
      "The third, dubbed \u201ccooperative conservation,\u201d cited a proposal from advocates aimed at managing and gauging water releases from Lake Powell amid \u201cshared contributions to sustain system integrity.\"",
      "And a fourth, hybrid proposal includes parts of Upper and Lower Basin and Tribal Nations plans, the announcement said. It would add delivery and storage for Powell and Mead, encourage conservation and agreements for water use among customers and \u201cafford the Tribal and non-Tribal entities the same ability to use these mechanisms.\u201d",
      "The \u201cno action\u201d option does not meet the purpose of study but was included because it is required under the National Environmental Policy Act, the announcement said.",
      "In 2026, legal agreements that apportion the river will expire. That means that amid the effects of climate change and more than 20 years of drought, river stakeholders and the federal government have just months to agree what to do.",
      "\u201cWe still have a pretty wide gap between us,\u201d Tom Buschatzke, Arizona\u2019s main negotiator on the Colorado River, said in a conference call with reporters. He referred to positions of Upper Basin and Lower Basin states. Tribes including the Gila River Indian Community in Arizona have also been flexing their long-held water rights.",
      "Buschatzke said he saw \u201csome really positive elements\u201d in the alternatives but needed time to review them in detail. \u201cI think anything that could be done to move things forward on a faster track is a good thing,\u201d he said.",
      "Democratic U.S. Sen. John Hickenlooper of Colorado said in a statement the alternatives \u201cunderscore how serious a situation we\u2019re facing on the Colorado River.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe only path forward is a collaborative, seven-state plan to solve the Colorado River crisis without taking this to court,\u201d he said. \"Otherwise, we\u2019ll watch the river run dry while we sue each other.\u201d",
      "Wednesday\u2019s announcement came two weeks after Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris lost the election to Republican former President Donald Trump, and two weeks ahead of a key meeting of the involved parties at Colorado River Water Users Association meetings in Las Vegas.",
      "Kyle Roerink, executive director of the Great Basin Water Network advocacy group, said \u201csnapshots\u201d offered in the announcement \u201cunderscore the uncertainty that is swirling around future river management as a new administration prepares to take office.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe river needs basin-wide curtailments, agreements to make tribes whole, a moratorium on new dams and diversions, commitments for endangered species and new thinking about outdated infrastructure,\u201d he said.",
      "Buschatzke declined to speculate about whether Trump administration officials will pick up where Biden's leaves off. But Porter, at the Kyl Center, said the announcement \u201cshows an expectation of continuity.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe leadership is going to change, but there are a lot of people who have been working on this for a long time who will still be involved in the negotiations and modeling,\u201d she said.",

      "Legislation for the world's first legal ban on children under 16 using social media has been introduced in Australia's Parliament",
      "MELBOURNE, Australia -- Australia\u2019s communications minister introduced a world-first law into Parliament on Thursday that would ban children under 16 from social media, saying online safety was one of parents\u2019 toughest challenges.",
      "Michelle Rowland said TikTok, Facebook, Snapchat, Reddit, X and Instagram were among the platforms that would face fines of up to 50 million Australian dollars ($33 million) for systemic failures to prevent young children from holding accounts.",
      "\u201cThis bill seeks to set a new normative value in society that accessing social media is not the defining feature of growing up in Australia,\u201d Rowland told Parliament.",
      "\u201cThere is wide acknowledgement that something must be done in the immediate term to help prevent young teens and children from being exposed to streams of content unfiltered and infinite,\u201d she added.",
      "X owner Elon Musk warned that Australia intended to go further, posting on his platform: \u201cSeems like a backdoor way to control access to the Internet by all Australians.\u201d",
      "The bill has wide political support. After it becomes law, the platforms would have one year to work out how to implement the age restriction.",
      "\u201cFor too many young Australians, social media can be harmful,\" Rowland said. \"Almost two-thirds of 14- to 17-years-old Australians have viewed extremely harmful content online including drug abuse, suicide or self-harm as well as violent material. One quarter have been exposed to content promoting unsafe eating habits.\u201d",
      "Government research found that 95% of Australian care-givers find online safety to be one of their \"toughest parenting challenges,\u201d she said. Social media had a social responsibility and could do better in addressing harms on their platforms, she added.",
      "\u201cThis is about protecting young people, not punishing or isolating them, and letting parents know that we\u2019re in their corner when it comes to supporting their children\u2019s health and wellbeing,\u201d Rowland said.",
      "Child welfare and internet experts have raised concerns about the ban, including isolating 14- and 15-year-olds from their already established online social networks.",
      "Rowland said there would not be age restrictions placed on messaging services, online games or platforms that substantially support the health and education of users.",
      "\u201cWe are not saying risks don\u2019t exist on messaging apps or online gaming. While users can still be exposed to harmful content by other users, they do not face the same algorithmic curation of content and psychological manipulation to encourage near-endless engagement,\u201d she said.",
      "The government announced last week that a consortium led by British company Age Check Certification Scheme has been contracted to examine various technologies to estimate and verify ages.",
      "In addition to removing children under 16 from social media, Australia is also looking for ways to prevent children under 18 from accessing online pornography, a government statement said.",
      "Age Check Certification Scheme\u2019s chief executive Tony Allen said Monday the technologies being considered included age estimation and age inference. Inference involves establishing a series of facts about individuals that point to them being at least a certain age.",
      "Rowland said the platforms would also face fines of up to AU$50 million ($33 million) if they misused personal information of users gained for age-assurance purposes.",
      "Information used for age assurances must be destroyed after serving that purpose unless the user consents to it being kept, she said.",
      "Digital Industry Group Inc., an advocate for the digital industry in Australia, said with Parliament expected to vote on the bill next week, there might not be time for \u201cmeaningful consultation on the details of the globally unprecedented legislation.\u201d",
      "\"Mainstream digital platforms have strict measures in place to keep young people safe, and a ban could push young people on to darker, less safe online spaces that don't have safety guardrails,\" DIGI managing director Sunita Bose said in a statement. \u201cA blunt ban doesn't encourage companies to continually improve safety because the focus is on keeping teenagers off the service, rather than keeping them safe when they're on it.\u201d"

      "Driving in the snow isn\u2019t enjoyable for many people. It\u2019s cold, the roads are slick, and city traffic is often slow going. But there are ways to have a bit more fun in the wintertime. To start, it helps to have the right vehicle.",
      "Edmunds\u2019 car experts have four recommendations, including one that you\u2019d never guess could be just as enjoyable to drive in the winter snow as it is on dry summer roads. They\u2019re listed below in alphabetical order and are capped to stay under $40,000. All prices include the destination charge.",
      "Of all the pickup trucks on sale in 2024, Edmunds chose the Chevy Colorado as its Edmunds Top Rated Truck of the year. It raises the bar for midsize trucks, and the Trail Boss version exemplifies why.",
      "Equipped with all-terrain tires, an off-road suspension with a 2-inch lift from the factory, and an automatic four-wheel-drive system, the Colorado Trail Boss is a five-passenger crew-cab pickup ready for almost anything. Its turbocharged 2.7-liter four-cylinder engine provides 310 horsepower and 430 lb-ft of torque is plenty for powering through snow drifts or towing up to 7,700 pounds.",
      "The Trail Boss is decently equipped with features, though heated front seats are curiously unavailable. You can add heated side mirrors and all-season floor mats as options.",
      "2024 Chevy Colorado Trail Boss price: $39,195",
      "The retro-styled Ford Bronco is more than just fun to look at. It\u2019s also a blast to drive no matter the weather. It offers praiseworthy capability and character in equal measure, and its rugged design looks cool without trying too hard. The Bronco also has more on-road appeal than the rival Jeep Wrangler thanks to its smoother ride quality and more stable handling.",
      "The Big Bend trim is the Bronco\u2019s base trim level and it offers surprising comfort and practicality. It comes with a part-time four-wheel-drive system, all-terrain tires, and a hardtop with a rear window defroster and a rear window wiper. The turbocharged four-cylinder engine supplies up to 300 horsepower when running on premium fuel, and a seven-speed manual transmission is standard. Technically, the Bronco is priced below $40,000 to start but adding the destination charge puts it slightly over.",

      "That\u2019s true of any Miata. The RF version is better for winter driving thanks to its exclusive weathertight retractable hardtop roof to better keep the cold out and the heat in. Only the Grand Touring trim level slides in under our $40,000 price cap, but it\u2019s well equipped with leather upholstery, heated front seats and heated exterior mirrors. Though the Miata\u2019s low-to-the-ground design limits winter drivability during heavier storms, the car\u2019s playful handling can be a delight to experience following a light snowfall.",
      "2024 Mazda MX-5 Miata RF Grand Touring price: $38,195",
      "Subaru has earned a reputation for building vehicles that are well suited for winter. And among the brand\u2019s current lineup, the most fun to drive for the winter is the WRX. This rally-bred sport sedan pairs a 271-horsepower turbocharged four-cylinder engine with a six-speed manual transmission and standard all-wheel drive to provide impressive traction and acceleration on any road surface.",
      "Most WRX versions are priced under our $40,000 limit. We\u2019d go with the Premium trim for overall value. It comes with cloth upholstery, heated front seats, heated side mirrors and a windshield wiper de-icer, and all-weather floor mats are an option. You can also get it with an automatic transmission.",

      "Delta CEO Ed Bastian made the comment as he and fellow Delta executives prepared to host Wall Street analysts at an investor day Wednesday in Atlanta.",
      "Bastian noted that President-elect Donald Trump campaigned on a pledge to reform the federal government and reduce its size.",
      "The airline executive said Trump promised \u201cto take a fresh look at the regulatory environment, the bureaucracy that exists in government, the level of overreach that we have seen over the last four years within our industry. I think that will be a breath of fresh air.\u201d",
      "Southwest Airlines CEO Robert Jordan struck a similar tone after a speech last week in Dallas.",

      "The group Airlines for America said the rule would confuse consumers by giving them too much information. An appeals court panel blocked enforcement of the rule while the airlines' lawsuit goes ahead.",
      "Airlines also oppose an inquiry that the administration recently launched into their frequent-flyer programs. Delta has received more than $2.4 billion in revenue from its loyalty program so far this year.",
      "But the hardest blow against Delta could come from a Transportation Department investigation into the airline's slow recovery from a technology outage in July. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said investigators were focusing on whether Delta\u2019s treatment of passengers affected by canceled and delayed flights violated federal consumer-protection rules.",
      "Southwest Airlines reached a $140 million settlement after a Transportation Department investigation into a similar but larger breakdown in service in December 2022.",
      "Delta initially said it was cooperating with the investigation. In October, Delta sued CrowdStrike, the cybersecurity provider whose faulty upgrade to Microsoft computers triggered the outage."

      "A supplier of fuel for nuclear power plants has announced a $60 million expansion in Tennessee, promising more manufacturing of high-tech centrifuges there to enrich uranium",
      "OAK RIDGE, Tenn. -- A supplier of fuel for nuclear power plants announced a $60 million expansion in Tennessee on Wednesday, promising to resume and grow its manufacturing of high-tech centrifuges there to enrich uranium at its facility in Ohio.",
      "The expansion by Centrus Energy at its massive facility in Oak Ridge comes as the U.S. ramps up its reliance on nuclear power as a climate change solution. The Tennessee facility, which stretches 440,000 square feet, is where they make and test 40-foot-high centrifuges that will be transported to the company's enrichment facility in Piketon, Ohio. The company gave reporters a tour Wednesday, showing off the centrifuges but covering other classified equipment with tarps.",
      "Centrus is one of several companies working on enriching uranium in the U.S., which is currently dependent on foreign providers. Russia has about 44% of the world\u2019s uranium enrichment capacity, supplying some 35% of U.S. imports for nuclear fuel, according to the Department of Energy. Just last week, Russia announced it would temporarily limit its exports of enriched uranium to the U.S. in response to the U.S. deciding to ban Russian uranium starting in 2028.",
      "Western nuclear operators have been looking for suppliers of nuclear fuel other than Russia since it invaded Ukraine in 2022, S&P Global Commodity Insights said Wednesday.",
      "Centrus President and CEO Amir Vexler told reporters Wednesday that the expansion was not due to Russia's decision-making, saying that the company's board approved the plans a few weeks ago. But he said the move illustrates why the U.S. can't depend on other countries for its nuclear fuel.",
      "\u201cNuclear is one of the key essential stabilizers in our sources on the grid. And nuclear fuel is a key essential element of that,\u201d Vexler said. \u201cWhy would you not worry about the security of supply of that key ingredient to our grid?\u201d",
      "The company partners with the nearby Oak Ridge National Laboratory, known for its role as one of the labs that helped develop the atomic bomb. Centrus is expanding in hopes of tapping into a fund of $3.4 billion from the Department of Energy set aside for domestic uranium enrichment. Headquartered in Bethesda, Maryland, the company currently has about 300 employees, including about 120 in Oak Ridge. The expansion could add 300 more in Oak Ridge.",
      "In the same city, another company, Orano USA, plans to build a uranium enrichment facility.",
      "The Biden administration set a target this month of at least tripling nuclear power in the United States by 2050 to help avoid the worst consequences of climate change. The United States will aim to add 200 gigawatts of new nuclear energy capacity, according to the administration\u2019s new strategy. One gigawatt can power roughly 750,000 to 1 million homes for a year, though the exact amount varies by region and depends on energy use.",
      "The United States currently has 94 operating reactors that produce power without emitting planet-warming greenhouse gases. Nuclear power has provided about one-fifth of the nation\u2019s electricity since the 1990s.",
      "Among the steps to expand nuclear power, the strategy recommends building large gigawatt-scale reactors, constructing small modular reactors and microreactors, extending the lifespan of some existing reactors and working to restart ones that retired for economic reasons. It also recommends improving licensing and developing the nuclear workforce.",
      "President-elect Donald Trump has said he is also interested in developing the next generation of nuclear reactors that are smaller than traditional reactors.",
      "For a company like Centrus, the business strategy includes producing uranium enriched to levels that are standard in the nuclear power plants operating today, plus at a higher level for the type of commercial small reactors that are being developed in the U.S., though none are under construction yet. Centrus' subsidiary, American Centrifuge Operating, was one of four companies awarded a Department of Energy contract aimed at growing the higher-level uranium enrichment.",
      "Some advocates have raised concerns about the more highly enriched uranium.",
      "Edwin Lyman, the director of nuclear power at the Union of Concerned Scientists, said his group thinks the uranium is enriched enough in the process to make nuclear weapons, and worries about the security of keeping the material from getting into the wrong hands either at enrichment facilities, en route elsewhere or at some of the small reactors still in the works.",
      "\u201cThe concern is that we believe that this material is more dangerous than is currently widely accepted,\u201d Lyman said.",
      "Asked about those kind of concerns, Vexler praised the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission as \u201cthe best regulator in the business,\u201d saying regulators ensure the material is safeguarded properly.",

      "North Korea and Russia reached a new agreement for expanding economic cooperation at talks in Pyongyang this week",
      "SEOUL, South Korea -- North Korea and Russia reached a new agreement for expanding economic cooperation following high-level talks in Pyongyang this week, the North\u2019s state media said Thursday, as they continue to align in the face of their confrontations with Washington.",
      "North Korea\u2019s official Korean Central News Agency didn\u2019t elaborate on the details of the agreement signed Wednesday between its senior trade officials and a Russian delegation led by Alexandr Kozlov, the country\u2019s minister of natural resources and ecology. The Russian news agency Tass on Tuesday said officials following an earlier round of talks agreed to increase the number of charter flights between the countries to promote tourism.",
      "Kozlov, who arrived in North Korea on Sunday, met with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and his top economic official, Premier Kim Tok Hun, before returning home on Wednesday, KCNA said. During Kozlov\u2019s visit, Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s gifted Pyongyang\u2019s Central Zoo with more than 70 animals, including lions, bears and several species of birds, according to Tass, in another display of the countries\u2019 growing ties.",
      "Kim Jong Un in recent months has prioritized relations with Moscow as he attempts to break out of international isolation and strengthen his footing, actively supporting Putin\u2019s war on Ukraine while portraying the North as a player in a united front against Washington.",
      "Kim has yet to directly acknowledge that he has been providing military equipment and troops to Russia to support its fighting against Ukraine. South Korea\u2019s National Intelligence Service told lawmakers in a closed-door briefing on Wednesday that an estimated 11,000 North Korean soldiers in late October were moved to Russia\u2019s Kursk region, where Ukrainian troops seized parts of its territory this year, following their training in Russia\u2019s northeast.",
      "The spy agency believes the North Korean soldiers were assigned to Russia\u2019s marine and airborne forces units and some of them have already begun fighting alongside the Russians on the frontlines, said Lee Seong Kweun, a lawmaker who attended the meeting. U.S., South Korean and Ukrainian officials have claimed that the North has also been supplying Russia with artillery systems, missiles and other equipment.",
      "North Korea would be possibly getting anywhere between $320 million to $1.3 billion annually from Russia for sending its troops to Ukraine, considering the scale of the dispatch and the level of payments Russia has been providing to foreign mercenaries, according to a recent study by Lim Soo-ho, a South Korean analyst at an NIS-run think tank.",
      "While that would be meaningful income for North Korea\u2019s crippled and heavily sanctioned economy, it could be lower than the money the North earns from illicit coal exports or supplying military equipment to Russia, Lim said. This suggests that North Korea\u2019s troop dispatch is less about money than acquiring key Russian technologies to further advance its nuclear weapons and missile program, which is a major concern in Seoul, Lim said.",
      "Amid the stalemate in larger nuclear negotiations with Washington, Kim has been dialing up pressure on South Korea, abandoning his country\u2019s long-standing goal of inter-Korean reconciliation and verbally threatening to attack the South with nukes if provoked. He has used Russia\u2019s war on Ukraine as a distraction to accelerate the development of his nuclear-armed military, which now has various nuclear-capable systems targeting South Korea and intercontinental ballistic missiles that can potentially reach the U.S. mainland.",

      "\u201cWhat other choice do we have?\u201d said Timchenko during an interview on the sidelines of this year's U.N. climate talks, taking place in Azerbaijan. \u201cSit and wait and pray that they don't hit us, or do our job and bring lights back to our people?\u201d",
      "The nearly three-year-long Russia-Ukraine war, which has left large swaths of Ukraine destroyed, has accelerated a transition to clean energy. At Ukraine's pavilion at COP29, on display is a large smashed solar panel, destroyed in an attack this year.",
      "Russian forces continue to make small but steady gains in capturing Ukrainian territory at a time when there are questions about how much the United States, which has been providing weapons and money, will continue to support the country once President-elect Donald Trump assumes office in January. During the campaign, Trump repeatedly said he could quickly end the war if elected, although he hasn't said how.",
      "Whatever the future, the decentralized nature of some clean energies, in particular wind and solar, has allowed Ukraine to quickly restore power in ways that would be impossible with Ukraine's more traditional energy sources, such as coal-fired power plants.",
      "In centralized systems, all power is generated and sent to the grid over transmission lines from the same area. That means if the plant goes down, say in an attack, a large section of grid, or even the entire grid, comes to a halt. By contrast, wind and solar installations are usually more scattered, so less of the system goes down with one hit, and if the solar is on rooftops, the impact can be even more limited.",
      "Attacks on two DTEK solar farms last spring is a good example. They destroyed many solar panels and some of the transformers, which step up voltage for long distances or step it down for use in homes. Replacing the transformers and swapping out destroyed panels allowed the farms, which generate 400 megawatts, to be back up in seven days.",
      "Timchenko said an attack on a thermal generating station, which experienced a similar amount of damage, took three to four months to rebuild.",
      "\u201cThat's the difference between centralized and so-called decentralized generation. It's much more resistant and difficult to destroy,\u201d said Timchenko.",
      "Geoffrey Pyatt, assistant secretary of the U.S. State Department's Bureau of Energy Resources, said that Russian attacks on energy infrastructure have evolved. In 2022 and 2023, they focused on transformers.",
      "\u201cThe Ukrainians were incredibly efficient in working around those attacks. So Putin changed his tactics beginning in March to go after generation capacity,\" said Pyatt, referring to Russian President Vladimir Putin.",
      "Since then, about 50% of Ukraine's total power generation has been knocked out, leaving mostly nuclear, some hydropower and large new renewable projects, like a wind farm being built by DTEK, he added.",
      "Renewable and other infrastructure projects are financed by partnerships between governments and businesses, spreading out the risk, since there is no guarantee that something built isn't destroyed by missiles. In June, turbine maker GE Vernova and manufacturer Honeywell announced plans to partner with DTEK for major wind and battery storage projects in Ukraine.",
      "Roger Martella, chief sustainability officer for GE Vernova, said that developing public-private partnerships was key to lowering risk and making investment more attractive. Ukraine's resistance was also an inspiration, Martella told a panel on Ukrainian renewables at COP29.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re humbled by the fact that Ukraine has done something no one has ever done before, which is to maintain the grid in a war-torn environment,\u201d said Martella.",
      "Pyatt, a former ambassador in Ukraine, said he has seen widespread support for Ukraine's energy systems in the G7, a group of leading industrialized nations.",
      "While making clear he couldn't speak for the incoming Trump administration, Pyatt said he believed support for Ukraine in the energy sector would \u201ccontinue in any scenario.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf you start to get big American companies like GE and Fluxus and Honeywell involved in energy reconstruction, and there\u2019s going to be billions of dollars of energy reconstruction,\" he said.",

      "Experts say people shopping for health insurance right now should look beyond price when searching for coverage for next year",
      "Everyone likes a good deal, and health insurance bargains abound this time of year. But buyers should look beyond price when searching for a plan.",
      "Shoppers also should consider doctor networks and coverage limits to avoid getting stuck with big bills after care.",
      "Millions of Americans are looking for 2025 coverage now during annual enrollment windows for Medicare Advantage plans and individual insurance. Plus, many employers are telling their workers about their coverage plans for next year too.",
      "Insurers selling Medicare Advantage plans are dangling coverage with $0 premiums, and individual insurance marketplaces created through the Affordable Care Act offer tax credits to help with the premium or cost of coverage.",
      "Here are other factors to consider beyond price.",
      "This is the annual amount a patient pays for many covered services before the insurer starts paying a portion of the bill. Plans with low premiums can come with deductibles well over $1,000 for individuals and a few thousand dollars for families.",
      "Shoppers should look at the size of the individual deductible and understand where it applies. Regular visits to a specialist can lead to some hefty patient bills.",
      "Deductibles are different from copayments or copays. Those are flat amounts that a patient pays for a covered service or doctor visit. Copays typically do not count toward paying off a deductible.",
      "Insurers form networks of covered doctors and health systems. Some plans may provide no coverage for care sought outside those networks.",
      "The federal government\u2019s website for finding insurance plans makes it easy to filter for covered doctors and hospitals when looking for plans, said Emily Bremer, president of a St. Louis-based independent insurance agency, The Bremer Group.",
      "Bremer says shoppers should think about more than whether their doctors are in the network. They also should also consider which hospital system they would want to visit if a big emergency happens.",
      "Insurance plans come with formularies, or lists of covered drugs, that vary by plan. Those lists often group drugs in tiers with different costs for the patient.",
      "Shoppers should check to see how a plan will cover the regular prescriptions they already take.",
      "Don\u2019t immediately rule out the plan if the bill would be too high. Help may be available. Drugmakers often have coupons or discount programs that can cover patient costs as long as the drug has coverage, Bremer said. Websites like GoodRx also may be an option for getting a price break.",
      "\u201cIf you take a lot of stuff and see a lot of doctors \u2026 it can be really hard to find one perfect plan that\u2019s going to cover everything,\u201d she said. \u201cSometimes you have to make choices.\u201d",
      "This is the portion of a bill the patient is responsible for after meeting the deductible. It\u2019s a percentage that can vary. Usually plans with lower premiums leave patients with bigger coinsurance.",
      "Coinsurance payments can hurt, so it\u2019s important to know the percentage and the risk you face.",
      "For instance, a childbirth by cesarean section may generate a $25,000 bill. A patient responsible for a $1,000 deductible and then 20% of the remaining bill through coinsurance could pay $5,800 of that total.",
      "\u201cMost people will focus on the deductible and forget about the coinsurance, and they should not,\u201d Bremer said. \u201c(It) can really sneak up on you when you have a large claim.\u201d",
      "People with low incomes may qualify for help with some of these out-of-pocket expenses through cost-sharing reductions found in the ACA marketplaces.",
      "Health insurers will start handling all costs for covered, in-network care once you reach a plan\u2019s out-of-pocket maximum for patient spending. That can vary by plan.",
      "For coverage sold on the ACA marketplace, that annual maximum cannot be more than $9,200 for individuals and $18,400 for families next year.",
      "Those who reach this level of spending may only see temporary relief. Patient spending totals that count toward that out-of-pocket maximum generally reset at the start of every calendar year or if you switch plans during the year.",

      "Comcast is spinning off into a new company many of its cable television networks that were once at the heart of the entertainment giant, as consumers increasingly swap out their cable TV subscriptions for streaming platforms",
      "WASHINGTON -- Comcast is spinning off into a new company many of the cable television networks that were once at the entertainment giant's heart as consumers increasingly swap out their cable TV subscriptions for streaming platforms.",
      "Those one-time stars for Comcast's NBCUniversal cable television networks include USA, Oxygen, E!, SYFY and Golf Channel, as well as CNBC and MSNBC. Movie ticketing platform Fandango and the Rotten Tomatoes movie rating site will also become part of the new company.",
      "Streaming service Peacock will remain with Comcast, as will Bravo, which provides significant content for the Peacock streaming service, and other assets like the NBCUniversal's studios and theme parks.",
      "Comcast telegraphed the shift last month, before confirming Wednesday that it will spin off assets that generated about $7 billion in revenue over the past 12 months ending Sept. 30. That\u2019s about 5.5% of Comcast\u2019s total revenue during that period, according to the company.",
      "How exactly this split will impact customers is not yet clear. Experts maintain it\u2019s too early to tell, given that Comcast aims to complete the transition over the next year.",
      "Some analysts speculate that the spun-off networks may have more freedom to bring their content elsewhere. That could mean you'll have more options to find and curate what you want to watch and where \u2014 or headaches from juggling several different subscriptions in an already-fractured media landscape.",
      "Wednesday's announcement arrives as more and more people \u201ccut the cord\u201d on cable, with millions canceling service subscriptions every year \u2014 and instead signing up for streaming platforms.",
      "Paul Verna, principal analyst and vice president of content for market research company eMarketer, said Comcast\u2019s decision to divest itself from most of its cable TV channels is a reflection of that trend.",
      "\u201cThe writing is on the wall that the cable TV business is a dwindling business,\u201d Verna said. \u201cThat\u2019s why Comcast did what it did today.\u201d",
      "Mike Proulx, a vice president and research director of Forrester, added that the spin-off marks \u201csimply a reconciliation of assets that detract from the company\u2019s inevitable all streaming future.\u201d",
      "Comcast expects the new company, which it referred to as \u201cSpinCo\u201d Wednesday, to have the financial flexibility to be \u201ca potential partner and acquirer of other complementary media businesses.\u201d And Mark Lazarus, the current chairman of NBCUniversal Media Group who will serve as the new entity\u2019s CEO, said Wednesday that the standalone company \u201cwill be better positioned to serve our audiences and drive shareholder returns.\u201d",
      "Like other cable companies, Comcast in recent years has shifted its business emphasis away from traditional cable toward streaming and other sources of revenue, such as its movie studio, theme parks and home wireless and internet services.",
      "Despite a slightly confusing, glitchy start, Peacock has been one of the company's biggest success stories, with recent boosts gained in part by the streaming platform's popularity during the 2024 Paris Olympic Games. In its most recent quarter, Comcast reported that paid Peacock subscribers jumped by 3 million, or 29%, to 36 million subscribers. Peacock\u2019s revenue soared 82% to $1.5 billion in the period.",
      "Dropping \u201cmoney-losing assets\u201d to instead focus on these kinds of lucrative business is clearly beneficial to Comcast, Verna said \u2014 but the future of a new company housing primarily cable networks is less promising. He said he finds it hard \u201cto envision that this company will stay independent for a long time,\" predicting future consolidation of the networks or acquisitions through private equity.",
      "Howard Gutman, private equity strategy and coverage lead for MorganFranklin Consulting, also expects consolidation to be in the cards. He noted the spin-off might entice bigger streaming services that are in search of more content, for example, to buy up these kinds of assets.",
      "That could mean watchers of the Golf Channel, for example, finding its content on what were once rival platforms. But the spun-off assets might also find more power to focus on priorities specific to them under a smaller company umbrella, Gutman added. That would potentially open the door for networks like CNBC to further monetize its own content or expand its brand.",
      "\u201cI think it will open up opportunities,\u201d he said, adding that customers will also have more options to curate subscriptions based on what interests them the most.",
      "Verna is less optimistic. He pointed to a history of changes in the media landscape that has repeatedly been tough for consumers.",
      "People already have a hard time figuring out where to watch or stream something they're looking for, Verna said, and deals to license or spread that out further could worsen that. And paying for more and more services adds up, particularly as platforms have hiked prices over time.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s too early to know what impact (the Comcast spin-offs) will have .... But I wouldn\u2019t hold my breath (on there being) a net benefit to consumers,\u201d Verna said. \u201cConsumers are the ones who are supposed to be driving these trends, and to some extent they are. But they also tend to get the short end of the stick every time.\u201d",
      "The spin-off is targeted for completion in about a year, the entertainment giant said Wednesday, pending financing and approval from its board and government regulators.",
      "Beyond Lazarus' appointment to CEO of the new company, Anand Kini, the current chief financial officer of NBCUniversal, will take on the same title with the new company as well as the chief operating officer role.",
      "Shares of Comcast, based in Philadelphia, ended up 1.6% Wednesday.",
      "Comcast reported revenue of more than $32 billion and profit of $1.12 per share in its most recent quarter, boosted by the summer box-office success of \"Despicable Me 4,\" which grossed more than $1 billion worldwide.",

      "Ford is cutting its workforce by 4,000 in Europe and the U.K. by the end of 2027, citing headwinds from the economy and pressure from increased competition and weaker-than-expected sales of electric cars",
      "FRANKFURT, Germany -- Ford Motor Co. says it will reduce its workforce by 4,000 in Europe and the U.K. by the end of 2027, citing headwinds from the economy and pressure from increased competition and weaker than expected sales of electric cars.",
      "Ford said Wednesday most of the job cuts would come in Germany and would be carried out in consultation with employee representatives.",
      "Of the total, 2,900 jobs would be lost in Germany, 800 in Britain and 300 in other European Union countries. Ford has 28,000 employees in Europe, and 174,000 worldwide.",
      "\u201cThe global auto industry continues to be in a period of significant disruption as it shifts to electrified mobility,\u201d the company said in a statement. \u201cThe transformation is particularly intense in Europe where automakers face significant competitive and economic headwinds while also tackling a misalignment between CO2 regulations and consumer demand for electrified vehicles,\u201d the statement said.",
      "In Europe, automakers must sell enough electric vehicles to meet new, lower limits for fleet average carbon dioxide emissions in 2025, and face a longer term 2035 EU goal of reducing emissions to zero, which would mean the elimination of most vehicles with internal combustion engines.",

      "Unfortunately for the Bengals, it hasn't worked out that way so far.",
      "Cincinnati is mired in 10th place in the AFC with a 4-7 record despite having a chance to become the first team since sacks became an official stat in 1982 to have the league leader in yards passing, yards receiving and sacks in the same season.",
      "Six of the Bengals losses have come by seven points or fewer thanks to some missed field goals in key spots, defensive breakdowns and no go-ahead TD drives by Burrow and the offense in the fourth quarter.",
      "Burrow became the second QB in NFL history to lose consecutive starts when throwing for at least 350 yards and three TDs without an interception in a 34-27 loss to the Chargers on Sunday night. The Bengals rallied from 27-6 down to tie the score in the fourth before Evan McPherson missed two field goals and the Bengals punted in the final minute to set up the Chargers' game-winning drive.",
      "Burrow has thrown for 3,028 yards with 27 TDs and four interceptions this season. The seven previous QBs who threw for at least 3,000 yards and 25 TDs with five or fewer interceptions in the first 11 games combined for a 69-8 record compared to Burrow's 4-7 mark.",
      "Burrow isn't alone in putting up prolific numbers in Cincinnati with Chase leading the NFL with 73 catches, 1,056 yards and 12 TDs.

Goff had his second career game with at least 400 yards, four TDs and the highest attainable passer rating of 158.3, having also done it for the Rams against Minnesota in 2018.",

      "The Steelers became the second team in the last 20 seasons to win multiple games in a season without a TD, joining the 2016 Rams.",
      "In all, Tomlin has won five games in his career in the regular season or playoffs when his team doesn't score a touchdown, one shy of Marv Levy for the most by any coach since 1972. Tomlin's .333 win percentage when his team doesn't score a touchdown ranks first in that span among the 73 coaches who have had at least 10 games without a TD.",

Hill became the first player in NFL history to rush for at least 100 yards and three TDs, have at least 50 yards receiving and throw for at least 10 yards.",
      "He did it by lining up all over the Saints offense with 10 snaps from the slot, eight at quarterback, six as a running back, four as a wide receiver and four as a tight end, according to NFL NextGen Stats. He became the first player in the NGS era beginning in 2016 to have at least four snaps at all five of those positions.",
      "Hill's best work came out of the backfield as he had TD runs of 10, 33 and 75 yards. Only three players since the merger older than Hill (34 years, 86 days) rushed for more yards in a game with John Riggins gaining 165 and 140 in two games at age 35 for Washington in 1984, and 36-year-old MacArthur Lane rushing for 144 yards for Kansas City at Buffalo in 1978.",

      "ARLINGTON, Va. -- Alex Ovechkin is on injured reserve, and the Washington Capitals are coming to grips with playing without their superstar captain for the coming weeks.",
      "Ovechkin is considered week-to-week with a lower left leg injury, and going on IR rules him out for at least the next three games. The absence puts a pause on his pursuit of Wayne Gretzky's NHL career goals record and takes the best pure scorer of this generation off the ice until further notice.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s the hottest guy in the league, and he\u2019s chasing something bigger than hockey,\u201d longtime teammate Tom Wilson said after practice Wednesday. \u201cI think everyone in the hockey world just feels that bit of letdown, that emotion that you\u2019re just pulling for him and he\u2019s putting everything he has into it. He feels all that pressure. The whole world of hockey is just rooting him on. So, to come in (to the locker room) and see that he was hurt, it hurt a little bit as a teammate, but at the end of the day, that\u2019s hockey.\u201d",
      "Ovechkin was injured in a shin-on-shin collision with Utah's Jack McBain on Monday night. The 39-year-old winger went down in obvious pain, then tried to skate and test out the leg minutes later before limping down the tunnel.",
      "Coach Spencer Carbery confirmed it was not a season-ending injury and expects a more specific diagnosis and timeframe to be available Thursday after further evaluation by doctors. Carbery described Ovechkin's initial reaction as \u201cbummed,\" while veteran defenseman John Carlson said Ovechkin was handling it \u201clike a human being,\u201d with plenty of emotions attached.",

Hopefully it\u2019s not long and that he\u2019s able to get back. Injuries are part of it. I think everyone has to deal with them, but I\u2019d certainly like to see him get healthy and continue to pursue that goal.\u201d",
      "Ovechkin scored 15 goals in his first 18 games this season to take the league lead and move 27 back of passing Gretzky. Before the injury, he was on pace to break the record sometime in February.",
      "That likely will have to wait until the spring or perhaps early next season after this injury, which could lead to Ovechkin's longest absence of his two-decade NHL career. He has missed just 59 games total and only 35 because of injury since debuting in 2005.",
      "\u201cI was having a little deja vu about just being in the locker room before we go on the ice and \u2014 almost every time \u2014 he\u2019s there,\u201d Carlson said. \"There\u2019s minutes to be played and goals to be scored.\u201d",
      "The Capitals put Ovechkin on IR and injured winger Sonny Milano on long-term IR with an undisclosed upper-body injury and recalled young Russian winger Ivan Miroshnichenko from Hershey of the American Hockey League. Carbery does not want Miroshnichenko to think he has to fill in for Ovechkin and is still deciding how to proceed with the lineup moving forward.",
      "One possibility on the top line is Jakub Vrana, who along with Ovechkin, Wilson, Carlson and recent trade reacquisition Lars Eller is among the few players remaining from the 2018 Stanley Cup championship team. But it will take more than one player to make up for Ovechkin being out for however long.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re going to face the reality,\u201d Vrana said. \u201cObviously, it\u2019s hard. He\u2019s our captain and everything. But at the same time, it is what it is. And we\u2019re going to prepare on winning games without him.\u201d",

      "NEW YORK -- Major League Baseball will test robot umpires as part of a challenge system during spring training at 13 ballparks hosting 19 teams, which could lead to regular-season use in 2026.",
      "MLB has been experimenting with the automated ball-strike system in the minor leagues since 2019 but is still working on the shape of the strike zone.",
      "An agreement for big league use would have to be reached with the Major League Baseball Umpires Association, whose collective bargaining agreement expires Dec. 1.",
      "\u201cI would be interested in having it in \u201826,\u201d baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred said Wednesday after an owners\u2019 meeting. \u201cWe do have a collective bargaining obligation there. That\u2019s obviously a term and condition of employment. We\u2019re going to have to work through that issue, as well.\u201d",
      "Manfred said the spring training experiment will have to be evaluated before MLB determines how to move forward.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s two sides to that test,\" he said. \"It\u2019s what the clubs think about it and also what do the players think about it? And we\u2019re going to have to sort through both of those.\u201d",
      "Triple-A ballparks used ABS this year for the second straight season, but there is little desire to call the strike zone as the cube defined in the rule book and MLB has experimented with modifications during minor league testing.",
      "The ABS currently calls strikes solely based on where the ball crosses the midpoint of the plate, 8.5 inches from the front and the back. The top of the strike zone was increased to 53.5% of batter height this year from 51%, and the bottom remained at 27%.",
      "After splitting having the robot alone for the first three games of each series and a human with a challenge system in the final three during the first 2 1/2 months of the Triple-A season, MLB on June 25 switched to an all-challenge system in which a human umpire makes nearly all decisions.",
      "During the second half of the season, each team had three challenges in the Pacific Coast League and two in the International League. A team retains its challenge if successful, similar to the regulations for big league teams with video reviews.",
      "\u201cI think we will have a spring training ABS test that will provide a meaningful opportunity for all major league players to see what the challenge system will look like,\u201d Manfred said. \"It won\u2019t be in every single ballpark but we actually have a plan where every team will get meaningful exposure.\u201d",

Cleveland, which won a playoff series last year for the first time since LeBron James left the second time in 2018, wasn\u2019t expected to be a contender.",
      "But it was the Cavaliers who shot to the top of the standings this fall, with a franchise-record 15-game winning streak that left them as the last unbeaten team in the league. Coach Kenny Atkinson was the first NBA coach ever to win his first 15 games with a new team.",
      "\u201cYou want to be a part of history in that regard. But it\u2019s a thing of the past. It\u2019s over with. And, you know, it was a good run,\u201d Mitchell said. \u201cIt was fun. When you\u2019re playing basketball, good basketball, and obviously winning games -- whether it\u2019s blowouts, close games, come-from-behind wins -- you enjoy these moments.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s great to be part of history. We wish we had kept it going,\u201d he said. \"But, like I said, there\u2019s no championships in November.\u201d",
      "The Celtics used a 3-point barrage on Tuesday night to open a 21-point lead, then watched as the Cavs cut it to two in the third quarter. Cleveland trailed by nine, 114-105, with 90 seconds left before Mitchell hit a floater and then another layup to cut the deficit to five points.",
      "With Boston up 117-110 and 25 seconds left, Mitchell hit a rainbow 3-pointer to make it a four-point game. After Jayson Tatum, who scored 33, hit one of two free throws, the Celtics star bowled Mitchell over while going for a steal.",
      "Mitchell stayed down on the court for a few minutes, but the play was not reviewed to determine if it was a potential flagrant foul that would give the Cavaliers a pair of free throws and the ball.",
      "\"I was just praying to God I didn\u2019t have a concussion. That\u2019s my only thing,\u201d said Mitchell, who watched the play again after the game and didn\u2019t think it should have been ruled a flagrant foul. \u201cIt was a play on the ball. He\u2019s got bony shoulders. So I hit his shoulder, and it is what it is.\u201d",
      "Atkinson blamed himself for not having an answer for a Celtics team that went 14 for 22 from 3-point range in the first half to open a 17-point lead. And he praised his team, which faced the Celtics without Issac Okoro (ankle), Caris LeVert (knee) and DeanWade (ankle), for erasing almost all of that deficit in the third quarter.",
      "\"They shot the heck out of it,\" Atkinson said. \u201cThat big second quarter, that was too much to overcome. Second half, we turned it up, but it\u2019s kind of too late.\u201d",
      "And the coach was already looking to their next matchup, in Cleveland on Dec. 1.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re so good. We gave resistance in the second half, but ... a lot of stuff we can improve on,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ll have another shot at them soon.\"",

      "Rafael Nadal's retirement from tennis serves as a reminder that for all of his Grand Slam titles and other successes, his greatest legacy might be the qualities that inspired Carlos Alcaraz, Iga Swiatek and other younger players",
      "MALAGA, Spain -- Not surprisingly, Rafael Nadal couldn\u2019t take a step around the grounds of the Davis Cup Final 8 in recent days without hearing requests for a handshake or a selfie. And that was just from the other professional tennis players, to speak nothing of the fans.",
      "The significance of Nadal\u2019s retirement is lost on no one inside or outside the sport he is walking away from at age 38 after a litany of injuries, and for all of the well-documented success he enjoyed, his greatest legacy might be the way he inspired other players. The 22-time Grand Slam champion and all-time great of the game lost the last match of his career as Spain was eliminated by the Netherlands in the quarterfinals as Tuesday turned to Wednesday.",
      "The last man to face \u2014 and beat \u2014 Nadal, 80th-ranked Botic van de Zandschulp, who is 29, spoke after his 6-4, 6-4 victory about idolizing the Spaniard. Many current players grew up watching Nadal, admiring him for his skill \u2014 from the big, topspin left-handed forehands to the pinpoint volleys and everything in between \u2014 and his relentless nature, his commitment to seeking improvement and, maybe most of all, his off-court humility.",
      "He set an example for others, from contemporaries Roger Federer or Novak Djokovic or Serena Williams, to members of the following generations, including heir apparent Carlos Alcaraz.",
      "\u201cI was a big Rafa fan. Used to wear all his kits, his shoes, everything. A lot of neon colors,\u201d said Ben Shelton, a 22-year-old member of the U.S. team that faces Australia on Thursday, when the other quarterfinal is defending champion Italy and No. 1-ranked Jannik Sinner against Argentina. \u201cAnd being a lefty, he\u2019s a guy that I have always kind of watched and tried to learn things from. One of those perfect examples of how to do things on and off the court, how to handle the press, how to win with class, how to lose with class.\u201d",
      "That sentiment was echoed by player after player, many of whom were thrilled to be on-site for his farewell.",
      "\u201cFor him to have this as his finishing point, it\u2019s an honor for the event,\" said Yannick Hanfmann, part of the German squad that defeated Canada 2-0 on Wednesday and will meet the Netherlands in the semifinals on Friday. \"He\u2019s present everywhere. In the training area, when he\u2019s walking around, you see the people looking and trying to get some pictures, here and there. He\u2019s got this aura that already was big, but now that this is the end, it\u2019s maybe more important.\u201d",
      "Hanfmann and others were struck by Nadal's dedication to chasing every shot down. By a refusal to accept defeat, no matter the deficit. By his longevity and consistency \u2014 nearly 18 full years in a row ranked in the top 10; 10 consecutive years with at least one major title \u2014 and his dizzying peaks, including the 14 French Open championships that earned him the \u201cKing of Clay\u201d nickname.",
      "His unfailing politeness, seen in such gestures as when he would say goodbye to every volunteer on his way out of a tournament or, just this Monday, when he arrived at Spain\u2019s team news conference and made a beeline for the stenographer to shake the hand of the person who would be typing up the transcript of the Q-and-A session for reporters.",
      "\u201c The titles, the numbers, are there, so people probably know that, but the way I would like to be remembered is as a good person from a small village in Mallorca,\u201d Nadal said during a tear-filled post-match ceremony at the sold-out Palacio de Deportes Jose Maria Martin Carpena, where thousands serenaded him with a chorus of \u201cRaaaa-faaa! Raaaa-faaa!\u201d",
      "\u201cJust a kid that followed their dreams,\u201d he said, \u201c (and) worked as hard as possible.\u201d",
      "No opponent, or any observer for that matter, could ever question his effort, even as injury after injury made things tougher, especially over the past two seasons.",
      "No one ever doubted his drive to get better.",
      "\"I really will miss watching him on court,\u201d said Iga Swiatek, a five-time Grand Slam champion and long an unabashed fan of Nadal\u2019s. \u201cHonestly, he was the only player I watched, so I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m going to watch tennis at all now. He\u2019s a huge inspiration.\u201d",
      "That last word, or a variation of it, was used over and over again as tributes to Nadal were offered.",
      "So were \u201cintensity\u201d and \u201cpassion,\u201d \u201cgrit\u201d and \u201crole model.\u201d",
      "\u201cFor me,\u201d said Alcaraz, a 21-year-old Spaniard with four major trophies, \u201cit\u2019s difficult to accept that Rafael Nadal is going to retire, honestly.\u201d",

      "The state of Romania does not recognize Kosovo\u2019s declaration of independence in 2008 from Serbia.",

      "Lautaro Mart\u00ednez\u2019s goal gave Argentina a 1-0 win over Peru in a South American qualifying match in Buenos Aires and put the hosts close to a spot in the 2026 World Cup in the United States, Mexico and Canada",
      "BUENOS AIRES -- Lautaro Mart\u00ednez's goal gave Argentina a 1-0 win over Peru on Tuesday in a South American qualifying match in Buenos Aires and left the hosts close to a spot in the 2026 World Cup in the United States, Mexico and Canada.",
      "Its main continental rivals Brazil drew 1-1 against Uruguay in Salvador, Brazil with two impressive goals in an otherwise lackluster match. Federico Valverde gave Uruguay the lead with a curled shot from the edge of the box, and Gerson netted his first for Brazil in similar fashion at the Arena Fonte Nova.",
      "Argentina leads South American qualifying with 25 points from 12 matches, five points clear of its closest competitor, Uruguay. Ecuador and Colombia are next with 19 points each.",
      "Brazil lags in fifth position with 18 points after several uninspiring performances, still hoping that striker Neymar will return from injury and fit in again. Paraguay, with 17 points, is in sixth place.",
      "South American qualifying will give six direct berths in the next World Cup. Seventh-place Bolivia, with 13 points, is in the international playoff position. Venezuela (12), Chile (9), and Peru (7) are out of qualifying spots.",
      "The next round of South American World Cup qualifying will be played in March.",
      "Mart\u00ednez's goal was his 32nd for the national team, which puts him level with the legendary Diego Maradona.",
      "Until Mart\u00ednez scored, Argentina's best chance was in the 21st minute, when striker Juli\u00e1n Alvarez hit the Peruvian goalkeeper's right post. Messi once again had a modest performance, as he did in his team's 2-1 defeat at Paraguay on Thursday.",
      "Messi crossed the ball in the penalty area in the 55th minute to give Mart\u00ednez one of the few clear opportunities of the match. The striker moved his body with more grace than power to put the ball in the back of the next.",
      "Despite the disappointing performance at home, Lionel Messi's team will finish the year with few question marks beyond its performances in November.",
      "\u201cWe won Copa America, we lead South American World Cup qualifying,\u201d said goalkeeper Emiliano Mart\u00ednez. \u201cWe must be proud of ourselves.\u201d",
      "Brazil fans at home in Salvador jeered their team after the final whistle. In a match with few opportunities for either side, Uruguay seemed closer to winning for most of the second half.",
      "Valverde opened the scoring in the 55th minute after Brazilian defenders failed three times to clear the ball from their penalty area. The Real Madrid midfielder hit the ball to the left corner to score. Gerson equalized in the 61st minute.",
      "Striker Raphinha said he understood the frustration from his team's fans, but disagreed with them.",
      "\u201cWe played great. We did everything we could to leave here with a victory. We must have our heads high up, it will be very tough to beat us,\u201d he said.",
      "Also on Tuesday, Ecuador won 1-0 at Colombia with a goal by Enner Valencia in the seventh minute, in which he dribbled through three players before scoring. Ecuador lost defender Piero Hincapi\u00e9 to a red card in the 34th minute but held on for the win.",
      "Bolivia and Paraguay drew 2-2 in a match between teams that could end up fighting for the seventh position in the region's qualifying. Chile, one of the worst performing teams in the region this year, showed some fighting spirit and beat Venezuela 4-2.",

    "story": [
      "Nvidia has reported a surge in third-quarter profit and sales as demand for its specialized computer chips that power artificial intelligence systems remains robust",
      "LOS ANGELES -- Nvidia on Wednesday reported a surge in third-quarter profit and sales as demand for its specialized computer chips that power artificial intelligence systems remains robust.",
      "For the three months that ended Oct. 27, the tech giant based in Santa Clara, California, posted revenue of $35.08 billion, up 94% from $18.12 billion a year ago.",
      "Nvidia said it earned $19.31 billion in the quarter, more than double the $9.24 billion it posted in last year\u2019s third quarter. Adjusted for one-time items, it earned 81 cents a share.",
      "Wall Street analysts had been expecting adjusted earnings of 75 cents a share on revenue of $33.17 billion, according to FactSet.",
      "Investors took the results in stride, however, and Nvidia\u2019s high-flying stock slipped about 1% in after-hours trading. Shares in Nvidia Corp. are up 195% so far this year. Nvidia said it expects fourth quarter revenue to grow to $37.5 billion, plus or minus 2%. Analysts are expecting, on average, $37.09 billion.",
      "\u201cThe age of AI is in full steam, propelling a global shift to Nvidia computing,\u201d Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of Nvidia, said in a statement.",
      "Nvidia\u2019s third-quarter data center revenue was $30.8 billion, up 112% from a year ago. That growth was driven by demand for the Hopper computing platform for large language models, recommendation engines and generative AI applications, the company said.",
      "Analysts\u2019 were eyeing Nvidia\u2019s guidance on its Blackwell graphics processor unit, a next-generation artificial intelligence chip that's seen demand from companies like OpenAI and others building AI data centers.",
      "Nvidia Chief Financial Officer Colette Kress said Blackwell production shipments are scheduled to begin in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025 and will continue to ramp into fiscal 2026.",
      "On an earnings call Wednesday, Kress told investors that both Hopper GPU and Blackwell systems \u201chave certain supply constraints, and the demand for Blackwell is expected to exceed supply for several quarters in fiscal 2026.\u201d",
      "\u201cEvery customer is racing to be the first to market,\u201d Kress said. \u201cBlackwell is now in the hands of all of our major partners, and they are working to bring up their data centers.\u201d",
      "The company, seen as a bellwether for AI demand, will deliver \u201cmore Blackwells than we had previously estimated\u201d this quarter, Huang added.",
      "Nvidia has led the artificial intelligence sector to become one of the stock market\u2019s biggest companies, as tech giants spend heavily on the company\u2019s chips and data centers needed to train and operate their AI systems.",
      "The company carved out an early lead in AI applications race, in part because of Huang\u2019s successful bet on the chip technology used to fuel the industry. The company is no stranger to big bets. Nvidia\u2019s invention of graphics processor chips, or GPUs, in 1999 helped spark the growth of the PC gaming market and redefined computer graphics. The company's third-quarter gaming revenue rose to $3.3 billion, an increase of 15% from a year ago.",
      "Nvidia's fourth-quarter guidance was \u201ca little bit disappointing,\u201d said David Volpe, senior fund manager at Emerald Insights Fund, but the company still had \u201ca tremendous quarter.\"",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s nothing touching it in terms of the growth,\u201d Volpe said.",
      "Demand for generative AI products that can compose documents, make images and serve as personal assistants has fueled sales of Nvidia\u2019s specialized chips over the last year. Nvidia, the most valuable publicly traded company by market cap as of Wednesday morning, is now worth over $3.5 trillion, with analysts closely monitoring Nvidia's path to $4 trillion.",
      "Dan Ives, an analyst with Wedbush Securities, said the earnings report shows \u201cthe AI Revolution is still in the early innings of playing out.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe view this as a Nvidia earnings press release that should be hung in the Louvre,\u201d Ives said. \u201cBlackwell demand is just beginning. Any sell off (in Nvidia's stock) we would view as short lived, with our view this is a $4 trillion market cap in 2025 as the Godfather of AI Jensen (Huang) drives this spending wave.\u201d",
      "Through the year\u2019s first six months, Nvidia\u2019s stock soared nearly 150%. At that point, the stock was trading at a little more than 100 times the company\u2019s earnings over the prior 12 months. That\u2019s much more expensive than it\u2019s been historically and than the S&P 500 in general.",
      "\u201cThe age of AI is upon us,\" Huang said on the call. \"And it\u2019s large and diverse.\u201d"

    "published": "Wed, 20 Nov 2024 20:34:35 -0500",
    "summary": "Comcast is spinning off into a new company many of its cable television networks that were once at the heart of the entertainment giant, as consumers increasingly swap out their cable TV subscriptions for streaming platforms",
    "story": [
      "Comcast is spinning off into a new company many of its cable television networks that were once at the heart of the entertainment giant, as consumers increasingly swap out their cable TV subscriptions for streaming platforms",
      "WASHINGTON -- Comcast is spinning off into a new company many of the cable television networks that were once at the entertainment giant's heart as consumers increasingly swap out their cable TV subscriptions for streaming platforms.",
      "Those one-time stars for Comcast's NBCUniversal cable television networks include USA, Oxygen, E!, SYFY and Golf Channel, as well as CNBC and MSNBC. Movie ticketing platform Fandango and the Rotten Tomatoes movie rating site will also become part of the new company.",
      "Streaming service Peacock will remain with Comcast, as will Bravo, which provides significant content for the Peacock streaming service, and other assets like the NBCUniversal's studios and theme parks.",
      "Comcast telegraphed the shift last month, before confirming Wednesday that it will spin off assets that generated about $7 billion in revenue over the past 12 months ending Sept. 30. That\u2019s about 5.5% of Comcast\u2019s total revenue during that period, according to the company.",
      "How exactly this split will impact customers is not yet clear. Experts maintain it\u2019s too early to tell, given that Comcast aims to complete the transition over the next year.",
      "Some analysts speculate that the spun-off networks may have more freedom to bring their content elsewhere. That could mean you'll have more options to find and curate what you want to watch and where \u2014 or headaches from juggling several different subscriptions in an already-fractured media landscape.",
      "Wednesday's announcement arrives as more and more people \u201ccut the cord\u201d on cable, with millions canceling service subscriptions every year \u2014 and instead signing up for streaming platforms.",
      "Paul Verna, principal analyst and vice president of content for market research company eMarketer, said Comcast\u2019s decision to divest itself from most of its cable TV channels is a reflection of that trend.",
      "\u201cThe writing is on the wall that the cable TV business is a dwindling business,\u201d Verna said. \u201cThat\u2019s why Comcast did what it did today.\u201d",
      "Mike Proulx, a vice president and research director of Forrester, added that the spin-off marks \u201csimply a reconciliation of assets that detract from the company\u2019s inevitable all streaming future.\u201d",
      "Comcast expects the new company, which it referred to as \u201cSpinCo\u201d Wednesday, to have the financial flexibility to be \u201ca potential partner and acquirer of other complementary media businesses.\u201d And Mark Lazarus, the current chairman of NBCUniversal Media Group who will serve as the new entity\u2019s CEO, said Wednesday that the standalone company \u201cwill be better positioned to serve our audiences and drive shareholder returns.\u201d",
      "Like other cable companies, Comcast in recent years has shifted its business emphasis away from traditional cable toward streaming and other sources of revenue, such as its movie studio, theme parks and home wireless and internet services.",
      "Despite a slightly confusing, glitchy start, Peacock has been one of the company's biggest success stories, with recent boosts gained in part by the streaming platform's popularity during the 2024 Paris Olympic Games. In its most recent quarter, Comcast reported that paid Peacock subscribers jumped by 3 million, or 29%, to 36 million subscribers. Peacock\u2019s revenue soared 82% to $1.5 billion in the period.",
      "Dropping \u201cmoney-losing assets\u201d to instead focus on these kinds of lucrative business is clearly beneficial to Comcast, Verna said \u2014 but the future of a new company housing primarily cable networks is less promising. He said he finds it hard \u201cto envision that this company will stay independent for a long time,\" predicting future consolidation of the networks or acquisitions through private equity.",
      "Howard Gutman, private equity strategy and coverage lead for MorganFranklin Consulting, also expects consolidation to be in the cards. He noted the spin-off might entice bigger streaming services that are in search of more content, for example, to buy up these kinds of assets.",
      "That could mean watchers of the Golf Channel, for example, finding its content on what were once rival platforms. But the spun-off assets might also find more power to focus on priorities specific to them under a smaller company umbrella, Gutman added. That would potentially open the door for networks like CNBC to further monetize its own content or expand its brand.",
      "\u201cI think it will open up opportunities,\u201d he said, adding that customers will also have more options to curate subscriptions based on what interests them the most.",

      "Distant, ancient galaxies are giving scientists more hints that a mysterious force called dark energy may not be what they thought",
      "NEW YORK -- Distant, ancient galaxies are giving scientists more hints that a mysterious force called dark energy may not be what they thought.",
      "Astronomers know that the universe is being pushed apart at an accelerating rate and they have puzzled for decades over what could possibly be speeding everything up. They theorize that a powerful, constant force is at play, one that fits nicely with the main mathematical model that describes how the universe behaves. But they can't see it and they don't know where it comes from, so they call it dark energy.",
      "It is so vast it is thought to make up nearly 70% of the universe \u2014 while ordinary matter like all the stars and planets and people make up just 5%.",
      "But findings published earlier this year by an international research collaboration of more than 900 scientists from around the globe yielded a major surprise. As the scientists analyzed how galaxies move they found that the force pushing or pulling them around did not seem to be constant. And the same group published a new, broader set of analyses Tuesday that yielded a similar answer.",
      "\u201cI did not think that such a result would happen in my lifetime,\u201d said Mustapha Ishak-Boushaki, a cosmologist at the University of Texas at Dallas who is part of the collaboration.",
      "Called the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument, it uses a telescope southwest of Tucson, Arizona to create a three-dimensional map of the universe over 11 billion years to see how galaxies have clustered throughout time and across space. That gives scientists information about how the universe evolved, and where it might be heading.",
      "The map they are building would not make sense if dark energy were a constant force, as it is theorized. Instead, the energy appears to be changing or weakening over time. If that is indeed the case, it would upend astronomers' standard cosmological model. It could mean that dark energy is very different than what scientists thought \u2014 or that there may be something else altogether going on.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a time of great excitement, and also some head-scratching and confusion,\u201d said Bhuvnesh Jain, a cosmologist at the University of Pennsylvania who is not involved with the research.",
      "The collaboration's latest finding points to a possible explanation from an older theory: that across billions of years of cosmic history, the universe expanded and galaxies clustered as Einstein's general relativity predicted.",
      "The new findings aren't definitive. Astronomers say they need more data to overturn a theory that seemed to fit together so well. They hope observations from other telescopes and new analyses of the new data over the next few years will determine whether the current view of dark energy stands or falls.",
      "\u201cThe significance of this result right now is tantalizing,\u201d said Robert Caldwell, a physicist at Dartmouth College who is not involved with the research, \"but it's not like a gold-plated measurement.\"",
      "There\u2019s a lot riding on the answer. Because dark energy is the biggest component of the universe, its behavior determines the universe\u2019s fate, explained David Spergel, an astrophysicist and president of the Simons Foundation. If dark energy is constant, the universe will continue to expand, forever getting colder and emptier. If it\u2019s growing in strength, the universe will expand so speedily that it\u2019ll destroy itself in what astronomers call the Big Rip.",
      "\u201cNot to panic. If this is what\u2019s going on, it won\u2019t happen for billions of years,\" he said. \u201cBut we'd like to know about it.\u201d",
      "\u2014\u2014",
      "This story was first published on Nov. 19, 2024. It was updated on Nov. 20, 2024 to correct the location of the telescope used by the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument. It is southwest of Tucson, Arizona, not in Tucson. It also corrects the description of the instrument's three-dimensional map of the universe. The telescope mapped how the universe evolved over 11 billion years, but the universe is about 13.7 billion years old.",

      "Child welfare and internet experts have raised concerns about the ban, including isolating 14- and 15-year-olds from their already established online social networks.",
      "Rowland said there would not be age restrictions placed on messaging services, online games or platforms that substantially support the health and education of users.",
      "\u201cWe are not saying risks don\u2019t exist on messaging apps or online gaming. While users can still be exposed to harmful content by other users, they do not face the same algorithmic curation of content and psychological manipulation to encourage near-endless engagement,\u201d she said.",

      "Mary Louis' excitement to move into an apartment in Massachusetts in the spring of 2021 turned to dismay when Louis, a Black woman, received an email saying that a \u201cthird-party service\u201d had denied her tenancy.",
      "That third-party service included an algorithm designed to score rental applicants, which became the subject of a class action lawsuit, with Louis at the helm, alleging that the algorithm discriminated on the basis of race and income.",
      "A federal judge approved a settlement in the lawsuit, one of the first of it's kind, on Wednesday, with the company behind the algorithm agreeing to pay over $2.2 million and roll back certain parts of it's screening products that the lawsuit alleged were discriminatory.",
      "The settlement does not include any admissions of fault by the company SafeRent Solutions, which said in a statement that while it \u201ccontinues to believe the SRS Scores comply with all applicable laws, litigation is time-consuming and expensive.\"",
      "While such lawsuits might be relatively new, the use of algorithms or artificial intelligence programs to screen or score Americans isn't. For years, AI has been furtively helping make consequential decisions for U.S. residents.",
      "When a person submits a job application, applies for a home loan or even seeks certain medical care, there\u2019s a chance that an AI system or algorithm is scoring or assessing them like it did Louis. Those AI systems, however, are largely unregulated, even though some have been found to discriminate.",
      "\u201cManagement companies and landlords need to know that they\u2019re now on notice, that these systems that they are assuming are reliable and good are going to be challenged,\u201d said Todd Kaplan, one of Louis\u2019 attorneys.",
      "The lawsuit alleged SafeRent's algorithm didn't take into account the benefits of housing vouchers, which they said was an important detail for a renter's ability to pay the monthly bill, and it therefore discriminated against low-income applicants who qualified for the aid.",
      "The suit also accused SafeRent's algorithm of relying too much on credit information. They argued that it fails to give a full picture of an applicant's ability to pay rent on time and unfairly dings applicants with housing vouchers who are Black and Hispanic partly because they have lower median credit scores, attributable to historical inequities.",
      "Christine Webber, one of the plaintiff's attorneys, said that just because an algorithm or AI is not programmed to discriminate, the data an algorithm uses or weights could have \"the same effect as if you told it to discriminate intentionally.\u201d",
      "When Louis' application was denied, she tried appealing the decision, sending two landlords' references to show she\u2019d paid rent early or on time for 16 years, even if she didn't have a strong credit history.",
      "Louis, who had a housing voucher, was scrambling, having already given notice to her previous landlord that she was moving out, and she was charged with taking care of her granddaughter.",
      "The response from the management company, which used SafeRent's screening service, read, \u201cWe do not accept appeals and cannot override the outcome of the Tenant Screening.\u201d",
      "Louis felt defeated; the algorithm didn\u2019t know her, she said.",
      "\u201cEverything is based on numbers. You don\u2019t get the individual empathy from them,\u201d said Louis. \"There is no beating the system. The system is always going to beat us.\u201d",
      "While state lawmakers have proposed aggressive regulations for these types of AI systems, the proposals have largely failed to get enough support. That means lawsuits like Louis\u2019 are starting to lay the groundwork for AI accountability.",
      "SafeRent\u2019s defense attorneys argued in a motion to dismiss that the company shouldn\u2019t be held liable for discrimination because SafeRent wasn\u2019t making the final decision on whether to accept or deny a tenant. The service would screen applicants, score them and submit a report, but leave it to landlords or management companies to accept or deny a tenant.",
      "Louis\u2019 attorneys, along with the U.S. Department of Justice, which submitted a statement of interest in the case, argued that SafeRent\u2019s algorithm could be held accountable because it still plays a role in access to housing. The judge denied SafeRent's motion to dismiss on those counts.",
      "The settlement stipulates that SafeRent can't include its score feature on its tenant screening reports in certain cases, including if the applicant is using a housing voucher. It also requires that if SafeRent develops another screening score it plans to use, it must be validated by a third-party that the plaintiffs agree to.",
      "Louis' son found an affordable apartment for her on Facebook Marketplace that she has since moved into, though it was $200 more expensive and in a less desirable area.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not optimistic that I\u2019m going to catch a break, but I have to keep on keeping, that\u2019s it,\u201d said Louis. \u201cI have too many people who rely on me.\u201d",

    "title": "US regulators seek to break up Google, forcing Chrome sale as part of monopoly punishment",
    "published": "Thu, 21 Nov 2024 02:34:08 -0500",
    "summary": "Regulators want a judge to break up Google to stop it squashing competition.",
    "story": [
      "Regulators want a judge to break up Google to stop it squashing competition.",
      "U.S. regulators want a federal judge to break up Google to prevent the company from continuing to squash competition through its dominant search engine after a court found it had maintained an abusive monopoly over the past decade.",
      "The proposed breakup floated in a 23-page document filed late Wednesday by the U.S. Department of Justice calls for sweeping punishments that would include a sale of Google's industry-leading Chrome web browser and impose restrictions to prevent Android from favoring its own search engine.",
      "A sale of Chrome \u201cwill permanently stop Google\u2019s control of this critical search access point and allow rival search engines the ability to access the browser that for many users is a gateway to the internet,\u201d Justice Department lawyers argued in their filing.",
      "Although regulators stopped short of demanding Google sell Android too, they asserted the judge should make it clear the company could still be required to divest its smartphone operating system if its oversight committee continues to see evidence of misconduct.",
      "The broad scope of the recommended penalties underscores how severely regulators operating under President Joe Biden's administration believe Google should be punished following an August ruling by U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta that branded the company as a monopolist.",
      "The Justice Department decision-makers who will inherit the case after President-elect Donald Trump takes office next year might not be as strident. The Washington, D.C. court hearings on Google's punishment are scheduled to begin in April and Mehta is aiming to issue his final decision before Labor Day.",
      "If Mehta embraces the government's recommendations, Google would be forced to sell its 16-year-old Chrome browser within six months of the final ruling. But the company certainly would appeal any punishment, potentially prolonging a legal tussle that has dragged on for more than four years.",
      "Besides seeking a Chrome spinoff and a corralling of the Android software, the Justice Department wants the judge to ban Google from forging multibillion-dollar deals to lock in its dominant search engine as the default option on Apple\u2019s iPhone and other devices. It would also ban Google from favoring its own services, such as YouTube or its recently-launched artificial intelligence platform, Gemini.",
      "Regulators also want Google to license the search index data it collects from people\u2019s queries to its rivals, giving them a better chance at competing with the tech giant. On the commercial side of its search engine, Google would be required to provide more transparency into how it sets the prices that advertisers pay to be listed near the top of some targeted search results.",
      "Kent Walker, Google\u2019s chief legal officer, lashed out at the Justice Department for pursuing \u201ca radical interventionist agenda that would harm Americans and America\u2019s global technology.\u201d In a blog post, Walker warned the \u201coverly broad proposal\u201d would threaten personal privacy while undermining Google\u2019s early leadership in artificial intelligence, \u201cperhaps the most important innovation of our time.\u201d",
      "Wary of Google\u2019s increasing use of artificial intelligence in its search results, regulators also advised Mehta to ensure websites will be able to shield their content from Google\u2019s AI training techniques.",
      "The measures, if they are ordered, threaten to upend a business expected to generate more than $300 billion in revenue this year.",
      "\u201cThe playing field is not level because of Google\u2019s conduct, and Google\u2019s quality reflects the ill-gotten gains of an advantage illegally acquired,\u201d the Justice Department asserted in its recommendations. \u201cThe remedy must close this gap and deprive Google of these advantages.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s still possible that the Justice Department could ease off attempts to break up Google, especially if Trump takes the widely expected step of replacing Assistant Attorney General Jonathan Kanter, who was appointed by Biden to oversee the agency's antitrust division.",
      "Although the case targeting Google was originally filed during the final months of Trump\u2019s first term in office, Kanter oversaw the high-profile trial that culminated in Mehta's ruling against Google. Working in tandem with Federal Trade Commission Chair Lina Khan, Kanter took a get-tough stance against Big Tech that triggered other attempted crackdowns on industry powerhouses such as Apple and discouraged many business deals from getting done during the past four years.",
      "Trump recently expressed concerns that a breakup might destroy Google but didn\u2019t elaborate on alternative penalties he might have in mind. \u201cWhat you can do without breaking it up is make sure it\u2019s more fair,\u201d Trump said last month. Matt Gaetz, the former Republican congressman that Trump nominated to be the next U.S. Attorney General, has previously called for the breakup of Big Tech companies.",
      "Gaetz faces a tough confirmation hearing.",
      "This latest filing gave Kanter and his team a final chance to spell out measures that they believe are needed to restore competition in search. It comes six weeks after Justice first floated the idea of a breakup in a preliminary outline of potential penalties.",
      "But Kanter's proposal is already raising questions about whether regulators seek to impose controls that extend beyond the issues covered in last year\u2019s trial, and \u2014 by extension \u2014 Mehta\u2019s ruling.",
      "Banning the default search deals that Google now pays more than $26 billion annually to maintain was one of the main practices that troubled Mehta in his ruling.",
      "It's less clear whether the judge will embrace the Justice Department\u2019s contention that Chrome needs to be spun out of Google and or Android should be completely walled off from its search engine.",
      "\u201cIt is probably going a little beyond,\u201d Syracuse University law professor Shubha Ghosh said of the Chrome breakup. \u201cThe remedies should match the harm, it should match the transgression. This does seem a little beyond that pale.\u201d",
      "Google rival DuckDuckGo, whose executives testified during last year's trial, asserted the Justice Department is simply doing what needs to be done to rein in a brazen monopolist.",
      "\u201cUndoing Google\u2019s overlapping and widespread illegal conduct over more than a decade requires more than contract restrictions: it requires a range of remedies to create enduring competition,\u201d Kamyl Bazbaz, DuckDuckGo's senior vice president of public affairs, said in a statement.",
      "Trying to break up Google harks back to a similar punishment initially imposed on Microsoft a quarter century ago following another major antitrust trial that culminated in a federal judge deciding the software maker had illegally used his Windows operating system for PCs to stifle competition.",
      "However, an appeals court overturned an order that would have broken up Microsoft, a precedent many experts believe will make Mehta reluctant to go down a similar road with the Google case.",

      "A report released Monday by Pew Research Center says about one in five Americans regularly get their news from so-called news influencers on social media",
      "About one in five Americans \u2013 and a virtually identical share of Republicans and Democrats \u2013 regularly get their news from digital influencers who are more likely to be found on the social media platform X, according to a report released Monday by the Pew Research Center.",
      "The findings, drawn from a survey of more than 10,000 U.S. adults and an analysis of social media posts posted this summer by influencers, provide an indication of how Americans consumed the news during the height of the U.S. presidential campaign that President-elect Donald Trump ultimately won.",
      "The study examined accounts run by people who post and talk regularly about current events - including through podcasts and newsletters - and have more than 100,000 followers on Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, X or TikTok. They include people across the political spectrum, such as the progressive podcast host Brian Tyler Cohen and conservative podcaster Ben Shapiro, as well as non-partisan personalities like Chris Cillizza, a former CNN analyst who now runs his own newsletter.",
      "The report found that news influencers posted mostly about politics and the election, followed by social issues like race and abortion and international events, such as the Israel-Hamas war. Most of them \u2013 63% - are men and the majority \u2013 77% - have no affiliation, or background, with a media organization. Pew said about half of the influencers it sampled did not express a clear political orientation. From the ones that did, slightly more of them identified as conservative than as liberal.",
      "During the campaign, both parties and presidential campaigns had courted influencers, including creators who weren't very political, to compete for voters who are increasingly getting most of their news from non-traditional sources.",
      "The Republican and Democratic national conventions had credentialed influencers to cover their events this past summer. Vice President Kamala Harris sat down with Alex Cooper for her \u201cCall Her Daddy\u201d podcast and talked a little Bay Area basketball with the fellows on \u201cAll the Smoke.\u201d Meanwhile, Trump hung out with the bros on the \u201cBussin\u2019 With the Boys,\u201d \u201cFlagrant\u201d and the popular podcaster Joe Rogan as part of a series of appearances targeting young male voters.",
      "\u201cThese influencers have really reached new levels of attention and prominence this year amid the presidential election,\u201d Galen Stocking, senior computational social scientist at Pew Research Center, said in a statement. \u201cWe thought it was really important to look at who is behind some of the most popular accounts \u2013 the ones that aren\u2019t news organizations, but actual people.\u201d",
      "Even though 85% of news influencers have a presence on X, many of them also have homes on other social media platforms, such as Facebook, Instagram, YouTube and TikTok.",
      "Racial minorities, young adults and adults with a lower income were more likely to get their news from news influencers, according to the report. Most of the people surveyed by Pew said news influencers have helped them better understand current events, while roughly a quarter say what they hear has not made much of a difference. A small share \u2014 9% \u2014 say influencers have confused them more.",
      "Media analysts have long been concerned about how influencers - most of whom don't have to abide by editorial standards - could fuel misinformation, or even be used by America's adversaries to churn out content that fits their interests. On social media, though, some influencers have positioned themselves as figures presenting neglected points of view.",
      "Pew, which is doing the study as part of an initiative funded by the Knight Foundation, said 70% of the survey respondents believe the news they get from influencers is somewhat different than what they hear elsewhere. Roughly a quarter said it was \u201cextremely or very different.\u201d",
      "The report found TikTok is the only one of the major platforms where influencers who identify as right-leaning do not outnumber those who are more liberal. Pew said news influencers on the short-form video app were more likely than those on other sites to show support for LGBTQ+ rights or identify as part of the LGBTQ+ community. The platform also had the smallest gender gap for news influencers.",

      "A New Hampshire company is working to develop a fleet of autonomous helicopters that it hopes can be used to put out fires, spray crops and handle other dangerous jobs",
      "HENNIKER, N.H. -- When Hector Xu was learning to fly a helicopter in college, he recalled having a few \u201cnasty experiences\u201d while trying to navigate at night.",
      "The heart-stopping flights led to his research of unmanned aircraft systems while getting his doctorate degree in aerospace engineering at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Then, he formed Rotor Technologies in 2021 to develop unmanned helicopters.",
      "Rotor has built two autonomous Sprayhawks and aims to have as many as 20 ready for market next year. The company also is developing helicopters that would carry cargo in disaster zones and to offshore oil rigs. The helicopter could also be used to fight wildfires.",
      "For now, Rotor is focused on the agriculture sector, which has embraced automation with drones but sees unmanned helicopters as a better way to spray larger areas with pesticides and fertilizers.",
      "On Wednesday, Rotor plans to conduct a public flight test with its Sprayhawk at an agriculture aviation trade show in Texas.",
      "\u201cPeople would call us up and say, \u2018hey, I want to use this for crop dusting, can I?\u2019 We\u2019d say, OK maybe,\u201d Xu said, adding that they got enough calls to realize it was a huge untapped market. The Associated Press reporters were the first people outside the company to witness a test flight of the Sprayhawk. It hovered, flew forward and sprayed the tarmac before landing.",
      "Rotor's nearly $1 million Sprayhawk helicopter is a Robinson R44, but the four seats have been replaced with flight computers and communications systems allowing it be operated remotely. It has five cameras as well as laser-sensing technology and a radar altimeter that make terrain reading more accurate along with GPS and motion sensors.",
      "At the company's hangar in Nashua, New Hampshire, Xu said this technology means there is better visibility of terrain at night.",
      "One of the big draws of automation in agriculture aviation is safety.",
      "Because crop dusters fly at around 150 mph (240 kph) and only about 10 feet (3 meters) off the ground, there are dozens of accidents each year when planes collide with power lines, cell towers and other planes. Older, poorly maintained planes and pilot fatigue contribute to accidents.",
      "A 2014 report from the National Transportation Safety Board found there were more than 800 agriculture operation accidents between 2001 and 2010 including 81 that were fatal. A separate report from the National Agriculture Aviation Association found nearly 640 accidents from 2014 until this month with 109 fatalities.",
      "\u201cIt is a very, very dangerous, profession and there are multiple fatalities every year,\u201d said Dan Martin, a research engineer with the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Agriculture Research Service. \u201cThey make all their money in those short few months so sometimes it may mean that they fly 10 to 12 hours a day or more.\u201d",
      "Job hazards also include exposure to chemicals.",
      "In recent years, safety concerns and the cheaper cost has led to a proliferation of drones flying above farmers' fields, Martin said, adding that some 10,000 will likely be sold this year alone.",
      "\u201cIt's growing exponentially as a market, super fast,\u201d Martin said.",
      "But the size of the drones and their limited battery power means they only can cover a fraction of the area of a plane and helicopters. That is providing an opening for companies building bigger unmanned aircraft like Rotor and another company Pyka.",
      "California-based Pyka announced in August that it had sold its first autonomous electric aircraft for crop protection to a customer in the United States. Pyka's Pelican Spray, a fixed-wing aircraft, received FAA approval last year to fly commercially for crop protection. The company also sold its Pelican Spray to Dole for use in Honduras and to the Brazilian company, SLC Agr\u00edcola.",
      "Lukas Koch, chief technology officer at Heinen Brothers Agra Services, the company which bought the Pelican Spray in August, has called unmanned aircraft part of a coming \u201crevolution,\" that will save farmers money and improve safety.",
      "The Kansas-based company operates out of airports from Texas to Illinois. Koch doesn't envision the unmanned aircraft replacing all the the company's dozens of pilots but rather taking over the riskiest jobs.",
      "\u201cThe biggest draw is taking the pilot out of the aircraft inside of those most dangerous situations,\u201d Koch said. \u201cThere\u2019s still fields that are surrounded by trees on all borders, or you\u2019ve got big, large power lines or other just dangers, wind turbines, things like that. It can be tough to fly around.\u201d",
      "But Koch acknowledges autonomous aviation systems could introduce new dangers to an already chaotic airspace \u2014 though that is less of a concern in rural areas with plenty of open space and fewer people.",
      "\u201cPutting more systems into the air that don\u2019t have a pilot inside could introduce new dangers to our current existing pilots and make their life even more dangerous,\" he said. \u201cIf you\u2019ve got this full size helicopter flying beyond the line of sight, how is it going to react when it sees you? What is it going to do? ... That's a giant question mark, one that we take very seriously.\u201d",
      "Companies like Rotor have incorporated built-in in contingencies should something go wrong \u2014 its helicopter features a half-dozen communications systems and, for now, a remote pilot in control.",
      "If the ground team loses contact with the helicopter, Rotor has a system which Xu referred to as a big, red button that ensures the engine can be shut off and the helicopter perform a controlled landing. \u201cThat means that we\u2019ll never have an aircraft fly away event,\" he said.",
      "The safety measures will go a long way to helping the company receive what it expects will be FAA regulatory approval to fly its helicopters commercially. Once they have that, the challenge, as Xu sees it, will be scaling up to meet the demand in the United States but also Brazil which has a huge agriculture market but more relaxed regulatory environment.",
      "\u201cI think 2025 will be production hell as Elon Musk calls it,\u201d Xu said. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of the difference between building a couple to building tens and hundreds at scale ... These are no longer just like bespoke Rolls-Royces. You want to be stamping these out like you would production automobiles.\""

      "SpaceX has launched another Starship rocket, but passed up catching it with giant mechanical arms",
      "SpaceX on Tuesday launched another Starship rocket, but passed up catching the booster with giant mechanical arms.",
      "Unlike last month\u2019s success, the booster was directed to a splashdown in the Gulf of Mexico. The catch was called off just four minutes into the test flight from Texas for safety reasons, and the booster hit the water three minutes later.",
      "SpaceX's Elon Musk said Wednesday via X that the booster catch was aborted due to lost communication with a launch tower computer.",
      "At the same time, the empty spacecraft launched from Texas atop Starship soared across the Gulf of Mexico on a near loop around the world similar to October\u2019s test flight. Skimming space, the shiny retro-looking craft descended into the Indian Ocean for a controlled but destructive end to the hourlong demo.",
      "It was the sixth test for the world\u2019s biggest and most powerful rocket that SpaceX and NASA hope to use to get astronauts back on the moon and eventually Mars.",
      "SpaceX kept the same flight path as last time, but changed some steps along the way as well as the time of day. Starship blasted off in late afternoon instead of early morning to ensure daylight to see the spacecraft\u2019s descent.",
      "Among the new objectives that were achieved: igniting one of the spacecraft\u2019s engines in space, which would be necessary when returning from orbit. There were also thermal protection experiments aboard the spacecraft, with some areas stripped of heat tiles to see whether catch mechanisms might work there on future flights. And the spacecraft descended nose-first during the last part of entry, before flipping and splashing down upright into the Indian Ocean. Even more upgrades are planned for the next test flight.",
      "Donald Trump flew in for the launch in the latest sign of a deepening bond between the president-elect and Musk, SpaceX's founder and CEO.",
      "SpaceX wants to eventually return and reuse the entire 400-foot (121-meter) Starship. Full-scale recycling would drive down the cost of hauling cargo and people to the moon and Mars, while speeding things up. The recycling of SpaceX\u2019s Falcon rockets flying out of Florida and California has already saved the company time and money.",
      "NASA is paying SpaceX more than $4 billion to land astronauts on the moon via Starship on back-to-back missions later this decade. Musk envisions launching a fleet of Starships to build a city one day on Mars.",

      "Building the current crop of artificial intelligence chatbots has relied on specialized computer chips pioneered by Nvidia, which dominates the market and made itself the poster child of the AI boom",
      "SANTA CLARA, Calif. -- Building the current crop of artificial intelligence chatbots has relied on specialized computer chips pioneered by Nvidia, which dominates the market and made itself the poster child of the AI boom.",
      "But the same qualities that make those graphics processor chips, or GPUs, so effective at creating powerful AI systems from scratch make them less efficient at putting AI products to work.",
      "That's opened up the AI chip industry to rivals who think they can compete with Nvidia in selling so-called AI inference chips that are more attuned to the day-to-day running of AI tools and designed to reduce some of the huge computing costs of generative AI.",
      "\u201cThese companies are seeing opportunity for that kind of specialized hardware,\u201d said Jacob Feldgoise, an analyst at Georgetown University's Center for Security and Emerging Technology. \u201cThe broader the adoption of these models, the more compute will be needed for inference and the more demand there will be for inference chips.\u201d",
      "It takes a lot of computing power to make an AI chatbot. It starts with a process called training or pretraining \u2014 the \u201cP\u201d in ChatGPT \u2014 that involves AI systems \u201clearning\u201d from the patterns of huge troves of data. GPUs are good at doing that work because they can run many calculations at a time on a network of devices in communication with each other.",
      "However, once trained, a generative AI tool still needs chips to do the work \u2014 such as when you ask a chatbot to compose a document or generate an image. That's where inferencing comes in. A trained AI model must take in new information and make inferences from what it already knows to produce a response.",
      "GPUs can do that work, too. But it can be a bit like taking a sledgehammer to crack a nut.",
      "\u201cWith training, you\u2019re doing a lot heavier, a lot more work. With inferencing, that\u2019s a lighter weight,\u201d said Forrester analyst Alvin Nguyen.",
      "That's led startups like Cerebras, Groq and d-Matrix as well as Nvidia's traditional chipmaking rivals \u2014 such as AMD and Intel \u2014 to pitch more inference-friendly chips as Nvidia focuses on meeting the huge demand from bigger tech companies for its higher-end hardware.",
      "D-Matrix, which is launching its first product this week, was founded in 2019 \u2014 a bit late to the AI chip game, as CEO Sid Sheth explained during a recent interview at the company\u2019s headquarters in Santa Clara, California, the same Silicon Valley city that's also home to AMD, Intel and Nvidia.",
      "\u201cThere were already 100-plus companies. So when we went out there, the first reaction we got was \u2018you\u2019re too late,\u2019\u201d he said. The pandemic's arrival six months later didn't help as the tech industry pivoted to a focus on software to serve remote work.",
      "Now, however, Sheth sees a big market in AI inferencing, comparing that later stage of machine learning to how human beings apply the knowledge they acquired in school.",
      "\u201cWe spent the first 20 years of our lives going to school, educating ourselves. That\u2019s training, right?\u201d he said. \u201cAnd then the next 40 years of your life, you kind of go out there and apply that knowledge \u2014 and then you get rewarded for being efficient.\u201d",
      "The product, called Corsair, consists of two chips with four chiplets each, made by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company \u2014 the same manufacturer of most of Nvidia's chips \u2014 and packaged together in a way that helps to keep them cool.",
      "The chips are designed in Santa Clara, assembled in Taiwan and then tested back in California. Testing is a long process and can take six months \u2014 if anything is off, it can be sent back to Taiwan.",
      "D-Matrix workers were doing final testing on the chips during a recent visit to a laboratory with blue metal desks covered with cables, motherboards and computers, with a cold server room next door.",
      "While tech giants like Amazon, Google, Meta and Microsoft have been gobbling up the supply of costly GPUs in a race to outdo each other in AI development, makers of AI inference chips are aiming for a broader clientele.",
      "Forrester's Nguyen said that could include Fortune 500 companies that want to make use of new generative AI technology without having to build their own AI infrastructure. Sheth said he expects a strong interest in AI video generation.",
      "\u201cThe dream of AI for a lot of these enterprise companies is you can use your own enterprise data,\u201d Nguyen said. \u201cBuying (AI inference chips) should be cheaper than buying the ultimate GPUs from Nvidia and others. But I think there\u2019s going to be a learning curve in terms of integrating it.\u201d",
      "Feldgoise said that, unlike training-focused chips, AI inference work prioritizes how fast a person will get a chatbot's response.",
      "He said another whole set of companies is developing AI hardware for inference that can run not just in big data centers but locally on desktop computers, laptops and phones.",
      "Better-designed chips could bring down the huge costs of running AI to businesses. That could also affect the environmental and energy costs for everyone else.",
      "Sheth says the big concern right now is, \u201care we going to burn the planet down in our quest for what people call AGI \u2014 human-like intelligence?\u201d",
      "It\u2019s still fuzzy when AI might get to the point of artificial general intelligence \u2014 predictions range from a few years to decades. But, Sheth notes, only a handful of tech giants are on that quest.",
      "\u201cBut then what about the rest?\u201d he said. \u201cThey cannot be put on the same path.\u201d",
      "The other set of companies don\u2019t want to use very large AI models \u2014 it\u2019s too costly and uses too much energy.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know if people truly, really appreciate that inference is actually really going to be a much bigger opportunity than training. I don\u2019t think they appreciate that. It\u2019s still training that is really grabbing all the headlines,\u201d Sheth said.",

    "story": [
      "A federal bankruptcy judge in Texas is being asked to disqualify a winning bid made by the satirical news outlet The Onion to buy conspiracy theorist Alex Jones' Infowars",
      "A company affiliated with conspiracy theorist Alex Jones asked a federal judge on Monday to disqualify a bid by the satirical news outlet The Onion to buy Jones' Infowars at a bankruptcy auction, alleging fraud and collusion.",
      "The company, First United American Companies, which is affiliated with a Jones website that sells dietary supplements, was the only other bidder at the recent auction, offering $3.5 million. In a filing in federal bankruptcy court in Houston, a lawyer for the company asked the judge to declare it the winning bidder instead of The Onion.",
      "The lawyer, Walter Cicack, claimed that the bankruptcy trustee overseeing the auction improperly colluded with The Onion and families of victims of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in Connecticut in naming The Onion the winning bidder. Cicack also alleged the trustee violated rules for the sale set by the judge, and said the company's cash offer was twice the amount of The Onion's.",
      "The bankruptcy auction was held last week as part of the liquidation of Jones\u2019 assets, including Infowars. Proceeds from the sale will go to Sandy Hook families and other creditors. Jones filed bankruptcy in 2022 after he was ordered to pay nearly $1.5 billion in defamation lawsuits filed by the families for calling the 2012 shooting that killed 20 children and six educators a hoax staged by actors to increase gun control.",
      "Ben Collins, CEO of The Onion\u2019s parent company, Chicago-based Global Tetrahedron, issued a statement Monday through a spokesperson.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re obviously disappointed he\u2019s lashing out by creating conspiracies, but we\u2019re also not surprised,\u201d he said, referring to Jones.",
      "The bankruptcy trustee appointed to oversee the sale, Christopher Murray, declined to comment Monday. A lawyer for the Sandy Hook families, Christopher Mattei, also declined to comment.",
      "In a response filed in court later Monday, Murray called the allegations \u201cbaseless.\u201d He said the motion by First United American to disqualify The Onion was \u201ca disappointed bidder\u2019s improper attempt to influence an otherwise fair and open auction process.\u201d",
      "Murray also wrote, \u201cHaving failed in its prior efforts to bully the Trustee and his advisors into accepting its inferior bid, FUAC now alleges, without evidence, collusion and bad faith in an attempt to mislead the Court and disqualify its only competition in the auction.\u201d",
      "Murray filed separate court papers Monday asking the judge to approve the sale of Infowars to The Onion.",
      "Monday's filing by First United American Companies included the formal bid submitted by The Onion, revealing that it offered $1.75 million for Infowars along with certain incentives by Sandy Hook families who won their defamation lawsuit against Jones. The families agreed to forgo up to 100% of their share of the Infowars sale proceeds and give it to other Jones creditors.",
      "With the families' offer, other Jones creditors would get a total of $100,000 more than they would get if First United American Companies bought Infowars, according to The Onion's bidding document.",
      "Murray told the bankruptcy judge during a court hearing Thursday that the families' incentives made it a better offer than the one by the Jones-affiliated company.",
      "\u201cThe creditors ended up significantly better off,\u201d Murray told the judge, adding that one of his responsibilities was to maximize value for creditors.",
      "Judge Christopher Lopez, who said he had questions about the sale process and concerns about transparency, ordered a hearing to see exactly what happened with the auction and how the trustee chose The Onion. The date of the hearing has not been set.",
      "Jones has been criticizing the sale process on his show and social media sites, calling it \u201crigged\u201d and a \u201cfraud.\u201d",
      "Over the weekend, Collins posted a series of comments about the auction on X, formerly known as Twitter.",
      "\u201cLong and short of it: We won the bid and \u2014 you\u2019re not going to believe it \u2014 the previous InfoWars folks aren\u2019t taking it well,\u201d he wrote.",
      "Collins said last week that The Onion planned to turn the Infowars website into a parody site, taking aim at conspiracy theorists and other social media personalities while promoting gun violence prevention efforts.",
      "Cicack also said in Monday's court filing that the trustee improperly changed the auction process \u201cfrom a live auction to a secret process.\u201d Cicack said that after sealed bids were submitted Nov. 8, it was expected that there would be a round of live bidding on Nov. 13.",
      "But instead, he said, Murray decided to ask the two bidders to submit another offer as their final and best proposal, which they did. Murray then chose from those final bids without holding a round of live bidding. He alleged Murray violated the auction rules.",
      "Lopez's 20-page order on the sale procedures, issued in September, made such a live bidding round optional. And it gave broad authority to Murray to conduct the sale, including the power to reject any bid, no matter how high, that was \u201ccontrary to the best interests\u201d of Jones, his company and their creditors.",
      "Cicack called the Sandy Hook families' portion of The Onion's bid \u201cMonopoly\u201d money with no value.",
      "\u201cIt is also the product of impermissible collusion with the Onion in an effort to \u2018rig\u2019 the auction with the goal of achieving a specific result desired by the Connecticut Families,\u201d he wrote."

      "The major remaining nominees for the role are Bessent, former Federal Reserve board governor Kevin Warsh, Apollo Global Management Chief Executive Marc Rowan, and Tennessee Sen. Bill Hagerty, Trump's former Japan ambassador.",
      "Trump on the campaign trail proposed a 60% tariff on goods from China \u2014 and a tariff of up to 20% on everything else the United States imports. On the campaign trail, Trump portrayed the taxes on imports as both a negotiating tool to hammer out better trade terms and as a way to generate revenue to fund tax cuts elsewhere.",
      "An advocate for imposing wide-ranging tariffs, Lutnick gave full-throated support for Trump's tariffs plan in a CNBC interview in September. \u201cTariffs are an amazing tool for the president to use \u2014 we need to protect the American worker,\" he said.",

      "Lutnick's brother, Gary Lutnick, and 658 of 960 Cantor Fitzgerald employees were killed in the Sept. 11, 2001, attack on the World Trade Center. The firm lost two-thirds of its employees that day. Lutnick is a member of the Board of Directors of the National September 11 Memorial & Museum, the Partnership for New York City.",
      "After Cantor Fitzgerald settled a wrongful death and personal injuries case against American Airlines and insurance carriers in 2013 for $135 million, Lutnick said: \u201cWe could never, and will never, consider it ordinary. For us, there is no way to describe this compromise with inapt words like ordinary, fair or reasonable. All we can say is that the legal formality of this matter is over.\u201d",

      "Lutnick is a proponent of advancing aims of the cryptocurrency industry \u2014 namely, the cryptocurrency Tether.",
      "Cryptocurrencies are forms of digital money that can be traded over the internet without relying on the global banking system. Bitcoin is the most popular cryptocurrency.",
      "\u201cBitcoin is like gold and should be free trade everywhere in the world,\u201d Lutnick said at a bitcoin conference earlier this year. \u201cAnd as the largest wholesaler in the world we\u2019re going to do everything in our power to make it so. Bitcoin should trade the same as gold everywhere in the world without exception and without limitation.\u201d",
      "Trump has taken on a favorable view of cryptocurrencies \u2014 from announcing in May that the campaign would begin accepting donations in cryptocurrency as part of an effort to build what it calls a \u201ccrypto army\u201d leading up to Election Day.

    "title": "US regulators seek to break up Google, forcing Chrome sale as part of monopoly punishment",
    "published": "Thu, 21 Nov 2024 02:34:08 -0500",
    "summary": "Regulators want a judge to break up Google to stop it squashing competition.",
    "story": [
      "Regulators want a judge to break up Google to stop it squashing competition.",
      "U.S. regulators want a federal judge to break up Google to prevent the company from continuing to squash competition through its dominant search engine after a court found it had maintained an abusive monopoly over the past decade.",
      "The proposed breakup floated in a 23-page document filed late Wednesday by the U.S. Department of Justice calls for sweeping punishments that would include a sale of Google's industry-leading Chrome web browser and impose restrictions to prevent Android from favoring its own search engine.",
      "A sale of Chrome \u201cwill permanently stop Google\u2019s control of this critical search access point and allow rival search engines the ability to access the browser that for many users is a gateway to the internet,\u201d Justice Department lawyers argued in their filing.",
      "Although regulators stopped short of demanding Google sell Android too, they asserted the judge should make it clear the company could still be required to divest its smartphone operating system if its oversight committee continues to see evidence of misconduct.",
      "The broad scope of the recommended penalties underscores how severely regulators operating under President Joe Biden's administration believe Google should be punished following an August ruling by U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta that branded the company as a monopolist.",
      "The Justice Department decision-makers who will inherit the case after President-elect Donald Trump takes office next year might not be as strident. The Washington, D.C. court hearings on Google's punishment are scheduled to begin in April and Mehta is aiming to issue his final decision before Labor Day.",
      "If Mehta embraces the government's recommendations, Google would be forced to sell its 16-year-old Chrome browser within six months of the final ruling. But the company certainly would appeal any punishment, potentially prolonging a legal tussle that has dragged on for more than four years.",
      "Besides seeking a Chrome spinoff and a corralling of the Android software, the Justice Department wants the judge to ban Google from forging multibillion-dollar deals to lock in its dominant search engine as the default option on Apple\u2019s iPhone and other devices. It would also ban Google from favoring its own services, such as YouTube or its recently-launched artificial intelligence platform, Gemini.",
      "Regulators also want Google to license the search index data it collects from people\u2019s queries to its rivals, giving them a better chance at competing with the tech giant. On the commercial side of its search engine, Google would be required to provide more transparency into how it sets the prices that advertisers pay to be listed near the top of some targeted search results.",
      "Kent Walker, Google\u2019s chief legal officer, lashed out at the Justice Department for pursuing \u201ca radical interventionist agenda that would harm Americans and America\u2019s global technology.\u201d In a blog post, Walker warned the \u201coverly broad proposal\u201d would threaten personal privacy while undermining Google\u2019s early leadership in artificial intelligence, \u201cperhaps the most important innovation of our time.\u201d",
      "Wary of Google\u2019s increasing use of artificial intelligence in its search results, regulators also advised Mehta to ensure websites will be able to shield their content from Google\u2019s AI training techniques.",
      "The measures, if they are ordered, threaten to upend a business expected to generate more than $300 billion in revenue this year.",
      "\u201cThe playing field is not level because of Google\u2019s conduct, and Google\u2019s quality reflects the ill-gotten gains of an advantage illegally acquired,\u201d the Justice Department asserted in its recommendations. \u201cThe remedy must close this gap and deprive Google of these advantages.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s still possible that the Justice Department could ease off attempts to break up Google, especially if Trump takes the widely expected step of replacing Assistant Attorney General Jonathan Kanter, who was appointed by Biden to oversee the agency's antitrust division.",
      "Although the case targeting Google was originally filed during the final months of Trump\u2019s first term in office, Kanter oversaw the high-profile trial that culminated in Mehta's ruling against Google. Working in tandem with Federal Trade Commission Chair Lina Khan, Kanter took a get-tough stance against Big Tech that triggered other attempted crackdowns on industry powerhouses such as Apple and discouraged many business deals from getting done during the past four years.",
      "Trump recently expressed concerns that a breakup might destroy Google but didn\u2019t elaborate on alternative penalties he might have in mind. \u201cWhat you can do without breaking it up is make sure it\u2019s more fair,\u201d Trump said last month. Matt Gaetz, the former Republican congressman that Trump nominated to be the next U.S. Attorney General, has previously called for the breakup of Big Tech companies.",
      "Gaetz faces a tough confirmation hearing.",
      "This latest filing gave Kanter and his team a final chance to spell out measures that they believe are needed to restore competition in search. It comes six weeks after Justice first floated the idea of a breakup in a preliminary outline of potential penalties.",
      "But Kanter's proposal is already raising questions about whether regulators seek to impose controls that extend beyond the issues covered in last year\u2019s trial, and \u2014 by extension \u2014 Mehta\u2019s ruling.",
      "Banning the default search deals that Google now pays more than $26 billion annually to maintain was one of the main practices that troubled Mehta in his ruling.",
      "It's less clear whether the judge will embrace the Justice Department\u2019s contention that Chrome needs to be spun out of Google and or Android should be completely walled off from its search engine.",
      "\u201cIt is probably going a little beyond,\u201d Syracuse University law professor Shubha Ghosh said of the Chrome breakup. \u201cThe remedies should match the harm, it should match the transgression. This does seem a little beyond that pale.\u201d",
      "Google rival DuckDuckGo, whose executives testified during last year's trial, asserted the Justice Department is simply doing what needs to be done to rein in a brazen monopolist.",
      "\u201cUndoing Google\u2019s overlapping and widespread illegal conduct over more than a decade requires more than contract restrictions: it requires a range of remedies to create enduring competition,\u201d Kamyl Bazbaz, DuckDuckGo's senior vice president of public affairs, said in a statement.",
      "Trying to break up Google harks back to a similar punishment initially imposed on Microsoft a quarter century ago following another major antitrust trial that culminated in a federal judge deciding the software maker had illegally used his Windows operating system for PCs to stifle competition.",
      "However, an appeals court overturned an order that would have broken up Microsoft, a precedent many experts believe will make Mehta reluctant to go down a similar road with the Google case.",

      "The trial against Bryan Kohberger is scheduled for August 2025.",
      "The judge overseeing Bryan Kohberger's murder case has ruled the death penalty will remain on the table as the case moves forward, rejecting a request from Kohberger's defense attorneys.",
      "In June 2023, prosecutors announced they intended to seek the death penalty against the onetime Ph.D. student accused of fatally stabbing four University of Idaho students -- Kaylee Goncalves, 21, Madison Mogen, 21, Xana Kernodle, 20, and Ethan Chapin, 20 -- in November 2022.",
      "This September, lawyers for Kohberger made a sweeping play to get capital punishment tossed out, arguing -- in hundreds of pages of court filings -- that Kohberger's life should not be on the line because, among other things, the death penalty would violate his constitutional rights as well as contemporary standards of decency.",
      "However, in a lengthy filing Wednesday, Judge Steven Hippler ruled against all twelve of Kohberger's motions challenging various aspects of Idaho's capital punishment scheme.",
      "In his 55-page decision Judge Hippler \"concludes relief in [Kohberger's] favor is not warranted on any of the motions.\"",
      "Among other things, defense attorneys had argued that the death penalty is out of step with current social mores. However, the judge ruled \"there is no basis to depart from settled law upholding Idaho's death penalty statute as constitutional,\" and it remains \"consistent with contemporary standards of decency.\"",
      "Defense attorneys also argued that capital punishment should be stricken in this case on the basis of execution methods \u2014 specifically, citing the shortage of lethal injection drugs, and arguing that firing squad executions which, last year, became legal in Idaho are \"cruel and unusual.\" And, they argued, letting their client wait on death row without knowing \"how he will be executed\" is itself an \"unconstitutional\" form of torment.",
      "But the judge again disagreed \u2014 siding with prosecutors that that argument \"is not ripe\" for discussion, because Kohberger hasn't been convicted yet. And, the judge continued, even if it were appropriate to address now, both the firing squad and lethal injection have been found constitutional and are allowed in the state.",
      "The judge also ruled against each of the defense's attempts to strike the aggravating factors prosecutors had found, which made Kohberger eligible for the death penalty.",
      "Kohberger was arrested following a six-week manhunt in December 2022.",
      "A criminology student at nearby Washington State University at the time of the crime, Kohberger was charged with four counts of first-degree murder and one count of burglary.",
      "A not guilty plea was entered on his behalf.",

      "McMahon is a longtime ally of Trump who served as his transition co-chair and the former head of the U.S. Small Business Administration.",
      "Though she is primarily known for founding and leading the WWE, she has had several stints in education -- starting with her nomination to the Connecticut State Board of Education in 2009.",
      "At the confirmation hearing in 2009, she said education was her passion and that her work as CEO of the WWE taught her \"firsthand the skills Connecticut students need to obtain through education to be successful.\"",

      "However, McMahon had written on her board application that she had a degree in education, even though her degree from East Carolina University was in French, according to local reports from that period. Her spokesman at the time called it an \"honest mistake\" in the Connecticut Post.",
      "Regardless, McMahon stepped down from her post on the Connecticut State Board of Education -- and her position as CEO of WWE -- shortly after, in 2010, to run for the U.S. Senate as a Republican.",
      "On her 2010 campaign website, she signaled support for \"competition and choice through charter schools\" and \"secondary school reform\" -- a position that is reflected in her views today.",

      "Oz has previously expressed support for an option that could lead to more Medicare privatization. Although Oz has not revealed his views on Medicaid, some Republicans in Congress have expressed support for changes that would slash the budget of the program.",
      "Making Medicare Advantage the default",
      "CMS\u00a0administers Medicare, the federal health insurance program for those mostly aged 65 and older. More than 66 million people in the U.S. receive coverage through Medicare, the program says.",
      "However, Oz has expressed support for Medicare Advantage, a Medicare-approved plan run by private insurance companies. The plan must follow rules set by Medicare, such as limiting out-of-pocket expenses and covering all services covered by traditional Medicare.",
      "\"Medicare Advantage has definitely become a much more important part of the Medicare program. It's now the most popular coverage option within the program,\" Joe Albanese, a senior policy analyst at the right-leaning think tank Paragon Health Institute, told ABC News.",
      "\"It's grown very rapidly in popularity over the past decade,\" he continued. \"And that's going change the way that the government interacts with Medicare and Medicare beneficiaries.\"",
      "In an op-ed co-written for Forbes in June 2020, Oz said Medicare Advantage offers better care due to there being competing plans. He said Medicare Advantage could also be expanded to all Americans who are not on Medicaid, which would be funded by a 20% payroll tax. He has also promoted Medicare Advantage on his show, \"The Dr. Oz Show.\"",
      "Trump, too, has promoted Medicare Advantage, touting new benefits for seniors who were enrolled in the plan. What's more, Project 2025 -- a plan of conservative policy proposals proposed by the Heritage Foundation -- has proposed Medicare Advantage be the default option for Medicare coverage.",
      "\"I don't know what plans would be for such a proposal in Congress or in this administration,\" Albanese said. \"I can say that some of the proponents of a default Medicare Advantage enrollment approach say that [Medicare Advantage] plans are typically able to offer comparable, if not lower costs.\"",
      "However, critics argue making Medicare Advantage the default option could privatize the program\u00a0and limit people's options when it comes to receiving care because many doctors and hospitals don't accept Medicare Advantage.",
      "\"To move to a default option, I think it'd be hard to get that, particularly in an administration [that] is in favor of less regulation because Medicare Advantage requires a strong partnership with regulators,\" Daniel Polsky, a Bloomberg Distinguished Professor of health economics at Johns Hopkins University, told ABC News. \"It's making a lot of requirements to ensure that the private insurance companies are using federal dollars wisely and acting in the best interests of the patients that they're responsible for.\"",
      "If Medicare Advantage became the default option, Polsky said, it would increase spending, and the program would not be able to negotiate with as many providers as traditional Medicare can.",
      "\"You have to take the good with the bad with Medicare Advantage if you're going to lean into that program,\" he said. \"There are just going to be beneficiaries that will not be served by that program because they need specialized care with specialized providers that they can't access in that program.\"",
      "Work requirements for Medicaid",
      "Little is known about what Oz's views are on Medicaid, a federal health insurance program for disabled and low-income Americans. CMS\u00a0works with state programs to administer Medicaid, under which more than 72.4 million people are enrolled.",
      "Some Republicans have called to make cuts to Medicaid, which makes up 9% of the federal budget, according to the Peter G. Peterson Foundation.",
      "Sen. John Cornyn, a Republican from Texas, proposed implementing block grants, which are lump sums of money the government provides to states to cover medical expenses. This differs from the current method, in which the government contributes dollars for every dollar spent by the states.",
      "Polsky said there would be negative consequences of moving to a block grants program.",
      "\"To move to a block grants program, any marginal spending by states would be felt at a much higher level,\" he said. \"Medicaid is a really critical counter-cyclical program, so when we're in a recession or moving toward a recession, spending goes up in the Medicaid program that acts as an important kind of macro balance that would somewhat go away because states have to balance their budgets.\"",
      "He added that flexibility for spending to go up or down based on the needs of the patient population in a certain state would also be much harder if a block grants program is implemented, which he said could have \"negative health consequences.\"",
      "Some Republicans may also encourage Oz and the Trump administration to implement work requirements as a basis of eligibility for Medicaid, including working or volunteering for a number of hours or being involved in educational activities.",
      "House Budget Committee Chairman Jodey Arrington, a Republican from Texas, told reporters last week that he supports a \"responsible and reasonable work requirement.\"",
      "Polsky said it would be a deterrent to people who would otherwise qualify for Medicaid signing up, but it also doesn't incentivize work.",
      "\"My familiarity with the evidence -- turns out there weren't too many that were implemented, but there [have] been some work requirements of other programs in the past -- with work requirements is that they don't incentivize or ... actual work doesn't increase for people who enroll in these programs,\" he said.",
      "Polsky said he has found in his research that such requirements create more of an administrative burden due to the added documentation that comes with new requirements.",

    "published": "Wed, 20 Nov 2024 12:29:15 -0500",
    "summary": "As President-elect Donald Trump prepares to take office, some of his cabinet appointees appear to be split on the question of what he should do about TikTok in the U.S.",
    "story": [
      "The popular app must either find a new U.S. owner by Jan. 19 or face a ban.",
      "As President-elect Donald Trump prepares to take office, one of his first orders of business will be to decide about the fate of TikTok in the United States -- and some of his cabinet appointees appear to be split on the issue.",
      "Sources familiar with the president-elect's thinking told ABC News that he may try to stop the ban of the popular social media app, which according to a new law must either find a new U.S. owner by Jan. 19 or face a ban.",
      "Trump's pick to lead the FCC, Brendan Carr, signaled support for banning TikTok in 2022.",
      "\"I think either a total ban or some sort of action like that that's going to completely sever the corporate links back into Beijing,\" Carr told NPR, referencing concerns about possible data usage on the Chinese-owned app.",
      "Former Rep. Matt Gaetz -- Trump's controversial pick to for attorney general, who would lead the department that would enforce any ban -- voted against a ban of the app while he was a member of the House -- though he signaled some support for the initiative.",
      "\"Banning TikTok is the right idea. But this legislation was overly broad, rushed and unavailable for amendment or revision. This is no way to run a railroad (or the internet),\" Gaetz wrote on X, formerly Twitter, at the time.",
      "TikTok and its parents company, ByteDance, have sued the U.S. government over the potential ban, ABC News previously reported, saying it's unconstitutional and violates the First Amendment, while pushing back on claims about the app being security risk.",
      "\"Congress itself has offered nothing to suggest that the TikTok platform poses the types of risks to data security or the spread of foreign propaganda that could conceivably justify the act,\" TikTok's lawsuit said.",
      "A spokesperson for Trump's transition team did not respond to a request for comment from ABC News.",
      "As ABC News previously reported, Trump could try to stop the ban through a number of methods, including pushing Congress to repeal the law banning the app, refusing to enforce the ban, or helping TikTok find a U.S. buyer to comply with the law and render the issue moot.",
      "The ban of the app was spearheaded in Congress by former Rep. Mike Gallagher, who said in an April interview with the New York Times that TikTok posed an \"espionage threat\" and a \"propaganda threat\" and that China is \"America's foremost adversary.\"",
      "Responding to allegations regarding TikTok, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Nig last year said that China \"has never and will not\" direct companies to illegally collect data in other countries, according to The New York Times.",

      "Gallagher resigned early this year and took a job with software company Palantir Technologies. A spokesperson for Gallagher rebuffed questions raised at the time over his swift move to Palantir, a company that was vocal about its opposition to TikTok, according to Forbes magazine.",

    "published": "Wed, 20 Nov 2024 06:38:34 -0500",
    "summary": "President-elect Donald Trump's second term could bring reform to energy permitting and increased fracking on federal lands.",
    "story": [
      "Fracking accounts for the bulk of America's domestic oil and gas production.",
      "President-elect Donald Trump's 2024 campaign was, in part, built on a bedrock of U.S. domestic oil and gas production.",
      "Throughout the election cycle, Trump repeated his \"drill, baby, drill\" slogan, promising a fracking boom that he said could help make America more \"energy independent\" and lower voters' spending at the gas station.",
      "During his campaign speech at Madison Square Garden in October, Trump asserted his oil and gas policy would \"cut your energy prices in half,\" telling voters that within a year of his inauguration in January 2025, they'd see a 50% decrease in costs.",
      "Time will tell what the Trump administration will accomplish, but experts say that within his first few months in office, Trump could dramatically tap into America's drilling landscape.",
      "ABC News has reached out to the Trump campaign for a comment.",
      "\"There's a number of things that he can do within the first 90 days when he gets in office to really help bolster American energy,\" Tim Tarpley, president of the Energy Workforce & Technology Council, told ABC News.",
      "Tarpley oversees the national trade association that represents 220 energy service and technology companies and over 650,000 individuals in the U.S. energy workforce.",
      "Increase fracking on federal land",
      "Trump nominating fracking services executive Chris Wright to spearhead the Department of Energy signals an increase in domestic drilling during his term.",
      "Wright founded the publicly traded oilfield services firm Liberty Energy in 2010, which fracks 20% of the onshore wells nationally.",
      "The $3 billion company is involved in nearly 10% of the United States' total energy production, according to Wright.",
      "\"Chris has been a leading technologist and entrepreneur in Energy. He has worked in Nuclear, Solar, Geothermal, and Oil and Gas,\" Trump wrote in a statement announcing Wright as the nominee.",
      "\"Most significantly, Chris was one of the pioneers who helped launch the American Shale Revolution that fueled American Energy Independence, and transformed the Global Energy Markets and Geopolitics,\" Trump added.",
      "During an interview with Bloomberg in July, Wright suggested that the Trump administration would expand drilling on federal lands and make it easier to permit infrastructure.",
      "Fracking accounts for the bulk of America's domestic oil and gas production, with 95% of new wells being hydraulically fractured, creating two-thirds of the total U.S. gas market and about half of U.S. crude oil production, according to the\u00a0U.S. Energy Department.",
      "Despite the back-and-forth between Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris on a so-called fracking ban during the election cycle, fracking wells in the U.S. are predominantly on private land, with federal land leases only accounting for 24% of the total number of wells, according to the American Petroleum Institute.",
      "Trump's second term in the White House could see a shift in that percentage, with more permits being leased to federal land, Tarpley said, while noting that substantial changes \"will not happen overnight.\"",
      "\"Those numbers may increase, that perpetual share may increase slightly, but I don't think there's going to be a dramatic increase in fracking on federal lands in the near term,\" he said.",
      "Reform permitting processes",
      "At the top of the to-do list, Tarpley said Trump will likely pass a bipartisan permitting reform bill introduced by Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee chairmen Joe Manchin and John Barrasso in July.",
      "Notably, independent Sen. Manchin and Republican Sen. Barrasso represent major energy-producing states, West Virginia and Wyoming.",
      "The Energy Permitting Reform Act of 2024 aims to \"strengthen U.S. energy independence by accelerating the permitting process for critical energy and mineral projects,\" according to the bill.",
      "The legislation slashes the amount of time allotted to energy projects to undergo judicial review. Specifically, it recommends reducing the deadline for filing lawsuits against an agency that has approved or denied a permit from six years to just 150 days.",
      "The bill also requires courts to prioritize cases reviewing an agency permitting decision for oil and gas projects -- essentially moving oil and gas cases up the docket.",
      "Tarpley believes the passing of this legislation, which will likely be possible with the GOP-controlled Senate, will make America more competitive in the global energy market.",
      "\"Currently, it takes about five years to get a permit for a gas pipeline from initial design to construction to done,\" Tarpley said. \"That's well longer than most of our peers around the world.\"",
      "Environmental and health effects",
      "Environmental organizations have decried the Energy Permitting Reform Act. In July, more than 360 environmental organizations shared a joint letter to the Senate committee urging them to reject what they called a \"dirty permitting deal.\"",
      "The organizations, led by the nonprofit Earth Justice, called the legislation, \"an egregious attempt to fulfill the wish list of the fossil fuel industry, which is laid out in the Heritage Foundation's Project 2025, under the guise of promoting renewable energy and developing transmission infrastructure.\"",
      "Organizations fear that the bill and its proposed limitations on the judicial review process will lead to more leasing and drilling without federal oversight and community input.",
      "The National Institutes of Health warns of the impacts of increased fracking, saying chemicals used in the process could lead to air and water contamination, harming human health and the environment.",
      "A 2022 study published in the National Library of Medicine found that air pollutants from fracking sites is associated with multiple cancers and increased health risk.",
      "\"The researchers found that older adults who lived near or downwind of unconventional oil and gas development sites had a higher risk of premature death than those living upwind,\" the NIH reported.",
      "Similarly, the Environmental Protection Agency found scientific evidence that hydraulic fracking activities can affect drinking water resources under some circumstances, but the extent of contamination is unknown.",
      "Still, Trump's vocal support for domestic oil production is something he said could be on the \"Day 1\" agenda.",
      "During a campaign stop in Scranton, Pennsylvania, in October,\u00a0Trump said, \"On Day 1, frack, frack, frack, and drill, drill, drill.\"",
      "\"We will have energy independence and energy dominance,\" he added.",

    "title": "What will be the US military's role in Trump's mass deportation plan?",
    "published": "Wed, 20 Nov 2024 11:00:13 -0500",
    "summary": "Thomas Homan, Trump's choice to serve as the border czar, said U.S. military assets would be a \"force multiplier\" in the deportations.",
    "story": [
      "The border czar said troops would be a \"force multiplier\" in deportations.",
      "The Trump administration's plan to use active-duty U.S. military personnel to help with the mass deportation of undocumented migrants appears to be similar to the support role that troops provided along the U.S-Mexico border in 2018 and 2019, during the first Trump administration.",
      "During his 2024 campaign, President-elect Donald Trump often referenced military personnel forming a part of his plans to assist the deportation, but how they would do that under existing legal authorities was left vague. On Monday, however, Trump confirmed that he planned to declare a national emergency to carry out that campaign promise.",
      "Additionally, Thomas Homan, Trump's choice to serve as the Border Czar, fleshed out his view of how U.S. military assets would be a \"force multiplier\" in the deportations but stressed that they would be carrying out \"non-enforcement duties.\" In other words, military personnel will not be participating in arrests.",
      "\"They'll be used to do non-enforcement duties such as transportation, whether it's on ground or air, infrastructure, building, intelligence,\" Homan said in an interview on Fox Business Network.",
      "U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers doing those duties could be replaced by military personnel \"because it doesn't require immigration authority,\" Homan explained.",
      "He also described the military's role as a \"force multiplier to take more agents, put them on streets where we need them\" and he envisioned the U.S. military possibly assisting in flights taking detainees back to their home countries.",
      "\"We're hoping DOD will help us with air flights, because there's a limited number of planes ICE has contracts with; so DOD can certainly help with air flights all across the globe,\" he said.",
      "Homan's description was very similar to the previous active-duty deployment in 2018 and 2019 ,during Trump's first term that supported U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) as migrant caravans from Central America made their way to the U.S. border.",
      "The mission was ordered in October 2018 and eventually saw the deployment of 6,100 active duty forces to the border, which was soon followed by Trump's declaration of a national emergency that enabled the U.S. military to help build portions of the border wall.",
      "Pentagon officials stressed that the thousands of active-duty troops deployed to the border would only be serving in a support role to federal law enforcement and that they would not carry out law enforcement duties. That role was in line with the Posse Comitatus Act that forbids the U.S. military from carrying out law enforcement duties domestically.",
      "The active-duty troops joined 2,350 National Guardsmen who were already helping CBP in their home states of California, Texas, and Arizona.",
      "Initially, the mission of the active-duty troops was to build housing for additional CBP personnel headed to the region, provide medical support, fly CBP personnel around the border region and construct 70 miles of additional obstacles and security barriers for the 22 ports of entry. Military police units were deployed to provide security for military construction crews working along the border and were the only forces that were allowed to be armed during the deployment.",
      "What was supposed to be a 45-day mission kept being extended and continues to this day in a modified way and in much smaller numbers than 2019.",
      "After the initial mission goals were quickly completed, the Pentagon approved a new Department of Homeland Security request to set up an unarmed quick reaction force to help CPB with riot control in case there was a migrant rush at a port of entry.",
      "In April 2019, the role of active-duty troops was expanded so they could be allowed to assist in driving high-capacity CBP vehicles to transport migrants; provide administrative support, including providing heating, meal distribution and monitoring the welfare of individuals in CBP custody; and attorney support to ICE.",
      "A month later, the Pentagon approved a DHS request to provide tent housing for up to 7,500 single adult migrants at six locations along the border. The tents were to come from U.S. military supplies and were to be erected by U.S. military personnel. . Eventually, DHS requested that active duty personnel set up an additional 150 miles of concertina wire along the border area beyond the 70 miles of obstacles that were laid out in the first six weeks of the border support mission.",
      "Trump's conformation that he plans to declare a national emergency to enable the mass deportation is a different rationale than the national emergency that he declared in 2019.",
      "The 6,100 active-duty troops were deployed to the border under existing authorities. Instead, the national emergency that Trump declared in early 2019 was to make it possible for the U.S military to help construct portions of the border wall that had been one of his major campaign promises.",
      "The National Emergencies Act allows the military to undertake new military construction projects not specified by Congress, but only if previously appropriated funds for such projects are used.",
      "In the end, the Pentagon was able to use $6.1 billion in funding for the wall including $3.6 billion in funds reallocated from other projects and an additional $2.5 billion in funding from counter narcotics efforts.",
      "Declaring a national emergency is not a rare occurrence and the National Emergencies Act has been invoked multiple times. At the time of the border declaration, there were about 30 emergencies already in effect by previous administrations.",

    "published": "Wed, 20 Nov 2024 19:29:46 -0500",
    "summary": "Former Rep. Matt Gaetz met with senators on Capitol Hill on Wednesday alongside Vice President-elect JD Vance.",
    "story": [
      "Sen. Graham said that Gaetz deserves a fair nomination process.",
      "Former Rep. Matt Gaetz, President-elect Donald Trump's pick to be attorney general, met with Republican senators on Capitol Hill Wednesday morning alongside Vice President-elect JD Vance, making his case for the job hours before the House Ethics Committee discussed its report on him, ultimately deciding against releasing its report.",
      "Several senators had called for the House Ethics Committee to release its report into Gaetz over allegations of sexual misconduct and illicit drug use before they would consider his confirmation.",
      "The House Ethics Committee on Wednesday voted against releasing its report on Gaetz after multiple rounds of votes, a source familiar tells ABC News.",
      "After Trump announced Gaetz as his attorney general pick, the Florida congressman resigned from the House, meaning the House Ethics Committee no longer has the jurisdiction to continue its investigation into him -- however Republicans and Democrats had argued whether a break in that precedent was necessary for the Senate to perform its constitutional duty to advise and consent to presidential nominations.",
      "The Justice Department also spent years probing sexual misconduct allegations against Gaetz, as well as allegations of obstruction of justice, before informing Gaetz last year that it would not bring charges. Gaetz has long denied any wrongdoing related to the allegations investigated during the congressional and Justice Department probes.",
      "Republican Sens. Josh Hawley, Lindsey Graham, Mike Lee, Marsha Blackburn, John Kennedy and John Cornyn met with Vance and Gaetz on Wednesday.",
      "The former congressman said the meetings have \"been going great.\"",
      "\"Senators have been giving me a lot of good advice. I'm looking forward to a hearing. Folks have been very supportive, and they've been saying we are going to get a fair process so it's a great day of momentum for the Trump-Vance administration,\" Gaetz said.",
      "Gaetz said he hasn't spoken to Trump on Wednesday, \"But I had a great time with the vice president-elect talking about how we are going to end weaponization at the Department of Justice, we are going to tackle fentanyl, we are going to ensure that we don't have the DOJ involved in censorship anymore, and make sure that we have the country back on track and are there for President Trump's total fulfillment of his promise on his immigration agenda.\"",
      "Asked if he was confident he could be confirmed, Gaetz replied, \"It was a great day.\"",
      "When asked how messy Gaetz's confirmation hearing could become, Sen. Cornyn joked to reporters it could be \"Kavanaugh on steroids\" -- a reference to the now-U.S. Supreme Court justice's contentious confirmation hearings in 2018.",
      "\"He's a smart guy,\" Cornyn added. \"I'm sure he realizes that.\"",
      "Sen. Graham told reporters that the meeting went well and that Gaetz deserves a fair nomination process.",
      "\"Here's what I told him, no rubber stamps and no lynch mob. I'm not going to be part of a process that leaks information that shouldn't be leaked,\" Graham said. \"I'm not going to legitimize the process to destroy the man because people don't like his politics. He will be held to account in the confirmation process. He deserves a chance to make his argument why he should be attorney general.\"",
      "Hawley defended Gaetz's nomination.",
      "\"My intention is to vote for all the president's nominees,\" Hawley said. \"I think for my colleagues who are -- who have concerns about the Attorney General nominee, my message would be, well, let's have a hearing on this. You can ask whatever -- if you're a member of the committee, you can ask whatever question you want, give Gaetz the opportunity to answer questions, lay out his vision, answer concerns.\"",
      "Hawley said Gaetz understands his job, if confirmed, is to \"serve at the pleasure of the president.\"",
      "\"You gotta remember that cabinet secretary is not an exercise in individuality. I mean, you're there to serve at the pleasure of the president. That's the job, and he has a sense of what the president wants to do in terms of prioritizing law enforcement, getting the department out of the business of political prosecutions. So he wants a chance to lay that out,\" Hawley said.",
      "Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee wrote to FBI Director Christopher Wray on Wednesday to request the complete evidentiary file in the bureau's closed investigation into Gaetz. Included in the ask is a request for forms that memorialize interviews conducted as part of the investigation.",
      "The Democrats argued in the letter that there is precedent for the FBI providing these sorts of documents to Congress, including instances when Republicans obtained these documents.",
      "As Vance and Gaetz met with senators, Trump attempted to blame Democrats for the allegations launched against some of his controversial Cabinet picks.",
      "\"They dirty them up, they destroy them, and then they spit them out. They are trying that right now with some great American Patriots who are only trying to fix the mess that the Democrats have made of our Country,\" Trump posted on his social media platform Wednesday afternoon.",

    "published": "Wed, 20 Nov 2024 18:36:04 -0500",
    "summary": "Private prison companies contributed more than a million dollars to Donald Trump's reelection -- and are now poised to benefit from his mass deportation plan.",
    "story": [
      "One company estimated a potential $400 million annual revenue increase.",
      "In the months leading up to Election Day, the nation's largest private prison company poured a million dollars into a super PAC supporting former President Donald Trump.",
      "The donations from Geo Group were far from the largest corporate contribution to Trump's war chest -- but few industries are set to benefit from the incoming Trump administration as significantly as private prisons, which are expecting a surge in business driven by Trump's plan to deport millions of undocumented immigrants.",
      "During a recent corporate earnings call, Geo Group CEO Brian Evans estimated that his company could make as much as $400 million annually by filling empty or underutilized beds at existing detention facilities to support what he called the \"future needs for ICE and the federal government,\" referring to the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency.",
      "\"What is new is a potential sea change by the incoming Trump administration that is expected to implement a much more aggressive policy towards interior and border immigration enforcement,\" Geo Group founder George Zoley said on the call. \"We believe that the private sector will play a critical role in assisting the government in carrying out its objectives.\"",
      "Geo Group could expand the numbers of beds in its detention facilities, offer GPS monitoring for potentially millions of migrants, and ramp up its secure transportation of migrants, according to executives on the Nov. 7 earnings call.",
      "\"We have assured ICE of our capability to rapidly scale up our capabilities to monitor and oversee several hundreds of thousands, or even several millions of individuals in order to achieve the federal government's immigration law compliance objectives,\" Geo Group President Wayne Calabrese said on the call.",
      "Investors appear to have noticed, with the company's stock price jumping more than 80% since the beginning of the month.",
      "Both Zoley and Evans both made contributions directly to Trump's Save America Joint Fundraising Committee, though their $11,600 contributions are a fraction of the million dollars that Geo Acquisition II Inc. -- a subsidiary of the private prison company -- contributed to the Make America Great Again Inc. over the last year.",
      "Geo Acquisition II contributed $500,000 in February before contributing $250,000 in August and again in September, according to Federal Election Commission records.",
      "Saurav Ghosh, a director at the watchdog group Campaign Legal Center, said the contributions were likely made through a subsidiary in order to comply with laws prohibiting federal contractors from making political contributions.",
      "When Geo Group used a separate subsidiary -- GEO Corrections Holdings, Inc -- to contribute money to a pro-Trump super PAC in 2016, the Campaign Legal Center filed a complaint with the Federal Elections Commission, arguing the contribution violated the prohibition on federal contractor contributions. The FEC ultimately dismissed the case after commissioners were deadlocked along partisan lines, clearing the way for future contributions through sister companies that don't directly have contracts with the government.",
      "\"It's still concerning from the perspective of corporations that are looking to drive policy in ways that favor their interests over everyday Americans,\" said Ghosh.",
      "Executives from CoreCivic -- the country's second largest private prison company -- said on a recent earnings call that they are preparing to meet the demand for detention beds that they anticipate from the incoming Trump administration. CoreCivic president Damon Hininger contributed $300,000 to a joint fundraising committee between the Trump campaign and the Republican National Committee over the last year.",
      "\"Trump's first time in office was a free-for-all for companies giving money to his campaign and his companies,\" said Robert Maguire, Vice President for Research and Data at the nonprofit watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington. \"We're going to see that on overdrive during his second term, with private prison companies putting themselves in a position to benefit from this administration.\"",
      "Both CoreCivic and Geo Group also run separate PACs they say aim to \"educate\" officials from both parties about their services -- though a review of the PACs' contributions suggest that Republican candidates and political action committees receive the overwhelming majority of their donations.",
      "The Geo Group Inc. Political Action Committee -- which the company describes as a nonpartisan PAC funded by employee contributions -- contributed more than $670,000 to Republican candidates and aligned PACs over the last two years. The PAC contributed approximately $17,500 to Democratic candidates and causes.",
      "Of the $300,000 in contributions made by CoreCivic's PAC, more than $277,000 have gone toward Republican candidates and political action committees.",
      "In a statement to ABC News, a spokesperson for CoreCivic said the company supports candidates and elected officials who \"understand important solutions\" that the company can provide, like \"reducing recidivism, alleviating prison overcrowding, and providing safe, humane immigration capacity.\"",
      "The spokesperson for the company added that CoreCivic did not make any contributions to any presidential candidate or campaign during the 2024 U.S. presidential cycle.",
      "Representatives for Geo Group did not respond to a request for comment from ABC News.",
      "Despite their contributions favoring Republicans, executives from both companies say their services are provided without regard to party.",
      "\"We have provided these essential services under both Democratic and Republican administrations and during times when either party has been in control of the U.S. Congress,\" Evans, GEO Group CEO, said on the recent earnings call.",
      "Under the Trump administration -- when ICE opened 40 new detention facilities, according to the American Civil Liberties Union -- Geo Group's revenue grew from $2.17 billion in 2016 to $2.35 billion in 2020. When President Joe Biden took office and immediately signed an executive order to eliminate the Department of Justice's use of private prisons, he did not include ICE's use of private detention -- and Geo Group's revenue continued to increase to $2.41 billion in 2023, with ICE accounting for 43% of its customer revenue.",
      "According to Maguire, the private prison industry is now poised to profit from Trump's new policies.",
      "Trump has vowed to carry out the \"largest deportation program in American history\" and has put it in the hands of former acting ICE director Tom Homan, who is now the president-elect's \"border czar.\" According to Homan, the federal government will require \"a massive amount of detention beds\" to house migrants before deporting them.",
      "\"What people don't understand is we can't just put [them on] a plane,\" he said. \"There's a process we have to go through. You have to contact the country, they have to agree to accept them, then they got to send you travel documents. And that takes several days to several weeks. So we need detention assets.\"",
      "As ICE already relies on private-run detention facilities, Homan has suggested that private prison companies would be the cheapest and most effective way to increase the country's capacity to house migrants.",
      "\"Using outside contractors that run facilities like this as their core business function saves millions of dollars in taxpayer funds and increases the quality of care those being detained receive,\" Homan wrote in his 2020 book, \"Defend the Border and Save Lives.\"",

      "\u201cMy father opened up the world to so many people,\" she said. \"He believed deeply that travel could be an enlightening activity and one that did not require a big budget.\u201d",
      "Frommer began writing about travel while serving in the U.S. Army in Europe in the 1950s. When a guidebook he wrote for American soldiers overseas sold out, he launched what became one of the travel industry\u2019s best-known brands, self-publishing \"Europe on 5 Dollars a Day\" in 1957.",
      "\"It struck a chord and became an immediate best-seller,\" he recalled in an interview with The Associated Press in 2007, on the 50th anniversary of the book's debut.",
      "The Frommer\u2019s brand, led today by his daughter Pauline, remains one of the best-known names in the travel industry, with guidebooks to destinations around the world, an influential social media presence, podcasts and a radio show.",
      "Frommer's philosophy \u2014 stay in inns and budget hotels instead of five-star hotels, sightsee on your own using public transportation, eat with locals in small cafes instead of fancy restaurants \u2014 changed the way Americans traveled in the mid- to late 20th century. He said budget travel was preferable to luxury travel \"because it leads to a more authentic experience.\u201d That message encouraged average people, not just the wealthy, to vacation abroad.",
      "It didn\u2019t hurt that his books hit the market as the rise of jet travel made getting to Europe easier than crossing the Atlantic by ship.

Before Frommer, Wheeler said, you could find guidebooks \u201cthat would tell you everything about the church or the temple ruin. But the idea that you wanted to eat somewhere and find a hotel or get from A to B -- well, I\u2019ve got a huge amount of respect for Arthur.\u201d",

      "The final editions of Frommer's groundbreaking series were titled \"Europe from $95 a Day.\" The concept no longer made sense when hotels could not be had for less than $100 a night, so the series was discontinued in 2007. But the Frommer publishing empire did not disappear, despite a series of sales that started when Frommer sold the guidebook company to Simon & Schuster. It was later acquired by Wiley Publishing, which in turn sold it to Google in 2012. Google quietly shut the guidebooks down, but Arthur Frommer \u2014 in a David vs. Goliath triumph \u2014 got his brand back from Google. In November 2013 with his daughter Pauline, he relaunched the print series with dozens of new guidebook titles.",
      "\u201cI never dreamed at my age I\u2019d be working this hard,\u201d he told the AP at the time, age 84.",
      "Frommer also remained a well-known figure in 21st century travel, opinionated to the end of his career, speaking out on his blog and radio show. He hated mega-cruise ships and railed against travel websites where consumers put up their own reviews, saying they were too easily manipulated with phony postings. And he coined the phrase \u201cTrump Slump\u201d in a widely quoted column that predicted a slump in tourism to the U.S. after Donald Trump was elected president.",
      "Frommer was born in Lynchburg, Virginia, and grew up during the Great Depression in Jefferson City, Missouri, the child of a Polish father and Austrian mother. \"My father had one job after another, one company after another that went bankrupt,\" he recalled. The family moved to New York when he was a teenager. He worked as an office boy at Newsweek, went to New York University and was drafted upon graduating from Yale Law School in 1953. Because he spoke French and Russian, he was sent to work in Army intelligence at a U.S. base in Germany, where the Cold War was heating up.",
      "His first glimpse of Europe was from the window of a military transport plane. Whenever he had a weekend leave or a three-day pass, he'd hop a train to Paris or hitch a ride to England on an Air Force flight. Eventually he wrote \"The GI's Guide to Traveling in Europe,\" and a few weeks before his Army stint was up, he had 5,000 copies printed by a typesetter in a German village. They were priced at 50 cents apiece, distributed by the Army newspaper, Stars & Stripes.",
      "Shortly after he returned to New York to practice law at the firm Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison, he received a cable from Europe. \"The book was sold out, would I arrange a reprint?\" he said.",
      "Soon after he spent his month's vacation from the law firm doing a civilian version of the guide. \"In 30 days I went to 15 different cities, getting up at 4 a.m., running up and down the streets, trying to find good cheap hotels and restaurants,\" he recalled.",
      "The resulting book, the very first \u201cEurope on 5 Dollars a Day,\u201d was much more than a list. It was written with a wide-eyed wonder that verged on poetry: \"Venice is a fantastic dream,\" Frommer wrote. \"Try to arrive at night when the wonders of the city can steal upon you piecemeal and slow. ... Out of the dark, there appear little clusters of candy-striped mooring poles; a gondola approaches with a lighted lantern hung from its prow.\"",
      "Eventually Frommer gave up law to write the guides full-time. Daughter Pauline joined him with his first wife, Hope Arthur, on their trips starting in 1965, when she was 4 months old. \"They used to joke that the book should be called 'Europe on Five Diapers a Day,'\" Pauline Frommer said.",
      "In the 1960s, when inflation forced Frommer to change the title of the book to \"Europe on 5 and 10 Dollars a Day,\" he said \"it was as if someone had plunged a knife into my head.\"",
      "Asked to summarize the impact of his books in a 2017 Associated Press interview, he said that in the 1950s, \u201cmost Americans had been taught that foreign travel was a once-in-a-lifetime experience, especially travel to Europe. They were taught that they were going to a war-torn country where it was risky to stay in any hotel other than a five-star hotel. It was risky to go into anything but a top-notch restaurant. \u2026 And I knew that all these warnings were a lot of nonsense.\u201d",
      "He added: \u201cWe were pioneers in also suggesting that a different type of American should travel, that you didn\u2019t have to be well-heeled.\u201d",
      "To the end of his life, he said he avoided traveling first class. \u201cI fly economy class and I try to experience the same form of travel, the same experience that the average American and the average citizen of the world encounters,\u201d he said.",
      "As Frommer aged, his daughter Pauline gradually became the force behind the company, promoting the brand, managing the business and even writing some of the content based on her own travels. Her relationship with her father was both tender and respectful, and she summed it up this way in a 2012 email to AP: \u201cIt\u2019s wonderful to have a working partner whose mind is a steel trap, and who doesn't just have smarts, but wisdom. His opinions, whether or not you agree with them, come from his social values. He's a man who puts ethics at the center of his life, and weaves them into everything he does.\u201d",
      "In addition to Pauline, Frommer\u2019s survivors include his second wife, Roberta Brodfeld, and four grandchildren."

    "published": "Mon, 18 Nov 2024 18:26:16 -0500",
    "summary": "Spirit Airlines has filed for bankruptcy protection and will attempt to reboot as it struggles to recover from the pandemic-caused swoon in travel and a failed attempt to sell the airline to JetBlue",
    "story": [
      "Spirit Airlines has filed for bankruptcy protection and will attempt to reboot as it struggles to recover from the pandemic-caused swoon in travel and a failed attempt to sell the airline to JetBlue",
      "Spirit Airlines said Monday that it has filed for bankruptcy protection and will attempt to reboot as it struggles to recover from the pandemic-caused swoon in travel, stiffer competition from bigger carriers, and a failed attempt to sell the airline to JetBlue.",
      "Spirit, the biggest U.S. budget airline, filed a Chapter 11 bankruptcy petition after working out terms with bondholders. The airline has lost more than $2.5 billion since the start of 2020 and faces looming debt payments totaling more than $1 billion in 2025 and 2026.",
      "The airline said it expects to continue operating normally during the bankruptcy process. Spirit told customers Monday they can book flights and use frequent-flyer points as they ordinarily would, and said employees and vendors would continue getting paid.",
      "The airline said it received commitments for a $350 million equity investment from existing bondholders and will convert $795 million of their debt into stock in the restructured company. The bondholders will also extend a $300 million loan that, combined with Spirit\u2019s remaining cash, will help the airline get through the restructuring.",
      "The airline's shares dropped 25% on Friday, after The Wall Street Journal reported that the airline was discussing terms of a possible bankruptcy filing with its bondholders. Spirit, based in Dania Beach, Florida, missed a deadline for filing its third-quarter financial results but announced that its operating margin would indicate a bigger loss than the company had in the same quarter last year.",
      "Those were just the latest in a series of blows that have sent the stock crashing down by 97% since late 2018 \u2014 when Spirit was still making money.",
      "CEO Ted Christie confirmed in August that Spirit was talking to advisers of its bondholders about the upcoming debt maturities. On Monday, he called the deal with bondholders \u201ca strong vote of confidence in Spirit and our long-term plan.\u201d",
      "People are still flying on Spirit Airlines. They\u2019re just not paying as much.",
      "In the first six months of this year, Spirit passengers flew 2% more than they did in the same period last year. However, they are paying 10% less per mile, and revenue per mile from fares is down nearly 20%, contributing to Spirit\u2019s red ink.",
      "It\u2019s not a new trend. Spirit failed to return to profitability when the coronavirus pandemic eased and travel rebounded. There are several reasons behind the slump.",
      "Spirit\u2019s costs, especially for labor, have risen. The biggest U.S. airlines have snagged some of Spirit\u2019s budget-conscious customers by offering their own brand of bare-bones tickets. And fares for U.S. leisure travel \u2014 Spirit\u2019s core business \u2014 sagged this summer because of a glut of new flights.",
      "The premium end of the air-travel market has surged while Spirit\u2019s traditional no-frills end has stagnated. So this summer, Spirit decided to sell bundled fares that include a bigger seat, priority boarding, free bags, internet service and snacks and drinks. It also dropped cancellation fees after rival Frontier Airlines did so.",
      "Those were huge changes from Spirit\u2019s longtime strategy, which focuses on grabbing customers with rock-bottom fares and then getting them to pay extra for things that are free on many other airlines, such as bringing a carry-on bag or ordering a soda.",
      "In a highly unusual move, Spirit planned to cut its October-through-December schedule by nearly 20%, compared with the same period last year, which analysts said should help prop up fares. But that would help rivals more than it would boost Spirit.",
      "Analysts from Deutsche Bank and Raymond James say that Frontier, JetBlue and Southwest would benefit the most because of their overlap with Spirit on many routes.",
      "Spirit has also been plagued by required repairs to Pratt & Whitney engines, which is forcing the airline to ground dozens of its Airbus jets. Spirit has cited the recall as it furloughed pilots.",
      "The aircraft fleet is relatively young, which has made Spirit an attractive takeover target.",
      "Frontier tried to merge with Spirit in 2022 but was outbid by JetBlue. However, the Justice Department sued to block the $3.8 billion deal, saying it would drive up prices for Spirit customers who depend on low fares, and a federal judge agreed in January. JetBlue and Spirit dropped their merger two months later.",
      "U.S. airline bankruptcies were common in the 1990s and 2000s, as airlines struggled with fierce competition, high labor costs and sudden spikes in the price of jet fuel. PanAm, TWA, Northwest, Continental, United and Delta were swept up. Some liquidated, while others used favorable laws to renegotiate debts such as aircraft leases and keep flying.",
      "The last bankruptcy by a major U.S. carrier ended when American Airlines emerged from Chapter 11 protection and simultaneously merged with US Airways in December 2013."

      "U.S. stocks drifted to a mixed finish, though the modest moves for indexes masked some thrashing underneath the surface",
      "NEW YORK -- U.S. stocks drifted to a mixed finish on Wednesday, though the modest moves for indexes masked some thrashing underneath the surface. Target lost more than a fifth of its value after the retailer gave a dour forecast for the holiday shopping season.",
      "The S&P 500 finished the day virtually unchanged after coming back from a loss of 1% during the morning. The Dow Jones Industrial Average eked out a gain of 139 points, or 0.3%, and the Nasdaq composite slipped 0.1%.",
      "Target\u2019s 21.4% tumble followed its report showing weaker profit and revenue for the latest quarter than analysts expected. The retailer also gave a forecast for profit in the upcoming holiday season that was below analysts\u2019 estimates.",

      "Hints about how U.S. consumers are doing are under particular scrutiny, given that they\u2019ll need to keep spending if the U.S. economy is to continue growing and avoid a recession. Shoppers are contending with high prices across the economy and still-high interest rates.",
      "\u201cI find the Target and Walmart earnings very interesting because we typically see a waterfall type effect when the economy begins to struggle, with shoppers trading down from stores such as Target to Walmart,\u201d said JJ Kinahan, CEO of IG North America. \u201cI\u2019m not entirely sure if the move to Walmart is simply a matter of shoppers finding more items they like at Walmart or if this is a potentially concerning economic sign.\u201d",

It\u2019s grown so fast, with its stock nearly tripling for the year so far, that pressure has grown for it to show it can keep leapfrogging past analysts\u2019 already high expectations.",

      "Wells Fargo Investment Institute on Wednesday raised its forecasts for where Treasury yields will end next year, in part because of expectations that Trump\u2019s policies will drive faster U.S. economic growth and inflation. Strategists at the institute also raised their forecast for where the S&P 500 will end next year because of that faster growth, which should translate into bigger corporate profits, along with easier regulations.",

    "story": [
      "Two former Georgia election workers who won a $148 million defamation judgment against Rudy Giuliani have asked a judge to penalize him even more",
      "Two former Georgia election workers who won a $148 million defamation judgment against Rudy Giuliani asked a judge Wednesday to penalize him even further for continuing to falsely accuse them of tampering with ballots during the 2020 presidential election.",
      "Attorneys for Ruby Freeman and her daughter, Wandrea \u201cShaye\u201d Moss, argued in a filing in a Washington, D.C. federal court that Giuliani has \u201cbrazenly\u201d violated an agreement he signed to stop repeating the falsehoods, The alleged violations came in statements he made during two recent broadcasts of his nightly show on the social media platform X.",
      "\u201cThese statements repeat the exact same lies for which Mr. Giuliani has already been held liable, and which he agreed to be bound by court order to stop repeating,\u201d read the filing, which asked the judge to hold Giuliani in contempt and impose sanctions against him.",
      "A lawyer for Giuliani, Joseph M. Cammarata, said he had not seen the court filing and could not respond to its specific claims, but accused the women's attorneys of trying to intimidate the former New York City mayor. In a statement, Giuliani's spokesperson, Ted Goodman, called the new legal filing an attempt to \u201cdeprive Mayor Rudy Giuliani of his First Amendment right to freedom of speech.\u201d",
      "Giuliani, a longtime Donald Trump ally, was found liable last year for defaming Freeman and Moss by accusing them of ballot tampering as he pushed then-President Trump\u2019s lies about election fraud. The women said they faced death threats after Giuliani falsely claimed they sneaked in ballots in suitcases, counted ballots multiple times and tampered with voting machines.",
      "The $148 million judgment led to a failed bankruptcy attempt by Giuliani. He has since been ordered to turn over many of his assets to Freeman and Moss, including his $5 million Upper East Side apartment.",
      "In December, the women sued Giuliani again for continuing to repeat his ballot-tampering claims, resulting in the court issuing a permanent injunction in May that barred the former mayor from making any statements that suggest the women engaged in any wrongdoing in connection with the 2020 presidential election.",
      "Lawyers for the two plaintiffs argued in Wednesday's court filing that Giuliani broke that agreement when he referred to the pair again on his recent video broadcasts on Nov. 12 and Nov. 14, including baselessly claiming that he was not allowed to show tapes of \"quadruple counting\" ballots during the trial.",
      "In his statement responding to the filing, Goodman argued that Giuliani \u201chas every right to defend himself.\u201d",
      "Giuliani has been critical of a judge\u2019s ruling that ordered him to turn over many prized possessions to Freeman and Moss \u2014 including the apartment, a Mercedes once owned by movie star Lauren Bacall and dozens of luxury watches. He said he should not have had to surrender his possessions until his appeal is decided.",
      "At a news conference in New York City on Wednesday, Cammarata said Giuliani has turned over \u201c90 to 95%\u201d of his possessions. Last week Giuliani surrendered the Mercedes and watches. Cammarata said the 1980 Mercedes-Benz SL 500, Giuliani's only vehicle, should be appraised to determine whether it's worth less than $5,500, an amount he said would exempt the car from the judgment.",
      "As for the New York apartment, Cammarata said it either has been turned over or is in the process of being turned over.",
      "Giuliani has remained defiant amid the collection efforts, which have stretched past an Oct. 29 deadline.",
      "\u201cWe will not relent,\u201d Cammarata said.",

      "Philadelphia's mass transit system has reached a tentative contract deal with its largest workers union, averting a potential strike that could have seen thousands of employees walk off the job.",
      "The Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority and Transport Workers Union Local 234 announced the one-year agreement Wednesday. It calls for union members to receive a 5% raise and an unspecified pension adjustment. The contract also has language aimed at improving the personal safety of frontline workers, including installing bulletproof enclosures for drivers since many face violence and harassment.",
      "Union President Brian Pollitt said a ratification vote would be held Dec. 6.",
      "The agreement comes about two weeks after union members had voted to authorize a strike once their one-year contract with SEPTA expired Nov. 8. Union leaders, though, agreed to delay a strike as long as they felt progress was being made at the bargaining table.",
      "Local 234 has about 5,000 members, including bus, subway and trolley operators, mechanics, cashiers, maintenance people and custodians.",
      "Late Wednesday afternoon, officials at SMART-TD Local 1594, which represents about 350 SEPTA workers in several suburban counties, also announced a tentative agreement they said includes a wage increase and \u201ccritical safety improvements.\u201d",
      "Pollitt said Wednesday that avoiding a strike was a priority, noting that public transit is a \u201cnecessary need\u201d for many residents, including students who take SEPTA trains and buses to school and workers who rely on the agency to get to their jobs.",
      "\"We got a fair deal, and now we need to focus on making sure SEPTA stays strong for everyone who depends on it,\" Pollitt said.",
      "Scott Sauer, SEPTA's interim general manager, said both sides worked hard to reach a deal.",
      "\u201cThis agreement is fair to our hardworking frontline employees and responsible to the customers and taxpayers,\u201d he said.",
      "SEPTA, which has repeatedly said its financial health is uncertain, recently proposed an across-the-board 21.5% fare increase that would start New Year\u2019s Day as well as severe service cuts that would take effect next summer. The agency has scheduled a Dec. 13 public hearing on the plan.",
      "If approved by SEPTA\u2019s board, riders would pay the increase on top of a proposed interim average fare increase of 7.5% the panel is due to consider later this month. If passed, it would take effect Dec. 1. If both increases take effect, the single fare cost of riding the city bus and subway would go from $2 to $2.90. SEPTA key fares, where riders get discounts for using a prepaid card to pay fares that now range from $3.75 to $6.50, depending on the zone they use, would range from $5 to $8.75 on Jan. 1.",
      "SEPTA last raised fares in 2017, and the proposed increase would be expected to bring in an additional $23 million for this fiscal year and $45 million per year starting in 2026.",
      "The nation\u2019s sixth-largest mass transit system, SEPTA faces an annual structural budget deficit of $240 million as federal pandemic aid phases out. It lost out on about $161 million in state aid since the Republican-controlled state Senate declined to vote on Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro\u2019s proposal for $283 million in new state aid to public transit. Instead, lawmakers approved a one-time payment to the state trust fund for transit systems, of which SEPTA got $46 million.",

      "A push by New York City jail officials to block people detained at Rikers Island from receiving physical mail was based on faulty fentanyl test strips that overstated the influx of contraband sent through the mail",
      "NEW YORK -- In 2022, New York City\u2019s jails commissioner, Louis Molina, issued a dire warning to local lawmakers: fentanyl was pouring into Rikers Island through the mail, he said, spurring an overdose crisis among the jail's detainees and putting guards at risk.",
      "As evidence of the insidious threat, Molina passed around a child\u2019s drawing of a reindeer, one of hundreds of seized items he said had been \u201cliterally soaked in the drug and mailed to people in custody.\u201d",
      "But that claim was based on faulty drug-testing kits with a stunning 85% false positive rate, according to a report released Wednesday by the city\u2019s Department of Investigation. The report found the city vastly overstated the prevalence of fentanyl sent by mail to detainees.",
      "When investigators retested 71 pieces of mail initially flagged by field tests as containing fentanyl, only 10 actually showed traces of the drug. The drawing of a reindeer highlighted by Molina was fentanyl-free.",
      "Field tests indicating an influx of fentanyl-laced mail to Rikers Island fueled a yearslong campaign by Mayor Eric Adams\u2019 administration to bar people in city custody from receiving physical mail.",
      "As a replacement, city officials proposed redirecting mail to an offsite vendor, who would then upload it digitally for the incarcerated person to read on a tablet \u2014 a practice used in other correctional systems, including New York's state prisons. So far, the proposal has been blocked by a jail oversight board.",
      "Jocelyn Strauber, the commissioner of the Department of Investigation, said the city should reassess its ongoing effort to bar detainees from receiving mail, given the report\u2019s findings.",
      "\u201cThe field tests don\u2019t support a concern that a high rate of fentanyl-laced objects are coming in from the mail,\u201d she told The Associated Press. \u201cTo the extent policy determinations are based on flawed data, they ought to be reconsidered.\u201d",
      "Detainee advocates have long contended that drugs primarily enter the jail system via employees, who can easily smuggle them inside and sell them to gang leaders. In recent years, dozens of correction officers have been charged in multiple investigations of smuggling rings on Rikers Island.",
      "In its report, the Department of Investigation said corrections officials had failed to implement many of the department's previous recommendations aimed at screening staff for contraband.",
      "In an email statement, a Department of Correction spokesperson said the agency would review the report and continue refining its testing processes. \u201cField tests are a tool used to quickly assess potential threats, and while not perfect, they play an important role in our safety protocols,\u201d the statement said.",
      "Such field tests have gained popularity in recent years alongside a spike in opioid overdose deaths nationwide, allowing law enforcement officials to bypass the lengthy lab process to determine if a substance contains narcotics.",
      "But experts have long raised questions about the strips' effectiveness. Under federal regulations, manufacturers are required to include language on their packaging indicating that results are preliminary until confirmed by a lab \u2014 something that rarely happens in correctional settings.",
      "Last November, New York\u2019s state prison system was found to have wrongly punished more than 2,000 detainees due to false positives from drug tests manufactured by Sirchie Finger Print Laboratories.",
      "For years, the test strips used on Rikers Island, the city-run jail system, were also provided by Sirchie. But after complaints about the reliability of the tests, the Department of Correction switched to kits made by DetectaChem last April.",
      "The review by the Department of Investigation found DetectaChem\u2019s test strips had a false positive rate of 79%, while Sirchie\u2019s were wrong 91% of the time.",
      "Inquiries to Sirchie were not returned.",
      "Travis Kisner, the chief operating officer of DetectaChem, said the company was still reviewing the report, but added: \u201cWe stand behind our product.\""

      "The cross-examination of a man who says he was raped as a teenager by New Hampshire youth center workers turned acrimonious, with the witness at one point calling an opposing lawyer a \u201csick man.\u201d",
      "MANCHESTER, N.H. -- The cross-examination of a man who says he was raped as a teenager by youth center workers in New Hampshire turned acrimonious Wednesday, with the accuser at one point calling an opposing lawyer a \"sick man\u201d following a heated exchange.",
      "It was the second day in the trial of Bradley Asbury, who is accused of holding down 14-year-old Michael Gilpatrick on a staircase in 1997 with help from a colleague, while a third staffer raped the teen and a fourth forced him to perform a sex act.",
      "It\u2019s the second criminal trial to stem from a broad 2019 investigation into historic abuse at the Sununu Youth Services Center in Manchester. Asbury, now 70, is among 11 men who worked there or at an associated facility in Concord who were arrested.",
      "Gilpatrick, now 41, took the stand for a second day and was questioned by defense lawyer David Rothstein, who pointed out inconsistencies in his recollection of the events leading up to the alleged attack, including how many times he\u2019d been released home in the months beforehand, what time of day the incident occurred, and whether there were other children around.",
      "Gilpatrick said his recollection of details before and after the attack were hazy.",
      "\u201cWhat I won\u2019t forget, do you want me to continue to tell you?\u201d Gilpatrick said during one of several fiery exchanges with the lawyer. \u201cThat your client held me down while another man raped me.\"",
      "\u201cGo ahead and say it again, in case they didn\u2019t hear it,\u201d the lawyer responded. \u201cSay it again.\u201d",
      "\u201cHe held me down and raped me,\u201d Gilpatrick said loudly, as he leaned into the microphone.",
      "\u201cSay it again,\u201d the lawyer responded.",
      "\u201cYou want me to keep saying it? You\u2019re a sick man,\u201d Gilpatrick said, before asking the judge for a break and storming off the stand.",
      "Rothstein said the attack never happened and Gilpatrick is motivated by money. He pointed out Gilpatrick has received more than $146,000 against an anticipated payout from a related civil case.",
      "\u201cYou're trying to establish that this is about money, and it's got nothing to do with money,\u201d Gilpatrick testified.",
      "Prosecutor Audriana Mekula said the rape occurred after Gilpatrick made a smart-aleck comment to Asbury and his colleagues and was then dropped onto the floor from behind, picked up by his arms and legs, and dragged onto a staircase at the juvenile lockup.",
      "Asbury had been fired from the Concord facility three years before over allegations of physical and psychological abuse. But he was later rehired and transferred to Manchester, where he worked until 2001.",
      "He is charged with two counts of being an accomplice to aggravated sexual assault. If found guilty, he faces a maximum prison term of 20 years on each count. The trial is expected to conclude either Thursday or Friday.",
      "An earlier case against Victor Malavet ended in a mistrial in September after jurors deadlocked on whether he raped a girl at the Concord facility. A new trial in that case has yet to be scheduled.",
      "The investigation has also led to extensive civil litigation. More than 1,100 former residents have filed lawsuits alleging physical, sexual or emotional abuse spanning six decades. In the only civil case to go to trial so far, a jury awarded David Meehan $38 million in May for abuse he says he suffered in the 1990s, though that verdict remains in dispute as the state seeks to reduce it to $475,000.",
      "The Associated Press generally does not identify those who say they were victims of sexual assault unless they have come forward publicly, as Meehan and Gilpatrick have done."

    "story": [
      "A Philadelphia jury has awarded $11 million to a man whose holstered Sig Sauer pistol went off by itself while he was going down the stairs",
      "A Philadelphia jury awarded $11 million on Wednesday to a man whose holstered Sig Sauer pistol went off by itself while he was going down the stairs, causing a serious leg injury \u2014 the second major verdict this year against the embattled gun manufacturer over its P320 model.",
      "After a three-week trial, the jury concluded that New Hampshire-based Sig Sauer was negligent for selling a defective gun and holster. The plaintiff's lawyers said the P320 pistol is prone to going off without the trigger being pulled, a defect that has led to scores of injuries around the U.S.",
      "More than 100 people have come forward to make similar allegations about the P320. Sig Sauer insists the gun is safe.",
      "\u201cWe've been asking Sig for over three years now to recall this gun, to fix it, and frankly to use the same type of safeties that other manufacturers are using that Sig Sauer is not,\u201d Robert W. Zimmerman, the plaintiff's lawyer, said after the verdict.",
      "He added that the verdict \u201csends a strong message to Sig Sauer that they need to do something with this gun.\u201d",
      "Zimmerman represented George Abrahams, a U.S. Army veteran and painting contractor in Philadelphia, who has said he holstered his P320, put it in the pocket of his athletic pants and zipped it up before going downstairs. The gun went off and the bullet tore through his right thigh, exiting above the knee, causing permanent injuries, according to court documents.",
      "At trial, Sig Sauer sought to shift blame to Abrahams. The company said in a statement posted on its website that jurors had \u201cagreed that plaintiff\u2019s own negligence contributed to his accident,\" and it defended the P320 as \u201camong the most tested, proven, and successful handguns in recent history.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe strongly disagree with the verdict in this unintended discharge lawsuit ... and will be appealing the decision on multiple grounds,\" the company said.",
      "Earlier this year, a federal jury awarded $2.35 million to a Georgia man who was wounded when his holstered P320 went off. Zimmerman's law firm, Saltz Mongeluzzi Bendesky, also represented that plaintiff, and has a raft of other pending claims against Sig Sauer. The company has indicated it plans to appeal the Georgia verdict.",
      "\u201cWe have said it before, and juries are now speaking loud and clear with their verdicts; this gun is a danger to gun owners and anyone within the vicinity of this gun,\u201d Ryan Hurd, Zimmerman's co-counsel, said in a statement Wednesday.",
      "Abrahams' lawsuit, which was filed in 2022, recounted dozens of unintended discharge incidents involving the P320, of which lawyers have estimated there are about a half-million in circulation in the U.S. The suit asserted the P320 \u201cis the most dangerous pistol for its users sold in the United States market.\u201d",
      "The military version of the pistol comes with an external safety to prevent unintended discharges, according to plaintiffs' lawyers, but the model sold to police departments and civilians does not.",
      "In 2019, the unintentional discharge of a Philadelphia transit officer\u2019s holstered P320 prompted SEPTA, the city\u2019s transit agency, to remove all of its P320 handguns from service and replace them with Glocks.",
      "Sig Sauer has settled at least one federal class action lawsuit involving the P320, involving pistols made before 2017, offering refunds or replacement guns to purchasers."

      "Virginia can't withdraw from a multistate initiative designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions unless the Legislature agrees to it, a judge has ruled, dealing a blow to Gov. Glenn Youngkin's efforts to exit the compact.",
      "The ruling, issued Monday by retired Judge C. Randall Lowe in Floyd County, said Virginia's Air Pollution Control Board exceeded its authority when it voted last year to exit the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative.",
      "The Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative is an effort by 12 mid-Atlantic and Northeast states to reduce power plants\u2019 carbon emissions. Participating states require plants of a certain generating capacity to purchase allowances to emit carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas that contributes to global warming.",
      "Virginia joined the compact in 2020 when it had a Democratic governor as well as Democratic control of the Legislature. In 2021, Youngkin, a Republican, won election as governor but one or both legislative chambers have remained under Democratic control for the entirety of his term.",
      "Youngkin has said Virginia's participation in the cap-and-trade program amounts to a hidden tax on Virginians' energy bills.",
      "His spokesman, Christian Martinez, said Wednesday that the state will appeal the judge's ruling.",
      "\u201cGovernor Youngkin remains committed to lowering the cost of living for Virginians by continuing to oppose the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, which fails to effectively incentivize emission reductions in the Commonwealth,\u201d he said in a written statement.",
      "Shaun Kenney, a spokesman for Republican Attorney General Jason Miyares, also expressed disappointment in the judge's ruling in a written statement, saying: \"We look forward to defending the commonsense repeal of this counterproductive program on appeal.\u201d",
      "The State Corporation Commission has estimated the typical monthly bill could increase by $2 to $2.50 for the years 2027 to 2030.",

      "Virginia formally exited the compact at the end of 2023.",
      "Virginia House Speaker Don Scott, a Democrat, praised the judge's ruling, calling it \u201ca win for all Virginians, their wallets, and our environment. Programs funded by RGGI have helped Virginians cut household energy costs, helped protect communities from floodwaters, and have been critical in the fight to cut pollution and address climate change.\u201d",

      "Comcast is spinning off into a new company many of its cable television networks that were once at the heart of the entertainment giant, as consumers increasingly swap out their cable TV subscriptions for streaming platforms",
      "WASHINGTON -- Comcast is spinning off into a new company many of the cable television networks that were once at the entertainment giant's heart as consumers increasingly swap out their cable TV subscriptions for streaming platforms.",
      "Those one-time stars for Comcast's NBCUniversal cable television networks include USA, Oxygen, E!, SYFY and Golf Channel, as well as CNBC and MSNBC. Movie ticketing platform Fandango and the Rotten Tomatoes movie rating site will also become part of the new company.",
      "Streaming service Peacock will remain with Comcast, as will Bravo, which provides significant content for the Peacock streaming service, and other assets like the NBCUniversal's studios and theme parks.",
      "Comcast telegraphed the shift last month, before confirming Wednesday that it will spin off assets that generated about $7 billion in revenue over the past 12 months ending Sept. 30. That\u2019s about 5.5% of Comcast\u2019s total revenue during that period, according to the company.",
      "How exactly this split will impact customers is not yet clear. Experts maintain it\u2019s too early to tell, given that Comcast aims to complete the transition over the next year.",
      "Some analysts speculate that the spun-off networks may have more freedom to bring their content elsewhere. That could mean you'll have more options to find and curate what you want to watch and where \u2014 or headaches from juggling several different subscriptions in an already-fractured media landscape.",
      "Wednesday's announcement arrives as more and more people \u201ccut the cord\u201d on cable, with millions canceling service subscriptions every year \u2014 and instead signing up for streaming platforms.",
      "Paul Verna, principal analyst and vice president of content for market research company eMarketer, said Comcast\u2019s decision to divest itself from most of its cable TV channels is a reflection of that trend.",
      "\u201cThe writing is on the wall that the cable TV business is a dwindling business,\u201d Verna said. \u201cThat\u2019s why Comcast did what it did today.\u201d",
      "Mike Proulx, a vice president and research director of Forrester, added that the spin-off marks \u201csimply a reconciliation of assets that detract from the company\u2019s inevitable all streaming future.\u201d",
      "Comcast expects the new company, which it referred to as \u201cSpinCo\u201d Wednesday, to have the financial flexibility to be \u201ca potential partner and acquirer of other complementary media businesses.\u201d And Mark Lazarus, the current chairman of NBCUniversal Media Group who will serve as the new entity\u2019s CEO, said Wednesday that the standalone company \u201cwill be better positioned to serve our audiences and drive shareholder returns.\u201d",
      "Like other cable companies, Comcast in recent years has shifted its business emphasis away from traditional cable toward streaming and other sources of revenue, such as its movie studio, theme parks and home wireless and internet services.",
      "Despite a slightly confusing, glitchy start, Peacock has been one of the company's biggest success stories, with recent boosts gained in part by the streaming platform's popularity during the 2024 Paris Olympic Games. In its most recent quarter, Comcast reported that paid Peacock subscribers jumped by 3 million, or 29%, to 36 million subscribers. Peacock\u2019s revenue soared 82% to $1.5 billion in the period.",
      "Dropping \u201cmoney-losing assets\u201d to instead focus on these kinds of lucrative business is clearly beneficial to Comcast, Verna said \u2014 but the future of a new company housing primarily cable networks is less promising. He said he finds it hard \u201cto envision that this company will stay independent for a long time,\" predicting future consolidation of the networks or acquisitions through private equity.",
      "Howard Gutman, private equity strategy and coverage lead for MorganFranklin Consulting, also expects consolidation to be in the cards. He noted the spin-off might entice bigger streaming services that are in search of more content, for example, to buy up these kinds of assets.",
      "That could mean watchers of the Golf Channel, for example, finding its content on what were once rival platforms. But the spun-off assets might also find more power to focus on priorities specific to them under a smaller company umbrella, Gutman added. That would potentially open the door for networks like CNBC to further monetize its own content or expand its brand.",
      "\u201cI think it will open up opportunities,\u201d he said, adding that customers will also have more options to curate subscriptions based on what interests them the most.",
      "Verna is less optimistic. He pointed to a history of changes in the media landscape that has repeatedly been tough for consumers.",
      "People already have a hard time figuring out where to watch or stream something they're looking for, Verna said, and deals to license or spread that out further could worsen that. And paying for more and more services adds up, particularly as platforms have hiked prices over time.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s too early to know what impact (the Comcast spin-offs) will have .... But I wouldn\u2019t hold my breath (on there being) a net benefit to consumers,\u201d Verna said. \u201cConsumers are the ones who are supposed to be driving these trends, and to some extent they are. But they also tend to get the short end of the stick every time.\u201d",
      "The spin-off is targeted for completion in about a year, the entertainment giant said Wednesday, pending financing and approval from its board and government regulators.",
      "Beyond Lazarus' appointment to CEO of the new company, Anand Kini, the current chief financial officer of NBCUniversal, will take on the same title with the new company as well as the chief operating officer role.",

    "story": [
      "A federal judge has signed off on a settlement agreement Wednesday in a class action lawsuit alleging that an algorithm designed to score rental applicants discriminated on the basis of race and income",
      "Mary Louis' excitement to move into an apartment in Massachusetts in the spring of 2021 turned to dismay when Louis, a Black woman, received an email saying that a \u201cthird-party service\u201d had denied her tenancy.",
      "That third-party service included an algorithm designed to score rental applicants, which became the subject of a class action lawsuit, with Louis at the helm, alleging that the algorithm discriminated on the basis of race and income.",
      "A federal judge approved a settlement in the lawsuit, one of the first of it's kind, on Wednesday, with the company behind the algorithm agreeing to pay over $2.2 million and roll back certain parts of it's screening products that the lawsuit alleged were discriminatory.",
      "The settlement does not include any admissions of fault by the company SafeRent Solutions, which said in a statement that while it \u201ccontinues to believe the SRS Scores comply with all applicable laws, litigation is time-consuming and expensive.\"",
      "While such lawsuits might be relatively new, the use of algorithms or artificial intelligence programs to screen or score Americans isn't. For years, AI has been furtively helping make consequential decisions for U.S. residents.",
      "When a person submits a job application, applies for a home loan or even seeks certain medical care, there\u2019s a chance that an AI system or algorithm is scoring or assessing them like it did Louis. Those AI systems, however, are largely unregulated, even though some have been found to discriminate.",
      "\u201cManagement companies and landlords need to know that they\u2019re now on notice, that these systems that they are assuming are reliable and good are going to be challenged,\u201d said Todd Kaplan, one of Louis\u2019 attorneys.",
      "The lawsuit alleged SafeRent's algorithm didn't take into account the benefits of housing vouchers, which they said was an important detail for a renter's ability to pay the monthly bill, and it therefore discriminated against low-income applicants who qualified for the aid.",
      "The suit also accused SafeRent's algorithm of relying too much on credit information. They argued that it fails to give a full picture of an applicant's ability to pay rent on time and unfairly dings applicants with housing vouchers who are Black and Hispanic partly because they have lower median credit scores, attributable to historical inequities.",
      "Christine Webber, one of the plaintiff's attorneys, said that just because an algorithm or AI is not programmed to discriminate, the data an algorithm uses or weights could have \"the same effect as if you told it to discriminate intentionally.\u201d",
      "When Louis' application was denied, she tried appealing the decision, sending two landlords' references to show she\u2019d paid rent early or on time for 16 years, even if she didn't have a strong credit history.",
      "Louis, who had a housing voucher, was scrambling, having already given notice to her previous landlord that she was moving out, and she was charged with taking care of her granddaughter.",
      "The response from the management company, which used SafeRent's screening service, read, \u201cWe do not accept appeals and cannot override the outcome of the Tenant Screening.\u201d",

      "SafeRent\u2019s defense attorneys argued in a motion to dismiss that the company shouldn\u2019t be held liable for discrimination because SafeRent wasn\u2019t making the final decision on whether to accept or deny a tenant.

      "Louis\u2019 attorneys, along with the U.S. Department of Justice, which submitted a statement of interest in the case, argued that SafeRent\u2019s algorithm could be held accountable because it still plays a role in access to housing.

    "story": [
      "As Donald Trump prepares to return to power, his victory is likely to embolden those who think they can get his ear",
      "WASHINGTON -- As incoming White House chief of staff, one of Susie Wiles \u2019 vexing challenges will be policing the buffet line of powerful interests who want something from Donald Trump.",
      "It\u2019s a world she knows well. During Trump\u2019s first presidency, she lobbied for many of them.",
      "Trump was first elected on a pledge to \u201cdrain the swamp\u201d in Washington. But his transactional approach to the presidency instead ushered in a lobbying boom that showered allies, including Wiles, with lucrative contracts, empowered wealthy business associates and stymied his agenda after his administration was ensnared in a series of influence-peddling scandals.",
      "Now, as Trump prepares to return to power, his victory is likely to embolden those who think they can get his ear, raising the prospect that his second administration could face many of the same perils as his first. That will test the ability of Wiles to manage a growing number of high-powered figures \u2014 including Trump\u2019s children, his son-in-law Jared Kushner and billionaires like Elon Musk \u2014 who will not be dependent on her for access to the president.",
      "The appointment of a former lobbyist to such an important job \"bodes very poorly for what we are about to see from the next Trump administration,\u201d said Craig Holman, himself a registered lobbyist for the government watchdog group Public Citizen. \u201cThis time around, Trump didn\u2019t even mention \u2018draining the swamp.\u2019 ... He\u2019s not even pretending.\u201d",
      "In a statement, Brian Hughes, a spokesman from the Trump transition effort, rejected any suggestion that Wiles\u2019 history as a lobbyist would make her susceptible to pressure.",
      "\u201cSusie Wiles has an undeniable reputation of the highest integrity and steadfast commitment to service both inside and outside government,\u201d Hughes said. \u201cShe will bring this same integrity and commitment as she serves President Trump in the White House, and that is exactly why she was selected.\u201d",
      "Wiles\u2019 selection as chief of staff was Trump\u2019s first announced hire after his win. Wiles co-led the former president's campaign and was widely credited with having run an operation that was far more disciplined than his two previous efforts. Even so, she will have her work cut out for her. Though the job has traditionally entailed policing who has access to the president, Trump chaffed at such efforts during his first presidency as he churned through four chiefs of staff.",
      "During his recent victory speech, Trump called Wiles an \u201cIce Maiden\u201d while praising her as a consummate behind-the-scenes player. She will be the first woman to ever hold the position.",
      "What is also clear is that Wiles, 67, has successfully managed headstrong men across a lengthy career in politics, government and lobbying. The daughter of NFL player and sportscaster Pat Summerall, Wiles worked for U.S. Rep. Jack Kemp, a conservative icon, in the 1970s, followed by stints on Ronald Reagan\u2019s campaign and as a scheduler in his White House.",
      "She later headed to Florida, where she advised two Jacksonville mayors and is credited with helping businessman Rick Scott, now a U.S. senator, win the governor\u2019s office. After briefly managing Utah Gov. Jon Huntsman\u2019s 2012 presidential campaign, she oversaw Trump\u2019s 2016 effort in Florida, when his win in the state helped him clinch the White House.",
      "Wiles was a partner at Ballard Partners, a regional firm that lobbied for Trump\u2019s companies in Florida. Shortly after Trump\u2019s election, Ballard set up shop in Washington and quickly became a dominant player, pulling in more than $70 million in lobbying fees during Trump\u2019s presidency, representing a who\u2019s who of corporate America, lobbying disclosures show.",
      "Many of Wiles\u2019 clients were plain vanilla entities with obvious aims \u2014 General Motors, a trade group for children\u2019s hospitals, homebuilders, and the City of Jacksonville, Florida.",
      "One in particular stood out that speaks to the ways, subtle or otherwise, that foreign interests seek to influence U.S. policy. In 2017, Wiles registered as a lobbyist for Globovisi\u00f3n, a Venezuelan TV network owned by Ra\u00fal Gorr\u00edn, a businessman charged in Miami with money laundering.",
      "Gorr\u00edn bought the broadcast company in 2013 and immediately softened its anti-government coverage. He hired Ballard to advise on \u201cgeneral government policies and regulations,\u201d lobbying disclosures show. But rather than working with the agencies that oversee telecommunications, Ballard\u2019s lobbying was trained on the White House, which would have little say in regulating a foreign broadcaster in the U.S. Globovisi\u00f3n paid Ballard $800,000 for a year of work.",
      "Brian Ballard, president of the firm, said that it\u2019s clear to him that Gorr\u00edn\u2019s aims weren\u2019t limited to the media business. Gorr\u00edn, who owns several luxury properties in Miami, had long positioned himself as a bridge between Venezuela\u2019s socialist government and U.S. officials.",
      "By the time Wiles and a team of Ballard lobbyists represented Globovisi\u00f3n, Gorr\u00edn was leading a quiet charm offensive for Nicol\u00e1s Maduro\u2019s government that sought closer ties with Trump at a time when the country was facing food shortages, violent crime and hyperinflation. It started before Trump took office when Citgo, a subsidiary of Venezuela\u2019s state-owned oil company, kicked in a $500,000 donation for Trump\u2019s inauguration.",
      "\u201cHe was a fraud and as soon as we learned he was a fraud, we fired him,\u201d said Ballard. \u201cHe would ask us to set up a lot of things, in LA and D.C., and then nothing would happen. It was all a fantasy. He just wanted to use our firm.\u201d",
      "A few days after Ballard dropped Gorr\u00edn in 2018, federal prosecutors unsealed charges against the businessman for allegedly using the U.S. finance system to supply Venezuelan officials with private jets, a yacht and champion show-jumping horses as part of a fake loan scheme perpetrated by insiders to pilfer the state\u2019s coffers. Last month, he was charged a second time, also out of Miami, in another scheme to siphon $1 billion from the state oil company, PDVSA.",
      "Ballard said Wiles had almost no role in managing the relationship with Gorr\u00edn or several other clients for which she is listed as a lobbyist. But he praised her as someone who is a highly organized \u201cstraight shooter\u201d and \u201ctough as nails\u201d despite her soft demeanor.",
      "\u201cShe\u2019s the type of person who you want in a foxhole,\u201d he said. \u201cShe will serve the president well.\u201d",
      "During Trump\u2019s first term, Maduro engaged in a peacemaking offensive that included attempts to hire at least two other lobbyists. It fizzled out, however. In 2019, the White House slapped crushing oil sanctions on the OPEC nation, closed the U.S. Embassy in Caracas and recognized the head of the opposition-controlled National Assembly as the country\u2019s legitimate ruler. Maduro was then indicted in 2020 by the U.S. Justice Department on federal drug trafficking charges out of New York.",
      "Gorr\u00edn has long denied any wrongdoing and remains a fugitive. In a brief interview with The Associated Press, he called Wiles a \u201clady\u201d and said she always acted professionally and humanely.",
      "Ballard called the firm's work for Gorr\u00edn a \u201cbig mistake.\u201d Going forward, Ballard expects access to the White House to be more tightly controlled just as his firm, after a steep learning curve during the first Trump administration, will do a better job vetting potential clients to make sure their interests align with the president's agenda.",
      "\u201cWe learned a lot,\u201d he says, \u201cand so did the president.\u201d",
      "Globovisi\u00f3n wasn\u2019t Wiles\u2019 only client with foreign ties.",
      "In early 2019, she registered with the Justice Department as a foreign agent working for one of Nigeria\u2019s main political parties for two months. Another client was an auto dealership owned by Shafik Gabr, a wealthy businessman who was in a financial dispute related to selling cars in Egypt with the subsidiary of the German automaker Volkswagen.",
      "Wiles was also a registered lobbyist for the subsidiaries of a multi-national gaming company and a Canadian company looking to build a massive copper and gold mine near Alaska\u2019s salmon-rich Bristol Bay.",
      "Wiles was hardly an outlier in Trump\u2019s Washington, where his eponymously named hotel served as a hub for lobbyists, business leaders and foreign governments looking to rub shoulders with Trump World figures as they sought the president\u2019s favor.",
      "Though much of it was part of the normal course of business in Washington, a number of Trump allies and advisers were investigated and charged with crimes linked to their work on behalf of foreign countries and entities.",
      "After becoming Trump\u2019s de facto campaign manager in 2022, Wiles kept on lobbying, this time for Mercury, a multinational public affairs and lobbying firm. Most recently she was representing the maker of Swisher Sweets cigars.",

      "Tennessee will count the provisional ballots cast by six people convicted of felonies who had their voting rights recently restored under judges\u2019 rulings",
      "NASHVILLE, Tenn. -- Tennessee will count the provisional ballots cast by six people convicted of felonies who had their voting rights recently restored under judges' rulings, but had been placed in limbo after state officials filed a flurry of legal motions arguing that they had to get their gun rights back in order to vote again.",
      "According to letters sent to local election commissions earlier this month, Election Coordinator Mark Goins told officials to count the provisional ballots.",
      "\u201cAlthough other courts have addressed requests for restoration of rights differently and I disagree with the court's order, in this specific case given the timing and the language in this specific order, we must follow the court order, even though it is not final,\u201d Goins wrote in one letter on Nov. 15.",
      "In January, Tennessee's Secretary of State office shocked voting rights advocates when it announced that people convicted of a felony must get their gun rights and other \u201ccitizenship rights\u201d restored before they can become eligible to cast a ballot again.",
      "While explaining their decision, the election office pointed to a 2023 state Supreme Court ruling that said all people convicted of felonies applying for reinstated voting rights first get their \u201cfull citizenship rights\u201d restored by a judge or show they were pardoned by a governor. Gun rights were among those required, the Secretary of State's office determined.",
      "Critics have argued the state's legal interpretation was way off-base, but the state has fiercely defended its position. When a handful of voters sought to cast ballots in the November election despite having been convicted of felony offenses that stripped away their gun rights, they went to court and the judges sided with them. Then the state fought back \u2014 launching several motions for judges to change their decisions.",
      "In one ruling, a judge said \u201cfull rights of citizenship\u201d can still be restored even when someone\u2019s gun rights still have to be barred due to restrictions in state law, citing a 2002 Tennessee Supreme Court ruling. Davidson County Criminal Court Judge Angelita Blackshear Dalton noted that the gun-banning offenses are not among those specified in state law as ineligible for voting rights restoration.",
      "As the case dragged past Election Day, the six voters involved in the lawsuit were told to vote provisionally \u2014 meaning that their ballots would be counted after their voting status was confirmed.",
      "Another Nashville judge ruled similarly on Friday in two voters' restoration cases.",
      "\u201cI do believe that the case law in Tennessee is such that the right to vote can be restored without having to restore the right to bear arms,\u201d Judge Thomas Brothers said in court.",
      "Despite begrudgingly allowing the six voters to cast their provisional ballots, Goins warned election commissions in Davidson, Lewis, Sumner and Wilson counties that the latest court orders were not final.",
      "\u201cThis court order may ultimately be reversed or amended,\u201d Goins wrote. \u201cIf that happens, the voter registration may be subject to being purged.\u201d",

      "The BlueOval SK complex at Glendale is a joint venture between Ford Motor Co. and its South Korean partner, SK On, to produce batteries for Ford and Lincoln electric vehicles. The nearly $6 billion battery park \u2014 about an hour south of Louisville \u2014 is gearing up to start manufacturing in 2025.",

      "LOS ANGELES -- Avid coin collectors jumped at the chance to get their hands on a rare $20 \u201cdouble eagle\u201d gold coin at a Southern California auction house Tuesday afternoon, but only one walked away victorious after paying a hefty price.",
      "The gold piece \u2014 minted in Carson City, Nevada, in 1870 \u2014 sold for $1.44 million including the buyer's premium, a fee paid to the Stack's Bowers Galleries. Only 3,789 of them were produced and an estimated 40 to 50 remain, according to John Kraljevich, who specializes in coin history at the auction house.",
      "The auction house did not give any information about who bought the coin.",
      "Prior to 1849, the highest denomination for a gold coin was $10, known as the eagle. The $20 double eagle was authorized after the California Gold Rush brought an abundance of gold supply, Kraljevich said.",
      "The last time this specific coin was sold was at a Stack\u2019s auction in 1986 for $23,100.",
      "\u201cThis thing was totally off everybody's radar,\u201d Kraljevich said. \u201cWhen this thing appeared kind of out of the woodwork after being off the market for 25 years, 30 years, it was almost like a new discovery.\u201d",
      "By the time the live auction reached the coin, the bid price had already reached $800,850, far outpacing the other coins in the catalogue. It was sold from the Bernard Richards collection and is the finest grade coin of its type known to exist, according to the industry standard Professional Coin Grading Service. However, it fell short of the auction's prediction that it would break the $2 million barrier.",
      "The second finest coin was sold in an auction for $1.62 million in November 2021. The price of collector's coins went up substantially during the COVID-19 pandemic, as people turned to investing in their hobbies, Kraljevich said.",
      "The value of the gold itself, which in the coin is just under one ounce, is worth roughly $2,600."

      "NEW YORK -- Moving to stabilize an administration roiled by investigations, resignations and his own indictment, New York City Mayor Eric Adams on Wednesday appointed sanitation chief Jessica Tisch as police commissioner. A city government stalwart and ex-NYPD official, she'll be just the second woman in the high-profile, high-pressure post.",
      "The move comes at a critical time for the nation\u2019s largest police department, shoring up its leadership after a tumultuous stretch punctuated by former commissioner Edward Caban's exit in September amid a federal investigation. Days later, his interim replacement, Thomas Donlon, disclosed that he, too, had been searched by the FBI.",
      "Tisch, 43, the Harvard-educated scion of a wealthy New York family, has worked for the city for 16 years, holding leadership roles in several agencies. As sanitation commissioner, she became TikTok famous when she declared in 2022, \u201cThe rats don\u2019t run the city, we do.\u201d",
      "\u201cI need someone that\u2019s going to take the police department into the next century,\u201d Adams said, praising Tisch as a \u201cvisionary\u201d and lauding her track record of improving city operations.",
      "Tisch said she believes \u201cvery deeply in the nobility of the police and the profession of policing\u201d and is \u201clooking forward to coming home.\u201d",
      "Tisch's first job in city government was in the NYPD\u2019s counterterrorism bureau. As planning and policy director, she helped shape post-9/11 security infrastructure, deploying mobile radiation detectors and helping develop a digital information-sharing tool with instant access to surveillance cameras and license-plate readers.",
      "As deputy commissioner for information technology, she spearheaded use of body-worn cameras and smartphones, transformed 911 dispatching, introduced a gunshot-detection system and worked with the city\u2019s transit agency to make police radios work in the subway.",
      "\u201cOnce I started, I never wanted to stop,\u201d Tisch told a Harvard alumni publication last year.",
      "Tisch\u2019s tenure has transcended three mayors: Michael Bloomberg, Bill de Blasio and Adams.",
      "In 2019, after more than a decade at the NYPD, de Blasio appointed her to run the city's technology agency. When the COVID-19 pandemic hit the following year, she had a key role in the city\u2019s response, managing the digital infrastructure that facilitated a rapid shift to remote work, learning and online services.",
      "As Sanitation Commissioner since 2022, Tisch led what the department calls a \u201cTrash Revolution\u201d aimed at improving cleanliness, reducing stench and eliminating rats. The city finally started requiring trash bags be placed in bins for pickup \u2014 something other cities had done for years.",
      "Before Wednesday's announcement, Tisch was testifying at a City Council hearing on the bin requirements \u2014 her last act as Sanitation Commissioner. About 90 minutes in, she said she had a \u201chard stop\u201d and had to leave without giving any indication of the new job.",
      "Tisch\u2019s family wealth has led to criticism that she\u2019s a nepo baby \u2014 or, rather, a nepo appointee.",
      "Adams pushed back on that, saying Wednesday that Tisch \u201cdoes not have to be in city government. She\u2019s here because of the love of the city.\u201d",
      "Tisch's father, James S. Tisch, is president and CEO of Loews Corporation, the conglomerate that owns Loews Hotels and CNA Financial. Her mother, Merryl Tisch, is former chancellor of the state Board of Regents, which supervises education.",
      "Her late grandfather, Laurence Tisch, once led CBS. Her cousins are co-owners of the NFL\u2019s Giants. The family has given millions of dollars to cultural and academic institutions and is the namesake of New York University\u2019s Tisch School of the Arts.",
      "Her husband, Daniel Levine, is a venture capitalist. They have two sons.",
      "Closer to her new job, her uncle Andrew Tisch and cousin Alexander Tisch, are on the board of the New York City Police Foundation, a nonprofit that funds some NYPD work, including stationing counterterrorism officers in more than dozen cities worldwide, and the Crime Stoppers tip reward program.",
      "Tisch told the Harvard Law Bulletin that it was a friend that led her to public service.",
      "She graduated in 2008 with law and Master of Business Administration degrees, but the \u201cfinancial crisis was hitting, and I thought it\u2019d be difficult to find a job,\u201d Tisch told the publication in 2019.",
      "\u201cA friend said: \u2018Why don\u2019t you go work at the NYPD? I know someone there.\u2019 I said, \u2018I can\u2019t even imagine what someone like me would do at the Police Department,\u2019\u201d Tisch said.",
      "David Cohen, then deputy commissioner of counterterrorism, suggested Tisch work for him \u2014 leading to her first job as planning and policy director.",
      "Tisch recalled telling him: \u201cI don\u2019t know. Counterterrorism sounds really scary. I\u2019m more into \u2018Law & Order\u2019 kind of stuff.\u201d",
      "But, she said, Cohen told her: \u201cTrust me, this will be right for you.\u201d",
      "As deputy commissioner of information technology from 2014 to 2019, she helped modernize the department while navigating \u2014 and pushing back at \u2014 criticism of her decision to equip officers with smartphones using the unpopular Windows Phone operating system.",
      "After the New York Post derided the decision in 2017 as a costly boondoggle, Tisch explained in a blog post that she chose the phones because they integrated with existing department technology, enabling faster emergency responses while putting vital data at officers' fingertips. At the time, she wrote, the project was 45% under budget and the phones and their iPhone replacements were provided at no cost.",
      "Tisch ran into trouble again when she loaned an ex-NYPD colleague $75,000 for law school and later forgave the debt after that person was rehired, transferred to her supervision and given a pay increase. The city\u2019s Conflicts of Interest Board fined her $2,000.",
      "Now she\u2019s taking charge of a department in yet more chaos.",
      "Adams\u2019 first commissioner, Keechant Sewell, made history as the first woman in the post but resigned last year, just 18 months into her tenure, amid speculation that he was undermining her authority.",
      "Under her replacement, Caban, the NYPD tacked more lenient in disciplining officers and more aggressive in taking on criticism. Some top deputies posted social media screeds targeting critics and reporters, or castigated them in person or on the phone. The department even ditched its longtime slogan \u2014 \u201cCourtesy, Professionalism, Respect\u201d \u2014 for one focused on crimefighting and public safety.",

      "Thames Water chief executive Chris Weston previously warned that the company only has enough cash to survive till next May but many think it will run out of money by Christmas.",
      "The announcement will come as part of an Ofwat update into executive pay and financial resilience across the sector.",
      "Ofwat has new powers to prevent bonuses being funded from customer bills if the company is judged to have missed environmental or performance targets.",

      "It's not clear whether the bonus has in fact been paid out, but the regulator will insist that it is not paid by the operating company, and must be borne by the company owners. Thames Water declined to comment.",
      "In expectation of this approach other companies \u2013 including debt laden Southern Water - have already said shareholders rather than customers would pay bonuses to executives.",

      "They walked away, effectively leaving the company under the control of its lenders.",
      "The majority of those lenders to Thames have offered to throw it a financial lifeline loan of up to \u00a33bn at high interest rates to tide it over till next year in the hope that Ofwat will agree to bill rises as high as 50% to encourage new investors to inject over \u00a33 billion needed to get its debt levels stabilised.",
      "The lenders are currently finalising proposals for a restructuring of the company which would involve them taking a discount on the money they are owed, bringing in new operational expertise, and exploring the possibility of a break up and or public listing of the company.",
      "Yesterday, environment secretary Steve Reed, who was appearing before MPs, once again ruled out the nationalisation of Thames.",

    "title": "Is nuclear power gaining new energy?",
    "published": "Thu, 21 Nov 2024 00:03:04 GMT",
    "summary": "Countries around the world are building new nuclear power stations.",
    "story": [
      "A decade ago, it seemed as though the global nuclear industry was in an irreversible decline.",
      "Concerns over safety, cost, and what to do with radioactive waste had sapped enthusiasm for a technology once seen as a revolutionary source of abundant cheap energy.",
      "Yet now there is widespread talk of a revival, fuelled by tech giants Microsoft, Google and Amazon all announcing investments in the sector, as well as the growing pressures on wealthy nations to curb their carbon emissions.",
      "But how real is the comeback?",
      "When commercial nuclear power was first developed in the 1950s and 1960s, governments were seduced by its seemingly unlimited potential.",
      "Nuclear reactors could harness and control the same awesome forces released by atomic bombs - to provide electricity for millions of homes. With a single kilogram of uranium yielding some 20,000 times as much energy as a kilogram of coal, it seemed like the future.",
      "But the technology also inspired public fear. And that fear seemed to be justified by the Chernobyl disaster, which spread radioactive contamination across Europe in early 1986.",
      "It fuelled widespread public and political opposition \u2013 and slowed the growth of the industry.",
      "Another accident, at the Fukushima Daichi plant in Japan in 2011, re-energised concerns about nuclear safety. Japan itself shut down all of its reactors in the immediate aftermath, and only 12 have since restarted.",
      "Germany decided to phase out nuclear power altogether. Other countries scaled back plans to invest in new power plants, or extend the lives of ageing facilities.",
      "According to the International Atomic Energy Agency, this led to the loss of 48GW of electric power generation globally between 2011 and 2020.",
      "But nuclear development did not stop. In China, for example, there were 13 nuclear reactors in 2011. There are now 55, with another 23 under construction.",
      "For Beijing, scrambling to meet rapidly growing electricity demand, nuclear had, and still has, a vital role to play.",
      "Now interest in the sector seems to be growing elsewhere once again. This is partly because developed countries are hunting for ways to meet energy demand, while striving to meet emissions reduction targets under the Paris Agreement.",
      "With 2024 projected to be the warmest year on record, the pressure to cut carbon emissions is mounting. A renewed focus on energy security, in the wake of Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, has also been a factor.",
      "South Korea, for example, recently scrapped plans to phase out its large fleet of nuclear power stations over the next four decades \u2013 and will build more instead.",
      "And France has reversed plans to reduce its own reliance on nuclear energy, which provides 70% of its electricity. Instead, it wants to build up to eight new reactors.",
      "In addition, last week the US government reaffirmed at the United Nations Climate Change Conference, or Cop29, held in Azerbaijan, that it intends to triple nuclear power generation by 2050.",
      "The White House had originally pledged to do this on the side lines of last year's conference, Cop28. A total of 31 countries have now agreed to try to triple their use of nuclear power by 2050, including the UK, France and Japan.",
      "Also at Cop29, which ends on Friday, 22 November, the US and UK announced that they would collaborate to speed up the development of new nuclear power technology.",
      "This follows after it was agreed in the final statement or \u201cstocktake\u201d of last year's Cop28 that nuclear should be one of the zero or low emission technologies to be \u201caccelerated\u201d to help combat climate change.",
      "But hunger for clean power is not just coming from governments. Technology giants are striving to develop more and more applications that use artificial intelligence.",
      "Yet AI relies on data \u2013 and data centres need constant, reliable electricity. According to Barclays Research, data centres account for 3.5% of electricity consumption in the US today, but that figure could rise to more than 9% by the end of the decade.",
      "In September, Microsoft signed a 20-year deal to buy power from Constellation Energy, which will lead to the reopening of the infamous Three Mile Island power station in Pennsylvania \u2013 the site of the worst nuclear accident in US history, where a reactor suffered a partial meltdown in 1979.",
      "Despite its tainted public image, another reactor at the plant continued to generate electricity until 2019. Constellation\u2019s chief executive Joe Dominguez described the deal to reopen it as a \"powerful symbol of the rebirth of nuclear power as a clean and reliable energy resource\".",
      "Other tech giants have taken a different approach. Google plans to buy energy produced from a handful of so-called Small Modular Reactors or SMRs \u2013 a nascent technology intended to make nuclear energy easier and cheaper to deploy. Amazon is also supporting SMR development and construction.",
      "SMRs themselves are being promoted, in part, as a solution to one of the biggest drawbacks facing nuclear power today. In western nations, new power stations have to be built to exacting modern safety standards. This makes them prohibitively expensive and complicated to build.",
      "Hinkley Point C is a good example. Britain\u2019s first new nuclear power station since the mid-1990s is being built on a stretch of remote coastline in southwest England.",
      "It is meant to be the first of a batch of new plants to replace the country\u2019s ageing reactor fleet. But the project is running some five years behind schedule and will cost up to \u00a39bn ($11.5bn) more than planned.",
      "It is not an isolated case. The US\u2019s newest reactors at Plant Vogtle in Georgia opened seven years late, and cost more than $35bn \u2013 well over double their original budget.",
      "SMRs are designed to solve this problem. They will be smaller than traditional reactors, using standardised parts that can be assembled quickly, at sites close to where the power is needed.",
      "But while there are some 80 different designs under development globally, according to the International Atomic Energy Agency, the concept has yet to be proven commercially.",
      "Opinions about nuclear power remain highly polarised. Supporters claim the technology is indispensable if climate targets are to be reached. Among them is Rod Adams, whose Nucleation Capital fund promotes investment in nuclear technology.",
      "\u201cNuclear fission has a seven-decade history showing it is one of the safest power sources available,\" he explains.",
      "\u201cIt is a durable, reliable source of power with low ongoing costs already, but capital costs have been too high in Western countries.\"",
      "Opponents though, insist nuclear power is not the answer.",
      "According to Professor M.V. Ramana of the University of British Columbia, it is \u201ca folly to consider nuclear energy as clean\u201d.  It is, he says, \"one of the most expensive ways to generate electricity. Investing in cheaper low-carbon sources of energy will provide more emissions reductions per dollar.\"",
      "If current trends do herald a new nuclear age, one old problem remains. After 70 years of atomic power, there is still disagreement over what to do with the accumulated radioactive waste - some of which will remain hazardous for hundreds of thousands of years.",
      "The answer being pursued by many governments is geological disposal - burying the waste in sealed tunnels deep underground. But only one country, Finland, has actually built such a facility, while environmentalists and anti-nuclear campaigners argue that dumping waste out of sight and out of mind is simply too risky.",
      "Solving that conundrum may be a key factor in dictating whether there really will be a new age of nuclear power.",

    "published": "Wed, 20 Nov 2024 16:47:06 GMT",
    "summary": "The government wants to address the loss of social housing, but critics say more action is needed.",
    "story": [
      "More social housing tenants could be stopped from buying their own homes as part of a shake up of Right to Buy policy.",
      "Under the proposals, tenants may have to wait more than ten years to buy their homes and those living in newly built social homes may never be able to buy.",
      "The government also wants to cut Right to Buy discounts back to pre-2012 levels and discourage social tenants from selling the homes they have bought.",
      "Housing Secretary Angela Rayner said its changes will address the loss of social housing, but the Conservatives said Labour is \"limiting aspiration and social mobility\".",
      "Since the Right to Buy policy was introduced in 1980, almost every year has seen a net loss in social housing stock as successive governments have failed to replace the housing that has been bought or demolished.",
      "There are 1.4 million fewer English households in social housing than there were in 1980, according Shelter's analysis.",
      "\"Too many social homes have been sold off before they can be replaced, which has directly contributed to the worst housing crisis in living memory,\" said Rayner.",
      "\u201cWe cannot fix the crisis without addressing this issue \u2013 it\u2019s like trying to fill a bath when the plug\u2019s not in.\"",
      "Policy proposals",
      "The housing department has proposed increasing the minimum amount of time tenants have to live in their social home before buying them from the current three years.",
      "It was reduced to three years from five years in 2014, but the government is seeking views on whether to raise it to five years, 10 years, or more than 10 years.",
      "It is also considering banning tenants from buying any newly built social housing.",
      "Currently, tenants can buy housing that is more than three years old, but it has proposed increasing the length of time newly built social housing is protected from being bought to between 10 and 30 years or \"permanently\".",
      "It also wants to reduce the maximum discounts for tenants using Right to Buy to between \u00a316,000 and \u00a338,000 depending on the council - bringing them back to pre-2012 levels.",
      "Under the current rules, tenants have to repay this discount to the council if they then sell the property on within five years of buying. The government wants to extend this to 10 years.",
      "The measures come after the government announced other changes to Right to Buy in the Budget, including allowing councils to spend all of the money they get from a Right to Buy sale on buying or building new social housing rather than just half.",
      "'Vital but not enough'",
      "Not everyone supports Labour's Right to Buy reforms. Shadow housing secretary Kevin Hollinrake accused the government of \"pulling up the drawbridge on home ownership and limiting aspiration and social mobility\".",
      "\"The Right to Buy has helped millions into home ownership. It has given something back to families who worked hard, paid their rent, and played by the rules,\" he said.",
      "Meanwhile, Shelter chief executive Polly Neate said Right to Buy reform was \"vital... but not enough on its own\", adding that the changes \"must be combined with serious investment in social homes in the Spring Spending Review\".",
      "Rayner has made social housing her mission in government, having previously told the BBC she wants to see \"the biggest wave of council housing in a generation and that is what I want to be measured on\".",
      "Some have urged the government to be more radical on Help to Buy with Manchester mayor Andy Burnham calling for it to be \"suspended\" while others have called for it to be scrapped entirely.",

      "The inflation rate, which charts the rising cost of living, increased to 2.3% in October.",
      "Prices aren't soaring at the rate seen over recent times. Inflation peaked at 11.1% two years ago. But, there is concern about the impact the situation is having, and will have, on people's finances.",
      "Here are four ways these figures affect you.",
      "1. The cost of living crisis isn't over",
      "Any trip to the supermarket reminds us that prices have risen sharply in recent years.",
      "Compared with October 2020, prices of goods and services are 24% higher  - driven by increases in food and energy prices.",
      "That shows the ongoing impact of price rises over the last few years, irrespective of what's happening now.",
      "While high inflation is considered harmful, a small amount of inflation is considered necessary to drive economic growth.",

      "Wages are rising at a faster rate, offsetting some of these prices increases, but charities' worries are growing about those on benefits.",
      "Most working-age benefits, such as Universal Credit, will go up by 1.7% in April - which analysts predict will be below the pace at which prices are rising.",
      "Lots of people are still struggling to pay back debts that built up over the last few years. Some \u00a33.7bn is collectively owed to energy suppliers from people unable to pay their gas and electricity bills, for example.",
      "2. Inflation is volatile",
      "Analysts had expected a smaller rise in inflation than 2.3%.",
      "But you shouldn't put too much store on a one-month figure.",
      "As with any economic statistic, one month's data can buck a general trend and should be considered alongside other published data.",
      "It is worth noting too that some of the factors driving the latest rise in prices came from outside of the UK.",
      "Higher energy costs are primarily the result of price of energy on the global markets, but which have an impact on households' and businesses' bills.",
      "3. Interest rate cuts will be more gradual",
      "Interest rates affect the cost of borrowing and the returns available for savers.",
      "The benchmark - or base - rate, set by the Bank of England currently stands at 4.75%. It was cut from 5% earlier this month.",
      "This is the chief tool used by the Bank to try to keep inflation at its 2% target. Raising rates cools borrowing and spending, thus limiting price rises, and vice versa.",
      "With inflation much lower than its peak, the Bank has - and still is - expected to reduce interest rates.",
      "But recent events, such as the Budget and now a higher-than-expected inflation rate, mean the markets have revised their predictions for when and how often those cuts will come.",
      "Even the Bank's governor cautioned they could not be cut \"too quickly or by too much\u201d, prompting forecasts that the base rate is unlikely to be reduced in December.",
      "The impact for homeowners is that fixed mortgage rates have actually been creeping up, despite the latest interest rate cut.",
      "Official figures show the cost of renting a home has also risen. Average rent paid to private landlords was up 8.7% in year to October, the ONS says.",
      "Savers, however, may see the interest paid on their savings hold up better than would otherwise be the case.",
      "4. We don't know what will happen next",
      "Global and domestic factors will have a significant impact on how quickly prices rise, but how they will play out remains uncertain.",
      "Donald Trump's victory in the US presidential election was helped by his decision to tap into voters' concerns about the cost of living, analysts have suggested.",
      "He has pledged a blanket 20% tariff on all imports into the US.",
      "If he goes ahead and introduces tariffs - a tax imposed by one country on the goods and services imported from another - it could lead to a rise in prices, including in the UK, economists say.",
      "Domestically, measures in the Budget, such as a rise in National Insurance paid by employers, has led to fears that the extra cost could be passed on in higher prices or fewer jobs.",
      "However, other events could have a positive impact. A swift, relatively orderly, end to conflicts such as the war in Ukraine could settle the global economic outlook - albeit the impact of such geopolitical complexity is extremely difficult to call.",

      "To be clear, recent developments have not fundamentally altered the expectation of a series of rate cuts next year, but perhaps by the end of 2025 rates will be around 4% from their current 4.75%, rather than previous expectations of them being lower.",
      "Beyond this, there is a chance that if the geopolitical situation calms, that over the course of this year, gas prices fall significantly. That is a very big \u201cif\u201d, but it is weighing on the minds of energy suppliers.",

      "\"You try to leave [work] early, to get an earlier one, or you wait until you get one after about half past six, which you don't want to do, obviously,\" she said.",
      "Another passenger said Northern was \"absolutely diabolical\".",
      "\"I catch this train every single day,\" he said. \"It either doesn't turn up on time, or doesn't turn up full stop,\" he said. \"We've got dirty old rolling stock. It's a sham, it really is.\"",
      "Passenger Lisa Greenhalgh said she gets to the station 20 minutes early, and has then waited an hour and forty minutes for a train \"on a number of occasions in the freezing cold, and you've had no update, so you don't know what's happening, and by then it's too late to drive into Manchester, so you end up spending two hours out of the house and actually getting nowhere.\"",

      "Lutnick had also been in the running for treasury secretary, a more high-profile role.",
      "Trump has yet to make a decision about that closely watched post, which has sweeping authority in areas such as economic and tax policy.",
      "The fight over whom to pick has spilled into public view. Over the weekend,  billionaire Elon Musk promoted Lutnick for the position and criticised one of the alternative candidates, Scott Bessent, as too \"business as usual\".",
      "Lutnick, a self-described \"strong capitalist\", has praised Trump for offering a \"competitive growth model\".",

      "He said Lutnick would also have special responsibility for the office of the US Trade Representative, which is not officially part of the Commerce department.",
      "Who is Howard Lutnick?",
      "Lutnick, a native of Long Island, New York, is a long-time Republican and supporter of Trump, with whom he overlapped in the New York social scene. He appeared on Trump's reality TV show, The Apprentice, in 2008, according to the online film and television database imdb.",
      "He joined Cantor Fitzgerald right after his 1983 graduation from Haverford College, which he attended on scholarship. He lost both of his parents as a teenager - his mother to cancer and his father to a medical mistake.",
      "Within 10 years, he rose to be president and chief executive of the firm. It is known today in part for its investments in crypto and its affiliate in the property industry, the Newmark brokerage.",
      "Lutnick's public profile rose after the September 11 attacks, which killed more than 600 people working in the company\u2019s offices that morning, including his brother. He was not at work because he was taking one of his children to kindergarten.",
      "Lutnick, who speaks with a New York accent and is known for his blustery style, wept on TV in the days after.",
      "Twenty years later, in an interview with the Wall Street Journal, he said the day was a dividing line in his life, \u201cbefore 9/11 and after\u201d and for years following \u201cit was still so raw it felt like yesterday\u201d."

      "The prime minister said he understood farmers' concerns and \"wants to support\" them but added \"the vast majority\" would be unaffected.",
      "From April 2026, inherited agricultural assets worth more than \u00a31m, which were previously exempt, will be liable to the tax at 20% - half the usual inheritance tax rate.",
      "Other allowances could mean a couple who are married or in a civil partnership could pass on a farm worth as much as \u00a33m.",

      "The farming tax row explained",
      "Watch: BBC Verify explains the inheritance tax row",
      "How many farms would be affected by Budget changes?",
      "However, many farmers argue that while they are asset rich - for example in terms of their land and livestock - they are cash poor and the changes would mean they would have to sell up to be able to pay the tax.",
      "Ahead of the protest, around 1,800 National Farmers' Union (NFU) members met near Parliament as part of a mass lobby of MPs.",
      "The group's president, Tom Bradshaw, gave an impassioned speech describing the tax changes as destructive, a \"stab in the back\" for farmers, wrong and unacceptable.",
      "He told protesters the changes were the \"straw that broke the camel's back\".",
      "Later, speaking to Sky News, he said Labour had \"destroyed\" a \"contract\" between farming and the government dating back to World War Two.",
      "\"We'd love to pay more tax,\" Mr Bradshaw added.",
      "\"If we get proper margins from food production, and we end up swelling the Treasury coffers, bring it on.",
      "\"But at the moment the supply chain doesn't give us those returns that enables us to save the money to pay the inheritance tax that this government now wants to take.\"",
      "He added that Environment Secretary Steve Reed said when he was in opposition that Labour would not change agricultural property relief.",
      "Since 2019, pig farming costs have risen by 54%, cattle by 44% and cereal by 43%, as food, fuel and fertiliser prices increase at a rate far outstripping the increases farmers can charge on what they produce. Subsidies that farmers get have also been declining since Brexit.",
      "Government research suggests that an average farm last year made a profit of about \u00a345,300 - although that figure may be overstated as it is based on a survey that excluded farms that bring in the least money.",
      "The number of the UK's 210,000 farms that could be affected by the inheritance tax change is also disputed.",
      "The government says it will affect the wealthiest 500 estates each year, but the NFU and the Country Land and Business Association (CLA) have estimated up to 70,000 farms worth more than \u00a31m could be affected.",
      "Between 2021 and 2022, 117 farms with a value of more than \u00a32.5m were inherited.",
      "Reed told the Commons Rural Affairs Committee on Tuesday that many farmers protesting over the tax changes were \"wrong\" about the policy - and he rejected claims the government had underestimated how many people would be affected.",
      "\"Many of them, probably happily, are wrong because there are things that they can do to plan their tax affairs as most businesses or asset owners would do to limit their liability,\" he said.",
      "He said: \"The numbers I've heard bandied around are enormous and very, very frightening if people were to believe them.\"",
      "He acknowledged the changes would be \"unsettling\" and said he was \"listening\" to concerns, but insisted that most farmers would not face a hike.",
      "Among those attending Tuesday's events was Gloucestershire livestock farmer David Barton, who estimates his business - which has been in the family since 1913 - is worth around \u00a35m in assets, but says it doesn't make much money year-on-year.",
      "Mr Barton is worried the proposed changes to inheritance tax could see his son facing a \u00a3800,000 bill and said the Budget \"has just ripped the heart out of us\".",
      "He is now considering gifting his estate, which he believes would fall outside of inheritance tax if he does not die within seven years, but feared he was not in a financial position to stop working.",
      "Others at the protest said they would have to sell their farms to pay the tax bills.",
      "Jen, a seventh-generation farmer from Yorkshire, who did not give her surname, told the PA news agency: \"If the Budget goes through, then that means I won't be able to take her over my family farm because between me and my brother, we would have to sell up to be able to pay the tax.",
      "\"It's something we've both been passionate about from when we were little kids, ever since we could walk, always been involved - it's a lifestyle.\"",
      "The 24-year-old said they would have to pay approximately \u00a31.2m.",
      "\"We have spoken to our accountant, solicitors, and once something happens to our parents - unless there is some change, unless there's something we can do - then it's not possible for us,\" she said.",
      "Jeremy Clarkson, who owns Diddly Squat Farm in Oxfordshire - which features in the Amazon series Clarkson's Farm - said he thought the change to inheritance tax was \"a very rushed last-minute decision\".",
      "\"I think we all make mistakes in life, and I think it's time for them to say 'you know what, we've cocked this one up a bit' and back down.\"",
      "BBC Newsnight\u2019s Victoria Derbyshire asked Mr Clarkson at the protest about his motivation for attending the rally: \u201cSo, it\u2019s not about you, it\u2019s not about your farm and the fact you bought a farm to avoid inheritance tax?\u201d",
      "Criticising the question as \u201cClassic BBC\", Mr Clarkson said: \"I wanted to shoot... which comes with the benefit of not having to pay inheritance tax. Now I do. But people like me will simply put it [money] in a trust.",

      "He said \u00a35bn had been pledged over two years \"in farming and food sustainability. That's hugely important for farmers, an additional amount for flooding that impacts them and on disease outbreak\".",

      "One family told the BBC that the housing shortage - affecting availability and affordability - has pushed them to the point of \"giving up\".",
      "The irony is not lost on Dee Goddard, who grew up \"down south\", when she says that she originally moved to the area because \"we thought it would be a cheaper option\".",
      "The 31-year-old has lived in the Derbyshire Dales, in the village of Curbar, with her son and husband Baris for a couple of years.",
      "Dee and her husband, who both work at the University of Sheffield, currently spend more than 50% of their income on rent and council tax, excluding bills, so saving for the future - as well as finding a suitable home to buy - has proven \"very difficult\".",
      "\"We have a one-year-old son, we'd love for him to grow up here, all our friends are here, we're very embedded in the local community, we attend church here, but it's really difficult to find anything that's affordable,\" she says.",

      "\"I have notifications on my phone of the properties that become available, and there are just so few,\" she says. \"At the moment it's just impossible - we're being priced out.\"",
      "'It's really quiet'",

      "And recent figures from Derbyshire Dales District Council show there were 35,595 residential properties in the area in May 2024. In October, 1,053 of these were second homes, while 1,302 were holiday lets.",
      "However, in some villages in the Dales, the Local Democracy Reporting Service (LDRS) says second homes and holiday lets make up a quarter of all residential units.",
      "The LDRS also recently quoted a report in The Times and Inside Airbnb, which found the district had one of the strongest concentrations of Airbnbs in the Midlands.",
      "Dee says: \"Tourism benefits everyone - there's local jobs promoted by tourism - but at what cost?",
      "\"A couple of the houses near us are all holiday homes, so it's really quiet. There aren't people at the play group for me to hang out with, because there aren't people here.",
      "\"We have to think about the balance between tourism and people actually living in the villages that give them their soul and heart, because people otherwise are going to be visiting and there will be no village community for them to enjoy.\"",

      "She says: \"We get quite a few people who look round the school, who think they are going to move into the local area.",
      "\"Then, they cannot find anywhere to rent and certainly cannot find anywhere to buy, and they have to go elsewhere. That makes it difficult to predict how many children we are going to have in the school the following year and that affects the budget.\"",
      "While there is clearly an appetite from families to buy, plenty of others want to holiday in the Dales and are looking for places to stay.",
      "Among those are self-catered holiday homes, and Justin Heslop - the director of Peak Venues - has about 75 of them across the Peak District.",
      "He says: \"The self-catering holiday cottage market is essential to the local economy and area.",
      "\"There are thousands of people who come every week, as we know when you're at home, you're not going out to the cafes, pubs, restaurants three or four times a week, but the people that come to holiday cottages do - and I think without those, the businesses would be really struggling.\"",
      "Visit Peak District and Derbyshire claims tourism is worth \u00a32.89bn to the Peak District and Derbyshire, supporting 28,000 direct jobs.",
      "Speaking about his properties, Justin says his firm's unique selling point is catering for large celebrations.",
      "He says: \"We realised that there were some big properties that no-one really wants because of energy costs etc., and if you've got a party for 30 or 40 people, you can't do that in your own home, so I don't think we're necessarily taking houses off the market for the people that need them.\"",
      "A number of measures and restrictions have been suggested, including Derbyshire Dales District Council voting to increase council tax for people with second homes - but not holiday cottages.",
      "Other restrictions - backed by the previous Conservative government - would make it mandatory for homeowners to apply for planning permission to turn their property into a holiday let.",
      "The district council has urged the new Labour administration to bring this legislation to the House of Commons.",
      "Meanwhile, Airbnb has also backed proposed rule changes, but claimed travel via the US online rental platform had generated \u00a326m and supported more than 425 jobs in the Dales last year.",
      "Justin believes that measures would balance things out.",
      "\"A lot of people came into this market in Covid, when there was a lot of demand because people were not going abroad,\" he says.",
      "\"With the registration... it needs to be really thought [out] and not us v them, it wants to be people from my industry and people from the authorities looking at what can be done best.\"",
      "One district councillor told a recent meeting he was aware of a property owner who spends just two days a year in the area, living the rest of the time in Chicago.",
      "Fellow district councillor Peter O'Brien, who represents the Hathersage ward, said the authority had urged the new Labour government and Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner - who has the housing brief as part of her portfolio - to bring the previously-proposed legislation into operation.",
      "He says: \"At the moment there is no restriction on anyone turning their house into a holiday home or a second home. In places like Eyam, we have got somewhere between 15% and 20% of the dwellings not in permanent habituation.\"",
      "He says if people had to apply for planning permission to turn a property into a holiday home, it would \"give control\" to communities to get the right balance between providing accommodation, housing for local people and encouraging tourism.",
      "\"Tourism is a vital part of our local economy, but if we let it go too far in that direction, we end up with our communities being hollowed out,\" he says.",
      "In a statement to the BBC, the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government said: \"We know large numbers of holiday lets can have significant impacts on areas like Derbyshire. That is why we are introducing a registration scheme for short-term lets and removing tax incentives for landlords to protect communities.",
      "\"However, we recognise that more needs to be done, which is why we are considering additional powers for councils to enable them to respond to pressures created by short-term lets.\"",
      "In response, Peter O'Brien pledged to continue to press the government to use planning laws to regulate the holiday home industry.",
      "For Dee Goddard, she hopes people in the future will not be in her position.",
      "\"The holiday homes themselves aren't that bad, it's just the number of them,\" she says.",
      "\"The question really is - what do the holiday homes lead to? And if they lead to more empty villages, our schools closing down, then it's not worth it.\"",

      "\"It was not that successful - most of the saplings died,\" he says.",
      "Squirrels appeared to be making the situation worse by grabbing cocoa bean pods and eating them.",

      "One of the most high-profile casualties is Lilium.",
      "The German company had developed a radical take on the EVTOL theme.",
      "Lilium's aircraft uses 30 electric jets that can be tilted in unison to swing between vertical lift and forward flight.",
      "The concept proved attractive, with the company claiming to have orders and memoranda of understanding for 780 jets from around the world.",
      "It was able to demonstrate the technology using a remote controlled scale model. Construction had begun on the first full-sized jets, and testing had been due to begin in early 2025.",
      "As recently as the Farnborough Airshow in July, Lilium\u2019s COO Sebastian Borel was sounding confident.",
      "\u201cWe are definitely burning through cash,\" he told the BBC. \u201cBut this is a good sign, because it means we are producing the aircraft. We\u2019re going to have three aircraft in production by the end of the year, and we have also raised \u20ac1.5bn\u201d.",

      "The company has made progress. After completing a programme of remote-controlled testing, it began carrying out piloted tests earlier this year. Initially, these were carried out with the aircraft tethered to the ground. In early November, it carried out its first untethered take-off and landing.",
      "But there have also been serious setbacks. In August last year, a remotely-piloted prototype was badly damaged when it crashed during testing at Cotswold Airport, after a propeller blade fell off.",

      "Yet financial strains have been intensifying. Mr Fitzpatrick invested an extra $25m into the company in March. But a further $25m, due in August if alternative investment could not be found, has not been paid. As of September, Vertical had $57.4m on hand \u2013 but it expects to burn through nearly double that over the coming year.",
      "Hopes for the future appear to be pinned on doing a deal with the American financier Jason Mudrick, who is already a major creditor through his firm Mudrick Capital Management.",
      "He has offered to invest $75m into the business \u2013 and has warned the board of Vertical that rejecting his plan would inevitably lead to insolvency proceedings. But the move has been resisted by Mr Fitzpatrick, who would lose control of the company he founded.",

      "\"Therefore we will announce that funding in the group budget papers in due course.\u201d",
      "Khan launched the scheme in 2023 as a one-year emergency measure to help families with the cost of living, paid for using higher than expected business rate receipts.",
      "In January this year, he announced that he had extended it for a further 12 months, to cover the 2024-25 academic year. It was again funded largely using business rate receipts which were \u201cmore buoyant than we expected\u201d.",
      "The committee heard that the GLA and mayor would have to wait until next year when the government is due to set out its multi-year plans for local government funding before setting budgets for the mayor\u2019s manifesto pledges.",
      "The mayor\u2019s chief of staff David Bellamy told the assembly\u2019s budget committee the free school meals scheme was \"not something substantively that the GLA mayoral budget has the resources to do, so that is something we will be dealing with in the group budget from the total income sources available to the mayor - we will set that out in the draft budget in January\u201d.",
      "'Positive impact'",
      "The research published by Impact on Urban Health, a group which forms part of the Guy\u2019s & St Thomas\u2019 Foundation, found that \u201cparents, whatever their household income, welcomed the policy and wanted it to continue\u201d, as \u201cthey felt it countered the effects of the rising cost of living and, in many cases, had a positive impact on family life\u201d.",
      "The scheme had also been \u201cvalued highly by those working in schools\u201d, the report found, with senior leaders saying it had \u201chelped to address the problems of hidden hunger and food insecurity\u201d.",
      "According to data collected by City Hall, in a sample of 259 schools \u2013 making up 13% of London primary schools \u2013 the scheme\u2019s average take-up was 89.1% of children across the 2023-2024 academic year.",
      "The research states: \u201cWe found the policy had greater benefits for families who were living in poverty or living on low incomes\u2026 but more affluent families were also strongly in favour of the policy, as they felt it acted as a leveller at school\u201d.",
      "It adds: \u201cSchool food costs are just one of many costs families face, including increased utilities and housing costs. Families have also noticed other school-related costs continuing to rise. This has diluted the financial effects of the policy for some families.\u201d",

    "published": "Wed, 20 Nov 2024 21:56:43 GMT",
    "summary": "In a dispute involving band NewJeans, the government said celebrities were not entitled to the same rights as workers.",
    "story": [
      "They have sold more albums than any other K-pop girl band last year, gained tens of millions of fans worldwide and are arguably one of South Korea's hottest acts.",
      "What the members of NewJeans are not, however, are workers, according to the government.",
      "The country's Ministry of Employment and Labor on Wednesday dismissed claims of workplace harrassment against a member of the group, saying celebrities were not seen as workers under the country's labour law - and were, therefore, not entitled to the same rights.",
      "The decision has drawn its fair share of scorn, with people saying they are not surprised given this is an industry known for its punishing schedules and intense competition.",
      "This is the latest scandal to hit NewJeans, which has for months been embroiled in a public feud with its record label, Ador.",
      "With slick pop songs like Super Shy, OMG and Supernatural, NewJeans were the eighth biggest-selling act in the world last year, and were nominated for best group at this year's MTV Awards.",
      "Formed by label Ador in 2022, the group has five members - Minji, Hanni, Danielle, Haerin and Hyein - whose ages range from 16 to 20.",
      "The incident started after 20-year-old Hanni and the other four members of the band raised concerns about their treatment by Ador during an impromptu YouTube livestream on 11 September.",
      "In the band's YouTube video, which has since been deleted, they made claims of workplace harassment, among others, which culminated in Hanni saying she would testify in a hearing about bullying in the music industry.",
      "The Vietnamese-Australian singer, whose real name is Pham Ngoc Han, told lawmakers that she felt \"the company hated us\".",
      "She described how senior members of Hybe ignored her and her bandmates, and gave them cold shoulder. She also alleged that employees of the agency bad-mouthed NewJeans on internal communication app and asked a journalist to downplay the group's record sales in one article.",
      "Hybe had previously denied the accusations. The CEO of Ador, which is a subsidiary of Hybe, said at the hearing that she would \"listen more closely\" to her artists.",
      "Her allegations prompted fans to file a petition about workplace bullying to the government.",
      "But on Wednesday, South Korea's labour ministry rejected these claims, saying given the content and nature of the management contract signed by Hanni, she is not regarded as a worker under the country's Labour Standards Act.",
      "\"Individuals must meet the criteria under the Labour Standards Act... to be considered workers. This includes having fixed working hours and providing labour under the employer\u2019s direct supervision and control. Celebrities, including singers, are typically classified as independent contractors,\" Chunghwan Choi, senior partner of Yulchon law firm in Seoul explained.",
      "The government also cites the nature of Hanni's income, which is deemed to be \"profit sharing, rather than wages\", according to local reports, adding that she pays business income tax rather than employment income tax.",
      "One expert has called the response \"utterly unfair and yet unsurprising\".",
      "The work for K-pop idols is \"emotionally and physically exhausting\", according to her, as they work \"incredibly long hours, often seven days a week for months in a row...[with] no clearly defined periods of rest\", says CedarBough Saeji, Assistant Professor of Korean and East Asian Studies at Pusan National University in South Korea.",
      "\"Exploitation of the workers is accepted because they are not regular employees and there is no labour union, or clearly we can now see, no governmental agency to advocate for humane working conditions for them,\" she argues.",
      "There are currently no specific laws in South Korea that provide protections for the working rights of celebrities or artists, says Mr Choi, saying that this \"underscores the urgent need for reforms to address longstanding issues in the entertainment industry\".",
      "One measure that could be put into place to safeguard the working rights of artists is something similar to the Talent Agency Act in Hollywood, which requires talent agencies to obtain licenses and prohibits unfair or exploitative contracts, adds Mr Choi.",
      "However, he adds that \"while there have been discussions about implementing laws similar to the Talent Agency Act, no such legislation has been enacted yet\".",
      "'Idols are Workers'",
      "On Wednesday, New Jeans fans rallied under the hashtag \"IdolsAreWorkers\" in support of the band.",
      "Others pointed out that the decision had a legal basis, as celebrities were not technically seen as workers under the law, but called for greater reforms in the industry.",
      "\"I get what they're saying about the role not qualifying for the legal defintion of workplace harrassment, but this just shows the need for reform in the K-pop industry\", said one user on X.",
      "Hanni has yet to comment on the government's decision.",
      "Hybe, which represents massive K-pop groups such as BTS and Seventeen, is South Korea's largest music firm.",

      "The movie\u2019s star Alec Baldwin was not invited and did not attend the premiere.",
      "Writer and director Joel Souza, who was wounded in the shooting, told the BBC at the premiere that at one point he \"couldn\u2019t even conceive of ever being back on the set ever again, it just hurt too much\".",
      "He said he changed his mind and decided to complete the film after speaking to Hutchins' husband, Matt.",
      "But the announcement that Camerimage in the northern Polish city of Torun was going to give the movie its international debut has been criticised by some prominent cinematographers in Hollywood for being disrespectful to Hutchins' memory.",
      "Hutchins\u2019 mother, Olga Solovey, who is suing the production and Alec Baldwin in a civil action, didn\u2019t attend either.",
      "In a statement issued by her lawyer she said she regards the premiere as an attempt to profit from her daughter\u2019s death.",
      "\u201cAlec Baldwin continues to increase my pain with his refusal to apologise to me and his refusal to take responsibility for her death,\u201d she said.",

      "Souza, who attended the premiere with Bianca Cline who replaced Hutchins as the film\u2019s cinematographer, refused several requests to complete the film after the tragic shooting, said Hutchins' husband, Matt, convinced him to complete the film, which is dedicated to her.",
      "\"At first I didn\u2019t really know if I wanted to do this to be honest, but as I found out that this is what Matt wanted, this is what the family wanted, it started to change the equation for me,\" he told the BBC.",
      "\"It was going to be more about honouring her legacy and her memory, saying that her final work was completed and that began to change my mind on things,\" he added.",
      "Both he and Cline acknowledged that many in the industry were uncomfortable with his decision.",

Some people think it\u2019s better to deal with that through not participating and other people think it\u2019s honourable like we do. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any right or wrong answer to this,\u201d Cline told the BBC.",
      "Before the screening, Rachel Mason, a close friend of Hutchins who filmed a documentary about the making of Rust, recalled how difficult it was to complete the movie with all the controversy surrounding it.",
      "She said some crew members told her not to film them on the closed set, in case, she said, it was discovered they had worked on Rust \"and I might never get a job again\".",
      "Crew came back to finish the filming after they realised it might help Hutchins' family.",
      "\"She had this amazing gift of becoming friends very, very fast with people. And they all fell in love with her,\" she said.",
      "Ms Mason also recounted a conversation with Hutchins' mother 18 months ago during which she told her she wanted the film to be completed because it was her daughter\u2019s \"big work\".",
      "Rust depicts the manhunt for grandfather and grandson amidst a backdrop of snow-capped mountains and tumbleweed dirt towns.",

      "Souza was very close to his own grandfather, who, he said, loved westerns.",

      "Logan Paul, the massively popular social media personality, is facing fresh questions over his cryptocurrency dealings amid ongoing concerns he may have profited from misleading fans.",
      "The BBC has seen new evidence suggesting he promoted investments without revealing he had a financial interest in them.",
      "The influence of Paul - whose YouTube channel has more than 23 million followers - appears to have caused prices in these investments to spike, leading to suggestions he could have profited from sales of any tokens he held.",
      "Paul also currently faces a multi-million-dollar lawsuit over a failed crypto project called CryptoZoo.",
      "He denies any wrongdoing.",
      "The BBC has discovered that shortly before Paul tweeted about a particular crypto coin in 2021, an anonymous crypto wallet with close connections to his public wallet had traded in the coin.",
      "That anonymous wallet went on to make a $120,000 (\u00a392,000) profit.",
      "Crypto wallets (which can be physical devices or an online service) hold users' keys to their accounts, and let people send, receive and spend crypto.",
      "Our finding comes after Time Magazine reported similar activity involving a different cryptocurrency and another anonymous wallet.",

      "Minutes after abandoning the interview, we received a lawyer\u2019s letter on behalf of Paul, warning us of the possible consequences if we published our findings.",
      "Meme coins",
      "Logan Paul built a worldwide following as an internet celebrity by uploading short video clips, first to the now-closed platform Vine, and then on YouTube.",
      "About three years ago, Paul\u2019s videos began mentioning cryptocurrency (crypto, as it is commonly known) more and more.",
      "Crypto is a form of digital money that uses secure technology to work, without the need for a central bank.",
      "In 2021, Paul promoted a series of extremely high-risk crypto tokens called \u201cmeme coins\u201d.",
      "These are usually inspired by internet jokes or memes and are supported by online communities. Meme coins have no other real purpose other than to be traded and, since they have no intrinsic worth, their value can - and often does - drop to zero.",
      "Paul extolled the virtues of an Elon Musk-themed meme coin known as Elongate. \u201cElongate made me rich. Elon baby let\u2019s go!\u201d Paul announced in a video clip to Maverick Club, his subscription-only fan club.",
      "Following this namecheck, the price of Elongate rose by over 6,000% to an all-time high. It then remained at that price for a few hours before it crashed.",

      "The anonymous crypto wallet analysed by the BBC appears to have close connections to Paul.",
      "Anyone can see the transactions made by a wallet, but the owner can choose to remain anonymous. If an owner attaches their name or personal details it becomes a public wallet.",

      "The wallet was later paid funds from Maverick Club and held Elongate when Paul promoted it on 10 May 2021.",
      "Shortly after, it also traded in another Musk-related meme coin - after Paul had tweeted that it was headed \u201cto the moon\u201d.  In the crypto community, this means someone believes the price of the coin is about to shoot up.",
      "About an hour before Paul\u2019s tweet, the unknown wallet purchased almost $160,000 (\u00a3123,000) worth of the token. The tweet prompted an influx of buyers, spiking the price.",
      "Twelve hours later, the wallet sold most of its holding. The total profit made from this trade appears to be just over $120,000 (\u00a392,000).",
      "Logan Paul chose not to respond to the BBC\u2019s allegations regarding the crypto wallet, the trading that occurred within it, or his connection to it, despite responding to some of our other requests via his legal team.",
      "Dink Doink",
      "In June 2021, Paul also promoted a meme coin called \u201cDink Doink\u201d.",
      "Anyone who bought it would own shares in a cartoon character that resembled a metal coil. They would earn a portion of its earnings if it appeared in a TV show or film.",
      "Paul promoted the token on Twitter (as the site was then known), and told a Telegram group dedicated to Dink Doink that he \u201cbelieved\u201d in it, saying: \u201cI think it\u2019s going to go crazy.\u201d",
      "Again, this led to a huge influx of buyers, causing Dink Doink's value to spike. Then - following a familiar pattern - large-scale holders of the token began selling, causing its price to fall by 96% in just two weeks.",
      "Time Magazine analysed another anonymous wallet that had bought Dink Doink prior to Logan Paul\u2019s promotion of the coin and then sold its holding shortly after. This wallet later sent $100,000 (\u00a378,000) to Paul\u2019s public wallet.",
      "When the BBC asked the influencer about this wallet, his lawyers did not deny that it belonged to him, or was held for his benefit, but were adamant that the $100,000 that was transferred was not related to Dink Doink.",
      "They do accept that Paul traded Dink Doink, but say he only made $17,000 (\u00a313,400).",
      "Puerto Rico",
      "For several months, Paul refused to be interviewed by the BBC.",
      "Then, unexpectedly, he agreed to talk to us at the boxing gym in Puerto Rico that he co-owns with his brother.",
      "We sent Paul a list of the allegations we wanted him to respond to, and his PR team requested we travel to the Caribbean island, so he could answer in person.",
      "They also insisted we flew into the island while it was being pummeled by Tropical Storm Ernesto, which had knocked out power to hundreds of thousands of people.",
      "At the gym, we noticed a strange atmosphere - with a suspicious number of his own cameras pointed at us. Paul\u2019s assistant insisted our cameras should be recording from the moment the star entered the room, because of his strict schedule and timekeeping.",
      "Then things became even stranger. Instead of Logan Paul, a lookalike arrived and sat down in front of our reporter, Matt Shea, and began impersonating the YouTuber.",
      "We called him out and began complaining to Paul\u2019s assistant, asking whether the real Logan Paul would be coming. At that moment, a group of people suddenly appeared, apparently from nowhere, wielding banners and shouting that the BBC were \u201cpaedophiles\u201d.",
      "We had flown all that way just to be trolled.",
      "In the past few years, a number of celebrities have run into legal trouble for promoting crypto to followers without disclosing that they had vested interests.",
      "Kim Kardashian was fined $1.26m (\u00a31m) in 2022 for promoting a token called EthereumMax on her Instagram account.",
      "According to Gary Gensler, the head of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the body policing the US investment industry, if a celebrity is promoting a particular crypto token, they are \u201csupposed to tell you if they get paid, how much they get paid, whether they own the tokens, whether they made money on the tokens, whether they actually know something about the project\u201d.",
      "CryptoZoo",
      "Logan Paul is now facing a lawsuit concerning his next venture in crypto - CryptoZoo.",
      "This was marketed as an online trading card game, but instead of cards, CryptoZoo was to use NFTs (non-fungible tokens) - collectible pieces of digital art that can have a value of their own.",
      "To play CryptoZoo, it was necessary to buy a cryptocurrency called Zoo Token, that could then be used to buy NFT \u201ceggs\u201d.",
      "These eggs were supposed to eventually hatch into NFT \u201canimals\u201d that would breed and give birth to NFT \u201chybrid animals\u201d with names like penguin-shark and panda-fin.",

      "\u201cAfter a certain point, you start to realise that something\u2019s wrong.\u201d",
      "The value of the Zoo Tokens and the eggs started to plummet. Rueben says he personally lost \u00a333,000.",
      "At least 130 investors are now involved in a lawsuit against Paul (Rueben is not one of them).  They claim they lost about $4.2m (\u00a33.25m).",
      "The lawyer behind the claim, Tom Kherkher - himself a popular YouTuber on legal affairs - says the failure to deliver the game forms only part of the case.",
      "He says leaked messages reveal Paul and his team were involved in a \u201cstealth launch\u201d of the Zoo Tokens, allowing them to quietly buy in at a low price.",
      "\u201cThe team appeared to agree that they can begin selling once the total value of all the Zoo Token in circulation hits $200m [\u00a3157m],\u201d he says.",
      "\u201cIf you had that document with that exact verbiage issued by a CEO of a publicly traded company, they would be charged with fraud in two seconds. That is insider trading.\u201d",
      "Paul has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing relating to CryptoZoo. Instead, he has laid the blame on other members of the team whom he also says failed to deliver the promised features.",
      "Earlier this year, Paul announced a partial compensation scheme for disappointed investors. He promised to refund people who had bought the NFT eggs, but only if they agreed not sue him for anything relating to CryptoZoo.",
      "Paul is also bringing a libel claim against one of his online detractors in the USA, for claims made about his motives.",
      "Logan Paul\u2019s immense popularity depends on his fans, and shows little sign of declining.",
      "In recent years, Paul has turned his hand to boxing and wrestling, as well as launching the drinks company Prime, with British influencer KSI.",
      "The product became notorious for its viral launch - with only a limited stocks made available, Prime spawned a re-sale market with bottles being advertised for hundreds of pounds. It was a testament to both Logan Paul and KSI\u2019s influence over their primarily young audience.",
      "However, for at least one fan, his image has been tarnished for good.",
      "\u201cOnce you listen to someone and trust what they\u2019re saying and they betray that trust,\u201d says Rueben Tauk, \u201ctheir words don\u2019t mean anything to you any more.\u201d",

      "Many have pinned its enduring success with audiences on the relatability of its content - from Elphaba's struggle with self-identity to Glinda's difficulty in making moral choices.",

    "published": "Tue, 19 Nov 2024 00:49:51 GMT",
    "summary": "The romcom king returns with a Christmas movie but this time it's an animation.",
    "story": [
      "As we hurtle towards Mariah Carey's most lucrative holiday, families all over the UK will be pressing play on Christmas films such as Love Actually to get themselves into the festive spirit.",
      "The 2003 movie was one of a string of hits from writer-director Richard Curtis which dominated the box office at the turn of the millennium, alongside Notting Hill, Bridget Jones's Diary and Four Weddings and a Funeral.",
      "Curtis is returning to the Christmas theme for his latest film, but this time around he has moved away from the traditional romcom and taken on his first animated project.",
      "\"The thing for me is, it's been a long time since I was, as it were, on the dating market,\" he tells BBC News. \"But I've been a dad for the last 25 years, so it was a real joy for me to be able to write about kids.\"",
      "The film-maker has described working on animation as \"a huge treat and revelation for me\", adding that the \"whole process is so different from the other movies I\u2019ve worked on\".",
      "That Christmas, released on Netflix on 4 December, is adapted from the book of short stories Curtis published in 2021.",
      "Set in the fictional coastal town of Wellington-on-Sea, the film follows a handful of families gearing up for Christmas Day. When a blizzard hits the town and leaves the parents separated from the children, their carefully planned celebrations are thrown into chaos.",
      "The theme of Christmas gone wrong was highly relatable to Swiss director Simon Otto, who has previously worked as an animator on How to Train Your Dragon and Enchanted.",
      "\"I know from my own family growing up, we had such a clear idea of the timeline of how Christmas or any tradition will unfold,\" he tells BBC News.",
      "\"And I can count more times where it didn't happen the way you expect and somehow something got messed up.",
      "\"We all have a Christmas memory where something goes wrong, those are the Christmases you remember the most, and at the end of that experience you always feel like, 'My god, we were able to be together for this time, and the realisation that that's what it's really all about.\"",
      "He adds: \"I thought there was a beautiful poetry in that which we really wanted to bring out in the film, and make it as familiar to people as we can, but also contemporary and real.\"",
      "The 90-minute film features the voices of Curtis regulars such as Bill Nighy, alongside Fiona Shaw, Jodie Whittaker, Lolly Adefope and Brian Cox as Santa Claus.",
      "That Christmas premiered at the London Film Festival in October, where it received broadly positive reviews from critics.",
      "\"It can be easy to sneer at the arrival of a new Christmas movie,\" noted the Hollywood Reporter's Lovia Gyarkye.",
      "\"Genuine holiday cheer is tough to conjure and, if you\u2019re not the intended audience for Hallmark-type saccharinity, the festive fare likely inspires more exasperation than joy.",
      "\"But this one slyly avoids the usual mawkishness by grounding its whimsical story in the real and prickly emotions of life.\"",
      "Next Best Picture's Philip Bagnall suggested the film is \"engineered to keep the kids busy around 4pm on Christmas Day while mum and dad sip their third Irish coffee in peace\".",
      "\"This is unlikely to become a festive classic,\" cautioned Screen Daily's Wendy Ide. \"But the message is a persuasive one: that Christmas comes in many shapes and forms and, ultimately, the only holiday tradition that is non-negotiable is goodwill to all.\"",
      "The film sees the children of the town left to fend for themselves, providing an opportunity to design the kind of Christmas Day they dreamed of, rather than the one planned by their parents which observed various family traditions.",
      "In one scene, the kids attempt to watch a Christmas film as their parents had suggested, but they get so bored they turn it off within moments. In a cheeky twist, the film they dismiss is Curtis's own Love Actually.",
      "Otto says he planted this joke in the movie without Curtis knowing. When the writer finally saw it, he jokes he found it \"very hurtful\".",
      "\"No, not really,\" he laughs. \"It reminded me of course that, when you say 'boring old Christmas movie', I think of Miracle on 34th Street or whatever, but when you say it to a young person, they say Love Actually. It was 20 years ago!\"",
      "One of the film's central questions is whether families should stick to traditions or be open to new experiences.",
      "\"The truth is that it shouldn't be all traditions nor a complete reinvention,\" Otto reflects, \"because some traditions are there for a reason, and we love them. We talk about Santa to our kids for a reason, because there's something magical.\"",
      "One striking thing about the film is how contemporary and diverse it feels. Curtis's earlier films were made in a different era, and he has said in recent years his approach to casting would be different today.",
      "But That Christmas does its best to make up for lost ground. As Ide noted in her review, the film \"unfolds in a fictional Suffolk seaside town... but the wide mix of accents and ethnicities suggests that the filmmakers have tried to cram the whole of Great Britain into this single tiny village\".",
      "It's not only the mixed-race family at the centre of the film which make it feel of the times. The children in the movie are concerned about climate change, and one has chronic anxiety.",
      "There are lighter modern flourishes too - the father in one family christens his van Beyonc\u00e9, smartphones play a big part in the plot, and the soundtrack features Dua Lipa and Ed Sheeran.",
      "Curtis acknowledges the conscious effort to make the film feel current. \"I started my career on a show called Not The Nine O'Clock News,\" he recalls, \"which was contemporary sketches, and I think always in my films I've tried to write jokes that make me laugh now, rather than traditional jokes.",
      "\"And the thing about being a parent is you spend most of your life in the real world of your kids, so I love the fact that it does feel modern, because life as it comes at you these days just is modern.\"",
      "Otto picks up: \"It felt true to me. If you take a snapshot of who lives [in the UK], it varies from region to region of course, but it's such a diverse, interesting, eclectic mix of people.",
      "\"It feels to me like that's the world we live in, and certainly we didn't want to create a world we lived in 10 years ago. If anything, we wanted to create a world we might live in 10 years from now, so more forward looking.\"",
      "The film is being released in a healthy year for animation, with The Wild Robot, Inside Out 2 and Flow among those competing in this year's awards race.",
      "But there is still a certain snobbery towards animated films, and only three have ever scored a best picture nomination - Beauty and the Beast, Toy Story 3 and Up.",
      "Director Guillermo del Toro has previously championed it as its own craft, commenting: \"Animation is not a genre for kids. It's a medium for art.\"",
      "Curtis agrees: \"I feel quite strongly about that at this moment, because for me, the two Spider-Verse movies are the most remarkable movies of the last 10 years.",
      "\"I watch them and I think, 'they must have taken 300 years to make, they're so extraordinary'. In the same way it's turned out that much pop music, which used to be looked down on, is really great, I think every genre can be great, and there are some amazing works of art in the world of animation.\"",

    "story": [
      "After scoring their latest number one with an album named after an eight-foot fibreglass gorilla called Gary, Manchester band Blossoms are doing a victory lap of their home city - with five sold-out gigs in five different venues in five nights.",
      "Musical inspiration can strike any time and anywhere.",
      "Few rock frontmen, though, would have been open to receiving it while in a car listening to a news report about the theft of a giant model gorilla from a Scottish garden centre.",
      "Tom Ogden wrote an indie-pop anthem about the incident, then dedicated their fifth album to the unfortunate inanimate ape.",
      "\"I'm under the impression that anything can be a song, if you approach it in the right manner,\" Ogden reasons.",
      "\"And 10 years in, you're always looking for new things to write about.",
      "\"I found the story entertaining when I heard it on the radio, so just as a laugh I went away [and said] I'm going to write a song about it.",
      "\"I mean, if the song wasn't very good, it would have never seen the light of day. But I rated the song.\"",
      "To Blossoms, Gary has now become muse and mascot, spirit animal and unofficial sixth member of the band.",
      "Both the song and the replica of Gary that the group have taken on tour are fan favourites.",
      "Some would also call it a gimmick, which is partly true, except that not even Ogden could seriously have calculated that the song and the story behind it would really catch on.",
      "\"It has connected with people,\" the singer says. \"I didn't anticipate it, but I knew I wanted to have something that made people go, what's that?",
      "\"Even if people think it is ludicrous, it's an entry point. And people were just ready for a bit of fun, I suppose.",
      "\"You can sense there's something in there which has connected with people for all ages. There are kids who love Gary, and then you've got our age, and then you've got older people.",

      "Watch Blossoms perform on the BBC's Later... with Jools Holland",
      "A decade into their careers, and with four number one albums, Blossoms are serious enough to have the confidence to be ludicrous.",
      "They have also thrown off the indie shackles on a special edition of Gary featuring cover versions of songs by acts ranging from Bob Marley to Lady Gaga and Whitney Houston.",
      "\"We love doing a cover, and we thought we'd cover songs we loved growing up. I always loved I Wanna Dance With Somebody. It's as simple as that,\" Ogden says.",
      "And in recent years, they have joined forces with 1980s star Rick Astley to tour as a The Smiths tribute band.",
      "Blossoms' love of 80s pop was noted in a review in The Times of the Gary album, which declared the track I Like Your Look was \"Wham!-like\".",
      "\"I took that as a huge compliment, because I love Wham!\" Ogden says.",
      "Thick skin",
      "However, the same critic also dismissively described Gary as an \"ultra-shallow album\".",
      "\"I think if you call an album Gary, and you write a song about a fibreglass gorilla, you're out in the open, in terms of someone's going to say something like that,\" the singer responds.",
      "\"But I think there is depth on the album, of course, because there are songs like Mothers, which is about friendship and growing up. And then Why Do I Give You The Worst Of Me? is a very personal song.",
      "\"So I think someone's just thought, yeah, there's a song about fibreglass gorilla, maybe that's a bit of fun. And I Like Your Look\u2019s not taking itself too seriously either.",
      "\"And do you know what, you can\u2019t please everybody so... I don't really care, to be honest.",
      "\"You've got to learn to grow thick skin in this [business]. But I understand if they're saying it because we called the album Gary.",
      "\"Like, fair enough, whatever, man.\"",

      "Massive outdoor shows don't always live up to expectations.",
      "In 2019, the band took over Edgeley Park, the home of Stockport County FC, in the Greater Manchester town where they grew up.",
      "\"We only had two albums, and maybe it felt like we weren't as good live, basically, as we are now,\" Ogden reflects.",
      "\"We feel like we\u2019re at the peak of our powers this year.\"",
      "Wythenshawe Park was the \"best gig we've ever done\", he says.",
      "\"We put everything into that show, and in no way did it feel disappointing. It blew us away even more than we expected.\"",
      "After that, when the band came to plan a full UK tour, they weren't sure whether to play in Manchester again.",
      "However, they decided they would - not once but five times, all at different venues of different sizes, and all of which they have played at before at different stages of their careers.",
      "Their mini one-city tour starts at Manchester Academy on Tuesday before visiting the Ritz, Albert Hall, Victoria Warehouse and Apollo.",

      "They are all places that hold fond memories for the band.",
      "\"The Ritz was the first big headline show we did in, when we felt like, oh, something's definitely happening here. We sold that out before we had a record deal and was the first time fans were singing and moshing around.",
      "\"I remember going to watch bands at the Academy - I remember watching Jake Bugg there, and I watched Miles Kane there when I was 15 or 16, so I always have a soft spot for that place.",

    "title": "Silent Men film asks why so many still struggle to open up",
    "published": "Mon, 18 Nov 2024 17:59:12 GMT",
    "summary": "Scottish filmmaker Duncan Cowles set out to ask why men tend to bottle up their emotions.",
    "story": [
      "Male mental health is back in the spotlight ahead of International Men's Day on Tuesday (19 November). The subject has received much more prominence in the last decade - something many would argue is long overdue.",
      "But while the high rates of male suicide have put the topic firmly on the national agenda - huge numbers of men still find it difficult to be openly vulnerable and discuss their feelings.",
      "With suicide the biggest killer of men under 50 in the UK, a new film explores why many men still bottle up their emotions, and asks whether such ingrained, systemic behaviour can be changed.",
      "Duncan Cowles, who directs Silent Men, is the first to admit his own struggles to open up emotionally to those closest to him, joking that tackling the subject for the documentary was \"like dragging myself backwards through a hedge\".",
      "Speaking at the Sheffield Documentary Festival earlier this year, he told BBC News it was an important journey to go on because the risks of ignoring your emotions are far scarier.",
      "\"I think there's still a lot of societal pressure around those traditional masculine traits,\" Cowles says. \"Being strong and things associated with being a leader or this stable, reliable, dependable figure.",
      "\"There's maybe something still seductive about that idea of that old-fashioned man, that James Bond character that a lot of us maybe grew up with. I think it's still quite sought-after by a lot of people.",
      "\"Whereas my experience is when you're a bit more open and vulnerable, that can actually lead to stronger relationships, and therefore more joy, connection and fulfilment. And yet still we're drawn to being closed off.\"",
      "If you are affected by any of the issues in this story, the BBC Action Line has information about services that can provide support and advice.",
      "If you are affected by any of the issues in this story, the BBC Action Line has information about services that can provide support and advice.",
      "The idea of men suffering in silence is nothing new. It was 1854 when Henry David Thoreau wrote: \"Most men lead lives of quiet desperation.\"",
      "The fact that the essayist's most famous observation has survived for 170 years and is still quoted so widely today is a testament to its relatability - but also of how little progress has been made.",
      "Thoreau tapped into a feeling many men have, both then and now, of being unfulfilled - whether that's in their career, relationships or for reasons they can't quite put their finger on.",
      "Overwhelmed by the commitments or mundanity of day-to-day life, while simultaneously unwilling or unable to voice their emotions, men often find it hard to cope.",
      "Blue blanket theory",
      "\"I suppose it's always been something I've struggled with, opening up and showing emotions around family,\" Cowles says of his reasons for making the film.",
      "\"While I was at university, I'd done a little film which investigated that, but it always felt like this thing that I hadn't fully resolved in my life.\"",
      "Setting out to explore the subject further at the start of the film, Cowles posts an advert online, looking for men to speak to for the documentary. He then goes to interview some of those who reply.",
      "He travels around the country and speaks to men from different walks of life over several years. At one point, he attends a retreat where men gather for a weekend to do group therapy.",
      "\"I wanted to go on my own journey, parallel to speaking to men as part of the film. But it turned into a more personal film than I expected,\" he explains.",
      "The Scottish filmmaker interviews members of his own family and studies how their personalities shaped his own. \"My dad likes drilling holes in the wall, and his stamps, but he's not big on verbal communication,\" Cowles notes early on - painting a picture of fathers many will recognise.",
      "One trauma specialist interviewed for the film cites a study which found that babies in blue blankets - and therefore assumed to be boys - were touched for significantly less time than girls.",
      "\"So that's really interesting, what are we doing in our culture about socialising boys to not be touched as much, not be seen as vulnerable, not need emotional support as much as girls?\" she asks.",
      "\"The toughening up - 'be a brave boy, big boys don't cry' - that process of making you into a man, where someone has told you that that's what a man is, that a man has got to be emotionally strong.",
      "\"There are all these social constructs that kind of trap you, which is causing huge numbers of mental health issues for guys. We've got a big problem on our hands.\"",
      "Silent Men is Cowles' first feature documentary, but he previously won a Bafta Scotland award for his short film Isabella.",
      "Asked if it was difficult to get the men featured in the film to talk about their feelings, Cowles replies: \"Strangely not, because there's something about speaking to a stranger that can sometimes feel a lot easier than speaking to someone who's in your own family. I guess it's because you've less to lose.\"",
      "The insights from other men make for interesting viewing. One contributor, Ainslie, says his outlook changed after having a baby. But not necessarily in the way you might think - he says the responsibility of being a father actually meant there was less time and opportunity to find room for expressing his own emotions.",
      "Another man, Dom, tells his young son constantly how much he loves him, and says he hated the thought of anybody close to him dying without knowing how much they meant to him.",
      "One of the film's most affecting - and funniest - moments comes when the microphone Cowles' brother is using cuts out after the battery dies, and he uses that exact moment, when he can't fully be heard, to tell Duncan: \"I love you.\"",
      "Despite all the heavy talk, the film is peppered with moments of levity - the director occasionally cuts away abruptly from tough conversations to run footage of soothing shorelines and bumble bees on flowers.",
      "\"One thing I really wanted to do with this film is make it feel accessible, not all mental health based, but [to] also contain humour and leave people with a smile on their face,\" he says.",
      "The documentary builds towards a conclusion as Cowles sits down with his parents to tell them he loves them.",
      "While both are receptive, his father is somewhat dismissive of the \"airy-fairy\" nature of showing emotions, suggesting it's \"not a normal thing for a man\".",
      "Therefore, his father argues, if somebody isn't opening up, that's actually a good sign, as not feeling the need to be vulnerable means they are generally feeling content.",
      "Reflecting on his father's comments now, Cowles says: \"He comes from a generation where he doesn't want to see someone visibly upset, so if you're showing nothing, then that's a good thing [to him] because it means you're OK. I know what he means.",
      "\"Younger people seem to have a different opinion on these kinds of things, and they are more willing to open up,\" he notes. \"There's that awareness of the issue.\"",
      "Cowles admits on camera his worry that he will pretend to have made progress for the purposes of giving the film a happy ending, when in reality there may not have been any significant change.",
      "But several months after filming wrapped, Cowles says making the film \"definitely has\" altered his behaviour.",
      "\"I wouldn't say it's a Hollywood transformation,\" he laughs. \"It's been quite a gradual thing, and I wouldn't say I'm perfect by any means.",
      "\"But compared to what I was like before, my partner is very appreciative that I've changed, that I'm more conscious of it and able to recognise when I should open up a bit more.\"",
      "Silent Men is screened at Sheffield DocFest in June and is released in UK cinemas on 19 November."

      "With eternal bragging rights, five minutes of fame and (paltry) cash prizes up for grabs, the winners and organisers explain why these events have taken off.",
      "'It was a free event, why wouldn't I go?'",
      "Our fascination with celebrity lookalikes is nothing particularly new - Stars in Their Eyes, a show in which amateur lookalikes impersonate singers, ran on ITV for 16 years. The format was revived as Starstruck in 2022.",
      "But the latest competitions all have one thing in common: the celebrities are all young, attractive and male.",
      "Avani Johnson, who was at the Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet contest, says she believes the latest trend has taken off because \"women are relishing the opportunity to objectify men in a complete switch in power dynamics\".",
      "She adds that it also gives us a chance \"to laugh at the absurdity of pageantry\".",
      "Miles Mitchell, a 20-year-old student, picked up the prize for the best Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet lookalike last month at the competition that set this trend alight.",

      "\"It was also just something a bit different and wacky that I wanted to be part of.\"",
      "The event took social media by storm, with one person commenting on X it was \"a historic pop culture moment\", while another said the competition \"shows that the people yearn for weird town events\".",

      "Even though most of the contestants didn't quite look like Harry, \"the girls were screaming for each man as they got up to twirl, so they were doing something right\".",
      "\"Really it wasn't about who looked most like Harry,\" Katrina explains. \"It was a way for people to just be positive and celebratory about each other, which is what we need when everyone is so nasty and negative on social media.\"",
      "She has now got her eye on hosting another competition but this time \"for someone older, like Hugh Grant\".",
      "'I made new friends at the contest'",
      "Jaipreet Hundal had a pretty good weekend when he was crowned the most convincing Dev Patel lookalike in San Francisco.",
      "\"The best bit was that when I turned up, some people thought I was the real Dev Patel and they were so excited that he had come to the event,\" he tells the BBC.",
      "The 25-year-old says looking like the Slumdog Millionaire actor has \"given him a glimpse of what it's like to be a celebrity\".",
      "He explains that the trend is popular now because \"it's a great way to get people together to have a wholesome time\".",
      "Sudev Namboodiri, who drove hours to enter the competition and gets told he looks like Dev on an almost daily basis, says it \"wasn't about winning\".",
      "\"It's nice to meet new people and it was cool that hundreds of young people decided to turn up and hang out.\"",

      "Julyus, from Venezuela, says his friends think he looks so much like Zayn that \"people don't even call me by my real name any more\".",

    "published": "Wed, 20 Nov 2024 16:00:29 GMT",
    "summary": "Scientists are mapping out the 37 trillion cells of the human body and changing what we thought we knew",
    "story": [
      "An ambitious plan to map all 37 trillion cells in the human body is transforming understanding of how our bodies work, scientists report.",
      "The received wisdom said we were built from around 200 types of cell \u2013 such as heart muscle or nerve cells.",
      "Instead the Human Cell Atlas project has revealed there are thousands of cell types, with some appearing to be culprits in diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease and cystic fibrosis.",
      "In a flurry of announcements, the formation of the human skeleton and the early immune system have also been mapped out in detail.",
      "The novel insight is akin to moving from the maps of the 15th Century era of Joan of Arc and Richard III to what the phone in your pocket can load.",
      "The old maps of the body had the equivalent of major roads and significant geography but also areas cartographers labelled unknown or \u201cterra incognita\u201d.",
      "\u201c[Now] it looks more like a Google map, you have a high resolution view and then on top of that you have the Street View that explains what\u2019s going on, and then on top of that you can see the dynamic changes during the day when less cars are flowing or more cars are flowing,\u201d said Dr Aviv Regev, one of the founders who now works at now at Genentech.",
      "She added: \u201cThis is essential for us to understand and treat disease, cells are the basic unit of life, if things go wrong, they go wrong with our cells.\u201d",
      "Performing a feat of \u201chuman cartography\u201d requires cutting-edge biology and computer science.",
      "The project so far has looked at more than 100 million cells \u2013 deeply analysing each individual one - from 10,000 people around the world.",
      "The journal Nature has now published a series of 40 scientific discoveries as researchers work towards creating the first draft of the whole human cell atlas.",
      "\u201cThis is a major milestone that marks a great leap in understanding of the human body,\u201d said Dr Sarah Teichmann, from the University of Cambridge and one of the founders of the Human Cell Atlas.",
      "The latest discoveries include a map of the gut all the way from the mouth, down the oesphagus, into the stomach and intestines and out the anus.",
      "Researchers looked at the types of cells, where they were located and how they chatted to the other cells around them.",
      "Out of the 1.6 million cells analysed was a new form, called a gut metaplastic cell. It seems to play a role in exacerbating inflammation in the seven million people that live with inflammatory bowel diseases such as ulcerative colitis and Crohn\u2019s disease.",
      "\u201cWe were able to uncover a pathogenic cell type that may play a role in some chronic conditions and could be a target for [drug] intervention in the future,\u201d said Dr Rasa Elmentaite, who did the research at the Wellcome Sanger Institute.",
      "There are more than 3,600 scientists across 100 countries collaborating on the Human Cell Atlas, which is one of the most ambitious projects in biology and has been described as the heir to the Human Genome Project to sequence the human genetic code.",
      "Another discovery showed how the human skeleton forms in the womb in the weeks after conception.",
      "First a scaffold of cartilage, like the wobbly bit on the end of your nose, forms. Then bone cells grow over it. This happens everywhere except for the very top of the skull to give the brain space to grow.",
      "Some of the genetic instructions involved in orchestrating this early developmental process are the same ones implicated in osteoarthritis decades later.",
      "\u201cUltimately, using this atlas could help us better understand the conditions of both the young and ageing skeleton,\u201d said Dr Ken To, from the Wellcome Sanger Institute.",
      "A similar study looked at the thymus \u2013 a small organ involved in training the immune system. Researchers showed this process started much earlier than previously thought suggesting the earliest stages of pregnancy could have an impact on immune function for life.",
      "It also gives ideas for engineering new immune-cell-based therapies in the laboratory for fighting diseases such as a cancer.",
      "Another example of the Human Cell Atlas in action came during the Covid pandemic when the detailed maps of the body allowed scientists to anticipate how the virus would move from tissue to tissue and identified the nose, mouth and eyes as key entry points to the body.",
      "Dr Katrina Gold, from the Wellcome Trust medical research funder, said today\u2019s announcements were a \u201ctrue milestone for the Human Cell Atlas\u201d.",
      "\u201cWhen complete, it could transform the ways we diagnose, monitor and treat diseases,\u201d she said."

    "story": [
      "Hundreds of women in the UK are planning to take on one of the world's biggest pharmaceutical companies over alleged links between talc and cancer.",
      "Diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 2021, Cassandra Wardle is one of the women launching a group action against the biggest seller of talcum powder, Johnson & Johnson (J&J).",
      "Cassandra, who stumbled on a Facebook article linking cancer and talc following her diagnosis, said it was used on her as a baby and she continued to use it \"for 20 years or more\".",
      "\"You mimic your mum who used it,\" she said. \"Baby powder was supposed to be something deemed 'safe to use', even on a baby's bum.\"",
      "If it proceeds, the legal action would be the first of its kind brought against the pharmaceutical multinational in the UK.",
      "With 1,900 potential claimants, including cancer patients, survivors and families, lawyers say it is set to be the largest pharmaceutical product group action in English and Welsh legal history.",
      "The BBC has spoken to a number of women with gynaecological cancers - many are part of the group action - who believe their repeated use of talcum powder played a part in their diagnosis.",
      "Their lawyers allege that for decades, talcum powder was contaminated with cancer-causing asbestos - something they claim J&J was aware of but sought to suppress.",
      "J&J denies suppressing any information and denies any links between its baby powder, asbestos and cancer.",
      "\"The doctors said the cancer was unusual for my age at 44,\" says Cassandra, from Alfreton in Derbyshire.",
      "She says she would regularly use talcum powder after a bath or as a deodoriser, including across her genitals.",
      "\"I was just starting my chemo journey when I read about the links, but I felt enraged that a corporate giant like J&J could seem to do this,\" she says.",
      "At first, doctors believed Cassandra's cancer was terminal.",
      "\"I went to the consultation alone,\" she says. \"So I had to come home and tell my husband what they said, tell my parents they would be burying me.",
      "\"I closed down my business unit and laid off staff.",
      "\"I even created a not-so-creative acronym: 'LAC - Life After Cass'.\"",
      "Then, she had an unexpected lifeline. Chemotherapy had in fact triggered an autoimmune condition, giving the impression of late-stage cancer.",
      "Cassandra survived. But the disease still had a devastating effect on her life.",
      "She was forced to give up her business, and an infection during chemotherapy damaged her vocal cords, reducing her voice to a whisper. A hysterectomy to remove cancerous tissue had a huge impact on her body.",
      "\"I was plunged into surgical menopause,\" she says.",
      "\"I would have liked children. I was never blessed that way, but my last ability to have children was taken away due to cancer.\"",
      "Are there links between talcum powder and cancer?",
      "The claims of links between talcum powder and cancer revolve around asbestos - a known carcinogen.",
      "Talc is a mineral that is sometimes used in talcum powders and other cosmetic products, according to Cancer Research UK.",
      "Sophia Lowes, from the charity, said: \"[Talc] can be mined in places where there is asbestos, which can cause the talc to become contaminated. Asbestos is known to cause mesothelioma and cancers of the lung, larynx and ovary.",
      "\"The sale of products containing asbestos is banned in the UK and cosmetic products need to be safety-tested before they can be sold.\"",
      "Many documents were hidden from public view until Americans with cancer began suing the firm.",
      "J&J has been accused of knowing decades ago that its baby powder could contain contaminants of asbestos.",
      "J&J has previously said that \"any suggestion that Johnson & Johnson knew or hid information about the safety of talc is false\".",
      "The company discontinued mineral-based talc in North America in 2020 - and followed suit in the UK last year - replacing it with cornstarch. J&J said this was due to financial pressures and a \"misinformation campaign\" around the product.",
      "While the focus of the group action is on the contamination of talc with asbestos, in July this year the World Health Organization (WHO) concluded that mineral talc itself was \"probably carcinogenic for humans\".",
      "Deborah, who did not want to be identified by her real name, also lives in Derbyshire, and was diagnosed with ovarian cancer at 29, just two weeks after she and her husband had started trying for a baby.",
      "\"I used talcum powder for years as a teenager,\" she says.",
      "\"Literally all I had was some stabbing pain on a Sunday night. I went to the doctor and was sent for an ultrasound on the Tuesday.\"",
      "During the scan, a tumour was found on Deborah's ovary. A few days later she had an operation, at which point doctors told her there was a risk the cancer had spread to her womb.",
      "\"Within two weeks of the first symptoms, I'd had a full hysterectomy,\" she says.",
      "\"I went from excitedly planning for a baby to having all of my parts removed.\"",
      "Deborah's diagnosis was 30 years ago, and she and her husband ultimately went on to adopt.",
      "But she still feels angry that she was robbed of the chance to conceive naturally.",
      "\"If [J&J] knew, they shouldn't have been doing it,\" she says.",
      "KP Law, representing the claimants, has begun the process of litigation, which is expected to start at the beginning of 2025.",
      "In the US, the firm has been sued by more than 62,000 people and at least $13bn has been paid out or set aside in response to the action.",
      "Cases there have seen the company found liable for mesothelioma - an asbestos-specific cancer - and gynaecological cancers women suffered after using talc, with billions of dollars awarded in damages.",
      "'Entirely transparent'",
      "Tom Longstaff, a partner at KP Law, says: \"The case has been litigated repeatedly in the American judicial system but women in the UK deserve an answer, and compensation, here.",
      "\"Asbestos cancers tend to have a latency of around 10 to 40 years. So we are walking into a wave of women reaching an age where asbestos cancers develop.\"",
      "Mr Longstaff's firm sent a pre-action letter to J&J in September, a necessary step before starting proceedings. If the case goes ahead, it would likely end up in court next year.",
      "In response, Erik Haas - worldwide vice-president of litigation for Johnson & Johnson, said the allegations against the company \"defy logic, rewrite history and ignore the facts\".",
      "\"J&J takes the issue of talc safety incredibly seriously and always has,\" he says.",
      "\"As our documents show, we have relied upon the most state-of-the-art testing protocols for decades and have been entirely transparent with government institutions and academic researchers regarding our findings.\"",
      "Mr Haas also said the idea that J&J hid the contaminated contents of its products from the public, government and other groups was \"inconceivable and false\".",
      "Litigation like this can take four or five years. Some of the women we spoke to fear they won't see it concluded.",
      "Linda Jones has stage four cancer.",
      "\"I don't have that long left. I might be dead by the time it's sorted out,\" the 66-year-old, from Devon, says.",
      "\"I loved [talcum powder]. After a bath at night, it was a great big warm hug putting on Johnson's baby powder.",
      "\"As soon as my children were born, I used it on them.\"",
      "If she does get a settlement, she wants to help other women going through similar situations. She hopes to set up a holiday retreat for women diagnosed with gynaecological cancers.",
      "\"I just want to see them compensating everyone without a fight. We already had a fight in the States,\" she says.",
      "A J&J spokesperson said: \"As the history of the US talc litigation shows, the majority of cases tried resulted in defence verdicts or were overturned in favour of the defence on appeal.",
      "\"The UK judicial system is vastly different than in the US, and we believe that if a UK court has an opportunity to review the scientific literature and company documents in proper context, it too will conclude that Johnson's baby powder is safe, does not contain asbestos, and does not cause cancer.\"",

      "Although his family left Wales when he was four, he remained proud of his heritage and always considered himself Welsh.",
      "He became a trainee chef on leaving school at 15 and then worked for eight years as a ship's steward on passenger liners, becoming active in the National Union of Seamen.",

      "Cherished principles",
      "John Prescott became a Labour frontbench spokesman in May 1979 and joined the shadow cabinet in 1983, gaining a reputation as a pugnacious and knowledgeable spokesman on transport.",
      "The same year his showman's instincts saw him swim two miles down the River Thames to highlight opposition to Margaret Thatcher's government policy of dumping nuclear waste at sea.",
      "But it was the Labour leader John Smith who finally gave John Prescott political room to breathe, with a key role in selling modernisation to the party and unions.",
      "It was John Smith who kick-started Labour's slow return to power, overturning many of the party's most cherished principles in a drive to make it electable again.",
      "And John Prescott, with his strong union links and no-nonsense approach, offered vital support, not least in the abolition of the union block vote that had been Labour policy for years.",
      "When Tony Blair became leader, following John Smith's untimely death in 1994, he too recognised the importance of keeping John Prescott on board.",
      "The Hull East MP became deputy leader and later deputy prime minister with wide departmental responsibility over transport and the environment.",
      "He pledged to create an integrated transport system and said his success would be measured by a reduction in people needing to use a car.",
      "This caused him considerable embarrassment when, at the 1999 Labour conference, he used his ministerial car - a Jaguar - for a 200-yard journey back to his hotel.",
      "In typical Prescott style, he claimed it was so his wife Pauline's hair would not get blown about.",
      "But the politician, who also owned a Jaguar himself, was soon dubbed \"two Jags\" in the press.",
      "He once described himself as the guard on the Labour train - ready to slow it down if it moved off the rails. Yet his solid working-class credentials added powerful support to Tony Blair and the Labour modernisers.",
      "He campaigned passionately against the Conservative policy of privatising Britain's railways and was reported to have been furious when Labour failed to adopt a policy of renationalisation when returned to power.",
      "Election punch",
      "His policy of creating elected regional assemblies to oversee the new regional development agencies also hit the buffers, when, in a referendum in a pilot area in England's North East, 78% of people rejected the idea.",
      "He also faced opposition over his so-called Pathfinder project, designed to provide thousands of new homes.",
      "As part of the policy, about 200,000 homes in the North of England were demolished, which, critics said, could have been renovated at much less cost.",
      "His passion and burly style of delivery were constant features.",
      "He repeatedly described New Labour's mission as delivering \"traditional values in a modern setting\" - a powerful if somewhat intangible concept.",
      "Mocked by some for mangling his syntax, he often still managed to inject humour into difficult situations - such as when he was criticised for accusing a female French minister of being too tired to understand the intricacies of an environment summit.",
      "\"As to whether I am accused of being a macho man - moi?\" he told the Commons. \"I must say the remark leaves me most gutted.\"",
      "He hit the headlines during the 2001 general election after he was filmed throwing a punch at a member of the public who had thrown an egg at him during a protest in Rhyl, Flintshire.",
      "John Prescott said he had acted in self-defence and police refused to take any further action. Subsequent newspaper polls suggested most people supported his reaction.",
      "Oyster bar",
      "In later days, John Prescott reportedly had to act as a peacemaker between Tony Blair and the Chancellor, Gordon Brown, as speculation about the succession to the leadership ebbed and flowed.",
      "His own comment in a newspaper, that the \"tectonic plates\" in the Labour Party were moving, gave rise to suggestions of manoeuvring within the cabinet.",
      "And when he was seen sharing a car with Gordon Brown and stopping off at a Scottish oyster bar, the rumours that Tony Blair was about to stand down intensified.",
      "However, as his career as an MP neared its end, the headlines surrounding John Prescott concentrated on his private life.",
      "In 2006, he admitted to an affair with his former secretary Tracey Temple, which led to a raft of lurid stories.",
      "In a cabinet reshuffle soon after the revelations emerged, John Prescott was stripped of his department, although kept on as deputy prime minister and allowed to retain his salary and grace-and-favour homes.",
      "But, in a further embarrassment, he felt compelled to give up his country pile, Dorneywood, after being pictured on its lawns playing croquet with his staff - an image at odds with his down-to-earth reputation.",
      "It was later revealed he had visited the US ranch of businessman Philip Anschutz - whose company took over the running of the Millennium Dome and who was bidding to build Britain's first super-casino.",
      "Critics said there was a conflict of interest. John Prescott, who met Mr Anschutz seven times, failed to declare the visit for 11 months. He eventually said he had gone because he liked cowboy films.",
      "The Commons Standards and Privileges Committee ruled the ministerial code had been broken because the trip had not been declared immediately.",
      "Lording it",
      "Shortly after Tony Blair said he would be stepping down as prime minister, John Prescott announced he would relinquish his role as deputy.",
      "He ended his time in government with no ministerial brief of his own and was seen by many as a peripheral figure.",
      "To the surprise of many of his supporters, he accepted a peerage in 2010 despite reportedly having once said: \"I don't want to be a member of the House of Lords. I will not accept it.\"",
      "He defended the decision because it would give him continued influence over environmental policy and he refused to treat the red benches as an upmarket retirement home, using them as a platform to carry on campaigning.",
      "He continued to serve in the Lords until July of this year, when he was removed for non-attendance - bringing down the curtain on a parliamentary career of more than 50 years.",
      "His most robust interventions in Lords debates involved attacking the government's response to the phone-hacking scandal.",
      "For Lord Prescott, the matter was personal - his lawyers alleged the News of the World had placed him under surveillance, and in 2012 he won a pay out from the paper's parent company, News International.",
      "He was back on the stump again in 2012 when he stood as a candidate in Humberside in the elections for the new office of police and crime commissioner.",
      "He was said to be disappointed when he lost out to a Conservative opponent on the second round of balloting.",
      "Party loyalist",
      "John Prescott remained a Labour loyalist at heart.",
      "While ultimately distancing himself from Tony Blair's decision to go to war in Iraq, he defended his former boss' legacy and was equally supportive of the different leaders that followed him.",
      "He also advised the then-Labour leader Ed Miliband in the run up to the 2015 election.",
      "He was far from a natural bedfellow of Jeremy Corbyn but insisted the left-wing campaigner - who opposed nearly all of what New Labour stood for - had \"proved himself\", and urged dissident MPs to support him.",
      "His son David - who himself stood unsuccessfully for Parliament - was even part of Jeremy Corbyn's team.",
      "And speaking at Labour's 2017 conference - the 51st he had attended - he said the party was on the path back to government and had a \"really exciting\" future.",
      "In 2019, he suffered a stroke and was taken to Hull Royal Infirmary. But his former Labour colleague, Alan Johnson, said there were \"no signs of him slowing down at all\".",
      "To the very end, he represented a breed apart from many of his contemporaries - a Labour MP who had cut his campaigning teeth in a trades union rather than as a political adviser and who believed political principles had to be married to power.",

      "It comes as an increasing number of firms warn that the tax rises and the higher minimum wage announced in the Budget could lead them to increase prices for customers.",

      "Four of the nine-strong Monetary Policy committee on Tuesday said it was was not clear whether prices rises will accelerate or slow in the coming months. Much depends, as numerous members of the Bank of England have suggested, on the pass through of Budget measures into prices and wages.",

    "summary": "Peter Kyle says the decision to restrict payments this winter was made with a \"heavy heart\".",
    "story": [
      "A cabinet minister has said restricting winter fuel payments does not \"sit easily\" with him, after estimates it would increase poverty among pensioners.",
      "Technology Secretary Peter Kyle said the decision to restrict the \u00a3300 payment to all but the poorest pensioners this winter was made with a \"heavy heart\".",
      "But he insisted the \"difficult\" decision was required to repair the public finances.",
      "It comes after the government disclosed an official estimate that the move would push an extra 50,000 pensioners into poverty.",
      "It says this figure does not account for its ongoing drive to increase take-up of pension credit among an estimated 880,000 eligible pensioners not currently claiming the top-up.",
      "Winter fuel cut to put 50,000 into poverty next year",
      "How much is the winter fuel payment and who can still get it?",
      "Winter fuel payment is a lump-sum amount of \u00a3200 a year for pensioners under 80, increasing to \u00a3300 for over 80s, paid in November or December.",
      "It was introduced in 1997 as a universal payment to reassure pensioners they would be able to heat their homes as temperatures drop, although in practice recipients can spend it on whatever they want.",
      "But from this winter, it will be restricted to those who qualify for pension credit and other income-related benefits, meaning around 9 million pensioners will no longer get it.",
      "It did not feature in Labour's election manifesto and the move, announced three weeks after its return to power, caught many MPs by surprise.",
      "Ministers say means-testing the payment will save the Treasury \u00a31.4bn this year and is required to help fix a \"black hole\" in the Tories' spending plans for this year identified by a specially-commissioned spending audit in July.",
      "Scottish Labour has pledged to make the payment universal again if it forms the next Scottish government after elections in 2026.",
      "Overall state pensions went up 8.5% this year because the longstanding \"triple lock\" policy means payments were linked to rises in earnings.",
      "Poverty predictions",
      "Despite requests from MPs, the government did not disclose its internal assessment of the impact of the policy when a law to implement it went through Parliament.",
      "It prompted criticism from a House of Lords committee, which said the change was being introduced \"at a pace that does not permit appropriate scrutiny\".",
      "On Tuesday, Work and Pensions Secretary Liz Kendall told a Commons committee that her department estimated the move would lead to a 50,000 increase in the number of pensioners in relative poverty next year after housing costs.",
      "This had been revised down from an estimate of 100,000 made \"at the time of the original policy decision,\" she added.",
      "The figures are rounded to the nearest 50,000, with Kendall adding this meant \"small variations\" in the underlying numbers could \"lead to much larger changes in the rounded headline numbers\".",
      "The government estimates 1.9 million pensioners - around 15% - are currently in relative poverty, meaning their income is 60% less than the median average.",
      "It has estimated that around 880,000 pensioners who qualify for pension credit at the moment are not claiming it, and would therefore be eligible to continue to receive winter fuel payments if they did.",
      "The government has estimated that means-testing winter fuel payments will save \u00a31.4bn this year, based on around 100,000 pensioners out of those 880,000 coming forward to claim pension credit.",
      "The Treasury has said the scale of the take-up is the main uncertainty when it comes to working out how much the measure will save.",
      "Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Kyle said the government had been \"forced to take\" the decision \"because of the inheritance that we had from the previous administration\".",
      "He added that the decision does not \"sit easily with me,\" adding: \"We didn\u2019t come into office to do these things.",
      "\"We do all of these tough decisions with a very heavy heart,\" he added.",
      "His argument echoed that made by Kendall, who added the decision was not one \"this government wanted or expected to take\".",
      "'More political argument'",
      "However, some - though not all - Labour MPs privately believe in the merits of means-testing the benefit, questioning why the wealthiest pensioners should continue to receive it.",
      "Some believe that ministers should be more willing to argue for the decisions they have taken, as well as criticising their Conservative predecessors.",
      "\u201cWe need to make more of a positive, proud case for what we\u2019re doing,\u201d one Labour MP said.",
      "It is a sentiment shared over changes in the Budget to inheritance tax for farmers, which prompted protests in London on Tuesday.",
      "Some Labour MPs have been willing privately - though not publicly - to argue that it would be a good thing if the changes lead to a fall in the value of farmland.",
      "That feeling was echoed in public by former Labour cabinet minister Jim Murphy, who told BBC Newsnight the party needed to \"make a more political argument\" about the government's policies.",
      "He added that benefit rises linked to having children had gone up by less than pension payments, adding: \"Inequality is generational, and the generation that experiences it the most are the young\".",
      "\"Labour has often become a commentator about its own policy, rather than agitating for it,\" he added."

      "However, he stopped short of backing SNP calls for a UK government U-turn when the issue was debated at Holyrood.",
      "Speaking to reporters in Glasgow on Tuesday, Sarwar highlighted several areas where he had taken a different approach to UK Labour - citing his willingness to join striking workers on picket lines.",
      "First Minister John Swinney has been urged to find extra funding to provide universal coverage for winter fuel payments in his budget for 2025-26, which is due to be announced on 4 December.",
      "He indicated that it would cost about \u00a3190m to fund the new Holyrood-managed equivalent, the Pension Age Winter Heating Assistance.",
      "Swinney said the government was considering its budget plans, adding: \u201cBut the shortcut to sorting out this issue \u2013 this issue which is the making of the Labour government in Westminster \u2013 is for Anas Sarwar to demand that the Labour prime minister reverses the cut to winter fuel payments that were made by the Labour government.",
      "\u201cPeople in Scotland can\u2019t understand why a Labour government came into office and one of their first acts was to cut the winter fuel payments of pensioners.\u201d",
      "Social Justice Secretary Shirley-Anne Somerville accused Labour of  \"Orwellian double-think\".",
      "She said: \"Having just cut the winter fuel payment for millions of pensioners across the UK, they now expect people to believe that they are in fact on the side of pensioners.",
      "\u201cAnas Sarwar sat on his hands while his Westminster colleagues forced through this cut, and he must explain why Labour failed to back the reintroduction of the winter fuel payment just a few weeks ago in the Scottish Parliament.\u201d",
      "'Tough' decision",
      "Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has previously defended his \"tough\" decision to cut winter fuel payments.",
      "He also issued a \"guarantee\" that an increase in the state pension - which is set to rise by \u00a3460 per year in April - would \"outstrip\" losses for those who will not receive the winter fuel payment, which is either \u00a3200 or \u00a3300.",
      "However, the state pension increase will be spread over the year from next April, whereas the winter fuel payment is usually paid in November or December.",
      "UK Environment Secretary Steve Reed said Scottish Labour had \"made their choice\" and it was part of devolution that there would be differences across the UK.",
      "There are a few elements at play when it comes to this announcement.",
      "For one thing, Anas Sarwar has always said he's uncomfortable with the UK Labour government's criteria around who gets a winter fuel payment. He thinks it's too restrictive.",
      "Also, after Keir Starmer's rough start upon entering Downing Street, he's perhaps made the calculation that a bit of distance between him and UK Labour is no bad thing.",
      "Indeed, in a huddle with press this morning, Sarwar was keen to stress areas where he's taken a different approach (such as joining workers on picket lines).",
      "Remember the context here: there's a Holyrood election in 2026, and Scottish Labour won't want to be associated with any UK Labour unpopularity around that time.",
      "Finally, there's a bit of a challenge to the Scottish government in all of this.",
      "As the budget approaches, there are rumblings that Scottish ministers could throw some extra cash towards pensioners.",
      "In the wake of today's announcement Anas Sarwar can claim he made the first move.",
      "But there's no denying this also comes with an element of awkwardness - as Scottish Labour are acknowledging that the UK government's policy on winter fuel payments falls short.",

      "On a spring day, Hamid Khoshsiar decided to make the perilous journey into the European Union. He was 31 at the time, an Iranian refugee who had been living in Turkey for two years. But in 2019, he felt it was time to go.",
      "Starting out in Igneada, in the north of the country, he walked along a slippery, uneven trail for half a day, through dense forest and sharp shrubbery in the direction of Bulgaria. Eventually he reached the border.",
      "His best option, he decided, was to swim across a small river. The waters were mercifully calm. Packing his scant belongings into plastic bags, he waded in.",
      "\u201cThere was so much adrenaline in my blood,\u201d he remembers. \u201cThe only thing that was important to me was safety. All my mind was about that: am I going to find safety or not?\u201d",
      "It would take him 20 hours to reach safety in Bulgaria, where he now lives with refugee status. As for the journey, he says he could have died from dehydration had he not been found by a police patrol. Still, it was the best decision of his life.",
      "\u201cIt was worth it because I didn\u2019t have any other option. I was so lucky.\u201d",
      "Over the past five years, more and more migrants have decided to try their luck following the same path, known as the Eastern Mediterranean route. It starts in Turkey and moves into either Bulgaria or Greece; and then, for many, deeper in Europe.",
      "Whilst other routes - like the path from the north African coast to Italy - have seen a fall, the numbers entering Europe via this Eastern Mediterranean route tripled between 2021 and 2023 and is still rising, according to EU border agency Frontex.",
      "It now stands at well over 60,000 a year. Many are Afghan and a number are Turkish and Syrian. Some, eventually, end up on the shores of Britain.",
      "Since taking power, the Labour government has repeatedly promised to \u201csmash\u201d the smuggling gangs who lead them here.",
      "Sir Keir Starmer\u2019s strategy focuses heavily on policing. He has promised to treat smugglers like terrorists, disrupting their plans \u201cbefore they act\u201d. On 4 November, the prime minister announced plans to create a new Border Security Command, which the government say will have enhanced powers to trace suspected traffickers and shut down their bank accounts. One hundred additional specialist investigators will be assigned to the National Crime Agency (NCA), one of the UK bodies tasked with cracking down on people smugglers, while the Crown Prosecution Service will deliver charging decisions more quickly in international organised crime cases.",
      "But is it enough? After all, the Conservatives had their own version of Labour\u2019s slogan, promising to \u201cstop the boats\u201d - and yet in the year to June 2024, some 38,784 irregular arrivals were detected - 81% of them arrived in small boats.",
      "So what makes Labour think it will fare differently, and that its police-first strategy will work?",
      "The Today Podcast",
      "Special report: Europe\u2019s frontline against illegal migration",
      "Can you smash the gangs to stop the boats?",
      "Over the last week, as part of a series on BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme, we traced the path of migrants from Turkey to Bulgaria to the rest of Europe - the \u201cbiggest growth route\u201d for those travelling into Europe, according to the University of Oxford\u2019s Migration Observatory - in search of what it will really take to \u201csmash the gangs\u201d.",
      "When we talk about smuggling gangs, we tend to focus on the end of the process, such as the UK's relations with France, and on the movement of people across the English Channel, but our route marks the start of the journey: it\u2019s where migrants first enter Europe.",
      "Along the way,  we spoke to migrants who shared their complicated reasons for putting their lives in the hands of people smugglers. What soon became clear was the sheer magnitude of the government\u2019s task.",
      "Gateway to Europe: the Turkey challenge",
      "The crowded shopping bazaar in the Istanbul district of Esenyurt is popular with the thousands of Syrian refugees who live in the region. \u201cYou can see Syrian shops here,\u201d Husam, a Syrian refugee, told us as he showed us around after Friday prayers. \u201cMany were not here in 2015. You have falafel, shawarma - many shops for Syrian food. It was a comfortable, safe place for Syrians.\u201d But now the mood is darkening.",
      "\u201cIn the past few years it\u2019s not safe any more,\u201d he explains. \u201cThere are groups of racist people who don\u2019t like refugees. On public transportation you cannot speak comfortably in Arabic on your phone. People are attacked [for] speaking Arabic.\u201d",
      "Turkey has more refugees than any other country. It opened its borders to people fleeing the war in Syria in 2011; now there are upwards of three million Syrian refugees in Turkey, according to the UN. But Turks are getting restless. President Recep Erdogan has urged refugees - who he calls \u201cguests\u201d - to go home.",
      "Migrants without papers are being arrested and deported. Even those who have papers face being harassed, and now many who made temporary homes in Turkey want to leave - legally if possible - but, where necessary, they use people smugglers.",
      "All of this is being watched by Westminster. With so many people so desperate to move westwards, one of the British Government\u2019s prime tasks, if it is to keep its promise to reduce illegal arrivals, is to start cracking Turkey\u2019s people-smuggling model. And that starts with social media.",
      "For years, smugglers have used Facebook and other platforms to advertise safe passage between countries, often including prices and package deals such as \u201ckids go free\u201d.",
      "Over a traditional Syrian meat-and-rice dish of maqluba, Ali, a former footballer from Damascus, gets out his phone and shows us social media videos that promote smuggling routes. They are slick and professional, with pictures of boats and people looking joyous as they arrive in Greece.",
      "\u201cAbsolutely I\u2019m thinking about leaving,\u201d Ali admits. \u201cNot just me, all my friends.\u201d",
      "Britain is one of the destinations he has in mind, along with the Netherlands and Germany.",
      "Stemming the flow from Turkey",
      "The exodus from Turkey is not surprising, says Marc Pierini, EU ambassador to Turkey between 2006 and 2011. \u201cSyrian refugees in Turkey have over the past few years become the scapegoat\u2026 A whole xenophobic narrative has been [created] by the authorities.\u201d",
      "Turkey\u2019s poor economy is only adding to the problem, argues Murat Erdo\u011fan, a professor of migration studies at Ankara University, who is no relation to the president. Interest rates were raised to 40% last year amid soaring inflation.",
      "For years, successive European governments have attempted to crack down on the smuggling ring here by giving money and logistical support to Turkish police and coastguard. A 2016 deal between the EU and Turkey - in which Turkey was given aid in return for its help reducing the flow of migrants travelling to Greece on boats - was an early attempt to undermine the smuggling business model.",
      "But Rob Jones, director of operations at the NCA, says cracking down on the trade is complex - and even more difficult than policing the movement of illegal drugs. \u201cIt\u2019s harder, it\u2019s different, it\u2019s more organic,\u201d he says. \u201cIt relies on a series of informal trusted relationships\u201d.",
      "Smuggling gangs often use hawala - a payment method that avoids formal banking and instead relies on a network of agents to deliver cash across borders. \u201cThat means we don\u2019t have large amounts of cash moving between borders or even electronically, like we do with the drug trade,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s also difficult because it utilises ubiquitous social media apps which allow people to be handed between groups at ease. \u201c",
      "In Britain, ministers of successive governments have recognised this as part of the problem, as well as the need to tackle social media advertising. Since 2021, the NCA has worked with Meta, X, TikTok and YouTube to remove posts promoting smuggling services. By this summer, 12,000 posts had been deleted, the agency said.",
      "The newly appointed Border Security Commander, Martin Hewitt, has told us: \u201cWe will keep chipping away and undermining their business to the point where that is no longer viable and profitable.\u201d",
      "But our experience in Turkey showed us that - to date - it\u2019s still possible to connect with a smuggler at the click of a button.",
      "Crackdown at the border",
      "The NCA has highlighted a particular area that is a \u201ccrucible\u201d for organised immigration crime: the crossing between Turkey and Bulgaria, which marks the EU\u2019s external frontier.",
      "We visited the tiny Bulgarian mountain village of Shtit, a sleepy place with dirt roads and rusting farm machinery - a place that doesn\u2019t seem to hold much geopolitical significance, but that\u2019s right at the border, which is marked by a 4m high fence and razor wire.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s very sharp and it\u2019s almost impossible to climb with bare hands,\u201d says Hamid, the Iranian refugee who crossed it in 2019. \u201cUsually they\u2019re using ladders, but there\u2019s some places [along the fence] that they\u2019ve already cut.\u201d",
      "Our conversation is interrupted by a passing patrol car. Two uniformed officers warn us not to take photographs of the border; presumably, if shared on social media they can help migrants make the crossing.",
      "Nikolai, a chef in a local restaurant, tells us he has seen a marked increase in security in the area - many of the guards are from Germany and Poland, and are working in Bulgaria as part of the EU\u2019s border force, Frontex.",
      "Certainly, the Bulgarians have made strides in policing their side of the border. In recent years they have installed cameras, drones, and ramped up the number of security staff.",
      "This ring-of-steel-style system has had some success: the number of migrants crossing here has fallen in the last two years, says Atanas Rusev, director of the Security Programme at the Centre for Study of Democracy. But there are gaps.",
      "The porousness of the border is apparent about 32km down the road, at the Kapitan Andreevo crossing, uniting Greece, Bulgaria, and Turkey - the busiest such border in Europe. The terrain is mountainous, with parts covered by thick forests making it easy for migrants to go undetected.",
      "\u201cIn order to police you need thousands of people on the ground,\u201d Mr Rusev explains. \u201cYou cannot put a man every five metres - so you have these patrols that are moving across certain sections of the border. Then you have the fence, but the fence is not a big obstacle because you need a simple wooden ladder.\u201d",
      "The smuggling gangs are clever and \u201cknow the terrain very well\u201d, he explains. \u201cIf you think that you can stop these irregular flows just with policing and prosecution and securitising, it\u2019s a road to nowhere.\u201d",
      "Fines for carrying inflatable boats",
      "And they\u2019re not just trying to stop people. Many of the rubber inflatable boats used to smuggle migrants across the Channel are manufactured in Turkey and transported over this very border.",
      "One difficulty stopping the boats is that it is legal to carry inflatables across Europe; they might be used for a fishing trip.  But following talks with the UK, the Bulgarians have changed their customs regulations to say that only certain Turkish companies are licensed to export boats.",
      "Anyone found with an unlicensed vessel in the back of their car can face a \u20ac2,000 (\u00a31,666) euro fine. To help detect those boats is a dog, Adele, trained by the UK\u2019s National Crime Agency to sniff out rubber. Her harness carries both Bulgarian and UK flags.",
      "I point out to Valerie, the border agent showing us around, that smuggling gangs can make thousands of pounds of profit off each passenger. Perhaps the gangs are happy to risk a \u20ac2,000 fine?",
      "\u201cMaybe,\u201d comes the answer, \u201cbut we stop some.\u201d",
      "So where does this leave Britain?",
      "Back in Britain, the prime minister has suggested that policing, intelligence and more international cooperation is the answer. Our experience in Bulgaria of the attempt to disrupt the trade in boats being exported from Turkey highlights the benefits of this approach and also its limitations. Even with drones, cameras and security staff, thousands of people stream into the country illegally every year. It's certainly not a promising sign.",
      "And yet the government\u2019s heavy focus on policing and security has paid off in some ways. Earlier this month, Amanj Hasan Zada, who organised cross-Channel smuggling from his home in Lancashire and was feted as \u201cthe best smuggler\u201d, was convicted and given a 17-year sentence.",
      "Why so many prime ministers have failed to cut migration",
      "Trump and Xi Jinping\u2019s \u2018loving\u2019 relationship has soured - can they rebuild it?",
      "'Anointed by God': The Christians who see Trump as their saviour",
      "Peter Walsh, head of the Migration Observatory, is more optimistic than some about Labour\u2019s beefed-up security approach, pointing out that it\u2019s possible to reduce the flow of people. But he stresses that the success or failure ultimately depends on global trends in people smuggling, over which UK ministers have little control.",
      "He also fears police might end up in a game of whack-a-mole. \u201cThe people most directly involved in smuggling activity can [be] apprehended - but they can quickly be replaced.\u201d",
      "Which poses a new question. As he puts it: can you apprehend people more quickly than they can be replaced?",
      "Alternative routes",
      "There are alternative strategies to police-first - but each is loaded with its own problems. For example, by giving money to countries such as Syria, it\u2019s possible to tackle what are termed the \u201croot causes\u201d of migration so there\u2019s less need for refugees to flee. The prime minister made a gesture to this strategy in the summer, pledging \u00a384m for education and employment opportunities in Africa and Middle East. But even the most optimistic of humanitarians don\u2019t think this is a solution in the short- or even medium-term, or that \u00a384m is enough to fix the problems.",
      "Then there\u2019s the prospect of bilateral deals. The \u201cgold standard\u201d for the UK would be to strike a generous beach-returns deal with France, says Mr Walsh, in which France agrees to take back migrants who arrive via the Channel and intercept boats. \u201cBut what\u2019s in it for France?\u201d Mr Walsh asks.",
      "Finally there\u2019s the option of offering \u201csafe and legal\u201d routes for refugees to enter Britain, the policy preferred by some charities. But other experts suggest this would amount only to a few thousand people per year - and attempt to seriously ramp up numbers may become politically toxic.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s always going to be more people that want to arrive than can arrive,\u201c added Mr Walsh. And those people will make it through any means necessary.",
      "Of everything we saw in Turkey and Bulgaria, one memory stays with me that proves this very point. It was at the Harmanli refugee camp, the largest in Bulgaria. There, we met a group of 10 Syrian men who had recently made the crossing from Turkey. Their smugglers knew exactly where they could climb over the fence, they told us.",
      "But what about the hi-tech cameras, the drones, and the extra police, I asked? They just shrugged. It didn\u2019t seem like they\u2019d struggled.",
      "It impressed upon me the enormity of Labour\u2019s task. After all, ministers can throw whatever resources they want at the issue of gangs but if migrants are determined enough, and if the money for gangsters is tempting enough, some will always find a way through.",
      "Mr Walsh is also sceptical of whether people smuggling gangs can be cracked at scale, drawing the comparison of drugs gangs. \u201dThere\u2019s a fair amount of investment that goes into controlling the sale of illicit drugs, yet they continue,\u201d he argues. \u201cSo the idea that you can stamp it out entirely is just not feasible.",
      "\u201cYes you can make a difference, but it\u2019s impossible to reduce it to zero.\u201d",
      "No-one who works with migrants, no-one who works on border security, would ever say the sort of words or phrases routinely in political slogans: \u201cstop the boats\u201d or \u201csmash the gangs\u201d. What they talk about instead is a much more modest ambition of making it harder to cross borders without the right paperwork, reducing the number who do so and disrupting the people smugglers. But they all accept that those who really want to make it from one side of the border to the other will probably eventually succeed.",

    "published": "Wed, 20 Nov 2024 00:27:11 GMT",
    "summary": "Why has the inheritance tax for farmers argument got so noisy, so quickly?",
    "story": [
      "The farmers' demonstration was best summed up in two images: real tractors being driven by farmers around Parliament Square, and beside them a collection of toy tractors being pedalled around by their children.",
      "They illustrated the essence of the farmers\u2019 argument: there is a deep-seated cultural expectation that they will pass on their farm to the next generation.",
      "For many, it feels like a deep responsibility that stretches high into their family tree, and so the expectation falls upon them to ensure the very thing their forebears did for them they manage to as well \u2013 hand it down to their sons and daughters.",
      "As a reporter, I love covering protests and marches at Westminster.",
      "They are an essential megaphone in the never-ending conversation of our democracy.",
      "I have been turning up at them with a microphone and camera for 20 years \u2013 to witness and scrutinise those making the most of their much-cherished right to come to London and \u2013 often \u2013 shout at the government.",
      "I love them because people sufficiently passionate about their cause to trek to the capital and then make a public, almost certainly contentious, argument often deserve to be listened to and should be vigorously questioned too.",
      "And, for me, those conversations offer an insight into not just what those protesting think, but why they think it.",
      "This gathering of farmers left me with three thoughts:",
      "Firstly, as we have already explored, there is the huge power of the cultural expectation of handing on a farm to the next generation.",
      "It is not just a business, but an identity, a belonging, a geographical rootedness \u2013 and the prospect of not being able to pass it on generates huge anger and emotion.",
      "That is a big part of the explanation for why this argument has got so noisy, so quickly.",
      "Secondly, contested notions of fairness are so often central to the most contentious political arguments, and this one is no different.",
      "The government argues existing inheritance tax isn\u2019t fair or sustainable \u2013 as everyone else sufficiently well off to pay it is charged 40% and farmers are charged nothing.",
      "Ministers also argue the exemptions have tempted rich folk to buy up farm land \u2013 pushing up its value \u2013 primarily to avoid inheritance tax.",
      "And, as they are at pains to point out over and over again, they insist the vast majority of family farms will be unaffected and those that are will be charged 20%, half the rate charged to anyone else caught within its grasp.",
      "Plus, they say, schools and hospitals desperately need more money.",
      "Others say the farmers are a noisy, well-organised lobby group seeking to shield their often considerable wealth and perpetuate a privilege to the exclusion of others.",
      "And all this brings us to the third big question here: what does it mean to be rich?",
      "Talking to farmers, very quickly our conversation would often involve very big numbers - talk of assets running into a few million pounds.",
      "These are huge figures that point to considerable wealth and yet the farmers insist, for two reasons, they are not rich.",
      "Their annual income is often modest, they point out - and they don\u2019t value their farm in numerical terms, but in emotional ones. The prospect of selling it horrifies them; handing it on is what they seek to do.",
      "The farmers insist they are determined to press on with their campaign.",
      "Ministers insist they are determined to press on with their plans for change.",
      "You may choose to sympathise with the farmers\u2019 arguments or not \u2013 or the government\u2019s arguments, or not \u2013 but the protests offer an insight into what contributes to the view of many of the farmers, and why them backing down doesn\u2019t seem likely any time soon.",

      "That is why he wants Europe to spend more on its defence \u2013 so he can deploy US forces to the Pacific.",
      "And that is why Europeans are braced for fresh pressure from the US to adopt a tougher approach to China.",
      "Many in the US think the UK and the EU are trying to curry favour in Beijing by being less hostile than Washington.",
      "So the prime minister is trying to engage more closely with China, and at the very least be more consistent than his predecessors.",
      "Whether that policy survives contact with the second Trump presidency remains to be seen."

    "published": "Sat, 16 Nov 2024 13:12:37 GMT",
    "summary": "Multiple sources say the Treasury is deeply nervous about the cost of fixing social care, and that the PM is yet to decide how to proceed.",
    "story": [
      "Sir Keir Starmer\u2019s first five months have produced little sign of a plan for Labour\u2019s promised National Care Service \u2013 and now I\u2019m told there is a \u201cgenuine impasse\u201d at the top of government over what to do about social care.",
      "Health Secretary Wes Streeting publicly acknowledges \u201cwe can\u2019t solve the NHS crisis\u201d without improving what a government source describes as an \u201cappalling\u201d situation, in a system that\u2019s meant to look after vulnerable and elderly adults in England.",
      "But multiple sources tell me the Treasury is deeply nervous about the cost and that the prime minister is yet to make a decision on how to proceed.",
      "Talks have so far failed to decide even whether to hold another review of the system. \u201cDither, dither, dither,\u201d said one insider involved in the discussions.",
      "But another source said: \u201cEveryone wants to fix it but we don\u2019t want to embark on something that then doesn\u2019t happen.\u201d",
      "I understand the prime minister, health secretary and the Chancellor Rachel Reeves are due to meet a week on Monday to try to make some progress.",
      "What options do they have?",
      "There is little controversy about the scale of the problem in social care, the system that helps older and disabled people with day-to-day tasks like washing, dressing, getting out of bed, eating and medication.",
      "There are as many as 500,000 people waiting for care. Council budgets are stretched, some teetering on the edge of bankruptcy, in part because of care costs. As the population ages, thousands upon thousands of people are stuck without the care they need, and thousands more stuck in hospital because there isn\u2019t the support they need at home.",
      "Labour has given little detail on what its National Care Service would look like, but long-term reform would likely aim to address the shortage of care, the length of waiting lists, and the costs for people who don't qualify for free care, which can be crippling for families.",
      "Why Starmer\u2019s NHS reforms may give you a sense of deja-vu",
      "No extra NHS funding without reform, says PM",
      "Ministers are considering whether to create a Royal Commission to look at the issue or a government-backed independent review, tipped to be led by the straight-talking Whitehall troubleshooter Dame Louise Casey.",
      "The advantage of a Royal Commission? It\u2019s not party political, so theoretically can bind every politician to back its solutions and make the warring parties work together.",
      "The downside? It could take two or three years, pushing possible fixes to the urgent problems until after the next election.",
      "An independent review of a year to 18 months could change things quicker. Without the kudos of the King, any plans would be easier for opposition politicians to reject \u2013 but Labour has a once-in-a-generation majority to vote through big reforms.",
      "There are nerves, however, at the top of government about what any review might recommend. If it suggests an expensive new system quickly, then that would need billions in extra tax. Does the government have a mandate for that in this parliamentary term, having ruled out changes to the main tax rates?",
      "If a review process took longer, would any political party want to go into the next election asking voters to pay more - even for the best of reasons, a shiny new social care system?",
      "\u2018Same old stalemate\u2019",
      "In truth, conversations about the process are only a symbol of the actual dilemma \u2013 not just what to do, but how to pay.",
      "The Department of Health wants to get on with the process. The Treasury agrees that it\u2019s a very serious problem that the government ought to fix (and people caught up in the system, often stuck in hospital, are costly to the whole NHS too). Yet the chancellor is understood to be nervous about the cost of any fix, which would run to many billions.",
      "One source told me: \u201cThe Treasury is the block.\u201d But a department insider rejects that characterisation, and says: \u201cNo one doubts the issue is huge, but any solution is expensive \u2013 everything is a trade-off.\u201d",
      "Others suggest Reeves wants reform but also wants to be sure of a full political backing from the neighbours at No 10. So it\u2019s suggested both Streeting and Reeves are looking to Sir Keir.",
      "A No 10 source told me the prime minister is \u201canimated by solving the issue and is keen to proceed\u201d, hence the meeting planned with the health secretary and chancellor in the next fortnight. The source denies the accusation of \u201cdither\u201d, saying it takes time to work out the right moves.",
      "There is no suggestion this is a bruising split between ministers.",
      "But another source familiar with the process told me: \"As soon as the election was out of the way we went back into the same old stalemate.\" In other words, the Department of Health says please, the Treasury says no, and No 10 wants more time to think.",
      "\u2018It\u2019s almost too late\u2019",
      "Inside the care sector itself, one leader says people are \u201cworn\u201d by the debate between different parts of government when the need for change is urgent. Another care source tells me \u201cit\u2019s already almost too late\u201d and is upset at how the industry has been treated so far.",
      "They say existing government plans and the decisions in the Budget have made life harder. Asking care providers to pay the extra costs of employers\u2019 national insurance means that, effectively, \u201cpublic services are charged to pay for a black hole in (you guessed it) public services\u201d, they say.",
      "The NHS itself will be exempt from those increased costs but, as things stand, not-for-profit organisations including some care charities providing public services will have to pay.",
      "Sign up for the Off Air with Laura K newsletter to get Laura Kuenssberg's expert insight and insider stories every week, emailed directly to you.",
      "A group of them have written to the chancellor as part of a grassroots campaign called Providers Unite, warning the increased payments could top \u00a31bn. They have asked Reeves to look again at the changes or face \u201ca systematic collapse of community care services across Britain\u201d.",
      "The chancellor told us after the Budget she is \u201cnot immune\u201d to pleas from particular sectors, but there is no chance of her reversing the whole policy.",
      "On top of charging more National Insurance, ministers are creating a negotiating body to improve pay and conditions for care staff. While the industry is broadly supportive of that aim, it will increase costs, and many believe they just can\u2019t cover it without extra funding.",
      "There is an obvious eagerness for the government to get on with the conversation about how to fix the system that cares for the most vulnerable adults in the long term. But, wearily, a source told me conversation in the industry is \u201cso dominated by funding emergencies now, [long-term reform] is second order\u201d.",
      "Pressure builds for a decision",
      "When the prime minister, Streeting and Reeves sit down to consider what to do about social care in a week or so, don\u2019t expect a sudden revelation or a shiny new plan. One source told me \u2013 in a line worthy of the sitcom Yes Minister \u2013 that the trio might \u201cdecide to decide, decide to delay deciding, or\u2026 decide not to decide\u201d.",
      "But the pressure is building on them to make a call.",
      "While the Conservatives promised then failed multiple times to follow through with big changes to the system, the newly emboldened Lib Dems put social care right at the centre of their successful election campaign.",
      "It\u2019s the party\u2019s signature issue, and rarely a day goes by without them pursuing a political opportunity to press the case. The Lib Dem leader Sir Ed Davey, who will join me on tomorrow's show, said that any investment in the NHS would be an \"expensive failure\" without social care reform.",
      "\"Ministers need to get a grip, and quickly,\" he said. \"The cross-party talks we've been campaigning for should start now, but there are urgent actions the government should take regardless,\" such as a higher minimum wage for care workers.",
      "And a spokesperson for the Conservatives said: \"The Labour Party are piling on costs for social care providers and charities. The Local Government Association has warned that any extra funding will be consumed by the costs as a result of Labour\u2019s budget.\"",
      "Few in government would deny that a solution for social care is long overdue. Few in government would deny that patients are being let down, and families are being left without the support they need. And few in government would deny that Sir Keir\u2019s mission to sort out the NHS is hampered by a lack of action.",
      "A source familiar with the dilemmas told me it \u201cbeggars belief\u201d that minsters can talk about giving the NHS extra billions and promising reform without doing the same for social care.",
      "Yet nobody wants to repeat previous governments\u2019 pattern, where plans were drawn up, pitched to the public, then ditched (the Scottish Government has again shelved plans for its promised National Care Service).",

      "UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer told the conference that he wants the UK to have more \"ambitious\" climate goals.",

      "However the leaders of some of the largest economies - and biggest carbon emitters - are notably absent from COP29.",
      "US President Joe Biden, China's Xi Jinping and France's Emmanuel Macron are not attending. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, Germany\u2019s Olaf Schulz and India\u2019s Narendra Modi will also not be there.",
      "They are staying away for a range of reasons, but their absence could undermine the event's significance.",
      "Leaders who do attend will also have lots of other issues on their minds, including two expensive and difficult wars in the Middle East and in Ukraine, and global financial problems.",
      "\"No world leader is arriving with climate change at the number one spot in their inbox,\" says Oxford University's Prof Thomas Hale.",

      "During COP29 key experts, including former UN Secretary General Ban-Ki Moon and former UN climate chief Christiana Figueres, said the COP process is \"no longer fit for purpose\".",
      "They said: \"Its current structure simply cannot deliver the change at exponential speed and scale, which is essential to ensure a safe climate landing for humanity.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 19 Nov 2024 13:02:42 GMT",
    "summary": "Estimates of the number of farms affected range from 100 to 70,000.",
    "story": [
      "There has been an outcry from many farmers following the changes to inheritance tax for farms announced in the Budget. Farmers have travelled to London and are taking part in a rally near Parliament to highlight their concerns.",
      "From April 2026, inherited agricultural assets worth more than \u00a31m, which were previously exempt, will have to pay inheritance tax at 20% - half the usual rate.",
      "There have been different claims about how many farms will be affected.",
      "These vary from as many as 70,000 to as few as 500.",
      "Where does the 70,000 figure come from?",
      "It comes from the Country Land and Business Association whose president, Victoria Vyvyan said: \"We estimate that capping agricultural property relief at \u00a31m could harm 70,000 UK farms, damaging family businesses and destabilising food security.\"",
      "It was also used by Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey, who said the government needed to \"listen to rural communities\" and reverse the change.",
      "It is not a figure for the number of estates that will have to pay inheritance tax each year, it is an estimate of the total number of farms worth enough to pay.",
      "There are a couple of ways to get to that.",
      "Yiorgos Gadanakis, associate professor of agricultural business management at the University of Reading, pointed to various sources, including Defra's Farm Business Survey, which suggest that between about 30 and 35% of farms in the UK could be valued at over \u00a31m.",
      "As there are about 209,000 farm holdings in the UK, that gives an estimate of between 62,700 and 73,150.",
      "Another way is to look at the number of farms that are bigger than about 200 acres (81 hectares), because at average land prices that would be enough to mean inheritance tax was due. That figure comes out at about 70,000.",
      "But of course a farm will only be affected once it is inherited, so 70,000 is not necessarily the right number to use.",
      "Where does the 500 figure come from?",
      "It comes from the Treasury, which says it expects 500 estates to be affected by the changes each year.",
      "There were a total of 462 inherited farms valued above \u00a31m in 2021-22, according to HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC):",
      "345 valued between \u00a31m and \u00a32.5m80 at \u00a32.5m to \u00a35m37 above \u00a35m",
      "345 valued between \u00a31m and \u00a32.5m",
      "80 at \u00a32.5m to \u00a35m",
      "37 above \u00a35m",
      "Under the new rules, those 462 farms would be affected by the 20% inheritance tax on any value above \u00a31m (not on the whole value). The normal rate of inheritance tax is 40%.",
      "However, as Dan Neidle - founder of the independent Tax Policy Associates - points out, like for the rest of the population, there is no inheritance tax to be paid on the value of property up to \u00a3325,000, bringing the untaxed total to \u00a31.325m.",
      "If a farmer is married, his or her spouse would be able to pass on another \u00a31.325m tax free, taking the total untaxed amount to \u00a32.65m.",
      "There were 117 farms valued above \u00a32.5m in 2021-22, according to the HMRC figures.",
      "In addition, there is a \u00a3175,000 tax-free allowance on a main residence when it is  being passed on to children or grandchildren. This brings the total untaxed amount for a farming couple to up to \u00a33m.",
      "Paul Johnson, the director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS), an independent economy think-tank, told Sky News: \"The changes will affect a remarkably small number of some of the most valuable farms.\"",
      "He added: \"[Farms are] still more generously treated, actually, than farms used to be in decades past.\"",
      "Steve Reed, the secretary of state for the environment, food and rural affairs, confirmed the \"vast majority\" of farmers will not be affected by changes. Writing in the Telegraph, he said \"only the richest estates will be asked to pay\".",
      "He also wrote: \"It\u2019s become the most effective way for the super-rich to avoid paying their inheritance tax.\"",
      "Analysis by the property consultants Strutt & Parker found that 40% of farms that were sold last year in England were bought by investors while 45% were bought by working farmers.",
      "Farmers 'betrayed' by \u00a31m inheritance tax relief cap",
      "Farmers mull selling or protests over tax change",
      "Who pays inheritance tax?",
      "How much could be raised?",
      "The chief secretary to the Treasury, Darren Jones, has said that the inheritance tax exemptions currently cost \"about \u00a31bn a year for taxpayers\".",
      "The Treasury expects that the changes to inheritance tax , as well as changes to Business Tax Relief, will raise \u00a3230m in 2026-27, the first year of their introduction. This rises to \u00a3520m by the end of the forecast in 2029-30.",
      "But the independent Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) warns that there is high uncertainty around these figures.",
      "Is the tax affordable?",
      "Sam Kirkham, who specialises in agriculture at Albert Goodman accountants, says \"people look at the value of farms and think the farmers must be wealthy\".",
      "But she says if the farm passes down to the next generation to continue to produce food, they never get to realise that capital.",
      "And she adds farm profits are too low to meet the additional cost of inheritance tax.",
      "Government research suggests that an average farm last year made a profit of about \u00a345,300, although that may be overstated as it is based on a survey that excluded farms that bring in the least money.",
      "Other government figures suggest that the average return on capital for farms (the amount of value farmers can extract from things like farmland and machinery by growing crops for example) is only about 0.5%, which is low compared with other businesses.",
      "The government points out that people inheriting farmland would have 10 years to pay the inheritance tax bill interest-free, unlike other inheritance tax, which needs to be paid immediately.",
      "UPDATE 4 November: The unit on a measure of area was corrected from hectares to acres. A sentence was added detailing the residence nil-rate band rate of inheritance tax.",

    "summary": "Countries around the world are building new nuclear power stations.",
    "story": [
      "A decade ago, it seemed as though the global nuclear industry was in an irreversible decline.",
      "Concerns over safety, cost, and what to do with radioactive waste had sapped enthusiasm for a technology once seen as a revolutionary source of abundant cheap energy.",
      "Yet now there is widespread talk of a revival, fuelled by tech giants Microsoft, Google and Amazon all announcing investments in the sector, as well as the growing pressures on wealthy nations to curb their carbon emissions.",
      "But how real is the comeback?",
      "When commercial nuclear power was first developed in the 1950s and 1960s, governments were seduced by its seemingly unlimited potential.",
      "Nuclear reactors could harness and control the same awesome forces released by atomic bombs - to provide electricity for millions of homes. With a single kilogram of uranium yielding some 20,000 times as much energy as a kilogram of coal, it seemed like the future.",
      "But the technology also inspired public fear. And that fear seemed to be justified by the Chernobyl disaster, which spread radioactive contamination across Europe in early 1986.",
      "It fuelled widespread public and political opposition \u2013 and slowed the growth of the industry.",
      "Another accident, at the Fukushima Daichi plant in Japan in 2011, re-energised concerns about nuclear safety. Japan itself shut down all of its reactors in the immediate aftermath, and only 12 have since restarted.",
      "Germany decided to phase out nuclear power altogether. Other countries scaled back plans to invest in new power plants, or extend the lives of ageing facilities.",
      "According to the International Atomic Energy Agency, this led to the loss of 48GW of electric power generation globally between 2011 and 2020.",
      "But nuclear development did not stop. In China, for example, there were 13 nuclear reactors in 2011. There are now 55, with another 23 under construction.",
      "For Beijing, scrambling to meet rapidly growing electricity demand, nuclear had, and still has, a vital role to play.",
      "Now interest in the sector seems to be growing elsewhere once again. This is partly because developed countries are hunting for ways to meet energy demand, while striving to meet emissions reduction targets under the Paris Agreement.",
      "With 2024 projected to be the warmest year on record, the pressure to cut carbon emissions is mounting. A renewed focus on energy security, in the wake of Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, has also been a factor.",
      "South Korea, for example, recently scrapped plans to phase out its large fleet of nuclear power stations over the next four decades \u2013 and will build more instead.",
      "And France has reversed plans to reduce its own reliance on nuclear energy, which provides 70% of its electricity. Instead, it wants to build up to eight new reactors.",
      "In addition, last week the US government reaffirmed at the United Nations Climate Change Conference, or Cop29, held in Azerbaijan, that it intends to triple nuclear power generation by 2050.",
      "The White House had originally pledged to do this on the side lines of last year's conference, Cop28. A total of 31 countries have now agreed to try to triple their use of nuclear power by 2050, including the UK, France and Japan.",
      "Also at Cop29, which ends on Friday, 22 November, the US and UK announced that they would collaborate to speed up the development of new nuclear power technology.",
      "This follows after it was agreed in the final statement or \u201cstocktake\u201d of last year's Cop28 that nuclear should be one of the zero or low emission technologies to be \u201caccelerated\u201d to help combat climate change.",
      "But hunger for clean power is not just coming from governments. Technology giants are striving to develop more and more applications that use artificial intelligence.",
      "Yet AI relies on data \u2013 and data centres need constant, reliable electricity. According to Barclays Research, data centres account for 3.5% of electricity consumption in the US today, but that figure could rise to more than 9% by the end of the decade.",
      "In September, Microsoft signed a 20-year deal to buy power from Constellation Energy, which will lead to the reopening of the infamous Three Mile Island power station in Pennsylvania \u2013 the site of the worst nuclear accident in US history, where a reactor suffered a partial meltdown in 1979.",
      "Despite its tainted public image, another reactor at the plant continued to generate electricity until 2019. Constellation\u2019s chief executive Joe Dominguez described the deal to reopen it as a \"powerful symbol of the rebirth of nuclear power as a clean and reliable energy resource\".",
      "Other tech giants have taken a different approach. Google plans to buy energy produced from a handful of so-called Small Modular Reactors or SMRs \u2013 a nascent technology intended to make nuclear energy easier and cheaper to deploy. Amazon is also supporting SMR development and construction.",
      "SMRs themselves are being promoted, in part, as a solution to one of the biggest drawbacks facing nuclear power today. In western nations, new power stations have to be built to exacting modern safety standards. This makes them prohibitively expensive and complicated to build.",
      "Hinkley Point C is a good example. Britain\u2019s first new nuclear power station since the mid-1990s is being built on a stretch of remote coastline in southwest England.",
      "It is meant to be the first of a batch of new plants to replace the country\u2019s ageing reactor fleet. But the project is running some five years behind schedule and will cost up to \u00a39bn ($11.5bn) more than planned.",
      "It is not an isolated case. The US\u2019s newest reactors at Plant Vogtle in Georgia opened seven years late, and cost more than $35bn \u2013 well over double their original budget.",
      "SMRs are designed to solve this problem. They will be smaller than traditional reactors, using standardised parts that can be assembled quickly, at sites close to where the power is needed.",
      "But while there are some 80 different designs under development globally, according to the International Atomic Energy Agency, the concept has yet to be proven commercially.",
      "Opinions about nuclear power remain highly polarised. Supporters claim the technology is indispensable if climate targets are to be reached. Among them is Rod Adams, whose Nucleation Capital fund promotes investment in nuclear technology.",
      "\u201cNuclear fission has a seven-decade history showing it is one of the safest power sources available,\" he explains.",
      "\u201cIt is a durable, reliable source of power with low ongoing costs already, but capital costs have been too high in Western countries.\"",
      "Opponents though, insist nuclear power is not the answer.",
      "According to Professor M.V. Ramana of the University of British Columbia, it is \u201ca folly to consider nuclear energy as clean\u201d.  It is, he says, \"one of the most expensive ways to generate electricity. Investing in cheaper low-carbon sources of energy will provide more emissions reductions per dollar.\"",
      "If current trends do herald a new nuclear age, one old problem remains. After 70 years of atomic power, there is still disagreement over what to do with the accumulated radioactive waste - some of which will remain hazardous for hundreds of thousands of years.",
      "The answer being pursued by many governments is geological disposal - burying the waste in sealed tunnels deep underground. But only one country, Finland, has actually built such a facility, while environmentalists and anti-nuclear campaigners argue that dumping waste out of sight and out of mind is simply too risky.",
      "Solving that conundrum may be a key factor in dictating whether there really will be a new age of nuclear power.",

    "title": "Living in Delhi smog is like watching a dystopian film again and again",
    "published": "Wed, 20 Nov 2024 02:34:19 GMT",
    "summary": "Toxic, deadly, poisonous - these words are back in the headlines as Delhi\u2019s pollution spikes again.",
    "story": [
      "Winter has come to Delhi and with it, a familiar sense of gloom. The sky here is grey and there is a thick, visible blanket of smog.",
      "If you stay outdoors for more than a few minutes, you can almost taste ash. You will feel breathless within minutes if you try to run or even walk at a brisk pace in the smog.",
      "Newspapers are back to using words like \"toxic\", \"deadly\" and \"poisonous\" in their main headlines.",
      "Most schools have been shut and people have been advised to stay indoors - though those whose livelihoods depend on working outdoors can\u2019t afford to do so.",
      "Delhi\u2019s air quality score was somewhere between 1,200 and 1,500 on Monday and Tuesday, according to different monitoring agencies. The acceptable limit is under than 100.",
      "These scores measure the levels of particulate matter - called PM 2.5 and PM10 - in the air. These tiny particles can enter the lungs and cause a host of diseases.",
      "On social media, people have been expressing shock, disappointment and anguish that it\u2019s all happening again.",
      "Along with the gloom, there is a strong sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu - like we have seen this all many times before in the past 15 years.",
      "I recorded this video of my drive to the office in 2017, when smog had reduced visibility to less than 2m.",
      "On Tuesday, my drive to the office seemed even worse.",
      "And we have covered every twist and turn of this story in the past two decades.",
      "We have reported how pollution is making people sick and reducing their life expectancy reducing their life expectancy.",
      "We have reported on India's Supreme Court ordering the government to take urgent steps to curb pollution every year. The court has done the same this year.",
      "We have reported on how pollution affects children the most.",
      "We have written about how politicians blame each other for the problem every year.",
      "We have discussed the root cause of the problem.",
      "We have also talked about solutions - both the ones that marginally worked and the ones that failed miserably.",
      "We have reported on how pollution affects the poorest the most and how many don\u2019t have a choice but to go out and work in the smog.",
      "Covering this story feels like watching (and being in) the same dystopian film every year - following the same characters, plot and script. The outcome is always the same - nothing changes.",
      "The parks are empty again - people, particularly children and the elderly, have been told to stay indoors.",
      "Those who must work - daily-wage labourers, rickshaw pullers, delivery riders - are coughing but still going out.",
      "Hospitals are seeing an increasing number of people coming in with respiratory problems.",
      "And amid all this, we are back to the same question again - why does nothing change?",
      "The simple answer is that solving Delhi's air problem requires monumental efforts and co-ordination.",
      "The sources of the problem are many. One of them is the practice of farmers burning crop remains to clear their fields quickly to sow seeds for the next yield.",
      "This mostly happens in the neighbouring states of Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh. The smoke from the farm fires engulfs Delhi every winter and hangs low in the atmosphere as wind speeds reduce during winter months.",
      "But farmers can\u2019t be entirely blamed for this because this is the cheapest way of clearing fields.",
      "Different governments have talked about providing machines and financial incentives to stop crop burning, but very little has happened on the ground.",
      "Delhi itself produces a huge chunk of the pollution - emission from vehicles, construction and factories.",
      "Every year, in the winter months, people get angry, journalists write and produce reports, politicians blame each other and courts fume - until we do it all over again the next year.",
      "A public health emergency like this would spark mass protests in most democracies. But the anger in Delhi is mostly limited to social media.",
      "Activists say the reason is that pollution doesn\u2019t cause immediate problems for most people. Ingesting high levels of PM2.5 causes health to deteriorate slowly. A Lancet study found that pollution led to more than 2.3 million premature deaths in India in 2019.",
      "And then there is the class divide. People who can afford to temporarily leave the city do that, those who can buy air purifiers do that, and those who can vent on social media do that.",
      "The rest, who don't have these options, just go about their lives.",
      "The collective angst has so far not resulted in a massive protest and, as the Supreme Court once observed, politicians just \u201cpass the buck\u201d and wait for the season to get over.",
      "Experts say governments at the federal level and in different states need to leave their party politics behind and work together to solve this problem. They need to focus on long-term solutions.",
      "And citizens need to hold politicians accountable and courts have to pass decisive orders months before the pollution worsens.",
      "This year, we are again in the thick of the season and temporary measures have been announced, like banning construction work.",
      "But can these bring Delhi's elusive blue skies back? The evidence from the past few years doesn\u2019t give much hope.",

    "story": [
      "With her signature shawl draped over her shoulders and silver hair pulled back from her face, Jane Goodall exudes serenity - even over our slightly blurry video call.",
      "In a Vienna hotel room, a press team and a small group of filmmakers, who are documenting her latest speaking tour, fuss around her.",
      "The famous primatologist and conservationist settles into a high-backed chair that dwarfs her slender frame.",
      "On my screen I can see that behind her, on a shelf, is her toy monkey, Mr H.",
      "The toy was given to her nearly 30 years ago by a friend and has travelled the world with her. Dr Goodall is now 90 years of age, and she and Mr H are still travelling.",
      "\u201cI am a little bit exhausted,\u201d she admits. \u201cI\u2019ve come here from Paris. And after here I go to Berlin, then Geneva. I\u2019m on this tour talking about the danger to the environment and some of the remedies,\u201d she says.",
      "\u2018The sixth great extinction is happening now\u2019",
      "One of the remedies she wants to talk about today is a tree-planting and habitat restoration mission that her eponymous foundation and non-profit technology company, Ecosia, are carrying out in Uganda. Over the past five years, with the help of local communities and smallholder farmers, the organisations have planted nearly two million trees.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re in the midst of the sixth great extinction,\u201d Dr Goodall tells me during our interview for BBC Radio 4\u2019s Inside Science. \u201cThe more we can do to restore nature and protect existing forests, the better.\u201d",
      "The primary aim of this project is to restore the threatened habitat of Uganda\u2019s 5,000 chimpanzees. Dr Goodall has studied and campaigned to protect the primates for decades. But the activist also wants to highlight the threat that deforestation poses to our climate.",
      "\u201cTrees have to grow to a certain size before they can really do their work,\u201d she says. \u201cBut all this [tree-planting] is helping to absorb carbon dioxide.\u201d",
      "\u2018Window of time to save climate is closing\u2019",
      "This week, world leaders have gathered in Baku, Azerbaijan, for COP29 - the latest round of UN climate talks.",
      "And Dr Goodall says taking action to slow down the warming of our planet is more urgent than ever.",
      "\u201cWe still have a window of time to start slowing down climate change and loss of biodiversity,\u201d Dr Goodall says. \u201cBut it's a window that's closing.\u201d",
      "Destruction of forests, and other wild places, she points out, is intrinsically linked to the climate crisis.",
      "\u201cSo much has changed in my lifetime,\u201d she says, recalling that in the forests of Tanzania where she began studying chimps more than 60 years ago, \u201cyou used to be able to set your calendar by the timing of the two rainy seasons\u201d.",
      "\u201cNow, sometimes it rains in the dry season, and sometimes it's dry in the wet season. It means the trees are fruiting at the wrong time, which upsets the chimpanzees, and also the insects and the birds.\u201d",
      "Over the decades that she has studied and campaigned to protect the habitat of wild chimpanzees, she says she has seen the destruction of forests across Africa: \u201cAnd I've seen the decrease in chimpanzee numbers.",
      "\u201cIf we don't get together and impose tough regulations on what people are able to do to the environment - if we don't rapidly move away from fossil fuel, if we don't put a stop to industrial farming, that's destroying the environment and killing the soil, having a devastating effect on biodiversity - the future ultimately is doomed.\u201d",
      "\u2018He looked into my eyes and squeezed my fingers\u2019",
      "Hearing her speak in this way gives me a glimpse of a toughness that belies her well-spoken, gentle demeanour. When Jane Goodall began observing and studying chimpanzees in Gombe Stream National Park in Tanzania, she was a trailblazer. Her research, now considered groundbreaking, was controversial.",
      "She was the first person to witness and document chimpanzees making and using tools \u2013 the primates prepared sticks to fish for termites. Prior to her observations, that was a trait that was thought to be uniquely human.",
      "She revealed that the animals form strong family bonds - and even that they engage in warfare over territory.",
      "But her approach \u2013 associating so closely with the animals she studied, naming them and even referring to them as \u201cmy friends\u201d was scoffed at by some (mostly male) scientists.",
      "Her supervisor and mentor, Professor Louis Leakey, though, saw the value in her technique: \u201cHe wanted somebody whose mind wasn't messed up by the reductionist attitude of science to animals,\u201d Dr Goodall explains.",
      "\u201cYou don't have a dog, a cat, a rabbit, a horse and not give them a name. It's the same as when I studied squirrels in my garden as a little girl - they all had names.\u201d",
      "Her methods \u2013 and her sense of closeness to the primates she has dedicated her life to \u2013 have given her a unique perspective.",
      "She tells me about a \u201cwonderful moment\u201d with a chimpanzee she named David Greybeard, the male chimp who she first witnessed making and using tools to catch termites. \u201cHe was the first to lose his fear of me,\u201d she recalls.",
      "\u201cI sat down near him and, lying on the ground, was the ripe red fruit of an oil palm. I held it out towards him and he turned his head away. Then I put my hand closer and he turned and looked into my eyes, reached out and very gently squeezed my fingers.",
      "\u201cThat is how chimpanzees reassure each other. We understood each other perfectly - with a gestural language that obviously predates human speech.\u201d",
      "\u2018We need to get tougher\u2019",
      "Dr Goodall\u2019s career has often been challenging. She has written about the early years of her work for Professor Leakey, who was a renowned scientist, and who had enormous influence over her career. He repeatedly declared his love for her, putting pressure on her in a way that, today, might be viewed as sexual harassment.",
      "But she spurned his advances and kept her focus on her work and her beloved chimpanzees. Now, having turned 90 this year, she does not appear to be slowing down.",
      "So what keeps Dr Goodall going? On this she is emphatic \u2013 charmingly affronted by the question: \"Surely people want a future for their children. If they do, we have to get tougher about [environmental] legislation.",

      "It is an alternative platform to Elon Musk's X and in terms of its colour and logo, it looks quite similar.",
      "Bluesky is growing rapidly and is currently picking up around one million new sign-ups a day.",
      "It had 16.7m users at the time of writing, but that figure will likely be outdated by the time you read this.",
      "So what is it - and why are so many people joining?",
      "What is Bluesky?",
      "Bluesky describes itself as \"social media as it should be\", although it looks similar to other sites.",
      "Visually, a bar to the left of the page shows everything you might expect - search, notifications, a homepage and so on.",
      "People using the platform can post, comment, repost and like their favourite things.",
      "To put it simply, it looks how X, formerly known as Twitter, used to look.",
      "The main difference is Bluesky is decentralised - a complicated term which basically means users can host their data on servers other than those owned by the company.",
      "This means that rather than being limited to having a specific account named after Bluesky, people can (if they like) sign up using an account they themselves own.",
      "But it is worth stating that the vast majority of people don't do that and a new joiner will most likely have a \".bsky.social\" at the end of their username.",
      "Who owns Bluesky?",
      "If you think it feels a lot like X, you won't be surprised to learn why. The former head of Twitter, Jack Dorsey, created it.",
      "He even once said he wanted Bluesky to be a decentralised version of Twitter that no single person or entity owns.",
      "But Mr Dorsey is no longer part of the team behind it, having stepped down from the board in May 2024.",
      "He deleted his account altogether in September.",
      "It is now run and predominantly owned by chief executive Jay Graber as a US public benefit corporation.",
      "Why is it gaining in popularity?",
      "Bluesky has been around since 2019, but it was invitation-only until February of this year.",
      "That let the developers deal with all the kinks behind-the-scenes, to try and stabilise it before opening the doors to the wider public.",
      "The plan has worked, somewhat. But the flurry of new users has been so significant in November that there continue to be issues with outages.",
      "It is no coincidence that the number of new Bluesky users spiked following Donald Trump's success in the US elections in November.",
      "X's owner, Mr Musk, was a big backer of Trump during his campaign, and will be heavily involved in his administration.",
      "Inevitably, this has led to a political division, with some people leaving X in protest.",
      "But others have cited different reasons, such as the Guardian newspaper which has chosen to stop posting there as it called X \"a toxic media platform\".",
      "Meanwhile, Bluesky's app continues to pick up significant downloads worldwide and on Thursday was the top free app in the Apple App Store in the UK.",
      "Several celebrities, from pop singer Lizzo to Taskmaster's Greg Davies, have announced they are joining the platform and limiting their use of - or in some cases leaving altogether - X.",
      "Other names you might recognise include Ben Stiller, Jamie Lee Curtis and Patton Oswalt.",
      "But this growth, while significant, will have to continue for a long time before Bluesky is able to mount a true challenge to its microblogging rival.",
      "X does not share its total user numbers but it is understood to be measured in the hundreds of millions, with Elon Musk previously saying the platform had 250 million users each day.",
      "How does Bluesky make money?",
      "It is the million dollar question, quite literally.",
      "Bluesky started off with funding from investors and venture capital firms and has raised tens of millions of dollars through these means.",
      "But with so many new users, it is going to have to find a way to pay the bills.",
      "Back in Twitter's heyday, the site made the vast majority of its money through advertising.",
      "Bluesky has said it wants to avoid this. Instead, it said it will continue to look into paid services, such as having people pay for custom domains in their username.",
      "That sounds complicated but it basically comes down to a person's username being even more personalised.",
      "For example, it may mean my username - @twgerken.bsky.social - could in the future be more official-sounding, such as @twgerken.bbc.co.uk.",
      "Proponents of this idea say it doubles-up as a form of verification as the organisation which owns the website would have to clear its use.",
      "If Bluesky's owners continue to avoid advertising, they may inevitably have to look to other broader options, such as subscription features, as a way of keeping the lights on.",
      "But if it is not making very much money, that would not be unusual for tech startups.",
      "In fact, Twitter, before it was purchased by Mr Musk in 2022, only made a profit twice in its eight years of being publicly traded.",
      "And we all know how that ended - a massive payday for investors when the world's richest man paid $44bn (\u00a334.7bn) for the privilege of owning it.",
      "For now, the future of Bluesky remains unknown, but if its growth continues, anything is possible.",

      "It said in a blog post on its website that the billionaire had at one point wanted \"absolute control\" of the company.",

      "It never happened. Instead the company ran demonstration flights.",
      "While missing that deadline was embarrassing, behind the scenes a more serious issue was playing out - Volocopter was urgently trying to raise fresh investment to keep the firm going.",
      "Talks to borrow \u20ac100m (\u00a383m; $106m) from the government failed in April.",
      "Now hopes are pinned on China's Geely, which is in talks to take an 85% stake in Volocopter in return for $95m of funding, according to a Bloomberg report. The deal could mean that any future manufacturing would be moved to China.",
      "Volocopter is one of dozens of companies around the world developing an electric vertical take-off and landing (EVTOL) aircraft.",
      "Their machines promise the flexibility of a helicopter, but without the cost, noise and emissions.",
      "However, faced with the massive cost of getting such novel aircraft approved by regulators and then building up manufacturing capabilities, some investors are bailing out.",
      "One of the most high-profile casualties is Lilium.",
      "The German company had developed a radical take on the EVTOL theme.",
      "Lilium's aircraft uses 30 electric jets that can be tilted in unison to swing between vertical lift and forward flight.",
      "The concept proved attractive, with the company claiming to have orders and memoranda of understanding for 780 jets from around the world.",
      "It was able to demonstrate the technology using a remote controlled scale model. Construction had begun on the first full-sized jets, and testing had been due to begin in early 2025.",
      "As recently as the Farnborough Airshow in July, Lilium\u2019s COO Sebastian Borel was sounding confident.",
      "\u201cWe are definitely burning through cash,\" he told the BBC. \u201cBut this is a good sign, because it means we are producing the aircraft. We\u2019re going to have three aircraft in production by the end of the year, and we have also raised \u20ac1.5bn\u201d.",
      "But then the money ran out.",
      "Lilium had been attempting to arrange a loan worth \u20ac100m from the German development bank, KfW. However, that required guarantees from national and state governments, which never materialised.",
      "In early November, the company put its main operating businesses into insolvency proceedings, and its shares were removed from the Nasdaq stock exchange.",
      "For the moment, work on the new aircraft is continuing, as the company works with restructuring experts to sell the business or bring in new investment. However, getting the new e-jet into production is looking more challenging than ever.",
      "The high-profile British player in the eVTOL market is Vertical Aerospace. The Bristol-based company was founded in 2016 by businessman Stephen Fitzpatrick, who also set up OVO Energy.",
      "Its striking VX4 design uses eight large propellers mounted on slim, aircraft style wings to generate lift. Mr Fitzpatrick has made ambitious claims about the aircraft, suggesting it would be \u201c100 times\u201d safer and quieter than a helicopter, for 20% of the cost.",
      "The company has made progress. After completing a programme of remote-controlled testing, it began carrying out piloted tests earlier this year. Initially, these were carried out with the aircraft tethered to the ground. In early November, it carried out its first untethered take-off and landing.",
      "But there have also been serious setbacks. In August last year, a remotely-piloted prototype was badly damaged when it crashed during testing at Cotswold Airport, after a propeller blade fell off.",
      "In May one of its key partners, the engineering giant Rolls Royce pulled out of a deal to supply electric motors for the aircraft.",
      "Ambitions remain sky high. Vertical Aerospace says it will deliver 150 aircraft to its customers by the end of the decade. By then, it also expects to be capable of producing 200 units a year, and to be breaking even in cash terms.",
      "Yet financial strains have been intensifying. Mr Fitzpatrick invested an extra $25m into the company in March. But a further $25m, due in August if alternative investment could not be found, has not been paid. As of September, Vertical had $57.4m on hand \u2013 but it expects to burn through nearly double that over the coming year.",
      "Hopes for the future appear to be pinned on doing a deal with the American financier Jason Mudrick, who is already a major creditor through his firm Mudrick Capital Management.",
      "He has offered to invest $75m into the business \u2013 and has warned the board of Vertical that rejecting his plan would inevitably lead to insolvency proceedings. But the move has been resisted by Mr Fitzpatrick, who would lose control of the company he founded.",
      "Sources close to the talks insist an agreement is now very close. The company believes if a deal can be done, it will unlock further fundraising opportunities.",
      "Amid the turbulence, one European project is quietly on track, says Bjorn Fehrm who has a background in aeronautical engineering and piloted combat jets for the Swedish Air Force. He now works for aerospace consultancy Leeham.",
      "He says that the EVTOL project underway at Airbus is likely to survive.",
      "Called the CityAirbus NextGen, the four-seater aircraft has eight propellers and a range of 80km.",
      "\"This is a technology project for their engineers, and they've got the money, and they've got the know how,\" says Mr Fehrm.",
      "Elsewhere in the world, other well funded start-ups stand a good change of getting their aircraft into production. That would include Joby and Archer in the US.",
      "Once the aircraft are being produced, the next challenge will be to see if there's a profitable market for them.",
      "The first routes are likely to be between airports and city centres. But will they make money?",
      "\"The biggest problem area when it comes to the cost of operation is the pilot and the batteries. You need to change the batteries a couple of times per year,\" points out Mr Fehrm.",

    "published": "Thu, 21 Nov 2024 03:47:53 GMT",
    "summary": "Moscow appears to be maximising its gains while Joe Biden abandons long-held red lines at the end of his presidency.",
    "story": [
      "In a matter of days US President Joe Biden's administration and Russia have made separate - but significant - moves aimed at influencing the outcome of the war in Ukraine, two months ahead of Donald Trump\u2019s return to the White House.",
      "There is a sense of Moscow maximising its gains and of Biden abandoning long-held red lines before Trump seeks to deliver on his claim to end the war in 24 hours.",
      "Ukraine has already acted on Biden\u2019s decision to let Kyiv fire first long-range Atacms missiles deep into Russian territory. As Kyiv struggles to hold on to its territory in the east, Biden has promised to send anti-personnel landmines too as part of new military assistance worth nearly $300m (\u00a3239m).",
      "What prompted Biden\u2019s change of heart appears to have been the arrival of thousands of North Koreans deployed to the front line, which the US sees as a \u201cmassive escalation\u201d.",
      "But Russia's President Vladimir Putin has ratcheted up the tension still further by loosening the conditions of use for Russia\u2019s nuclear weapons. That \u201ceffectively eliminates\u201d defeat on the battlefield, claims Moscow.",
      "One Russia commentator suggested Putin might view the current situation as an \u201cin-between\u201d moment that gives him the sense he has the upper hand in Ukraine.",
      "At the start of this week, Russia launched its biggest aerial attack on Ukraine for almost three months. Amid fears of a renewed strike on Wednesday, several Western embassies closed their doors.",
      "\"It\u2019s all connected,\" says Mykhaylo Samus, head of the New Geopolitics Research Network in Ukraine. He argues Russia has been stockpiling hundreds of Iskander and Kinzhal missiles for weeks to enable it to carry out strikes and thus send a psychological message ahead of the transfer of power in Washington DC.",
      "Ukraine's capital, Kyiv, may have been spared on Wednesday, but the message got through.",
      "\u201cEverything is about preparing for a strong position for talks with Trump, to understand Russia is not going to make compromise and everything depends on [Ukraine's President Volodymyr] Zelensky.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s clearly an effort ahead of Trump to maximise their standings,\u201d agrees Jade McGlynn, from the war studies department at King\u2019s College London. She is highly sceptical that a deal with Putin is possible - and that ultimately his aim is to subjugate Russia\u2019s south-western neighbour.",
      "Biden agrees to give Ukraine anti-personnel mines",
      "Ukraine front could 'collapse' as Russia gains accelerate, experts warn",
      "Ukraine marked 1,000 days since Russia's full-scale invasion on Tuesday with Russian forces waging relentless attacks in a bid to seize key hubs in the east of Ukraine.",
      "The mood in Moscow appears to be that it is only a matter of time before Ukraine is in its hands, says Tatiana Stanovaya of the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center.",
      "From January, however, Putin will have to consider other factors, she says: \u201cHe will have to deal with the fact that Trump now is responsible for the situation. If Putin escalates, it can worsen the chances for a deal. He will have to be more flexible, more open to different options.\u201d",
      "The Biden administration announced new military assistance for Ukraine to include ammunition, missiles and drones, as well as anti-personnel landmines.",
      "The US leader's decision to allow Kyiv to begin firing Atacms into Russian territory was clearly directed at helping Kyiv, but it was felt by the Trump entourage, too.",
      "Although Trump has so far said nothing, his pick for National Security Advisor, Mike Waltz, spoke of \u201canother step up the escalation ladder and nobody knows where this is going\u201d.",
      "He did not go as far as some on the Trump team. Donald Trump Jr complained Biden was trying to \u201cget World War Three\u201d going before his father could even return to the White House.",
      "\"There's one president at a time,\" said state department spokesman Matthew Miller \"When the next president takes office, he can make his own decisions.\u201d",
      "Some Republicans have backed Biden\u2019s move, although Sen Lindsay Graham said he should have done it \u201cto help Ukraine and he\u2019s playing politics with it\u201d.",
      "Russia\u2019s reaction may or may not be an empty threat.",
      "Under its revised nuclear doctrine, Moscow will now be able to use nuclear weapons against non-nuclear countries that are backed by nuclear powers, and if it comes under \u201cmassive\u201d air attack, too.",
      "Alexander Yermakov from the Russian International Affairs Council says the change is not so much as an operational manual for using nuclear weapons, but \u201cprimarily it serves as a declaration to potential adversaries, outlining the scenarios in which such measures could be considered\u201d.",
      "Another message from Putin to the West, then.",
      "Atacms: What we know about missile system Ukraine has used to strike Russia",
      "Fury in Russia at 'serious escalation' of missile move",
      "Tatiana Stanovaya believes it is not that he wants to start World War Three, but because \u201che believes he must scare the Western elites to show they are playing with fire\u201d.",
      "What happens beyond January is anyone's guess.",
      "Kremlin insiders have already begun briefing about their minimal demands from any Trump initiative to end the war, and Volodymyr Zelensky has begun making his position clear too.",
      "Asked in a US TV interview what would happen to Ukraine if Washington slashed military aid, he was clear: \"If they will cut, I think we will lose. Of course, anyway, we will stay and we will fight. We have production, but it\u2019s not enough to prevail.\"",
      "Putin insists Ukraine will have to remain neutral for any relations to work, even though it is now part of Ukraine\u2019s constitution to join both Nato and the European Union.",
      "A Reuters news agency report on Wednesday cited Russian officials saying Putin might be open to pulling out from relatively small patches of territory but nothing bigger.",
      "Zelensky on Tuesday presented his 10-point \u201cresilience plan\u201d to parliament, and one defiant message rang out in the Verkhovna Rada more than most.",
      "\u201cMaybe Ukraine will have to outlive someone in Moscow in order to achieve all its goals... to restore the full integrity of Ukraine.\u201d",
      "One day Russia would be without Putin, in other words, but Ukraine would be going nowhere.",
      "For Ukrainians that wait could take years, says Mykhaylo Samus, but they would never consent to abandoning Crimea or any other territory under Russian occupation.",
      "The most Zelensky might be prepared to sign would be a ceasefire without commitments, he believes. Anything else would lead to internal conflict as many would view it as a betrayal.",
      "Ahead of any talks Mykola Bielieskov of the National Institute for Strategic Studies in Kyiv believes the key is to prevent any major Russian breakthrough in the east.",
      "\u201cFor us it\u2019s just necessary to localise [Russian] advances\u2026  using Atacms, anti-personnel landmines or whatever. Because if the Russians are successful they would try to dictate terms.\u201d",
      "Speaking to the BBC from Kharkiv, Jade McGlynn said few Ukrainians believed Trump would be able to engineer any kind of lasting peace deal.",
      "Any kind of settlement that left Ukraine in a much worse position would lead to political chaos, she said.",
      "\u201cEurope needs to step up,\u201d she said, \u201cand ultimately we know that the Scandinavians, Baltic states and Poland are not enough.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "\u201cI felt really scared to be honest,\u201d says James, describing an incident on Snapchat that left him questioning whether it was safe to go to school.",
      "The Australian boy, 12, had had a disagreement with a friend, and one night before bed the boy added him to a group chat with two older teenagers.",

      "James - not his real name - first joined Snapchat when he was 10, after a classmate suggested everyone in their friendship group get the app. But after telling his parents about his cyberbullying experience, which was ultimately resolved by his school, James deleted his account.",
      "His experience is a cautionary tale that shows why the Australian government\u2019s proposed social media ban on children under 16 is necessary, says his mother Emma, who is also using a pseudonym.",
      "The laws, which were tabled in parliament's lower house on Thursday, have been billed by Prime Minister Anthony Albanese as \u201cworld-leading\u201d.",
      "But while many parents have applauded the move, some experts have questioned whether kids should - or even can - be barred from accessing social media, and what the adverse effects of doing so may be.",
      "What is Australia proposing?",
      "Albanese says the ban - which will cover platforms such as X, TikTok, Facebook and Instagram - is about protecting kids from the \u201charms\u201d of social media.",
      "\"This is a global problem and we want young Australians essentially to have a childhood. We want parents to have peace of mind,\" he said on Thursday.",
      "The new legislation provides a \"framework\" for the ban. But the 17-page document, which is expected to head to the Senate next week, is sparse on detail.",
      "Instead, it will be up to the nation\u2019s internet regulator - the eSafety Commissioner - to hash out how to implement and enforce the rules, which will not come into effect for at least 12 months after legislation is passed.",
      "According to the bill, the ban will apply to all children under 16 and that there will be no exemptions for existing users or those with parental consent.",
      "Tech companies will face penalties of up to A$50m ($32.5m; \u00a325.7) if they do not comply, but there will be exemptions for platforms which are able to create \u201clow-risk services\" deemed suitable for kids. Criteria for this threshold are yet to be set.",
      "Messaging services and gaming sites, however, will not be restricted, as will some sites that can be accessed without an account like YouTube, which has prompted questions over how regulators will determine what is and isn\u2019t a social media platform in a fast-moving landscape.",
      "A group representing the interests of tech companies such as Meta, Snapchat and X in Australia has dismissed the ban as \u201ca 20th Century response to 21st Century challenges\u201d.",
      "Such legislation could push kids into \u201cdangerous, unregulated parts of the internet\u201d, Digital Industry Group Inc says - a fear also expressed by some experts.",

      "\u201cIt will always be fluid, and this is why regulators like eSafety have to be nimble,\u201d she told BBC Radio 5 Live.",
      "But Ms Inman Grant has also raised concerns about the central idea behind the government\u2019s policy, which is that there\u2019s a causal link between social media and declining mental health.",
      "\u201cI would say that the evidence base is not settled at all,\u201d she said, pointing to research from her own office which found that some of the most vulnerable groups, such as LGBTQ+ or First Nations teenagers, \u201cfeel more themselves online than they do in the real world\u201d.",
      "This is a sentiment echoed by Lucas Lane, 15, who runs an online business selling nail polish to boys. \u201cThis [ban] destroys\u2026 my friendships and the ability to make people feel seen,\u201d the Perth teenager tells the BBC.",
      "Ms Inman Grant would rather see tech companies clean up their platforms, as well as more investment in education tools to help young people stay safe online. She uses the analogy of teaching children to swim, rather than banning them from the water.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t fence the ocean\u2026 but we do create protected swimming environments that provide safeguards and teach important lessons from a young age,\u201d she told parliament earlier this year.",

      "\u201cShould we really be wasting our time trying to help kids navigate these difficult systems when tech companies just want them on them all the time?\" she says.",

      "Amy Friedlander, a mother of three from the Wait Mate movement - which encourages parents to delay giving their kids smartphones - agrees.",
      "\u201cWe can\u2019t ignore all the positives that technology has brought into our lives. There are huge upsides, but what we haven\u2019t really considered is the impact it is having on brains which aren\u2019t ready for it.\u201d",
      "'Too blunt an instrument'",
      "Over 100 Australian academics have criticised the ban as \"too blunt an instrument\" and argued that it goes against UN advice which calls on governments to ensure young people have \u201csafe access\u201d to digital environments.",
      "It has also failed to win the backing of a bipartisan parliamentary committee that\u2019s been examining the impact of social media on adolescents. Instead, the committee recommended that tech giants face tougher regulations.",
      "To address some of those concerns, the government says it will eventually introduce \"digital duty of care\" laws, which will make it a legal obligation for tech companies to prioritise user safety.",
      "Joanne Orlando, a researcher in digital behaviour, argues that while a ban \u201ccould be part of a strategy, it absolutely can\u2019t be the whole strategy\u201d.",
      "She says \u201cthe biggest piece of the puzzle\u201d should be educating kids to think critically about the content they see on their feeds and how they use social media.",
      "The government has already spent A$6m since 2022 to develop free \u201cdigital literacy tools\u201d to try and do just that. However, research suggests that many young Australians aren\u2019t receiving regular lessons.",
      "Ms Orlando and other experts warn there are also significant hurdles to making the age-verification technology - which is required to enforce the ban - effective and safe, given the \u201cenormous risks\u201d associated with potentially housing the identification documents of every Australian online.",
      "The government has said it is aiming to solve that challenge through age-verification trials, and hopes to table a report by mid-next year. It has promised that privacy concerns will be front and centre, but offered little detail on what kind of technology will actually be tested.",
      "In its advice, the eSafety Commissioner has floated the idea of using a third-party service to anonymise a user\u2019s ID before it is passed on to any age verification sites, to \u201cpreserve\u201d their privacy.",
      "However, Ms Orlando remains sceptical. \u201cI can\u2019t think of any technology that exists at this point that can pull this off,\u201d she tells the BBC.",
      "Will Australia succeed?",
      "Australia is by no means the first country to try to restrict how young people access certain websites or platforms online.",
      "In 2011, South Korea passed its \u201cshutdown law\u201d which prevented children under 16 from playing internet games between 22:30 and 6:00, but the rules - which faced backlash - were later scrapped citing the need to \u201crespect the rights of youths\u201d.",
      "More recently France introduced legislation requiring social media platforms to block access to children under 15 without parental consent. Research indicated almost half of users were able to circumvent the ban using a simple VPN.",
      "A law in the US state of Utah - which was similar to Australia\u2019s - ran into a different issue: it was blocked by a federal judge who found it unconstitutional.",
      "Albanese has conceded that Australia's proposal may not be foolproof, and if it passes the parliament, it would be subject to a review.",
      "\"We all know technology moves fast and some people will try to find ways around these new laws but that is not a reason to ignore the responsibility that we have,\" he told lawmakers.",
      "But for parents like Emma and Ms Friedlander - who have lobbied for the changes - it's the message that the ban sends which matters most.",
      "\u201cFor too long parents have had this impossible choice between giving in and getting their child an addictive device or seeing their child isolated and feeling left out socially,\u201d Ms Friedlander says.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve been trapped in a norm that no one wants to be a part of.\u201d",
      "James says that since quitting Snapchat he\u2019s found himself spending more time outside with friends.",
      "And he hopes that the new laws could enable more kids like him to \u201cget out and do the things they love\u201d instead of feeling pressured to be online."

    "summary": "The allegations of bribery and fraud are the latest blow for the tycoon, one of India's richest people.",
    "story": [
      "Indian billionaire Gautam Adani has been charged with fraud in the US, which has accused him of orchestrating a $250m (\u00a3198m) bribery scheme and concealing it to raise money in the US.",
      "The criminal charges, filed on Wednesday in New York, are the latest blow to 62-year-old Mr Adani, one of India's richest men, whose business empire extends from ports and airports to renewable energy.",
      "In the indictment, prosecutors alleged the tycoon and other senior executives had agreed to the payments to Indian officials to win contracts for his renewable energy company expected to yield more than $2bn in profits over 20 years.",
      "The Adani Group did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Shares of Adani Group firms fell more than 10% in Thursday morning trade, with the group losing around $30bn in market capitalisation. Adani Green Energy, which is the firm at the centre of the allegations, also said it wouldn't proceed with a $600m bond offering.",
      "The conglomerate has been operating under a cloud in the US since 2023, when a high-profile company published a report accusing it of fraud. The claims, which Mr Adani denied, prompted a major market sell-off.",
      "Reports of this bribery probe have been circling for months. Prosecutors said the US started investigating the company in 2022, and found the inquiry obstructed.",
      "They allege that executives raised $3bn in loans and bonds, including from US firms, on the backs of false and misleading statements related to the firm's anti-bribery practices and policies, as well as reports of the bribery probe.",
      "\u201cAs alleged, the defendants orchestrated an elaborate scheme to bribe Indian government officials to secure contracts worth billions of dollars and... lied about the bribery scheme as they sought to raise capital from U.S. and international investors,\u201d US Attorney Breon Peace said in a statement announcing the charges.",
      "\u201cMy office is committed to rooting out corruption in the international marketplace and protecting investors from those who seek to enrich themselves at the expense of the integrity of our financial markets,\u201d he added.",
      "On several occasions Mr Adani met personally with government officials to advance the bribery scheme, officials said.",
      "Michael Kugelman, director of the South Asia Institute at the Wilson Center, called the charges a \"body blow\" to the tycoon.",
      "\"For the last nearly two years, Mr Adani has been trying to rehabilitate his image, and [trying] to show that those earlier fraud allegations levelled by the Hindenburg group were not true, and his company and his businesses had actually been doing quite well,\" he told the BBC's Business Today programme.",
      "But it might be harder for the billionaire, he said, to \"shake off\" the allegations made by the US Department of Justice.",
      "Mr Adani is a close ally of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. He has long faced claims from opposition politicians alleging that he has benefited from his political ties, which he denies.",
      "The US Attorney positions in the US are appointed by the president. The filing comes just weeks after Donald Trump won election to the White House, pledging to overhaul the US Justice Department.",
      "Last week on social media, Mr Adani congratulated Trump on his election win and pledged to invest $10bn in the US."

    "summary": "The president-elect has repeatedly pledged to deport millions of undocumented migrants once in office.",
    "story": [
      "Texas authorities say they are prepared to offer President-elect Donald Trump 1,400-acres (567 hectares) of land along the US-Mexico border to build detention facilities for undocumented migrants.",
      "In a letter, the Texas General Land Office said the plot could be used to build facilities for \"processing, detention, and co-ordination of the largest deportation of violent criminals in the nation's history\".",
      "Trump has repeatedly pledged to deport millions of undocumented migrants and mobilise the National Guard to help carry this out.",
      "His plan, however, is likely to face enormous financial and logistics hurdles, as well as immediate legal challenges from rights groups.",
      "The letter, published online and sent to Trump at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida, notes that the owner of the recently purchased land had refused to allow a border wall to be built there and \"actively blocked law enforcement\" from accessing it.",
      "\"Now it's essentially farmland, so it's flat, it's easy to build on. We can very easily put a detention centre on there,\" Texas Land Commissioner Dawn Buckingham said in an interview with Fox News, which first reported the offer.",
      "The state government in Texas, which launched its own unilateral border security operation after Trump left office, has been broadly supportive of Trump's promises to strengthen the US-Mexico border.",
      "Buckingham said she was \"100% on board with the Trump administration's pledge to get these criminals out of our country\".",
      "But the Democratic governors of three other southern border states - California, Arizona, and New Mexico - have said they will not aid mass deportations.",
      "\u201cLocal and state officials on the frontlines of the Harris-Biden border invasion have been suffering for four years and are eager for President Trump to return to the Oval Office,\" Trump transition spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said in a statement.",
      "\"President Trump will marshal every lever of power to secure the border, protect their communities, and launch the largest mass deportation operation of illegal immigrant criminals in history.\u201d",
      "What any new detention facilities would look like is unclear, although the incoming \"border czar\" Tom Homan has suggested they could be \"soft-sided\".",
      "Facilities currently in use range from soft-sided, camp-like facilities used by Customs and Border Patrol to house undocumented migrants for short periods of time, as well as brick-and-mortar buildings used by Immigrations and Customs Enforcement, or ICE.",
      "County and state jails are also used, for which local jurisdictions receive compensation from immigration authorities.",
      "Stephen Miller, the top Trump adviser on immigration who has been picked as deputy chief of staff for policy, has previously said the Trump administration would build vast holding facilities to serve as staging centres for mass deportations.",
      "In a late 2023 interview with the New York Times, Miller said that the facilities would likely be built on open land near Texas' border with Mexico.",
      "A 2024 spending bill signed by President Joe Biden allocated $3.4m (\u00a32.69m) for ICE to house as many as 41,500 on any given day.",
      "\"If Trump conducts mass deportations, ICE would blow past that number very quickly,\" Adam Isacson, a migration and border expert from the Washington Office on Latin America told the BBC.",
      "ICE data compiled by the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse at Syracuse University found that there were 38,863 immigrant detainees being held as of 2 November.",
      "The largest number - just over 12,000 - are held at facilities located in Texas.",
      "News of Texas' offer to the president-elect comes as Democratic-run cities and states have vowed to not co-operate with Trump's promises of mass deportations.",
      "On Tuesday, for example, Los Angeles' city council passed a \"sanctuary city\" ordinance to bar using local resources to help federal immigration authorities.",
      "Kathleen Bush-Joseph, a policy analyst at the Washington-based Migration Policy Institute, said that the fact that Republican-led states are more likely to co-operate with the Trump administration's immigration goals could create a \"patchwork of protections\" that differ widely across the country.",
      "\"We might see the divide between red and blue states widen,\" she said.",
      "Ms Bush-Joseph added that additional facilities in Texas could also mean that undocumented migrants detained in the US interior could ultimately be moved and processed there.",
      "\"If you're picking up people in blue states, and they don't have detention facilities available, then do you try to move them to red states?\" she asked. \"That's the question.\"\""

      "Australia's debate over capping foreign student numbers is \u201cnot over\u201d despite a controversial bill unexpectedly losing support, a top industry body says.",
      "The bill, part of efforts to slash overall migration to Australia, had been opposed by most universities who say it would damage the higher education sector and its global reputation.",
      "The government argued the legislation was needed to make the industry more sustainable and ease pressure on housing, and it was expected to easily pass with opposition support this week.",
      "However in a surprise eleventh-hour move, Australia's opposition leader said his coalition would vote against the bill as it didn't go far enough.",
      "Though some universities have expressed support at the bill's apparent demise, they also say it extends the uncertainty surrounding the industry - which is worth about A$50bn (\u00a325.7bn, $32.7bn) to the economy.",
      "Luke Sheehy, head of Universities Australia, told the BBC the news brought \"no sense of relief\" for him.",
      "\"I just knew that we would be looking at international students [used] as cannon fodder in a phoney war on migration right through to the election now,\" said Mr Sheehy, whose organisation advocates for 39 universities.",
      "The cap proposed limiting new enrolments at 270,000 for 2025 - a significant cut on the number in 2024. It had been due to come into effect in just six weeks.",
      "Some universities have made job cuts and rejected student applications in anticipation of the new laws, and the BBC was told foreign students were already choosing to study elsewhere as a result of the reduced confidence in the sector.",
      "The legislation, currently before the Senate, has not been formally withdrawn by Prime Minister Anthony Albanese's Labor government but it cannot pass without the support of the main opposition Liberal-National coalition or the Greens, who also oppose it.",
      "Leader of the Opposition Peter Dutton called the bill \"a dog's breakfast\" and vowed to introduce \"deeper cuts\" if he wins the upcoming election, due by May.",
      "The Greens, on the other hand, described the bill \"dog whistling that shamefully scapegoated international students for the housing crisis they did not cause\".",
      "The government has accused Mr Dutton of hypocrisy, arguing he has often talked \"tough\" on cutting immigration to the country, which has reached record levels in recent years.",
      "The expected failure of the bill would mean an existing visa policy, which has been widely accused of exacerbating problems by funnelling most international students to a select few city-based universities, will remain in place.",
      "The Group of Eight (Go8) - a body which represents Australia\u2019s top ranked universities - said the bill would have hurt students and staff and that common sense had prevailed.",
      "But the industry has been left scrambling again, with only a few months left until the 2025 academic year begins. Observers say some universities could now receive a spike in students when they had a expected a cut, and others - predominantly in regional locations - will no longer expect as many, putting them under greater financial pressure.",
      "\"The most devastating part of this discussion is that we still don't have a resolution,\" Mr Sheehy said.",
      "\"We're nowhere closer to providing the certainty, stability and growth the government promised us all those many months ago when they proposed caps.\""

      "The movie\u2019s star Alec Baldwin was not invited and did not attend the premiere.",
      "Writer and director Joel Souza, who was wounded in the shooting, told the BBC at the premiere that at one point he \"couldn\u2019t even conceive of ever being back on the set ever again, it just hurt too much\".",
      "He said he changed his mind and decided to complete the film after speaking to Hutchins' husband, Matt.",
      "But the announcement that Camerimage in the northern Polish city of Torun was going to give the movie its international debut has been criticised by some prominent cinematographers in Hollywood for being disrespectful to Hutchins' memory.",

      "In a statement issued by her lawyer she said she regards the premiere as an attempt to profit from her daughter\u2019s death.",

      "\"At first I didn\u2019t really know if I wanted to do this to be honest, but as I found out that this is what Matt wanted, this is what the family wanted, it started to change the equation for me,\" he told the BBC.",
      "\"It was going to be more about honouring her legacy and her memory, saying that her final work was completed and that began to change my mind on things,\" he added.",
      "Both he and Cline acknowledged that many in the industry were uncomfortable with his decision.",

Some people think it\u2019s better to deal with that through not participating and other people think it\u2019s honourable like we do. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any right or wrong answer to this,\u201d Cline told the BBC.",
      "Before the screening, Rachel Mason, a close friend of Hutchins who filmed a documentary about the making of Rust, recalled how difficult it was to complete the movie with all the controversy surrounding it.",
      "She said some crew members told her not to film them on the closed set, in case, she said, it was discovered they had worked on Rust \"and I might never get a job again\".",
      "Crew came back to finish the filming after they realised it might help Hutchins' family.",
      "\"She had this amazing gift of becoming friends very, very fast with people. And they all fell in love with her,\" she said.",
      "Ms Mason also recounted a conversation with Hutchins' mother 18 months ago during which she told her she wanted the film to be completed because it was her daughter\u2019s \"big work\".",
      "Rust depicts the manhunt for grandfather and grandson amidst a backdrop of snow-capped mountains and tumbleweed dirt towns.",
      "It knowingly acknowledges classic westerns including John Ford\u2019s \u2018The Searchers\u2019 and Sergio Leone\u2019s \u2018The Good, the Bad and the Ugly\u2019.",
      "Souza was very close to his own grandfather, who, he said, loved westerns.",

      "One viewer noted the many gunfight scenes involving Alec Baldwin could be distracting.",
      "\u201cAll the time as I was thinking about it, especially during the gunfight scenes, it was hard not to get pulled back out of the movie, especially when Alec Baldwin\u2019s holding a gun, but most of the time it was just a really, really enjoyable experience,\u201d Maciej from Torun said.",
      "In a statement, Melina Spadone, representative for Rust Movie Productions, defended the festival against some of the criticism.",
      "\"The Camerimage festival celebrates the artistry of cinematographers; it is not a festival for buyers.",
      "\"None of the producers of Rust stand to benefit financially from the film. The suggestion that those involved in completing Halyna Hutchins\u2019 film were motivated by profit is disrespectful to those who worked tirelessly to honor her legacy.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "Donald Trump has moved speedily since winning the US presidential election to set the foundations of his second term in the White House.",
      "He has made his early priorities clear - and stunned some in Washington and around the world while doing so.",
      "Here\u2019s what we\u2019ve learned from his rollercoaster first week as president-elect.",
      "1) He\u2019s building a loyal team to shake up government",
      "Trump started building his top team almost immediately, nominating cabinet picks for Senate approval and appointing White House advisers and other senior aides.",
      "But that doesn\u2019t tell the full story.",
      "His selections make clear that he plans a radical shake up of government, eschewing more conventional and experienced picks for those who are loyal to him and share his vision for a second term that will upend the status quo in Washington.",
      "His choice for defence secretary, for example, has called for a purge of military chiefs enacting \u201cwoke\u201d policies. His nominee for health secretary, Robert F Kennedy Jr, has said he wants to \u201cclear out corruption\u201d at America\u2019s health agencies and cut \u201centire departments\u201d at the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).",
      "And that\u2019s not to mention a promised \u201cDepartment of Government Efficiency\u201c helmed by advisers Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy, which Trump says will focus on slashing regulations and historic cost-cutting.",
      "The bigger picture is that Trump\u2019s proposed team is almost universally loyal, and favour overhauling their respective government departments.",
      "You can take a deeper look at who\u2019s in the frame for his top team here.",
      "2) He\u2019ll have a friendly Congress on his side",
      "Republicans have won control of the House as well as the Senate, giving the party a crucial (albeit narrow) majority in both chambers for at least the next two years, when there will be the usual midterm elections.",
      "This is a major boost to Trump\u2019s agenda. It means he will be more easily able to pass legislation and gives his policy priorities a friendly path to becoming law.",
      "The Democratic Party will, naturally, be less able to block and resist his agenda too. And Trump should for now be able to avoid the kind of congressional investigations he faced in the second half of his first term.",
      "Ultimately, Republican control of Congress could prove key in pushing through his big pledges such as mass deportations, sweeping tariffs on foreign imports and the rolling back of environmental protections.",
      "It won\u2019t always be smooth sailing for Trump in Congress, however, as our correspondent Gary O\u2019Donoghue explains here.",
      "3) But Senate Republicans won\u2019t always roll over",
      "Trump\u2019s influence was put to the test earlier this week when Republicans in the Senate picked their new leader.",
      "While he did not weigh-in on the race directly, there had been a concerted effort from the president-elect\u2019s most vocal allies as well as favourable \u2018Maga\u2019 media outlets to get hard-line Trump loyalist Rick Scott elected.",
      "But he was defeated in the first round and Republicans opted for a more orthodox pick in John Thune, who has had a more rocky relationship with Trump.",
      "It\u2019s worth noting that this was a secret ballot, so it was far from a public repudiation of Trumpworld.",
      "There will be sterner tests of Trump\u2019s power on Capitol Hill to come, notably when confirmation hearings are held for his more divisive cabinet picks.",
      "Some Senate Republicans, for example, have already signalled their opposition to Trump's shock choice of Matt Gaetz to lead the justice department.",
      "4) Trump's criminal conviction could soon be wiped",
      "While much of the focus was on the president-elect\u2019s nominations and appointments, we also had a reminder that his legal troubles have been upended by his victory.",
      "In New York specifically, his criminal fraud conviction in the hush-money case lives on for at least a few more days.",
      "But it could soon be consigned to history. Earlier this week a judge delayed his decision as to whether Trump\u2019s conviction should be thrown out because of a Supreme Court ruling in the summer that expanded presidential immunity.",
      "That decision is now expected to come next week. And while it\u2019s not clear whether the conviction will be tossed out, Trump\u2019s scheduled sentencing on 26 November is likely to be delayed regardless.",
      "Here\u2019s a reminder of how Trump\u2019s election win impacts his cases.",
      "What are recess appointments and how will Trump administration picks be vetted?",
      "Trump's pick of Huckabee and Witkoff a clue to Middle East policy",
      "Trump picking Gaetz to head justice sends shockwaves - and a strong message",
      "Who has joined Trump's team so far?",
      "5) He has China firmly in his sights",
      "It\u2019s no secret that Trump views the world differently to Biden, and could drastically shift US foreign policy over the next few years.",
      "One clear theme that's emerged in recent days is the prominence of China hawks in his proposed team - those who believe Beijing poses a serious threat to US economic and military dominance and want to challenge this more forcefully.",
      "And they are present from the top down.",
      "His nomination for secretary of state - America\u2019s most senior diplomat - Marco Rubio, has described China as the \u201cmost advanced adversary America has ever faced\u201d.",
      "Mike Waltz, his national security adviser, has said the US is in a \u201ccold war\u201d with China. Other nominees such as his proposed ambassador to the UN, Elise Stefanik, have directly accused China of election interference.",
      "During Trump\u2019s first administration, relations with Beijing were tense, and they barely warmed under Biden. With tariffs, export controls and pointed rhetoric, the president-elect appears ready to take an even tougher stance this time around."

    "summary": "Nominees can face a lengthy Senate vetting process before taking office, though Trump may try to upend that exercise in some cases.",
    "story": [
      "Donald Trump is facing opposition in some corners over key hires he has announced ahead of his return to the White House.",
      "Though some of the Republican president-elect's personnel decisions are immediate, many must go through further vetting.",
      "Several of the posts require a Senate hearing and a majority of the chamber's approval.",
      "But Trump is reportedly looking into a clause in the US Constitution that allows a president to unilaterally appoint nominees if the Senate is not in session.",
      "Senate vetting: How does it work?",
      "More than 1,000 positions - including the 15 officials chosen to lead executive departments, known as the Cabinet - typically require Senate approval. This also includes ambassadors and even some lower-level positions.",
      "But many members of Trump's team, including those who work in the White House or posts like the national security adviser, don't require Senate approval. They still are vetted, however, by the administration and could face intensive FBI background checks.",
      "On Thursday, incoming Senate Majority Leader John Thune on Fox News that he does not anticipate a smooth road for each nominee.",
      "'None of this is gonna be easy,' he said.",
      "The FBI says members who are subject to vetting include presidential appointees, White House staff, positions requiring Senate confirmation, and other national security positions requiring security clearance.",
      "The FBI says it \"does not adjudicate or render an opinion on the results of the background investigation\", which are then sent to the office of the president-elect or the office of White House Counsel for their use \"as deemed appropriate\".",
      "It also is responsible for focusing \"on character and conduct\" and completing its investigation \"as expeditiously as possible.\"",
      "But the president-elect\u2019s transition team is\u202fbypassing FBI background checks for some cabinet picks, according to anonymous sources, CNN reported. It also has considered turning to private vetting companies. BBC has not independently verified this.",

      "What Trump could do on day one in the White House",
      "What White House picks tell us about Trump 2.0",
      "The Senate approval process requires nominees to submit financial disclosure forms, fill out a questionnaire - which differs based on the role - and testify before a Senate committee.",
      "These hearings can sometimes be contentious. They allow members from both political parties to question nominees about their backgrounds and plans for the post.",
      "After the hearing, the committee votes on the nomination. If it approves the candidate, the full Senate then votes on the nominee.",
      "Historically, the upper chamber has approved cabinet positions quickly - sometimes with little or no debate. But \"political and partisan conflicts between the president and senators have at times produced dramatic fights over cabinet nominees and led to their ultimate withdrawal or rejection\", the Senate's historical website notes.",
      "Bitter political brawls over Trump's picks could be limited somewhat because Republicans will control both chambers of Congress when the president-elect takes office in January.",
      "But some Republicans already have questioned at least one Trump choice, Florida congressman Matt Gaetz, the nominee for post of attorney general, or top prosecutor in the US.",
      "What are recess appointments?",
      "The vetting and approval process for nominees can be lengthy, but it was included in the US Constitution to provide a check on presidential power. It is also designed to rule out corrupt or unqualified nominees.",
      "There is, however, an exception to this process - recess appointments - which Trump appears intent to use to ensure his appointments are able to take office.",
      "Basically, the process says that when Congress is in recess - meaning it's not in session for a duration of time - the president can make appointments temporarily without congressional approval or vetting.",
      "Sen Thune warned on Fox that while recess appointments are an option for nominees, it is also not a certainty. First, all senators would need to vote to recess, he said, adding that the same senators with concerns about a nominee might also oppose a recess.",
      "The recess process was created when Congress didn't meet as often as it does today, and was to be used in emergencies so presidents would be able to fill positions without delay.",
      "It is also supposed to be a temporary appointment and expires at the end of a congressional session - so at most, one year.",
      "Trump recently said the Senate \"must agree\" to recess appointments, otherwise \"we will not be able to get people confirmed in a timely manner\". He noted that in his past administration, some of his nominees took multiple years to be confirmed.",
      "Trump's plan to use recess appointments, along with the announcement that Republican senators' support bypassing the Senate vetting process, is not without precedent.",
      "Some past presidents have employed the method liberally, often as a way of circumventing political divides that would slow nominations.",
      "George W Bush made 171 recess appointments, Bill Clinton made 139 and Barack Obama made at least 32, according to the Congressional Research Service (CRS).",
      "This method of getting nominees into office was virtually stopped after the Supreme Court ruled against Obama in 2014, striking down multiple recess appointments and calling them unconstitutional.",

      "Trump has full control of government - but he won't always get his way",
      "Why is Elon Musk becoming Donald Trump's efficiency tsar?",
      "Josh Chafetz, a constitutional law professor at Georgetown University, says recess appointments are \"not meant to be a mechanism for circumventing Senate consent\".",
      "While other presidents have used them, Prof Chafetz says: \"I can't think of an instance in which the Senate majority has triggered a recess simply so that a president could make recess appointments.\"",
      "When can Trump make recess appointments?",
      "According to Professor Chafetz, there are two paths Trump could take to making recess appointments.",
      "The first would involve the Senate agreeing to recess for 10 days or more by majority vote.",
      "The second would involve the House voting for a longer recess than the Senate, which would allow Trump to invoke a never-used constitutional power to adjourn both chambers of Congress.",
      "According to the US Constitution, \"in Case of Disagreement\" a president can adjourn both chambers of Congress until \"such Time as he shall think proper\" - which would then provide Trump an opportunity to make recess appointments.",
      "Trump previously threatened to use this power when he was in the White House.",
      "In 2020, during a pandemic briefing, Trump said that he would \"exercise my constitutional authority to adjourn both chambers of Congress\u201d to make recess appointments if his nominees before Congress were not approved.",
      "Professor Chafetz stressed that this route has never been used before in US history, and so \"no-one is quite sure how it would work\".",
      "He added that Trump cannot make any recess appointments until he is president. His inauguration is scheduled for 20 January.",
      "If Trump wishes for the Senate to recess for a period longer than 10 days, he would require the unanimous consent of all 100 lawmakers.",
      "But the chamber includes 47 Democrats, all or most of whom will vote to block the change.",
      "In order to override that blockade, Republicans need a 60-vote majority, which means winning support from all 53 of their members and at least seven Democrats.",
      "With Republicans unlikely to reach that threshold, they will be faced with rolling back a procedural tool known as the filibuster. Incoming Senate Majority Leader John Thune, like his predecessor Mitch McConnell, has already indicated he does not support setting such a precedent.",

    "published": "Thu, 21 Nov 2024 07:24:35 GMT",
    "summary": "Illegal miners live dangerously, but make roaring profits selling gold on the black-market.",
    "story": [
      "Along with about 600 other men, Ndumiso lives and works in a small gang-controlled \"town\" - complete with markets and a red light district - that has grown up deep underground at a disused gold mine in South Africa.",
      "Ndumiso told the BBC that after being laid off by a big mining firm, he decided to join the gang in its underground world to become what is known as a \"zama zama\", an illegal miner.",
      "He digs for the precious metal and surfaces every three months or so to sell it on the black market for a huge profit, earning more than he ever did before - though the risks now are far higher.",
      "\"The underground life is ruthless. Many do not make it out alive,\" said the 52-year-old, who spoke to the BBC on condition that his real name was not used as he feared reprisals.",
      "\"In one level of the shaft there are bodies and skeletons. We call that the zama-zama graveyard,\" he said.",
      "But for those who survive, like Ndumiso, the job can be lucrative.",
      "While he sleeps on sandbags after back-breaking days underground, his family lives in a house he has bought in a township of the main city, Johannesburg.",
      "He made cash payments of 130,000 rand (about $7,000; \u00a35,600) for the one-bedroom house, which he has now extended to include another three bedrooms, he said.",
      "An illegal miner for about eight years, Ndumiso has managed to send his three children to fee-paying schools - one of whom is now in university.",
      "\"I have to provide for my wife and children and this is the only way I know,\" he said, adding that he preferred to toil underground rather than adding to the high crime rate by becoming a car-hijacker or robber, after spending many years trying to find legal work.",
      "His current job is at a mine in the small town of Stilfontein, around 90 miles (145km) south-west of Johannesburg, which is at the centre of global attention after a government minister, Khumbudzo Ntshavheni, promised to \"smoke out\" the hundreds of miners who were underground there, with the security forces preventing food and water from being sent down.",
      "\"Criminals are not to be helped. Criminals are to be persecuted,\" Ntshavheni said.",
      "A campaign group, The Society for the Protection of Our Constitution, has launched a court case to demand access to the mineshaft, which police say is about 2km (1.2 miles) deep.",
      "The court has given an interim ruling, stating that food and other essentials could be delivered to the miners.",
      "Ndumiso works at a different shaft at the mine, and surfaced last month, before the current stand-off.",
      "He is now waiting to see how the situation unfolds, before deciding whether to return.",
      "The stand-off follows a government decision to crack down on an industry that has spiralled out of control, with mafia-like gangs running it.",
      "\"The country has been grappling with the scourge of illegal mining for many years, and mining communities bore the brunt of peripheral criminal activities such as rape, robbing and damage to public infrastructure, among others,\" said Mikateko Mahlaule, chairman of the parliamentary committee on mineral resources.",
      "South Africa's President Cyril Ramaphosa said the mine was a \"crime scene\",  but police were negotiating with the miners to end the stand-off, rather than going down to arrest them.",
      "\"Law-enforcement authorities have information that some of the miners may be heavily armed. It is well-established that illegal miners are recruited by criminal gangs and form part of wider organised crime syndicates,\" he added.",
      "Ndumiso was among hundreds of thousands of workers - both locals and nationals of neighbouring states like Lesotho - who have been retrenched as South Africa's mining industry has gone into decline over the last three decades. Many of these have gone on to become \"zama zamas\" at the abandoned mines.",
      "South Africa-based Benchmark Foundation researcher David van Wyk, who has studied the industry, said there were about 6,000 abandoned mines in the country.",
      "\"While they are not profitable for large-scale industrial mining, they are profitable for small-scaling mining,\" he told the BBC Focus on Africa podcast.",
      "Ndumiso said he used to work as a drill operator, earning less than $220 (\u00a3175) a month, for a gold-mining company until he was laid off in 1996.",
      "After struggling for the next 20 years to find a full-time job because of South Africa's crushingly high unemployment rate, he said he decided to become an illegal miner.",
      "There are tens of thousands of illegal miners in South Africa, with Mr Van Wyk saying they number about 36,000 alone in Gauteng province - the country's economic heartland, where gold was first discovered in the 19th Century.",
      "\"Zama zamas will often spend months underground without surfacing and depend heavily on outside support for food and other necessities. It is arduous and dangerous work,\" said a report by campaign group Global Initiative Against Transnational Organised Crime.",
      "\"Some carry pistols, shotguns and semi-automatic weapons to protect themselves from rival gangs of miners,\" it added.",
      "Ndumiso told the BBC that he did own a pistol, but he also paid his gang a monthly \"protection fee\" of about $8.",
      "Its heavily armed guards fend off threats, especially from Lesotho gangs reputed to have more lethal firepower, he said.",
      "Under the 24-hour protection of the gang, Ndumiso said he used dynamite for rock-blasting and rudimentary tools such as a pick axe, spade and chisel to find gold.",
      "Most of what he finds he gives to the gang leader, who pays him a minimum of $1,100 every two weeks. He said he was able to keep some gold, which he sells on the black market to top up his income.",
      "He was among the fortunate miners to have such an arrangement, he said - explaining that others were kidnapped and taken to the shaft to work like slave labourers, receiving no payment or gold.",
      "Ndumiso said he normally stayed underground for about three months at a time, and then came up for two to four weeks to spend time with his family and sell his gold, before going back into the deep pits.",
      "\"I look forward to sleeping on my bed and eating home-cooked meals. Breathing in fresh air is an amazingly powerful feeling.\"",
      "Ndumiso does not come out more often in case he loses his digging spot, but after three months it gets too much to remain underground.",
      "He recalled that once when he reached the surface: \"I was so blinded by the sunlight that I thought I had gone blind.\"",
      "His skin had also become so pale that his wife took him for a medical check-up: \"I was honest with the doctor about where I lived. He did not say anything, and just treated me. He gave me vitamins.\"",
      "Above ground Ndumiso does not just relax. He also works with other illegal miners as ore-bearing rocks brought up from below are blasted and crushed into fine powder.",
      "This is then \"washed\" by his group at a makeshift plant to separate the gold using dangerous chemicals like mercury and sodium cyanide.",
      "Ndumiso said he then sells his share of the gold - one gram for $55, less than the official price of about $77.",
      "He said he has a ready-made buyer, whom he contacts via WhatsApp.",
      "\"The first time I met him I did not trust him so I told him to meet me in the car park of a police station. I knew I would be safe there.",
      "\"Now we meet in any car park. We have a scale. We weigh the gold on the spot. I then hand it to over to him, and he pays me in cash,\" he said, pointing out that he  walks away with between $3,800 and $5,500.",
      "He gets this amount every three months, meaning his average annual income is between $15,500 and $22,000 - far more than the $2,700 he earned as a legally employed miner.",
      "Ndumiso said the gang leaders earned far more, but he did not know how much.",
      "As for the buyer of his gold, Ndumiso said he did not know anything about him, except that he was a white man in an illegal industry that involves people of different races and classes.",
      "This makes it difficult to clamp down on the criminal networks, with Mr Van Wyk saying the government was targeting miners - but not the \"kingpins living in the leafy suburbs of Johannesburg and Cape Town\".",
      "Mr Ramaphosa said that illegal mining was costing \"our economy billions of rands in lost export income, royalties and taxes\", and the government would continue to work with mining firms \"to ensure they take responsibility for rehabilitating or closing mines that are no longer operational\".",
      "Mr Van Wyk told the BBC Focus on Africa podcast that the government would worsen South Africa's economic crisis if it clamped down on the \"zama zamas\".",
      "\"There should be a policy to decriminalise their operations, to better organise them and to regulate them,\" he added.",
      "When Ndumiso goes back underground to work, he takes with him cartons of canned food to avoid paying the exorbitant prices at the \"markets\" that exist there.",
      "Apart from food, basic items - like cigarettes, torches, batteries - and mining tools were sold there, he said.",
      "This suggests that a community - or a small town - had developed underground over the years, with Ndumiso saying there was even a red light district, with sex workers brought underground by the gangs.",
      "Ndumiso said the mine where he worked was made up of several levels, and a labyrinth of tunnels that connected to each other.",
      "\"They are like highways, with signs painted to give directions to different places and levels - like the level that we use as the toilet, or the level that we call the zama-zama graveyard,\" he said.",
      "\"Some are killed by rival gang members; others die during rockfalls and are crushed by massive boulders. I lost a friend after he was robbed of his gold and shot in the head.\"",
      "Although life underground is perilous, it is a risk that thousands like Ndumiso are willing to take, as they say the alternative is to live and die poor in a nation where the unemployment rate stands at more than 30%.",

      "The trail led us to Valeria Baigascina, a 25-year-old, originally from the central Asian state of Kazakhstan but now living in Belarus. A part-time model, she posts regularly about her jet-set lifestyle on social media. In the past two years she has visited Dubai, Sri Lanka and Malaysia.",
      "Her social media gave no indication she was also the director of a firm which had channelled millions of dollars\u2019 worth of equipment to sanctioned companies in Russia, as our search of customs documents revealed.",
      "According to Belarusian registration details, Ms Baigascina was the founder and director of a company called Rama Group LLC. Set up in February 2023, it is registered to an address in Bishkek, the capital of Kyrgyzstan - 2,300 miles (3,713 km) from her home in Belarus.",

      "Trade data shows that since sanctions on Russia were introduced in February 2022, UK exports to Kyrgyzstan have increased by more than 300%. Experts suspect some goods are actually destined for Moscow.",
      "The customs documents obtained by the BBC suggest that Rama Group made two shipments to Moscow of high-end optics that can be used in missiles, tanks and aircraft.",
      "The equipment is listed on the customs form as being made by Beck Optronic Solutions in Hemel Hempstead, Hertfordshire. The company manufactures high-precision lenses used in targeting and surveillance systems.",

      "The lenses and optical technology sold by Beck Optronics are specifically listed as goods that either cannot be legally exported to Russia, or that need permission from UK authorities before any sale can take place.",
      "The BBC has identified, through customs documents, a total of six shipments of products said to have been made by Beck with a total value of $2.1m (\u00a31.6m) and transferred to Moscow through Rama and another intermediary company, Shisan LLC.",
      "In December 2023 and January 2024, Rama Group made its two shipments to Moscow listing them as \u201crotating part of camera\u201d. These shipments went to Sol Group, a company based in Smolensk, 200 miles (320km) south-west of Moscow, which has been sanctioned by the US.",
      "It is not clear what international route the goods took - the documents indicate some of the shipments may actually have originated in Thailand.",

      "She described how senior members of Hybe ignored her and her bandmates, and gave them cold shoulder. She also alleged that employees of the agency bad-mouthed NewJeans on internal communication app and asked a journalist to downplay the group's record sales in one article.",
      "Hybe had previously denied the accusations. The CEO of Ador, which is a subsidiary of Hybe, said at the hearing that she would \"listen more closely\" to her artists.",
      "Her allegations prompted fans to file a petition about workplace bullying to the government.",
      "But on Wednesday, South Korea's labour ministry rejected these claims, saying given the content and nature of the management contract signed by Hanni, she is not regarded as a worker under the country's Labour Standards Act.",
      "\"Individuals must meet the criteria under the Labour Standards Act... to be considered workers. This includes having fixed working hours and providing labour under the employer\u2019s direct supervision and control. Celebrities, including singers, are typically classified as independent contractors,\" Chunghwan Choi, senior partner of Yulchon law firm in Seoul explained.",
      "The government also cites the nature of Hanni's income, which is deemed to be \"profit sharing, rather than wages\", according to local reports, adding that she pays business income tax rather than employment income tax.",
      "One expert has called the response \"utterly unfair and yet unsurprising\".",
      "The work for K-pop idols is \"emotionally and physically exhausting\", according to her, as they work \"incredibly long hours, often seven days a week for months in a row...[with] no clearly defined periods of rest\", says CedarBough Saeji, Assistant Professor of Korean and East Asian Studies at Pusan National University in South Korea.",
      "\"Exploitation of the workers is accepted because they are not regular employees and there is no labour union, or clearly we can now see, no governmental agency to advocate for humane working conditions for them,\" she argues.",
      "There are currently no specific laws in South Korea that provide protections for the working rights of celebrities or artists, says Mr Choi, saying that this \"underscores the urgent need for reforms to address longstanding issues in the entertainment industry\".",
      "One measure that could be put into place to safeguard the working rights of artists is something similar to the Talent Agency Act in Hollywood, which requires talent agencies to obtain licenses and prohibits unfair or exploitative contracts, adds Mr Choi.",
      "However, he adds that \"while there have been discussions about implementing laws similar to the Talent Agency Act, no such legislation has been enacted yet\".",
      "'Idols are Workers'",
      "On Wednesday, New Jeans fans rallied under the hashtag \"IdolsAreWorkers\" in support of the band.",
      "Others pointed out that the decision had a legal basis, as celebrities were not technically seen as workers under the law, but called for greater reforms in the industry.",
      "\"I get what they're saying about the role not qualifying for the legal defintion of workplace harrassment, but this just shows the need for reform in the K-pop industry\", said one user on X.",
      "Hanni has yet to comment on the government's decision.",
      "Hybe, which represents massive K-pop groups such as BTS and Seventeen, is South Korea's largest music firm.",

    "title": "Is nuclear power gaining new energy?",
    "published": "Thu, 21 Nov 2024 00:03:04 GMT",
    "summary": "Countries around the world are building new nuclear power stations.",
    "story": [
      "A decade ago, it seemed as though the global nuclear industry was in an irreversible decline.",
      "Concerns over safety, cost, and what to do with radioactive waste had sapped enthusiasm for a technology once seen as a revolutionary source of abundant cheap energy.",
      "Yet now there is widespread talk of a revival, fuelled by tech giants Microsoft, Google and Amazon all announcing investments in the sector, as well as the growing pressures on wealthy nations to curb their carbon emissions.",
      "But how real is the comeback?",
      "When commercial nuclear power was first developed in the 1950s and 1960s, governments were seduced by its seemingly unlimited potential.",
      "Nuclear reactors could harness and control the same awesome forces released by atomic bombs - to provide electricity for millions of homes. With a single kilogram of uranium yielding some 20,000 times as much energy as a kilogram of coal, it seemed like the future.",
      "But the technology also inspired public fear. And that fear seemed to be justified by the Chernobyl disaster, which spread radioactive contamination across Europe in early 1986.",
      "It fuelled widespread public and political opposition \u2013 and slowed the growth of the industry.",
      "Another accident, at the Fukushima Daichi plant in Japan in 2011, re-energised concerns about nuclear safety. Japan itself shut down all of its reactors in the immediate aftermath, and only 12 have since restarted.",
      "Germany decided to phase out nuclear power altogether. Other countries scaled back plans to invest in new power plants, or extend the lives of ageing facilities.",
      "According to the International Atomic Energy Agency, this led to the loss of 48GW of electric power generation globally between 2011 and 2020.",
      "But nuclear development did not stop. In China, for example, there were 13 nuclear reactors in 2011. There are now 55, with another 23 under construction.",
      "For Beijing, scrambling to meet rapidly growing electricity demand, nuclear had, and still has, a vital role to play.",
      "Now interest in the sector seems to be growing elsewhere once again. This is partly because developed countries are hunting for ways to meet energy demand, while striving to meet emissions reduction targets under the Paris Agreement.",
      "With 2024 projected to be the warmest year on record, the pressure to cut carbon emissions is mounting. A renewed focus on energy security, in the wake of Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, has also been a factor.",
      "South Korea, for example, recently scrapped plans to phase out its large fleet of nuclear power stations over the next four decades \u2013 and will build more instead.",
      "And France has reversed plans to reduce its own reliance on nuclear energy, which provides 70% of its electricity. Instead, it wants to build up to eight new reactors.",
      "In addition, last week the US government reaffirmed at the United Nations Climate Change Conference, or Cop29, held in Azerbaijan, that it intends to triple nuclear power generation by 2050.",
      "The White House had originally pledged to do this on the side lines of last year's conference, Cop28. A total of 31 countries have now agreed to try to triple their use of nuclear power by 2050, including the UK, France and Japan.",
      "Also at Cop29, which ends on Friday, 22 November, the US and UK announced that they would collaborate to speed up the development of new nuclear power technology.",
      "This follows after it was agreed in the final statement or \u201cstocktake\u201d of last year's Cop28 that nuclear should be one of the zero or low emission technologies to be \u201caccelerated\u201d to help combat climate change.",
      "But hunger for clean power is not just coming from governments. Technology giants are striving to develop more and more applications that use artificial intelligence.",
      "Yet AI relies on data \u2013 and data centres need constant, reliable electricity. According to Barclays Research, data centres account for 3.5% of electricity consumption in the US today, but that figure could rise to more than 9% by the end of the decade.",
      "In September, Microsoft signed a 20-year deal to buy power from Constellation Energy, which will lead to the reopening of the infamous Three Mile Island power station in Pennsylvania \u2013 the site of the worst nuclear accident in US history, where a reactor suffered a partial meltdown in 1979.",
      "Despite its tainted public image, another reactor at the plant continued to generate electricity until 2019. Constellation\u2019s chief executive Joe Dominguez described the deal to reopen it as a \"powerful symbol of the rebirth of nuclear power as a clean and reliable energy resource\".",
      "Other tech giants have taken a different approach. Google plans to buy energy produced from a handful of so-called Small Modular Reactors or SMRs \u2013 a nascent technology intended to make nuclear energy easier and cheaper to deploy. Amazon is also supporting SMR development and construction.",
      "SMRs themselves are being promoted, in part, as a solution to one of the biggest drawbacks facing nuclear power today. In western nations, new power stations have to be built to exacting modern safety standards. This makes them prohibitively expensive and complicated to build.",
      "Hinkley Point C is a good example. Britain\u2019s first new nuclear power station since the mid-1990s is being built on a stretch of remote coastline in southwest England.",
      "It is meant to be the first of a batch of new plants to replace the country\u2019s ageing reactor fleet. But the project is running some five years behind schedule and will cost up to \u00a39bn ($11.5bn) more than planned.",
      "It is not an isolated case. The US\u2019s newest reactors at Plant Vogtle in Georgia opened seven years late, and cost more than $35bn \u2013 well over double their original budget.",
      "SMRs are designed to solve this problem. They will be smaller than traditional reactors, using standardised parts that can be assembled quickly, at sites close to where the power is needed.",
      "But while there are some 80 different designs under development globally, according to the International Atomic Energy Agency, the concept has yet to be proven commercially.",
      "Opinions about nuclear power remain highly polarised. Supporters claim the technology is indispensable if climate targets are to be reached. Among them is Rod Adams, whose Nucleation Capital fund promotes investment in nuclear technology.",
      "\u201cNuclear fission has a seven-decade history showing it is one of the safest power sources available,\" he explains.",
      "\u201cIt is a durable, reliable source of power with low ongoing costs already, but capital costs have been too high in Western countries.\"",
      "Opponents though, insist nuclear power is not the answer.",
      "According to Professor M.V. Ramana of the University of British Columbia, it is \u201ca folly to consider nuclear energy as clean\u201d.  It is, he says, \"one of the most expensive ways to generate electricity. Investing in cheaper low-carbon sources of energy will provide more emissions reductions per dollar.\"",
      "If current trends do herald a new nuclear age, one old problem remains. After 70 years of atomic power, there is still disagreement over what to do with the accumulated radioactive waste - some of which will remain hazardous for hundreds of thousands of years.",
      "The answer being pursued by many governments is geological disposal - burying the waste in sealed tunnels deep underground. But only one country, Finland, has actually built such a facility, while environmentalists and anti-nuclear campaigners argue that dumping waste out of sight and out of mind is simply too risky.",
      "Solving that conundrum may be a key factor in dictating whether there really will be a new age of nuclear power.",

    "title": "Ukraine front could 'collapse' as Russia gains accelerate, experts warn",
    "published": "Wed, 20 Nov 2024 11:50:02 GMT",
    "summary": "Moscow's forces have taken more ground since September than they did over the course of 2023, analysts say.",
    "story": [
      "President Biden\u2019s decision to provide anti-personnel mines to Ukraine, and allow the use of long-range missiles on Russian territory comes as the Russian military is accelerating its gains along the front line.",
      "Data from the Institute for the Study of War (ISW) shows that Russia has gained almost six times as much territory in 2024 as it did in 2023, and is advancing towards key Ukrainian logistical hubs in the eastern Donbas region.",
      "Meanwhile, Ukraine's surprise incursion into Russia's Kursk region is faltering. Russian troops have pushed Kyiv's offensive backwards. Experts have questioned the success of the offensive, with one calling it a \"strategic catastrophe\" given manpower shortages faced by Ukraine.",
      "These developments come at a time of heightened uncertainty with a second Donald Trump administration looming. The US president-elect has vowed to bring the war to a close when he takes office in January, with some fearing he could cut future military aid to Ukraine.",
      "Russia advances in eastern Ukraine",
      "In the first few months of the war the front line moved quickly, with Russia gaining ground quickly before being pushed back by a Ukrainian counteroffensive. But in 2023 neither side made any major gains - with the conflict largely sliding into a stalemate.",
      "But new ISW figures suggest the story in 2024 is more favourable for Russia. The ISW bases its analysis on confirmed social media footage and reports of troop movements.",
      "The ISW data shows Moscow\u2019s forces have seized around 2,700 sq km of Ukrainian territory so far this year, compared with just 465 sq km in the whole of 2023, a near six-fold increase.",
      "Dr Marina Miron, a defence researcher at Kings College London, suggested to the BBC that there was a possibility the Ukrainian eastern front \u201cmight actually collapse\u201d if Russia continued to advance at pace.",
      "More than 1000 sq km was taken between 1 September and 3 November, suggesting the push accelerated in recent months. Two areas bearing the brunt of these advances are Kupiansk in Kharkiv region, and Kurakhove, a stepping stone to the key logistical hub of Pokrovsk in Donetsk region.",
      "Kupiansk and areas to the east of the Oskil river were liberated in the Kharkiv offensive of 2022, but Russia has progressively retaken the latter area. In a recent intelligence update, the UK's Ministry of Defence said Russian forces were trying to breach the north-eastern outskirts of the city.",
      "Footage posted on 13 November and verified by the BBC is consistent with this analysis. The video shows a convoy of Russian armour being repelled after making it to within 4km of the key bridge at Kupiansk, the last major road crossing in the area.",
      "While these reports do not necessarily translate to control of an area, it is indicative of how stretched Ukraine\u2019s defensive line has become.",
      "Elsewhere, since retaking the city of Vuhledar in October - an elevated position which sits above key supply lines and which Moscow spent two years fighting for - Russia has thrown resources at Kurakhove.",
      "Ukraine\u2019s forces defending the city have so far repelled attacks to the south and east. But the front line creeps ever closer, with Russia also threatening to encircle defenders from the north and west.",
      "Col Yevgeny Sasyko, a former head of strategic communications with Ukraine\u2019s general staff, said Russia places \u201cpowerful jaws\u201d around the flanks of a city that slowly \u201cgrind though\u201d defences until they collapse.",
      "Footage from the city verified by the BBC showed massive destruction, with residential buildings heavily damaged.",
      "The ISW concludes Moscow now holds a total of 110,649 sq km in Ukraine. For comparison, Ukrainian forces seized just over 1,171 sq km in the first month of its incursion into Kursk - though Russian forces have now retaken nearly half of that territory.",
      "Biden agrees to give Ukraine anti-personnel minesWhat we know about missile system Ukraine has used to strike RussiaWhat arms are the US, UK and other nations supplying?",
      "Biden agrees to give Ukraine anti-personnel mines",
      "What we know about missile system Ukraine has used to strike Russia",
      "What arms are the US, UK and other nations supplying?",
      "Despite its territorial gains, Russia's advance has come at a huge cost.",
      "An analysis carried out by BBC Russian confirmed that at least 78,329 troops have been killed since Russia launched its full-scale invasion in February 2022, with Moscow\u2019s losses from September to November this year more than one-and-a-half times greater than the same period in 2023.",
      "The losses are compounded by the \u201cmeat grinder\u201d approach said to be favoured by Russian commanders - describing the waves of recruits thrown towards Ukrainian positions in a bid to exhaust troops.",
      "Despite the Russian advances, some experts have noted that the actual speed of the offensive is still slow. David Handelman, a military analyst, suggested Ukrainian troops in the east were slowly withdrawing to preserve manpower and resources, rather than suffering from a broader collapse.",
      "The Kursk gambit",
      "Ukraine launched its shock incursion into Russia\u2019s Kursk region in August. It is unclear why Russia took so long to respond to the operation, which saw Kyiv\u2019s troops quickly gain control over a number of border communities.",
      "Dr Miron suggested that while the Kremlin would suffer a domestic political cost for as long as the incursion continued, Russia\u2019s general staff had been keen to keep Ukraine\u2019s forces tied down in Kursk as its forces made gains elsewhere along the front line.",
      "But Moscow is now clearly intent on reclaiming the territory lost on its own soil. Some 50,000 troops have been deployed to the region.",
      "Verified videos from the Kursk region show fierce fighting is taking place - and that Russia is suffering considerable losses in terms of manpower and equipment. But the data clearly shows Ukraine\u2019s control of the region is shrinking.",
      "Since the start of October, Russian counter-attacks have regained some 593 sq km worth of territory in the border region, ISW figures showed.",
      "The Kursk incursion was initially a major boon for Ukraine in terms of morale at a time of serious setbacks, and the audacity of the operation was a reminder of its ability to surprise and harm its enemy.",
      "But Dr Miron said while the Kursk incursion was a moment of \u201ctactical brilliance\u201d it has also been a \u201cstrategic catastrophe\u201d for Ukraine.",
      "\u201cThe whole idea was to maybe gain some political leverage in potential negotiations, but militarily to draw the Russian forces away from the Donbas in order to liberate Kursk. And what we're seeing instead is that Ukrainian units are tied down there.\u201d",
      "Some of Kyiv\u2019s most experienced and effective units are known to be fighting in Kursk. Mechanised units equipped with state-of-the-art Western armour are also involved in the offensive.",
      "Ukrainian leaders had hinted that they hoped the incursion would force Moscow to redirect some of its forces from eastern Ukraine, slowing the Russian advance there. Instead, experts say most reinforcements were moved to Kursk from parts in Ukraine where the fighting is not as intense.",
      "\u201cAccording to Ukrainian soldiers from different parts of the front, the Russian troops reinforcing Kursk were mainly pulled from Kherson and Zaporizhzhia,\u201d Yurri Clavilier, a land analyst with the International Institute for Strategic Studies, told the BBC.",
      "\u201cThe fighting there is not as intense as it is in the East. Some Russian units attacking Kharkiv were also redirected to Kursk as Ukraine managed to stall the Russian onslaught there,\u201d he added.",
      "The importance of territory to both sides is the strength it lends to their position in any potential negotiations. Although no peace negotiations have been discussed, US President-elect Trump has claimed he could end the war within 24 hours, without saying exactly how.",
      "Fears persist in Ukraine that Trump could cut military aid as a means to force Kyiv to the table. President Volodymyr Zelensky told Fox News on Tuesday \"I think we will lose [the war]\" if cuts are pushed through.",
      "\"We have our production, but it's not enough to prevail and I think it's not enough to survive,\" he said.",
      "\u200b\u200bOn Tuesday, Ukraine fired US-supplied long-range missiles into Russia for the first time - a day after Washington gave it permission to do so.\u200b\u200b It is thought that the decision was made in part to help Ukraine hold on to part of the Kursk region, to help use as a bargaining chip in future negotiations.",
      "Dr Miron told the BBC that Russia\u2019s advance has handed them a stronger negotiating position as Trump\u2019s new foreign policy team prepare to take office.",
      "\u201cWhat they're controlling right now, it does give them a certain advantage,\u201d she said. \u201cIf it came to negotiations, I'm sure that as the Russian side has been stressing, \u2018we will do it based on the battlefield configuration\u2019.",

    "published": "Wed, 20 Nov 2024 05:59:31 GMT",
    "summary": "Harvesting olives is an economic necessity for many Palestinians, but it is increasingly precarious.",
    "story": [
      "On a Thursday afternoon towards the end of last month, a 59-year-old Palestinian woman set out to gather olives on her family\u2019s land near the village of Faqqua, in the north of the occupied West Bank.",
      "It was something that Hanan Abu Salameh had done for decades.",
      "Within minutes, the mother of seven and grandmother of 14 lay dying in the dust of the olive grove, with a bullet wound in her chest - she\u2019d been shot by an Israeli soldier.",
      "Even though the family had co-ordinated their intention to pick olives with the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), according to her son Fares and husband Hossam, the soldier fired several shots as other family members fled for cover.",
      "The IDF says it\u2019s investigating the incident, but Hanan\u2019s grieving relatives have little hope or expectation that her killer will be brought to justice.",
      "This wasn\u2019t an isolated incident.",
      "Israeli settlers are seizing Palestinian land under cover of war - they hope permanently",
      "Palestinian killed as Israeli settlers torch West Bank village",
      "Harvesting olives is an age-old ritual and also an economic necessity for many Palestinians, but, according to the UN, it is increasingly precarious.",
      "Farmers across the West Bank - internationally regarded as Palestinian land occupied by Israel - face heightened risks, like organised attacks by Israeli settlers seeking to sabotage the olive harvest, along with the use of force by Israeli security forces to block roads and Palestinians' access to their lands.",
      "\u201cLast year we couldn\u2019t even harvest our olives, except for a very small amount,\u201d says Omar Tanatara, a farmer from the village of Umm Safa.",
      "\u201cAt one point, the army came, threw the olives we\u2019d already gathered on the ground, and ordered us to go home,\u201d says Omar, who is also a member of the village council.",
      "\u201cSome people were even shot at and olives trees were cut down with saws \u2013 that\u2019s how we later found them,\u201d adds Omar, as he and other villagers use small hand-held rakes to pull this year\u2019s harvest from their remaining trees while they can.",
      "Even when Israeli and international activists accompany villagers to their olive groves, hoping to deter the threat, there\u2019s no guarantee of safety.",
      "Zuraya Hadad instinctively winces as we watch a video of the incident in which her ribs were broken by a masked man wielding a large stick.",
      "The Israeli peace activist had been helping Palestinian farmers pick their olives when she was assaulted without provocation.",
      "Rather than arresting her attacker, Israeli soldiers, who\u2019d accompanied settlers to the site, just told him to move on.",
      "\u201cEven when we come to help, it doesn't guarantee that the Palestinians can harvest their olives,\u201d Zuraya tells me as she recovers from her injuries at home.",
      "\u201cWe try to raise awareness, but in the end it's either the settlers steal the olives or cut the trees, or they remain unpicked and go to waste.\u201d",
      "Land is at the heart of the decades-old conflict between Israel and the Palestinians - who controls it and who has access to it.",
      "For thousands of Palestinian families and villages, cultivating and harvesting olives is a big part of their economy.",
      "But many say that, in recent times, access to trees on their land has been impeded, often violently by Israeli settlers.",
      "Hundreds of trees - which can take years to reach fruit-bearing maturity - have been deliberately burned or cut down, says the UN.",
      "More than 96,000 dunums (approximately 96 sq km; 37 sq miles) of olive groves in the West Bank also went uncultivated in 2023 because of Israeli restrictions on access for Palestinian farmers.",
      "After being gathered by hand, villagers from Umm Safa take sacks full of olives to the nearby factory, where the presses have restarted this season.",
      "Olives are the most important agricultural product in the West Bank. In a good year, they're worth more than $70m (\u00a354m) to the Palestinian economy.",
      "But income was well down last year and this year will be even worse, says factory owner Abd al-Rahman Khalifa, as even fewer farmers are able to harvest their crop owing to attacks by settlers.",
      "\u201cLet me give you an example,\u201d he tells me.",
      "\u201cMy brother-in-law in Lubban - next to the Israeli settlement - went to pick his own olives, but they broke his arms and they made him leave along with everyone who was with him.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe, as Palestinians, don\u2019t have petrol or big companies. Our main agricultural crop is olives,\u201d he adds. \u201cSo, like the Gulf depends on oil, and the Americans on business, our economy is dependent on the olive tree.\u201d",
      "On the hill overlooking the olive groves of Umm Safa stands an illegal settler outpost - a farm.",
      "The extremist settler who runs it, Zvi Bar Yosef, was sanctioned this year by the UK and other Western governments for repeated acts of violence against Palestinians, including twice threatening families at gunpoint.",
      "Over the last year of the war in Gaza, Jewish settlers have been emboldened by the support of far-right Israeli ministers like Itamar Ben-Gvir.",
      "As national security minister, he has given out free firearms to hundreds of settlers and has encouraged them to assert their right to what - they say - is their \"God-given\" land.",
      "Ben-Gvir has also been accused of openly supporting the disruption of olive harvesting on Palestinian land.",
      "At the olive press, farmers wait patiently in the yard to witness the transformation of the olives they\u2019ve been able to gather this year into \"liquid gold\".",
      "The olive tree has been a symbol of this land for centuries.",
      "For generations of Palestinians, it is their link to the land - a link that is under threat now more than ever."

    "summary": "CBS News' Anthony Mason joins Paul Simon on a trip to the Stanford Initiative to Cure Hearing Loss, to explore how researchers are getting closer to finding answers about repairing and preventing hearing loss.",
    "story": [
      "When legendary singer-songwriter\u00a0Paul Simon began to lose his hearing\u00a0nearly four years ago while working on his album, \"Seven Psalms,\" he feared he wouldn't be able to perform again.",
      "\"It was incredibly frustrating. I was very angry at first that this had happened,\" Simon told CBS News senior culture correspondent\u00a0Anthony Mason\u00a0in an interview for \"CBS Mornings.\"",
      "He admits one of his biggest fears was giving up what he loves: making music.",
      "\"I guess what I'm most apprehensive about would be if I can't hear well enough to really enjoy the act of making music,\" Simon said.",
      "Since then, he's had dramatic hearing loss, sharing that he now has about 6% hearing in his left ear. But he's learned to make adjustments. He's switched to larger speakers, placing them all around him when he's playing so he can hear better. He's also had to change how and what he plays.",
      "\"I'm going through my repertoire and reducing a lot of the choices that I make to acoustic versions. It's all much quieter. It's not 'You Can Call Me Al.' That's gone. I can't do that one,\" Simon said, chuckling.",
      "Simon is still writing music and he returned to the stage in September for a rare, stripped-down performance at The Soho Sessions in New York.",
      "\"You know Matisse, when he was suffering at the end of his life, when he was in bed, he envisioned all these cut-outs and had a great creative period,\" Simon said. \"So I don't think creativity stops with disability. So far, I haven't experienced that. And I hope not to.\"",
      "Paul Simon's search for answers",
      "At first, doctors told Simon there was nothing they could do about his hearing loss. Then, he learned about the\u00a0Stanford Initiative to Cure Hearing Loss\u00a0(SICHL), which includes a team of nearly 100 scientists searching for ways to prevent, repair and replace damaged inner ear tissue.",
      "That's promising news for Simon and millions like him. Hearing loss is on the rise, affecting nearly 1.5 billion people across the globe, according to Stanford Medicine.",
      "Mason recently joined Simon during a visit to the program's facility in Palo Alto, California, sitting in on Simon's exam with Dr. Konstantina Stankovic.",
      "\"Hearing bones are the smallest bones in the body,\" Dr. Stankovic said. \"And then they are connected to the inner ear, which is called the cochlea. And it looks like a snail.\"",
      "The cochlea is so small and fragile it's impossible to biopsy without causing deafness. It's hidden in the hardest bone in the body, located deep in the skull, Dr. Stankovic explained.",
      "What can animals teach us about hearing loss?",
      "Certain animals can recover from hearing loss because their hair cells regenerate. It's the hairs in the ear, called cilia, that transmit sound to the brain.",
      "\"We actually have the same genetic machinery, it's just turned off in people,\" Dr. Stankovic told Mason. \"And the key question is how do you turn it on? And how do you turn it on safely, because cancer is regeneration gone awry.\"",
      "In a lab at the Stanford Initiative to Cure Hearing Loss , geneticist Teresa Nicolson is studying zebrafish, which have similar inner ear structures to humans.",
      "Nicolson said they've made a recent, exciting discovery. They were able to rescue hearing in zebrafish with hearing loss mutations using an FDA-approved drug. The hope is it could one day be used in humans.",
      "Down the hall, biophysicist Tony Ricci is conducting an experiment focused on mice.",
      "\"So the hair bundle is the site where most damage happens. So with aging, with noise\u2026we are trying to understand how the bundle \u2013 like it's a machine, right? So how this machine works normally,\" Ricci said.",
      "\"So then when we know what piece's parts are getting broken, we can figure out how do we fix it or how do we replace it,\" he added.",
      "Surgeon and scientist Dr. Alan Cheng is using gene therapy to coax the damaged hair cells in mice to regenerate. He's also studying human cochlea samples from organ donors.",
      "\"We're the only place in the world that can do it, in fact,\" Dr. Cheng said.",
      "The team was surprised to find that damaged human hair cells do begin to regenerate on their own, but only partially. Now they need to find out whether the drug cocktail they've used in mice could work in humans.",
      "For Dr. Cheng, this research is personal.",
      "\"My mom, who has hearing loss, she's been asking how can we regenerate cells for her,\" he said.",
      "\"That's what I've been asking ever since I met you guys,\" Simon added with a smile.",

    "story": [
      "Los Angeles\u00a0\u2014 Katt Williams, the Emmy-winning actor and renowned stand-up comedian, for years has claimed to have joined the U.S. Marine Corps as a teenager and successfully navigated the rigorous training only to be drummed out of the military when his superiors discovered he was a minor. The Marines told CBS News they have no record of him.",
      "Dating back to at least 2016, Williams has claimed association with the U.S. Marine Corps when talking about his personal biography in video blogs, in his stand-up routines and in interviews viewed and heard by tens of millions of people. His claims of military service seem to not be attached to any of his critically acclaimed jokes or characters he has created for stage and screen but instead, a part of his journey towards comedy.",
      "The U.S. Marine Corps tells CBS News there's no record of Williams ever entering military service or attending any Marine Corps recruit training camps.",
      "Multiple emails and phone calls were sent to Williams' publicist, Amy Sisoyev, and his representatives at Creative Artists Agency, but no reply was returned for almost two weeks.",
      "Earlier this year, Williams sat down for a nearly 3-hour interview with ESPN's \"First Take\" correspondent Shannon Sharpe on his podcast, \"Club Shay Shay.\" The interview has racked up\u00a0more than 83 million views on YouTube as of publication and is the most watched interview in YouTube's history.",
      "Sharpe, a former Denver Bronco and ex-NFL analyst for CBS Sports, asked Williams about being raised in Florida.",
      "\"I try to join the Marine Corps and they won't accept me because I'm too young, and I've lied and told them I'm 16 and my family is moving down and I don't have my ID but it's coming. And so they [the Marines] let me go to the boot camp,\" said Williams.",
      "Similarly, on comedian Marc Maron's podcast last year, Williams said, \"And then I attempt to join the Marine Corps, and I go off to boot camp and I pass, and then they reveal that I'm too young, and they give me a little ceremony because I did pass, you know, oo-Rah.\"",
      "He added: \"I wasn't even 16. I wasn't even 16. I was already \u2014 I had miscalculated it wrong. I thought that you know, by the time I got back I would be good, but I hadn't turned 16 by the time boot camp was over.\"",
      "Maron, whose \"WTF\" podcast garners more than 55 million listens per year, asked Williams if he got through boot camp and about his ceremony.",
      "Williams reaffirmed that he passed boot camp, saying, \"When you come back everybody gets the ceremony and I was supposed to have been, probably put in the brig or court-martialed or something, but they didn't treat me like that. \u2026 As far as the Marine Corps thing, whatever those commercials were selling, you remember those commercials back in that time \u2026 if you wanted to join a gang, the Marines was the gang to join.\"",
      "On Saturday, CBS News attended the Vulture Festival in Los Angeles where Williams was interviewed about his life and career by Jesse David Fox, a Vulture writer and host of \"Good One: The Podcast About Jokes.\" Williams is set to launch his multistate \"Heaven on Earth\" tour next year.",
      "While Williams did not discuss his alleged short stint in the Marines, the comedian said \"Thank God I tell the truth\" when asked by Fox about his past statements in interviews.",
      "CBS News filed a Freedom of Information Act request for records pertaining to Williams' alleged enlistment in the Marine Corps.",
      "Marine Corps officials searched for records pertaining to Williams using his full name \u2014 Micah Sierra Williams \u2014 and other identifying information such as his date of birth and social security number. Officials told CBS News that their database of official military personnel files dates back to the 1960s, housed at the National Personnel Records Center of the National Archives.",
      "\"We searched the files maintained by the Manpower Management Performance Branch but were unable to identify Mr. Williams as a member or former member of the U.S. Marine Corps,\" wrote an official in response to CBS News' public records request.",
      "Marine Corps officials told CBS News that if Williams' story was accurate, there would be records showing his entry into military service, his graduation and discharge, even if he fraudulently enlisted as a minor.",
      "Army veteran Anthony Anderson, who runs \"Guardians of Valor,\" a popular social media website that investigates service member records, told CBS News that Williams' claims are a \"slap in the face of people who have earned the title of Marine.\"",
      "\"Boot camp for the Marine Corps is not an easy task. To call yourself a Marine, you have to go through at least 13 weeks of boot camp and successfully navigate the crucible \u2026 people have died in training at boot camp trying to earn the title of Marine,\" said Anderson.",
      "While it's unclear when exactly Williams began to claim he graduated from Marine boot camp, the earliest examples CBS News could find stemmed from Williams' 2016 feud with actor and comedian Kevin Hart.",
      "In a video that appears to have been\u00a0recorded by Williams, addressing drug abuse allegations, the comedian says, \"Ever since I got out of the Marine Corps, I can only breathe out of one nostril.\"",
      "That same year, Williams was arrested and charged with disorderly conduct and battery charges after a fight at an apartment complex in Gainesville, Georgia, with a 17-year-old high school wrestler who was also charged, according to previous news reports. Williams pleaded not guilty and the case lingered on until earlier this year when local prosecutors decided to drop the case against Williams.",
      "Soon after his arrest Williams spoke about the episode on stage, suggesting that he wasn't actually put into a chokehold by the teenager and in fact, that Williams had let him win, adding, \"I'm Semper Fi till I die, Marine Corps b----. I passed motherf---ing boot camp at 16.\"",
      "Williams' routine was removed from YouTube due to copyright infringement issues, but the video still exists in the reader forum on Military.com, a military news and culture website. A user posted the video to the website in 2016 and asked: \"Katt Williams a Marine?\"",

    "summary": "With the release of part one of her new memoir, Cher talks about her relationship - on stage and off - with Sonny Bono, and why their TV partnership survived beyond their marriage.",
    "story": [
      "It took too long for Cher to get into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame. \"I thought, what do I have to do?\" she said. \"I've had number one records in all these decades. I had a song [\"Believe\"] that changed music forever. And so, what is it that I've gotta do?\"",
      "This year she finally made it. At her induction ceremony last month, she said, \"It was easier getting divorced from two men than it was to get into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame!\"",
      "It also took forever for Cher to write her story. This week, \"Cher: The Memoir \u2013 Part One\" finally comes out. Asked what she wanted to say with the book, she replied, \"In the beginning, I didn't wanna say much. And then at some point, I just thought, Cher, do it or give the money back.\"",
      "The book centers on her years with Sonny, and her itinerant childhood with a mother who married at least seven times. She writes of how she had to be a grownup from the beginning: \"One time we were driving in the car and she said, 'Cher, I don't know how we're gonna pay the rent. What do you think?' And I was like, 'Okay, how is this gonna work? How are we gonna do this?'\"",
      "In 1962, Cherilyn Sarkisian met Sonny Bono in a coffee shop. He was wearing a mohair suit and a mustard-colored shirt with a white collar. \"I thought it was like when Tony met Maria,\" she said. \"Everybody disappeared, and it was just the two of us.\"",
      "But she said it was not love at first sight. \"It was something,\" Cher said. \"I never felt it before.\"",
      "Sonny was 27, Cher was 16. \"It wasn't passionate; I just loved him,\" she said.",
      "What did she love about him? \"How he was different than anyone else. And he made me laugh. And we had a dream.\"",
      "That dream came true. By the mid-1960s, Sonny & Cher had five songs in the top 50 at the same time. They had a #1 hit with \"I Got You Babe.\"",
      "In the 1970s, on \"The Sonny & Cher Comedy Hour,\" they'd become America's favorite couple, with their banter, their songs, and that Bob Mackie wardrobe: \"And then, when they started to realize that people were tuning in because of what I was wearing, then they just gave us all the money we needed,\" she said. \"It was so much fun.\"",
      "But Sonny began to change. \"He just started not to care,\" Cher said.",
      "About what? \"About me.\"",
      "He didn't like her going out, or even talking with their band. But one member had his eye on her: A guitarist by the name of Bill. One night Cher met up with him. \"We walked back to this place where the guys used to get high before the show. And then he kissed me, and it was like, Oh, my God.\"",
      "Somehow word got back to Sonny. \"I don't know if I can actually say what happened because it's so personal, and it's so \u2026 it's embarrassing,\" Cher said.",
      "But it's in the book: After Sonny asked her what she wanted to do, Cher writes: \"I said, 'I want to sleep with Bill.' It all seems crazy now. I didn't mean it, but I thought saying those words was the only way that he would let me go.\"",
      "\"I thought if I do this, it's over,\" she said. \"He's not gonna be able to come back. We're not gonna be able to be Sonny & Cher. I just wanna blow it up. But I didn't know I wanted to blow it up until I was blowing it up.\"",
      "They offered her anything to keep up appearances: \"Because everybody was afraid I was gonna blow up the show. They just said, 'What do you want?' And I said, 'Well, I want my own place in Malibu. And I want $5,000 a month. Hello? And I want freedom.'\"",
      "But Sonny & Cher kept up the fa\u00e7ade for two more years, until Cher's new boyfriend, record executive David Geffen, got a copy of her contract, and she learned the shocking truth: \"Sonny owned 95 percent of the company and his lawyer owned five,\" she said. \"And it was called Cher Enterprises, but I own nothing! And we'd worked together for almost 12 years.\"",
      "She confronted Sonny: \"I said, 'When was the moment that you thought this would be a good idea?' And he said, 'I always knew you'd leave me.' And I said, 'That's not a reason! Son, how could you do it? I was there by your side working, all those nights, all those days, through good, through bad.' He didn't have an answer.",
      "\"And we were still friends after that,\" she said.",
      "Even after Cher married Gregg Allman and was pregnant with their son, she rejoined Sonny for a revival of their TV show.",
      "Mason asked, \"Can you explain why it was that up on that stage all the other stuff seemed to go away?\"",
      "\"Because we had fun with each other,\" Cher replied. \"And because on stage, there was no marriage. There was no discord. There was no word for our relationship. And you couldn't cut it with a chainsaw.\"",

      "Mescal has star power of his own, as we saw when we witnessed a sea of people following us when we met at Trinity College, where, not so long ago, he'd studied acting.",
      "He's proving to be a singular actor, at least until a recent look-a-like contest. \"I feel like it's easy to do a parody of me,\" he laughed.",
      "\"The shorts?\"",
      "\"Yeah yeah yeah.\"",
      "Those shorts are the uniform of his other love, Gaelic football. For \"Gladiator II,\" this athlete bulked-up, putting on 18 pounds of muscle.",
      "I asked, \"The role is so different. You're often playing these kind of softer, almost tormented, shy characters. It's a major transition for you.\"",
      "\"Yeah, it is,\" he replied. \"I think going back to the sport that I played before, there was definitely a desire to make a more physically-informed choice with a character Lucius represented, like, the perfect opportunity for that to happen.\"",
      "\"Normal People,\" his big break, was shot at his alma mater. In it, Mescal portrays the sharp, nuanced emotions of a student: angst, torment, desire. \"I think it exposed an audience to me,\" Mescal said. \"That job essentially allowed me to prove to people that I can act.\"",
      "The series came after he made a commercial for an Irish sausage company: \"Yeah, that covered my rent for the year. I was absolutely delighted by it.\"",
      "He'd started acting at 16, and a high school production of \"Phantom of the Opera\" changed his trajectory. \"I think I'm still chasing that feeling again,\" he said. \"Nothing has ever really come close to that feeling.\"",
      "\"Your high school 'Phantom of the Opera' production vs. 'Gladiator II'?\" I asked.",
      "\"It sounds absolutely bizarre! I think because it felt physically dangerous in my body to be exposed to an audience of people who knew me as somebody who played sports. The adrenaline was, like, extraordinary.\"",
      "His childhood, he says, was pretty standard. His mother was a policewoman, his dad a teacher, both now retired. But he credits that upbringing with helping him navigate today's pressures.",

    "story": [
      "Nationwide rates of emergency room visits for babies with Mycoplasma pneumoniae are on track to surpass rates for school-age children, data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shows, as doctors nationwide are grappling with a surge of \"walking pneumonia\" cases.",
      "The new figures come from the CDC's National Syndromic Surveillance Program, which gathers data on pneumonia-associated emergency room visits from U.S. hospitals.",
      "While cases had been higher in school-age kids compared to other age groups, rates in babies have surged in recent weeks, and are now tied with older kids. According to the latest CDC data, for the week ending Nov. 2, 7.6% of emergency department pneumonia cases for babies 0-1 years old and children ages 5-17 years old resulted in Mycoplasma pneumoniae diagnoses.",
      "\"These diagnoses dropped a little after August, but remained high through early November. Of note, diagnoses among 0\u20131-year-olds have steadily increased throughout the fall without any subsequent decrease,\" CDC spokesperson Jasmine Reed said in a statement Tuesday.",
      "During the COVID-19 pandemic, cases largely disappeared. CDC officials had said that this year's wave could be heralding a return to waves of Mycoplasma pneumoniae cases that occurred prior to the pandemic.",
      "But this year's trend has also been unusual, since cases had previously been thought to be common only in school-aged kids, not younger children.",
      "\"While we are seeing right now that it is presenting as a typical respiratory infection, we want to make sure that there isn't something unusual going on with the bacteria itself or the way it's showing up that might give guidance in how to treat and prevent it,\" Dr. Adam Cohen, head of the CDC's pneumonia branch, told Medscape News earlier this month.",
      "According to Reed, while every U.S. region is seeing an increase in Mycoplasma pneumoniae cases, the CDC's data suggests that since at least last month \u2014 when several states first began to raise concerns over the surge \u2014 the ERs of three regions specifically are seeing the highest levels of the bacteria.",
      "One is in the South and spans Texas and its neighbors Arkansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma and New Mexico. The second is in the Midwest and includes Iowa, Kansas, Missouri and Nebraska. The third is in the Northeast and includes New York and New Jersey.",
      "\"Maybe it's another one of those things that we didn't see, got really suppressed during COVID, and now it's coming back,\" said Dr. Jennifer Nayak, division chief of pediatric infectious disease at Golisano Children's Hospital in New York. \"It just is definitely a really bad year for Mycoplasma.\"",
      "Nayak said that around a quarter of tests from the hospital's microbiology lab have come in positive for the bacteria, which she says is unusually high.",
      "The hospital has also seen an increase in patients needing to be hospitalized for the bacteria and who are battling a range of conditions \u2014 from lung issues to more complicated neurological complications \u2014 though they remain a fraction of overall cases.",
      "\"We've definitely seen more kids on the seriously ill side of the spectrum,\" Nayak said. \"Likely not because the bacteria has changed, but because our rates overall are just higher.\"",
      "She cautioned that while the recent increase has been unusual, there has not been a lot of data tracking the disease, so comparisons to previous waves of the bacteria have been challenging.",
      "\"Our tracking of Mycoplasma infections is suboptimal,\" Nayak said. \"This is not something that is reportable to health departments. It has not, until relatively recently, been closely tracked.\"",
      "A spokesperson for the New York State Department of Health said that it has also tracked a \"marked increase\" in Mycoplasma pneumoniae based on data from the state's emergency rooms, compared to previous years.",
      "While not all pneumonia cases warrant antibiotics, Nayak said testing can be important to give answers for children and their families battling persistent or serious pneumonia cases, as well as to help make decisions about how to treat the infections.",
      "\"The amoxicillin your child is getting because they might have an ear infection, or you think you're treating another community-acquired pneumonia, those antibiotics will not be effective against Mycoplasma,\" Nayak said.",

    "summary": "Canada legalized medically assisted dying in 2016. It was set to expand to patients suffering solely from mental illness last year, but it hasn't \u2014 yet.",
    "story": [
      "When Savannah Meadows had lunch last October with her mother, Sharon Turcott, Meadows was \"all smiles,\" the mother told CBS News.",
      "\"Maybe she's turned a corner,\" Turcott recalled thinking about her daughter, who had been struggling with serious mental illness.",
      "The next morning, she received a scheduled email: \"Mom, if you're reading this, I'm probably on my way to heaven,\" it said. Her daughter had taken her own life at the age of 44.",
      "\"She did not want to die by suicide. She did not want to die alone,\" Turcott said.",
      "Instead, Meadows had been seeking a medically assisted death \u2014 something Canada legalized in 2016. It had been set to expand last year to patients who were suffering solely from mental illness, but that expansion was delayed, and Meadows ultimately died by suicide.",
      "The delay has been welcomed by some, but condemned by others.",
      "The history of Canada's, still evolving MAID law",
      "In 2016, Canada enacted a law allowing medical assistance in dying, known as MAID, for people whose natural death is reasonably foreseeable. Under the law, following a process establishing that all eligibility criteria have been met, a physician or nurse either directly administers a substance that induces death or prescribes a drug that the person takes themselves.",
      "Five years later, the law was expanded, no longer requiring a person's death to be reasonably foreseeable as an eligibility criterion for adults with a grievous and irremediable medical condition. Under the changes, individuals suffering solely from mental illness were temporarily excluded for eligibility until March 2023.",
      "Meadows, described by her mother as a proud trans woman, had picked a date and began preparations for the end of her life.",
      "\"It gave me time to accept the fact that my daughter was going to die,\" Turcott said.",
      "A few days before Meadows would potentially have been eligible to seek a medically assisted death, however, the government announced a yearlong delay for the consideration of cases of mental illness. Seven months later, Meadows died by suicide.",
      "The delayed inclusion of patients seeking MAID on the basis of mental illness has been met with apprehension from the start.",
      "Canada's Expert Panel on MAID and Mental Illness, established to assist in developing the government's approach to the expansion of the law, outlined concerns in a 2022 report, including the daunting task for clinicians asked to make predictions about individual patients and establish incurability and irreversibility despite the difficulties of predicting the evolution of mental disorders.",
      "Another factor was what the report referred to as structural vulnerability, or the risk of factors such as unstable housing or lack of employment opportunities resulting in individuals viewing death as an only option.",
      "The panel offered a number of recommendations in its report for establishing an expanded MAID regime.",
      "The future of the MAID law's expansion, however, is also dependent to some degree on domestic politics, which appear set to shift. Pierre Poilievre, whose Conservative Party is up by a significant margin in polls ahead of national elections set to take place within a year, has vowed to \"revoke entirely\" the expansion of the law to include solely mental health cases, arguing that it blurred a line \"between suicide prevention and suicide  assistance.\"",
      "\"She would have died the way she wanted to.\"",
      "Since her daughter's death, meanwhile, Turcott has become an advocate for MAID access for those whose sole underlying condition is mental illness.",
      "\"She would have died the way she wanted to, and because that's what she wanted, that would have been fine with me,\" Turcott said. \"Suicide was not fine with me.\"",
      "In February, the government further postponed MAID eligibility for patients whose sole condition is mental illness until March 2027 \u2014 four years after it was initially slated to go into effect.",
      "Mark Holland, Canada's Minister of Health, said that while \"significant progress has been made in supporting practitioners in assessing MAID eligibility in complex cases,\" the country's health system was \"not yet ready for MAID where the sole underlying condition is mental illness.\"",
      "The delay has been condemned by some MAID advocates. Dying With Dignity Canada, an organization that advocates for end-of-life rights, filed a lawsuit in August alleging discriminatory exclusion in the law against people with mental illness.",
      "An ongoing debate over access to MAID",
      "Others, however, view the delay as a step to ensure necessary safeguards are in place and health care providers are prepared to handle relevant cases. The Canada Mental Health Association said in a January statement that it supported the postponement, citing what it called insufficient time and resources allocated to ensure that people with mental illnesses can access the necessary care.",
      "Some groups oppose the law's expansion outright. In September, Inclusion Canada, a nonprofit group that advocates for Canadians with intellectual disabilities, filed a lawsuit challenging MAID for people with a disability who are not dying or whose death is not \"reasonably foreseeable.\"",
      "The lawsuit argues that MAID Track 2, the 2021 expansion of the law to include patients whose deaths are not reasonably foreseeable, had already resulted in premature deaths.",
      "\"People are dying. We are witnessing an alarming trend where people with disabilities are seeking assisted suicide due to social deprivation, poverty and lack of essential supports,\" Krista Carr, executive vice-president of Inclusion Canada, said in September.",
      "Compounding CMHA and Inclusion Canada's concerns, an expert committee of professionals from disciplines including ethics, social work and medicine that reviewed MAID deaths in Ontario identified cases in which it said isolation and unmet social needs, such as housing, had fueled several euthanasia recipient's requests.",
      "The committee also found that patients seeking eligibility under the expanded Track 2 criteria were about 8% more likely to reside in areas of the province with high levels of social marginalization than MAID Track 1 recipients.",
      "The committee's report acknowledged that while the deaths discussed were not necessarily representative of frequent reasons for accessing MAID Track 2, or even the majority of MAID Track 2 deaths, the themes identified were \"not uncommon within the MAID review process.\"",
      "Out of 4,644 medically assisted deaths carried out during 2023 under Canada's MAID law, only 116 deaths were Track 2 patients, according to the committee.",
      "But the report's findings don't resonate with everyone, and opposition to the law's proposed inclusion of patients who suffer from only mental illness has been deeply frustrating for some people seeking MAID.",
      "Jason, a Toronto resident who didn't want to be fully identified over concerns that his future MAID review process could be affected, is one of those people.",
      "\"When I first heard that it was delayed, my world came crashing down,\" he said.",
      "Jason told CBS News that he's struggled with depression, anxiety and panic attacks for decades, and has attempted suicide twice. He said he's tried inpatient programs, medication, electroconvulsive therapy and ketamine treatment, among other remedies, to little avail.",
      "\"I would not be alive today if there wasn't the possibility of MAID going through in 2027,\" he said, saying the chance of MAID's expansion was the only reason he hadn't attempted suicide a third time.",
      "The current safeguards for those seeking MAID whose death is not reasonably foreseeable include two independent practitioners \u2014 one of whom must have expertise in the condition affecting the patient \u2014 confirming that all eligibility criteria are met, a minimum period of 90 days for eligibility assessments to be made, and the opportunity for the patient to withdraw consent at any point up until the procedure is carried out.",
      "The patient must also be informed of counseling and palliative care options, support for disabilities and mental health, and be offered consultation with relevant professionals in addition to having discussed with their practitioner \"reasonable and available means to relieve the person's suffering, and agree [with the practitioner] that the person has seriously considered these means.\"",
      "In a poll conducted in 2023 by Dying with Dignity Canada, 78% of respondents said they supported the removal of the \"reasonably foreseeable\" natural death requirement from the MAID law, indicating strong support for the Track 2 expansion. But a 2017 survey gauging the attitudes of Canadian psychiatrists toward medical assistance in death found only a minority of 29.4% supported MAID on the basis of mental illness alone, compared to 71.8% who said other factors should also be present to determine eligibility.",
      "Jason said he understood some doctors' opposition to MAID for mental illness.",
      "\"Doctors are there to make you better,\" he said. But he added that as mental illness isn't something that \"shows up on a screen,\" it can be difficult for people without direct experience to understand the extent of someone else's pain.",
      "\"I don't have the physical pain that someone else has, but the psychological pain is just as bad,\" he said.",
      "In 2022, MAID deaths accounted for 4.1% of overall deaths in Canada, with the average age of MAID patients being 77, according to Canada's fourth and most recent annual report on Medical Assistance in Dying. Since the law was introduced in 2016 there have been a total of 44,958 medically assisted deaths in the country.",
      "Jason said he didn't want to put his family through the trauma of another suicide attempt, and that his brother and mother were helping him explore options abroad. Those options, especially for people suffering mental illness, are limited, and often complicated by varying domestic laws around the world.",
      "Jason said that, like Turcott, his own mother is supportive of his choice to seek MAID.",
      "\"As much as she doesn't want me to do this again, she would rather I die properly with the assistance of a doctor than have it done by suicide,\" he said.",
      "Turcott said she was concerned that the postponement of MAID on the basis of mental health would result in more suicides, leaving families to mourn unexpectedly.",
      "\"I don't want anybody to experience the loss of their child through suicide, and their child being so desperate that they saw no other choice but to take their life,\" she said.",

      "Officials suspect wild migrating birds are likely to blame for the first known infection of a flock in Hawaii, which had been the last state in the country with no reported cases in poultry or wild birds during the current outbreak.",
      "Sequencing done by the U.S. Department of Agriculture's national lab in Iowa confirmed the infection, federal officials announced Monday.",
      "The specific genotype of the virus that infected the birds is known as A3, said Lyndsay Cole, a spokesperson for the federal Animal Plant Health Inspection Services.",
      "This is different from the B3.13 genotype that has been fueling this year's unprecedented outbreak on dairy and poultry farms and suggests the virus spilled over into the flock in Hawaii from migrating wild birds.",
      "Investigators have not turned up any links so far between the flock and imported animals or travel, a spokesperson for Hawaii's Agriculture Department said. The island has \"strict importing regulations for birds and other animals,\" the spokesperson said.",
      "All the infected birds were housed at the same site, though investigations are ongoing to root out other potential cases. The birds were also not symptomatic until several days after the fair, the state Health Department said, lowering the risk to humans.",
      "\"As the birds were not showing signs of infection at the time of the fair, the likelihood of spreading H5N1 to humans is low. However, out of an abundance of caution, DOH recommends that individuals who attended the fair and touched a duck or goose monitor for influenza-like illness (ILI) and conjunctivitis,\" the state said in a release.",
      "A quarantine order was issued for the property where the birds lived and all will be required to be \"depopulated and the premises cleaned and disinfected,\" the state Agriculture Department said. An order was also issued to prevent any animals from being moved in or out of the site.",

      "At least 53 cases have been confirmed across seven states so far this year, the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u00a0says. Most are linked to the B3.13 version of the virus that has been infecting workers at dairy farms and nearby poultry farms in recent months. None of them are known to have been severely ill.",
      "Health officials in Canada announced this month\u00a0that they had detected a case of H5N1 bird flu in a critically ill hospitalized teenager. That patient had been infected by the D1.1 genotype of H5N1, which is related to another ongoing poultry outbreak in British Columbia, the Canadian province where they lived.",

    "summary": "Canada's Bestar recalled wall beds only after learning of dozens of cases in which its beds detached from the walls, feds say.",
    "story": [
      "Canada's Bestar has agreed to a more than $16 million civil penalty for failing to report\u00a0a defect in its wall beds until after one person was killed and more than a dozen others injured, some seriously, federal officials say.",
      "Starting in September of 2014 and continuing through 2022, Bestar received numbers of reports that the products had detached from the wall. By 2016, the company was told of two cases in which people had been injured by the beds falling on them, according to a settlement agreement announced on Monday by the Consumer Product Safety Commission.",
      "The furniture company then engaged with CPSC and Health Canada, but did not tell regulators of an additional five incidents it had become aware of by that time, the document said. In 2018, a Bestar wall bed fell on an elderly woman, causing injuries that led to her hospitalization and death later that year.",
      "All told, Bestar was aware of 35 incidents in which its beds detached from walls and fell on people, resulting in the fatality and 15 injuries, some of which were serious, according the Consumer Product Safety Commission. Bestar knowingly failed to immediately report that its wall beds posed a serious impact and crushing hazard, as is required by law, the agency said Monday in a news release.",
      "The CPSC has agreed to suspend all but $4 million of the $16.025 penalty because paying more than that would cause the company to go out of business.",
      "Bestar and the commission announced a recall of the wall beds on April 7, 2022, warning consumers that a 79-year-old woman had died after a wall bed fell on her, injuring her spine. Bestar and the CPSC at that time stated the company had received reports of 60 additional incidents resulting in bruising and other injuries from the beds detaching and hitting people.",
      "About 129,000 of the wall beds were sold in the U.S. from June 2014 through March 2022 online at Amazon.com, Costco.com, Cymax.com and Wayfair.com. Bestar also sold roughly 53,000 of the wall beds in Canada.",
      "The commission explained the discrepancy between the lower number of incidents noted in its current press release and the higher case count in its 2020 recall as a matter of what the company had reported at specific times.",
      "\"Our penalty cases focus on when the firms reported to us; not the recall date. So, it is earlier in time; thus, fewer incidents,\" a CPSC spokesperson stated in an email.",
      "The settlement does not constitute an admission of guilt by Bestar to allegations including it knowingly broke the law, it said in the document. The company had not received \"substantiated claims\" that its beds had fallen on people so long as they were properly assembled and anchored to the wall.",
      "Bestar did not immediately respond to a request for further comment.",
      "Bestar purchased Bush Industries in 2020, with both brands now operating under a corporate parent, eSolutions Furniture Group, which was established in 2021 and is based in Sherbrooke, Quebec, Canada. It\u00a0operates\u00a0manufacturing plants in Lac-Megantic and Sherbrooke, Canada, as well as in Jamestown, New York, Erie, Pennsylvania, Reno, Nevada, Sacramento, California and Asia.",

    "published": "Sun, 17 Nov 2024 10:51:24 -0500",
    "summary": "There is currently no cure for Parkinson's Disease. But some with Parkinson's are finding that an unusual therapy \u2013 rock climbing \u2013 is helping them improve their balance, mobility, strength and cognition.",
    "story": [
      "We were amazed at what we were seeing on a sweltering summer's day, when a group of people with Parkinson's Disease began rock-climbing on the Carderock Cliffs of Maryland. Yes, rock-climbing!",
      "It's all part of their therapy, says Molly Cupka, the no-nonsense instructor and cheerleader for this community of courageous climbers.",
      "She started this program, called UpENDing Parkinsons, as a non-profit twelve years ago.",
      "\"There's a lot of balance involved, mobility involved, strength, cardio, and then there's the cognitive part, where you have to look at the hold, and figure out how to get your body to move to get to that hold,\" she said.",
      "How often do they fall? \"Falling is definitely part of climbing,\" said Cupka. But they never really fall, because they wear a harness that provides a layer of safety. \"You're always on the rope. You fall, but you don't fall far. We always say if you're not falling, you're not trying hard enough!\"",
      "There's no cure for Parkinson's, which usually affects mobility, coordination, balance, and even speech. Jon Lessin was diagnosed in 2003. He was once an all-around athlete. About 12 years ago he retired as a cardiac anesthesiologist because of Parkinson's. His daughter, Brittany, watched his steady decline, until he discovered climbing walls as high as 60 feet!",
      "\"My dad has a hard time walking across the room, but he can make it to the top of this giant wall,\" Brittany said. \"There's a lot that he's had to give up because of his disease. But this is something that he found through it, which is really cool.\"",
      "Jon said, \"I get to the top and I feel like I've conquered something. And I feel like the wall can't beat me. I can beat the wall.\"",
      "Full disclosure: This story is very personal to me. My late husband, Aaron Latham, had Parkinson's, and boxed as a way to fight the symptoms, as he explained on \"Sunday Morning\" in 2015. \"Boxing's just the opposite of Parkinson's,\" said Latham. \"Everything's designed, instead of to shrink you, everything's designed to pump you up.\"",
      "Jon Lessin said Parkinson's \"makes you feel very small. You make small movements, you're hunched over. And [rock climbing] makes you feel like you can accomplish the world.\"",
      "It was Lessin who first had that big idea to use rock climbing as a therapy for Parkinson's. \"I wanted to do big-movement exercise,\" he said. \"And I found Molly at this gym.\"",
      "Lessin proposed the idea to Molly Cupka, who runs the Sportrock Climbing Center in Alexandria, Virginia. She thought it was worth a try, given the sport requires participants to plan ahead, to know where to position their hands and feet. \"I wish I could go into the brain and see what's happening while people climb,\" Cupka said.",
      "Some people with Parkinson's, like Vivek Puri, get dyskinesia (involuntary jerking motions). Puri said he's usually unaware of his. He runs a home building company in the D.C. area, and was only 38 when he found out he had Parkinson's. \"Fine motor skills have kind of really suffered dramatically,\" he said. \"When I don't climb for some periods of time, I get worse.\"",
      "But once he gets on the wall, he calls himself Spider-Man.",
      "\"Honestly, I climb like a monkey,\" he said. \"I get my finger strength moving, which gets my fine motor skills \u2013 maybe not back, but kind of keeps that in motion.\"",
      "There's no evidence climbing slows the progress of Parkinson's, but Cupka joined forces with Marymount University last year to study patients climbing for the first time. \"We have people literally walking and carrying weights, you know, walking and looking, multitasking,\" she said.",
      "The study found that, in so many words, if you climb, you may walk better.",

      "Marymount University's Center for Optimal Aging study on physical and psychosocial effects of rock climbing on individuals with Parkinson's disease",
      "Mark de Mulder, a musician and former director of the National Geospatial Program, doesn't need a study to prove what climbing does for him. \"It allows me to say, 'All right, take that, Parkinson's! I'm doing this!' It just makes me feel stronger, and I'm fighting it. I'm doing something about it.\"",
      "Many of the climbers have become friends who climb together several times a week; and they've become a support group, Parkinson's Pals, who encourage each other.",
      "\"When I reach the top, I can turn around and look and wave, and see my wife and my friends, and that's the reward,\" said de Mulder. \"It's really wonderful.\"",
      "There's no real understanding of how these people can do this, but you can certainly understand why. An emotional Vivek Puri said, \"It's nice to be good at something.\"",

      "Deepware",
      "Deepware, a website that's free to use, initially failed to flag two of the fake videos the I-Team tested. In an email, the company said the clips used were too short and that for the best results, videos uploaded should be between 30 seconds and one minute. Deepware correctly identified all videos that were longer. According to the company, its detection rate is considered good for the industry at 70%.",
      "The frequently asked questions section of Deepware's website states: \"Deepfakes are not a solved problem yet. Our results indicate the likelihood of a specific video being a deepfake or not.\"",
      "Deepfake Detector",
      "Deepfake Detector, a tool that charges $16.80 per month, identified one of the fake videos as \"97% natural voice.\" The company, which specializes in spotting AI-generated voices, said in an email that factors like background noise or music can impact results, but it has an accuracy rate of approximately 92%.",
      "In response to a question about guidance for average consumers, the company wrote: \"Our tool is designed to be user-friendly. Average consumers can easily upload an audio file on our website or use our browser extension to analyze content directly. The tool will provide an analysis to help determine if a video may contain deepfake elements using probabilities, making it accessible even for those unfamiliar with AI technology.\"",
      "Attestiv",
      "Attestiv flagged two of the real videos as \"suspicious.\" According to the company's CEO Nicos Vekiarides, false positives can be triggered by factors like graphics and edits. Both authentic videos flagged as \"suspicious\" included graphics and edits. The site offers a free service, but it also has a paid tier, where consumers can adjust settings and calibrations for more in-depth analysis.",
      "While he acknowledges that Attestiv isn't perfect, Vekiarides said that as deepfakes become harder to spot with the naked eye, these kinds of websites are needed as part of the solution.",
      "\"Our tool can determine if something is suspicious, and then you can verify it with your own eyes to say, 'I do think that's suspicious,'\" Vekiarides said.",
      "DeepFake-O-Meter",

      "In response to a question about how everyday users can use the tool, the company emailed: \"Currently, the main result shown to users is the probability value of this sample being a generated sample across different detection models. This can be used as a reference if multiple models agree on the same answer with confidence (e.g., over 80% for AI-generated or below 20% for real video).

    "published": "Wed, 20 Nov 2024 23:40:00 -0500",
    "summary": "The proposed breakup calls for Google to sell its industry-leading Chrome web browser and impose restrictions designed to prevent its Android smartphone software from favoring its search engine.",
    "story": [
      "U.S. regulators want a federal judge to break up Google to prevent the company from continuing to squash competition through its dominant search engine after a court found it had maintained an abusive monopoly over the past decade.",
      "The proposed breakup floated in a 23-page document filed late Wednesday by the U.S. Justice Department calls for Google to sell its industry-leading Chrome web browser and impose restrictions designed to prevent its Android smartphone software from favoring its search engine.",
      "The recommended penalties underscore how severely regulators operating under President Biden believe Google should be punished following an August ruling by U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta that branded Google as a monopolist. The Justice Department decision-makers who will inherit the case after President-elect Donald Trump takes office next year might not be as strident. The Washington, D.C. court hearings on Google's punishment are scheduled to begin in April and Mehta is aiming to issue his final decision before Labor Day.",
      "If Mehta embraces the Justice Department's recommendations, Google will almost certainly appeal the punishments, prolonging a legal tussle that has dragged on for more than four years.",
      "Besides seeking a Chrome spinoff and corralling of the Android software, the Justice Department wants the judge to ban Google from forging multibillion-dollar deals to lock in its dominant search engine as the default option on Apple's iPhone and other devices.",
      "Regulators also want Google to share data it collects from people's queries with its rivals, giving them a better chance at competing with the tech giant.",
      "The measures, if they are ordered, threaten to upend a business expected to generate more than $300 billion in revenue this year \u2014 a moneymaking machine that has given Google's parent company, Alphabet Inc.",
      "\"The playing field is not level because of Google's conduct, and Google's quality reflects the ill-gotten gains of an advantage illegally acquired,\" the Justice Department asserted in its recommendations. \"The remedy must close this gap and deprive Google of these advantages.\"",
      "It's still possible that the Justice Department could ease off attempts to break up Google, especially if Trump takes the widely expected step of replacing Jonathan Kanter, who was appointed by Biden to oversee the agency's antitrust division.",
      "Although the case targeting Google was originally filed during the final months of Trump's first term in office, Kanter oversaw the high-profile trial that culminated in Mehta's ruling against Google. Working in tandem with Federal Trade Commission Chair Lina Khan, Kanter took a get-tough stance against Big Tech that triggered other attempted crackdowns on industry powerhouses such as Apple and discouraged business deals from getting done during the past four years.",
      "Trump recently expressed concerns that a breakup might destroy Google but didn't elaborate on the alternative penalties he might have in mind. \"What you can do without breaking it up is make sure it's more fair,\" Trump said last month. Matt Gaetz, the former Republican congressman that Trump nominated to be the next U.S. Attorney General, has previously called for the breakup of Big Tech companies.",
      "Gaetz, a firebrand for Trump, faces a tough confirmation hearing.",
      "This latest filing gave Kanter and his team a final chance to spell out measures that they believe are needed to restore competition in search. It comes six weeks after Justice first floated the idea of a breakup in a preliminary outline of potential penalties.",
      "But Kanter's proposal is already raising questions about whether regulators seek to impose controls that extend beyond the issues covered in last year's trial, and \u2014 by extension \u2014 Mehta's ruling.",
      "Banning the default search deals that Google now pays more than $26 billion annually to maintain was one of the main practices that troubled Mehta in his ruling.",
      "It's less clear whether the judge will embrace the Justice Department's contention that Chrome needs to be spun out of Google and Android should be unbundled from the company's other services.",
      "Trying to break up Google harks back to a similar punishment initially imposed on Microsoft a quarter century ago following another major antitrust trial that culminated in a federal judge deciding the software maker had illegally used his Windows operating system for PCs to stifle competition.",
      "However, an appeals court overturned an order that would have broken up Microsoft, a precedent many experts believe will make Mehta reluctant to go down a similar road with the Google case.",

    "story": [
      "The Food and Drug Administration said Wednesday that the U.S. food supply is still \"one of the safest in the world,\" in the wake of a number of foodborne disease outbreaks affecting items ranging from organic carrots to deli meats to McDonald's Quarter Pounders. E. coli, listeria and other contaminants have sickened thousands of people and forced a number of recalls in recent months.",
      "But despite those high-profile examples, data cited by the FDA suggest recalls were not unusually high this past year.",
      "For the fiscal year that ended in September, there were 179 recalls deemed by the agency's food and cosmetics arm as being for the highest-risk classification of issues, like potential contamination with bacteria or undeclared allergens.",
      "That's up from 145 high-risk recalls in 2023, but less than the 185 the agency recorded in 2022. There were 167 high-risk recalls in 2019.",
      "This classification includes the recall of tens of thousands of cases of onions processed by Taylor Farms that were pulled earlier this fall, after officials suspected they were to blame for a deadly E. coli outbreak linked to McDonald's Quarter Pounder burgers that has sickened more than a hundred people.",
      "\"Our ultimate goal is for industry to do their part to ensure that the foods they introduce into the market are not adulterated or misbranded. Recalls help get the food off the market quickly when something goes wrong. Outbreak advisories provide important food safety information to the public,\" an FDA spokesperson said in a statement.",
      "The spokesperson also pointed to The Economist's report measuring global food security. The U.S. food supply is \"one of the safest in the world\" and ranked \"joint first for the food safety indicator in 2022,\" the spokesperson said.",
      "In fact, the FDA suggested, the number of recalls is an indicator that the safety system is working.",
      "\"The occurrence of recalls and outbreaks means that manufacturers, importers and distributors are monitoring for issues and taking action when they detect a problem,\" the FDA spokesperson said.",
      "An increase in illnesses in CDC data \u2014 but also an increase in testing",
      "Figures from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suggest the number of high-profile recalls have increased from last year, though not by much.",
      "So far this year, 10 \"multistate foodborne outbreak notices\" have been issued by the CDC. Last year there were nine notices. There were 24 notices issued in 2018, the most of any year over the past decade.",
      "Infections from foodborne outbreak culprits like Shiga toxin-producing E. coli, or STEC, have climbed to at least 13,962 this year, CDC records tally.",
      "Around 13,140 had been reported by health departments around this time last year and 12,119 were reported by this time in 2019.",
      "Foodborne illnesses linked to other germs have also climbed across the country in recent years, reports by the CDC's FoodNet system suggest, though improvements in how patients are tested for these germs may help explain some of the increase.",
      "\"Laboratory technology changes and that impacts what we see in the surveillance data. When laboratory testing gets faster, it gets more specific, it gets better in other ways. It makes the data a little bit less comparable,\" Sharon Shea, senior director of food safety at the Association for Public Health Laboratories, told CBS News.",
      "Shea, who has also worked as a microbiologist in hospital laboratories as well as public health labs, said other ways that public health departments and doctors respond to foodborne outbreaks have gotten better as well.",
      "Some of that is a time-saving shift towards \"molecular-based\" panel tests that can be run by hospitals and clinical labs for an array of germs, instead of one-off tests for specific pathogens, that were rolled out after 2012.",
      "Labs in the PulseNet network helmed by the CDC have also switched to \"whole genome sequencing,\" Shea said \u2014 a more accurate approach to narrowing down the unique genetic fingerprint that can link different cases together for investigators. Those connections can be crucial for uncovering common foods eaten by sick people in an outbreak.",
      "\"The most preventable, needless deaths\"",
      "Food safety advocates outside the government say the U.S. still has plenty of room for improvement in food safety.",
      "\"It doesn't help to say 'Americans have the safest food in the world' when people are dying from baby carrots,\" said Sarah Sorscher, head of regulatory affairs at the Center for Science in the Public Interest.",

They have also criticized the agency for not requiring testing of irrigation water sprayed on crops, which can pose a contamination risk from nearby animal feeding operations.",

    "published": "Wed, 20 Nov 2024 15:10:17 -0500",
    "summary": "Some voters are hoping President-elect Donald Trump may send out another stimulus check. Here's what the experts say.",
    "story": [
      "President-elect Donald Trump in his first term as president sent out two stimulus checks to millions of Americans during the pandemic, part of the federal government's goal of keeping consumers financially afloat during the crisis. Now, some social media posts are claiming that Trump, once he takes office next year, may issue another check \u2014 a likelihood that experts say is extremely slim.",
      "Posts on TikTok are suggesting Trump might issue another round of checks, while on X, some users are questioning if they're in line for a payment.",
      "When the COVID-19 health emergency shuttered the economy in 2020, millions of Americans lost their jobs, sending the jobless rate to almost 15% and causing financial hardship for many. As a result, Trump signed two bills that sent stimulus checks to eligible households, while President Biden authorized a third.",
      "Even though many Americans feel the economy is faring badly, with some pointing to the impact of the pandemic's high inflation, the U.S. isn't anywhere close to the situation of the early 2020s, economists say.",
      "\"Stimulus checks typically only happen when the economy is in really bad shape and consumers need a push to start spending money again,\" LendingTree senior economist Jacob Channel told CBS MoneyWatch. \"That's not really the case in the present.\"",
      "Is the economy bad enough for a new stimulus check?",
      "While a majority of Americans give the economy poor ratings, economists say that it's in good shape overall, with solid GDP growth, inflation that is inching closer to the Federal Reserve's 2% annual goal and a jobless rate of 4.1% \u2014 which is near a 50-year low.",
      "\"Despite some pain points and general 'bad vibes' expressed by some people, the economy is currently in remarkably good shape and consumer spending is relatively strong,\" Channel said.",
      "Even so, many inflation-weary consumers say they haven't yet seen the benefit of that growth. The November 5 presidential election was viewed as a mandate from voters for a new economic direction.",
      "Could Trump issue a stimulus check?",
      "While some consumers might believe that Trump or Biden alone was responsible for sending out stimulus checks \u2014 perhaps because Trump put his name on the memo line of the first check \u2014 the payments were part of three bills passed by Congress, which were then sent to the sitting president for his signature.",
      "\"A president can't unilaterally issue stimulus checks, and the ones sent out during his last administration were largely the result of a push from Democrats in the House and Senate,\" Channel noted. \"Though Trump ultimately did sign the bill that sent stimulus checks to Americans, he isn't solely responsible for them.\"",
      "In other words, there would first need to be legislation passed by Congress to authorize another stimulus check, something that currently isn't on the horizon.",
      "Would a stimulus check impact inflation?",
      "With the Federal Reserve still aiming to pare inflation to a 2% annual rate \u2014 it stood at 2.6% last month \u2014 policymakers are likely to be cautious about any actions that could reignite inflation. Some economists have pointed to the surge in federal spending during the pandemic as\u00a0helping to create the conditions that led to the hottest inflation in 40 years.",
      "\"Because inflation is still such a big concern at the moment, the last thing a reasonable government would want to do is further stimulate consumer demand with stimulus checks because doing so would unnecessarily risk causing a resurgence in inflation,\" Channel noted.",
      "That being said, Trump's economic policies, including adding tariffs to imports and deporting millions of undocumented immigrants, could cause an inflation bump of as much of 1 percentage point, economists have said. That would push inflation to a range of about 3.6%, which Wall Street cautions could cause the Fed to hold off on further rate cuts.",
      "Could the IRS issue stimulus checks in 2024?",
      "The IRS sent the three rounds of pandemic stimulus checks after they were authorized by Congress and signed into law by Trump and Biden. In other words, without Congress' approval, the IRS won't be sending any stimulus checks in 2024.",
      "Currently there is no legislation in the works for stimulus spending, and such legislation is also considered extremely unlikely to occur in 2025. Instead, Trump and Republican lawmakers are likely to focus on tax legislation to extend the tax cuts in his 2017 Tax Cuts & Jobs Act, as well as tackling other spending issues, experts say.",

      "Thanksgiving dinner ingredients will cost more this year compared with last, even as food inflation cools. Fortunately, there's one simple way to save money without skimping on staple dishes for the food-driven holiday: store brands.",
      "Buying store-brand items versus national brand products is an age-old technique for saving money. And although there are instances of store-brand goods costing more than their name-brand counterparts, they can still save consumers money overall, new research from Wells Fargo\u00a0shows.",
      "How much can I save on store brands?",
      "\"Food inflation has slowed dramatically, but it's still not cheaper than a year ago, so that's a bone of contention from consumers,\" Wells Fargo chief agricultural economist Dr. Michael Swanson told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Still, grocery stores can undercut national brand prices by selling their own version of products from tissues to baked beans. Stores allege their products are equally good, but because they don't market them, they can sell them at a relative discount.",
      "\"The whole premise is that store brand represents a value to you. What store brand is supposed to bring is the same quality, same product, without all the marketing,\" Swanson said. \"Brands explain why you should eat theirs and not someone else's, whereas stores don't spend money and are supposed to pass the savings along to us, the consumers.\"",
      "This year, a store-brand Thanksgiving menu for 10 people, including turkey, stuffing, salad, cranberries, dinner rolls and pumpkin pie will cost consumers $73. That same menu made with name-brand products, will cost $90 this year, or $17 more, according to the Wells Fargo report.",
      "The $73 price tag is up 2.7% from last year.",
      "Keep your eye on all items \u2014 not just the turkey",
      "Grocers tend to run promotions on turkeys around Thanksgiving, given that they're such a seasonal purchase \u2014 the two-week window before the Thanksgiving holiday is when grocers make the bulk of their whole turkey sales.",
      "But buyers beware: Some retailers can lure you into the store with a deal on a turkey, only to sell you other items at high prices.",
      "\"Retailers will feature discounts on turkey to get you into store so that, while you're there, you'll pick up everything else,\" Swanson said. \"Make sure you don't just go in for the turkey and not pay attention to prices of other things on the shopping list, which can add up to a lot of money.\"",
      "Store-brand stuffing mixes are still priced high, but are an opportunity for savings nevertheless. Name-brand stuffing is up 9% compared with the same period last year, and store-brand stuffing is up 3%.",
      "Cranberries are an outlier this season. It's a category in which the name-brand product is priced lower than the store-brand alternative. A 12-ounce bag of name-brand fresh cranberries is down 3% compared with 2023, while the same-size bag of store-brand cranberries is up 6%.",

Personal bankruptcies were up\u00a016% in October from a year ago, as more Americans are seeking debt relief. But those struggling to stay financially afloat should consider the option sooner rather than later, advise experts who study when and why people file.",
      "\"When a consumer feels financial pressure, the last thing on their mind is seeking bankruptcy protection,\" said Michael Hunter, vice president, business development, at Epiq Aacer, a provider of bankruptcy information and partner to the American Bankruptcy Institute, or ABI. Most people don't file until 18 to 24 months after they've incurred financial hardship, Hunter said.",
      "Researchers, over decades of interviewing thousands of people who've declared personal bankruptcy, have found that about two-thirds of individual filers struggle with paying their debts for up to five years before seeking help.",
      "\"The common response is people are struggling with their debt for more than two years\" before seeking a legal remedy, Robert Lawless, a professor at the University of Illinois College of Law, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"People misunderstand bankruptcy and wait too long to see a bankruptcy lawyer. Most people would benefit by going earlier,\" said Lawless, a co-principal investigator in the Consumer Bankruptcy\u00a0Project, launched in 1981 by a group of academics including Senator Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., a law school professor at the time.",
      "When to file for bankruptcy",
      "Because of the stigma and shame that Americans attach to bankruptcy, people turn to it as a last resort \u2014 oftentimes after they have plowed through retirement funds and other assets that would be have been shielded from creditors by filing for debt relief.",
      "\"If you are raiding pension or other retirement assets, that is a red flag,\" said Lawless, noting those funds are protected from creditors in bankruptcy. Borrowing money to cover current expenses is another warning sign, he offered.",
      "\"It makes sense to file if a creditor is going to be able to take away something you need,\" said Pamela Foohey, a professor of law at the University of Georgia School of Law in Athens. \"If a person is dealing with a wage garnishment that is harming their lives, or if a lender is threatening to repossess your car. If there's no other way to get a car that will fit your budget, filing could be a way to keep your car, or keep your house.\"",
      "Otherwise the broad answer is to first address how they might solve the cause of their financial distress before filing for bankruptcy. \"It doesn't help to find a better-paying job if after bankruptcy more is going out than coming in,\" said Lawless.",
      "\"If you lost your job, file after you found a new job; if you have a health crisis, you file after you've gotten better to discharge all of the medical debt that you've racked up,\" said Foohey.",
      "If someone undergoes a change in their family situation, whether it's a divorce or the birth of twins, she advises that they first figure out how they're going to manage going forward on a budget\u00a0after the debt is discharged.",
      "\"Bankruptcy does one thing, it gets rid of debt. It doesn't find you a job, it doesn't put money in your pocket,\" said Lawless.",
      "Also, legally speaking, once debt is discharged or a financial repayment plan is approved by a judge, it will be another 5 to 8 years before one can file again.",
      "Chapter 7 versus Chapter 13",
      "It costs about $1,500 to file Chapter 7, and most attorneys require that their fees be paid upfront. Chapter 7 is a liquidation bankruptcy, where one's nonexempt property and assets \u2014 possessions not protected by bankruptcy \u2014 are turned over to a trustee, and debt is discharged in 3 to 6 months. According to Lawless, 95% of Chapter 7 don't have any assets to turn over.",
      "With a Chapter 13, payments can be spread out, however the overall cost is a lot more.",
      "Having to hire and pay an attorney several thousands dollars is also a daunting prospect for those in financial turmoil, but Lawless said a lawyer is a better option than filing for bankruptcy yourself or looking to consumer credit counseling \u2014 a service that is typically for-profit and has a long history of problems.",
      "\"In Chapter 13, attorneys can allow for nothing upfront, put all their fees in the repayment plan, and on average charge $4,500,\" Foohey said.",
      "According to Foohey, only about a third of those who file Chapter 13 make it to the end and have their debts discharged. \"Not everyone wants the discharge, but to reset their relationship with their mortgage holder,\" she said.",
      "A Chapter 13 involves committing to a 3- to 5-year repayment plan. However, many filers that enter the agreements don't complete them, Lawless relayed. \"Homeowners will file 13 so they don't lose their home. It's among the tools used to get caught up on mortgage payments,\" he said.",
      "Attorneys charge far less for Chapter 7, as it's a less-complicated process than a Chapter 13. The latter is used for, but a bad idea, to pay for one's bankruptcy.",
      "\"In 7, you have to pay for your bankruptcy upfront. In Chapter 13 you pay your attorney in that 3- to 5-year plan,\" said Lawless. \"If you're using 13 to pay your attorney feels that is generally the wrong choice.\"",
      "In Lawless' view, \"the number one thing Congress should do is make it possible to pay your Chapter 7 attorney over time, so we don't have people filing Chapter 13 when they don't need to.\"",
      "Return to pre-COVID numbers",
      "Personal bankruptcy filings averaged about 750,000 a year before COVID-19, but dropped off a cliff during the pandemic, thanks to government aid.",
      "\"It was very consistent from 2014 to 2019 \u2014 pretty flat, and then the pandemic hit. A lot of us thought volumes would surge,\" said Epiq's Hunter. But there was forbearance for student loans, cars and mortgages, he noted.",
      "\"Banks were extending olive branches, and we saw bankruptcies plummet to less than half of pre-pandemic levels,\" he said.",
      "\"There was a lot of money sloshing around,\" said Lawless, citing government stimulus programs and other aid. \"People paid down their debt,\" he stated.",
      "Now, with those financial lifelines largely unplugged, U.S. households are tacking more debt onto household balance sheets. \"The biggest surprise is bankruptcy filings haven't gone up even more,\" said Lawless, who expects a return to pre-COVID levels.",
      "Nonbusiness bankruptcy filings fell to under 400,000 before edging back up to 434,000 in 2023, according to statistics published by the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts. With two months left in 2024, personal bankruptcy filings stood at 405,132 at the end of October.",
      "\"We're still pretty far away from the filing numbers of 2019,\" said Foohey. \"There was a drastic drop at the time of the pandemic that continued for several years, which is now returning to pre-pandemic levels.\"",

      "President-elect Donald Trump says he'll nominate Howard Lutnick, head of brokerage and investment bank Cantor Fitzgerald, to be commerce secretary, a position in which he'd have a key role in carrying out Trump's plans to raise and enforce tariffs.",
      "Trump announced his pick Tuesday in a social media post.",
      "Lutnick is a co-chair of Trump's transition team, along with Linda McMahon, the former wrestling executive who was the Small Business Administration administrator in Trump's first administration. Both are tasked with putting forward candidates for key roles in the next administration.",
      "Lutnick has also donated millions to the effort to re-elect Trump and other Republicans. He hosted a fundraiser for Trump in August that raised $15 million and also gave $5 million to the Make America Great Again PAC, according to Federal Election Commission records.",
      "As commerce secretary, Lutnick, if confirmed, would be in charge of a sprawling Cabinet agency that is involved in funding new computer chip factories, imposing trade restrictions, releasing economic data and monitoring the weather. It is also a position in which connections to CEOs and the wider business community are crucial.",
      "An advocate for imposing wide-ranging tariffs, Lutnick told CNBC in September that \"tariffs are an amazing tool for the president to use \u2014 we need to protect the American worker.\" During his campaign, Trump proposed a 60% tariff on goods from China \u2014 and a tariff of up to 20% on everything else the U.S. imports.",
      "\"I think we'll make a bunch of money on the tariffs,\" Lutnick said, \"but mostly, everybody else is going to negotiate with us, and we will be more fair.\"",
      "Mainstream economists are generally skeptical of tariffs, considering them a mostly inefficient way for governments to raise money and promote prosperity.",
      "During the campaign, Trump campaign allies, including Lutnick, were asked about Project 2025, the\u00a0multi-pronged initiative\u00a0overseen by the conservative Heritage Foundation that includes a detailed\u00a0blueprint\u00a0for the next Republican president to usher in a sweeping overhaul of the executive branch.",
      "Trump and his campaign worked to distance themselves from Project 2025 in the months leading up to Election Day, with the former president going so far as to call some of the proposals \"abysmal.\" Lutnick told CNBC he had read Project 2025 but had not met with any of its authors.",
      "\"I won't touch them. They made themselves nuclear,\" Lutnick said in September.",
      "Lutnick, who's worked on Wall Street for over 30 years, has been with Cantor Fitzgerald since 1983 and became its president and CEO when he was 29 years old, in 1996. On 9/11, Cantor Fitzgerald lost about two-thirds of its New York-based workforce in the terrorist attacks, 658 employees in all, including Lutnick's brother. Lutnick survived the attack because he was late to work that day, dropping off his young son at his first day of school. In the years since the attack, Lutnick and the Cantor Fitzgerald Relief Fund have donated $180 million to 9/11 families, according to Trump's social media post on Lutnick's selection.",
      "Lutnick, who is also a cryptocurrency enthusiast, was also under consideration for treasury secretary, a role that has been at the center of high-profile jockeying within the Trump world. At the same time, the treasury position is closely watched in financial circles, where a disruptive nominee could have immediate negative consequences on the stock market, which Trump watches closely.",
      "Billionaire Elon Musk and others in Trump's orbit were calling on Trump to dump the previous front-runner for treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, in favor of Lutnick. Musk said in his post that \"Bessent is a business-as-usual choice, whereas @howardlutnick will actually enact change.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 19 Nov 2024 18:09:55 -0500",
    "summary": "Brendan Carr wrote Project 2025's chapter on overhauling the Federal Communications Commission. Here's what to know.",
    "story": [
      "President-elect Donald Trump's pick to run the Federal Communications Commission, Brendan Carr, will oversee the agency that regulates U.S. internet access and communications networks such as TV and radio. Carr believes it's an institution ripe for change,\u00a0 according to the chapter he wrote in Project 2025 about the FCC.",
      "Carr will be stepping into the role of FCC Chair after serving as one of its five commissioners since 2017, when Trump nominated him to the role during his first administration. Prior to that, Carr served as the agency's general counsel.",
      "The FCC may not be a household name to most Americans, but the agency enforces communications laws, runs programs to help communities gain access to high-speed internet and regulates communications services, including satellite internet access, among other tasks. But under Carr, the agency may pivot to some new priorities during Trump's next term, with a renewed focus on battling big technology companies and Chinese-based telecom firms.",
      "\"The FCC needs to change course and bring new urgency to achieving four main goals,\" including \"reining in Big Tech,\" Carr wrote in his chapter on the FCC in Project 2025, a policy blueprint published by the Heritage Foundation.",
      "Here's what to know about Carr's priorities.",
      "How might the FCC deal with tech giants?",
      "In Project 2025, Carr highlighted what he believes is a need for a new approach to dealing with tech giants such as Google, Meta and others.",
      "\"Today, a handful of corporations can shape everything from the information we consume to the places we shop,\" Carr wrote in the document. \"These corporate behemoths are not merely exercising market power, they are abusing dominant positions.\"",
      "The FCC should restrict immunity from Section 230, part of a law that says tech companies aren't liable if a user posts something libelous, as well as tamp down the businesses' ability to \"censor protected speech while maintaining their Section 230 protections,\" he wrote.",
      "Carr also wants tech companies to be more transparent about their algorithm changes and their decisions to block or demonetize users.",
      "What are Carr's views on Elon Musk?",
      "Carr has built an alliance with billionaire Musk, the world's wealthiest person who backed Trump's campaign and whose Starlink satellite internet service could benefit from access to federal cash.",
      "In a Tuesday interview with Fox News, Carr pointed to Musk as an example of how the federal government doesn't treat people fairly, noting that a grant of almost $900 million to Musk's Starlink was \"revoked unlawfully.\" Last year, the FCC said it rejected the grant because of lack of proof that Starlink would be able to provide service to hundreds of thousands of rural properties.",
      "\"It is time for the American government to not give people different treatment based on their last name,\" Carr told Fox News. \"Everybody will get a fair shake from the government going forward.\"",
      "What about his views on TikTok and Chinese businesses?",
      "In his Project 2025 chapter, Carr singled out TikTok and other Chinese-owned businesses as potential threats to U.S. security.",
      "\"As law enforcement officials have made clear, TikTok poses a serious and unacceptable risk to America's national security,\" Carr wrote. \"It also provides Beijing with an opportunity to run a foreign influence campaign by determining the news and information that the app feeds to millions of Americans.\"",
      "That would align his views along those with the Biden administration, with the president\u00a0signing a law in April that would require TikTok to be sold or else banned from the U.S.",
      "Carr also wrote that he believes the FCC needs to do more to monitor and restrict Chinese telecom and tech businesses from operating within the U.S.",
      "What does Carr say about broadcasters?",
      "Carr has taken aim at some broadcasters, including CBS News, echoing Trump's claims that they engage in political bias. For instance, Carr singled out NBC for including Trump's Democratic rival, Kamala Harris, in a \"Saturday Night Live\" skit before the election.",
      "\"This is a clear and blatant effort to evade the FCC's Equal Time rule,\" Carr wrote on X on November 2. \"The purpose of the rule is to avoid exactly this type of biased and partisan conduct \u2014 a licensed broadcaster using the public airwaves to exert its influence for one candidate on the eve of an election.\"",
      "After Trump announced Carr's pick, Carr said on X that he will ensure the FCC \"will enforce\" laws that call on broadcasters \"to operate in the public interest.\"",
      "Trump has repeatedly called to strip major broadcasters such as ABC, NBC and CBS of their licenses. During the 2024 campaign, Trump\u00a0sued CBS News\u00a0over a \"60 Minutes\" interview with Harris, alleging the network used \"deceitful\" editing of her responses. CBS News has called the president-elect's claims \"completely without merit\" and added it intended to vigorously defend against the lawsuit.",
      "What do supporters and critics say about Carr?",
      "Trump praised Carr as \"a warrior for Free Speech\" in a statement announcing his selection. Fellow FCC Commissioner Geoffrey Starks, a Democrat, described Carr as \"a dedicated public servant and a recognized leader on the many issues before the Commission today.\"",
      "But some critics have flagged some of Carr's stances, with the nonpartisan public interest group Free Press describing his relationship with Musk as well as his stance on broadcasters as problematic.",
      "\"While styling himself as a free-speech champion, Carr refused to stand up when Trump threatened to take away the broadcast licenses of TV stations for daring to fact check him during the campaign,\" Free Press Action Co-CEO Craig Aaron said in a statement. \"This alone should be disqualifying.\"",
      "Free Press and Fight for the Future, an advocacy group focused on digital rights, both have cited concerns about net neutrality, a policy that ensures internet service providers treat all websites and online content equally. Net neutrality was overturned during the first Trump administration, but was restored during Biden's term.",
      "\"Trump's nomination of Brendan Carr, one of the co-authors of Project 2025, to head the FCC is more than just a reversal of popular policies like net neutrality,\" said Evan Greer, director of Fight for the Future, said in an email. \"Carr has made clear he actually wants the FCC to get more involved in policing online speech.\"",

Additionally, the IRS provides services through its Free File program for those who made an adjusted gross income of $79,000 or less.",
      "More than 100,000 taxpayers used the new Direct File program to file their taxes this year, which marked the first time the system was in operation, according to the Treasury Department.",

    "published": "Tue, 19 Nov 2024 09:45:29 -0500",
    "summary": "Arthur Frommer, whose \"Europe on 5 Dollars a Day\" guidebooks revolutionized leisure travel by persuading average Americans to take budget vacations abroad, has died. He was 95.",
    "story": [
      "New York \u2014\u00a0 Arthur Frommer, whose \"Europe on 5 Dollars a Day\" guidebooks revolutionized leisure travel by persuading average Americans to take budget vacations abroad, has died. He was 95.",
      "Frommer died from complications of pneumonia, his daughter Pauline Frommer said Monday.",
      "\"My father opened up the world to so many people,\" she said. \"He believed deeply that travel could be an enlightening activity and one that did not require a big budget.\"",
      "Frommer began writing about travel while serving in the U.S. Army in Europe in the 1950s. When a guidebook he wrote for American soldiers overseas sold out, he launched what became one of the travel industry's best-known brands, self-publishing \"Europe on 5 Dollars a Day\" in 1957.",
      "\"It struck a chord and became an immediate best-seller,\" he recalled in an interview with The Associated Press in 2007, on the 50th anniversary of the book's debut.",
      "The Frommer's brand, led today by Pauline Frommer, remains one of the best-known names in the travel industry, with guidebooks to destinations around the world, an influential social media presence, podcasts and a radio show.",
      "Frommer's philosophy - stay in inns and budget hotels instead of five-star hotels, sightsee on your own using public transportation, eat with locals in small cafes instead of fancy restaurants - changed the way Americans traveled in the mid- to late 20th century. He said budget travel was preferable to luxury travel \"because it leads to a more authentic experience.\" That message encouraged average people, not just the wealthy, to vacation abroad.",
      "It didn't hurt that his books hit the market as the rise of jet travel made getting to Europe easier than crossing the Atlantic by ship.",
      "The books became so popular that there was a time when you couldn't visit a place like the Eiffel Tower without spotting Frommer's guidebooks in the hands of every other American tourist.",
      "Frommer's advice also became so standard that it's hard to remember how radical it seemed in the days before discount flights and backpacks.",
      "\"It was really pioneering stuff,\" Tony Wheeler, founder of the Lonely Planet guidebook company, said in an interview in 2013. Before Frommer, Wheeler said, you could find guidebooks \"that would tell you everything about the church or the temple ruin. But the idea that you wanted to eat somewhere and find a hotel or get from A to B -- well, I've got a huge amount of respect for Arthur.\"",
      "\"Arthur did for travel what Consumer Reports did for everything else,\" said Pat Carrier, former owner of The Globe Corner, a travel bookstore in Cambridge, Massachusetts.",
      "The final editions of Frommer's groundbreaking series were titled \"Europe from $95 a Day.\"",
      "Frommer guides reborn",
      "The concept no longer made sense when hotels couldn't be had for less than $100 a night, so the series was discontinued in 2007. But the Frommer publishing empire didn't disappear, despite a series of sales that started when Frommer sold the guidebook company to Simon & Schuster. It was later acquired by Wiley Publishing, which in turn sold it to Google in 2012. Google quietly shut the guidebooks down, but Arthur Frommer - in a David vs. Goliath triumph - got his brand back from Google. In November 2013 with his daughter Pauline, he relaunched the print series with dozens of new guidebook titles.",
      "\"I never dreamed at my age I'd be working this hard,\" he told the AP at the time, age 84.",
      "Frommer also remained a well-known figure in 21st century travel, opinionated to the end of his career, speaking out on his blog and radio show.",
      "He hated mega-cruise ships and railed against travel websites where consumers put up their own reviews, saying they were too easily manipulated with phony posts. And he coined the phrase \"Trump Slump\" in a widely quoted column that predicted a slump in tourism to the U.S. after Donald Trump was elected president the first time.",
      "Depression-era roots",
      "Frommer was born in Lynchburg, Virginia, and grew up during the Great Depression in Jefferson City, Missouri, the child of a Polish father and Austrian mother. \"My father had one job after another, one company after another that went bankrupt,\" he recalled. The family moved to New York when he was a teenager. He worked as an office boy at Newsweek, went to New York University and was drafted upon graduating from Yale Law School in 1953. Because he spoke French and Russian, he was sent to work in Army intelligence at a U.S. base in Germany, where the Cold War was heating up.",
      "His first glimpse of Europe was from the window of a military transport plane. Whenever he had a weekend leave or a three-day pass, he'd hop a train to Paris or hitch a ride to England on an Air Force flight.",
      "Eventually, he wrote \"The GI's Guide to Traveling in Europe\" and, a few weeks before his Army stint was up, he had 5,000 copies printed by a typesetter in a German village. They were priced at 50 cents apiece and distributed by the Army newspaper, Stars & Stripes.",
      "Shortly after he returned to New York to practice law at the firm Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison, he received a cable from Europe. \"The book was sold out, would I arrange a reprint?\" he said.",
      "Soon after, he spent his month's vacation from the law firm doing a civilian version of the guide. \"In 30 days I went to 15 different cities, getting up at 4 a.m., running up and down the streets, trying to find good cheap hotels and restaurants,\" he recalled.",
      "The resulting book, the very first \"Europe on 5 Dollars a Day,\" was much more than a list. It was written with a wide-eyed wonder that verged on poetry: \"Venice is a fantastic dream,\" Frommer wrote. \"Try to arrive at night when the wonders of the city can steal upon you piecemeal and slow. ... Out of the dark, there appear little clusters of candy-striped mooring poles; a gondola approaches with a lighted lantern hung from its prow.\"",
      "Frommer eventually gave up law to write the guides full-time.",
      "Daughter Pauline joined him with his first wife, Hope Arthur, on their trips starting in 1965, when she was 4 months old. \"They used to joke that the book should be called 'Europe on Five Diapers a Day,'\" Pauline Frommer said.",
      "In the 1960s, when inflation forced Frommer to change the title of the book to \"Europe on 5 and 10 Dollars a Day,\" he said \"it was as if someone had plunged a knife into my head.\"",
      "Dispelling false impressions",
      "Asked to summarize the impact of his books in a 2017 Associated Press interview, he said that in the 1950s, \"most Americans had been taught that foreign travel was a once-in-a-lifetime experience, especially travel to Europe. They were taught that they were going to a war-torn country where it was risky to stay in any hotel other than a five-star hotel. It was risky to go into anything but a top-notch restaurant. ... And I knew that all these warnings were a lot of nonsense.\"",
      "He added: \"We were pioneers in also suggesting that a different type of American should travel, that you didn't have to be well-heeled.\"",
      "To the end of his life, he said he avoided traveling first class. \"I fly economy class and I try to experience the same form of travel, the same experience that the average American and the average citizen of the world encounters,\" he said.",
      "As Frommer aged, his daughter Pauline gradually became the force behind the company, promoting the brand, managing the business and even writing some of the content based on her own travels. Her relationship with her father was both tender and respectful, and she summed it up this way in a 2012 email to AP: \"It's wonderful to have a working partner whose mind is a steel trap and who doesn't just have smarts, but wisdom. His opinions, whether or not you agree with them, come from his social values. He's a man who puts ethics at the center of his life, and weaves them into everything he does.\"",
      "In addition to Pauline, Frommer's survivors include his second wife, Roberta Brodfeld, and four grandchildren.",

      "Spirit has entered into a restructuring agreement\u00a0with its bondholders in order to reduce the airline's debt and provide it with increased financial flexibility, Spirit said in an open letter to customers Monday. The longterm aim, Spirit said, is to provide its guests \"with enhanced travel experiences and greater value.\"",
      "The airline, known for its bargain fares, said it expects to emerge from bankruptcy in the first quarter of 2025, \"even better positioned to deliver the best value in the sky.\"",
      "Industry experts attribute Spirit's financial woes in part to changing consumer preferences as they\u00a0demand more amenities while flying.",
      "\"We can clearly see that consumer preferences have changed in favor of a more premium product, and the low-cost airlines are struggling,\" Jungho Suh, management professor at George Washington University School of Business told CBS MoneyWatch. \"They don't want to see any added costs, they want an all-in, full-service offering.\"",
      "What if I am booked on a Spirit flight?",
      "Spirit plainly states that customers with existing reservations can still use their tickets. Their flight credits and loyalty points are also still valid, and can be redeemed as usual. Customers may also make new reservations for future travel.",
      "\"The most important thing to know is that you can continue to book and fly now and in the future,\" the airline said.",

      "Spirit Airlines said Monday that it's filed for bankruptcy protection and will attempt to reboot as it struggles to recover from the pandemic-caused swoon in travel and failed attempts to sell itself to other carriers.",
      "Spirit, the biggest U.S. budget airline, has lost more than $2.5 billion since the start of 2020 and faces looming debt payments totaling more than $1 billion over the next year, obligations it was unlikely to be able to meet.",
      "The move was widely expected.",

      "The Chapter 11 process itself won't impact Spirit employee's wages or benefits, the airline said.",
      "Shares of Miramar, Florida-based Spirit dropped 25% on Friday after The Wall Street Journal reported that the airline was discussing terms of a possible bankruptcy filing with its bondholders. It was just the latest in a series of blows that have sent the stock crashing down by 97% since late 2018 \u2014 when Spirit was still making money.",
      "CEO Ted Christie confirmed in August that Spirit was talking to advisers of its bondholders about the upcoming debt maturities. He called the discussions a priority and said the airline was trying to get the best deal it could as quickly as possible.",
      "\"The chatter in the market about Spirit is notable, but we are not distracted,\" he told investors during an earnings call. \"We are focused on refinancing our debt, improving our overall liquidity position, deploying our new reimagined product into the market, and growing our loyalty programs.\"",
      "People are still flying on Spirit Airlines. They're just not paying as much.",
      "In the first six months of this year, Spirit passengers flew 2% more than they did in the same period last year. However, they're paying 10% less per mile, and revenue per mile from fares is down nearly 20%, contributing to Spirit's red ink.",
      "It's not a new trend. Spirit failed to return to profitability when the coronavirus pandemic eased and travel rebounded.",
      "What's been ailing Spirit",
      "There are several reasons behind the slump.",
      "Spirit's costs, especially for labor, have risen. The biggest U.S. airlines have snagged some of Spirit's budget-conscious customers by offering their own brand of bare-bones tickets. And fares for U.S. leisure travel \u2014 Spirit's core business \u2014 have sagged because of a glut of new flights.",
      "The premium end of the air-travel market has surged while Spirit's traditional no-frills end has stagnated. So this summer, Spirit decided to sell bundled fares that include a bigger seat, priority boarding, free bags, internet service and snacks and drinks. That was a huge change from Spirit's longtime strategy of luring customers with rock-bottom fares and forcing them to pay extra for things such as bringing a carry-on bag or ordering a soda.",
      "Airline industry analyst Henry Harteveldt pointed out to CBS News that, on one hand, some people \"are saying, 'You know what? I'm doing better than I thought financially and I can afford maybe to upgrade to an airline that has extra leg room or something like that.' And Spirit has missed that opportunity.\"",
      "On the other hand, Harteveldt notes, lots of Spirit's customers \"haven't been able to afford to fly to the same extent that they used to because of the higher cost of everyday living.\"",
      "In a highly unusual move, Spirit plans to cut its October-through-December schedule by nearly 20% compared with the same period last year, which analysts say should help prop up fares. But that will help rivals more than it will boost Spirit. Analysts from Deutsche Bank and Raymond James say Frontier, JetBlue and Southwest would benefit the most because of their overlap with Spirit on many routes.",
      "Spirit has also been plagued by required repairs to Pratt & Whitney engines that are forcing the airline to ground dozens of its Airbus jets. Spirit has cited the recall as it furloughed pilots.",
      "Spirit said in an October regulatory filing that it had identified about $80 million of cost-cutting measures set to begin early next year, according to\u00a0CBS News Miami. Those cuts will be driven primarily by a \"reduction in workforce,\" the Florida-based airline noted. The carrier also disclosed that it had agreed to sell 23 airplanes to GA Telesis, an aviation services company, for about $519 million.",
      "Mergers didn't materialize",
      "The aircraft fleet is relatively young, which has made Spirit an attractive takeover target.",
      "Frontier Airlines tried to merge with Spirit in 2022 but was outbid by JetBlue. However, the Justice Department sued to block the $3.8 billion deal, saying it would drive up prices for Spirit customers who depend on low fares, and a federal judge agreed in January. JetBlue and Spirit dropped their merger two months later.",
      "U.S. airline bankruptcies were common in the 1990s and 2000s, as airlines struggled with fierce competition, high labor costs and sudden spikes in the price of jet fuel. PanAm, TWA, Northwest, Continental, United and Delta were swept up. Some liquidated, while others used favorable laws to renegotiate debts such as aircraft leases and keep flying.",
      "The last bankruptcy by a major U.S. carrier ended when American Airlines emerged from Chapter 11 protection and simultaneously merged with US Airways in December 2013.",

    "summary": "Canada's Bestar recalled wall beds only after learning of dozens of cases in which its beds detached from the walls, feds say.",
    "story": [
      "Canada's Bestar has agreed to a more than $16 million civil penalty for failing to report\u00a0a defect in its wall beds until after one person was killed and more than a dozen others injured, some seriously, federal officials say.",
      "Starting in September of 2014 and continuing through 2022, Bestar received numbers of reports that the products had detached from the wall. By 2016, the company was told of two cases in which people had been injured by the beds falling on them, according to a settlement agreement announced on Monday by the Consumer Product Safety Commission.",
      "The furniture company then engaged with CPSC and Health Canada, but did not tell regulators of an additional five incidents it had become aware of by that time, the document said. In 2018, a Bestar wall bed fell on an elderly woman, causing injuries that led to her hospitalization and death later that year.",
      "All told, Bestar was aware of 35 incidents in which its beds detached from walls and fell on people, resulting in the fatality and 15 injuries, some of which were serious, according the Consumer Product Safety Commission. Bestar knowingly failed to immediately report that its wall beds posed a serious impact and crushing hazard, as is required by law, the agency said Monday in a news release.",
      "The CPSC has agreed to suspend all but $4 million of the $16.025 penalty because paying more than that would cause the company to go out of business.",
      "Bestar and the commission announced a recall of the wall beds on April 7, 2022, warning consumers that a 79-year-old woman had died after a wall bed fell on her, injuring her spine. Bestar and the CPSC at that time stated the company had received reports of 60 additional incidents resulting in bruising and other injuries from the beds detaching and hitting people.",
      "About 129,000 of the wall beds were sold in the U.S. from June 2014 through March 2022 online at Amazon.com, Costco.com, Cymax.com and Wayfair.com. Bestar also sold roughly 53,000 of the wall beds in Canada.",
      "The commission explained the discrepancy between the lower number of incidents noted in its current press release and the higher case count in its 2020 recall as a matter of what the company had reported at specific times.",
      "\"Our penalty cases focus on when the firms reported to us; not the recall date. So, it is earlier in time; thus, fewer incidents,\" a CPSC spokesperson stated in an email.",
      "The settlement does not constitute an admission of guilt by Bestar to allegations including it knowingly broke the law, it said in the document. The company had not received \"substantiated claims\" that its beds had fallen on people so long as they were properly assembled and anchored to the wall.",
      "Bestar did not immediately respond to a request for further comment.",
      "Bestar purchased Bush Industries in 2020, with both brands now operating under a corporate parent, eSolutions Furniture Group, which was established in 2021 and is based in Sherbrooke, Quebec, Canada.

    "summary": "Mike Tyson, a boxing legend, and Jake Paul, a social media legend, threw down Friday in Dallas. Financially, they both came out winners.",
    "story": [
      "Jake Paul, a former child star and social media influencer who started boxing professionally in 2020, slugged it out with former heavyweight champion Mike Tyson on Friday in a matchup that was livestreamed worldwide on Netflix. Paul won the fight by unanimous decision.",
      "Here's what we know about how much Paul and Tyson were being paid, along with other financial aspects of an event that many consider more spectacle than sport.",
      "How much is Mike Tyson getting paid for the fight?",
      "Regarded as one of the greatest boxers of all time, 58-year-old Mike Tyson has an estimated net worth of $10 million, according to Celebrity Net Worth. That is a modest sum compared with the hundreds of millions of dollars \"Iron Mike,\" as he is known, accumulated in career earnings, including $400 million in fight purses, according\u00a0to\u00a0Forbes. Over the last decade, Tyson has also fought his way back after filing for bankruptcy in 2003.",
      "Though promotors did not reveal exactly how much Tyson earned for Friday's fight, reports from online sources,\u00a0including DraftKings Network, estimate he'll make around $20 million.",

      "Jake Paul, 27, to fight 57-year-old Mike Tyson live on Netflix: \"Time to put Iron Mike to sleep\"",
      "That's about the same dollar amount Tyson earned in his match against Michael Spinks in 1988, a record purse at the time (worth roughly $53 million today adjusting for inflation). That bout lasted less than two minutes, with Tyson knocking out the previously undefeated Spinks in 91 seconds.",
      "In 1992, Tyson was sent to prison for six years after being convicted of raping a teenage beauty-pageant contestant. He was released on parole after three and a half years, returning to boxing in 1995 in a match against Peter McNeely, who was dispatched by a technical knockout in under 90 seconds.",
      "Tyson would go on to earn $30 million for each of his next four matches, which included an infamous 1997 fight against Evander Holyfield in which Tyson bit off a piece of his opponent's right ear. Tyson was disqualified from the fight, had his boxing license revoked and fined $3 million, but was allowed to keep the purse.",
      "At a news conference on Wednesday, Paul wore a diamond-spiked ear cover, a pointed reference to the incident. But when it comes to making light of the ear biting, Tyson has beat Paul to the punch, having launched ear-shaped marijuana edibles\u00a0(with Holyfield's consent) through his company, Tyson 2.0, a premium cannabis brand he launched in 2021. The brand generated an estimated $150 million in revenue in 2023, according to Forbes Australia.",
      "How much is Jake Paul getting paid for the fight?",
      "Jake Paul, 27, is set to earn $40 million, according to an estimate from DraftKings Network and other sources \u2014 double what Tyson is expected to receive for the fight. A simple explanation for that may be that Paul, a top social influencer with 27 million followers on Instagram alone, is also co-founder of Most Valuable Promotions (MVP), the company promoting the extravaganza in partnership with Netflix. His net worth is estimated at $80 million, according to Celebrity Net Worth.",
      "With a 10-1 fight record, mostly against\u00a0mixed martial artists and other pro-boxing newcomers under his belt, Paul, a former child star and YouTube prankster who began his boxing career in 2018, does not lack confidence \u2014 or showmanship. His cocky attitude earned him his latest nickname \"El Gallo de Dorado\" or the Golden Rooster, coined by fans in Puerto Rico. Before that, he was called \"The Problem Child,\" a fairly self-explanatory moniker based on the online persona he's crafted for himself over the years.",
      "Paul, who went full Gallo at an open training session this week with Tyson at the Toyota Music Factory in Irving, Texas, donning a rooster hat and red-feathered skirt over his boxing trunks, epitomizes social media's melding of Barnumesque entertainment and sports.",
      "In a TikTok video posted Tuesday, a shirtless Paul, slumped on a couch wearing a prosthetic belly to make himself look out of shape, places stacks of money on his protruding stomach while offering \"Mikey, Mikey\" an additional $5 million if the former champion can last more than four rounds with him in the ring. If he doesn't, says Paul in the video, the aging boxer will have to get a tattoo that says \"I love Jake Paul.\"",
      "\"This is why modern boxing is a joke,\"commented one user on Reddit in reaction to the video. \"People get more excited about freak show fights than actual boxing matches.\"",

      "Tyson enters the ring on Friday, nearly 20 years since his last professional fight, as a +160 underdog,\u00a0according\u00a0to the latest betting odds from DraftKings. That means a $100 wager on post-retirement Iron Mike will bring in a $160 profit if he wins. At -200, Paul is the favorite to win. Bettors will have to place a $200 wager to make a $100 profit, should the social influencer prevail over Tyson.",
      "\"There has been a lot of anticipation for this fight, and we have been pleased with the betting volume,\" Johnny Avello, director of sports operations at DraftKings, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"We expect more action to come in the hours leading up to the fight.\"",
      "Although it remains to be seen how much will be wagered in total, the event is attracting some whale-sized bets of $500,000, according to ESPN.",
      "Gamblers are backing Tyson, according to DraftKings, with 69% of all bets currently on the former undisputed world champion to emerge victorious. \"While Tyson is 58-years old now, people see one of the greatest boxers of all time at a favorable price and jump at that opportunity,\" Avello said.",
      "\"While it won't match up to an event like the Super Bowl, it could certainly be our most bet boxing match of the year,\" he added.",
      "Not everyone will be able to place a bet the epic bout. Though the fight is sanctioned by Texas Department of Licensing and Regulation, changes in the rules, including\u00a0shorter rounds and bigger gloves, disqualifies the fight from being bet on in at least seven U.S.\u00a0states.",
      "How to watch the Jake Paul vs. Mike Tyson fight",
      "For most fans, the best seats will be at home, with Tyson vs. Paul streaming worldwide on Netflix. A standard Netflix subscription plan with ads is $6.99 a month. The platform's broadcast starts at 8 p.m. Eastern time.",
      "As reported by CBS Sports, the fight marks Netflix's biggest bet to date on live sports. Netflix, which has 282 million subscribers in over 190 countries, has recently tested the waters by airing exhibition events in golf and tennis.",

    "summary": "Americans looking to purchase EVs may want to do so quickly, as the incoming administration is likely to axe a $7,500 tax credit.",
    "story": [
      "With President-elect Donald Trump vowing to pull the plug on the $7,500 tax credit for buyers of electric vehicles, one EV maker and its billionaire owner are fully behind the idea and even stand to profit from it.",
      "\"Take away the subsidies, it will only help Tesla,\" Tesla owner Elon Musk posted in July on X, the social media platform he owns.",
      "The credit granted to buyers of EVs helped make the case for buying the climate-friendlier vehicles, and when an earlier version of the tax credit was done away with several years ago, Tesla cut prices on its cars by about half of the credit its buyers were no longer receiving.",
      "Tesla is the sole automaker to be generating a profit on its U.S. sales. Manufacturing EVs is a losing proposition for Big Three vehicle makers like Ford and General Motors, who sell a fraction of EVs compared with Tesla.",
      "Once the EV tax credit is vanquished, the price of EVs overall might drop, cutting into Tesla's profits, as opposed to increasing the company's red ink as it could for legacy automakers still working to get a firmer footing in the EV market. Should traditional automakers scale back on their EV production and sales to curtail the losses, EV shoppers would have even fewer options, benefiting Tesla.",
      "As Musk touted his support for axing the EV tax credit, Tesla's auto industry rivals signaled the opposite.",
      "The Alliance for Automotive Innovation urged that the tax credit continue, telling lawmakers in an October letter that U.S. manufacturers count on it as they vie with Chinese EV production. Around the world, vehicle makers have poured billions into transitioning to electric cars.",
      "Further, the Zero Emission Transportation Association on Friday called on Trump to reconsider, saying the tax credit has bolstered employment in states that voted Republican, including Ohio, Kentucky, Michigan and Georgia.",
      "\"If the United States is going to continue to fight to bring those jobs here and actually compete to win against China, there needs to be a demand signal \u2014 like the New Clean Vehicle Tax Credit \u2014 aligned with that goal, otherwise we would be undercutting those investments and hurting American job growth,\" ZETA Executive Director Albert Gore stated on Friday.",
      "\"The potential elimination of the federal tax credit for electric vehicles by the Trump administration \u2014 without another form of incentive to replace it \u2014 could derail the trajectory of EV sales in the United States,\" offered Edmunds analysts.",
      "Trump repeatedly vowed to eliminate what he labeled President Joe Biden's \"EV mandate\" as he campaigned for the White House.",
      "While there is no such mandate in federal law, the Inflation Reduction Act passed during President Biden's term revived the credit for many EV purchases, while also granting low interest loans to manufacturers constructing EV and battery plants.",
      "Trump's transition team intends to knock out the credit as part of a broader tax-reform measure, according to a Thursday report by Reuters, which cited two sources with direct knowledge of the matter.",
      "The president-elect during his first term attempted to repeal the EV tax credit, which was expanded by President Biden in 2022.",
      "Analysts who track Tesla concurred with Musk's view that the credit's demise would only help his company.",
      "\"This is a clear negative for the EV industry at first look and would particularly hurt GM, Ford, Stellantis and Rivian,\" wrote Wedbush Securities tech analyst Daniel Ives. Conversely, \"this will enable Tesla to further fend off competition from Detroit as pricing/scale/scope is an apples-to-oranges when compared to the rest of the auto industry once the EV tax credit disappears.\"",
      "Americans looking to buy an electric car should do so sooner rather than later, advised Ivan Drury, Edmunds' director Insights.",
      "\"The federal tax credit combined with slashed prices due to slowed sales momentum has contributed to electric vehicles becoming labeled as some of the best deals on the market in 2024. Now, with production cuts shrinking supply and a fresh wave of demand from those seeking a deal while they still can, it can be all but assured that the price for that EV you've been eyeing is going up in the coming months,\" Drury stated.",

      "What happens next to the Social Security Fairness Act?",
      "Despite having 62 cosponsors in the Senate, the bill still needs to be brought up for a vote by the chamber's leadership, and soon.",
      "The bill \"dies December 31, at the end of the second session of Congress,\" Benton said. \"Not only would this bill have to start from scratch, but a new person would have to introduce it.\"",
      "The Republican and Democratic lawmakers who introduced the measures in their respective bodies either did not run for reelection or lost their reelection bid, as was the case with Ohio Senator Sherrod Brown, a Democrat, who introduced the bill in the Senate.",
      "If the Social Security Fairness Act comes up for a vote in the Senate, it's expected to pass, having already secured 62 co-sponsors \u2014 surpassing the majority needed to send it to President Joe Biden for his signature.",
      "If signed into law, the changes would be effective for benefits payable after December 2023.",
      "What does the Social Security Fairness Act do?",
      "The legislation would cut two provisions that curtail retirement payments for public workers and their surviving spouses and family members, the Windfall Elimination Provision (WEP) and the Government Pension Offset (GPO), which Spanberger and Graves argue are tantamount to theft of those workers' benefits.",
      "\"For more than 40 years, the Social Security trust funds have been artificially propped up by stolen benefits that millions of Americans paid for and that their families deserve,\" they said in a Nov. 13 statement.",
      "As things stand now, the WEP reduces the Social Security benefits of workers who also receive a public pension from a job not covered by Social Security. For instance, that would include teachers who don't earn Social Security through their public school positions but who work part-time or during the summer in jobs that are covered by Social Security, even though they pay into the system over enough quarters to qualify.",
      "The GPO impacts the spousal benefits of people who work for federal, state or local governments \u2014 including police officers, firefighters and teachers \u2014 if the job is not covered by Social Security. The GPO cuts by two-thirds the benefit received by surviving spouses who also collect a government pension, often offsetting benefits entirely.",
      "For instance, under the GPO, someone who receives a $900 spousal benefit from Social Security but who also has a $1,000 non-covered pension would see their Social Security benefit cut by $667. That would leave them with a $233 remaining spousal benefit from Social Security.",
      "Under the Social Security Fairness Act, the same person would receive the entire $900 spousal benefit.",
      "\"Workers should be able to count on the retirement benefits they've earned,\" said Senator Elizabeth Warren, D-MA, an original cosponsor of the bill. \"It's time to pass the Social Security Fairness Act so government workers and their families and people with disabilities are not punished for earning multiple sources of retirement income.\"",
      "What is the chance of the Social Security Fairness Act passing?",
      "The biggest opposition to the bill is its cost. The Congressional Budget Office estimates it would cost upward of $190 billion over a decade.",
      "\"It would hasten the combined trust funds shortfall by six months to a year, when it's already in trouble,\" said Benton, who said TSCL supports reforming Social Security to resolve its projected insolvency in 2033 to 2034.",
      "\"The long-term solvency of Social Security is an issue that Congress must address \u2014 but an issue that is wholly separate from allowing Virginians, Louisianans, and Americans across our country who did their part and contributed their earnings to retire with dignity,\" Graves and Spanberger said in their joint statement.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Republican Rep. Nancy Mace of South Carolina introduced legislation Monday to change House rules to prohibit transgender women from using women's bathrooms and other facilities on Capitol Hill, a proposal that comes just before the House prepares to swear-in the first openly transgender member of Congress.",
      "Mace's two-page resolution would bar House members, officers and employees from using single-sex facilities in the Capitol or House office buildings that do not correspond with their \"biological sex.\" Her proposal claims that allowing \"biological males\" into women's restrooms, locker rooms and changing rooms \"jeopardizes the safety and dignity\" of female lawmakers, officers and Capitol Hill employees.",
      "The House sergeant-at-arms would be tasked with enforcing the measure, if approved.",
      "The South Carolina Republican's legislation appears to target Rep.-elect Sarah McBride of Delaware, who became the first openly transgender person elected to Congress when she won the race for the state's only House seat two weeks ago.",
      "McBride called Mace's resolution a \"blatant attempt from far right-wing extremists to distract from the fact that they have no real solutions to what Americans are facing. We should be focused on bringing down the cost of housing, health care, and child care, not manufacturing culture wars.\"",
      "\"Every day Americans go to work with people who have life journeys different than their own and engage with them respectfully, I hope members of Congress can muster that same kindness,\" she wrote on social media.",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson said in a statement Wednesday that single-sex facilities in the Capitol and House office buildings, like restrooms, locker rooms and changing rooms, \"are reserved for individuals of that biological sex.\" He noted that each member's office has a private restroom and said there are unisex restrooms throughout the Capitol.",
      "\"Women deserve women's only spaces,\" he said.",
      "McBride said she will follow the rules outlined by Johnson \"even if I disagree with them.\"",
      "\"This effort to distract from the real issues facing this country hasn't distracted me over the last several days, as I've remained hard at work preparing to represent the greatest state in the union come January,\" she said in a statement shared to social media.",
      "Johnson's statement came on Transgender Day of Remembrance, which is observed on Nov. 20 and honors transgender people who have died from violence. He acknowledged Tuesday that the issue of restroom access for transgender lawmakers is one the lower chamber has not confronted before, but told reporters that the House would address it \"in deliberate fashion with member consensus on it, and we will accommodate the needs of every single person.\"",
      "Johnson said he would not \"engage in silly debates\" when asked whether McBride is a man or a woman.",
      "\"We welcome all new members with open arms who are duly elected representatives of the people,\" Johnson said. \"I believe it's a command that we treat all persons with dignity and respect, and we will, and I'm not going to engage in silly debates about this.\"",
      "He declined to say whether he plans to include Mace's proposal in a package of rules that will govern the next Congress.",
      "\"We don't look down upon anyone. We treat everybody with dignity and respect. That's a principle that I've pursued my whole life,\" he said. \"And we will take care of this issue of first impression for Congress as we will any other thing. We'll provide appropriate accommodation for every member of Congress.\"",
      "Johnson later sought to clarify his response about whether McBride is a man or a woman.",
      "\"A man is a man and a woman is a woman and a man cannot become a woman,\" he said. \"That said, I also believe \u2014 that's what Scripture teaches, what I just said \u2014 but I also believe that we treat everybody with dignity and so we can do and believe all those things at the same time.\"",
      "House Democrats condemned Mace's resolution and accused her of bullying a fellow member of Congress.",
      "\"This is what we're doing? This is the lesson that you've drawn from the election in November? This is your priority, that you want to bully a member of Congress, as opposed to welcoming her to join this body so all of us can work together to get things done and deliver real results for the American people?\" Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries said.",

    "title": "How could the U.S. military be used for Trump's mass deportation plan?",
    "published": "Wed, 20 Nov 2024 20:31:57 -0500",
    "summary": "Trump signaled this week that he would enlist the help of the U.S. military for his massive deportation operation.",
    "story": [
      "President-elect Donald Trump has vowed to start the largest deportation effort in American history \u2014 his signature 2024 campaign promise \u2014 as soon as he takes office, signaling this week that he would enlist the help of the U.S. military for the massive operation to deport undocumented immigrants.",
      "Earlier this week, he shared a social media post indicating that he'd declare a national emergency and deploy military assets to carry out deportations.",
      "Still, how exactly the military would be tapped to carry out this promise of mass deportations is unclear. And there are untested legal questions about involving service members in immigration enforcement operations.",
      "The Department of Defense has provided operational support to immigration and border authorities for decades, under both Republican and Democratic presidents. Roughly 4,000 service members \u2013 primarily from the National Guard \u2014 are currently authorized to support the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) security mission along the southwest border, according to the U.S. Northern Command.",
      "While longstanding federal law generally prohibits the use of the military for domestic law enforcement \u2014 which includes immigration arrests and deportations \u2014 a few rarely invoked statutory exceptions exist.",
      "The Department of Defense's vast funding and resources could be instrumental in helping the incoming administration address the operational and financial challenges of carrying out deportations on a monumental scale. Immigration and Customs Enforcement's deportation branch has a fraction of the resources that would be necessary, with 6,000 agents and 41,000 detention beds. About 11 million immigrants are estimated to be living in the U.S. illegally.",
      "What have Trump and his allies said about using the military for deportations?",
      "In an interview with CBS' \"60 Minutes\" last month, Tom Homan, who Trump has appointed to be his \"border czar,\" indicated that one way to increase manpower for the mass deportation plan would be to re-hire retired ICE agents. Contractors, he added, could do some of the operational work, including handling transportation and setting up so-called \"soft-sided\" facilities, or tent detention sites, to hold migrant detainees.",
      "Homan said transportation and supply assets from the Department of Defense would also be helpful, suggesting that military planes could be used for deportation. But Stephen Miller, the incoming White House deputy chief of staff, has gone further than Homan, suggesting the National Guard could be deputized to arrest undocumented immigrants.",
      "\"We will deputize them as immigration enforcement officers,\" Miller said during a radio interview last year. \"They know their states, they know their communities, they know their cities.\"",
      "And while U.S. law generally bans the use of the armed forces for domestic law enforcement, during an interview with the New York Times last year, Miller said a revamped Trump administration would invoke what's known as the Insurrection Act to create an exception, enabling the use of federal troops to apprehend migrants.",
      "The military, Miller has also indicated, could be dispatched to the southern border with \"an impedance and denial mission.\"",
      "\"You reassert the fundamental constitutional principle that you don't have the right to enter into our sovereign territory, to even request an asylum claim,\" Miller said at this year's CPAC. \"The military has the right to establish a fortress position on the border to say no one can cross here at all.\"",
      "Finally, Trump has pledged to use the Alien and Sedition Acts of 1798 \u2014 a law invoked during World War II to approve the surveillance and detention of Italian, German, Japanese immigrants \u2014 to deport suspected migrant gang members.",
      "How could the military be deployed to the U.S. border?",
      "The U.S. military's role at the U.S.-Mexico border dates back to the Mexican American War, with additional buildup of troops at the southern border during the Mexican Revolution and World War I.",
      "\"For basically the past 40 years, the military's involvement at the border has been steadily growing,\" said Joseph Nunn, counsel at the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University's School of Law, \"And it has gone from sort of ad hoc to routine to deeply entrenched into how we approach border security and immigration.\"",
      "Members of the military stationed at the border have historically performed an array of support tasks, experts tell CBS News \u2013 from operating surveillance aircrafts and transporting U.S. Border Patrol personnel in helicopters to laying concertina wire and maintaining Customs and Border Protection vehicles.",
      "Homan's suggestions of using the military for some of the operational work that doesn't involve engaging with migrants would fall under this category and would be an expansion of the duties National Guard and a small number of active-duty troops have performed at the southern border under previous administrations. As recently as last year, troops were deployed to the border to help Border Patrol with administrative tasks, like warehouse management and clerical work.",
      "Military involvement now \"is just essentially to get access to more bodies and more aircrafts,\" Nunn explained, calling military mobilization a force multiplier. \"Suppose you want to set up a checkpoint on a highway in Texas or Arizona. Under normal circumstances, you need five CBP agents to run a checkpoint. If you have access to military personnel, you can run a checkpoint with one CBP agent assisted by four soldiers. Then suddenly five CBP agents assisted by soldiers can run five checkpoints instead of one.\"",
      "\"[The Trump administration] would also use the military to do things like build bases and facilities to hold people,\" senior fellow at the Atlantic Council, Thomas Warrick, told CBS News. \"He could use the military to fly detainees around the country or indeed to deport them to other countries if they can get landing rights.\"",
      "Can the U.S. military act as domestic law enforcement?",
      "Using the military in an active law enforcement role, rather than in a support capacity, would be more complex and unusual, but subject to at least one legal loophole.",
      "The Posse Comitatus Act bars federal armed forces from participating in law enforcement activities unless expressly authorized by Congress. But the 1807 Insurrection Act, which Miller mentioned, allows the president to utilize the military in domestic cases that warrant it. While the National Guard is under state control and not activated for federal service, it is not subject to Posse Comitatus.",
      "Abraham Lincoln used it during the Civil War, and in the 20th century, Dwight D. Eisenhower and John F. Kennedy relied on the law to desegregate schools, deploying troops to the South after the Supreme Court's landmark decision in Brown v. Board of Education. The most recent time it was used was in 1992 by President George H.W. Bush after both city and state leaders asked for federal help to quell the L.A. riots.",
      "According to the law, the military may be activated to enforce the laws on U.S. soil or to \"suppress rebellion\" whenever \"unlawful obstructions, combinations, or assemblages, or rebellion\" make it \"impracticable\" to enforce federal law in that state by the \"ordinary course of judicial proceedings.\"",
      "Can this be challenged in court?",
      "Lee Gelernt, a lawyer at the American Civil Liberties Union, said using the military to carry out deportations under the Alien and Sedition Acts would be \"patently unlawful,\" because current circumstances don't allow for it.",
      "\"The law requires an invasion by a foreign government,\" said Gelernt, who challenged many of the first Trump administration's immigration policies. \"That's not what is happening with immigration.\"",
      "There is already an agency, ICE, that enforces immigration laws with arrest authority that the U.S. military does not have.",
      "\"It was designed for unexpected emergencies,\" Nunn said, but added that, \"its text grants vast discretion to the president\" with \"no meaningful criteria\" to justify invoking it.",
      "In 1827, the Supreme Court ruled in Martin v. Mott that the president has the sole authority to decide whether a situation warrants deploying the military. However, \"If you can prove that the president has invoked the insurrection act in bad faith, which is going to be a high bar to clear but not impossible, you could potentially challenge the decision to invoke the Insurrection Act,\" Nunn explained, adding that the centuries-old law does not permit the military to violate constitutional rights or to violate otherwise applicable federal law.",
      "Peter Feaver, a professor of political science and public policy at Duke University who focuses on civil military relations, said using the military as law enforcement would be controversial and could degrade trust in the military, even if there is a legal case for it.",
      "\"This is not what the military trains for, but on top of all of that, it would be deeply politically polarizing because there'd be many many Americans who would view this as an inappropriate mission, a betrayal of our American values or something,,\" said Feaver, who has written a book called \"Thanks for Your Service: The Causes and Consequences of Public Confidence in the US Military.\"",
      "Congress has no role in invoking the Insurrection Act. In July, Connecticut Senator Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat, renewed his legislative push to overhaul the law. He first introduced a bill reforming the Insurrection Act in 2020, after Trump's threats to use troops to respond to civil rights protests across the U.S. following the police killing of George Floyd, but his efforts were stalled by Republican opposition and pushback from the Trump administration.",
      "What if Trump declared a national emergency at the border?",
      "Trump declared a national emergency at the border during his first administration, after Congress declined to fund border wall construction. He used the declaration to unilaterally divert Pentagon funds to expand the border wall.",
      "\"The Pentagon budget \u2013 that's where the money is,\" Warrick said. \"It's where the people are. It's where the aircrafts are.\"",
      "The long-term cost of deporting 1 million people per year could average $88 billion annually, according to the American Immigration Council, surpassing the Department of Homeland Security's $62 billion budget in fiscal year 2025 and totalling nearly $968 billion over a decade. The operation would also demand lightning-speed expansion of the immigration court systems and detention facilities.",
      "\"It's going to be astronomically expensive,\" Nunn said. \"And not only is it going to be straightforwardly expensive, but it's also going to come with opportunity costs \u2014 every military service member and military asset that is diverted to assist with a mass deportation program or to assist with border security is a service member or asset that is not carrying out their normal duties.\"",

      "The U.S.-provided APLs are different than the thousands of landmines being employed by Russia in eastern Ukraine in that they are \"non-persistent,\" meaning they become inert over a preset period of time, usually between four hours and two weeks, the official said. They are electrically fused and require battery power to detonate. Once the battery runs out, they will not detonate.",
      "Tuesday marked 1,000 days since Russia's invasion of Ukraine. CBS News learned Sunday that President Biden had lifted restrictions on Ukraine's use of U.S. weapons to conduct strikes deep inside Russia.",

      "Ukraine has been one of the most mined countries in the world since Russia's invasion in 2022, and Ukraine is inundated with APLs. They are known by deceptively innocent names such as \"butterfly\" or \"petal\" mines because they scatter like flower petals when they drop from the sky.",
      "\"Typically, several hundred of these at a time will just be liberally and indiscriminately spread across the territory,\" Pete Smith, the Ukraine program manager for the HALO Trust, a nonprofit organization focused on ridding warzones of landmines, told \"60 Minutes\" in August. \"They can rest on the roofs. They can sit in guttering. They can take years before they come back into society and into view.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Former Republican Rep. Matt Gaetz met with senators on Capitol Hill on Wednesday as he seeks to shore up support for his nomination for attorney general amid calls for the House Ethics Committee to release a report on allegations he engaged in sexual misconduct and illicit drug use.",
      "Accompanied by Vice President-elect JD Vance, a senator from Ohio, Gaetz sat down with Republican senators, whose votes will be crucial in confirming him to the position of the nation's top law enforcement officer next year. The GOP is set to take control of the Senate in the next Congress and hold 53 seats, but Gaetz will need backing from a majority of the chamber to win confirmation.",
      "President-elect Donald Trump announced Gaetz as his pick for attorney general last week, after which the Florida Republican resigned his seat from Congress. But the selection and Gaetz's resignation came two days before the House Ethics Committee was poised to meet and vote on whether to make public its report detailing the findings of its long-running investigation into allegations Gaetz engaged in sexual misconduct and illicit drug use.",
      "The Republican has denied wrongdoing and called the Ethics probe a \"smear.\" He has blamed the investigation on former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, whom\u00a0Gaetz helped oust last year. Alex Pfeiffer, a spokesman for Trump's transition, said in a statement Monday that \"Matt Gaetz will be the next Attorney General. He's the right man for the job and will end the weaponization of our justice system. These are baseless allegations intended to derail the second Trump administration.\"",
      "Trump told reporters Tuesday that he is not reconsidering his selection for attorney general.",
      "Incoming Senate Majority Leader John Thune met with Gaetz on Wednesday, a spokesperson for Thune confirmed to CBS News.",
      "The spokesperson said the two met \"to discuss the Senate confirmation process, and he reiterated that Mr. Gaetz deserves a fair and transparent process, something that all of President Trump's nominees deserve.\"",
      "The news of the meeting was first reported by Punchbowl.",
      "Gaetz and Vance also met with Sens. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, Mike Lee of Utah, Josh Hawley of Missouri, Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee, John Kennedy of Louisiana, and John Cornyn and Ted Cruz of Texas. The seven sit on the Judiciary Committee, which will conduct Gaetz's confirmation hearings early next year. Sen. Joni Ernst of Iowa also met with Gaetz and Vance on Wednesday.",
      "Hawley told CBS News that the purpose of the meeting was to discuss the need to get a confirmation hearing and ensure that Gaetz gets an opportunity \"to respond in public, under oath.\" Hawley outlined that he thinks Gaetz has talked to every member of the Judiciary Committee and many other senators who do not sit on the committee. He said he expects Gaetz to meet with all 53 incoming Republicans over the coming weeks.",
      "\"President Trump is very committed to moving this forward. And I know there's been some speculation among my colleagues that maybe this wouldn't actually go to a confirmation hearing, but they want one, and I think they're absolutely entitled to have that,\" he said. \"Gaetz wants the opportunity to testify, to respond to critics, answer questions, talk about his vision for the department.\"",
      "Hawley is likely to vote for all of Trump's nominees, he said, and believes there will be \"no shortage of information\" about Gaetz available for senators.",
      "At least one Republican senator, Susan Collins of Maine, said she has not been asked to meet with Gaetz yet. Collins is among the most moderate members of the conference, and her vote could be critical to Gaetz's confirmation. She previously said she was \"shocked\" by his selection.",
      "After his meeting with Gaetz, Graham said that while he tends to defer to presidential Cabinet choices \"unless the evidence suggests disqualification,\" the process for Trump's selections \"will not be a rubber stamp, nor will it be driven by a lynch mob.\"",
      "\"I fear the process surrounding the Gaetz nomination is turning into an angry mob, and unverified allegations are being treated as if they are true. I have seen this movie before,\" he said, an apparent reference to Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation process in 2018. \"I would urge all of my Senate colleagues, particularly Republicans, not to join the lynch mob and give the process a chance to move forward.\"",
      "Lee, speaking with reporters following his meeting with Gaetz, said Kavanaugh's Senate confirmation hearings should be a \"warning\" amid the allegations against the Florida Republican.",
      "\"There were a lot of allegations thrown at Brett Kavanaugh that turned out to be uncorroborated in many, many instances,\" Lee said. \"And so I do think that is something of a voice of warning people ought to take. Just because allegations are made, and just because people talk a lot about them \u2014 and sometimes in a fit of politically driven eagerness to embrace them, assume their\u00a0 truth \u2014 doesn't mean that they are, in fact, true.\"",
      "Kavanaugh was accused of engaging in sexual misconduct decades earlier and vehemently denied the accusations. The Judiciary Committee held a set of extraordinary hearings that included testimony from Kavanaugh and Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, who claimed he assaulted her during a party when they were in high school in the 1980s. Classmates who were at the party, however, could not corroborate Ford's allegations. Kavanaugh was confirmed by the Senate in a 50-48 vote, the narrowest margin in more than a century.",
      "Gaetz has been under investigation for several years by the House Ethics Committee and Justice Department, which looked into allegations of sex trafficking and obstruction. Prosecutors declined to charge Gaetz last year.",
      "Ten of the 11 Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee asked FBI Director Chris Wray to turn over the full evidentiary file in the now-closed federal sex trafficking probe involving Gaetz.",
      "\"The Senate has a constitutional duty to provide advice and consent on presidential nominees, and it is crucial that we review all the information necessary to fulfill this duty as we consider Mr. Gaetz's nomination,\" the Democratic senators wrote in a letter to Wray. \"The grave public allegations against Mr. Gaetz speak directly to his fitness to serve as the chief law enforcement officer for the federal government.\"",
      "The Ethics Committee said in June that it had spoken with more than a dozen witnesses, issued 25 subpoenas and reviewed thousands of pages of documents as part of its investigation. It said in a rare statement that \"certain allegations\" merited continued review, among those the claims of sexual misconduct and drug use, accepting improper gifts, giving \"special privileges and favors\" and obstructing government investigations into his conduct.",
      "Multiple sources told CBS News at the time that four women testified to the Ethics panel that they had been paid to go to parties, which Gaetz attended, that included sex and drugs. A lawyer for two women who spoke with the panel told CBS News on Monday that they testified that Gaetz paid them directly and repeatedly for sex, and said Venmo transactions for the encounters were obtained by the panel.",
      "The attorney, Joel Leppard, also said the women told House investigators that Gaetz asked about \"party favors\" and \"vitamins\" at upcoming parties via text messages, which was understood to be code for drugs. One of Leppard's clients testified before the Ethics Committee that she witnessed Gaetz having sex with a 17-year-old against a game table during a July 2017 party, months after he was sworn in as a House member.",

    "summary": "Rep. Susan Wild said there was \"no consensus\" on the issue and the committee agreed to reconvene on Dec. 5.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The House Ethics Committee, meeting to consider the release of a report on its investigation into former Rep. Matt Gaetz, did not reach an agreement on Wednesday afternoon, the committee chairman said.",
      "The meeting came one week after the Florida Republican resigned from Congress following President-elect Donald Trump's decision to select him for attorney general.",
      "House Ethics Committee chairman Michael Guest told reporters that the panel had not reached an \"agreement to release the report\" as he exited the meeting Wednesday afternoon.",
      "Guest told CBS News that he voted against the release of the report, saying \"the committee no longer has jurisdiction on the issue so I disagreed with the release of the information.\"",
      "The committee's other members did not comment on the more than two-hour meeting as they exited.",
      "Rep. Susan Wild, the ranking Democrat on the committee, addressed reporters after Guest's comments, saying the committee members had agreed not to discuss what transpired at the meeting. She said Guest had \"betrayed the process\" by disclosing the deliberations, expressing frustration at the implication that there was unanimity among the panel.",
      "Wild said the idea that the committee had reached an agreement not to move forward was \"untrue.\" She noted that in order to move something forward in the evenly divided committee, a member has to cross party lines and vote with the other side.",
      "\"There was no consensus on this issue,\" she continued. \"We did agree that we would reconvene as a committee on Dec. 5 to further consider this matter.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Gaetz and Vice President-elect JD Vance met Wednesday with a number of Senate Republicans in the Capitol as they look to shore up support for his nomination. When asked by reporters Wednesday evening  for his reaction to the developments from the Ethics Committee, Gaetz said he wasn't paying much attention to the panel.",
      "\"I'll be honest with you, I've been focused on what we got to do to reform the Department of Justice,\" Gaetz said. \"I have been meeting with senators. I haven't been paying much attention to that.\"",
      "Gaetz said he was looking forward to his confirmation hearing in the Senate.",
      "Incoming Senate Majority Leader John Thune also met with Gaetz Wednesday, a spokesperson for Thune confirmed to CBS News.",
      "The spokesperson said that the two met \"to discuss the Senate confirmation process, and he reiterated that Mr. Gaetz deserves a fair and transparent process, something that all of President Trump's nominees deserve.\"",
      "The news of the meeting was first reported by Punchbowl.",
      "The House Ethics Committee, which is made up of five Republicans and five Democrats, had been investigating allegations that Gaetz engaged in sexual misconduct and illicit drug use. The investigation first began in 2021, but was put on pause as the Justice Department conducted a sex trafficking and obstruction probe of Gaetz. Last year, the Ethics Committee resumed its work, after the DOJ declined to charge Gaetz, who has denied all wrongdoing.",
      "The panel has faced growing pressure to release the potentially damaging report following Trump's announcement, as the Senate gears up for a fight over the president-elect's most controversial Cabinet picks seeking confirmation. Before the move, the committee had planned to meet Friday for a vote on whether to release the report, sources told CBS News. But Gaetz's resignation from the House ended the committee's jurisdiction, complicating the path forward since normally reports on former members are not released.",
      "Speaker Mike Johnson himself urged the committee not to release the report, warning last week of the \"terrible precedent\" the move would set, opening \"Pandora's box.\" But the committee's top Democrat has advocated for the report to be released, while senators on both sides of the aisle have pushed for it to be made available to the Senate Judiciary Committee as the chamber looks to exercise its advice and consent role over Trump's Cabinet selections. On Wednesday morning, Senate Democrats on the Judiciary Committee also sent a letter to the FBI requesting Gaetz's complete evidentiary file related to the investigation into alleged sex trafficking of minors.",
      "In June, the Ethics Committee said as part of its investigation, it had spoken with more than a dozen witnesses, issued 25 subpoenas and reviewed thousands of pages of documents. It noted that \"certain allegations\" merited continued review, including claims of sexual misconduct, drug use and obstructing government investigations into his conduct, among others.",
      "A lawyer for two women who spoke with the committee told CBS News that the women testified to the committee that Gaetz paid them directly and repeatedly for sex, and noted that Venmo transactions related to the encounters had been obtained by the panel. One of the attorney's clients testified that she witnessed Gaetz having sex with a 17-year-old during a July 2017 party.",
      "The Ethics Committee's move on Wednesday comes as Senate Republicans, who flipped the upper chamber in the 2024 elections, are set to hold a narrow majority in the new Congress, bolstering Trump's agenda and likely helping to streamline confirmation of his administration and judicial nominees. But their majority is a narrow one, putting the fate of Trump's more controversial picks \u2014 such as Gaetz \u2014 up in the air.",
      "Trump said on Tuesday that he is not reconsidering his selection of Gaetz for attorney general.",

    "published": "Wed, 20 Nov 2024 18:46:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Martin O'Malley and Ken Martin have both jumped in the race for DNC chair, while others are exploring runs.",
    "story": [
      "Two candidates have officially launched their campaign to be the next chair of the Democratic National Committee, kicking off the race to determine who will lead the party's recovery after widespread losses in 2024.",
      "Martin O'Malley, a 2016 Democratic presidential candidate and former Maryland Governor, became the first notable figure to jump into the race on Monday. Ken Martin, who is the chair of Minnesota's arm of the Democratic party, and a DNC vice chair, announced his campaign Tuesday morning.",
      "Democrats are sifting through the fallout of the 2024 presidential election, where they not only lost the White House and control of the Senate but also failed to win back control of the House. The party finds itself without a clear leader and unified vision for the future, representing both a hurdle for the next DNC chair but also an opportunity to overhaul Democrats' approach with voters across the country in the coming years.",
      "Whoever the party's over 440 members elect to lead the party's national committee will be in charge of the party's top-level infrastructure, organizing and fundraising. And while DNC members tell CBS News that the eventual chair won't determine the widespread policy of the party, that person will serve as a notable mouthpiece to help craft the Democratic message.",
      "While the party itself was locked out of federal control after the elections, fundraising remained strong. As a candidate, Vice President Kamala Harris raked in over $1 billion within the few months she was in the race. Her sum includes money raised by the DNC.",
      "Jamie Harrison, the current DNC chair, has said he would not seek reelection.",
      "The timeline for the election is not yet determined, though it will be addressed in a DNC Rules & Bylaws committee meeting on Dec. 12. DNC members expect the election itself to take place at their widespread member meeting before early spring 2025.",
      "In their launches, O'Malley and Martin both said prioritizing the party's message on the economy is essential. The state of the economy was a big issue that bolstered President-elect Donald Trump's return to office, according to a CBS News exit poll.",
      "\"When I'm traveling around the country, most people I chat with want the same things: to stay ahead on their bills, to give their families a better life and to live in safe and healthy communities. That's exactly what Democrats stand for, but we need to reconnect our ideas,\" Martin said in his campaign video.",
      "Chuck Rocha, a political strategist who worked for Sen. Bernie Sanders' presidential campaign and Sen-elect Ruben Gallego's campaign, told CBS News he is \"seriously considering\" a run for chair and has fielded calls from a handful of DNC members and nonprofits.",
      "Rocha said he's still waiting to see how the field develops before jumping in, and \"if there's a better candidate that really stands for what I want to see done with the party.\"",
      "But Rocha has set several action items he would take as chair: eliminate education requirements for senior DNC positions, mandating that state parties \"be more inclusive\" and diverse with consultant hiring, and to focus on building party infrastructure in all 50 states.",
      "Asked about Martin's and O'Malley's campaigns, Rocha called them \"names that are from the institution.\"",
      "\"I think we need somebody from the outside and a strategist to come in and rebuild the party,\" said Rocha, who noted that his non-college background and upbringing in East Texas could be an advantage as the party looks to reconnect with working-class voters.",
      "Other names that could potentially run include Wisconsin Democratic Party Chair Ben Wikler, who is \"seriously considering\" a run for chair according to a source familiar with his thinking.",
      "Rahm Emanuel, the current U.S. ambassador to Japan and former Chicago Mayor, is also mulling over a run according to Axios. But potentially choosing Emanuel, a polarizing figure in the Democratic party, has been panned by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and progressive groups.",
      "Martin, a DNC member since he became a state party chair in 2011, may be the early favorite. Alan Clendenin, an executive DNC board member who is already supporting Martin, said he has \"a lot of friends in the DNC\" and pointed to relationships built from his time as President of the Association of State Democratic Committees (ASDC). Clendenin said Martin already has support from just under 100 DNC committee members.",
      "\"The party is in a place where we have to have someone who has a really solid understanding of existing party infrastructure. What's there, what's not there. People who have walked the walk. Talked the talk. People who have had to deal with the frustration of what's lacking and be able to understand what it takes to turn things around,\" Clendenin said about Martin and the chair position.",
      "Democrats' lack of success in 2024 could linger over any of the candidates in the race. While Minnesota has been a reliably blue state under Martin's watch, it's not seen as a presidential battleground state. But if Democrats wanted to gravitate towards someone from any of the seven presidential battlegrounds, the fact that the Harris-Walz ticket lost every one of them may prove to be a hindrance for a party incredibly eager to avoid a repeat performance in 2028.",
      "\"We just need to win,\" said one DNC member about the stakes of the chair race. \"We need to know who's coming with the game plan to make it happen\u2026 We don't make policy. We win elections, and we win presidential elections. That's our priority.\"",

    "published": "Wed, 20 Nov 2024 17:46:43 -0500",
    "summary": "Conspiracies persist, although it is effectively impossible to steal a major election in the United States.",
    "story": [
      "We just had another election with a clear and verifiable victor, overseen by hundreds of thousands of election officials. Those public servants have suffered years of harassment, and despite their successes, are still being accused of taking part in a massive and impossible conspiracy \u2014 a conspiracy led by the party out of power to steal an election and cover up all evidence.",
      "Despite all evidence, many still believe that the opposition Democrats secretly overwhelmed the power of the Trump administration in 2020 to steal an election by 7 million popular votes and 70 electoral votes. And they believe that the Biden administration suddenly lost this mythical election-stealing power while controlling the executive branch in 2024.",
      "Within hours of President-elect Donald\u00a0Trump's projected victory in the 2024 election, conspiracy theories began to spread among those who opposed him. On the left, there were claims that \"the math just didn't add up,\" that 20 million ballots were \"missing\" or that Elon Musk's Starlink was uploading fake votes to help Trump. There was mischaracterization about why voters might split their votes between Trump and a Democrat.",
      "On the right, from those who supported Trump came claims that the \"20 million missing ballots\" were actually proof that the 2020 election had been stolen and that there was no possible way that President Biden could have received 81 million votes that year.",
      "For those who work in elections, and particularly the election officials around the country \u2014 public servants of both parties \u2014 these claims are familiar, and exhausting. And to be clear, these claims are false on their face.",
      "Millions of ballots weren't missing \u2013 they were being counted, and when the election is officially certified, we will confirm that the 2024 election saw only slightly lower turnout than 2020's all-time record. For those questioning \"missing votes,\" the 2024 election will end up seeing the second-largest number of ballots cast in any American election, and the second-highest turnout in any election in over 100 years, behind only 2020's record turnout.",
      "As for split votes, that happens all the time. Sometimes, as in 2020, there are a large number of voters who dislike both presidential candidates and choose to leave that race blank on their ballots. Sometimes, as in 2024, a significant number of people vote only for president, and leave the rest of their ballots blank. This is normal. Republicans in Arizona, Nevada, and Wisconsin didn't game the system to give Trump a win this year while allowing Democratic senators to win in each of those states. Democrats in 2020 didn't rig the system to defeat Trump that year, only to then give up key seats in state legislatures right before redistricting that would decide control of Congress. And we have the paper ballots that confirm this.",
      "And those paper ballots are the key. Trump won in 2024 in a verified, confirmed election with over 95% paper ballots, including all the ballots in all the swing states. Hand audits of those ballots are nearly complete and will confirm the results.",
      "Similarly, Mr. Biden won in 2020 in a verified, confirmed election with over 95% audited paper ballots, including all the ballots in all the swing states. The math adds up because the ballots add up, and the election officials have shown their work.",
      "We know who won the last two presidential elections, thanks to the paper ballots, audits, and more election litigation and court review than any election in world history. In dozens of court cases, losing candidates couldn't produce a single piece of evidence that raised any question about the 2020 election outcome.",
      "When Rudy Giuliani and Kari Lake were sued for defamation about their false claims, they could have defended themselves with evidence that they were speaking the truth. Instead, they conceded liability (Giuliani's assets have begun to be seized, and Lake just settled her case this past weekend). Fox News settled its defamation case with Dominion Voting Systems for nearly $800 million, rather than attempt to present evidence of the truth of its claims. A group of esteemed conservative legal scholars further confirmed the 2020 election was \"Lost, not Stolen.\"",
      "But whether coming from the right or the left, the conspiracies continue, and our nation's election officials are concerned about the lasting damage. Gabriel Sterling, chief operating officer of the Georgia Secretary of State's office told me, \"Ideas that Musk's Starlink or black box voting might change votes plant seeds that will germinate into deeper conspiracy theories, and then further undermine faith in elections and institutions.\"",
      "Maricopa County Supervisor Bill Gates confirmed, \"People who push conspiracy theories without basis that tabulation machines have been breached or that dead people have voted by the thousands do harm to our democracy, regardless of whether the allegations come from the right, left or the middle of the political spectrum.\"",
      "Our elections are incredibly decentralized, with nearly 10,000 different election jurisdictions nationwide, varying in technologies and processes. Our process is run by hundreds of thousands of election officials nationwide, of both parties. Every voter registration requires ID under federal law, and our voter records are as accurate as ever. In the exceedingly rare cases where fraud is attempted, it is caught and prosecuted. It is effectively impossible to steal a major election in the United States.",
      "But foreign adversaries and domestic grifters understand how to exploit concerns about the security of American elections. They have employed a more effective strategy, to convince us against all evidence that our elections are being stolen. They have become masters at leveraging the losing side's disappointment at the outcome to create a fantasy world of election denial and to stoke fear, anger and hate directed at our fellow citizens, including our public servants. We saw on Jan. 6, 2021,\u00a0how this anger can lead to violence.",
      "Entertaining these delusions could threaten our agency as voters. Worse, our susceptibility to these false claims aids U.S. adversaries, and puts public servants at risk. If we become a nation where both parties can only accept the integrity of our election system when they win, we are truly lost as a democracy.",

Behavior that might have gotten a person fired or canceled (or not nominated to a cabinet position) over the last several years, appears to be less problematic in the Trump 2.0 era.",
      "To be clear: three of the men \u2014 Gaetz, Hegseth and Musk \u2014 have consistently denied the allegations against them.",
      "Gaetz, Trump's attorney general pick, said he did not have a sexual relationship with a minor, a 17-year-old, while he was a member of Congress, despite sworn witness testimony to the contrary. Gaetz allies also point to a Justice Department investigation that yielded no charges.",

The eight plaintiffs said that during the course of their employment with SpaceX, they were exposed to \"unwanted conduct and comments of a sexual nature by Elon Musk that created a hostile and abusive work environment,\" their lawsuit said. Musk denied the allegations, according to\u00a0The Associated Press. Musk has been tapped to co-lead the Department of Government Efficiency, a government agency Trump intends to establish.",
      "Kennedy, Trump's pick to lead the Department of Health and Human Services, is the only one of the four who indicated it was possible that he had acted inappropriately, apologizing to a former nanny for allegations of unwanted sexual advances in the 1990s.",
      "He told CBS News that he does not recall the conduct in question, but does not want to \"leave anybody in the world feeling like I did something that was insensitive or inappropriate.\"",
      "Asked whether he might have to make a similar apology to someone else in the future, Kennedy replied, \"It's quite possible. I'm 70 years old. I had a very rambunctious life.\"",
      "Trump himself has been accused of sexual misconduct by at least 15 women. In 2023, a jury found him civilly liable for sexually abusing writer E. Jean Carroll.",
      "The Trump transition team has not responded to a request for comment.",
      "Machismo was often a centerpiece of Trump's appeal to voters during the 2024 campaign. He regularly spoke about toughness \u2014 whether that trait applied to his immigration policy, combating illicit drug trade or surviving two assassination attempts.",
      "Wrestler Hulk Hogan delivered a primetime speech at the Republican National Convention, ripping off his shirt while lavishing praise on the nominee.",
      "And Trump also spent time on right-leaning podcasts with largely male audiences.",
      "His entreaties to male culture paid off in November. He had a bigger advantage among male voters against Kamala Harris, winning this group by 13 percentage points, compared to the 8-point advantage he had against President Biden in 2020, and the 11-point margin over Hillary Clinton in 2016.",
      "The Senate will have final say on whether Gaetz, Hegseth and Kennedy become confirmed cabinet secretaries. Ahead of their confirmation hearings, Republican senators, who are likely to have to provide nearly all of the votes for these four nominees, did not say much about their prospects.",

      "\"Stimulus checks typically only happen when the economy is in really bad shape and consumers need a push to start spending money again,\" LendingTree senior economist Jacob Channel told CBS MoneyWatch. \"That's not really the case in the present.\"",
      "Is the economy bad enough for a new stimulus check?",
      "While a majority of Americans give the economy poor ratings, economists say that it's in good shape overall, with solid GDP growth, inflation that is inching closer to the Federal Reserve's 2% annual goal and a jobless rate of 4.1% \u2014 which is near a 50-year low.",
      "\"Despite some pain points and general 'bad vibes' expressed by some people, the economy is currently in remarkably good shape and consumer spending is relatively strong,\" Channel said.",
      "Even so, many inflation-weary consumers say they haven't yet seen the benefit of that growth. The November 5 presidential election was viewed as a mandate from voters for a new economic direction.",
      "Could Trump issue a stimulus check?",
      "While some consumers might believe that Trump or Biden alone was responsible for sending out stimulus checks \u2014 perhaps because Trump put his name on the memo line of the first check \u2014 the payments were part of three bills passed by Congress, which were then sent to the sitting president for his signature.",
      "\"A president can't unilaterally issue stimulus checks, and the ones sent out during his last administration were largely the result of a push from Democrats in the House and Senate,\" Channel noted. \"Though Trump ultimately did sign the bill that sent stimulus checks to Americans, he isn't solely responsible for them.\"",
      "In other words, there would first need to be legislation passed by Congress to authorize another stimulus check, something that currently isn't on the horizon.",
      "Would a stimulus check impact inflation?",
      "With the Federal Reserve still aiming to pare inflation to a 2% annual rate \u2014 it stood at 2.6% last month \u2014 policymakers are likely to be cautious about any actions that could reignite inflation. Some economists have pointed to the surge in federal spending during the pandemic as\u00a0helping to create the conditions that led to the hottest inflation in 40 years.",
      "\"Because inflation is still such a big concern at the moment, the last thing a reasonable government would want to do is further stimulate consumer demand with stimulus checks because doing so would unnecessarily risk causing a resurgence in inflation,\" Channel noted.",
      "That being said, Trump's economic policies, including adding tariffs to imports and deporting millions of undocumented immigrants, could cause an inflation bump of as much of 1 percentage point, economists have said. That would push inflation to a range of about 3.6%, which Wall Street cautions could cause the Fed to hold off on further rate cuts.",
      "Could the IRS issue stimulus checks in 2024?",
      "The IRS sent the three rounds of pandemic stimulus checks after they were authorized by Congress and signed into law by Trump and Biden. In other words, without Congress' approval, the IRS won't be sending any stimulus checks in 2024.",
      "Currently there is no legislation in the works for stimulus spending, and such legislation is also considered extremely unlikely to occur in 2025. Instead, Trump and Republican lawmakers are likely to focus on tax legislation to extend the tax cuts in his 2017 Tax Cuts & Jobs Act, as well as tackling other spending issues, experts say.",

    "summary": "Director of Pentagon office probing UFOs showed Congress 3 cases it's resolved, but also discussed 3 \u2014 out of nearly two dozen \u2014 still under active investigation.",
    "story": [
      "The Pentagon office investigating UFOs, or what the government calls unidentified anomalous phenomena, resolved one of its most prominent cases \u2014 nicknamed \"GOFAST\" \u2014 its director told Congress in a hearing on Tuesday. (It's the last one listed on the office's website here).",
      "The GOFAST video was made public in 2017 and shows what appears to be an object flying at a high speed just above water, but Dr. Jon Kosloski, the director of the All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Office, told Congress the object depicted is not actually too unusual.",
      "\"Through a very careful geospatial intelligence analysis and using trigonometry, we assess with high confidence that the object is not actually close to the water, but is rather closer to 13,000 feet,\" Kosloski said.",
      "Kosloski did not identify the object, but he said that a \"trick of the eye\" called parallax made the object appear anomalous \u2014 or out of the ordinary \u2014 when it was not. He said a detailed report on parallax will be available on the All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Office website.",
      "The \"GOFAST\" video was recorded by a fighter jet from the USS Theodore Roosevelt off the East coast of the U.S. and made public in 2017.",
      "Former F/A-18 pilot Ryan Graves, who has spoken with CBS' \"60 Minutes\" about UAP sightings and later founded Americans for Safe Aerospace, told NBC News Now in an interview after the hearing that the Pentagon should continue to investigate the GOFAST case.",
      "\"I would argue that some of these cases aren't quote unquote debunked or no longer of interest, specifically the GOFAST video itself was never really interesting because it was going fast,\" Graves said. \"The pilots certainly didn't say that, nor did they name the video. If anything, the Pentagon simply debunked their own naming for that video.\"",
      "Graves also said there were more objects in the air at the time than the one depicted in the GOFAST video. The Pentagon is still investigating another video nicknamed GIMBAL that was taken around the time of the GOFAST video.",
      "After providing examples to Congress of two other resolved cases the Defense Department calls \"The Puerto Rico Objects\" and \"Mt. Etna,\" Kosloski described cases his office is still actively investigating, notably, an \"orange orb\" and \"a metallic cylinder.\"",
      "These cases are likely part of the 21 cases that the recently released annual unidentified aerial phenomena report said contain enough information and data for the office to actively investigate.",
      "One case was reported by a law enforcement officer \"out West\" who observed \"a large orange orb floating several hundred feet above the ground,\" according to Kosloski.",
      "As the officer approached where he thought the orb would be, he saw \"a blacker than black object\" that was about the size of a Prius. When he reached a distance of 40-60 meters away from the object, it tilted 45 degrees and shot up vertically, traveling faster than any drone he had seen before.",
      "Just as it left his field of view, it emitted bright red and blue lights that lit up the inside of his vehicle \"as brightly as if someone had set off fireworks just outside of his vehicle,\" Kosloski told Congress.",
      "Another case was reported from the southeastern part of the United States after two cars driven by government contractors left a facility around 9 a.m. and saw \"a large metallic cylinder about the size of a commercial airplane.\"",
      "After they observed it for 15-20 seconds, it disappeared.",
      "\"Obviously an object that large and stationary \u2014 unless it's a blimp \u2014 is unusual but then disappearing, we can't explain how that would happen,\" Kosloski said.",

Since then, Trump won the presidential election and will be headed to the White House in January.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014\u00a0An \"unknown and unauthorized third party\" has gained access to two dozen depositions of witnesses tied to the various investigations into former Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida, CBS News has learned.",
      "The leaked materials are part of a civil defamation case filed by Chris Dorworth, a lobbyist who is close to Gaetz. These materials include the sworn deposition of the minor with whom Gaetz allegedly had sex.",
      "According to a source familiar with the matter and an email viewed by CBS News, the person who gained access went by the name \"Altam Beezley.\"",
      "Gaetz has denied any wrongdoing.\u00a0The New York Times first reported on the alleged leak.",
      "Gaetz was under investigation by the House Ethics Committee and Justice Department, though federal prosecutors declined to bring charges against him last year. The Ethics panel was looking into allegations the former congressman engaged in sexual misconduct and illicit drug use, among other accusations. But Gaetz resigned his seat in the House last week after President-elect Donald Trump announced he had selected the Florida Republican to serve as his attorney general.",
      "Because Gaetz is no longer a House member, the Ethics Committee's jurisdiction over him has ended.",
      "Trump's announcement of Gaetz as his pick for attorney general came days before the ethics panel was set to convene to vote on whether to release a potentially damaging report detailing the findings of its investigation into the former congressman.",
      "The committee postponed the meeting, which was set for Friday, though two sources told CBS News that it is now set to gather Wednesday. House Speaker Mike Johnson has cautioned against releasing the report on Gaetz, telling CNN on Sunday that the Ethics Committee's jurisdiction does not extend to non-members of Congress.",
      "But some lawmakers, including in the Senate, have said the public should have access to it. Rep. Susan Wild of Pennsylvania, the top Democrat on the Ethics Committee, told reporters Monday that the panel's report should be made public and released to the Senate, which would vote after Trump takes office on whether to confirm Gaetz as attorney general.",
      "Wild said she believes the committee should vote on whether to disclose the report and estimates there is unanimous support from Democrats on the Ethics Committee to do so. But making the report public would require support from a majority of the panel, so at least one Republican would have to join their Democratic colleagues in voting to give the American people access.",
      "The House Ethics Committee launched into allegations of misconduct against Gaetz in April 2021, but deferred its consideration in response to a request from the Justice Department. It resumed its investigation in May 2023 after federal investigators declined to charge Gaetz following their sex-trafficking and obstruction probe.",
      "In June, the Ethics Committee said \"certain allegations merit continued review\" after it issued more than two dozen subpoenas and spoke with more than a dozen witnesses. The panel said it was looking into claims Gaetz engaged in sexual misconduct and illicit drug use, accepted improper gifts, gave \"special privileges and favors\" to people close to him and sought to obstruct government investigations into his conduct.",
      "The former congressman has denied any wrongdoing and has called the ethics investigation a \"smear.\" Alex Pfeiffer, a spokesman for Trump's transition, said in a statement Monday that \"Matt Gaetz will be the next Attorney General. He's the right man for the job and will end the weaponization of our justice system. These are baseless allegations intended to derail the second Trump administration.\"",
      "A lawyer for two women who spoke with the Ethics Committee told CBS News on Monday that they testified that Gaetz paid them directly and repeatedly for sex, and said Venmo transactions for the encounters were obtained by the panel.",
      "The attorney, Joel Leppard, also said the women told House investigators that Gaetz asked about \"party favors\" and \"vitamins\" at upcoming parties via text messages, which was understood to be code for drugs. One of Leppard's clients testified before the Ethics Committee that she witnessed\u00a0 Gaetz having sex with a 17-year-old against a game table during a July 2017 party, months after he was sworn in as a House member.",

      "An advocate for imposing wide-ranging tariffs, Lutnick told CNBC in September that \"tariffs are an amazing tool for the president to use \u2014 we need to protect the American worker.\" During his campaign, Trump proposed a 60% tariff on goods from China \u2014 and a tariff of up to 20% on everything else the U.S. imports.",
      "\"I think we'll make a bunch of money on the tariffs,\" Lutnick said, \"but mostly, everybody else is going to negotiate with us, and we will be more fair.\"",
      "Mainstream economists are generally skeptical of tariffs, considering them a mostly inefficient way for governments to raise money and promote prosperity.",

      "\"I won't touch them. They made themselves nuclear,\" Lutnick said in September.",
      "Lutnick, who's worked on Wall Street for over 30 years, has been with Cantor Fitzgerald since 1983 and became its president and CEO when he was 29 years old, in 1996. On 9/11, Cantor Fitzgerald lost about two-thirds of its New York-based workforce in the terrorist attacks, 658 employees in all, including Lutnick's brother. Lutnick survived the attack because he was late to work that day, dropping off his young son at his first day of school. In the years since the attack, Lutnick and the Cantor Fitzgerald Relief Fund have donated $180 million to 9/11 families, according to Trump's social media post on Lutnick's selection.",
      "Lutnick, who is also a cryptocurrency enthusiast, was also under consideration for treasury secretary, a role that has been at the center of high-profile jockeying within the Trump world. At the same time, the treasury position is closely watched in financial circles, where a disruptive nominee could have immediate negative consequences on the stock market, which Trump watches closely.",

    "summary": "As he gets ready to retire, GOP Rep. Brad Wenstrup often thinks about the day Rep. Steve Scalise, one of the House Republican leaders, was shot during a baseball practice.",
    "story": [
      "As Rep. Brad Wenstrup prepares for his retirement in six weeks, he often recalls one day in particular. He was prone on the ground, face down in the grass, with a baseball helmet on his head.",
      "The piercing sounds of screaming, gunfire and chaos surrounded him, persisting for several minutes. When it finally quieted, Wenstrup sprang to his feet and ran to his gravely injured colleague, GOP Rep. Steve Scalise of Louisiana, the House majority whip, a few hundred feet away.",
      "With each stride that day in June 2017, Wenstrup said he was consumed by the memories of Iraq from 12 years earlier. And as Wenstrup, a decorated combat surgeon, made his run along the field to provide help to his colleague, Wenstrup pictured the patient he and his surgical team were not able to save 12 years earlier.",
      "This time would be different, Wenstrup hoped.",
      "He not only helped save the patient, but along with emergency responders, played a key role in heading off a political assassination.",
      "Wenstrup, who was elected to Congress from suburban Cincinnati in 2012, helped treat Scalise, who had been shot by a gunman who opened fire at a House Republican baseball practice just before their 2017 annual congressional baseball game against Democrats.",
      "\"I saw the entry wound from the bullet, but I didn't see an exit wound, so I knew he was in trouble,\" Wenstrup said. \"I had no doubt he was bleeding internally. I knew that if I couldn't stop the bleeding, I at least needed to get him to drink fluids.\" He began applying pressure to slow the bleeding and talking to Scalise to keep him alert and conscious.",
      "Scalise had suffered a shot to his hip. His femur was shattered and his pelvis severely damaged.",
      "Scalise recalled some of the immediate aftermath of the shooting and of Wenstrup's care. He told CBS News, \"He was putting pressure on the spot where the bullet went in. He then ultimately put a tourniquet on. And you know, later, my trauma surgeon told me that tourniquet saved my life.\" Wenstrup had improvised a tourniquet with a belt and bandages to help slow the blood flow until Scalise was ushered away by emergency responders.",
      "After he was airlifted to George Washington University hospital for emergency surgery, Scalise would spend several days unconscious. Grueling rehabilitation and reconstructive surgeries helped Scalise walk again.",
      "With little fanfare last year, Wenstrup announced his retirement from Congress, which takes effect Jan. 3, 2025. Amid a wave of retirements of longtime members of Congress and a sea change in Washington after the 2024 elections, Wenstrup's departure has been overlooked by some.",
      "But not by Scalise or by many of Wenstrup's House colleagues.",
      "\"He's such a man of high integrity,\" Scalise told CBS News. \"He's respected by his colleagues. He's a chairman of a committee. He could have done even more things here in Congress, and his constituents would have elected him overwhelmingly. But he also knew it's time.\"",
      "The man who opened fire on Scalise and his fellow Republicans was killed after an exchange of gunfire with a Capitol Police protective detail assigned to Scalise, who was given an additional protection as a member of House leadership. Gunman James Hodgkinson acted alone and was not connected to terrorism, federal investigators determined. He was carrying an SKS rifle and a 9 mm handgun when he opened fire.",
      "Wenstrup is haunted by thoughts of the carnage that could have ensued if Scalise and the police unit had not been at the practice to protect the group.",
      "\"There were 136 rounds fired. I don't think most people know that,\" Wenstrup said. \"If Steve Scalise wasn't there and didn't take a bullet for all of us, then there's no (security) detail there.\" Wenstrup said the gunman could have killed 20 to 30 members of Congress and staff.\"",
      "As he performed the initial emergency medical triage on Scalise, Wenstrup recalled eerily similar images from 12 years earlier, when he was deployed as a military doctor at Abu Ghraib in Iraq. He served in the U.S. Army Reserves in Iraq in the months before the troop surge. One day, a soldier was grievously wounded nearby and was rushed to Wenstrup's post for surgery.",
      "Wenstrup said the victim was a servicemember who had likely been hit by an improvised explosive device. \u00a0 \"He was badly hit. There was no doubt about it, but he was still alive, and he was intubated and on the table,\" Wenstrup recalled, sitting back in his chair and lowering the volume of his voice as he shared the account.",
      "\"It was a blunt injury. There severed arteries internally and his blood pressure started dropping,\" Wenstrup said, \"We opened him up, went in and there was blood everywhere. And we couldn't stop. We couldn't stop it.\"",
      "\"We were just really distraught after that one,\" Wenstrup said. \"And that was going through my mind when I was with (Scalise) on that field.\"",
      "He urged arriving medics to rush an IV to Scalise, to ensure he stayed hydrated. The flashbacks to Iraq and 2005 continued. But this was different from that patient 12 years earlier, Wenstrup told himself. Scalise had not suffered the same blunt force trauma.",
      "In a 2018 interview with CBS' \"60 Minutes,\" Scalise recalled, \"In a weird way, your body kind of goes numb. You know, as bad as the wounds were, and obviously I know now how severe it was. At the time, I guess my body had been shutting down a lot of the real pain. And I was just thinking about what was going on at the moment.\"",

      "Wenstrup's efforts to help save Scalise also had an untold impact on America, averting a would-be assassination and any cascading impact it would have inflicted upon the nation.",
      "Wenstrup said he and Scalise were casual acquaintances before the shooting. They later became friends \u2014 and roommates at a house in Washington, D.C., sharing a living quarters on days when Congress is in session.",
      "\"We are just very, very tight in our friendship,\" Scalise told CBS News. \"I've really gotten to know him and his wife. They're just wonderful people.\"",
      "Wenstrup's congressional career is ending amid uniquely toxic politics in the House. His departure comes as members of Congress complain of a loss of civility and cross-party relationships.

      "But Wenstrup has engaged in some heated political battles, including in the closing months of his career. In June, a House subcommittee chaired by Wenstrup, held a charged and animated hearing questioning Dr. Anthony Fauci, focusing on Fauci's response to the COVID pandemic.",
      "Wenstrup accused Fauci of running an office that was \"unaccountable to the American people.\" Wenstrup's panel pursued Fauci's personal emails and staged a two-day, 14-hour closed door deposition that Wenstrup characterized as \"cordial\" but pressing.",
      "Democrats accused Wenstrup's subcommittee of spreading misinformation about Fauci. The subcommittee's ranking Democrat, Rep. Raul Ruiz of California, said in his opening statement, \"After 15 months, the select subcommittee still does not possess a shred of evidence to substantiate these extreme allegations that Republicans have levied against Dr. Fauci for nearly four years.\"",
      "Sitting at a small table in the lobby of his office suite in the Rayburn House Office Building, Wenstrup recalled his blistering testimony during hearings into the formation of the House Jan. 6 select committee, which investigated the Capitol siege.",
      "Wenstrup criticized Democratic leaders for not including a review of the baseball field shooting in the Jan. 6 committee's work. \"If the shooting killed 20 to 30 members of Congress, it would have changed the balance of power in the House of Representatives against the will of the people. That's an insurrection. You're throwing around that word? That's an insurrection, I said. So, if you're truly interested in protecting this beautiful Capitol and those who work in here, then we should make this part of this commission as well.\"",
      "Many of the other congressional Republicans who were on the field at the 2017 baseball practice shooting have long since departed, including those who were defeated in elections or retired. Gov. Ron DeSantis, who represented Florida, and former Sen. Jeff Flake of Arizona are among those who have left.",
      "Wenstrup's colleagues gave him a standing ovation on the House floor in September 2017, when Scalise returned to duties at the Capitol.",
      "But Wenstrup's retirement contributes to an unexpected dynamic. Among the officeholders from the shooting spree who are still in the House is the man who was hit. Scalise is expected to serve another term in 2025 as the House majority leader.",

    "summary": "Dr. Mehmet Oz unsuccessfully ran for Senate in 2022. Now he's Trump's choice to lead the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President-elect Donald Trump announced Tuesday that he has selected Dr. Mehmet Oz\u00a0\u2014 a celebrity heart surgeon who hosted a daytime television show \u2014 to lead the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.",
      "The agency falls under the Department of Health and Human Services and oversees Medicare, the federal portion of the Medicaid program, the Children's Health Insurance Program and the federal health insurance marketplace. Trump has selected Robert F. Kennedy Jr. for secretary of Health and Human Services. Both positions require Senate confirmation.",
      "\"America is facing a health care crisis, and there may be no physician more qualified and capable than Dr. Oz to make America healthy again,\" Trump said in a statement. \"He is an eminent physician, heart surgeon, inventor, and world-class communicator, who has been at the forefront of healthy living for decades.\"",
      "The president-elect said Oz will work with Kennedy, if he is confirmed, \"to take on the illness industrial complex, and all the horrible chronic diseases left in its wake.\" He also indicated there may be cuts to CMS, writing that Oz \"will also cut waste and fraud within our country's most expensive government agency, which is a third of our nation's healthcare spend, and a quarter of our entire national budget.\"",
      "More than 100 million Americans participate in the major programs that CMS oversees \u2014 Medicare, Medicaid and CHIP \u2014 according to the agency.",
      "Oz ran for Senate in 2022 in Pennsylvania and received Trump's endorsement, but was\u00a0defeated by Democratic Sen. John Fetterman.",
      "Asked about the pick by CBS News on Tuesday, Fetterman said he would be open to confirming his former opponent.",
      "\"He's going to have a hearing, and then we're going to find out what he's about,\" Fetterman said. \"I'm not going to have like, a knee jerk, 'well, no, just because he said to mean things to me in an election or whatever' \u2014 we're all professionals. We got to move on that. And if he meets my criteria then I'll vote for him.\"",
      "Years before mounting his Senate run, he came under scrutiny by Congress for featuring on his show unproven \"miracle\" weight-loss supplements. During a Senate committee hearing in June 2014, lawmakers accused Oz of misleading consumers about one of those supplements, a green coffee bean extract that he promoted on his eponymous daytime television show.",

    "published": "Tue, 19 Nov 2024 18:09:55 -0500",
    "summary": "Brendan Carr wrote Project 2025's chapter on overhauling the Federal Communications Commission. Here's what to know.",
    "story": [
      "President-elect Donald Trump's pick to run the Federal Communications Commission, Brendan Carr, will oversee the agency that regulates U.S. internet access and communications networks such as TV and radio. Carr believes it's an institution ripe for change,\u00a0 according to the chapter he wrote in Project 2025 about the FCC.",
      "Carr will be stepping into the role of FCC Chair after serving as one of its five commissioners since 2017, when Trump nominated him to the role during his first administration. Prior to that, Carr served as the agency's general counsel.",
      "The FCC may not be a household name to most Americans, but the agency enforces communications laws, runs programs to help communities gain access to high-speed internet and regulates communications services, including satellite internet access, among other tasks. But under Carr, the agency may pivot to some new priorities during Trump's next term, with a renewed focus on battling big technology companies and Chinese-based telecom firms.",
      "\"The FCC needs to change course and bring new urgency to achieving four main goals,\" including \"reining in Big Tech,\" Carr wrote in his chapter on the FCC in Project 2025, a policy blueprint published by the Heritage Foundation.",
      "Here's what to know about Carr's priorities.",
      "How might the FCC deal with tech giants?",
      "In Project 2025, Carr highlighted what he believes is a need for a new approach to dealing with tech giants such as Google, Meta and others.",
      "\"Today, a handful of corporations can shape everything from the information we consume to the places we shop,\" Carr wrote in the document. \"These corporate behemoths are not merely exercising market power, they are abusing dominant positions.\"",
      "The FCC should restrict immunity from Section 230, part of a law that says tech companies aren't liable if a user posts something libelous, as well as tamp down the businesses' ability to \"censor protected speech while maintaining their Section 230 protections,\" he wrote.",
      "Carr also wants tech companies to be more transparent about their algorithm changes and their decisions to block or demonetize users.",
      "What are Carr's views on Elon Musk?",
      "Carr has built an alliance with billionaire Musk, the world's wealthiest person who backed Trump's campaign and whose Starlink satellite internet service could benefit from access to federal cash.",
      "In a Tuesday interview with Fox News, Carr pointed to Musk as an example of how the federal government doesn't treat people fairly, noting that a grant of almost $900 million to Musk's Starlink was \"revoked unlawfully.\" Last year, the FCC said it rejected the grant because of lack of proof that Starlink would be able to provide service to hundreds of thousands of rural properties.",
      "\"It is time for the American government to not give people different treatment based on their last name,\" Carr told Fox News. \"Everybody will get a fair shake from the government going forward.\"",
      "What about his views on TikTok and Chinese businesses?",
      "In his Project 2025 chapter, Carr singled out TikTok and other Chinese-owned businesses as potential threats to U.S. security.",
      "\"As law enforcement officials have made clear, TikTok poses a serious and unacceptable risk to America's national security,\" Carr wrote. \"It also provides Beijing with an opportunity to run a foreign influence campaign by determining the news and information that the app feeds to millions of Americans.\"",
      "That would align his views along those with the Biden administration, with the president\u00a0signing a law in April that would require TikTok to be sold or else banned from the U.S.",
      "Carr also wrote that he believes the FCC needs to do more to monitor and restrict Chinese telecom and tech businesses from operating within the U.S.",
      "What does Carr say about broadcasters?",
      "Carr has taken aim at some broadcasters, including CBS News, echoing Trump's claims that they engage in political bias. For instance, Carr singled out NBC for including Trump's Democratic rival, Kamala Harris, in a \"Saturday Night Live\" skit before the election.",
      "\"This is a clear and blatant effort to evade the FCC's Equal Time rule,\" Carr wrote on X on November 2. \"The purpose of the rule is to avoid exactly this type of biased and partisan conduct \u2014 a licensed broadcaster using the public airwaves to exert its influence for one candidate on the eve of an election.\"",
      "After Trump announced Carr's pick, Carr said on X that he will ensure the FCC \"will enforce\" laws that call on broadcasters \"to operate in the public interest.\"",
      "Trump has repeatedly called to strip major broadcasters such as ABC, NBC and CBS of their licenses. During the 2024 campaign, Trump\u00a0sued CBS News\u00a0over a \"60 Minutes\" interview with Harris, alleging the network used \"deceitful\" editing of her responses. CBS News has called the president-elect's claims \"completely without merit\" and added it intended to vigorously defend against the lawsuit.",
      "What do supporters and critics say about Carr?",
      "Trump praised Carr as \"a warrior for Free Speech\" in a statement announcing his selection. Fellow FCC Commissioner Geoffrey Starks, a Democrat, described Carr as \"a dedicated public servant and a recognized leader on the many issues before the Commission today.\"",
      "But some critics have flagged some of Carr's stances, with the nonpartisan public interest group Free Press describing his relationship with Musk as well as his stance on broadcasters as problematic.",
      "\"While styling himself as a free-speech champion, Carr refused to stand up when Trump threatened to take away the broadcast licenses of TV stations for daring to fact check him during the campaign,\" Free Press Action Co-CEO Craig Aaron said in a statement. \"This alone should be disqualifying.\"",
      "Free Press and Fight for the Future, an advocacy group focused on digital rights, both have cited concerns about net neutrality, a policy that ensures internet service providers treat all websites and online content equally. Net neutrality was overturned during the first Trump administration, but was restored during Biden's term.",
      "\"Trump's nomination of Brendan Carr, one of the co-authors of Project 2025, to head the FCC is more than just a reversal of popular policies like net neutrality,\" said Evan Greer, director of Fight for the Future, said in an email. \"Carr has made clear he actually wants the FCC to get more involved in policing online speech.\"",

    "summary": "The Senate has confirmed 217 of Mr. Biden's selections to serve on the federal bench and are aiming to approve more before Republicans take control.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 As Senate Democrats work to push through President Biden's remaining nominees to the nation's courts before he leaves office and control of the upper chamber flips, they are bumping up against efforts by their Republican colleagues to slow down the pace of confirmations, amid President-elect Donald Trump's urging that his party \"hold the line.\"",
      "Mr. Biden and Trump have made judicial nominations a priority in their respective terms in office, as courts become the arbiters of politically charged disputes over issues that affect all corners of American life.",
      "During his first term in office, the Senate confirmed 234 of Trump's judicial nominees to the Article III courts, which include the Supreme Court, federal appeals courts, district courts and U.S. Court of International Trade. But Mr. Biden is fast approaching that number for his four years in office, with the Senate approving 217 of his candidates for the federal bench so far. There are 44 current vacancies, and 14 nominees awaiting action by the upper chamber, according to the Judicial Conference.",
      "Democrats are hoping to meet or surpass Trump's 234 judicial confirmations during the lame-duck session, but have encountered resistance from Republicans \u2014 who, egged on by Trump \u2014 looking to hold up and drag out the process.",
      "When the Senate convened for votes Monday, Republicans used procedural maneuvers to drag out the floor proceedings, slowing Democrats' efforts to confirm Mr. Biden's judicial picks. The plan to slow down the confirmations was orchestrated by Sen. John Thune of South Dakota, who was elected last week to serve as the next GOP leader, according to Fox News.",
      "\"If Sen. Schumer thought Senate Republicans would just roll over and allow him to quickly confirm multiple Biden-appointed judges to lifetime jobs in the final weeks of the Democrat majority, he thought wrong,\" Thune said in a statement.",
      "Trump is also pushing Senate Republicans to thwart Democrats' efforts to continue approving Mr. Biden's judicial picks.",
      "\"The Democrats are trying to stack the courts with radical left judges on their way out the door,\" he wrote on social media. \"Republican senators need to show up and hold the line \u2014 no more judges confirmed before inauguration day!\"",
      "But Democrats are not breaking new ground by confirming Mr. Biden's judicial nominees during the lame-duck session. In 2020, after Trump lost his bid for reelection, the GOP-led Senate confirmed 19 candidates to the federal bench, including one judge to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 7th Circuit and four to the U.S. Court of Federal Claims.",
      "Among those who won approval in the weeks after the 2020 election was U.S. District Judge Kathryn Mizelle, who at 33 years old was the youngest of Trump's nominees and was deemed \"not qualified\" to serve on the district court by the American Bar Association. U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon, who tossed out the criminal case against Trump for his alleged mishandling of sensitive documents, was also confirmed by the Senate after the 2020 election.",
      "\"Delaying the confirmation of highly qualified, experienced judges takes a real-life toll on constituents and leads to backlogs of criminal cases \u2013 meaning Senator Thune was correct in 2020 when he said senators have every urgent reason to continue working together in good faith to staff the federal bench,\" Andrew Bates, White House spokesperson, said of the efforts to gum-up the confirmation process. \"There is no excuse for choosing partisanship over enforcing the rule of law.\"",
      "Advocacy groups are pressuring Senate Democrats to continue to hold votes to approve all of the president's remaining nominees to the federal bench before Trump takes office in late January and Republicans claim the majority in the Senate.",
      "On Friday, the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights and 141 groups sent a letter to senators urging them to confirm all pending judicial nominees, calling it \"urgent and enduring.\"",
      "\"We implore you to stay in and do this necessary work,\" the organizations said. \"It is essential that we leave no judges behind.\"",
      "Demand Justice, a progressive judicial advocacy group, also launched a campaign aimed at pressuring senators to green-light Mr. Biden's picks for the federal courts.",
      "\"With only weeks left before the new Congress, it's more urgent than ever that Democratic senators do whatever it takes \u2014 staying late, working weekends \u2014 during the lame duck session to confirm the dozens of remaining fair-minded, qualified judges nominated by President Biden that the American people deserve,\" said Maggie Jo Buchanan, managing director of Demand Justice.",
      "Senate Democrats are unbowed by Republicans' efforts and have indicated they will charge ahead with confirming Mr. Biden's judicial picks.",
      "Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer stressed Tuesday that Democrats \"are not done yet,\" and said his party will do what it can to \"get as many judges confirmed as we can.\"",
      "\"Everyone should be prepared for another late night on Wednesday to vote on nominations and get as many judges done as possible,\" the New York Democrat said, adding that Republicans \"can try dilatory tactics but we're going to persist, as we showed last night, as we're persisting now.\"",
      "Sen. Dick Durbin, the Democratic whip who also chairs the Judiciary Committee, celebrated the judges brought forward by the committee over the last four years of Democratic control, noting that the vast majority of the judges that the Senate has considered are bipartisan, winning support from Republicans.",
      "But some Republicans didn't see them that way, such as Sen. John Kennedy of Louisiana, who argued that many of Mr. Biden's nominees \"are not qualified to be on the federal bench\" and called them \"activists.\"",
      "Still, Senate Republicans acknowledge that they can't block the judicial picks across the board as Trump has requested. Sen. Pete Ricketts, a Nebraska Republican, said that although Republicans would like to deliver on Trump's wishes, \"Democrats are in the majority, and even if we have all of our members here, we still can't prevent that, as long as they have all their members.\"",

    "story": [
      "President-elect Donald Trump's six-year New York criminal odyssey\u00a0might need to continue for at least another four, prosecutors said Tuesday.",
      "Lawyers for Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg wrote in a letter to Justice Juan Merchan that Trump should not be sentenced for his crimes until after he completes his second term in office. That would be the year 2029, more than a decade after the investigation into Trump's coverup of a \"hush money\" payment began.",
      "\"Consideration must be given to various non-dismissal options that may address any concerns raised by the pendency of a post-trial criminal proceeding during the presidency, such as deferral of all remaining criminal proceedings until after the end of defendant's upcoming presidential term,\" the filing said.",
      "Merchan had been slated to rule on Nov. 12 on whether presidential immunity should have prevented jurors from seeing certain evidence at Trump's trial this spring, but he postponed his decision. Merchan said he wanted to hear from prosecutors about how to proceed with the case, which entered uncharted terrain when Trump was reelected president.",
      "Prosecutors said in their filings that they intend to oppose any effort by Trump to dismiss his case outright. Trump's lawyers said in a previous letter that they would do so, claiming his election meant the case might cause \"unconstitutional impediments to President Trump's ability to govern.\"",
      "Prosecutors said in the short term, they are also unopposed to delaying Trump's sentencing, currently on the schedule for Nov. 26, while his attorneys awaiting and responding to his motion to dismiss.",
      "Trump is the first person in American history to win the presidency after being convicted of crimes. He was also the first former president to face trial for crimes.",
      "Trump promised minutes after a unanimous jury found him guilty of felonies in May to fight his conviction. Weeks later, the Supreme Court ruled former presidents are immune from prosecution for official acts and that evidence related to Trump's work as president could not be used at trial.",
      "Trump's lawyers argued the Supreme Court's ruling meant the conviction should be set aside, and his sentencing canceled. They said jurors heard testimony from former White House staff that should have been out of bounds during the trial. The legal team was led by Todd Blanche and Emil Bove, who Trump has said he will appoint next year to senior posts in the U.S. Department of Justice.",
      "Bragg's office has argued that the material protested by Trump's team was \"a sliver of the mountains\" of evidence the jury considered \u2013 so small it shouldn't mean tossing aside the jury's decision.",
      "The jury found that Trump committed 34 felonies, largely by authorizing a plan to conceal reimbursements to Michael Cohen, his former attorney and fixer. Cohen paid $130,000 to adult film star Stormy Daniels, days before the 2016 presidential election, in exchange for her silence about an alleged sexual encounter with Trump. The payment has often been referred to as a \"hush money\" payment.",
      "Trump insists he is not guilty of falsifying business records \u2014 the charge he was convicted on \u2014 and has vehemently denied Daniels' story.",
      "The Manhattan District Attorney's Office, then led by Cyrus Vance Jr., began investigating the \"hush money\" deal in 2018. It soon widened into an expansive probe into Trump's finances. Trump assailed the investigation during his first presidency, fighting a subpoena to the Supreme Court, which in a landmark 2020 decision allowed the office to get Trump's tax returns.",
      "When Bragg took office in 2022, he pared down the investigation, refocusing it on the \"hush money\" deal. A grand jury indicted Trump on March 31, 2023 and his trial began in April of this year.",

    "published": "Tue, 19 Nov 2024 11:35:00 -0500",
    "summary": "The move by the president to adjourn Congress to make recess appointments would create a new precedent, experts say, affecting the way presidents see presidential power going forward.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President-elect Donald Trump has selected for some of the top roles in his administration controversial picks who may not win universal support from Republican senators. He can only afford to lose a few Republicans in the confirmation process, but he's opened the door to the possibility of forgoing the traditional route altogether, utilizing a Constitutional power known as recess appointments to effectively bypass the Senate \u2014 and swiftly approve his nominees.",
      "The possible strategy, raised by Trump in a post on social media last week, has generated mixed reviews among senators, who would stand to forfeit their key advice and consent role. And the president-elect made it something of a litmus test for Senate leadership as Republicans won majority control in the November elections.",
      "What is a recess appointment?",
      "Though the Senate is tasked with an advice and consent role in the confirmation process, the Constitution's Recess Appointment Clause affords the president the ability to temporarily fill vacancies while the Senate is in recess, and appointees may stay in the role until the end of the following session.",
      "The recess appointments power \"was built for a time when the Senate was not meeting year round,\" says Casey Burgat, the director of the Legislative Affairs Program at George Washington University's Graduate School of Political Management.",
      "\"You were coming from all states, travel was a problem, and horses and carriages, and they would be out of session more often than they were in session,\" Burgat says. \" And so to ensure that the government can continue its work, they gave the president appointment power to name, within recess, someone to take the place.\"",
      "More recently, recess appointments have been used by presidents including President George W. Bush, Bill Clinton and Barack Obama \u2014 Bush and Clinton made over 100 recess appointments \u2014 although they were generally used to fill positions below the Cabinet level. In 2014, the Supreme Court weighed in on a challenge to a handful of Obama appointments, giving the Senate more authority to prevent the maneuver and determining that the chamber must be away for 10 days for recess appointments to occur.",
      "In recent years, the Senate has used pro-forma sessions to gavel in even when the chamber is on recess in part to avoid recess appointments. And paired with the elimination of a 60-vote threshold for nominees in 2013 \u2014 making it easier for the majority to make confirmations \u2014 recess appointments haven't been made in about a decade.",
      "But that could change in Trump's second term. Under the Constitution, both chambers have to agree to adjourn for three days or more. And at Trump's urging, House and Senate Republicans, who are set to narrowly control both chambers in the new Congress, may agree to do so.",
      "Sen. John Thune, a South Dakota Republican who last week was elected to serve as Senate majority leader in the new Congress, said \"all options are on the table\" to swiftly approve Trump's nominees after he takes office, including recess appointments. He's suggested that while the typical confirmation process is preferred, if Senate Democrats obstruct the confirmation proceedings, Republicans may have to resort to other options.",
      "Still, pushback from just a handful of Republicans who oppose the recess appointment effort \u2014\u00a0 which would undermine their ability to study nominees, request documents and have a hearing \u2014 could block the move to put the chamber in recess. But experts say Trump could move to adjourn Congress anyway.",
      "Could Trump adjourn Congress to make recess appointments?",
      "The Constitution outlines that a president may adjourn the House and Senate in the case of \"Disagreement between them, with Respect to the Time of Adjournment.\" So if one chamber approves a resolution to adjourn and the other votes it down, Trump could theoretically weigh in and declare Congress in recess.",
      "But some experts say that what constitutes a disagreement between the chambers could be interpreted differently, due to the unprecedented nature of the approach, questioning whether a simple lack of action from one chamber after the other approves a resolution to adjourn may be viewed as disagreement.",
      "\"It's not clear at all how this would work,\" says Matt Glassman, a senior fellow at the Government Affairs Institute at Georgetown University, noting that the issue is something that almost certainly would result in litigation.",
      "Glassman said in a scenario where the House tries to force the Senate out of session to make recess appointments, \"it's not clear to me the court is going to like the idea of the president and the House conspiring to end run the Senate on nominations.\"",
      "Trump is \"threatening to turn the Constitution's appointment process for Cabinet officers on its head\" with the recess appointments strategy, Edward Whelan, a senior fellow at the conservative Ethics and Public Policy Center, warned in an op-ed in the Washington Post. He urged that House Speaker Mike Johnson, who would be a key player in Trump's ability to unilaterally adjourn Congress, \"can and should immediately put an end to this scheme.\"",
      "But Johnson on Sunday left the door open to the strategy, saying on Fox News when asked whether he would take steps to put Congress in recess that a president should be able to \"choose his team,\" and \"if this thing bogs down, it would be a great detriment to the country.\" But he acknowledged that he's \"very hopeful\" the Senate will do its job and move the nominees along.",
      "The move by the president to adjourn Congress to make recess appointments would create a new precedent, experts say, affecting the way presidents see presidential power going forward.",
      "\"When they may see a power deferred to them, they're very reluctant to give it back going forward,\" Burgat says. \"The minute you cross the red line, all of a sudden, that red line looks like it didn't matter at all in the first place.\"",

      "President-elect Donald Trump said Monday he is naming former Wisconsin Rep. Sean Duffy as his nominee for transportation secretary, as he continues to roll out picks for his Cabinet.",
      "Duffy is a former reality TV star who was one of Trump's most visible defenders on cable news \u2014 a prime concern for the media-focused president-elect. Duffy served in the House for nearly nine years, was a member of the Financial Services Committee and chairman of the subcommittee on insurance and housing. He left Congress in 2019, and is co-host of \"The Bottom Line\" on Fox Business.",
      "In his announcement, Trump noted that Duffy is married to a Fox News host, calling him \"the husband of a wonderful woman, Rachel Campos-Duffy, a STAR on Fox News.\"",
      "Duffy is so far the second Fox-affiliated television host that Trump has named to his Cabinet. Trump last week announced his choice of Fox News host Pete Hegseth to serve as his defense secretary.",
      "Trump said Duffy would use his experience and relationships built over the years in Congress \"to maintain and rebuild our Nation's Infrastructure, and fulfill our Mission of ushering in The Golden Age of Travel, focusing on Safety, Efficiency, and Innovation. Importantly, he will greatly elevate the Travel Experience for all Americans!\"",
      "Duffy in 2022 ruled out a run for Wisconsin governor despite pleas from Trump to make a bid, saying he needed to care for his nine children, including his youngest child who had a heart condition.",
      "He is a former lumberjack athlete and frequent Fox News contributor. He was featured on MTV's \"The Real World: Boston\" in 1997. He met his wife on the set of MTV's \"Road Rules: All Stars\" in 1998.",
      "A reality television background before politics is not unusual in Trump's world. The former president launched his political career after his hit reality show, \"The Apprentice.\"",
      "Duffy, after his time on reality television, worked as a special prosecutor and Ashland County district attorney. He won election to Congress as part of a tea party wave in 2010.",

      "He served until resigning in 2019.",
      "The Transportation Department oversees the nation's complex transportation system, including pipelines, railroads, cars, trucks, the airlines and mass transit systems as well as federal funding for highways.",
      "If confirmed, Duffy would take over at a time of tremendous change, especially on the nation's highways. Traffic deaths remain near record highs at a time when new technologies are being introduced that could help make the roads safer. Multiple companies are deploying autonomous robotaxis and even driverless semis with no specific federal regulations. And the nascent move from gasoline to electric vehicles presents safety problems of its own, especially with battery fires that can be difficult to extinguish.",
      "The department includes the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, which regulates automakers, including Elon Musk's Tesla. The department sets fuel economy standards for cars and trucks and regulates the airline industry through the Federal Aviation Administration, which is grappling with a shortage of air traffic controllers to ensure the safe and orderly flow of air travel.",

      "\"Congressman Duffy has a proven track record for getting things done, and we are eager to collaborate with him on key issues impacting the U.S. airline industry,\" Calio said.",
      "Trump has criticized electric vehicles as expensive and unreliable and called President Joe Biden's policy to promote them \"lunacy. He also has said EV manufacturing will destroy auto industry jobs and has falsely claimed that battery-powered cars don't work in cold weather and are unable to travel long distances.",
      "Trump has softened his rhetoric about electric vehicles in recent months after Musk endorsed him and campaigned heavily for his election.",
      "Even so, industry officials expect Trump to try to slow a shift to electric cars, and a tax credit for EV purchases is reportedly among those the Trump administration may seek to eliminate next year.",
      "Trump, in his statement, said Duffy would \"prioritize Excellence, Competence, Competitiveness and Beauty when rebuilding America's highways, tunnels, bridges and airports.\" Trump, as he campaigned for the White House, would sometimes complain about the state of air travel in particular, lamenting that the nation's \"once-revered airports\" are a \"dirty, crowded mess.\"",

      "\"We're looking for the ripe cones on the top of the tree,\" said Brian Kittler, chief program officer for the Resilient Forests program at the nonprofit conservation group American Forests.",
      "Using lift operators and climbers, Kittler and his team showed CBS News how his team hunts for pine cones.",
      "\"The more that we lose forest, we're losing our clean air and clean water, our ability to remove carbon from the atmosphere and address climate change,\" Kittler said.",
      "The threat comes from the West's unprecedented breed of megafires which, fueled by climate change, have destroyed more than 33 million acres since 2020, according to the National Interagency Fire Center. That's around the size of the state of Arkansas.",
      "If nothing is done to restore a forest after a wildfire, a vicious cycle begins. Fewer surviving trees means fewer pine cones for humans to pick and plant. That's what happened in the Fremont-Winema National Forest during the Barry Point Fire in 2012, Kittler said.",
      "\"There's basically no live trees, and there's no natural regeneration happening,\" Kittler said.",
      "Once the pine cones are collected, they're brought to a network of nurseries, where the seeds are extracted and grown into seedlings. One million seedlings will plant about 4,500 acres of new forest.",
      "But the program alone is not enough to restore the forest, said Brian Reatini, a geneticist with the U.S. Forest Service. He says they're short about 200,000 acres \u2014 and that's just in one part of Oregon.",
      "The warming environment also means fewer seedlings will likely grow to maturity, which takes about 20 years.",
      "\"It's become much more arid, hotter and dryer. One of the consequences of that, it can push trees towards the edge of what they can physiologically tolerate,\" Reatini said.",
      "To help combat that problem, they're sourcing seeds from more \"drought tolerant\" tree species.",

So if we're able to replant our little block of land, but we're surrounded by untreated, burned forest land, eventually that's just gonna become a brush field and it will burn again and threaten our land again,\" said Galen Smith, the company's vice president of resources.",

      "Giraffe populations are in trouble \u2014 and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service on Wednesday proposed listing three subspecies of the tall animals as endangered and two species as threatened under the Endangered Species Act.",
      "Their populations have been declining because of poaching, habitat loss and climate change, officials said. While giraffes are not native to the U.S., listing them under the act would still provide protections to giraffe populations.",
      "The Endangered Species Act, enacted in 1973, establishes protections for fish, wildlife and plants that are listed as threatened or endangered. Under the act, federal agencies are required to ensure their actions are unlikely to jeopardize listed species, according to the agency.",
      "\"Federal protections for giraffes will help protect a vulnerable species, foster biodiversity, support ecosystem health, combat wildlife trafficking, and promote sustainable economic practices,\" USFWS Director Martha Williams said in a press release. \"This action supports giraffe conservation while ensuring the United States does not contribute further to their decline.\"",
      "Specifically, officials said the listing would help giraffes by reducing the illegal hunting and trade of giraffes by requiring permits for import into the U.S. Trade is not the primary factor behind population decline, but it is playing a role, USFWS said. Their hair and tails have long been used in traditional medicine, the agency added, and in recent years giraffes have also been targeted by hunters for bushmeat.",
      "Listing them under the Endangered Species Act would also increase funding for species conservation in range countries and for research efforts to address conservation. It would also provide some limited financial support for developing and managing programs to conserve giraffes, the USFWS said.",
      "Giraffe subspecies from across Africa are at risk, according to the agency. The service proposed listing West African, Kordofan and Nubian giraffes as endangered. It also proposed listing Masai and reticulated giraffes as threatened.",
      "The West African, Kordofan and Nubian \u2014 all subspecies of the northern giraffe \u2014 have seen their population fall around 77% since 1985, according to federal officials. There are around 5,900 left, including only about 690 West African giraffes remain.",
      "The vast majority of reticulated giraffes live in Kenya, and their population is estimated at 15,985, according to USFWS. There are around 45,400 Masai giraffes \u2014 an amount roughly equivalent to 67% of their population in the 1970s.",
      "Giraffes feed on leaves, stems, flowers and fruits, so human population growth and habitat loss can hurt the species. Instances of drought have also led to increased human-wildlife conflicts.",

      "People trekked across the mudflats to see the whale, which NOAA biologists and staff from Alaska Veterinary Pathology Services had anchored to the shore Sunday so they would be able to gather samples from the animal. But even after samples are analyzed, it can be difficult to determine a cause of death because of decomposition or a lack of obvious injuries, Keogh said.",

      "Trump attends the SpaceX Starship launch",
      "Trump flew to Texas earlier in the afternoon and watched the launch and booster recovery with Musk. During a Sept. 21 campaign speech in Wilmington, North Carolina, Trump urged Musk to \"get those rocket ships going because we want to reach Mars before the end of my term. We want to do it.\"",
      "His reaction to watching the giant rocket take off and land was not immediately known.",
      "Ahead of the launch, Trump\u00a0posted\u00a0on social media: \"I'm heading to the Great State of Texas to watch the launch of the largest object ever to be elevated, not only to Space, but simply by lifting off the ground. Good luck to @ElonMusk and the Great Patriots involved in this incredible project!\"",
      "What's different about launch 6 than the previous 5 launches?",
      "As with the rocket's fifth test flight last month, the primary goals of Tuesday's flight was to boost the Starship out of the lower atmosphere on a sub-orbital flight to re-entry over the Indian Ocean while the Super Heavy booster executed the return-to-launch-site mid-air capture or, as it turned out, a safe ocean splashdown.",
      "But this time around, one of the Starship's methane-burning Raptor engines was successfully restarted in space to demonstrate the propulsion system's ability to perform critical maneuvers and future de-orbit burns.",
      "Engineers also were testing \"a suite of heatshield experiments and maneuvering changes for ship reentry and descent over the Indian Ocean,\" SpaceX said on its website, along with software and booster hardware upgrades intended to add additional propulsion system redundancy and increase the rocket's structural strength.",
      "Spectacular video from cameras mounted on the Starship showed a sheath of super-hot plasma engulfing the vehicle as it rapidly slowed in a blaze of atmospheric friction.",
      "And even though it was using an older-generation heat shield and flying in a deliberately more difficult-to-control orientation, the Starship executed a picture-perfect splashdown, firing three Raptors to slow down for a vertical descent into the ocean.",
      "The October test flight was the first featuring a successful launch pad \"catch\" and the first with a Starship that reached the Indian Ocean essentially intact.",
      "For Tuesday's flight, launch was moved to the late afternoon in Texas to ensure a daylight splashdown for video documentation.",
      "Plans for the Super Heavy-Starship",
      "The Super Heavy-Starship is the centerpiece of Musk's drive to develop a fully reusable heavy-lift rocket, which he says is the key to making humanity \"multi-planetary.\" And now, with Trump's support, he may be able to kick start that effort.",
      "Shortly after winning the presidential election, Trump announced that Musk and one-time presidential contender Vivek Ramaswamy would lead a new agency known as the Department of Government Efficiency. The goal, Trump said in a statement, is to \"dismantle government bureaucracy, slash excess regulation, cut wasteful expenditures and restructure federal agencies.\"",
      "Musk said in the same statement: \"This will send shockwaves through the system, and anyone involved in government waste, which is a lot of people.\"",
      "SpaceX already holds billions in government contracts and is building a variant of the Starship to serve as the initial lunar lander in NASA's Artemis moon program. It remains to be seen how Musk's role in the new administration might advance SpaceX's plans or how questions about conflicts of interest might be resolved.",
      "Politics aside, \"we are looking at a serious effort to return to the moon, and maybe a serious effort ... to send, if not humans to Mars in the next four years, a lot of stuff and a lot of infrastructure that will enable humans to get to Mars,\" said Casey Drier, director of space policy for the Planetary Society.",
      "\"Maybe not in four years, but maybe in the next 10.\"",
      "The key to those plans is the Super Heavy-Starship.",
      "How does the Super Heavy-Starship work?",
      "The Super Heavy booster is powered by 33 Raptor engines burning liquid methane and oxygen to generate more than 16 million pounds of thrust at full throttle, more than twice the liftoff power of NASA's legendary Saturn 5 moon rocket. The Starship is powered by six Raptors and will be capable of carrying astronauts, satellites and science probes.",
      "Like the company's workhorse Falcon 9 rocket, the 230-foot-tall first stage is designed to be fully reusable, flying itself back to the launch pad where giant \"chopsticks\" mounted on the pad gantry can catch the booster as it descends, enabling rapid servicing, re-fueling and launch.",
      "Unlike the Falcon 9, which uses a throw-away second stage, the 160-foot-tall Starship also is reusable, capable of safely returning to Earth after launching satellites or carrying astronauts to the moon and eventually, Musk says, to Mars.",
      "SpaceX already ferries astronauts and cosmonauts to and from the International Space Station using Falcon 9s carrying the company's Crew Dragon spacecraft and is building a variant of the Starship for NASA to carry astronauts back to the moon's surface in the 2026-27 timeframe.",
      "The company also launches commercial and military satellites, is building a powerful space tug for NASA to help drive the International Space Station safely out of orbit when the program is retired in 2030 and is launching thousands of its own Starlink satellites to provide global access to the internet.",
      "\"SpaceX functionally has the monopoly on access to space,\" said Drier. \"Pretty much any asset that you want to launch into space, whether you're the U.S. government or commercial provider, a satellite company, even the European Space Agency, they are all using SpaceX rockets.\"",

The first samples from that region facing away from Earth confirm an active history.",
      "The results were published Friday in the journal Science.",
      "China has launched several spacecraft to the moon. In 2020, the Chang'e-5 spacecraft returned moon rocks from the near side, the first since those collected by NASA's Apollo astronauts and Soviet Union spacecraft in the 1970s. The Chang'e-4 spacecraft became the first to visit the moon's far side in 2019.",
      "The moon's far side is pockmarked by craters and has fewer of the near side's flat, dark plains carved by lava flows. Why the two halves are so different remains a mystery, said study co-author Qiu-Li Li from the Chinese Academy of Sciences.",

      "When astronomy fans look to the sky this week, they'll get to see November's Beaver full moon, the last of 2024's four consecutive supermoons.",
      "The 2024 series of supermoons started in August with a rare supermoon blue moon. After this month's Beaver Moon, there won't be another supermoon until late next year.",
      "Why is the November full moon called the Beaver Moon?",
      "November's full moon is called the Beaver Moon, according to the Old Farmer's Almanac. The name was chosen because this is the time of year when beavers start sheltering in their lodges after having prepared food stores for the winter.",
      "This month's full moon also has several other names tied to winter and animals preparing for the cold weather. Other full names for the November full moon are the Frost Moon, the Freezing Moon, the Digging Moon, the Deer Rutting Moon and the Algonquin Whitefish Moon.",
      "When will the November supermoon be visible?",
      "The full moon is expected to reach its peak on Friday, Nov. 15, at 4:29 p.m. EST, NASA said. The Old Farmer's Almanac details specific moonrise times for different ZIP codes across the U.S.",
      "Around 96% of the moon's nearside will be illuminated by the sun on Thursday, according to NASA. By Friday, 100% of the moon's nearside will be illuminated. About 99% of it will be illuminated by the sun on Saturday and 96% of the moon will be illuminated on Sunday.",
      "You won't need binoculars or a telescope to enjoy the spectacular view.",
      "What makes supermoons special?",
      "A supermoon happens when the moon is simultaneously full and at the part of its orbit that's closest to Earth, according to NASA. The moon's distance from Earth varies between around 221,457 miles and 252,712 miles.",
      "During this month's supermoon, the moon will be about 224,385 miles from Earth.",

      "How can you spot a deepfake?",
      "Some deepfakes are easier to spot than others; there can be signs like unnatural lip movements or odd body language. But as the technology improves, it will get harder to tell just by looking.",
      "There are a growing number of websites claiming they can detect deepfakes. Using three known deepfake videos and three authentic ones, the CBS News Texas I-Team put five of these websites to an unscientific test: Deepware, Attestiv, DeepFake-O-Meter, Sensity and Deepfake Detector.",
      "In total, these five online tools correctly identified the tested videos nearly 75% of the time. The I-Team reached out to the companies with the results; their responses are below.",
      "Deepware",
      "Deepware, a website that's free to use, initially failed to flag two of the fake videos the I-Team tested. In an email, the company said the clips used were too short and that for the best results, videos uploaded should be between 30 seconds and one minute. Deepware correctly identified all videos that were longer. According to the company, its detection rate is considered good for the industry at 70%.",
      "The frequently asked questions section of Deepware's website states: \"Deepfakes are not a solved problem yet. Our results indicate the likelihood of a specific video being a deepfake or not.\"",
      "Deepfake Detector",
      "Deepfake Detector, a tool that charges $16.80 per month, identified one of the fake videos as \"97% natural voice.\" The company, which specializes in spotting AI-generated voices, said in an email that factors like background noise or music can impact results, but it has an accuracy rate of approximately 92%.",
      "In response to a question about guidance for average consumers, the company wrote: \"Our tool is designed to be user-friendly. Average consumers can easily upload an audio file on our website or use our browser extension to analyze content directly. The tool will provide an analysis to help determine if a video may contain deepfake elements using probabilities, making it accessible even for those unfamiliar with AI technology.\"",
      "Attestiv",
      "Attestiv flagged two of the real videos as \"suspicious.\" According to the company's CEO Nicos Vekiarides, false positives can be triggered by factors like graphics and edits. Both authentic videos flagged as \"suspicious\" included graphics and edits. The site offers a free service, but it also has a paid tier, where consumers can adjust settings and calibrations for more in-depth analysis.",
      "While he acknowledges that Attestiv isn't perfect, Vekiarides said that as deepfakes become harder to spot with the naked eye, these kinds of websites are needed as part of the solution.",
      "\"Our tool can determine if something is suspicious, and then you can verify it with your own eyes to say, 'I do think that's suspicious,'\" Vekiarides said.",
      "DeepFake-O-Meter",
      "DeepFake-O-Meter is another free tool supported by the University of Buffalo and the National Science Foundation. It identified two of the real videos as having a high percentage of being AI-generated.",
      "In an email, the creator of the open platform said a limitation of deepfake detection models is that video compression can lead to sync issues with video and audio and inconsistent mouth movements.",
      "In response to a question about how everyday users can use the tool, the company emailed: \"Currently, the main result shown to users is the probability value of this sample being a generated sample across different detection models. This can be used as a reference if multiple models agree on the same answer with confidence (e.g., over 80% for AI-generated or below 20% for real video).

    "published": "Wed, 20 Nov 2024 23:40:00 -0500",
    "summary": "The proposed breakup calls for Google to sell its industry-leading Chrome web browser and impose restrictions designed to prevent its Android smartphone software from favoring its search engine.",
    "story": [
      "U.S. regulators want a federal judge to break up Google to prevent the company from continuing to squash competition through its dominant search engine after a court found it had maintained an abusive monopoly over the past decade.",
      "The proposed breakup floated in a 23-page document filed late Wednesday by the U.S. Justice Department calls for Google to sell its industry-leading Chrome web browser and impose restrictions designed to prevent its Android smartphone software from favoring its search engine.",
      "The recommended penalties underscore how severely regulators operating under President Biden believe Google should be punished following an August ruling by U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta that branded Google as a monopolist. The Justice Department decision-makers who will inherit the case after President-elect Donald Trump takes office next year might not be as strident. The Washington, D.C. court hearings on Google's punishment are scheduled to begin in April and Mehta is aiming to issue his final decision before Labor Day.",
      "If Mehta embraces the Justice Department's recommendations, Google will almost certainly appeal the punishments, prolonging a legal tussle that has dragged on for more than four years.",
      "Besides seeking a Chrome spinoff and corralling of the Android software, the Justice Department wants the judge to ban Google from forging multibillion-dollar deals to lock in its dominant search engine as the default option on Apple's iPhone and other devices.",
      "Regulators also want Google to share data it collects from people's queries with its rivals, giving them a better chance at competing with the tech giant.",
      "The measures, if they are ordered, threaten to upend a business expected to generate more than $300 billion in revenue this year \u2014 a moneymaking machine that has given Google's parent company, Alphabet Inc.",
      "\"The playing field is not level because of Google's conduct, and Google's quality reflects the ill-gotten gains of an advantage illegally acquired,\" the Justice Department asserted in its recommendations. \"The remedy must close this gap and deprive Google of these advantages.\"",
      "It's still possible that the Justice Department could ease off attempts to break up Google, especially if Trump takes the widely expected step of replacing Jonathan Kanter, who was appointed by Biden to oversee the agency's antitrust division.",
      "Although the case targeting Google was originally filed during the final months of Trump's first term in office, Kanter oversaw the high-profile trial that culminated in Mehta's ruling against Google. Working in tandem with Federal Trade Commission Chair Lina Khan, Kanter took a get-tough stance against Big Tech that triggered other attempted crackdowns on industry powerhouses such as Apple and discouraged business deals from getting done during the past four years.",
      "Trump recently expressed concerns that a breakup might destroy Google but didn't elaborate on the alternative penalties he might have in mind. \"What you can do without breaking it up is make sure it's more fair,\" Trump said last month. Matt Gaetz, the former Republican congressman that Trump nominated to be the next U.S. Attorney General, has previously called for the breakup of Big Tech companies.",
      "Gaetz, a firebrand for Trump, faces a tough confirmation hearing.",
      "This latest filing gave Kanter and his team a final chance to spell out measures that they believe are needed to restore competition in search. It comes six weeks after Justice first floated the idea of a breakup in a preliminary outline of potential penalties.",
      "But Kanter's proposal is already raising questions about whether regulators seek to impose controls that extend beyond the issues covered in last year's trial, and \u2014 by extension \u2014 Mehta's ruling.",
      "Banning the default search deals that Google now pays more than $26 billion annually to maintain was one of the main practices that troubled Mehta in his ruling.",
      "It's less clear whether the judge will embrace the Justice Department's contention that Chrome needs to be spun out of Google and Android should be unbundled from the company's other services.",
      "Trying to break up Google harks back to a similar punishment initially imposed on Microsoft a quarter century ago following another major antitrust trial that culminated in a federal judge deciding the software maker had illegally used his Windows operating system for PCs to stifle competition.",

      "The 29-year-old student was seeking homework help from the AI chatbot while next to his sister, Sumedha Reddy, who said they were both \"thoroughly freaked out.\"",
      "\"I wanted to throw all of my devices out the window. I hadn't felt panic like that in a long time to be honest,\" she said.",
      "\"Something slipped through the cracks. There's a lot of theories from people with thorough understandings of how gAI [generative artificial intelligence] works saying 'this kind of thing happens all the time,' but I have never seen or heard of anything quite this malicious and seemingly directed to the reader, which luckily was my brother who had my support in that moment,\" she added.",
      "Her brother believes tech companies need to be held accountable for such incidents. \"I think there's the question of liability of harm. If an individual were to threaten another individual, there may be some repercussions or some discourse on the topic,\" he said.",
      "Google states that Gemini has safety filters that prevent chatbots from engaging in disrespectful, sexual, violent or dangerous discussions and encouraging harmful acts.",
      "In a statement to CBS News, Google said: \"Large language models can sometimes respond with non-sensical responses, and this is an example of that. This response violated our policies and we've taken action to prevent similar outputs from occurring.\"",
      "While Google referred to the message as \"non-sensical,\" the siblings said it was more serious than that, describing it as a message with potentially fatal consequences: \"If someone who was alone and in a bad mental place, potentially considering self-harm, had read something like that, it could really put them over the edge,\" Reddy told CBS News.",
      "It's not the first time Google's chatbots have been called out for giving potentially harmful responses to user queries. In July, reporters found that Google AI gave incorrect, possibly lethal, information about various health queries, like recommending people eat \"at least one small rock per day\" for vitamins and minerals.",
      "Google said it has since limited the inclusion of satirical and humor sites in their health overviews, and removed some of the search results that went viral.",
      "However, Gemini is not the only chatbot known to have returned concerning outputs.

      "Some users on Reddit and other discussion forums claim the response from Gemini may have been programmed through user manipulation \u2014 either by triggering a specific response, prompt injection, or altering the output.",
      "However, Reddy says he did nothing to incite the chatbot's response. Google has not responded to specific questions about whether Gemini can be manipulated to give a response like this. Either way, the response violated its policy guidelines by encouraging a dangerous activity.",

    "published": "Tue, 19 Nov 2024 18:09:55 -0500",
    "summary": "Brendan Carr wrote Project 2025's chapter on overhauling the Federal Communications Commission. Here's what to know.",
    "story": [
      "President-elect Donald Trump's pick to run the Federal Communications Commission, Brendan Carr, will oversee the agency that regulates U.S. internet access and communications networks such as TV and radio. Carr believes it's an institution ripe for change,\u00a0 according to the chapter he wrote in Project 2025 about the FCC.",
      "Carr will be stepping into the role of FCC Chair after serving as one of its five commissioners since 2017, when Trump nominated him to the role during his first administration. Prior to that, Carr served as the agency's general counsel.",
      "The FCC may not be a household name to most Americans, but the agency enforces communications laws, runs programs to help communities gain access to high-speed internet and regulates communications services, including satellite internet access, among other tasks. But under Carr, the agency may pivot to some new priorities during Trump's next term, with a renewed focus on battling big technology companies and Chinese-based telecom firms.",
      "\"The FCC needs to change course and bring new urgency to achieving four main goals,\" including \"reining in Big Tech,\" Carr wrote in his chapter on the FCC in Project 2025, a policy blueprint published by the Heritage Foundation.",
      "Here's what to know about Carr's priorities.",
      "How might the FCC deal with tech giants?",
      "In Project 2025, Carr highlighted what he believes is a need for a new approach to dealing with tech giants such as Google, Meta and others.",
      "\"Today, a handful of corporations can shape everything from the information we consume to the places we shop,\" Carr wrote in the document. \"These corporate behemoths are not merely exercising market power, they are abusing dominant positions.\"",
      "The FCC should restrict immunity from Section 230, part of a law that says tech companies aren't liable if a user posts something libelous, as well as tamp down the businesses' ability to \"censor protected speech while maintaining their Section 230 protections,\" he wrote.",
      "Carr also wants tech companies to be more transparent about their algorithm changes and their decisions to block or demonetize users.",
      "What are Carr's views on Elon Musk?",
      "Carr has built an alliance with billionaire Musk, the world's wealthiest person who backed Trump's campaign and whose Starlink satellite internet service could benefit from access to federal cash.",
      "In a Tuesday interview with Fox News, Carr pointed to Musk as an example of how the federal government doesn't treat people fairly, noting that a grant of almost $900 million to Musk's Starlink was \"revoked unlawfully.\" Last year, the FCC said it rejected the grant because of lack of proof that Starlink would be able to provide service to hundreds of thousands of rural properties.",
      "\"It is time for the American government to not give people different treatment based on their last name,\" Carr told Fox News. \"Everybody will get a fair shake from the government going forward.\"",
      "What about his views on TikTok and Chinese businesses?",
      "In his Project 2025 chapter, Carr singled out TikTok and other Chinese-owned businesses as potential threats to U.S. security.",
      "\"As law enforcement officials have made clear, TikTok poses a serious and unacceptable risk to America's national security,\" Carr wrote. \"It also provides Beijing with an opportunity to run a foreign influence campaign by determining the news and information that the app feeds to millions of Americans.\"",
      "That would align his views along those with the Biden administration, with the president\u00a0signing a law in April that would require TikTok to be sold or else banned from the U.S.",
      "Carr also wrote that he believes the FCC needs to do more to monitor and restrict Chinese telecom and tech businesses from operating within the U.S.",
      "What does Carr say about broadcasters?",
      "Carr has taken aim at some broadcasters, including CBS News, echoing Trump's claims that they engage in political bias. For instance, Carr singled out NBC for including Trump's Democratic rival, Kamala Harris, in a \"Saturday Night Live\" skit before the election.",
      "\"This is a clear and blatant effort to evade the FCC's Equal Time rule,\" Carr wrote on X on November 2. \"The purpose of the rule is to avoid exactly this type of biased and partisan conduct \u2014 a licensed broadcaster using the public airwaves to exert its influence for one candidate on the eve of an election.\"",
      "After Trump announced Carr's pick, Carr said on X that he will ensure the FCC \"will enforce\" laws that call on broadcasters \"to operate in the public interest.\"",
      "Trump has repeatedly called to strip major broadcasters such as ABC, NBC and CBS of their licenses. During the 2024 campaign, Trump\u00a0sued CBS News\u00a0over a \"60 Minutes\" interview with Harris, alleging the network used \"deceitful\" editing of her responses. CBS News has called the president-elect's claims \"completely without merit\" and added it intended to vigorously defend against the lawsuit.",
      "What do supporters and critics say about Carr?",
      "Trump praised Carr as \"a warrior for Free Speech\" in a statement announcing his selection. Fellow FCC Commissioner Geoffrey Starks, a Democrat, described Carr as \"a dedicated public servant and a recognized leader on the many issues before the Commission today.\"",
      "But some critics have flagged some of Carr's stances, with the nonpartisan public interest group Free Press describing his relationship with Musk as well as his stance on broadcasters as problematic.",
      "\"While styling himself as a free-speech champion, Carr refused to stand up when Trump threatened to take away the broadcast licenses of TV stations for daring to fact check him during the campaign,\" Free Press Action Co-CEO Craig Aaron said in a statement. \"This alone should be disqualifying.\"",
      "Free Press and Fight for the Future, an advocacy group focused on digital rights, both have cited concerns about net neutrality, a policy that ensures internet service providers treat all websites and online content equally. Net neutrality was overturned during the first Trump administration, but was restored during Biden's term.",
      "\"Trump's nomination of Brendan Carr, one of the co-authors of Project 2025, to head the FCC is more than just a reversal of popular policies like net neutrality,\" said Evan Greer, director of Fight for the Future, said in an email. \"Carr has made clear he actually wants the FCC to get more involved in policing online speech.\"",

    "summary": "The proposed breakup calls for Google to sell its industry-leading Chrome web browser and impose restrictions designed to prevent its Android smartphone software from favoring its search engine.",
    "story": [
      "U.S. regulators want a federal judge to break up Google to prevent the company from continuing to squash competition through its dominant search engine after a court found it had maintained an abusive monopoly over the past decade.",
      "The proposed breakup floated in a 23-page document filed late Wednesday by the U.S. Justice Department calls for Google to sell its industry-leading Chrome web browser and impose restrictions designed to prevent its Android smartphone software from favoring its search engine.",
      "The recommended penalties underscore how severely regulators operating under President Biden believe Google should be punished following an August ruling by U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta that branded Google as a monopolist. The Justice Department decision-makers who will inherit the case after President-elect Donald Trump takes office next year might not be as strident. The Washington, D.C. court hearings on Google's punishment are scheduled to begin in April and Mehta is aiming to issue his final decision before Labor Day.",
      "If Mehta embraces the Justice Department's recommendations, Google will almost certainly appeal the punishments, prolonging a legal tussle that has dragged on for more than four years.",
      "Besides seeking a Chrome spinoff and corralling of the Android software, the Justice Department wants the judge to ban Google from forging multibillion-dollar deals to lock in its dominant search engine as the default option on Apple's iPhone and other devices.",
      "Regulators also want Google to share data it collects from people's queries with its rivals, giving them a better chance at competing with the tech giant.",
      "The measures, if they are ordered, threaten to upend a business expected to generate more than $300 billion in revenue this year \u2014 a moneymaking machine that has given Google's parent company, Alphabet Inc.",
      "\"The playing field is not level because of Google's conduct, and Google's quality reflects the ill-gotten gains of an advantage illegally acquired,\" the Justice Department asserted in its recommendations. \"The remedy must close this gap and deprive Google of these advantages.\"",
      "It's still possible that the Justice Department could ease off attempts to break up Google, especially if Trump takes the widely expected step of replacing Jonathan Kanter, who was appointed by Biden to oversee the agency's antitrust division.",
      "Although the case targeting Google was originally filed during the final months of Trump's first term in office, Kanter oversaw the high-profile trial that culminated in Mehta's ruling against Google. Working in tandem with Federal Trade Commission Chair Lina Khan, Kanter took a get-tough stance against Big Tech that triggered other attempted crackdowns on industry powerhouses such as Apple and discouraged business deals from getting done during the past four years.",
      "Trump recently expressed concerns that a breakup might destroy Google but didn't elaborate on the alternative penalties he might have in mind. \"What you can do without breaking it up is make sure it's more fair,\" Trump said last month. Matt Gaetz, the former Republican congressman that Trump nominated to be the next U.S. Attorney General, has previously called for the breakup of Big Tech companies.",
      "Gaetz, a firebrand for Trump, faces a tough confirmation hearing.",
      "This latest filing gave Kanter and his team a final chance to spell out measures that they believe are needed to restore competition in search. It comes six weeks after Justice first floated the idea of a breakup in a preliminary outline of potential penalties.",
      "But Kanter's proposal is already raising questions about whether regulators seek to impose controls that extend beyond the issues covered in last year's trial, and \u2014 by extension \u2014 Mehta's ruling.",
      "Banning the default search deals that Google now pays more than $26 billion annually to maintain was one of the main practices that troubled Mehta in his ruling.",
      "It's less clear whether the judge will embrace the Justice Department's contention that Chrome needs to be spun out of Google and Android should be unbundled from the company's other services.",
      "Trying to break up Google harks back to a similar punishment initially imposed on Microsoft a quarter century ago following another major antitrust trial that culminated in a federal judge deciding the software maker had illegally used his Windows operating system for PCs to stifle competition.",
      "However, an appeals court overturned an order that would have broken up Microsoft, a precedent many experts believe will make Mehta reluctant to go down a similar road with the Google case.",

    "story": [
      "Bryan Kohberger, the man accused of killing four University of Idaho students in 2022, can face the death penalty, a judge has ruled.",
      "Kohberger's defense team had sought to remove the death penalty as a possible punishment should he be convicted, but Ada County Judge Steven Hippler denied their motions in his ruling dated Tuesday. The prosecution has said it intends to seek the death penalty if Kohberger is convicted.",
      "Kohberger's attorneys' arguments included claims that forcing inmates to wait for years on death row and the methods available for prisoners to be executed in Idaho both constitute cruel and unusual punishment. They also argued Idaho's death penalty laws violate an international treaty banning the torture of prisoners.",
      "Kohberger\u00a0is accused of the Nov. 13, 2022, stabbing deaths of Ethan Chapin, Xana Kernodle, Madison Mogen and Kaylee Goncalves. All four were students at the University of Idaho and were killed in a home off campus. Kohberger was arrested on Dec. 30, 2022, in Pennsylvania and was extradited back to Idaho in January 2023.

    "published": "Wed, 20 Nov 2024 20:31:57 -0500",
    "summary": "Trump signaled this week that he would enlist the help of the U.S. military for his massive deportation operation.",
    "story": [
      "President-elect Donald Trump has vowed to start the largest deportation effort in American history \u2014 his signature 2024 campaign promise \u2014 as soon as he takes office, signaling this week that he would enlist the help of the U.S. military for the massive operation to deport undocumented immigrants.",
      "Earlier this week, he shared a social media post indicating that he'd declare a national emergency and deploy military assets to carry out deportations.",
      "Still, how exactly the military would be tapped to carry out this promise of mass deportations is unclear. And there are untested legal questions about involving service members in immigration enforcement operations.",
      "The Department of Defense has provided operational support to immigration and border authorities for decades, under both Republican and Democratic presidents. Roughly 4,000 service members \u2013 primarily from the National Guard \u2014 are currently authorized to support the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) security mission along the southwest border, according to the U.S. Northern Command.",
      "While longstanding federal law generally prohibits the use of the military for domestic law enforcement \u2014 which includes immigration arrests and deportations \u2014 a few rarely invoked statutory exceptions exist.",
      "The Department of Defense's vast funding and resources could be instrumental in helping the incoming administration address the operational and financial challenges of carrying out deportations on a monumental scale. Immigration and Customs Enforcement's deportation branch has a fraction of the resources that would be necessary, with 6,000 agents and 41,000 detention beds. About 11 million immigrants are estimated to be living in the U.S. illegally.",
      "What have Trump and his allies said about using the military for deportations?",
      "In an interview with CBS' \"60 Minutes\" last month, Tom Homan, who Trump has appointed to be his \"border czar,\" indicated that one way to increase manpower for the mass deportation plan would be to re-hire retired ICE agents. Contractors, he added, could do some of the operational work, including handling transportation and setting up so-called \"soft-sided\" facilities, or tent detention sites, to hold migrant detainees.",
      "Homan said transportation and supply assets from the Department of Defense would also be helpful, suggesting that military planes could be used for deportation. But Stephen Miller, the incoming White House deputy chief of staff, has gone further than Homan, suggesting the National Guard could be deputized to arrest undocumented immigrants.",
      "\"We will deputize them as immigration enforcement officers,\" Miller said during a radio interview last year. \"They know their states, they know their communities, they know their cities.\"",
      "And while U.S. law generally bans the use of the armed forces for domestic law enforcement, during an interview with the New York Times last year, Miller said a revamped Trump administration would invoke what's known as the Insurrection Act to create an exception, enabling the use of federal troops to apprehend migrants.",
      "The military, Miller has also indicated, could be dispatched to the southern border with \"an impedance and denial mission.\"",
      "\"You reassert the fundamental constitutional principle that you don't have the right to enter into our sovereign territory, to even request an asylum claim,\" Miller said at this year's CPAC. \"The military has the right to establish a fortress position on the border to say no one can cross here at all.\"",
      "Finally, Trump has pledged to use the Alien and Sedition Acts of 1798 \u2014 a law invoked during World War II to approve the surveillance and detention of Italian, German, Japanese immigrants \u2014 to deport suspected migrant gang members.",
      "How could the military be deployed to the U.S. border?",
      "The U.S. military's role at the U.S.-Mexico border dates back to the Mexican American War, with additional buildup of troops at the southern border during the Mexican Revolution and World War I.",
      "\"For basically the past 40 years, the military's involvement at the border has been steadily growing,\" said Joseph Nunn, counsel at the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University's School of Law, \"And it has gone from sort of ad hoc to routine to deeply entrenched into how we approach border security and immigration.\"",
      "Members of the military stationed at the border have historically performed an array of support tasks, experts tell CBS News \u2013 from operating surveillance aircrafts and transporting U.S. Border Patrol personnel in helicopters to laying concertina wire and maintaining Customs and Border Protection vehicles.",
      "Homan's suggestions of using the military for some of the operational work that doesn't involve engaging with migrants would fall under this category and would be an expansion of the duties National Guard and a small number of active-duty troops have performed at the southern border under previous administrations. As recently as last year, troops were deployed to the border to help Border Patrol with administrative tasks, like warehouse management and clerical work.",
      "Military involvement now \"is just essentially to get access to more bodies and more aircrafts,\" Nunn explained, calling military mobilization a force multiplier. \"Suppose you want to set up a checkpoint on a highway in Texas or Arizona. Under normal circumstances, you need five CBP agents to run a checkpoint. If you have access to military personnel, you can run a checkpoint with one CBP agent assisted by four soldiers. Then suddenly five CBP agents assisted by soldiers can run five checkpoints instead of one.\"",
      "\"[The Trump administration] would also use the military to do things like build bases and facilities to hold people,\" senior fellow at the Atlantic Council, Thomas Warrick, told CBS News. \"He could use the military to fly detainees around the country or indeed to deport them to other countries if they can get landing rights.\"",
      "Can the U.S. military act as domestic law enforcement?",
      "Using the military in an active law enforcement role, rather than in a support capacity, would be more complex and unusual, but subject to at least one legal loophole.",
      "The Posse Comitatus Act bars federal armed forces from participating in law enforcement activities unless expressly authorized by Congress. But the 1807 Insurrection Act, which Miller mentioned, allows the president to utilize the military in domestic cases that warrant it. While the National Guard is under state control and not activated for federal service, it is not subject to Posse Comitatus.",
      "Abraham Lincoln used it during the Civil War, and in the 20th century, Dwight D. Eisenhower and John F. Kennedy relied on the law to desegregate schools, deploying troops to the South after the Supreme Court's landmark decision in Brown v. Board of Education. The most recent time it was used was in 1992 by President George H.W. Bush after both city and state leaders asked for federal help to quell the L.A. riots.",
      "According to the law, the military may be activated to enforce the laws on U.S. soil or to \"suppress rebellion\" whenever \"unlawful obstructions, combinations, or assemblages, or rebellion\" make it \"impracticable\" to enforce federal law in that state by the \"ordinary course of judicial proceedings.\"",
      "Can this be challenged in court?",
      "Lee Gelernt, a lawyer at the American Civil Liberties Union, said using the military to carry out deportations under the Alien and Sedition Acts would be \"patently unlawful,\" because current circumstances don't allow for it.",
      "\"The law requires an invasion by a foreign government,\" said Gelernt, who challenged many of the first Trump administration's immigration policies. \"That's not what is happening with immigration.\"",
      "There is already an agency, ICE, that enforces immigration laws with arrest authority that the U.S. military does not have.",
      "\"It was designed for unexpected emergencies,\" Nunn said, but added that, \"its text grants vast discretion to the president\" with \"no meaningful criteria\" to justify invoking it.",
      "In 1827, the Supreme Court ruled in Martin v. Mott that the president has the sole authority to decide whether a situation warrants deploying the military. However, \"If you can prove that the president has invoked the insurrection act in bad faith, which is going to be a high bar to clear but not impossible, you could potentially challenge the decision to invoke the Insurrection Act,\" Nunn explained, adding that the centuries-old law does not permit the military to violate constitutional rights or to violate otherwise applicable federal law.",
      "Peter Feaver, a professor of political science and public policy at Duke University who focuses on civil military relations, said using the military as law enforcement would be controversial and could degrade trust in the military, even if there is a legal case for it.",
      "\"This is not what the military trains for, but on top of all of that, it would be deeply politically polarizing because there'd be many many Americans who would view this as an inappropriate mission, a betrayal of our American values or something,,\" said Feaver, who has written a book called \"Thanks for Your Service: The Causes and Consequences of Public Confidence in the US Military.\"",
      "Congress has no role in invoking the Insurrection Act. In July, Connecticut Senator Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat, renewed his legislative push to overhaul the law. He first introduced a bill reforming the Insurrection Act in 2020, after Trump's threats to use troops to respond to civil rights protests across the U.S. following the police killing of George Floyd, but his efforts were stalled by Republican opposition and pushback from the Trump administration.",
      "What if Trump declared a national emergency at the border?",
      "Trump declared a national emergency at the border during his first administration, after Congress declined to fund border wall construction. He used the declaration to unilaterally divert Pentagon funds to expand the border wall.",
      "\"The Pentagon budget \u2013 that's where the money is,\" Warrick said. \"It's where the people are. It's where the aircrafts are.\"",
      "The long-term cost of deporting 1 million people per year could average $88 billion annually, according to the American Immigration Council, surpassing the Department of Homeland Security's $62 billion budget in fiscal year 2025 and totalling nearly $968 billion over a decade. The operation would also demand lightning-speed expansion of the immigration court systems and detention facilities.",
      "\"It's going to be astronomically expensive,\" Nunn said. \"And not only is it going to be straightforwardly expensive, but it's also going to come with opportunity costs \u2014 every military service member and military asset that is diverted to assist with a mass deportation program or to assist with border security is a service member or asset that is not carrying out their normal duties.\"",

      "\"Our ultimate goal is for industry to do their part to ensure that the foods they introduce into the market are not adulterated or misbranded. Recalls help get the food off the market quickly when something goes wrong. Outbreak advisories provide important food safety information to the public,\" an FDA spokesperson said in a statement.",
      "The spokesperson also pointed to The Economist's report measuring global food security. The U.S. food supply is \"one of the safest in the world\" and ranked \"joint first for the food safety indicator in 2022,\" the spokesperson said.",
      "In fact, the FDA suggested, the number of recalls is an indicator that the safety system is working.",
      "\"The occurrence of recalls and outbreaks means that manufacturers, importers and distributors are monitoring for issues and taking action when they detect a problem,\" the FDA spokesperson said.",
      "An increase in illnesses in CDC data \u2014 but also an increase in testing",
      "Figures from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suggest the number of high-profile recalls have increased from last year, though not by much.",
      "So far this year, 10 \"multistate foodborne outbreak notices\" have been issued by the CDC. Last year there were nine notices. There were 24 notices issued in 2018, the most of any year over the past decade.",
      "Infections from foodborne outbreak culprits like Shiga toxin-producing E. coli, or STEC, have climbed to at least 13,962 this year, CDC records tally.",
      "Around 13,140 had been reported by health departments around this time last year and 12,119 were reported by this time in 2019.",
      "Foodborne illnesses linked to other germs have also climbed across the country in recent years, reports by the CDC's FoodNet system suggest, though improvements in how patients are tested for these germs may help explain some of the increase.",
      "\"Laboratory technology changes and that impacts what we see in the surveillance data. When laboratory testing gets faster, it gets more specific, it gets better in other ways. It makes the data a little bit less comparable,\" Sharon Shea, senior director of food safety at the Association for Public Health Laboratories, told CBS News.",
      "Shea, who has also worked as a microbiologist in hospital laboratories as well as public health labs, said other ways that public health departments and doctors respond to foodborne outbreaks have gotten better as well.",
      "Some of that is a time-saving shift towards \"molecular-based\" panel tests that can be run by hospitals and clinical labs for an array of germs, instead of one-off tests for specific pathogens, that were rolled out after 2012.",
      "Labs in the PulseNet network helmed by the CDC have also switched to \"whole genome sequencing,\" Shea said \u2014 a more accurate approach to narrowing down the unique genetic fingerprint that can link different cases together for investigators. Those connections can be crucial for uncovering common foods eaten by sick people in an outbreak.",
      "\"The most preventable, needless deaths\"",
      "Food safety advocates outside the government say the U.S. still has plenty of room for improvement in food safety.",
      "\"It doesn't help to say 'Americans have the safest food in the world' when people are dying from baby carrots,\" said Sarah Sorscher, head of regulatory affairs at the Center for Science in the Public Interest.",
      "Sorscher acknowledged that public health departments have gotten better at investigating outbreaks, but cautioned that still only a fraction of foodborne illnesses are solved.",
      "\"Our public health system is getting better at solving outbreaks thanks to advances in whole genome sequencing and artificial intelligence, so it may be that we are just seeing more of the iceberg now than we did a few years ago,\" she said.",
      "Staffing shortages and breakdowns in food safety had also led to an artificial dip in the number of recalls and reported illnesses during the COVID-19 pandemic, Sorscher said.",
      "\"Our food supply is not as safe as it was even five years ago. Anyone who's gone to the grocery store or rifled through their refrigerator to see which onions and carrots in the produce drawer are the subject of the latest recall knows that,\" said Scott Faber, senior vice president for government relations at the nonprofit Environmental Working Group.",
      "Faber pointed to a previous report tracking a rebound in food recalls after 2020, based on data from the FDA as well as the U.S. Department of Agriculture.",
      "Inspections by the FDA of food facilities are falling short of a congressional mandate, the Environmental Working Group has argued. They have also criticized the agency for not requiring testing of irrigation water sprayed on crops, which can pose a contamination risk from nearby animal feeding operations.",
      "\"Not unlike washing your hands or not cutting your vegetables on the same cutting board as your chicken, they're just common sense measures to reduce the risk of foodborne illness. And these are the most preventable, needless deaths imaginable,\" said Faber.",

    "summary": "Former Rep. Matt Gaetz is meeting with Senate Republicans as he seeks to shore up support after Donald Trump tapped the embattled GOP firebrand as his pick for attorney general.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Former Republican Rep. Matt Gaetz met with senators on Capitol Hill on Wednesday as he seeks to shore up support for his nomination for attorney general amid calls for the House Ethics Committee to release a report on allegations he engaged in sexual misconduct and illicit drug use.",
      "Accompanied by Vice President-elect JD Vance, a senator from Ohio, Gaetz sat down with Republican senators, whose votes will be crucial in confirming him to the position of the nation's top law enforcement officer next year. The GOP is set to take control of the Senate in the next Congress and hold 53 seats, but Gaetz will need backing from a majority of the chamber to win confirmation.",
      "President-elect Donald Trump announced Gaetz as his pick for attorney general last week, after which the Florida Republican resigned his seat from Congress. But the selection and Gaetz's resignation came two days before the House Ethics Committee was poised to meet and vote on whether to make public its report detailing the findings of its long-running investigation into allegations Gaetz engaged in sexual misconduct and illicit drug use.",
      "The Republican has denied wrongdoing and called the Ethics probe a \"smear.\" He has blamed the investigation on former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, whom\u00a0Gaetz helped oust last year. Alex Pfeiffer, a spokesman for Trump's transition, said in a statement Monday that \"Matt Gaetz will be the next Attorney General. He's the right man for the job and will end the weaponization of our justice system. These are baseless allegations intended to derail the second Trump administration.\"",
      "Trump told reporters Tuesday that he is not reconsidering his selection for attorney general.",
      "Incoming Senate Majority Leader John Thune met with Gaetz on Wednesday, a spokesperson for Thune confirmed to CBS News.",
      "The spokesperson said the two met \"to discuss the Senate confirmation process, and he reiterated that Mr. Gaetz deserves a fair and transparent process, something that all of President Trump's nominees deserve.\"",
      "The news of the meeting was first reported by Punchbowl.",
      "Gaetz and Vance also met with Sens. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, Mike Lee of Utah, Josh Hawley of Missouri, Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee, John Kennedy of Louisiana, and John Cornyn and Ted Cruz of Texas. The seven sit on the Judiciary Committee, which will conduct Gaetz's confirmation hearings early next year. Sen. Joni Ernst of Iowa also met with Gaetz and Vance on Wednesday.",
      "Hawley told CBS News that the purpose of the meeting was to discuss the need to get a confirmation hearing and ensure that Gaetz gets an opportunity \"to respond in public, under oath.\" Hawley outlined that he thinks Gaetz has talked to every member of the Judiciary Committee and many other senators who do not sit on the committee. He said he expects Gaetz to meet with all 53 incoming Republicans over the coming weeks.",
      "\"President Trump is very committed to moving this forward. And I know there's been some speculation among my colleagues that maybe this wouldn't actually go to a confirmation hearing, but they want one, and I think they're absolutely entitled to have that,\" he said. \"Gaetz wants the opportunity to testify, to respond to critics, answer questions, talk about his vision for the department.\"",
      "Hawley is likely to vote for all of Trump's nominees, he said, and believes there will be \"no shortage of information\" about Gaetz available for senators.",
      "At least one Republican senator, Susan Collins of Maine, said she has not been asked to meet with Gaetz yet. Collins is among the most moderate members of the conference, and her vote could be critical to Gaetz's confirmation. She previously said she was \"shocked\" by his selection.",
      "After his meeting with Gaetz, Graham said that while he tends to defer to presidential Cabinet choices \"unless the evidence suggests disqualification,\" the process for Trump's selections \"will not be a rubber stamp, nor will it be driven by a lynch mob.\"",
      "\"I fear the process surrounding the Gaetz nomination is turning into an angry mob, and unverified allegations are being treated as if they are true. I have seen this movie before,\" he said, an apparent reference to Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation process in 2018. \"I would urge all of my Senate colleagues, particularly Republicans, not to join the lynch mob and give the process a chance to move forward.\"",
      "Lee, speaking with reporters following his meeting with Gaetz, said Kavanaugh's Senate confirmation hearings should be a \"warning\" amid the allegations against the Florida Republican.",
      "\"There were a lot of allegations thrown at Brett Kavanaugh that turned out to be uncorroborated in many, many instances,\" Lee said. \"And so I do think that is something of a voice of warning people ought to take. Just because allegations are made, and just because people talk a lot about them \u2014 and sometimes in a fit of politically driven eagerness to embrace them, assume their\u00a0 truth \u2014 doesn't mean that they are, in fact, true.\"",
      "Kavanaugh was accused of engaging in sexual misconduct decades earlier and vehemently denied the accusations. The Judiciary Committee held a set of extraordinary hearings that included testimony from Kavanaugh and Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, who claimed he assaulted her during a party when they were in high school in the 1980s. Classmates who were at the party, however, could not corroborate Ford's allegations. Kavanaugh was confirmed by the Senate in a 50-48 vote, the narrowest margin in more than a century.",
      "Gaetz has been under investigation for several years by the House Ethics Committee and Justice Department, which looked into allegations of sex trafficking and obstruction. Prosecutors declined to charge Gaetz last year.",
      "Ten of the 11 Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee asked FBI Director Chris Wray to turn over the full evidentiary file in the now-closed federal sex trafficking probe involving Gaetz.",
      "\"The Senate has a constitutional duty to provide advice and consent on presidential nominees, and it is crucial that we review all the information necessary to fulfill this duty as we consider Mr. Gaetz's nomination,\" the Democratic senators wrote in a letter to Wray. \"The grave public allegations against Mr. Gaetz speak directly to his fitness to serve as the chief law enforcement officer for the federal government.\"",
      "The Ethics Committee said in June that it had spoken with more than a dozen witnesses, issued 25 subpoenas and reviewed thousands of pages of documents as part of its investigation. It said in a rare statement that \"certain allegations\" merited continued review, among those the claims of sexual misconduct and drug use, accepting improper gifts, giving \"special privileges and favors\" and obstructing government investigations into his conduct.",
      "Multiple sources told CBS News at the time that four women testified to the Ethics panel that they had been paid to go to parties, which Gaetz attended, that included sex and drugs. A lawyer for two women who spoke with the panel told CBS News on Monday that they testified that Gaetz paid them directly and repeatedly for sex, and said Venmo transactions for the encounters were obtained by the panel.",
      "The attorney, Joel Leppard, also said the women told House investigators that Gaetz asked about \"party favors\" and \"vitamins\" at upcoming parties via text messages, which was understood to be code for drugs. One of Leppard's clients testified before the Ethics Committee that she witnessed Gaetz having sex with a 17-year-old against a game table during a July 2017 party, months after he was sworn in as a House member.",

      "\"We're looking for the ripe cones on the top of the tree,\" said Brian Kittler, chief program officer for the Resilient Forests program at the nonprofit conservation group American Forests.",
      "Using lift operators and climbers, Kittler and his team showed CBS News how his team hunts for pine cones.",
      "\"The more that we lose forest, we're losing our clean air and clean water, our ability to remove carbon from the atmosphere and address climate change,\" Kittler said.",
      "The threat comes from the West's unprecedented breed of megafires which, fueled by climate change, have destroyed more than 33 million acres since 2020, according to the National Interagency Fire Center. That's around the size of the state of Arkansas.",
      "If nothing is done to restore a forest after a wildfire, a vicious cycle begins. Fewer surviving trees means fewer pine cones for humans to pick and plant. That's what happened in the Fremont-Winema National Forest during the Barry Point Fire in 2012, Kittler said.",
      "\"There's basically no live trees, and there's no natural regeneration happening,\" Kittler said.",
      "Once the pine cones are collected, they're brought to a network of nurseries, where the seeds are extracted and grown into seedlings. One million seedlings will plant about 4,500 acres of new forest.",
      "But the program alone is not enough to restore the forest, said Brian Reatini, a geneticist with the U.S. Forest Service. He says they're short about 200,000 acres \u2014 and that's just in one part of Oregon.",
      "The warming environment also means fewer seedlings will likely grow to maturity, which takes about 20 years.",
      "\"It's become much more arid, hotter and dryer. One of the consequences of that, it can push trees towards the edge of what they can physiologically tolerate,\" Reatini said.",
      "To help combat that problem, they're sourcing seeds from more \"drought tolerant\" tree species.",

So if we're able to replant our little block of land, but we're surrounded by untreated, burned forest land, eventually that's just gonna become a brush field and it will burn again and threaten our land again,\" said Galen Smith, the company's vice president of resources.",

    "story": [
      "A judge has convicted the man on trial for the killing of Laken Riley, a nursing student in Georgia whose death in February shook the college town where she studied, as well as the country.",
      "Jose Ibarra, 26, was found guilty Wednesday morning of murder and other charges related to Riley's death. He was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole.",
      "Ibarra, an undocumented Venezuelan immigrant, entered the United States illegally in 2022, officials said, but he was allowed to remain in the country to pursue his immigration case. His status helped bring\u00a0the national debate over border laws\u00a0to a boiling point earlier this year, as prominent Republicans, including President-elect Donald Trump, blamed President Biden's policies for Riley's death.",
      "The verdict handed down by Athens-Clarke County Superior Court Judge H. Patrick Haggard marked the end of four days of emotional hearings that began last week. Ibarra waived his right to a jury trial after pleading not guilty to a 10-count indictment brought against him in the wake of Riley's killing, which meant the case would be heard and decided solely by the judge. He also declined to testify during the trial.",
      "The state had charged Ibarra with one count of malice murder, three counts of felony murder and one count each of kidnapping, aggravated assault, aggravated battery, hindering an emergency telephone call, tampering with evidence, and being a \"peeping Tom.\" That final charge stemmed from prosecutors' allegation that Ibarra peered into the window of an apartment in a university residential building on the day Riley was murdered. Prosecutors said he was \"hunting for females on the University of Georgia's campus\" when he encountered Riley.",
      "Ibarra was found guilty on all 10 counts. Audible wails were heard in the courtroom when Haggard announced the verdict, citing a portion of the prosecution's closing argument that emphasized the evidence against Ibarra was \"overwhelming and powerful.\" The defendant, receiving the news in Spanish through a translator, maintained the stoicism he displayed in court throughout the trial.",
      "Haggard heard impact statements from Riley's loved ones after reading the verdict. Her parents, sister, roommates and friends spoke through tears while they described Riley as a cheerful, ambitious and generous young person who valued her faith and prioritized helping others. Many called Ibarra a monster and the crime an act of evil, and Riley's classmates said separately they now fear for their safety at school. The prosecution also shared excruciating video of the moment police told Riley's family she was dead.",
      "Everyone who gave statements pressed the judge to impose the maximum sentence. Prosecutors did not seek the death penalty in this case.",
      "\"There is no end to the pain, suffering and loss that we have experienced or will continue to endure,\" said Riley's mother, Allyson Phillips, in her remarks. \"This sick, twisted and evil coward showed no regard for Laken or human life. We are asking the same be done to him.\"",
      "Riley was found dead on Feb. 22 in a wooded part of the University of Georgia campus in Athens, where she was enrolled in the Augusta University College of Nursing. The 22-year-old had gone for a run that morning through the school's intramural fields, which was routine for her, and a concerned friend called University of Georgia police at around noon once Riley failed to return. She often talked to her mother on the phone while out running in the mornings, so when Riley's friends and family did not hear from her, they worried something was wrong.",
      "Phillips\u00a0called and texted her daughter several times after missing an initial call from Riley just after 9 a.m., according to logs and messages pulled from the student's phone and shown in court Tuesday, as the state's case wound down. Phillips and other family members continued to reach out to Riley for several hours when she did not reply.",
      "Phillips cried at the Tuesday hearing as her text messages were read aloud on the stand by Georgia Police Sgt. Sophie Raboud, one of the lead investigators in Riley's case. In one of her final messages to Riley at 11:47 a.m., her mother wrote, \"You're making me nervous not answering while you're out running. Are you OK?\"",
      "Riley's mother, along with family and friends in attendance, became emotional at a different point in Raboud's testimony where she answered questions about the video being played of Riley running the morning of her death.",
      "Ibarra was arrested the following day and booked without bond in the Athens-Clarke County Jail. Police have said Riley's killing appeared to be a random attack. But the indictment returned by a Georgia grand jury in May detailed a gruesome confrontation in which Ibarra allegedly asphyxiated the student, hit her over the head with a rock to the point of disfiguring her skull, and pulled up her clothing, intending to rape her.",
      "In court, attorneys for the state also described a disturbing scene. Prosecutor Sheila Ross said Friday that Ibarra killed Riley violently after a prolonged struggle.",
      "\"When Laken Riley refused to be his rape victim, he bashed her skull in with a rock repeatedly,\" Ross told the judge. She said evidence \u2014 including surveillance footage, traces of Ibarra's DNA under Riley's fingernails, and his thumbprint left behind on her phone screen \u2014 would show the student \"fought for her life, for her dignity\" over almost 20 minutes.",
      "Data from Riley's watch indicated she stopped suddenly in the middle of her run at around 9:10 a.m. the day she died and called 911 about a minute later. The watch showed Riley's heart was still beating until 9:28 a.m., Ross said.",
      "Ibarra's defense attorney, Dustin Kirby, had argued the prosecution's evidence against his client was circumstantial and did not prove his guilt. Ibarra has appeared in court with shackles around his ankles and headphones to follow a translation of the trial proceedings in Spanish.",
      "\"The evidence in this case is very good that Laken Riley was murdered,\" Kirby said. Still, the defense has tried to challenge the strength of the prosecution's evidence, saying even the DNA sample may not completely rule out other suspects. Ibarra's legal team raised questions, for example, about whether one of his brothers could have committed the crime. The defendant's brother Diego Ibarra worked a shift at the University of Georgia's dining hall on the day of the murder.",
      "Witness testimony for the prosecution continued into Monday, when an FBI Special Agent James Burnie told the court that electronic location data seemed to place Riley and Ibarra in the same wooded area at the time of her death. GPS coordinates from Riley's cellphone and smartwatch confirmed her precise location in the area where officers found her body, and pings between Ibarra's phone and cell towers suggested he was likely in the woods, too, Burnie said.",
      "Prosecutors during that hearing also played a recording for the court of a May phone call between Ibarra's wife, Layling Franco, and Ibarra while he was in jail. On the call, Ibarra told Franco he had been looking for work at the University of Georgia, and his wife urged him multiple times to tell her the truth about what happened to Riley, FBI specialist Abeisis Ramirez said during his testimony. The recording of their conversation was translated from Spanish for the court.",
      "The jail call was not admitted into evidence in Ibarra's trial and could not be considered in the case, Judge Haggard announced Tuesday morning.",
      "\"After hearing the translations I do find that it was more than contextual, and therefore violates the confrontation clause of the 6th Amendment,\" the judge said. The clause protects the rights of an individual accused of a crime to confront witnesses.",

      "Most dolphin strandings on earth",
      "\"We typically get about 68 live dolphins per year, currently, as I'm sitting here today, we have had 342,\" said Brian Sharp with the International Fund for Animal Welfare.",
      "Sharp said the southeast corner of the Cape Cod bay has more dolphin strandings than anywhere on the planet.",
      "IFAW and their volunteers work to rescue these animals, and sometimes that means driving them around in a mobile dolphin unit. It's a large shipping truck with padding on the inside. Typically, they release the dolphins off the coast of Provincetown because it has easy access to deeper water, and the IFAW team can get their equipment to the shore.",
      "The Wellfleet Fire Department was called to help during one incident. Luke Fancy and his crew used their equipment to trickle water over the animals.",
      "\"We had to cover our hands over the blowhole because I guess if you get a lot of water in the blowhole you can actually drown the dolphin,\" said Fancy.",

      "Stranding involves food",
      "\"And in that flooded water you could see a ton of bait fish,\" added Fancy.",
      "Sharp believes the stranding spike has to do with food. Fisherman tell them, prey fish for dolphins and whales are showing up closer to shore and in much greater numbers.",

    "summary": "Gautam Adani, one of the world's richest people, is accused of concealing that a solar energy project was being facilitated by an alleged $265 million bribery scheme.",
    "story": [
      "An Indian businessman who is one of the world's richest people has been indicted in the U.S. on charges he duped investors by concealing that his company's huge solar energy project on the subcontinent was being facilitated by an alleged $265 million bribery scheme.",
      "Gautam Adani, 62, was charged in an indictment unsealed Wednesday with securities fraud and conspiracy to commit securities and wire fraud. The case involves a lucrative arrangement for Adani Green Energy Ltd. and another firm to sell 12 gigawatts of solar power to the Indian government \u2014 enough to light millions of homes and businesses.",
      "The indictment portrays Adani and his co-defendants of playing two sides of the deal.",
      "It accuses them of portraying it as rosy and above-board to Wall Street investors who poured several billion dollars into the project while, back in India, they were paying or planning to pay about $265 million in bribes to government officials in exchange for billions of dollars' worth of contracts and financing.",
      "Adani and his co-defendants allegedly sought to \"obtain and finance massive state energy supply contracts through corruption and fraud at the expense of U.S. investors,\" Deputy Assistant Attorney General Lisa Miller said.",
      "In a parallel civil action, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission accused Adani and two co-defendants of violating antifraud provisions of U.S. securities laws. The regulator is seeking monetary penalties and other sanctions.",
      "Both cases were filed in federal court in Brooklyn. Adani's co-defendants include his nephew Sagar Adani, the executive director of Adani Green Energy's board, and Vneet Jaain, who was the company's chief executive from 2020 to 2023 and remains managing director of its board.",
      "Online court records did not list a lawyer who could speak on Adani's behalf. An email message seeking comment was left with an arm of his conglomerate, the Adani Group. Emails were also sent to lawyers representing his co-defendants. Sagar Adani's lawyer, Sean Hecker, declined the comment. The others did not immediately respond.",
      "Sanjay Wadhwa, acting director of the SEC's Enforcement Division, said Gautam and Sagar Adani are accused of persuading investors to buy their company's bonds by misrepresenting \"not only that Adani Green had a robust anti-bribery compliance program but also that the company's senior management had not and would not pay or promise to pay bribes.\"",
      "According to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, Adani is the 19th richest person in the world with an estimated total net worth of about $85.5 billion. However, that is down significantly from 2022, when he briefly overtook Amazon founder Jeff Bezos as No. 2 on the list with a net worth of more than $146 billion.",
      "He is a power player in the world's most populous nation. He built his fortune in the coal business in the 1990s. The Adani Group grew to involve many aspects of Indian life, from making defense equipment to building roads to selling cooking oil.",
      "In recent years, Adani has made big moves into renewable energy, embracing a philosophy of sustainable growth reflected in its slogan: \"Growth with Goodness.\"",
      "Last year, a U.S.-based financial research firm accused Adani and his company of \"brazen stock manipulation\" and \"accounting fraud.\" The Adani Group called the claims \"a malicious combination of selective misinformation and stale, baseless and discredited allegations.\"",
      "The firm in question is known as a short-seller, a Wall Street term for traders that essentially bet on the prices of certain stocks to fall, and it had made such investments in relation to the Adani Group.",

    "summary": "The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has proposed new protections for giraffes, saying their populations are threatened by poaching, habitat loss and climate change.",
    "story": [
      "Giraffe populations are in trouble \u2014 and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service on Wednesday proposed listing three subspecies of the tall animals as endangered and two species as threatened under the Endangered Species Act.",
      "Their populations have been declining because of poaching, habitat loss and climate change, officials said. While giraffes are not native to the U.S., listing them under the act would still provide protections to giraffe populations.",
      "The Endangered Species Act, enacted in 1973, establishes protections for fish, wildlife and plants that are listed as threatened or endangered. Under the act, federal agencies are required to ensure their actions are unlikely to jeopardize listed species, according to the agency.",
      "\"Federal protections for giraffes will help protect a vulnerable species, foster biodiversity, support ecosystem health, combat wildlife trafficking, and promote sustainable economic practices,\" USFWS Director Martha Williams said in a press release. \"This action supports giraffe conservation while ensuring the United States does not contribute further to their decline.\"",
      "Specifically, officials said the listing would help giraffes by reducing the illegal hunting and trade of giraffes by requiring permits for import into the U.S. Trade is not the primary factor behind population decline, but it is playing a role, USFWS said. Their hair and tails have long been used in traditional medicine, the agency added, and in recent years giraffes have also been targeted by hunters for bushmeat.",
      "Listing them under the Endangered Species Act would also increase funding for species conservation in range countries and for research efforts to address conservation. It would also provide some limited financial support for developing and managing programs to conserve giraffes, the USFWS said.",
      "Giraffe subspecies from across Africa are at risk, according to the agency. The service proposed listing West African, Kordofan and Nubian giraffes as endangered. It also proposed listing Masai and reticulated giraffes as threatened.",
      "The West African, Kordofan and Nubian \u2014 all subspecies of the northern giraffe \u2014 have seen their population fall around 77% since 1985, according to federal officials. There are around 5,900 left, including only about 690 West African giraffes remain.",
      "The vast majority of reticulated giraffes live in Kenya, and their population is estimated at 15,985, according to USFWS. There are around 45,400 Masai giraffes \u2014 an amount roughly equivalent to 67% of their population in the 1970s.",
      "Giraffes feed on leaves, stems, flowers and fruits, so human population growth and habitat loss can hurt the species. Instances of drought have also led to increased human-wildlife conflicts.",

    "summary": "Conspiracies persist, although it is effectively impossible to steal a major election in the United States.",
    "story": [
      "We just had another election with a clear and verifiable victor, overseen by hundreds of thousands of election officials. Those public servants have suffered years of harassment, and despite their successes, are still being accused of taking part in a massive and impossible conspiracy \u2014 a conspiracy led by the party out of power to steal an election and cover up all evidence.",
      "Despite all evidence, many still believe that the opposition Democrats secretly overwhelmed the power of the Trump administration in 2020 to steal an election by 7 million popular votes and 70 electoral votes. And they believe that the Biden administration suddenly lost this mythical election-stealing power while controlling the executive branch in 2024.",
      "Within hours of President-elect Donald\u00a0Trump's projected victory in the 2024 election, conspiracy theories began to spread among those who opposed him. On the left, there were claims that \"the math just didn't add up,\" that 20 million ballots were \"missing\" or that Elon Musk's Starlink was uploading fake votes to help Trump. There was mischaracterization about why voters might split their votes between Trump and a Democrat.",
      "On the right, from those who supported Trump came claims that the \"20 million missing ballots\" were actually proof that the 2020 election had been stolen and that there was no possible way that President Biden could have received 81 million votes that year.",
      "For those who work in elections, and particularly the election officials around the country \u2014 public servants of both parties \u2014 these claims are familiar, and exhausting. And to be clear, these claims are false on their face.",
      "Millions of ballots weren't missing \u2013 they were being counted, and when the election is officially certified, we will confirm that the 2024 election saw only slightly lower turnout than 2020's all-time record. For those questioning \"missing votes,\" the 2024 election will end up seeing the second-largest number of ballots cast in any American election, and the second-highest turnout in any election in over 100 years, behind only 2020's record turnout.",
      "As for split votes, that happens all the time. Sometimes, as in 2020, there are a large number of voters who dislike both presidential candidates and choose to leave that race blank on their ballots. Sometimes, as in 2024, a significant number of people vote only for president, and leave the rest of their ballots blank. This is normal. Republicans in Arizona, Nevada, and Wisconsin didn't game the system to give Trump a win this year while allowing Democratic senators to win in each of those states. Democrats in 2020 didn't rig the system to defeat Trump that year, only to then give up key seats in state legislatures right before redistricting that would decide control of Congress. And we have the paper ballots that confirm this.",
      "And those paper ballots are the key. Trump won in 2024 in a verified, confirmed election with over 95% paper ballots, including all the ballots in all the swing states. Hand audits of those ballots are nearly complete and will confirm the results.",
      "Similarly, Mr. Biden won in 2020 in a verified, confirmed election with over 95% audited paper ballots, including all the ballots in all the swing states. The math adds up because the ballots add up, and the election officials have shown their work.",
      "We know who won the last two presidential elections, thanks to the paper ballots, audits, and more election litigation and court review than any election in world history. In dozens of court cases, losing candidates couldn't produce a single piece of evidence that raised any question about the 2020 election outcome.",
      "When Rudy Giuliani and Kari Lake were sued for defamation about their false claims, they could have defended themselves with evidence that they were speaking the truth. Instead, they conceded liability (Giuliani's assets have begun to be seized, and Lake just settled her case this past weekend). Fox News settled its defamation case with Dominion Voting Systems for nearly $800 million, rather than attempt to present evidence of the truth of its claims. A group of esteemed conservative legal scholars further confirmed the 2020 election was \"Lost, not Stolen.\"",
      "But whether coming from the right or the left, the conspiracies continue, and our nation's election officials are concerned about the lasting damage. Gabriel Sterling, chief operating officer of the Georgia Secretary of State's office told me, \"Ideas that Musk's Starlink or black box voting might change votes plant seeds that will germinate into deeper conspiracy theories, and then further undermine faith in elections and institutions.\"",

      "Our elections are incredibly decentralized, with nearly 10,000 different election jurisdictions nationwide, varying in technologies and processes. Our process is run by hundreds of thousands of election officials nationwide, of both parties. Every voter registration requires ID under federal law, and our voter records are as accurate as ever. In the exceedingly rare cases where fraud is attempted, it is caught and prosecuted. It is effectively impossible to steal a major election in the United States.",
      "But foreign adversaries and domestic grifters understand how to exploit concerns about the security of American elections. They have employed a more effective strategy, to convince us against all evidence that our elections are being stolen. They have become masters at leveraging the losing side's disappointment at the outcome to create a fantasy world of election denial and to stoke fear, anger and hate directed at our fellow citizens, including our public servants. We saw on Jan. 6, 2021,\u00a0how this anger can lead to violence.",
      "Entertaining these delusions could threaten our agency as voters. Worse, our susceptibility to these false claims aids U.S. adversaries, and puts public servants at risk. If we become a nation where both parties can only accept the integrity of our election system when they win, we are truly lost as a democracy.",

    "summary": "Some voters are hoping President-elect Donald Trump may send out another stimulus check. Here's what the experts say.",
    "story": [
      "President-elect Donald Trump in his first term as president sent out two stimulus checks to millions of Americans during the pandemic, part of the federal government's goal of keeping consumers financially afloat during the crisis. Now, some social media posts are claiming that Trump, once he takes office next year, may issue another check \u2014 a likelihood that experts say is extremely slim.",
      "Posts on TikTok are suggesting Trump might issue another round of checks, while on X, some users are questioning if they're in line for a payment.",
      "When the COVID-19 health emergency shuttered the economy in 2020, millions of Americans lost their jobs, sending the jobless rate to almost 15% and causing financial hardship for many. As a result, Trump signed two bills that sent stimulus checks to eligible households, while President Biden authorized a third.",
      "Even though many Americans feel the economy is faring badly, with some pointing to the impact of the pandemic's high inflation, the U.S. isn't anywhere close to the situation of the early 2020s, economists say.",
      "\"Stimulus checks typically only happen when the economy is in really bad shape and consumers need a push to start spending money again,\" LendingTree senior economist Jacob Channel told CBS MoneyWatch. \"That's not really the case in the present.\"",
      "Is the economy bad enough for a new stimulus check?",
      "While a majority of Americans give the economy poor ratings, economists say that it's in good shape overall, with solid GDP growth, inflation that is inching closer to the Federal Reserve's 2% annual goal and a jobless rate of 4.1% \u2014 which is near a 50-year low.",
      "\"Despite some pain points and general 'bad vibes' expressed by some people, the economy is currently in remarkably good shape and consumer spending is relatively strong,\" Channel said.",
      "Even so, many inflation-weary consumers say they haven't yet seen the benefit of that growth. The November 5 presidential election was viewed as a mandate from voters for a new economic direction.",
      "Could Trump issue a stimulus check?",
      "While some consumers might believe that Trump or Biden alone was responsible for sending out stimulus checks \u2014 perhaps because Trump put his name on the memo line of the first check \u2014 the payments were part of three bills passed by Congress, which were then sent to the sitting president for his signature.",
      "\"A president can't unilaterally issue stimulus checks, and the ones sent out during his last administration were largely the result of a push from Democrats in the House and Senate,\" Channel noted. \"Though Trump ultimately did sign the bill that sent stimulus checks to Americans, he isn't solely responsible for them.\"",
      "In other words, there would first need to be legislation passed by Congress to authorize another stimulus check, something that currently isn't on the horizon.",
      "Would a stimulus check impact inflation?",
      "With the Federal Reserve still aiming to pare inflation to a 2% annual rate \u2014 it stood at 2.6% last month \u2014 policymakers are likely to be cautious about any actions that could reignite inflation. Some economists have pointed to the surge in federal spending during the pandemic as\u00a0helping to create the conditions that led to the hottest inflation in 40 years.",
      "\"Because inflation is still such a big concern at the moment, the last thing a reasonable government would want to do is further stimulate consumer demand with stimulus checks because doing so would unnecessarily risk causing a resurgence in inflation,\" Channel noted.",
      "That being said, Trump's economic policies, including adding tariffs to imports and deporting millions of undocumented immigrants, could cause an inflation bump of as much of 1 percentage point, economists have said. That would push inflation to a range of about 3.6%, which Wall Street cautions could cause the Fed to hold off on further rate cuts.",
      "Could the IRS issue stimulus checks in 2024?",
      "The IRS sent the three rounds of pandemic stimulus checks after they were authorized by Congress and signed into law by Trump and Biden. In other words, without Congress' approval, the IRS won't be sending any stimulus checks in 2024.",
      "Currently there is no legislation in the works for stimulus spending, and such legislation is also considered extremely unlikely to occur in 2025. Instead, Trump and Republican lawmakers are likely to focus on tax legislation to extend the tax cuts in his 2017 Tax Cuts & Jobs Act, as well as tackling other spending issues, experts say.",

    "story": [
      "Thanksgiving dinner ingredients will cost more this year compared with last, even as food inflation cools. Fortunately, there's one simple way to save money without skimping on staple dishes for the food-driven holiday: store brands.",
      "Buying store-brand items versus national brand products is an age-old technique for saving money. And although there are instances of store-brand goods costing more than their name-brand counterparts, they can still save consumers money overall, new research from Wells Fargo\u00a0shows.",
      "How much can I save on store brands?",
      "\"Food inflation has slowed dramatically, but it's still not cheaper than a year ago, so that's a bone of contention from consumers,\" Wells Fargo chief agricultural economist Dr. Michael Swanson told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Still, grocery stores can undercut national brand prices by selling their own version of products from tissues to baked beans. Stores allege their products are equally good, but because they don't market them, they can sell them at a relative discount.",
      "\"The whole premise is that store brand represents a value to you. What store brand is supposed to bring is the same quality, same product, without all the marketing,\" Swanson said. \"Brands explain why you should eat theirs and not someone else's, whereas stores don't spend money and are supposed to pass the savings along to us, the consumers.\"",
      "This year, a store-brand Thanksgiving menu for 10 people, including turkey, stuffing, salad, cranberries, dinner rolls and pumpkin pie will cost consumers $73. That same menu made with name-brand products, will cost $90 this year, or $17 more, according to the Wells Fargo report.",
      "The $73 price tag is up 2.7% from last year.",
      "Keep your eye on all items \u2014 not just the turkey",
      "Grocers tend to run promotions on turkeys around Thanksgiving, given that they're such a seasonal purchase \u2014 the two-week window before the Thanksgiving holiday is when grocers make the bulk of their whole turkey sales.",
      "But buyers beware: Some retailers can lure you into the store with a deal on a turkey, only to sell you other items at high prices.",
      "\"Retailers will feature discounts on turkey to get you into store so that, while you're there, you'll pick up everything else,\" Swanson said. \"Make sure you don't just go in for the turkey and not pay attention to prices of other things on the shopping list, which can add up to a lot of money.\"",
      "Store-brand stuffing mixes are still priced high, but are an opportunity for savings nevertheless. Name-brand stuffing is up 9% compared with the same period last year, and store-brand stuffing is up 3%.",
      "Cranberries are an outlier this season. It's a category in which the name-brand product is priced lower than the store-brand alternative. A 12-ounce bag of name-brand fresh cranberries is down 3% compared with 2023, while the same-size bag of store-brand cranberries is up 6%.",

      "No one wants to file for bankruptcy, but if you're heading in that direction, delaying the inevitable may only make things worse.",
      "Bankruptcies are still significantly below pre-pandemic levels, but have gone up relative to last year. Personal bankruptcies were up\u00a016% in October from a year ago, as more Americans are seeking debt relief. But those struggling to stay financially afloat should consider the option sooner rather than later, advise experts who study when and why people file.",
      "\"When a consumer feels financial pressure, the last thing on their mind is seeking bankruptcy protection,\" said Michael Hunter, vice president, business development, at Epiq Aacer, a provider of bankruptcy information and partner to the American Bankruptcy Institute, or ABI. Most people don't file until 18 to 24 months after they've incurred financial hardship, Hunter said.",
      "Researchers, over decades of interviewing thousands of people who've declared personal bankruptcy, have found that about two-thirds of individual filers struggle with paying their debts for up to five years before seeking help.",
      "\"The common response is people are struggling with their debt for more than two years\" before seeking a legal remedy, Robert Lawless, a professor at the University of Illinois College of Law, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"People misunderstand bankruptcy and wait too long to see a bankruptcy lawyer. Most people would benefit by going earlier,\" said Lawless, a co-principal investigator in the Consumer Bankruptcy\u00a0Project, launched in 1981 by a group of academics including Senator Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., a law school professor at the time.",
      "When to file for bankruptcy",
      "Because of the stigma and shame that Americans attach to bankruptcy, people turn to it as a last resort \u2014 oftentimes after they have plowed through retirement funds and other assets that would be have been shielded from creditors by filing for debt relief.",
      "\"If you are raiding pension or other retirement assets, that is a red flag,\" said Lawless, noting those funds are protected from creditors in bankruptcy. Borrowing money to cover current expenses is another warning sign, he offered.",
      "\"It makes sense to file if a creditor is going to be able to take away something you need,\" said Pamela Foohey, a professor of law at the University of Georgia School of Law in Athens. \"If a person is dealing with a wage garnishment that is harming their lives, or if a lender is threatening to repossess your car. If there's no other way to get a car that will fit your budget, filing could be a way to keep your car, or keep your house.\"",
      "Otherwise the broad answer is to first address how they might solve the cause of their financial distress before filing for bankruptcy. \"It doesn't help to find a better-paying job if after bankruptcy more is going out than coming in,\" said Lawless.",
      "\"If you lost your job, file after you found a new job; if you have a health crisis, you file after you've gotten better to discharge all of the medical debt that you've racked up,\" said Foohey.",
      "If someone undergoes a change in their family situation, whether it's a divorce or the birth of twins, she advises that they first figure out how they're going to manage going forward on a budget\u00a0after the debt is discharged.",
      "\"Bankruptcy does one thing, it gets rid of debt. It doesn't find you a job, it doesn't put money in your pocket,\" said Lawless.",
      "Also, legally speaking, once debt is discharged or a financial repayment plan is approved by a judge, it will be another 5 to 8 years before one can file again.",
      "Chapter 7 versus Chapter 13",
      "It costs about $1,500 to file Chapter 7, and most attorneys require that their fees be paid upfront. Chapter 7 is a liquidation bankruptcy, where one's nonexempt property and assets \u2014 possessions not protected by bankruptcy \u2014 are turned over to a trustee, and debt is discharged in 3 to 6 months. According to Lawless, 95% of Chapter 7 don't have any assets to turn over.",
      "With a Chapter 13, payments can be spread out, however the overall cost is a lot more.",
      "Having to hire and pay an attorney several thousands dollars is also a daunting prospect for those in financial turmoil, but Lawless said a lawyer is a better option than filing for bankruptcy yourself or looking to consumer credit counseling \u2014 a service that is typically for-profit and has a long history of problems.",
      "\"In Chapter 13, attorneys can allow for nothing upfront, put all their fees in the repayment plan, and on average charge $4,500,\" Foohey said.",
      "According to Foohey, only about a third of those who file Chapter 13 make it to the end and have their debts discharged. \"Not everyone wants the discharge, but to reset their relationship with their mortgage holder,\" she said.",
      "A Chapter 13 involves committing to a 3- to 5-year repayment plan. However, many filers that enter the agreements don't complete them, Lawless relayed. \"Homeowners will file 13 so they don't lose their home. It's among the tools used to get caught up on mortgage payments,\" he said.",
      "Attorneys charge far less for Chapter 7, as it's a less-complicated process than a Chapter 13. The latter is used for, but a bad idea, to pay for one's bankruptcy.",
      "\"In 7, you have to pay for your bankruptcy upfront. In Chapter 13 you pay your attorney in that 3- to 5-year plan,\" said Lawless. \"If you're using 13 to pay your attorney feels that is generally the wrong choice.\"",
      "In Lawless' view, \"the number one thing Congress should do is make it possible to pay your Chapter 7 attorney over time, so we don't have people filing Chapter 13 when they don't need to.\"",
      "Return to pre-COVID numbers",
      "Personal bankruptcy filings averaged about 750,000 a year before COVID-19, but dropped off a cliff during the pandemic, thanks to government aid.",
      "\"It was very consistent from 2014 to 2019 \u2014 pretty flat, and then the pandemic hit. A lot of us thought volumes would surge,\" said Epiq's Hunter. But there was forbearance for student loans, cars and mortgages, he noted.",
      "\"Banks were extending olive branches, and we saw bankruptcies plummet to less than half of pre-pandemic levels,\" he said.",
      "\"There was a lot of money sloshing around,\" said Lawless, citing government stimulus programs and other aid. \"People paid down their debt,\" he stated.",
      "Now, with those financial lifelines largely unplugged, U.S. households are tacking more debt onto household balance sheets. \"The biggest surprise is bankruptcy filings haven't gone up even more,\" said Lawless, who expects a return to pre-COVID levels.",
      "Nonbusiness bankruptcy filings fell to under 400,000 before edging back up to 434,000 in 2023, according to statistics published by the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts. With two months left in 2024, personal bankruptcy filings stood at 405,132 at the end of October.",
      "\"We're still pretty far away from the filing numbers of 2019,\" said Foohey. \"There was a drastic drop at the time of the pandemic that continued for several years, which is now returning to pre-pandemic levels.\"",

      "Australian media also reported that two Danish tourists died after consuming tainted alcohol in Vang Vieng, but it was not immediately possible to confirm details.",

    "summary": "Ukraine has been one of the most mined countries in the world since Russia's invasion in 2022, and Ukraine is inundated with anti-personnel mines.",
    "story": [
      "The Biden administration will provide Ukraine with controversial anti-personnel mines in its war against Russia, a U.S. official confirmed to CBS News Tuesday night.",
      "Anti-personnel mines, or APLs, are designed to be used against people, not vehicles. They can be rapidly deployed and are meant to blunt the advances of ground forces, making them useful for Ukraine's defense against Russia's advances in Eastern Ukraine, the official said.",
      "The U.S. sought commitments from the Ukrainians on their use to further limit the risk to civilians, the official said, noting that Ukrainians are committed to not employing the mines in areas populated with their own civilians.",
      "The U.S.-provided APLs are different than the thousands of landmines being employed by Russia in eastern Ukraine in that they are \"non-persistent,\" meaning they become inert over a preset period of time, usually between four hours and two weeks, the official said. They are electrically fused and require battery power to detonate. Once the battery runs out, they will not detonate.",
      "Tuesday marked 1,000 days since Russia's invasion of Ukraine. CBS News learned Sunday that President Biden had lifted restrictions on Ukraine's use of U.S. weapons to conduct strikes deep inside Russia.",
      "U.S.-supplied ATACMS were used Tuesday on targets inside Russia, U.S. officials confirmed to CBS News.",
      "Ukraine has been one of the most mined countries in the world since Russia's invasion in 2022, and Ukraine is inundated with APLs. They are known by deceptively innocent names such as \"butterfly\" or \"petal\" mines because they scatter like flower petals when they drop from the sky.",
      "\"Typically, several hundred of these at a time will just be liberally and indiscriminately spread across the territory,\" Pete Smith, the Ukraine program manager for the HALO Trust, a nonprofit organization focused on ridding warzones of landmines, told \"60 Minutes\" in August. \"They can rest on the roofs. They can sit in guttering. They can take years before they come back into society and into view.\"",
      "To date, 164 nations, including Ukraine, have signed onto the Mine Ban Treaty which prohibits the use of APLs. However, three dozen countries have not agreed to it, including Russia and the U.S.",
      "In January 2020, then-President Donald Trump reversed an Obama-era policy which banned the use of APLs anywhere except on the Korean Peninsula. However, in June 2022, Mr. Biden reinstated the ban, except for APLs \"required for the defense of the Republic of Korea.\"",

    "story": [
      "Zhytomyr, Ukraine \u2014 Ukraine braced Wednesday for possible Russian retaliation after firing American-made and supplied missiles into Russia the previous day. The U.S. Embassy in Kyiv closed its doors on Wednesday and warned there were indications Russia was poised to launch a possible \"significant air attack\" on Ukraine.",
      "Exactly 1,000 days after Russia launched its full-scale invasion of its neighboring nation, Ukrainian forces fired eight U.S.-made ATACMS missiles into Russian territory on Tuesday, U.S. officials have confirmed to CBS News. It was the first time Ukrainian forces had taken advantage of President Biden's easing of restrictions over the weekend on Ukraine's use of the U.S.-supplied missiles to strike targets deeper inside Russia.",
      "Ukraine's military said it hit a Russian weapons depot in Bryansk early Tuesday, but it didn't say what weapons were used.",
      "In the immediate wake of the strike on Bryansk, the U.S. Embassy in Kyiv warned Americans in Ukraine to exercise extra caution in the weeks ahead and to stockpile food.",
      "On Wednesday, the embassy followed up with a formal security alert saying it had \"received specific information of a potential significant air attack\" by Russia, possibly within hours.",
      "\"Out of an abundance of caution, the Embassy will be closed, and Embassy employees are being instructed to shelter in place,\" the alert said, adding that U.S. nationals in the country should be \"prepared to immediately shelter in the event an air alert is announced.\"",
      "A Ukrainian military official told CBS News on Wednesday that the country had information suggesting the Russians could try to strike the center of Kyiv with ballistic missiles. Soon after, air raid sirens blared across Kyiv and other major cities, forcing thousands of people to seek shelter underground before the alert was lifted.",
      "In a statement carried by state media, Russia's Defense Ministry said Tuesday the military had shot down five ATACMS fired by Ukraine and damaged another. The reports said fragments had fallen at or near a military facility and that some of the debris had ignited a fire, but the ministry said there was no damage or casualties.",
      "According to manufacturer Lockheed Martin, the ATACMS are a \"long-range, guided missile that gives commanders the immediate firepower to shape the battlespace.\" Each of the weapons can carry a fragmentation warhead of up to 500 pounds, with a maximum range of 300 kilometers, or about 186 miles.",
      "The U.S. officials told CBS News that Russia may have shot down two of the ATACMS launched by Ukraine in the strike.",
      "The Ukrainian strike on Russia's western Bryansk region came hours after another Ukrainian residential neighborhood was left charred and smoking. Ukrainian officials said 10 people were killed Monday in a Russian drone and missile attack on the southern city of Odesa. That strike came a day after another strike on the power grid in Odesa, which also destroyed several homes.",
      "With Mr. Biden finally granting Ukraine the long-sought permission to fire ATACMS deeper into Russia, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's forces had a new option to retaliate for the latest carnage.",
      "Russia has accused the U.S. of adding fuel to the fire.",
      "In September, President Vladimir Putin warned that if the U.S. allowed Ukraine to use ATACMS inside his country, it would mean the U.S. and its NATO allies were at war with Russia.",
      "Putin has yet to respond directly to Mr. Biden's weekend decision, but lawmakers in Moscow fumed over the move on Monday, including a senator who called it \"a very big step toward the beginning of the third world war.\"",
      "Oleksandra Ustinova, a member of Ukraine's parliament who says she helped lobby the U.S. government to let Ukraine use the ATACMS deep inside Russia, told CBS News the strike on Bryansk helped demonstrate \"that these are legitimate targets, and that they're very important to protect our civilian population and our armed forces.\"",
      "Mr. Biden only agreed to Ukraine's long-sought permission to fire ATACMS into Russia on Sunday. He had been worried that such a decision could escalate the conflict.",
      "But the Kremlin has appeared less concerned about stoking fears of an escalation. Putin formally approved a change in Russia's nuclear doctrine Tuesday, lowering the threshold for a potential nuclear strike.",
      "Ustinova, the Ukrainian lawmaker, was dismissive of the move.",
      "\"He keeps playing and pretending like he's going to do something,\" she told CBS News. \"I've been saying since day one that he's a bully, and he's not going to do that.\"",
      "Russia and Ukraine have both kept their respective death tolls from the war secret, but Ukraine's military has undeniably paid a steep price for trying to defend the country from the invasion, with around 70,000 troops believed to have been killed. More than 100,000 soldiers from Russia \u2014 a country with a population more than three times larger than Ukraine's \u2014 have been killed, according to U.S. officials.",
      "Col. Maksym Balagura, a special forces commander in Ukraine's state border guard, acknowledged the vast size discrepancy when asked by CBS News if his country was short on manpower, saying it \"isn't possible to compare Russia and Ukraine. \u2026 Their country is 10 times the size of ours, and of course they have more manpower.\"",
      "But with the grueling ground and air war showing no signs of letting up, Russia's military has already been bolstered by more than 10,000 North Korean soldiers, according to Ukrainian, South Korean and U.S. officials.",

    "summary": "Gautam Adani, one of the world's richest people, is accused of concealing that a solar energy project was being facilitated by an alleged $265 million bribery scheme.",
    "story": [
      "An Indian businessman who is one of the world's richest people has been indicted in the U.S. on charges he duped investors by concealing that his company's huge solar energy project on the subcontinent was being facilitated by an alleged $265 million bribery scheme.",
      "Gautam Adani, 62, was charged in an indictment unsealed Wednesday with securities fraud and conspiracy to commit securities and wire fraud. The case involves a lucrative arrangement for Adani Green Energy Ltd. and another firm to sell 12 gigawatts of solar power to the Indian government \u2014 enough to light millions of homes and businesses.",
      "The indictment portrays Adani and his co-defendants of playing two sides of the deal.",
      "It accuses them of portraying it as rosy and above-board to Wall Street investors who poured several billion dollars into the project while, back in India, they were paying or planning to pay about $265 million in bribes to government officials in exchange for billions of dollars' worth of contracts and financing.",
      "Adani and his co-defendants allegedly sought to \"obtain and finance massive state energy supply contracts through corruption and fraud at the expense of U.S. investors,\" Deputy Assistant Attorney General Lisa Miller said.",
      "In a parallel civil action, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission accused Adani and two co-defendants of violating antifraud provisions of U.S. securities laws. The regulator is seeking monetary penalties and other sanctions.",
      "Both cases were filed in federal court in Brooklyn. Adani's co-defendants include his nephew Sagar Adani, the executive director of Adani Green Energy's board, and Vneet Jaain, who was the company's chief executive from 2020 to 2023 and remains managing director of its board.",
      "Online court records did not list a lawyer who could speak on Adani's behalf. An email message seeking comment was left with an arm of his conglomerate, the Adani Group. Emails were also sent to lawyers representing his co-defendants. Sagar Adani's lawyer, Sean Hecker, declined the comment. The others did not immediately respond.",
      "Sanjay Wadhwa, acting director of the SEC's Enforcement Division, said Gautam and Sagar Adani are accused of persuading investors to buy their company's bonds by misrepresenting \"not only that Adani Green had a robust anti-bribery compliance program but also that the company's senior management had not and would not pay or promise to pay bribes.\"",
      "According to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, Adani is the 19th richest person in the world with an estimated total net worth of about $85.5 billion. However, that is down significantly from 2022, when he briefly overtook Amazon founder Jeff Bezos as No. 2 on the list with a net worth of more than $146 billion.",
      "He is a power player in the world's most populous nation. He built his fortune in the coal business in the 1990s. The Adani Group grew to involve many aspects of Indian life, from making defense equipment to building roads to selling cooking oil.",
      "In recent years, Adani has made big moves into renewable energy, embracing a philosophy of sustainable growth reflected in its slogan: \"Growth with Goodness.\"",
      "Last year, a U.S.-based financial research firm accused Adani and his company of \"brazen stock manipulation\" and \"accounting fraud.\" The Adani Group called the claims \"a malicious combination of selective misinformation and stale, baseless and discredited allegations.\"",
      "The firm in question is known as a short-seller, a Wall Street term for traders that essentially bet on the prices of certain stocks to fall, and it had made such investments in relation to the Adani Group.",

    "summary": "The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has proposed new protections for giraffes, saying their populations are threatened by poaching, habitat loss and climate change.",
    "story": [
      "Giraffe populations are in trouble \u2014 and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service on Wednesday proposed listing three subspecies of the tall animals as endangered and two species as threatened under the Endangered Species Act.",
      "Their populations have been declining because of poaching, habitat loss and climate change, officials said. While giraffes are not native to the U.S., listing them under the act would still provide protections to giraffe populations.",
      "The Endangered Species Act, enacted in 1973, establishes protections for fish, wildlife and plants that are listed as threatened or endangered. Under the act, federal agencies are required to ensure their actions are unlikely to jeopardize listed species, according to the agency.",
      "\"Federal protections for giraffes will help protect a vulnerable species, foster biodiversity, support ecosystem health, combat wildlife trafficking, and promote sustainable economic practices,\" USFWS Director Martha Williams said in a press release. \"This action supports giraffe conservation while ensuring the United States does not contribute further to their decline.\"",
      "Specifically, officials said the listing would help giraffes by reducing the illegal hunting and trade of giraffes by requiring permits for import into the U.S. Trade is not the primary factor behind population decline, but it is playing a role, USFWS said. Their hair and tails have long been used in traditional medicine, the agency added, and in recent years giraffes have also been targeted by hunters for bushmeat.",
      "Listing them under the Endangered Species Act would also increase funding for species conservation in range countries and for research efforts to address conservation. It would also provide some limited financial support for developing and managing programs to conserve giraffes, the USFWS said.",
      "Giraffe subspecies from across Africa are at risk, according to the agency. The service proposed listing West African, Kordofan and Nubian giraffes as endangered. It also proposed listing Masai and reticulated giraffes as threatened.",
      "The West African, Kordofan and Nubian \u2014 all subspecies of the northern giraffe \u2014 have seen their population fall around 77% since 1985, according to federal officials. There are around 5,900 left, including only about 690 West African giraffes remain.",
      "The vast majority of reticulated giraffes live in Kenya, and their population is estimated at 15,985, according to USFWS. There are around 45,400 Masai giraffes \u2014 an amount roughly equivalent to 67% of their population in the 1970s.",
      "Giraffes feed on leaves, stems, flowers and fruits, so human population growth and habitat loss can hurt the species. Instances of drought have also led to increased human-wildlife conflicts.",
      "The proposed rule to list the giraffe species has a 90-day comment period.",

      "Russian President Vladimir Putin approved changes to his country's nuclear doctrine this week, formally amending the conditions \u2014 and lowering the threshold \u2014 under which Russia would consider using its nuclear weapons. Moscow announced Tuesday that Putin had signed off on the changes to the doctrine, formally known as \"The basics of state policy in the field of nuclear deterrence,\"  as Ukraine launched its first strike deeper into Russia using U.S.-supplied missiles.",
      "The updated doctrine states that Russia will treat an attack by a non-nuclear state that is supported by a country with nuclear capabilities as a joint attack by both. That means any attack on Russia by a country that's part of a coalition could be seen as an attack by the entire group.",
      "Under the doctrine, Russia could theoretically consider any major attack on its territory, even with conventional weapons, by non-nuclear-armed Ukraine sufficient to trigger a nuclear response, because Ukraine is backed by the nuclear-armed United States.",
      "Putin has threatened to use nuclear weapons in Ukraine multiple times since he ordered the full-scale invasion of the country on Feb. 24, 2022, and Russia has repeatedly warned the West that if Washington allowed Ukraine to fire Western-made missiles deep into its territory, it would consider the U.S. and its NATO allies to be directly involved in the war.",
      "U.S. officials said Ukraine fired eight U.S.-made ATACMS missiles into Russia's Bryansk region early Tuesday, just a couple days after President Biden gave Ukraine permission to fire the weapons deeper into Russian territory. ATACMS are powerful weapons with a maximum range of almost 190 miles.",
      "\"This is the latest instance of a long string of nuclear rhetoric and signaling that has been coming out of Moscow since the beginning of this full scale invasion,\" Mariana Budjeryn, Senior Research Associate at Harvard's Belfer Center, told German broadcaster Deutsche Welle when the change to Russia's nuclear doctrine was first proposed last month.",
      "\"The previous version of the Russian doctrine adopted in 2020 allowed also a nuclear response to a large-scale conventional attack, but only in extreme circumstances where the very survival of the state was at stake,\" Budjeryn noted. \"This formulation has changed to say, well, extreme circumstances that jeopardize the sovereignty of Russia. Well, what does that really mean and who defines what serious threats to sovereignty might constitute?\"",
      "Budjeryn said Russia had already used weapons against Ukraine that could carry a nuclear payload.",
      "\"Russia has been using a number of delivery systems of missiles that [can] also come with a nuclear warhead. So these are dual capable systems. For example, Iskander M short range ballistic missiles. Those have been used extensively in this war by Russia. So when we have an incoming from Russia to Ukraine and we see that it's an Iskander missile, we don't know if it's nuclear tipped or conventionally tipped,\" Budjeryn said.",
      "Ukrainian parliamentarian Oleksandra Ustinova, who says she helped lobby the Biden administration for the permission for Ukraine to fire the ATACMS deeper inside Russia, told CBS News she didn't believe Putin would actually carry out a nuclear strike.",

    "summary": "Canada legalized medically assisted dying in 2016. It was set to expand to patients suffering solely from mental illness last year, but it hasn't \u2014 yet.",
    "story": [
      "When Savannah Meadows had lunch last October with her mother, Sharon Turcott, Meadows was \"all smiles,\" the mother told CBS News.",
      "\"Maybe she's turned a corner,\" Turcott recalled thinking about her daughter, who had been struggling with serious mental illness.",
      "The next morning, she received a scheduled email: \"Mom, if you're reading this, I'm probably on my way to heaven,\" it said. Her daughter had taken her own life at the age of 44.",
      "\"She did not want to die by suicide. She did not want to die alone,\" Turcott said.",
      "Instead, Meadows had been seeking a medically assisted death \u2014 something Canada legalized in 2016. It had been set to expand last year to patients who were suffering solely from mental illness, but that expansion was delayed, and Meadows ultimately died by suicide.",
      "The delay has been welcomed by some, but condemned by others.",
      "The history of Canada's, still evolving MAID law",
      "In 2016, Canada enacted a law allowing medical assistance in dying, known as MAID, for people whose natural death is reasonably foreseeable. Under the law, following a process establishing that all eligibility criteria have been met, a physician or nurse either directly administers a substance that induces death or prescribes a drug that the person takes themselves.",
      "Five years later, the law was expanded, no longer requiring a person's death to be reasonably foreseeable as an eligibility criterion for adults with a grievous and irremediable medical condition. Under the changes, individuals suffering solely from mental illness were temporarily excluded for eligibility until March 2023.",
      "Meadows, described by her mother as a proud trans woman, had picked a date and began preparations for the end of her life.",
      "\"It gave me time to accept the fact that my daughter was going to die,\" Turcott said.",
      "A few days before Meadows would potentially have been eligible to seek a medically assisted death, however, the government announced a yearlong delay for the consideration of cases of mental illness. Seven months later, Meadows died by suicide.",
      "The delayed inclusion of patients seeking MAID on the basis of mental illness has been met with apprehension from the start.",
      "Canada's Expert Panel on MAID and Mental Illness, established to assist in developing the government's approach to the expansion of the law, outlined concerns in a 2022 report, including the daunting task for clinicians asked to make predictions about individual patients and establish incurability and irreversibility despite the difficulties of predicting the evolution of mental disorders.",
      "Another factor was what the report referred to as structural vulnerability, or the risk of factors such as unstable housing or lack of employment opportunities resulting in individuals viewing death as an only option.",
      "The panel offered a number of recommendations in its report for establishing an expanded MAID regime.",
      "The future of the MAID law's expansion, however, is also dependent to some degree on domestic politics, which appear set to shift. Pierre Poilievre, whose Conservative Party is up by a significant margin in polls ahead of national elections set to take place within a year, has vowed to \"revoke entirely\" the expansion of the law to include solely mental health cases, arguing that it blurred a line \"between suicide prevention and suicide  assistance.\"",
      "\"She would have died the way she wanted to.\"",
      "Since her daughter's death, meanwhile, Turcott has become an advocate for MAID access for those whose sole underlying condition is mental illness.",
      "\"She would have died the way she wanted to, and because that's what she wanted, that would have been fine with me,\" Turcott said. \"Suicide was not fine with me.\"",
      "In February, the government further postponed MAID eligibility for patients whose sole condition is mental illness until March 2027 \u2014 four years after it was initially slated to go into effect.",
      "Mark Holland, Canada's Minister of Health, said that while \"significant progress has been made in supporting practitioners in assessing MAID eligibility in complex cases,\" the country's health system was \"not yet ready for MAID where the sole underlying condition is mental illness.\"",
      "The delay has been condemned by some MAID advocates. Dying With Dignity Canada, an organization that advocates for end-of-life rights, filed a lawsuit in August alleging discriminatory exclusion in the law against people with mental illness.",
      "An ongoing debate over access to MAID",
      "Others, however, view the delay as a step to ensure necessary safeguards are in place and health care providers are prepared to handle relevant cases. The Canada Mental Health Association said in a January statement that it supported the postponement, citing what it called insufficient time and resources allocated to ensure that people with mental illnesses can access the necessary care.",
      "Some groups oppose the law's expansion outright. In September, Inclusion Canada, a nonprofit group that advocates for Canadians with intellectual disabilities, filed a lawsuit challenging MAID for people with a disability who are not dying or whose death is not \"reasonably foreseeable.\"",
      "The lawsuit argues that MAID Track 2, the 2021 expansion of the law to include patients whose deaths are not reasonably foreseeable, had already resulted in premature deaths.",
      "\"People are dying. We are witnessing an alarming trend where people with disabilities are seeking assisted suicide due to social deprivation, poverty and lack of essential supports,\" Krista Carr, executive vice-president of Inclusion Canada, said in September.",
      "Compounding CMHA and Inclusion Canada's concerns, an expert committee of professionals from disciplines including ethics, social work and medicine that reviewed MAID deaths in Ontario identified cases in which it said isolation and unmet social needs, such as housing, had fueled several euthanasia recipient's requests.",
      "The committee also found that patients seeking eligibility under the expanded Track 2 criteria were about 8% more likely to reside in areas of the province with high levels of social marginalization than MAID Track 1 recipients.",
      "The committee's report acknowledged that while the deaths discussed were not necessarily representative of frequent reasons for accessing MAID Track 2, or even the majority of MAID Track 2 deaths, the themes identified were \"not uncommon within the MAID review process.\"",
      "Out of 4,644 medically assisted deaths carried out during 2023 under Canada's MAID law, only 116 deaths were Track 2 patients, according to the committee.",
      "But the report's findings don't resonate with everyone, and opposition to the law's proposed inclusion of patients who suffer from only mental illness has been deeply frustrating for some people seeking MAID.",
      "Jason, a Toronto resident who didn't want to be fully identified over concerns that his future MAID review process could be affected, is one of those people.",
      "\"When I first heard that it was delayed, my world came crashing down,\" he said.",
      "Jason told CBS News that he's struggled with depression, anxiety and panic attacks for decades, and has attempted suicide twice. He said he's tried inpatient programs, medication, electroconvulsive therapy and ketamine treatment, among other remedies, to little avail.",
      "\"I would not be alive today if there wasn't the possibility of MAID going through in 2027,\" he said, saying the chance of MAID's expansion was the only reason he hadn't attempted suicide a third time.",
      "The current safeguards for those seeking MAID whose death is not reasonably foreseeable include two independent practitioners \u2014 one of whom must have expertise in the condition affecting the patient \u2014 confirming that all eligibility criteria are met, a minimum period of 90 days for eligibility assessments to be made, and the opportunity for the patient to withdraw consent at any point up until the procedure is carried out.",
      "The patient must also be informed of counseling and palliative care options, support for disabilities and mental health, and be offered consultation with relevant professionals in addition to having discussed with their practitioner \"reasonable and available means to relieve the person's suffering, and agree [with the practitioner] that the person has seriously considered these means.\"",
      "In a poll conducted in 2023 by Dying with Dignity Canada, 78% of respondents said they supported the removal of the \"reasonably foreseeable\" natural death requirement from the MAID law, indicating strong support for the Track 2 expansion. But a 2017 survey gauging the attitudes of Canadian psychiatrists toward medical assistance in death found only a minority of 29.4% supported MAID on the basis of mental illness alone, compared to 71.8% who said other factors should also be present to determine eligibility.",
      "Jason said he understood some doctors' opposition to MAID for mental illness.",
      "\"Doctors are there to make you better,\" he said. But he added that as mental illness isn't something that \"shows up on a screen,\" it can be difficult for people without direct experience to understand the extent of someone else's pain.",
      "\"I don't have the physical pain that someone else has, but the psychological pain is just as bad,\" he said.",
      "In 2022, MAID deaths accounted for 4.1% of overall deaths in Canada, with the average age of MAID patients being 77, according to Canada's fourth and most recent annual report on Medical Assistance in Dying. Since the law was introduced in 2016 there have been a total of 44,958 medically assisted deaths in the country.",
      "Jason said he didn't want to put his family through the trauma of another suicide attempt, and that his brother and mother were helping him explore options abroad. Those options, especially for people suffering mental illness, are limited, and often complicated by varying domestic laws around the world.",
      "Jason said that, like Turcott, his own mother is supportive of his choice to seek MAID.",
      "\"As much as she doesn't want me to do this again, she would rather I die properly with the assistance of a doctor than have it done by suicide,\" he said.",
      "Turcott said she was concerned that the postponement of MAID on the basis of mental health would result in more suicides, leaving families to mourn unexpectedly.",
      "\"I don't want anybody to experience the loss of their child through suicide, and their child being so desperate that they saw no other choice but to take their life,\" she said.",

      "A powerful new documentary is exposing the harsh realities faced by women in Afghanistan under Taliban rule. The film, \"Bread &\u00a0Roses,\" is directed by Afghan filmmaker Sahra Mani, produced by Oscar winner Jennifer Lawrence\u00a0and executive produced by Nobel laureate Malala Yousafzai.",
      "Mani details the grim reality faced by millions of women in Afghanistan under Taliban rule, which drew the attention of Lawrence in 2021.",
      "\"My first reaction when watching that was to do what the Taliban did not want us to do, which was give access and facilities to the people on the ground to capture what was happening on the ground in real-time,\" she said. \"Because obviously the Taliban flourishes in secrecy.\"",
      "Some of the strict limitations imposed on women in Afghanistan under Taliban rule include prohibiting women from working, pursuing education, or even leaving their homes without a male escort. They are also barred from singing, playing music, making films, and, more recently, dining at restaurants or purchasing food in public.",
      "Lawrence and her producing partner, Justine Ciarrocchi, set out to reveal these realities in Afghanistan through the eyes of Afghan women. They enlisted Mani to direct the documentary and Yousafzai joined the project as an executive producer to help amplify its message.",
      "When asked why the Taliban opposes women's education, Yousafzai said, \"We have been trying to figure out an answer to that for the past 30 years\u2026I cannot find any explanation that justifies it to me. How can you stop a girl from her school? They come up with these excuses that it's culture, it's religion. There is no culture, excuse. The true representatives of that culture are the Afghan women and girls that we've seen in the documentary.\"",
      "The documentary follows three Afghan women who secretly filmed their protests. Mani said she wanted to capture the intimate moment of their life and give people an opportunity to see what life is like for Afghan woman under a Taliban dictatorship. But she also wanted to encourage by highlighting their strength.",
      "It's a reality that Lawrence said would be difficult to experience.",
      "\"I can't imagine not being able to take a taxi or being able to listen to music. I can't imagine if just the sound of my voice was illegal,\" she said.",
      "Lawrence, known for her activism, acknowledged the dangers of speaking out but said the stakes were too high to stay silent.",
      "\"There's 20 million women whose lives are in danger,\" she said.",
      "Yousafzai, who survived a Taliban attack in 2012, reflected on the ongoing fight for women's rights.",
      "\"What really shook me was the fact that people stand with you once you have survived, but we don't look at people who are still under a big threat,\" she said. \"Let's share our solidarity with them.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 19 Nov 2024 07:44:09 -0500",
    "summary": "A senior Israeli official has said openly that the West Bank should become part of Israel, not a future Palestine. Could it happen under Trump?",
    "story": [
      "In the wake of former President Donald Trump's re-election, Israel's far-right minister of finance suggested the country would look to annex the occupied West Bank in 2025. Here's what you need to know:",
      "What is the West Bank?",
      "The West Bank is an area of land on the west bank of the Jordan River, which is part of the former British-mandated territory of Palestine. It is surrounded by Israel on three sides \u2014 the north, west, and south \u2014 and it borders the country of Jordan on its east, across the river.",
      "After the departure of British forces in 1948 when the modern state of Israel was created, Arab forces entered and retained the West Bank, and the city of Jerusalem was divided into two sectors: the Israeli west and the Jordanian east.",
      "During the Six-Day War in 1967, Israel occupied the West Bank and established a military administration there. Israel claimed East Jerusalem as part of its own territory, but fighting between the Israelis and the region's Palestinian inhabitants \u2014 who live with significant restrictions on their movement and other aspects of life under the decades-long occupation \u2014 has continued.",
      "Hamas, designated a terrorist organization by the United States and Israel, decisively won a 2006 West Bank parliamentary election over the Western-backed Fatah faction, led by Mahmoud Abbas, which had been administering the Palestinian Authority. The Hamas victory brought sanctions and boycotts by the U.S., the EU and Israel of the new, Hamas-led joint Palestinian leadership.",
      "In 2007, Abbas dissolved the Hamas-led administration in the West Bank and created an emergency cabinet that favored Fatah. The power struggle between the two Palestinian factions led to a split between the West Bank and Gaza, with Western powers supporting the Fatah-administered West Bank diplomatically and economically, while blockading the Hamas-run Gaza Strip.",
      "How could U.S. policy change during the second Trump administration?",
      "The longstanding position of the United States has been support for a two-state solution to the conflict between Israelis and Palestinians, meaning the creation of an independent state of Palestine alongside the independent state of Israel. Most iterations of this policy envision a future Palestinian state made up of the West Bank and East Jerusalem, as well as Gaza.",
      "Trump's previous administration bucked tradition, but did not flat-out reject a two-state solution. Trump moved the U.S. embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem and offered a plan that would have cemented Israeli control over the entire city. It also would have protected Israeli settlements in the West Bank, which are illegal under international law, while moving toward Palestinian self-rule.",
      "President-elect Trump's pick to serve as the next U.S. Ambassador to Israel, former Arkansas governor and Baptist preacher Mike Huckabee, has never supported a two-state solution.",
      "In an interview with The Associated Press when he was running to be the Republican presidential nominee in 2015, Huckabee said that, if elected, his administration would formally recognize the West Bank as part of Israel.",
      "\"I feel that we have a responsibility to respect that this is land that has historically belonged to the Jews,\" Huckabee told the AP.",
      "In a podcast interview earlier this year, Huckabee said that there \"isn't such a thing\" as Palestinians, describing himself as an \"unapologetic, unreformed Zionist.\" He voiced similar views during his campaign in 2008.",
      "Israel \"is an extraordinary oasis in a land of totalitarianism surrounded by tyranny,\" he said on the podcast earlier this year.",
      "Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, Trump's pick for Secretary of State, has repeatedly voiced support for the Israeli government's response to Hamas' brutal Oct. 7, 2023 attack.",
      "\"Although the Biden-Harris Administration has publicly backed Israel's right to defend itself, it has also undercut Israel's maneuverability, leading to a schizophrenic policy towards the region,\" Rubio said in a letter to current Secretary of State Antony Blinken in August.",
      "Voicing his objection to U.S. sanctions against individuals alleged to be supporting \"extremist settler violence\" against Palestinians in the West Bank, Rubio wrote that, \"Israel has consistently sought peace with the Palestinians. It is unfortunate that the Palestinians, whether it be the Palestinian Authority or FTOs such as Hamas, have rejected such overtures. Israelis rightfully living in their historic homeland are not the impediment to peace; the Palestinians are.\"",
      "Israel's far-right government says it's preparing for annexation of the West Bank",
      "Some of those who do not support the creation of an independent Palestinian state do support Israel's annexation of the West Bank, including members of the current far-right Israeli government led by Netanyahu.",
      "Netanyahu's Likud party is currently part of a coalition, formed to keep Netanyahu in power, with radical right-wing nationalist parties such as the Religious Zionist Party.",
      "Netanyahu, who has spoken out against the creation of a Palestinian state, committed to pursuing the annexation of the West Bank in Likud's coalition agreement with the Religious Zionist Party.",
      "\"The people of Israel have a natural right to the Land of Israel,\" the agreement says. \"In light of the belief in the aforementioned right, the Prime Minister will lead the formulation and promotion of a policy within the framework of which sovereignty will be applied in the West Bank, while choosing the timing and considering all national and international interests of the state of Israel.\"",
      "Bezalel Smotrich, the Israeli finance minister who's a member of the Religious Zionist Party, said he believed Israel could work with the incoming Trump administration to promote annexation of the West Bank.",
      "\"I am convinced that we will be able to work closely together with President-elect Trump and all members of the incoming administration, to promote the common values and interests of the two countries, to strengthen the strength and security of the State of Israel, to expand the circle of peace and stability in the Middle East out of strength and faith and on the basis of recognition in the unquestionable historical belonging of the whole Land of Israel to the people of Israel,\" Smotrich said on social media.",
      "Israeli settlements and smaller outposts in the West Bank are illegal under international law. They're also seen as a barrier to a potential two-state solution, because the more Israeli Jews live in the occupied territory, the less likely it seems that Israel would ever abandon control of the land for it to become part of a Palestinian state.",
      "A Pew Research Center survey carried out in the summer found Israelis divided on the potential security risks and benefits of continued settlement expansion, with 40% of respondents saying they help make Israel more secure and 35% saying they hurt security. The survey found 21% of Israelis didn't believe settlement expansion would have any significant impact on security.",
      "Some Israeli activists believe their government is taking advantage of the country's collective grief after the Oct. 7 attack to push an agenda in the West Bank that doesn't have broad public backing.",
      "\"In Israel, there's very little public criticism or any sort of public debate on what is going on in the West Bank,\" Sarit Michaeli, international advocacy lead for the Jerusalem-based rights group B'Tselem, told CBS News of the situation post-Oct. 7 attack. \"Israelis are furious. They're angry. They're hurt. They're traumatized, and this collective trauma has been exploited by our government to push forward policies that most Israelis don't necessarily agree with in the West Bank.\"",
      "In June, the Israeli body that governs the West Bank transferred many powers over the territory from Israeli military officials to civil ones, who work under Smotrich.",
      "Since the Oct. 7 Hamas attack, the monitoring group Peace Now says it has documented at least 43 new illegal outposts in the West Bank, mostly on farmland. Dozens of new roads have been paved to facilitate the establishment of these outposts, the group said.",
      "What would it mean if Israel does annex the West Bank?",
      "In 2020, Tel Aviv University's Institute for National Security Studies (INSS) analyzed what Israeli annexation of the West Bank could actually entail. They looked at three possible scenarios, with Israel either taking full security and administrative control of a portion of the Palestinian territory, or just preventing future evacuation of existing Israeli settlements.",
      "In all three of the scenarios examined, Israeli sovereignty would not necessarily be applied in full to Palestinians in the area. If it were to be, Palestinians would live under the jurisdiction of the State of Israel and, under Israeli law, would be entitled to request citizenship.",
      "The INSS said annexing West Bank territory would make it harder for future Israeli governments to give up that land as part of any deal to create a Palestinian state.",
      "\"In actuality, annexation means tying the hands of future Israeli governments that would be willing to transfer territories for a political settlement,\" the INSS report said.",
      "One senior Palestinian politician in Gaza recently told CBS News that regardless of what changes Israel ushers in under the new leadership in Washington, it would not end the Palestinian people's decades-long fight for a state of their own.",
      "\"We will struggle for our rights,\" Mustafa Barghouti, a doctor in Gaza and the leader of the Palestinian National Initiative party, told CBS News. The Palestinian National Initiative party champions a unified democratic government for both the West Bank and Gaza.",
      "\"It will take time. We will suffer. We know that. But what's the alternative? To cease to exist? It's ethnic cleansing. We cannot accept that,\" Barghouti said.",

      "The Australian Institute of Marine Science said surveys of 12 reefs found up to 72 percent coral mortality, thanks to a summer of mass bleaching, two cyclones, and flooding.",
      "In one northern section of the reef, about a third of hard coral had died, the \"largest annual decline\" in 39 years of government monitoring, the agency said.",
      "Often dubbed the world's largest living structure, the Great Barrier Reef is a 1,400-mile expanse of tropical corals that house a stunning array of biodiversity.",
      "But repeated mass bleaching events have threatened to rob the tourist drawcard of its wonder, turning banks of once-vibrant corals into a sickly shade of white.",
      "Bleaching occurs when water temperatures rise and the coral expels microscopic algae, known as zooxanthellae, to survive.",
      "If high temperatures persist, the coral can eventually turn white and die.",
      "This year had already been confirmed as the fifth mass bleaching on the reef in the past eight years.",
      "But this latest survey also found a rapid-growing type of coral -- known as acropora -- had suffered the highest rate of death.",
      "This coral is quick to grow, but one of the first to bleach.",
      "Lead researcher Mike Emslie told public broadcaster ABC the past summer was \"one of the most severe events\" across the Great Barrier Reef, with heat stress levels surpassing previous events.",
      "\"These are serious impacts. These are serious losses,\" he said.",

      "Typically caused by bacteria, viruses or mold exposure, the condition causes swelling in the airways and fluid in the lungs.",
      "BIRD FLU LEAVES TEEN IN CRITICAL CONDITION AFTER COUNTRY'S FIRST REPORTED CASE",

      "\"Although flu doesn't usually cause pneumonia, it can cause secondary pneumonia where you get these infections on top of influenza,\" the doctor cautioned. (iStock)",
      "The resurgence of these pneumonia-causing bacteria and viruses could be a delayed effect of the masking and lockdowns that occurred during the pandemic, the doctor said.",
      "\"On top of that, we're not as well-vaccinated as we should be,\" he said. \"And physicians are not on the lookout enough \u2026 I'm urging them to be on the lookout for atypical pneumonias.\"",

      "iOS 18.1 brings a slew of AI-powered features aimed at enhancing your experience with Siri and Apple Intelligence, but it\u2019s worth questioning: How much does your iPhone really need to know about you? If you're like most people, privacy is a top priority, especially when it comes to sensitive data such as banking information, health details and your location.",
      "When Apple Intelligence is enabled, it starts \"learning\" from your interactions with certain apps, creating a digital profile that can theoretically tailor your experience. This is a double-edged sword; while personalization might sound appealing, it\u2019s crucial to consider what data Apple\u2019s AI is learning and why you might want to limit its reach.",

      "It\u2019s no secret that America\u2019s immigration policy is in desperate need of a high-tech overhaul.\u00a0 Most online immigration tools so far have been rudimentary, and that\u2019s often left legal immigrants complaining of long wait times, contradictory instructions, and a web presence that doesn't help with things like green card renewal or family petitions.\u00a0 Now President-Elect Trump is promising a big deportation push when he comes into office for his second term, and it\u2019s more important than ever for immigrants to have their paperwork in order.",
      "\"Immigration, legal immigration should be efficient and accessible and affordable for everyone,\" says Yasaman Soroori, the co-founder and CEO of Consulta, a new A.I.-powered platform offering high-tech solutions for those immigration issues.\u00a0 It\u2019s thought to be the first online platform dedicated specifically to helping legal immigrants navigate America\u2019s complicated immigration landscape.\u00a0 Their goal is simple;\u00a0 integrating tech with personalized support, hoping to bring order and affordability to a complex and costly process.",

At that time, there was no confirmation from the retailer itself. However, a breach notification site has now confirmed that the personal data of 56,904,909 users was found online and leaked from customers of Hot Topic, Torrid and Box Lunch.",

While Hot Topic, which operates more than 640 stores across the U.S., has yet to confirm the breach, HIBP reported that it occurred on Oct. 19. Just two days later, a threat actor using the alias \"Satanic\" claimed responsibility.",
      "Satanic alleges that the database contains details of 350 million users, though that number seems inflated. The leaked data does, however, include names, email addresses, physical addresses and dates of birth; all information collected through Hot Topic\u2019s loyalty program. The hacker is offering the database for $20,000 and demanding that Hot Topic pay $100,000 to prevent its sale.",

The firm traced the issue back to a malware infection on an employee\u2019s computer at Robling, a third-party retail analytics firm. Hudson Rock, which operates the cyber intelligence platform Cavalier to monitor compromised devices, discovered the infection and flagged it for clients.",

Hot Topic\u2019s silence could mean a few things, especially with such a big breach.

      "1) Keep a strong password:\u00a0With the Hot Topic data breach exposing sensitive information, it\u2019s essential to update your passwords. Use a strong, unique password for each account, especially for services where your personal details are stored. A mix of letters, numbers and symbols will make it harder for hackers to guess. Consider using a\u00a0password manager to keep everything secure and easily accessible.",
      "2) Beware of suspicious links:\u00a0After a breach, phishing attempts increase, and hackers may use your leaked email to send fake links or emails. Never click on suspicious links, especially those that ask for personal information. Always double-check the sender's email and look out for strange language or urgent requests. If in doubt, go directly to the website instead of following the links in the message.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2024 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "3) Invest in a data removal service:\u00a0Since your personal information could be floating around on the dark web or public databases, it\u2019s a good idea to invest in a data removal service.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "4) Watch out for the risk of identity theft:\u00a0The leaked data includes sensitive details like addresses, birthdays and purchase histories, which could be used for identity theft. Be extra cautious when sharing personal information moving forward, and if you notice anything unusual, report it immediately. If you are a Hot Topic customer, you might also want to consider an identity theft monitoring service.\u00a0See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft.",
      "5) Monitor your accounts regularly:\u00a0Keep an eye on your bank accounts, credit card statements and even loyalty programs where your information is stored. Set up alerts for transactions and logins so you can act fast if anything seems off. Regular monitoring can help you catch fraudulent activity early, minimizing the damage if your data is misused.",

      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "The Hot Topic data breach is alarming, especially since it affects over 56 million people. What makes the situation even more concerning is that Hot Topic has stayed silent about it. The company hasn\u2019t notified those affected, leaving many unprepared for potential cybersecurity threats. Hackers could use this gap to target victims with scams, leading to financial losses. This situation is a strong reminder of the importance of maintaining good cybersecurity hygiene, whether you\u2019re impacted by a breach or not.",

That\u2019s probably why U.S. phone giant T-Mobile was hacked as part of a broad cyberattack on domestic and international phone and internet companies in recent months.",

      "What you need to know",
      "There was unauthorized access to a limited number of T-Mobile routers using methods indicative of a major Chinese cyber-espionage operation, but T-Mobile\u2019s layered defenses and security monitoring enabled T-Mobile to quickly identify and shut down the threat.",
      "The report revealed that hackers connected to a Chinese intelligence agency breached T-Mobile as part of a monthslong effort to spy on the cellphone communications of high-value intelligence targets. The report did not specify when the attack occurred, but T-Mobile says no customer calls or communication records were stolen.",
      "The U.S. government also\u00a0confirmed this month that Chinese hackers breached multiple U.S. telecommunications service providers to access wiretap systems used by law enforcement for surveillance of Americans. Wiretap systems allow law enforcement agencies to monitor phone calls, text messages and internet communications as part of investigations, typically with a warrant.",
      "CISA (Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency) and the FBI issued a joint statement revealing \"a broad and significant\" cyber-espionage campaign. The statement disclosed that PRC-affiliated hackers had breached networks at \"multiple telecommunications companies\" across the United States. While CISA and the FBI did not name the organizations affected, multiple reports suggest that T-Mobile, AT&T, Lumen (formerly CenturyLink) and Verizon are likely on the list.",
      "WSJ reported in October that Chinese hackers had access to the networks \"for months or longer,\" enabling them to collect \"internet traffic from internet service providers that count businesses large and small and millions of Americans as their customers.\"",

      "T-Mobile has faced several hacks in recent years. In 2021, a malicious actor breached T-Mobile\u2019s lab environment by posing as a legitimate connection to an unidentified piece of equipment. The hacker guessed passwords for multiple servers and moved laterally through the network, ultimately stealing personal data, including names, addresses, Social Security numbers and driver\u2019s license IDs, from tens of millions of customers.",
      "In 2022, T-Mobile experienced another breach when a malicious actor used SIM-swapping, phishing and other tactics to infiltrate the company\u2019s internal platform for managing mobile resellers who serve T-Mobile customers.",
      "The troubles continued into 2023. Early in the year, hackers used phished credentials from dozens of T-Mobile retail employees to access a sales application originally set up during the COVID-19 pandemic for remote viewing of customer data. Then, in January 2023, a misconfigured application programming interface exposed personal data for 37 million current customers, marking yet another significant security lapse.",

Due to our security controls, network structure and diligent monitoring and response we have seen no significant impacts to T-Mobile systems or data. We have no evidence of access or exfiltration of any customer or other sensitive information as other companies may have experienced.

      "WHAT TO DO IF YOUR BANK ACCOUNT IS HACKED",
      "5 ways to stay safe amid the rise in telecom data breaches",
      "1) Change your passwords regularly: Make it a habit to update your passwords every few months, especially for your telecom accounts and related services. Use strong, unique passwords that include a mix of letters, numbers and symbols.\u00a0Password managers can help you generate and store these securely.",
      "2) Invest in personal data removal services: Consider services that scrub your personal information from public databases. This reduces the chances of your data being exploited in phishing or other cyberattacks after a breach.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "3) Use identity theft protection: Identity theft protection services monitor your accounts for unusual activity, alert you to potential threats and can even assist in resolving issues if your data is compromised.\u00a0See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft.",
      "4) Enable two-factor authentication (2FA): Add an extra layer of security to your telecom accounts with\u00a02FA. This requires a second form of verification, like a text code or an app-based prompt, making it harder for hackers to access your accounts even if they have your password.",
      "5) Guard against phishing scams with strong antivirus software: Be cautious about unsolicited calls, texts or emails that ask for personal information or account access. Legitimate companies won't ask for sensitive details this way. If something seems off, contact your telecom provider directly through official channels. Whatever you do, don't click on links, as they can lead to scams or malware.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2024 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "Telecom providers like T-Mobile and AT&T are frequent targets for hackers. Over the last two years, millions of Americans have had their data stolen, things like call records, text messages and even personal details. The issue got so bad that the FCC stepped in, warning T-Mobile to step up its cybersecurity efforts. The company was fined about $30 million, split between a $15 million penalty and a mandatory $15 million investment in better security. Unfortunately, if the companies handling your data keep getting breached, there's only so much you can do.",

      "Many people turn to VPNs \u2014 virtual private networks \u2014 for added privacy and security online, only to find that their internet speeds suddenly slow to a crawl. But what exactly does a VPN do, and why might it cause this slowdown?",
      "A VPN works by creating a secure, encrypted pathway between your device and the internet, keeping your data private from hackers, advertisers and anyone else trying to monitor your activity. This encryption process also allows you to browse as if you\u2019re in a different location, which can help access content that may be restricted where you are.",

      "2. Run a speed test at Speedtest.net and note the results: Click the \"Go\" button and wait for the test to complete. Write down your download and upload speeds, as well as the ping.",
      "3. Connect to your VPN: Open your VPN application and connect to your preferred server. Wait until the connection is fully established.",
      "4. Run the speed test again: Refresh the Speedtest.net page to ensure it detects your new location, then run the test again. Note down the new results.",

      "TOP 6 HIDDEN WAYS A VPN CAN SAVE YOU MONEY NOW",
      "Fixing VPN speed issues",
      "When encountering slow speeds while using a VPN, it's crucial to approach the problem systematically. Assuming the VPN is indeed the bottleneck in your connection, there are several steps you can employ to potentially boost your speeds and improve your overall experience.",
      "The physical distance between you and the VPN server location plays a significant role in connection speeds. Opting for a server closer to your geographical location can often result in a noticeable improvement. If you need to connect to a specific country for content access or other reasons, experiment with different cities within that country. Many VPN providers offer multiple server options in popular locations. Additionally, some VPNs display server load information, which can be incredibly useful. Connecting to a less crowded server typically yields faster speeds, as you're sharing fewer resources with other users.",
      "CLICK HERE FOR MORE U.S. NEWS",
      "Various server locations available on VPN. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Adjusting your VPN settings can lead to performance enhancements. If your VPN service allows for customization, consider lowering the encryption level from 256-bit to 128-bit AES. While 256-bit encryption is incredibly secure, it can sometimes impact speed. The 128-bit AES encryption is still considered very secure for most purposes and may offer a speed boost. Another setting to look for is the WireGuard protocol. If your VPN provider offers this newer protocol, enabling it could significantly improve your connection speed, as it's designed to be both faster and more efficient than older protocols. For those using the OpenVPN protocol, switching from TCP to UDP can often result in faster speeds. However, approach these changes cautiously, especially if you're not entirely sure about their implications. Avoid disabling critical security features in your quest for speed.",
      "Different protocols offer varying levels of speed and security. Generally, protocols like PPTP, L2TP and IKEv2 are known for their speed but may not provide the highest level of security. OpenVPN is often the default choice as it strikes a good balance between speed and security. If you decide to stick with OpenVPN, which is recommended for most users, try switching from TCP to UDP. This simple change can potentially provide a noticeable speed boost without compromising security.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "Keeping your VPN application up to date is essential for ensuring optimal performance and security. VPN providers frequently release updates that not only enhance the overall functionality of their software but also address any bugs or vulnerabilities that may have been discovered. An outdated VPN app can lead to compatibility issues with your operating system, which can hinder performance and reduce connection speeds. Therefore, it is advisable to regularly check for updates within your VPN app's settings or visit the provider's official website to download the latest version. Additionally, many VPN services offer an automatic update feature, which you should enable to ensure that you are always using the most current version of the software without having to remember to do it manually.",
      "To improve your VPN speed, it is important to minimize the load on your device by closing unnecessary applications running in the background. Many applications consume bandwidth and processing power, which can significantly affect your VPN's performance. For instance, streaming services, file-sharing programs or even software that automatically updates can slow down your connection. Before connecting to your VPN, take a moment to close these apps and consider disabling any auto-sync features temporarily.\u00a0Also, restarting your device before initiating a VPN connection is also a good practice, as it clears temporary files and frees up memory, allowing for a smoother experience.",
      "If you have tried various troubleshooting methods and your current VPN service still fails to deliver satisfactory speeds, it may be time to explore other options. The market is filled with numerous VPN providers that emphasize speed and reliability, so conducting thorough research is essential. Look for services that boast a large network of servers strategically located around the world, as this can significantly enhance connection speeds. Many top-tier VPN providers offer free trials or money-back guarantees, allowing you to test their performance without any financial risk. When evaluating potential new services, consider not only their speed but also their security features, privacy policies and customer support options. By making an informed choice, you can find a VPN that meets both your speed requirements and security needs effectively.",
      "Remember, while these strategies can help optimize your VPN speed, it's important to have realistic expectations. Your base internet speed, provided by your internet service provider (ISP), will always be the ultimate limiting factor. No VPN can make your connection faster than the maximum speed your ISP provides. However, by implementing these techniques, you can ensure that you're getting the most out of your VPN connection and minimizing any unnecessary slowdowns.",

This incredible piece of tech solves a major problem that other exoskeletons face. You see, most exoskeletons require helpers to lift users out of their wheelchairs and strap them in. But the WalkON Suit F1? It's got a nifty front-docking system that lets the person put it on while still seated in their wheelchair. Talk about independence.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "The suit features a system \"that actively controls the center of its weight against the pull of gravity\" to prevent it from toppling over as the person stands up.

      "And let's not forget about the vision recognition system, which allows the suit to spot and navigate around obstacles, adding an extra layer of safety and independence for the user.",
      "The team has made some serious advancements in the components. They've domestically produced all the core parts, including the motor, reducer, motor driver and main circuit. The motor's output density has improved twofold, and the control performance of the motor driver is about three times better than the best overseas technology. Now, that's what I call progress.",

      "The use of Kamal Adwan Hospital by Hamas has been previously confirmed, including by Ahmad Kahlot, a high-ranking Hamas member and former director of the hospital. In December 2023, Kahlot admitted that Kamal Adwan Hospital was used \"to hide high-ranking military activists,\" who know they \"won\u2019t be targeted when they are in the hospital.\" The hospital, he said, contained housing for the terrorists as well as \"areas for interrogations, internal and special security.\"",

      "Bayefsky noted that Israel has \"publicly exposed, with photographic and video evidence, the use of hospitals by Hamas for military purposes,\" including underground tunnels \"that utilized the power sources and served as command centers and weapons depots; weapons and equipment on hospital floors alongside patient wards; weapons hidden in incubators; and the use of hospitals as operational facilities to direct military activity.\"",

      "In its report, the commission also described how \"two [Israeli] hostages had been held in [Gazan] hospitals and received medical treatment for their wounds.\" What the commission failed to mention, according to Bayefsky, is that the hostages\u2019 \"treatment\" involved \"doctors pouring chlorine and vinegar onto hostage\u00a0Maya Regev's dangling foot in order to cause pain,\" or cutting \"into her without pain relievers.\" They also fail to address how \"Gazan doctors pulled a bullet from hostage\u00a0Itay Regev's leg without using anesthesia while Hamas members spat on him, slapped him and threatened to kill him if he screamed.\"",
      "Fox News Digital asked the Commission of Inquiry why it did not include information about the use of Kamal Adwan Hospital by Hamas, why it failed to recount the maltreatment Israeli hostages received, and whether it believed there could be a non-military purpose for the Hamas tunnels found below medical facilities.",
      "A spokesperson from the commission told Fox News Digital that the report\u2019s findings \"were made in accordance with international standards and based on reasonable grounds to believe.\" The spokesperson explained the commission used \"specific hospitals\" as \"emblematic cases,\" and lamented that the commission has not been allowed into Gaza \"to conduct investigations on the ground or speak to victims and witnesses.\"",

      "Mimran also added that the provision of international law that protects against entry into a hospital \"can be eroded if the hospital is being misused in order to bring about a military advantage to Hamas,\" whether it is being used to store weapons, act as a headquarters, or holds hostages. In those cases, \"Israel has a right to enter the hospital, to operate from within the hospital,\" but must \"minimize any harm to the functionality of the hospital.\" If a hospital is being used as a permanent structure to \"promote attacks against an army,\" Israel could \"treat the hospital as a military object.\"",

    "summary": "As Democrats dissect what went wrong in the election, the are beginning the process of choosing their next national party committee chair.",
    "story": [
      "Welcome to the online version of\u00a0From the Politics Desk, an evening newsletter that brings you the NBC News Politics team\u2019s latest reporting and analysis from the White House, Capitol Hill and the campaign trail.",
      "In today\u2019s edition, senior national politics reporters Natasha Korecki and Alex Seitz-Wald break down the early state of the race to be the next Democratic National Committee chair. Plus, chief political analyst Chuck Todd explores how Donald Trump is quickly burning through his political capital.",
      "Sign up to receive this newsletter in your inbox every weekday here.",
      "After a stinging election defeat, the race to lead the DNC kicks off",
      "Two weeks after suffering another stinging defeat to Donald Trump, Democrats are in the throes of dissecting what went wrong and figuring out their path forward.",
      "And the first concrete step in beginning their next chapter is already underway: selecting a new chair of the national party committee.",
      "The post will take on outsize importance for a defeated party lacking a clear leader, especially in the run-up to the 2028 presidential election, when the new chair will have to oversee the party\u2019s primary and its controversial new calendar imposed by President Joe Biden.",
      "Over the past 48 hours, a bevy of contenders interested in succeeding Jaime Harrison as the chair of the Democratic National Committee have either officially jumped into the race or seen their names floated as options.",
      "It started Monday, when former Maryland Gov. Martin O\u2019Malley, a onetime presidential candidate and the commissioner of the Social Security Administration, kicked off the race by entering the fray. Minnesota Democratic Party Chair Ken Martin, a DNC vice chair and leader of the Association of State Democratic Committees, followed by formally announcing his candidacy Tuesday.",
      "Both Martin and O\u2019Malley stressed ongoing investments in state parties as key to their vision for moving the DNC forward.",
      "Also on Tuesday, Latino Democratic strategist Chuck Rocha confirmed on X that he was in the running. So far, the only woman to emerge as a possible candidate, as Politico reported, is Michigan state Sen. Mallory McMorrow. She drew national acclaim on the left in 2022 after she delivered a speech in defiance of a Republican who cast her as a \u201cgroomer\u201d in a fundraising appeal, which led to a speaking slot at this summer\u2019s Democratic National Convention.",
      "Still looming out there: Wisconsin Democratic Party Chair Ben Wikler, who has developed a reputation as a prodigious fundraiser and field organizer.",
      "\u201cBen is seriously considering a run,\u201d a person with knowledge of Wikler\u2019s thinking told NBC News on Monday.",
      "That\u2019s on top of chatter around Rahm Emanuel, the U.S. ambassador to Japan, former Chicago mayor and chief of staff to then-President Barack Obama. Emanuel has reached out to other DNC members to test the waters, according to two people close to him.",
      "The DNC vice chair position is also drawing attention. Adam Parkhomenko, a Democratic operative who worked on Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential campaigns, is considering a bid for the post, for which he unsuccessfully ran in 2017.",
      "\u201cI am seriously considering stepping back into the race, and I promise to take the time to weigh this decision carefully, with the same dedication to our party and values that I\u2019ve always carried,\u201d Parkhomenko said in a message to supporters obtained by NBC News.",
      "Also eyeing a run for the vice chair position is James Zogby, the founder of the Arab American Institute and longtime former DNC member who has criticized the party from the left.",
      "While it\u2019s still too early to get a clear sense of the fault lines that will define the DNC leadership races, the 50-state strategy could be one. This is a vision \u2014 investing in red, blue and swing states alike \u2014 that Martin in particular has fully embraced. If Emanuel does get into the race, it\u2019s a strategy he famously opposed, even getting into a public feud with Howard Dean over it, arguing the party should train its focus on battleground states.",
      "The race could also expose divisions between an old era, one that embraced Obama \u2014 who had drastically diminished the role of the DNC and state parties by setting up a parallel entity in Organizing for America \u2014 and new faces who would bring fresh ideas to a party in search of a way forward.",
      "Trump is burning his political capital quickly",
      "Here\u2019s the political problem Donald Trump is creating for himself with his picks for the Cabinet and other positions: He\u2019s taking full ownership of the entire bureaucracy now. There is no fantasy or mythical \u201cdeep state\u201d to blame for not fulfilling his promises. He\u2019s appointing folks he says share his vision \u2014 so no excuses of being jammed by the ol\u2019 establishment wing of the GOP (like what happened in his first term).",
      "This time, he has to deliver, and his ability to deliver depends on whether he can put together a stable set of political actors to not only do his bidding but also somehow deliver on his promises to a whole new group of voters who are \u201ctrying out\u201d Trumpism for the very first time.",
      "If the next six months at the Pentagon are more about which bathrooms folks can or can\u2019t use and who can or can\u2019t defend the country, Trump is going to find himself taking more of the heat for his controversial pick of defense chief than his actual pick for the post.",
      "There are a lot of potential land mines that Trump and the newly empowered GOP need to avoid. One is misreading their mandate on the culture front.",
      "What many voters appeared to say with their votes, culturally, is that they don\u2019t like to be told how they should behave. There\u2019s a fierce libertarian streak in this country, and it can look \u201cleft\u201d or \u201cright\u201d depending on which party is in power. If the Republicans go from preaching against \u201cDEI\u201d to essentially imposing their own culture, forcing Bible study in public schools (see Oklahoma) or using gender stereotypes rather than pure merit to decide whether someone belongs on the front lines of combat, then they will be committing the same sin they accused coastal elites of committing, of \u201cimposing their own culture\u201d on a public that doesn\u2019t agree with their every belief.",
      "And this is the very risk Trump has already invited by deciding to pick the most controversial firebrand one could find in some of these key positions. If his picks cause instability, the public will reject this administration faster than he thinks.",
      "One thing Trump and the GOP are already misreading about his so-called mandate is that he was elected despite his personal unpopularity. That is, he wasn\u2019t elected proactively by the voters who took him over the edge; he was elected because of who he was not.",
      "This wasn\u2019t a decision voters made because they like Trump. To the contrary, they made this decision because they didn\u2019t think the Biden-Harris administration understood how they live their lives. Does Trump understand it? Perhaps he doesn\u2019t, but he certainly knew how to channel their frustrations into a vote-getting message, and he certainly exposed the Democrats as not having any clue about how the working class was faring in this economy.",
      "But these moments of peak political capital are fleeting, and when they go, they go. Just ask Biden.",

    "published": "Thu, 21 Nov 2024 01:00:30 GMT",
    "summary": "Three of President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s high-profile picks to join his Cabinet have faced serious allegations of sexual impropriety.",
    "story": [
      "Three of President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s high-profile picks to join his Cabinet have faced serious allegations of sexual impropriety, complicating the calculus for Republican senators already weighing their professional qualifications as they decide whether to go along with their party leader on key government posts.",
      "His choice for attorney general, former Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., is accused of having sex with a 17-year-old and paying two other women for sex. Trump\u2019s pick for defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, was accused of sexual assault. And his selection for health and human services secretary, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., was accused this summer of groping a former family babysitter.",
      "Gaetz and Hegseth have denied the allegations. Kennedy responded to the allegation against him over the summer by saying: \u201cI said in my announcement speech that I have so many skeletons in my closet that if they could all vote, I could run for king of the world.\u201d NBC News reported that he apologized to the woman over text messages this year.",
      "Trump himself has faced various sexual misconduct allegations, which he has denied, though he was found liable last year for sexual abuse in a civil trial over an alleged incident in the 1990s that he also denies. Now, after having won the presidency again, he\u2019s spending early political capital to confirm appointees who have faced sexual misconduct allegations of their own.",
      "\u201cI do think it\u2019s smart politics for the president to pick a fight with Congress \u2014 he is a change agent that people sent to disrupt, and there are few institutions people dislike more than Congress. But he undercuts that message when he wants to have a fight over Matt Gaetz,\u201d said Marc Short, an NBC News contributor who was former Vice President Mike Pence\u2019s chief of staff.",
      "\u201cFrom the last couple of decades we\u2019ve gone from not disclosing payments for nannies as being disqualifying to now, I just think the people around the president know he wants to see them fight through bad news cycles,\u201d Short added.",
      "The allegations against Trump\u2019s picks",
      "Gaetz\u2019s years of controversies have been thrust back into the spotlight now that he\u2019s up for a Cabinet post. While one of Gaetz\u2019s former associates pleaded guilty to charges including sex trafficking of a minor, the Justice Department ended its sex trafficking investigation into Gaetz, who resigned from Congress after Trump selected him, and didn\u2019t charge him with any crimes. Meanwhile, a House Ethics Committee investigation had been ongoing before he resigned.",
      "Some details from that investigation have become public \u2014 on Monday, a lawyer representing two women who testified in front of the Ethics Committee told NBC News that Gaetz paid them for sex on several occasions, including at a small, invitation-only party in Florida. The lawyer also added that one woman saw Gaetz having sex with her 17-year-old friend but added that she believed Gaetz didn\u2019t realize she was a minor and that he ended their \u201csexual relationship\u201d until she became a legal adult.",
      "Hegseth has been accused of sexually assaulting a woman in 2017, an allegation he denied through a lawyer who said that the encounter was consensual and that the two entered into a \u201ccivil confidential settlement agreement [even as Hegseth] maintains his innocence.\u201d",
      "NBC News hasn\u2019t independently reviewed a memo that The Washington Post reported was sent to the Trump transition team by a friend of the accuser. Tim Parlatore, Hegseth\u2019s attorney, confirmed it was related to the encounter.",
      "And this year, Vanity Fair published a lengthy profile of Kennedy that included a conversation with one of his family\u2019s former nannies, who said he groped her. Asked about the allegation on a podcast this summer, Kennedy responded by brushing it aside, saying: \u201cI am not a church boy.\u201d",
      "Short noted the difficult political cross-pressures that Republican senators will face ahead of, in particular, the Gaetz confirmation vote. While some GOP senators have agreed they want to see the House Ethics Committee\u2019s report on Gaetz, none have ruled out voting for him.",
      "Republican senators up for re-election in 2026 \u201care put in a really tough spot, because if they oppose Trump\u2019s nominee, the concern is that Trump will help recruit a primary opponent. But if they support somebody like Matt Gaetz, you\u2019re all but guaranteeing a more difficult general election. You\u2019re in a catch-22,\u201d Short said.",
      "As Trump\u2019s picks face scrutiny, multiple Cabinet hopefuls in the last few decades have had to step aside over accusations they hired undocumented household workers \u2014 including several during Bill Clinton\u2019s and George H.W. Bush\u2019s administrations, although nominees during President Barack Obama\u2019s tenure and Trump\u2019s first term were, in some cases, able to get through. Others have had issues with their finances, as well as accusations of personal or professional misconduct.",
      "Trump\u2019s past picks haven\u2019t been immune, either.",
      "In 2017, Andy Puzder, Trump\u2019s nominee for labor secretary, withdrew from his confirmation battle amid scrutiny of his business record, concerns he hired an undocumented household employee and the emergence of video of his ex-wife accusing him of domestic abuse. Puzder said he was unaware the employee was an undocumented immigrant, and a spokesperson told Politico at the time that his ex-wife\u2019s comments were \u201cretracted 30-year-old allegations.\u201d",
      "In 2018, Trump acting Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan withdrew from consideration to lead the Pentagon in a permanent capacity after The Post reported on domestic violence incidents involving members of his family. (Shanahan claimed the reporting \u201cpainted an incomplete and therefore misleading\u201d picture of the incidents.)",
      "Also that year, Dr. Ronny Jackson (then the White House physician, who later became a member of Congress) withdrew his name from consideration to lead the Department of Veterans Affairs amid allegations of professional impropriety. (Jackson called the allegations \u201ccompletely false and fabricated.\u201d)",
      "And at the end of 2018, Trump made a direct appeal to young men in trying to discredit a sexual assault allegation raised against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, who denied the allegation. Kavanaugh was confirmed.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a very scary time for young men in America when you can be guilty of something that you may not be guilty of,\u201d Trump told reporters.",
      "\u201cYou can be somebody that was perfect your entire life, and somebody could accuse you of something,\u201d he said.",
      "Trump sticking with his choices",
      "Now, team Trump is standing by its picks and picking up its efforts on Capitol Hill ahead of next year\u2019s confirmation hearings.",
      "A transition official told NBC News that when Trump initially called to inform Gaetz of his plan to nominate him for attorney general, Gaetz told Trump, \u201cThis whole thing is going to be an uphill battle.\u201d The official added that Trump replied that it was a battle he wanted to fight and said Trump has been making calls to GOP senators himself.",
      "Addressing the potential difficulty of getting some of Trump\u2019s controversial picks confirmed, another transition official said: \u201cThe president wants these nominees in his administration, and it is our job to make that happen,\u201d adding that while \u201cwe know this will be hard, we just won an unprecedented election\u201d and that Trump \u201cwants this done, and we will get it done.\u201d",
      "Trump briefly told reporters Wednesday he isn\u2019t reconsidering Gaetz\u2019s nomination. And Vice President-elect JD Vance hit Capitol Hill this week to arrange meetings for key GOP senators with Gaetz and Hegseth, a source familiar with the plans said.",
      "Asked about both the substance of the allegations against Gaetz, Hegseth and Kennedy and whether there are concerns that could complicate their confirmations, Karoline Leavitt, a Trump-Vance transition spokeswoman who is the incoming White House press secretary, said in a statement that Trump\u2019s election was a \u201cresounding mandate from the American people to change the status quo in Washington. That\u2019s why he has chosen brilliant and highly-respected outsiders to serve in his administration.\u201d",
      "\u201cHe will continue to stand behind them as they fight against all those who seek to derail the MAGA agenda,\u201d Leavitt added."

    "published": "Wed, 20 Nov 2024 21:21:01 GMT",

    "story": [
      "Incoming Trump administration advisers Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy on Wednesday floated ending remote work for federal workers, calling the practice a \u201cprivilege\u201d left over from the pandemic.",
      "The two tech industry figures raised the idea in an opinion piece published online in The Wall Street Journal, saying it would be a straightforward means for shrinking the federal workforce.",
      "\u201cRequiring federal employees to come to the office five days a week would result in a wave of voluntary terminations that we welcome: If federal employees don\u2019t want to show up, American taxpayers shouldn\u2019t pay them for the Covid-era privilege of staying home,\u201d the two men wrote.",
      "That could affect more than 1 million federal workers. About 1.1 million federal civilian employees, or 46% of civilian personnel, are eligible for some amount of telework, according to an August report from the Office of Management and Budget. About 228,000 employees, or 10% of personnel, are in remote positions with no expectation that they work in-person on any regular or recurring basis, the report said.",
      "The Biden administration ordered federal agencies in 2023 to \u201csubstantially increase meaningful in-person work,\u201d but it also left some flexibility in place, citing operational costs like office space, the need to recruit \u201ctop talent\u201d and other factors.",
      "Musk and Ramaswamy are co-heads of what President-elect Donald Trump has called a Department of Government Efficiency, although their roles are advisory and it won\u2019t be an official department unless Congress passes a law creating it. The acronym, DOGE, is a reference to an internet meme and cryptocurrency that Musk has promoted for years.",
      "The suggestions made in the opinion piece are some of the first concrete policy suggestions the pair have advocated for in relation to their new roles.",
      "In the lead-up to Trump\u2019s election and during the transition, Musk has been an increasingly present and influential figure in Trump\u2019s orbit, repeatedly appearing with Trump in meetings with lawmakers and world leaders.",
      "Musk, the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, has taken a strict approach to remote work at his companies since the Covid-19 pandemic began to wind down. Musk announced a return-to-office policy at Tesla and SpaceX in 2022, ordering employees back for a minimum of 40 hours per week on site, though his edict was hampered at the time by a lack of space and resources, CNBC reported then.",
      "The future of remote work for office-based employees is hotly debated. While some companies such as Amazon have joined Tesla and SpaceX in calling workers back, other companies are using remote work as a recruiting and retention tool that appears to have some staying power.",
      "Some unionized federal workers have criticized Musk and Ramaswamy, saying they don\u2019t know what they\u2019re doing.",
      "\u201cIt is clear that Musk and Ramaswamy simply do not understand how the federal workforce is staffed or operated,\u201d said Randy Erwin, national president of the National Federation of Federal Employees, in a statement about DOGE\u2019s work generally.",
      "Erwin said the two tech figures \u201cmake absurd claims about government waste and bash dedicated federal employees.\u201d His union says it represents 110,000 federal employees.",
      "In their opinion piece, the two also suggested other ways to cut federal jobs including \u201clarge-scale firings\u201d and the \u201crelocation of federal agencies out of the Washington area.\u201d They also outlined a series of other ideas for cutting federal spending and repealing government regulations and cited recent Supreme Court precedent that they said would give Trump wide leeway."

    "summary": "Outgoing Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin called women and racial diversity in the armed forces as vital to its strength, he said in an interview with NBC News.",
    "story": [
      "VIENTIANE, Laos \u2014 Women and racial diversity are vital to the strength of U.S. armed forces, outgoing Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said in an exclusive interview with NBC News as he prepares to shortly exit the top military post after four years.",
      "\u201cI have spent 41 years in uniform, three long tours in Iraq, one in Afghanistan, and everywhere I went on a battlefield, there were women in our formation,\u201d Austin said. \u201cI would tell you that, you know, our women are the finest troops in the world. Quite frankly, some of the finest in the world.\u201d",
      "President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s choice for defense secretary is Pete Hegseth, a former Army National Guard major whose past comments about women in combat have raised questions and concerns.",
      "Hegseth said on a podcast released this month that the military \u201cshould not have women in combat roles\u201d and that \u201cmen in those positions are more capable.\u201d",
      "Women made up 17.5% of the U.S. military's active-duty force and 21.6% of the selected reserve in 2022, the Defense Department said in a report last November.",
      "\"They do impact readiness. They make us better. They make us stronger. And again, what I've seen from our women is quite incredible, and I'm not \u2014 this is not hyperbole. This is fact,\" Austin said.",
      "Hegseth has also said he wants the military to be purged of \u201cwoke\u201d officials who support diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives.",
      "Austin said he would not speculate on what will happen, but he highlighted the role of diversity in the military and said it remains a meritocracy.",
      "\"We're a diverse nation, and we're going to remain a diverse nation. Our military is going to remain a diverse military,\" Austin said.",
      "Hegseth must still be confirmed by Senate, which will Republicans will control for the next two years, unless extraordinary circumstances like a recess appointment occur.",
      "Austin did not weigh in on what he thinks about Trump's choice of Hegseth.",
      "\u201cThe president-elect has the opportunity to nominate anyone that he chooses for any position, and certainly, you know, we respect that,\u201d Austin said.",
      "Trump has also said he could try to deploy the military to help with his plans to conduct mass deportations of people living in the U.S. without authorization. Asked in a Time magazine interview in April whether his plan included using the military, Trump responded that \"it would.\"",
      "Austin would not comment on what Trump's plans or intentions may be, but he said the law is \"well-defined\" in terms of \"how we employ our military, our armed forces.\"",
      "\"And I have faith and confidence in our senior leaders that they will always make the right decisions and make the right recommendations to their leadership,\" he said.",
      "On the Ukraine war, the outgoing Biden administration recently granted Ukraine permission to use U.S.-provided ATACMS, a type of ballistic missile system, inside Russia for limited strikes. Russian President\u00a0Vladimir Putin formally lowered the threshold for his country\u2019s use of nuclear weapons\u00a0Tuesday as the Defense Ministry announced that Ukraine had carried out its first strike on Russian territory using the U.S.-supplied long-range weapons.",
      "Austin said that as the war \u2014 which began when Russia launched a large-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 \u2014 has evolved, \"our approach to supporting them has also evolved over time.\"",
      "He said the U.S. has known for weeks that Russia was \"revamping\" its policy on using nuclear weapons, but he added that he did not see a \"change in their strategic force posture.\"",
      "\"We\u2019ll continue to remain vigilant in this regard. But at this point, no, I don\u2019t see an indication that there\u2019s an imminent intent to use nuclear weapons,\" he said.",
      "Austin also said that the U.S. military believes around 10,000 North Korean troops are in Russia's Kursk area, where Russia is preparing to try to retake land it has lost, but that it has not seen North Korean troops fighting alongside Russian troops yet.",
      "\"We believe that those troops will be embedded in Russian formations, and I have every reason to believe that we will see them in combat in the not-too-distant future,\" he said. \"I think the intent's there, but we've not seen that yet.\"",
      "Austin, a four-star general who was commander of U.S. Central Command, was appointed as defense secretary by President Joe Biden and was sworn in on Jan. 22, 2021."

    "story": [
      "Donald Trump's attorneys are demanding the judge who presided over his New York hush money trial and conviction immediately throw out the case, saying it would be \"uniquely destabilizing to the country\" otherwise.",
      "\"Immediate dismissal of this case is mandated by the federal Constitution, the Presidential Transition Act of 1963, and the interests of justice, in order to facilitate the orderly transition of Executive power following President Trump\u2019s overwhelming victory in the 2024 Presidential election,\" attorneys Todd Blanche and Emil Bove argued in a letter to state Judge Juan Merchan that was made public Wednesday.\u00a0The letter also cited presidential immunity as a reason to dismiss the case and maintained Trump is already protected by it.",
      "\"The Constitution forbids \u201cplac[ing] into the hands of a single prosecutor and grand jury the practical power to interfere with the ability of a popularly elected President to carry out his constitutional functions,\u201d the letter says, citing a memo from the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel, before it turned to the attorneys' own novel legal argument. \u00a0\"Just as a sitting President is completely immune from any criminal process, so too is President Trump as President-elect,\" the letter said.",
      "Blanche and Bove asked to have until Dec. 20 to file a motion laying out their reasoning for why the case should be dismissed, a timetable that would make it highly unlikely that Trump is sentenced before he takes office. They have argued he cannot be sentenced in office because it would interfere with his constitutional duties.",
      "Trump was convicted this year on 34 counts of falsifying business records related to a hush money payment to adult film actor Stormy Daniels. He was scheduled to be sentenced next Tuesday, but Merchan stayed all deadlines in the case last week after prosecutors said they needed time to consider how to proceed in light of Trump's election victory.",
      "In a letter to Merchan on Tuesday, prosecutors from Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg's office said they would not object to the sentencing\u2019s being postponed while Trump\u2019s lawyers file further legal arguments asking for the case to be dismissed.",
      "They said they would challenge efforts to toss out the case but agreed the situation is unprecedented.",
      "\u201cThe People deeply respect the Office of the President, are mindful of the demands and obligations of the presidency, and acknowledge that Defendant\u2019s inauguration will raise unprecedented legal questions,\" their filing said. \"We also deeply respect the fundamental role of the jury in our constitutional system.\"",
      "Merchan has not yet ruled."

    "published": "Wed, 20 Nov 2024 23:55:07 GMT",
    "summary": "The man accused of murdering four University of Idaho students two years ago may be punished with the death penalty if he is convicted, the trial judge has ruled.",
    "story": [
      "The man accused of murdering four University of Idaho students two years ago may be punished with the death penalty if he is convicted, the trial judge has ruled.",
      "At a hearing this month in Boise, Idaho, suspect Bryan Kohberger's defense team had tried to persuade District Court Judge Steven Hippler to block his trial, scheduled for August, from becoming a capital murder case.",
      "But Hippler found Kohberger's defense had failed in providing an alternative method of execution in Idaho to death by lethal injection or firing squad that is not \"unduly painful,\" Hippler said in his order Tuesday.",
      "\"Defendant must come forward with an alternative method,\" he concluded. \"He has not done so, thus foreclosing his claim.\"",
      "Idaho's alternative to the death penalty for a first-degree murder conviction is life in prison with at least 10 years served before a subject becomes eligible for parole.",
      "Prosecutors had said in court filings that there are four aggravating factors in the case against Kohberger, who turns 30 on Thursday, making the crime more severe and meriting the death penalty. They are that there are multiple victims; that the murders were \"especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel\"; that the suspect exhibited \"utter disregard for human life\"; and that the suspect has \"a propensity to commit murder which will probably constitute a continuing threat to society,\" according to the filing.",
      "A jury must concur that at least one aggravating factor pertains for a defendant to be sentenced to death. The jury must also unanimously agree to impose a death sentence.",
      "At the hearing, Idaho Deputy Attorney General Jeff\u00a0Nye\u00a0argued against the defense's claims that the death penalty is unconstitutional because it would be \"dehumanizing\" to have Kohberger sit on death row \"for years and years and years\" if the state does not have a viable method to administer an execution.",
      "\"You don't get to short-circuit the whole thing that death is off the table,\" Nye said, adding, \"That's not to say decades from now there's not going to be a method to put him to death.\"",
      "Idaho has not executed anyone since 2012 because it, like many other states, has had trouble procuring lethal injection drugs.",
      "However, Hippler noted at the hearing that the state did get the necessary drugs as it awaits to execute inmate Thomas Creech, who was convicted of five murders in three states and sentenced to death in 1983. His execution remains halted as he appeals after the state's attempt to execute him in February was abandoned when prison staff members failed to establish an IV line in the death chamber.",
      "An alternative method to lethal injection \u2014 death by firing squad \u2014 was signed into law last year, but a revamped chamber to allow for it has yet to be constructed.",
      "Anne Taylor, Kohberger's public defender, had also challenged the prosecution's claim that her client deserves the death penalty because he could pose a future danger to society \u2014 which, she contended, is vague because defendants are routinely accused of being dangerous.",
      "\"That can't be true when you sit in court day after day after day and you hear that about person after person after person,\" Taylor said. \"This statute doesn't do anything to help a jury decide who is the worst of the worst.\"",
      "A motive remains unclear in the killings of housemates Madison Mogen, 21, Kaylee Goncalves, 21, and Xana Kernodle, 20, and Kernodle's boyfriend, Ethan Chapin, 20, in November 2022.",
      "Kohberger was a resident of nearby Pullman, Washington, and then a doctoral student at Washington State University.",
      "While a\u00a0gag order\u00a0has prevented many involved in the case from speaking publicly, the prosecution has said it expects to present\u00a0at trial DNA evidence, details about Kohberger's cellphone use and security videos to connect him to the crime.",
      "Kohberger's defense has maintained that he often went on late-night drives and that\u00a0cellphone tower data would show\u00a0that he was doing so miles away when the four students were killed.",
      "In a filing this month, the defense asked the court to suppress evidence at trial, including DNA samples, it believes were improperly obtained by law enforcement and violated his constitutional rights.",
      "The trial has been moved to Boise from Latah County after the defense successfully argued there would be a strong possibility of bias among potential jurors and that the community does not have the resources for such highly anticipated proceedings.",
      "Steve Goncalves, Kaylee Goncalves\u2019 father, supported moving the trial and told NBC News before the judge's death penalty decision that he wanted to see Kohberger \"locked away and no longer influencing society.\"",
      "He said Kaylee was a \"very loving girl\" whose spirit has been missed."

    "story": [
      "A banana duct-taped to a white wall \u2014\u00a0or an acclaimed piece of art, depending how you look at it \u2014 sold at a Sotheby's auction for $6.24 million Wednesday.",
      "Maurizio Cattelan's \"Comedian\" is simply a banana stuck to the wall with a strip of silver duct tape exactly 160 centimeters from the floor.",
      "The artwork debuted at Art Basel Miami Beach in December 2019 and was initially estimated to sell for $1.5 million, according to Sotheby's.",
      "Art Basel quickly had to take the banana off the wall because of the crowds it drew, as it was prompting concern for the other featured artworks, art critic Nancy Durrant said in a Sotheby's video about the piece of art.",
      "It was the first art fair Cattelan was included in for 15 years, and it was the \"announcement as a new original work by Maurizio Cattelan that captured the world's attention immediately,\" said David Galperin, Sotheby\u2019s head of contemporary art for the Americas.",
      "At one point, someone even took the banana off the wall and ate it.",
      "Sotheby's said the work \"belongs to the rare league of artworks that need no introduction,\" as it \"quickly erupted into a viral global sensation that drew record crowds, social media inundation, landed the cover of The New York Post, and divided viewers and critics alike.\"",
      "\"Comedian\" has been \"passionately debated, rhapsodically venerated, and hotly contested,\" according to Sotheby's, as it made international headlines, \"becoming the most talked-about artwork of the century.\"",
      "The debut of \"Comedian\" caused commotion and true pandemonium, according to experts featured in the Sotheby's video about the artwork.",
      "It also made \"a lot of people very angry,\" Durrant said.",
      "The response to the banana blew up online, as news outlets debated \"whether this is art, whether it is a prank, whether it is a symbol of the excess of the art market,\" Lucius Elliot, head of contemporary marquee sales at Sotheby's, said in the video.",
      "He added: \"In truth, it is, of course, all of those things.\"",
      "Cattelan's sense of humor and use of comedy in his work \u2014 which set him apart as an artist, Durrant said \u2014 are clear in \"Comedian.\"",
      "Experts agreed that the artwork is meant to be funny, but they said it also pokes at some holes in the art world, like the concept that modern art can be absurd.",
      "For example, Cattelan \"is presenting a work that mocks the very notion of art having this degree of value,\" Elliot said, adding that while it is just a banana and duct tape, \"it's value is in its conceptual heft.\"",
      "\"The important thing to know about Maurizio is that his jokes are serious and his serious work is funny,\" Dodie Kazanjian, an editor for Vogue, said in the video, adding, \"There's something very deep in what Maurizio does, so the veneer of it might look like a banana, but there\u2019s something else always at the core of what he\u2019s saying.\"",
      "According to Sotheby's, Cattelan \"single-handedly prompted the world to reconsider how we define art, and the value we seek in it.\"",
      "Emmanuel Perrotin, founder of Perrotin, the gallery where \"Comedian\" was first shown, said he called a client the day before the banana's debut offering the client a chance to buy the artwork at an undisclosed price. The client turned him down, but three days later, Perrotin got a message from someone offering to buy \"Comedian\" for seven times the price he initially offered his client.",
      "\"Imagine the change of perception created by the way it was received by the audience,\" Perrotin said.",
      "As Galperin put it, \"There is no better forum to adjudicate the value of art and a single object than the platform of auction.\""

      "\u201cIt\u2019s bittersweet,\u201d the film\u2019s director, Joel Souza, said in an interview after the premiere. \u201cI think we would all have preferred that the movie was finished a long time ago, that Halyna was there standing proudly talking about it.\"",
      "On Oct. 21, 2021, \u201cRust\u201d cinematographer Halyna Hutchins was killed when Alec Baldwin\u2019s prop gun fired a live round of ammunition on set. The bullet also hit Souza in the shoulder.",

      "Baldwin was noticeably absent from the premiere, but Souza urged observers not to read too much into it.",
      "\u201cI doubt that [his attending] was ever even discussed. I mean, this is a cinematographers' film festival,\u201d he said.",
      "Also not attending were Hutchins\u2019 mother, father and sister, who stayed in their native Ukraine. In a statement on the eve of the premiere, the family said through their attorney, Gloria Allred, that they were boycotting the event because Baldwin never formally apologized. They also asserted that the producers are profiting from the tragedy.",
      "Baldwin\u2019s representative did not immediately respond to a request for comment. In a statement, Rust Movie Production pushed back against the family\u2019s statement.",
      "\u201cGloria Allred\u2019s misrepresentation of both the Camerimage festival and any profit motivation is disappointing,\u201d it said. \u201cThe decision to complete \u2018Rust\u2019 was made with the full support of Halyna\u2019s family.\u201d",
      "The film\u2019s new cinematographer, Bianca Cline, said the production team chose to finish the film in part to honor Hutchins\u2019 work.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s also awful that that\u2019s the only thing that the majority of the world knows Halyna for, and hopefully, via this film, people will know her as a cinematographer and how she sees the world, rather than just seeing what happened to her,\u201d she said.",
      "Hutchins\u2019 husband, Matthew Hutchins, received an undisclosed financial settlement from Baldwin and the film\u2019s producers and was an executive producer for the completed project.",
      "Souza said the producers hope to announce soon where moviegoers can watch the film for themselves."

They yelled, \u201cBow down, [N-word]!\u201d and other racist chants as they made their way through the state capital\u2019s Short North Arts District.",
      "\u201cTwo members were actually in the Short North area while that was happening and their prevailing feeling was fear,\u201d Holmes said. \u201cThere was a feeling of sadness. They\u2019re older \u2026 so it really harkened them back to a time they thought that the country had graduated from.\u201d",
      "President Joe Biden condemned the march, and White House spokesperson Andrew Bates said Nazism is \u201chostile to everything the United States stands for.\u201d Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine, Columbus Mayor Andrew Ginther and other city leaders condemned the neo-Nazis in statements and on social media.",
      "But Black locals like Holmes wanted to do more and send a message of solidarity, they said. The 100 Black Men of Central Ohio, a service organization that mentors young Black men, along with attorney Sean Walton Jr., Holmes and other locals, joined for the counter-rally Sunday afternoon.",
      "Dozens of men walked, many side by side, down North High Street, many dressed in all black. They were largely silent, sharing handshakes and smiles among one another. Brian Winston, president of 100 Black Men of Central Ohio, and Walton led the group, and they all posed together for photos with raised fists at the end of the march.",
      "\u201cIt was basically just bringing Black men together, to be able to allow our Black women, children and anyone else who were fearful or scared of what they saw \u2026 just to be able to redirect them with unity and love,\u201d Winston said, noting that he called on Walton to help organize the event.",
      "Walton said he was in Houston over the weekend and rushed home to check on his wife and children when he learned of the neo-Nazi march. He said the atmosphere among Black Columbus residents was one of fear and anxiety, with many wondering if they were safe in the city. But Sunday\u2019s march helped ease some of the despair, he said.",
      "\u201cI think there was a lot of focus on the fear,\u201d Walton said. \u201cWhat we did Sunday changed the tone of the entire weekend. If anything, this has made us stronger. I think it was a test, in a sense, when it comes to whether we can come together in the face of threats to our civil rights, our human rights and our way of life.\u201d",
      "In a statement posted Monday on social media, Columbus police said officers responded to calls about the neo-Nazi demonstration, but the \u201cavailable evidence did not support the filing of criminal charges.\u201d They said evidence showed pepper spray being deployed, but \u201cprobable cause has not been established to make any arrests.\u201d The incident is still under investigation, they said.",
      "The Columbus Division of Police did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Chief Elaine R. Bryant said in the statement that law enforcement was bound to protect constitutionally protected actions, \u201cno matter how hateful.\u201d She added: \u201cNo one in our community should experience intimidation or harassment. We will continue to strive to make Columbus a city where all residents feel welcome and safe.\u201d",
      "Holmes, Winston and Walton said the outcome of the presidential election and Donald Trump\u2019s rhetoric have encouraged neo-Nazi behavior. Earlier this month, protesters waved Nazi flags outside a community production of \u201cThe Diary of Anne Frank\u201d in Michigan, to the shock of performers and theatergoers.",
      "Far-right groups have made headlines in Ohio in recent months. A white nationalist activist in Springfield took credit for the false story that Haitian immigrants in the city were stealing and eating pets, which Trump repeated during the presidential debate and campaign rallies. Police said there was no evidence for the claim.",
      "Right-wing extremism has increased dramatically since 2016, according to research that has linked Trump\u2019s rhetoric about racial and ethnic minorities to vigilantism, hate crimes, and more. After the election, white nationalists, Proud Boys, Christian supremacists, and right-wing conspiracy theorists praised Trump\u2019s win and said they saw it as a victory for their far-right visions of America, according to the Washington Post. In 2017, Trump said there were \u201cvery fine people on both sides\u201d after a white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, which led to the death of a counterprotester.",
      "Trump has dismissed accusations that he has encouraged extremism or that his supporters include Nazi and fascists. \u201cPresident Trump is backed by Latinos, Black voters, union workers, angel moms, law enforcement officers, border patrol agents, and Americans of all faiths,\u201d his campaign press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, said in a statement last month.",
      "Oren Segal, vice president of the Anti-Defamation League Center on Extremism, told The New York Times that a St. Louis-based group called Hate Club took credit for the Columbus march.",
      "Jon Lewis, a research fellow at George Washington University\u2019s Program on Extremism, said in an interview that these groups may have different names, but share white nationalist ideologies.",
      "\u201cI think \u2018emboldening\u2019 is the perfect way to describe it,\u201d Lewis said. \u201cNeo-Nazis and white supremacists increasingly feel as though they can act with impunity, that they can mobilize to the streets of towns and cities across the country to incite hatred, to spread fear among primarily nonwhite communities.",
      "\u201cAt the end of the day, this is about fearmongering and hate-mongering. These groups are designed to make the average nonwhite American feel unsafe in their everyday lives.\u201d"

      "A homeless Florida man was arrested Wednesday and charged with plotting to bomb the New York Stock Exchange to force a \"reboot\" or \"reset\" of the U.S. government, according to a criminal complaint.",
      "Harun Abdul-Malik Yener came under FBI scrutiny in February after agents received a tip that he was storing bomb-making schematics in a storage unit in Coral Springs, the complaint says.",
      "After they got Yener's permission, FBI agents searched the storage unit in early March and found spiral-bound notebooks with drawings of land mines, explosives, missiles and other improvised explosive devices, according to the complaint.",
      "Yener told agents at the time that he was creating \u201crockets\u201d with very \u201cvolatile\u201d chemical mixtures that would explode if they were mixed incorrectly, the complaint says. He also claimed he was recruited over Facebook Messenger to join ISIS overseas but ultimately decided against it because he believed the terrorist group would not succeed in achieving its objectives, the complaint says.",
      "Near the end of the interview, it says, he told the FBI agents he was waiting for the right moment to take action within the U.S. \u201cI am just waiting for some kind of hole to open up and I can go, ah, there it is\u2014I\u2019ll know it when I see\u00a0it,\u201d he said, according to the complaint.",
      "Armed with a search warrant, agents returned to the unit a few days later and discovered \u201cbombmaking\u00a0sketches, numerous watches with timers, electronic circuit boards, and other electronics\" that \"could be used for constructing explosive devices,\" the complaint says.",
      "Undercover FBI agents later made contact with Yener and convinced him they wanted to help him carry out an attack, it says. They tracked Yener throughout the summer and into the fall.",
      "In October, he asked an undercover agent to drive him to a Walmart, where he picked up items and tools \u2014 including a soldering iron and a multimeter voltage reader \u2014 that he needed to construct an improvised explosive device, the complaint says. Afterward, he told the undercover agent that he settled on the New York Stock Exchange as the location where he would detonate the IED, according to the complaint.",
      "\u201cThere is one place that would be hella easy...the stock exchange, that would be a great hit,\" Yener said, according to the complaint. \"Tons of people would support it. They would see it and think dude, this guy makes sense, they are...robbing us. So that\u2019s perfect.\u201d",
      "Days later, he told a group of undercover FBI agents that he wanted to bomb the stock exchange the week before Thanksgiving. He also said he wanted to send a statement to a news station that would explain his motivation and objectives, the complaint says.",
      "On Nov. 12, he made a series of audio recordings with the help of an FBI undercover agent and said he wanted to send them to NBC News either the day of the bombing or the day after, the complaint says.",
      "\u201cWhat you\u2019ve just witnessed at the Stock Exchange...was just the beginning of a new era. A new revolution,\" he said on one of the recordings, according to the complaint.",
      "\"We ask and encourage others to follow suit in their pursuit for change,\" he added, it says.",
      "Yener was charged with the attempted use of an explosive to damage or destroy any building used in interstate or foreign commerce.\u00a0It was not immediately clear whether he had a lawyer.",
      "His arrest was first reported by Seamus Hughes of Court Watch."

      "Head, 46, had gone to his ranch\u00a0in Maydelle, Texas, by himself on Thursday. The next day, following a solo hunting trip, he was loading his Jeep when his .22-caliber revolver suddenly went off.",
      "\u201cI wanted to come on and tell you guys that I'm still alive thankfully, thanks to the good Lord above, and the wonderful first responders that helped me as well as the trauma team at UT Tyler,\u201d Head said in a series of videos on Facebook this week.",

      "Three giraffe subspecies should be added to the endangered species list, U.S. officials said Wednesday, as their populations continue a yearslong trend of decline.",
      "The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service proposed that the West African, Kordofan and Nubian subspecies of northern giraffe be considered endangered under the Endangered Species Act. In addition, the service proposed listing the reticulated giraffe and the Masai giraffe as threatened.",
      "\u201cFederal protections for giraffes will help protect a vulnerable species, foster biodiversity, support ecosystem health, combat wildlife trafficking, and promote sustainable economic practices,\u201d Fish and Wildlife Service Director Martha Williams said in a statement. \u201cThis action supports giraffe conservation while ensuring the United States does not contribute further to their decline.\u201d",
      "The Endangered Species Act, enacted in 1973, \u201cestablishes protections for fish, wildlife, and plants that are listed as threatened or endangered,\u201d according to the agency.",
      "Giraffe populations are in decline because of poaching, habitat loss and climate change, according to the Fish and Wildlife Service. Other primary threats include human population growth and fragmentation and degradation caused by urbanization, officials said.",
      "The proposed listing would help the animals by reducing illegal hunting and trade by requiring permits to import giraffes into the U.S., the Fish and Wildlife Service said.",
      "Trade with the U.S. is not the main threat to the declining giraffe population, Fish and Wildlife Service officials said, but it is a contributing factor. In addition, giraffes' hair and tails and their \"use in traditional medicine\" make them valuable. More recently, giraffes have been targeted by hunters and poachers for bushmeat.",
      "Listing giraffes as endangered would also increase funding for conservation in their range countries, boost funding for research efforts to address conservation and give limited financial assistance to conservation programs, officials said.",
      "Since 1985, the population of West African, Kordofan and Nubian giraffes has declined by about 77% \u2014 from over 25,000 animals to just under 6,000, according to the Fish and Wildlife Service. There are only 690 West African giraffes remaining, officials said.",
      "The vast majority of the reticulated giraffe population \u2014 about 15,985 animals \u2014 are in Kenya, the Fish and Wildlife Service said. There are around 45,400 Masai giraffes, roughly 67% of their total population in the 1970s.",
      "Giraffes, the tallest living terrestrial animals, spend much of their time feeding on leaves, stems, flowers and fruit, the Fish and Wildlife Service said. The animals are versatile and can adapt to a number of habitats, but they are most often found in savannas and woodland habitats, always near trees or bushes.",
      "The proposal to list the giraffe subspecies as endangered is open for public comment for 90 days."

      "At the time, she added, \u201cIt isn\u2019t a black-and-white issue. I do believe that religious liberty, the First Amendment, gay rights, and transgender equality can all coexist. I\u2019m also a constitutionalist, and we have to ensure anti-discrimination laws don\u2019t violate First Amendment rights or religious freedom.\u201d",

      "\u201cIf you think protecting women is discrimination, you are the problem. We don\u2019t care if you\u2019re trans,\u201d she said, before she made a crude remark about genitalia and who belongs in a women\u2019s bathroom.",
      "Since Mace introduced her resolution, Democrats have resoundingly rebuked her and GOP leaders.",

      "The changes are just one part of a massive, 131-page bill that includes hurricane relief funding and would advance a spate of other Republican legislative priorities. The law was written behind closed doors and introduced as a committee substitute Tuesday morning, replacing a long-discarded bill about dental practices.",
      "Both GOP-controlled chambers passed it over just two days, though three Republicans opposed the measure in the House on Tuesday. After the Senate passed the bill Wednesday, it heads to the desk of Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper, who has criticized the measure as a \"power grab.\"",
      "\u201cState Board staff were not consulted about this significant piece of legislation that transfers authority of the State Board of Elections and makes substantial administrative changes that may make it impossible for the county boards of elections to adequately ensure every eligible ballot cast is counted, especially in high turnout elections,\u201d Karen Brinson Bell, the executive director of the State Board of Elections, said in a statement.",
      "After Wednesday's vote, Senate Republican Phil Berger defended the bill, saying it was \u201call within the rules that we have,\" according to the Raleigh News & Observer.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve expressed concerns for a number of years about how the Board of Elections has been operating under the appointees of Roy Cooper,\" Berger said. \"And we have tried on multiple occasions to put forward the idea that we need to have balance on the board that is responsible for counting votes, and making decisions about elections. The Democrats have said, no, no, no, hell no. And so we just decided that it was time for us to go ahead and take action.\u201d",
      "North Carolina's elections board is currently split 3-2 in favor of Democrats.",
      "The legislation also proposes prohibiting the attorney general, an office Democrats also kept control of in this month's election, from taking legal positions contrary to those of the Legislature. That would prevent the state\u2019s incoming attorney general, Jeff Jackson, from refusing to defend laws the Legislature has passed, as Stein did with the state's new abortion law last year.",
      "The new bill would also strip the governor of some of his power in filling judicial vacancies and creating new Superior Court positions nominated by legislative leaders.",
      "Republicans are on track to lose their supermajority in the Legislature pending the result of a recount in a state House race, in which the Democrat currently leads in the GOP-held district. That means they would be unable to override any future vetoes from Stein without Democratic support.",
      "Stein is succeeding Cooper, whose administration repeatedly clashed with the Republican-led Legislature in the battleground state.",
      "\"Many people and communities are hurting and need our help,\" Stein said in a post on X on Tuesday. \"But instead of stepping up, the Republicans in the General Assembly are grabbing power and exacting political retribution.\""

    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 The Senate voted overwhelmingly Wednesday night to reject three efforts led by progressive Sen. Bernie Sanders that would have blocked certain offensive weapons sales to Israel.",
      "The resolutions got bipartisan opposition and had not been expected to pass.",
      "Sanders, I-Vt., sponsored three separate resolutions that zeroed in on different types of weapons: tank rounds, mortar rounds and a type of guidance kit that is often attached to bombs dropped in Gaza. The resolutions failed, with 78, 79 and 80 senators voting against the three separate attempts.",
      "Sanders said on X before the vote that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu \"has violated international & U.S. law, violating human rights and blocking humanitarian aid.\"",
      "In a speech on the Senate floor ahead of the vote, Sanders argued that the resolutions \"would not affect any of the systems Israel uses to defend itself from incoming attacks,\" focusing instead on offensive weapons.",
      "\"As I have said many, many times: Israel had the absolute right to respond to that horrific Hamas attack, as any other country would. I don\u2019t think anybody here in the United States Senate disagrees with that,\" he said in his floor speech. \"But Prime Minister Netanyahu\u2019s extremist government has not simply waged war against Hamas. It has waged an all-out war against the Palestinian people.\"",
      "Sen. Ed Markey, D-Mass., voted in favor of the resolutions, saying in a statement that \"the U.S. strategy of giving the Netanyahu government a blank check for offensive weapons cannot continue.\"",
      "\"No nation, not even a close ally such as Israel, is entitled to military assistance from the United States without following U.S. and international law,\" he added.",
      "Sen. Martin Heinrich, D-N.M., also voted for the resolutions, saying in a statement that de-escalating the war \"cannot happen if we look the other way when it comes to how specific weapons are used and their extraordinary toll.\"",
      "Sen. Tammy Baldwin, D-Wis., was the only senator to vote \u201cpresent\u201d on each resolution. She said in a statement that \u201cthese resolutions are not the solution.\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019m abstaining because neither a \u2018yes\u2019 nor \u2018no\u2019 vote captures my goals of both supporting Israel\u2019s right to defend themself and protecting the lives of innocent Palestinians,\u201d the statement continued.",
      "Other Democrats touted their votes against the resolutions.",
      "Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto, D-Nev., said on X that she \u201cwill always stand proudly to support our strongest ally.\u201d",
      "Sen. Jacky Rosen, D-Nev., similarly said in on X that \u201cIsrael is our ally in the Middle East & we must do everything we can to help it defend itself.\u201d",
      "Every Republican present for the vote also voted against the resolutions.",
      "\"While Israel is being attacked on all fronts, it should not be under attack in the halls of Congress,\" Sen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, said on X.",
      "\"Limiting Israel\u2019s ability to defend itself helps its enemies,\" Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., said in another post on X.",
      "During the presidential campaign, anti-war progressives routinely criticized the Biden administration's handling of the war, pushing for an end to the conflict and slamming the White House's alliance with Israel and Netanyahu.",
      "Israel\u2019s government, led by Netanyahu, has ardently argued that it must destroy Hamas to prevent an attack similar to the terrorist attack on Oct. 7, 2023, when about 1,200 people in Israel were killed and 251 were kidnapped.",
      "More than 43,000 Palestinians have been killed in Israel\u2019s offensive into the dense enclave since the attack, according to health officials in Gaza. The death toll statistics do not distinguish between Hamas combatants and civilians, but health officials say more than half of those killed are women and children."

    "published": "Wed, 20 Nov 2024 21:02:15 GMT",
    "summary": "The two former Georgia election workers who won an almost $150 million defamation judgment against former Donald Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani want him held in civil contempt for continuing to falsely accuse them of having committed election fraud in the 2020 election.",
    "story": [
      "The two former Georgia election workers who won an almost $150 million defamation judgment against former Donald Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani want him held in civil contempt for continuing to falsely accuse them of having committed election fraud in the 2020 election.",
      "In papers filed in federal court in Washington, D.C., attorneys for Ruby Freeman and Shaye Moss say Giuliani has continued to make false claims about them online despite a court-approved deal in May in which he \"agreed to be bound by a permanent injunction prohibiting him from repeating the same or similar statements to the statements adjudged to be false and defamatory.\"",
      "\"It took only six months for Mr. Giuliani to resume his defamatory campaign\" against the mother and daughter, the filing said, including making false claims about them on his livestreamed \"America's Mayor Live\" show this month. Among his comments were that they \"quadruple\"-counted votes and used \"hard drives\" to \"fix the machines,\" according to the filing.",
      "The filing said the claims are \"unambiguous violations of the Consent Injunction, and the Court should hold him in civil contempt.\" The pair are seeking an unspecified amount in fines for the violations and for Giuliani to be put on notice that he will be fined for any future violations.",
      "\"Fixing the appropriate sanction \u2014 particularly fixing an amount sufficiently 'calibrated' to coerce Giuliani\u2019s compliance with the Consent Injunction, in light of his demonstrated willingness to repeatedly violate court orders \u2014 may require factfinding by this Court after an evidentiary hearing,\" the filing said.",
      "A representative for Giuliani, Ted Goodman, called the motion \"a dishonest and duplicitous attack meant to deprive Mayor Rudy Giuliani of his First Amendment right to freedom of speech.\"",
      "\"The ongoing lawfare against Mayor Giuliani must end,\" he said in a statement.",
      "U.S. District Judge Beryl Howell ordered Giuliani to respond to the motion by Dec. 2 and to appear at a Dec. 12 hearing on the issue. She also cautioned Giuliani that if he doesn\u2019t file a response when he\u2019s supposed to, it \u201cwill be treated as conceding that motion.\u201d",
      "Howell found Giuliani liable for defaming Freeman and Moss after he repeatedly snubbed court orders to turn over required evidence to the pair, who had sued him over his claims about them in his efforts to overturn the 2020 election results on Trump's behalf. They said the false accusations forced them out of their jobs and led to a torrent of racist death threats.",
      "A jury awarded them $148 million after a damages trial last year. A judge later reduced the award, which Giuliani is appealing, to $146 million.",
      "Giuliani filed for bankruptcy protection afterward, but that case was dismissed after he repeatedly failed to turn over required financial information.",
      "Freeman and Moss sued in New York looking to enforce their judgment this year, and their attorneys accused Giuliani of slow-walking the surrender of his assets and again failing to turn over necessary filing information. Giuliani began surrendering at least some of his assets in the past week, including luxury watches and a 1980 Mercedes-Benz that once belonged to Hollywood legend Lauren Bacall, according to court filings.",
      "One of the workers' attorneys, Aaron Nathan, told U.S. District Judge Lewis Liman that Giuliani had surreptitiously cleaned out items from his New York apartment that were supposed to be handed over to his client and sent them to a storage facility. The attorneys said that they are reviewing the contents of the storage facility but that there are still assets Giuliani hasn't turned over.",
      "\"Plaintiff has not turned over any cash, and does not appear to have any intention of turning over any cash beyond a few thousand dollars in one account,\" they said in a court filing this week.",
      "Giuliani is challenging their claim to a limited number of items, including his Florida condominium unit and his New York Yankees World Series rings, which he says he gave to his son as a gift. Those challenges will be the subject of what's expected to be a brief trial starting Jan. 16, but Giuliani is seeking to have the date pushed back because of unspecified \"inauguration events\" ahead of Trump's Jan. 20 inauguration.",
      "Moss and Freeman's attorneys urged the judge to stick with the current trial date, which was set last month. \"Mr. Giuliani\u2019s preference for attending an event three days prior to the inauguration itself does not remotely constitute good cause to adjourn this trial,\" they wrote."

So it was very important to never give false clues because in the end, you see how it all comes together and makes sense. Catherine is telling everything with her behavior,\u201d he adds.",
      "Read on to see how \u201cDisclaimer\u201d ends.",
      "Is the story about Jonathan's death true?",
      "Not quite.",
      "At the beginning of \u201cDisclaimer,\u201d the audience learns about Jonathan\u2019s death in \u201cThe Perfect Stranger,\u201d the book his mother, Nancy, wrote about his life \u2014 but it doesn\u2019t tell the real story.",
      "In the book, Nancy says that Jonathan had an affair with Catherine, an older woman, after she enticed him during her family vacation to Italy. Their rigorous night of lovemaking is preserved through explicit pictures that Jonathan took of Catherine that night. The next day, Jonathan dies rescuing Catherine\u2019s 5-year-old son, Nicholas, from drowning.",
      "Jonathan, according to the book, wants to follow Catherine home to London and be with her romantically. His girlfriend had gone home early due to an emergency and he is entranced with Catherine. Catherine, meanwhile, is less enthused \u2014 and in the drowning, she sees an opportunity to solve her problem.",
      "Though Catherine sees Jonathan struggling in the waves, she decides not to tell any of the bystanders who flocked to the beach to save Nicholas. By the time someone notices Jonathan in the water, it is already too late. He is declared dead on the scene. Nicholas is safely brought back to shore by two onlookers nearby.",
      "Once Nancy hears about Jonathan\u2019s death, she becomes obsessed with learning how her son truly died. Nancy gives up anything that used to bring her joy and spends her time hiding away in her late son\u2019s bedroom, where she ultimately writes \u201cThe Perfect Stranger.\u201d",
      "Did Nancy know about Jonathan's violent nature?",
      "Seeing that Nancy died long before the events unfolded in \u201cDisclaimer,\u201d it\u2019s hard to know exactly how much she knew about her son.",
      "However, it is clear that Nancy chose to only believe certain parts of Jonathan\u2019s life. As a mother, she was enamored by her son and appeared to be taken aback once she learned why Jonathan\u2019s girlfriend, Sasha, left him alone on vacation in Italy and returned home to London just days before he died.",
      "In \u201cDisclaimer,\u201d Nancy receives a phone call from Sasha\u2019s mother, Emma, after her daughter has already returned home aggravated. In the call, she\u2019s told that Sasha and Jonathan had some kind of falling out.",
      "When Emma gives Nancy more details, Nancy appears to lose her patience and says, \u201cWell, I think it\u2019s up to them to sort out their differences. Let\u2019s not aggrandize things here, Emma. We don\u2019t know what went on down there.\u201d",

      "Nancy even goes as far as to say that Sasha has been \u201cexaggerating\u201d about her and Jonathan\u2019s split and what she told her mother is \u201cnonsense\u201d that sounds \u201cvery extreme.\u201d",
      "Although the show does not share what Emma said on the phone, it\u2019s clear that Nancy knew her son might be dangerous to some degree and she chose to ignore the signs.",
      "When Stephen asks Nancy about the phone call, Nancy simply tells him that Emma said their kids had an argument and that\u2019s why they are no longer together. Without questioning it, Stephen believes Nancy and then calls Sasha \u201ca mess,\u201d which Cuar\u00f3n says further demonstrates the show\u2019s message that you should \u201cbeware of narrative and form.\u201d",
      "Cuar\u00f3n explains that Stephen is a \u201cvery weak person\u201d who has been \u201cundermined\u201d by Nancy and Jonathan and that\u2019s why he was \u201cin denial\u201d for so long.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s just afraid to confront anything, and he just takes Nancy\u2019s point of view as his own. So, he was in denial,\u201d Cuar\u00f3n explains. \u201cIt\u2019s true that we don\u2019t want to think those things of our children, but when it comes to Stephen, he is completely submissive to his wife\u2019s version of reality.\u201d",
      "As for whether or not Nancy knew about Jonathan\u2019s violent nature? Cuar\u00f3n says, \u201cI would almost be certain of that.\u201d",
      "\u201cIn many ways, Nancy\u2019s impulse to write \u2018The Perfect Stranger\u2019 was a way for her to protect her son and change the narrative of her son,\u201d he explained. \u201cThanks to the book, she could turn her son into this naive, heroic, romantic figure, which is very different from the reality.\u201d",
      "Does Nicholas die?",
      "At the beginning of \u201cDisclaimer,\u201d Stephen makes it clear that he published his wife\u2019s book, \u201cThe Perfect Stranger,\u201d simply to torture Catherine. He wants her closest friends and family members to know the part that she played in Jonathan\u2019s death.",
      "Stephen creates a complicated catfishing scheme to tell Nicholas his role in the story. Distraught by his mother\u2019s representation in the novel, Nicholas overdoses and ends up unconscious in the hospital.",
      "Once in the hospital, Stephen tries to kill Nicholas by injecting him with an unknown substance. However, Catherine stops him just in time.",
      "He then tries again once he spikes Catherine\u2019s tea, which puts her into a deep slumber. At the hospital, Stephen tries to give Nicholas the deadly injection, but he stops once he sympathizes with a confused Nicholas, who is calling out for his mom.",
      "What does Stephen see in the photograph?",
      "After the truth comes out about Jonathan, Stephen then decides to burn all the explicit photos that his son took of Catherine on the night he raped her.",
      "As he places the photos into the fire, Stephen sees a small but important detail he missed \u2014 Nicholas was there in the room when Catherine got assaulted.",
      "A photograph shows a young Nicholas looking on at his mother from the reflection in the mirror. It\u2019s at that moment that Stephen realizes his journey for retribution hurt more people than he realized.",
      "\u201cRevenge and retribution are just going to end up in the same way because it\u2019s just like the saying \u2014 \u2018He who seeks revenge should dig two graves,\u2019\u201d Cuar\u00f3n says.",
      "At the end of the show, Catherine opens up to Nicholas about what happened to her in Italy. Nicholas starts crying and says he doesn\u2019t remember the trip or that she was raped. While feeling remorseful, he hugs his mother and they both take the opportunity to get to know one another better on a clean slate.",
      "\u201cVery often, we don\u2019t remember traumatic episodes that we witness. But the fact that we don\u2019t remember them doesn\u2019t mean that they are not stored inside us and come out in different behaviors. This is shown with Nicholas and his addictive behaviors,\u201d Cuar\u00f3n says.",
      "\u201cDisclaimer\u201d ends with Catherine rebuilding her bond with her son. After putting her career first for many years, she decides to focus on Nicholas and mending their once strained relationship."

    "story": [
      "Fifty years after the\u00a0Manson\u00a0Family killings, the name Charles\u00a0Manson\u00a0still evokes a strong image \u2014 that of a shaggy-haired cult leader who spoke provocatively about mass murder.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no need to feel guilty. I haven\u2019t done anything I\u2019m ashamed of. Maybe I haven\u2019t done enough,\u201d\u00a0Manson said in a\u00a01987 interview with TODAY\u00a0at California\u2019s San Quentin prison. \u201cMaybe I should have killed four, five hundred people, then I would have felt better. Then I would have felt like I really offered society something.\u201d",
      "Manson, whose followers committed a series of brutal killings in the late 1960s, is known for his infamous crimes. What\u2019s less known is who\u00a0Manson\u00a0was behind the scenes, when he was not being interviewed or making erratic outbursts in the courtroom.",
      "A new Peacock docuseries, \u201cMaking\u00a0Manson,\u201d out Nov. 19, features 20 years of never-before-heard recordings of\u00a0Manson\u2019s private phone conversations from prison. Peacock is owned by TODAY\u2019s parent company, NBCUniversal.",
      "More than 100 hours of audio recordings were provided by John Michael Jones, a man who says he first wrote to\u00a0Manson\u00a0in an effort to get his signature, then struck up a decadeslong relationship with him,\u00a0according to his interview in the documentary.\u00a0They stayed in touch until\u00a0Manson\u2019s death in 2017.",
      "These recordings \u201cgave us a candid conversation that we\u2019ve never seen. We\u2019ve never seen\u00a0Manson\u00a0without the mask before,\u201d the documentary\u2019s director, Billie Mintz, tells\u00a0TODAY.com.",
      "Mintz says the documentary, which also features several interviews with former members of\u00a0Manson\u2019s circle, is not meant to exonerate\u00a0Manson, but to add dimension and context to the widely accepted narrative about him. The documentary also includes the perspective of a forensic psychologist who analyzes\u00a0Manson\u2019s tapes.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not saying that I have sympathy for\u00a0Manson,\u201d Mintz says, \u201cbut by humanizing him, we understand a lot more of what led to these tragic events, and we learned a lot more about ourselves.\u201d",
      "Read on to learn more about Charles\u00a0Manson, and what is revealed in \u201cMaking\u00a0Manson.\u201d",
      "Who was Charles Manson?",
      "Charles\u00a0Manson\u00a0was a cult leader who was convicted in murder in 1971\u00a0after his\u00a0supporters committed a series of violent murders under his influence.",
      "Manson\u2019s followers, many of whom were teenage girls drawn to communal living and other 1960s counterculture ideals, have opened up about how he exerted power over them.",
      "\u201cHe was always needing to be in control, and that came from having all control taken from him at a very young age, and being helpless,\u201d former follower Catherine Share says in the documentary.",
      "Share was not involved in the Tate-LaBianca murders but served five years for involvement in a\u00a0Manson\u00a0Family robbery and later served a sentence for participating in a credit card scheme,\u00a0per AP.",
      "\u201cAnd a man does not want to be helpless, and he\u2019ll do anything not to feel that way again. He tried love for a while. He said, \u2018Oh, that worked.\u2019 And he said, \u2018But fear is stronger.\u2019\u201d",
      "Manson\u00a0had a troubled upbringing full of trauma and abandonment, per\u00a0NBC News, and he had frequent run-ins with the law from a young age. By the time he was 32 and released from a 10-year prison term in 1967, he had spent half his life in prison, Vincent Bugliosi \u2014 a true crime author and the prosecutor at\u00a0Manson\u2019s trial for the Tate-LaBianca Murder \u2014 estimates in \u201cHelter Skelter,\u201d a definitive book about\u00a0Manson. After his release, he moved to San Francisco and began attracting members of a group he called the Family. Members of the Family would go on to commit murders at\u00a0Manson\u2019s ordering.",
      "In April 1971,\u00a0Manson\u00a0was convicted on seven counts of first-degree murder, as well as one count of conspiracy to commit murder, for the deaths of seven people in what is often referred to as the Tate-LaBianca murders.",
      "Members of\u00a0Manson\u2019s followers killed five people during the Tate murders, which took place on Aug. 9, 1969.",
      "Actor Sharon Tate Polanski, the wife of director Roman Polanski, was one of the people killed during a gathering at her home. She had been 8 months pregnant. Also murdered were hair stylist Jay Sebring, Folger coffee heiress Abigail Folger and her boyfriend, writer Wojciech Frykowski and Steven Parent, who was visiting the caretaker of the Polanskis\u2019 guest house.",
      "The next day on Aug. 10,\u00a0Manson\u2019s followers murdered two more people, Leno LaBianca and his wife, Rosemary LaBianca, at their home in Los Angeles, per the Associated Press.",
      "While\u00a0Manson\u00a0was not physically present for any of these murders, prosecutors argued he held responsibility for the killings because he had known about the planned violence and had been closely involved in directing his followers to commit murder.",
      "\u201cThe prosecution\u2019s thesis was that\u00a0Manson\u00a0was vicariously liable for the acts of all the co-indictees,\u201d according to a\u00a01976 opinion\u00a0issued in the Court of Appeals of California. \u201cIf the jury believed\u00a0Manson\u00a0to be a conspirator, aider or abettor he was culpable for all of the homicides regardless of who held the knife.\u201d",
      "Manson\u00a0spoke to his role in the murders in the documentary. \u201cI never said I was innocent. I said I didn\u2019t break the law,\u201d he said.",
      "In March 1971,\u00a0Manson\u00a0and three of his followers, Susan Atkins, Patricia Krenwinkel and Leslie Van Houten, were sentenced to death for their roles in the Tate-LaBianca killings,\u00a0NBC News reported in his obit. Van Houten was charged in conspiracy for all the killings but for murder only in the LaBianca killings. Tex Watson was also sentenced to death later that year, the\u00a0New York Times reported\u00a0in 1971.",
      "In December 1971,\u00a0Manson\u00a0received two further first-degree murder convictions for the July 1969 death of musician Gary Hinman, per\u00a0NBC News, and the August 1969 death of stuntman and actor Donald Shea, per\u00a0NBC News.",
      "Bobby Beausoleil was convicted in the killing of Hinman in 1970 and remains in prison, according to the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation.",
      "In 1971,\u00a0Manson\u00a0devotee Bruce Davis was convicted in the killing of Hinman and Shea, and he remains in prison, according to the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation. Steve Grogan was also convicted in Shea\u2019s killing and was released on parole in 1985 after revealing the location of Shea\u2019s body, per\u00a0the L.A. Times.",
      "The following year,\u00a0Manson\u00a0and his followers\u2019 sentences were commuted to life in prison after California abolished the death penalty in 1972.",
      "Manson\u00a0remained incarcerated for the rest of his life. He died at 83 from natural causes on Nov. 19, 2017, at a hospital in Kern County, California, according to the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation.",
      "Atkins, convicted on seven counts of first-degree murder, died in prison of cancer in 2009,\u00a0NBC News reported. Watson and Krenwinkel, both convicted on seven counts of first-degree murder, remain in prison, per the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation. Van Houten, convicted on two counts of first-degree murder, was freed on parole in 2023,\u00a0NBC News reported.",
      "What is revealed in the Peacock documentary about\u00a0Manson?",
      "The \u201cMaking\u00a0Manson\u201d docuseries features never-before-heard audio recordings of\u00a0Manson\u00a0discussing his childhood, his followers and his criminal convictions.",
      "In one recording,\u00a0Manson\u00a0claims that he murdered multiple people in Mexico.",
      "\u201cSee, there\u2019s a whole part of my life that nobody knows about,\u201d he tells Jones in the tape. \u201cI lived in Mexico for a while. I went to Acapulco, stole some cars. I just got involved in stuff over my head, man \u2026 got involved in a couple of killings. I left my .357 Magnum in Mexico City, and I left some dead people on the beach.\u201d",
      "He also argues that he was not responsible for the murders his followers committed and accuses the media of twisting his story.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the media. The media that starts selling that. They didn\u2019t want to hear the truth. They wanted that hippie cult leader thing, man,\u201d he says in one recording. \u201cThey didn\u2019t give a f--- whether I did it or whether I didn\u2019t do it. They wanted that vicarious thrill.\u201d",
      "Jones says in the documentary that he resonated with\u00a0Manson\u2019s difficult childhood experiences and describes building up a trusting relationship with\u00a0Manson\u00a0over the years.",
      "\u201cHe found somebody he could be vulnerable to. I think that\u2019s why Charlie gave me a lot of what we have on these tapes. And I think the longer I spent getting to know him, slowly that mask began to peel off,\u201d he says.",
      "Director Billie Mintz says it\u2019s possible that\u00a0Manson\u00a0was lying at times on the tapes and attempting to manipulate Jones.",
      "\u201cI think that for sure,\u00a0Manson\u00a0wanted (Jones) to like him, and (Jones) wanted to like\u00a0Manson,\u201d Mintz says. \u201cSo I think there\u2019s manipulation, but from listening to these stories, (Manson) didn\u2019t have any reason to. He didn\u2019t want to get out of prison. He wasn\u2019t trying to exonerate himself. He literally says, \u2018I\u2019m a bad guy. I should be in prison, but I shouldn\u2019t be in prison for this.\u2019\u201d",
      "Mintz says the documentary places the tapes in context by interviewing a wide range of\u00a0Manson\u00a0experts and former followers to create \u201cdiscourse where there was no discourse before.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t say we know the truth, but maybe we give you a more nuanced, closer version of the story to the truth than you might\u2019ve had before,\u201d he says.",
      "\u200b\u200bThe documentary features interviews with multiple former members of the Family, including Dianne Lake, who was 14 when she met\u00a0Manson.\u00a0She wrote in her memoir \u201cMember of the Family\u201d\u00a0that\u00a0she did not participate in the Tate-LaBianca murders, and in fact testified against\u00a0Manson\u00a0and other members of the Family during the murder trial.",
      "Lake, who was known by the nickname \u201cSnake\u201d in the Family, describes how\u00a0Manson\u00a0allegedly treated his female followers.",
      "\u201cHe definitely used us and he definitely abused us,\u201d she says. \u201cI got hit and beat and raped, once, and I think the other girls probably did, too, but they kept it a secret.\u201d",
      "Share, another former\u00a0Manson\u00a0associate, recalls\u00a0Manson\u00a0turning \u201cabsolutely dark and electrified and menacing.\u201d",
      "The documentary also features interviews with\u00a0Manson\u2019s former cellmate and family members of the Family\u2019s victims, as well as interviews with an investigative reporter, a forensic psychologist and a former FBI special agent and criminologist.",
      "Near the end of the documentary, Jones defends his relationship with\u00a0Manson.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not a fanboy. I\u2019m a f------ human being with a heart who happened to befriend somebody that I didn\u2019t expect to,\u201d he says.",

      "If the Kremlin was hoping to instill fear among its Western foes by lowering the bar for its use of nuclear weapons, then it may have been disappointed Wednesday.",
      "Russian President Vladimir Putin's broadened nuclear doctrine appeared to be a thinly veiled threat to the United States and its allies over their ramped-up support for Ukraine.",
      "The updated document includes a change that allows for Moscow to launch a nuclear strike if attacked by a nonnuclear country, such as Ukraine, that is supported by a nuclear state, such as the U.S.\u00a0It was formally approved the same day that Kyiv used its first U.S.-supplied long-range ATACMS missiles against Russia.",
      "But while the chances of Putin deploying a devastating nuclear weapon in his war with Ukraine are never nil, world leaders and analysts alike expressed doubts that the change amounted to much more than a new and more intense effort to deter the West.",

    "story": [
      "TEL AVIV \u2014 Israeli prosecutors have accused one of Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s aides of illegally leaking classified intelligence in an attempt to blunt widespread criticism of the prime minister\u2019s handling of the Gaza hostage crisis.",
      "The allegations, detailed in newly released court filings, are part of a sprawling criminal probe that has rocked Israel\u2019s government and led to the aide\u2019s arrest and detention in prison. Four military personnel have also been arrested in connection with the case.",
      "Investigators discovered that a low-level Israeli soldier had illegally removed Hamas documents from a military database and passed them to Eli Feldstein, a communications consultant working for Netanyahu, prosecutors said.",
      "Feldstein, 32, then tried to get the documents published in the media with the goal of showing that the hostage families' protests were playing into Hamas\u2019 hands, according to the prosecutors' filings, which were published Sunday.",
      "Feldstein acted \u201cwith the intention of influencing public opinion in Israel on the negotiations regarding the hostages and in particular the issue of the contribution of the demonstrations to the strengthening of Hamas,\u201d prosecutors said.",
      "Their filings came after Netanyahu\u2019s chief of staff was questioned as part of a separate investigation into allegations that he tried to tamper with official phone logs from the day of Hamas' Oct. 7 terror attack, a police official told NBC News.",
      "Netanyahu has not been personally accused of wrongdoing in either case and his office denies the allegations, saying it is being targeted by politically motivated security officials attempting to undermine the government.",
      "The leak investigation, referred to in Israeli media as \u201cBibiLeaks,\u201d from the prime minister\u2019s nickname \u201cBibi,\u201d was launched after the German tabloid Bild published an article in early September based on leaked Hamas documents.",
      "The newspaper claimed it had obtained documents from the personal computer of Yahya Sinwar, the leader of Hamas, who was subsequently killed by Israeli forces in October.",
      "The documents, according to the Bild report, showed Hamas was not interested in a quick cease-fire and believed that the protests by hostage families would weaken Israel\u2019s negotiating position.",
      "The story was published at a time of intense public anger toward Netanyahu in Israel following the murder of six hostages, including Israeli American Hersh Goldberg Polin, by Hamas in late August.",
      "Days after it was published, Netanyahu cited the article as evidence of Hamas\u2019 intent \u201cto use psychological warfare on the hostage families\u201d and to put pressure on the Israeli government.",
      "But inside the Israeli military, the story\u2019s publication set off alarm bells. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said that the document cited by Bild was several months old and was not written by Sinwar, but instead a mid-level Hamas operative.",
      "Military leaders ordered an investigation into the leak of the document \u2014 which was classified as \u201ctop secret\u201d \u2014 and called in the police and the Shin Bet, Israel\u2019s domestic security agency.",
      "In Sunday\u2019s filings, prosecutors said that when Israeli media declined to publish the document because of military censorship rules, Feldstein went around the domestic censor by giving the document to the Bild newspaper in Germany. A Bild spokesman told NBC News that the newspaper does not comment on its sourcing.",
      "Feldstein was arrested in late October. The Israeli soldier accused of leaking the document to him has also been arrested, along with three other military personnel, prosecutors said.",
      "On Monday, Israeli prison authorities said Feldstein had been placed on suicide watch.",
      "Asked to comment on Sunday\u2019s court filings, Netanyahu's office referred NBC News to a statement from Nov. 12 that said police had invoked special powers reserved for national security cases to hold Feldstein in isolation and deny him access to a lawyer.",
      "\u201cIt hurts us very much that the lives of young people are being destroyed with idle claims to harm the Right-wing government,\u201d his office said. \u201cIn a democratic country people are not arrested because of a leak for 20 days in the basements \u2014 while preventing a meeting with a lawyer for many days \u2014 just to extract from them false statements against the Prime Minister.\u201d",
      "Netanyahu has a history of railing against Israeli law enforcement. In 2019, he became the first sitting prime minister in the country\u2019s history to be charged with a crime.",
      "He denies the litany of bribery, fraud and breach of trust allegations and has said the prosecution is politically motivated. His lawyers have repeatedly tried to delay trial proceedings, citing his wartime leadership responsibilities.",
      "The Hostage Family Forum said in a statement Monday that it was \u201cappalled by the ongoing efforts of individuals close to the prime minister to sabotage a potential hostage deal.\u201d",
      "The advocacy group, which represents hostages and their families has repeatedly\u00a0 criticized Netanyahu and his government over the negotiations to free those taken captive by Hamas during the Oct. 7 terror attacks. Around 100 people remain in captivity, although around a third are believed to be dead.",
      "Police are also investigating allegations against Tzachi Braverman, Netanyahu\u2019s chief of staff. Braverman was questioned for several hours last week but has not been arrested or charged, according to an Israeli police official briefed on the investigation.",
      "Police are looking into claims that Braverman falsified phone records from the morning of Oct. 7, the official said. The alleged alterations appear intended to make it look like Netanyahu sprung into action more quickly than he did.",
      "Braverman allegedly asked an aide to change phone records to make it look like a conversation that was logged as having occurred at 6.40 a.m. instead took place 11 minutes earlier, at 6.29 a.m., the official said. Braverman then changed the log himself in a handwritten note.",
      "The police investigation is completed and prosecutors will now make a decision on whether any charges are merited.",
      "Jack Chen, an attorney for Braverman, told NBC News that the situation was the result of a misunderstanding about the order of the phone calls during the chaotic early hours of the Hamas attack. He said Braverman had explained the misunderstanding to police, and they released him without any restrictive conditions.",
      "Netanyahu\u2019s office would not comment specifically on Braverman\u2019s questioning but pointed to an earlier statement made by the prime minister on Nov. 10.",
      "\u201cFor the past few days, my office has been under a wild and unrestrained attack,\u201d Netanyahu said at the time. \u201cThe goal is not to protect the security of the state. The goal is to promote an agenda of weakness and concessions during the war.\u201d"

      "The United Nations said armed men stole food and other aid from 98 trucks over the weekend, the largest single incident of its kind since the start of the war. It did not say who was behind the theft.",

      "The Hamas-run government had a police force of tens of thousands that maintained a high degree of public security before the war, but they have vanished from the streets in many areas after being targeted by Israeli strikes. Hamas says it has taken measures to prevent both looting and price-gouging in local markets.",
      "Hamas ignited the war in Gaza when its fighters stormed into Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting around 250. Around 100 hostages are still inside Gaza, at least a third of whom are believed to be dead.",
      "Israel\u2019s retaliatory offensive has killed over 43,800 Palestinians, more than half of them women and children, according to local health authorities, who do not distinguish between civilians and combatants in their toll. The war has left much of the territory in ruins and forced around 90% of Gaza\u2019s population of 2.3 million to flee, often multiple times."

    "story": [
      "LONDON \u2014 Britain\u2019s\u00a0King Richard III\u00a0was immortalized with the Shakespeare line \u201cA horse, a horse, my kingdom for a horse.\u201d",
      "Now state-of-the-art technology has revealed what it may have sounded like if he did indeed utter those words just before his death in 1485 at the Battle of Bosworth.",
      "Unlike the upper-class tones of his modern successors, the re-created king's voice has a more common and earthy twang as he recites a medieval manuscript in a display that opened Sunday at the Theatre Royal in the U.K\u2019s ancient city of York.",
      "The project, which is 10 years in the making, was the brainchild of British vocal coach Yvonne Morley-Chisholm, who approached a team based at Face Lab at the U.K.'s Liverpool John Moores University and has since enlisted the help of leading specialists across a number of fields to create the avatar.",
      "\u201cThat involved dentistry, physiotherapy, the craniofacial reconstruction, the original pronunciation, forensic psychology, all sorts,\u201d she told NBC News in a telephone interview Monday, adding that it took them \u201c10 long years\u201d to put \u201cthe pieces together in the puzzle, because we wanted this to be based on evidence.\u201d",
      "It is the latest episode in the history of the doomed monarch, who was king of England for just two years from 1483 until his death two years later at age 32.",
      "Just over 100 years later in 1592, Shakespeare vilified him as a hunchback, giving him the famous cry of despair about a horse as his last line. His body was later discovered beneath a parking lot in 2012.",
      "To help work out how Richard and his contemporaries might have sounded, Morley-Chisholm enlisted the help of professor David Crystal, a leading linguist and expert in 15th-century pronunciation.",
      "\u201cNothing like this has ever happened before,\u201d Crystal said in a telephone interview Monday. \u201cThis is as close as we can get. It\u2019s 90% or so accuracy.\u201d",
      "Crystal added that he created \u201cthe sound system\u201d of the era by looking at the spelling of the words, the rhymes that were around in the poetry of the time and what Richard\u2019s contemporaries wrote about the spelling and pronunciation of English.",
      "The result, he said, \u201cis not like any modern accent at all.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt has distinctive echoes of some modern accents, and the\u00a0predominant echo was definitely Yorkshire,\u201d he said, referring to the county in northern England known for its distinctive dialect.",
      "Richard made global headlines 12 years ago when his skeletal remains were found by British historian Philippa Langley in a parking lot in Leicester, a city around 100 miles north of the U.K.'s capital, London.",
      "CT scans of the skeleton have since helped scientists reconstruct his face and body, revealing that while he did have curvature of the spine, he was not the hunchback that Shakespeare portrayed.",
      "\u201cThe skeleton has ruled out all the myths,\u201d Morley-Chisholm said. \u201cHe did not have a limp, a withered arm, a hunchback. He was able to speak in public.\u201d",
      "\u201cWithout the discovery of his mortal remains, this project would not have been possible,\u201d she added.",
      "The skeleton also helped Morley-Chisholm find the actor that would eventually play the king\u2019s avatar.",
      "After 10 years of searching, she said she chose British actor Thomas Dennis because his face was such a good physical match. She then coached Dennis into the king\u2019s accent and personality.",
      "Langley was also involved in the project from the start, advising on Richard's character and personality by studying letters, diaries and public descriptions of the king, and looking at how that might affect the way he speaks.",
      "\u201cWhat we could then get was a probability, almost verging on certainty, of the recognized character of Richard III during his lifetime,\u201d she said in a telephone interview Monday. \u201cYou are seeing the most accurate portrayal of Richard III.\u201d",
      "Mathew Morris, a project officer at the University of Leicester's Archaeological Services, who was involved in the dig 12 years ago but not part of the avatar project, said the project was \u201ca brilliant step.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere is only so much you can learn from a skeleton,\u201d he said Monday. \u201cIt is creating a resource that is allowing people to then explore less tangible facets of his life in new and innovative ways. You just don\u2019t know what it\u2019s then going to inspire.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, Crystal said he was already imagining other famous faces and voices from the past being re-created.",
      "\u201cI think when people see it and hear it, then, you know, forget Richard.\u00a0Who else can we do?\u201d he said."

      "At the beach near her home south of Tokyo, Arimoto carefully sifts sand for tiny bits of plastic that she can mould into decorative tips to put on the false nails at her salon. She came up with the idea after taking part in community cleanups along the coast.",
      "\u201cI became aware of environmental issues the moment I saw with my own eyes just how much plastic waste was in the ocean,\u201d 42-year-old Arimoto said. \u201cI thought it was horrifying.\u201d",

To gather the raw materials, she uses a custom wheelchair to scour the nearby beach every month to gather microplastics that other cleaners might miss.",
      "To turn sea trash into treasure, Arimoto starts by rinsing the plastic in fresh water and then sorting it by color. She cuts the plastic into smaller pieces and places them into a metal ring before melting the plastic to form a colorful disc that can be attached to the artificial nails. Prices for a set start at 12,760 yen ($82.52).",
      "\u201cI know there are other things made of recycled materials, like toilet paper and other daily necessities, but I had no idea you could have nails too, that was a surprise,\u201d said salon customer Kyoko Kurokawa, 57.",
      "Arimoto acknowledges that her nail art is a drop in an ocean of plastic\u00a0pollution, but says raising consciousness of the problem is a step towards working together for a solution.",
      "\u201cI hope that by putting these in front of people\u2019s eyes, on their fingertips, they\u2019ll enjoy fashion while also becoming more aware of environmental issues,\u201d she said."
